I was very excited to take delivery of this product, which I wanted mostly so I could play existing, VR capable, games on PC.However, despite ""PC VR Compatible"" being one of the supposed selling points of the Quest 2, setting up to use the PC for playing games on Steam requires the purchase of a piece of software called ""Virtual Desktop"" and then requires you to ""sideload"" a patch on top of this. I ended up having to rely on a VR savvy friend to come over and use a Youtube walkthrough to help get this done.There is also an Oculus app to download to your PC and this will allow you to buy games. Only problem is that games bought through this app aren't downloadable to the Quest and must be played tethered to the PC. WTF, especially, when this isn't stated clearly on the purchase page?Intriguingly, while there are sales on the non-transferable games that you can buy using the oculus PC app, literally none of the games inside the oculus version of the store are on sale. For example, I bought one game through the PC app (50% off) expecting to be able to download and play it through my oculus, but when I discovered I could not I also discovered that the same app was still full price inside the Quest version of the store.A major problem is that there really isn't any good content for the Quest at this stage. What little there is, is hugely expensive, charging AAA prices for CCC games. I'm very much into open world games, for which VR should be perfect, but most Quest games seem to involve standing still and overcoming waves of enemies. Expect to spend hundreds of dollars in the search of good VR content.I was also quite disappointed with the quality of the build. At the very least, I would have expected glass, rather than easily damaged plastic for the lenses, especially given how easily they fog up. The headband is a disaster, forcing you to spend yet more money and the price that Oculus wants for both this and its ""Link"" cable is criminal.My advice? This device (and probably VR as a whole) simply isn't ready for prime time. Hold off until the next generation of VR, or if you must buy it, wait until there is some halfway decent content.The fact that most of my time with the unit has been spent watching Amazon Prime inside a Virtual cinema says much about the current capabilities of the technology.

Buyer beware.....it was good while it lasted.  My $600 paperweight has a headset tracking error that Oculus Support have not been able to solve or repair/replace under warranty in over 3 weeks. I am not confident they know what to do nor care to fix my problem. What ever the answer is, I can say that a reset back to factory default is NOT the answer.  Maybe I was just unlucky, perhaps you will be ok. I think its important to note how many head tracking errors have been popping up that Oculus is slow to acknowledge and respond to.After weeks of waiting I finally was advised to return the headset and all components to an address in Hong Kong.I spend $85 to send back and was promised a replacement Oculus Quest 2 would be sent out. Its now 2 months later and I have no replacement! Emails to Oculus support has not provided me with any satisfaction as what the status is. Cannot recommend dealing with Oculus

With the ability to play PC VR as well as standalone at near 2k per eye with zero screen door affect it's worth it. The tracking is perfect and the guarding system is one of the best and this is coming from a former light house lazer tracking user having owned a HTC Vive.It, however, needs the elite head strap for comfort so spend the extra money and if you have any left get the KIWI design or the VR power Battery Pack for the Quest Headset. This will not only double or triple your battery life but it'll act as a counter weight to the headset and make it even more comfortablemust have apps:Virtual DesktopOnwardSaints and SinnerArizona Sunshine

I wasn’t really impressed with purchasing the oculus quest 2 I thought it would have different stuff also maybe some different songs in Beatsaber but it’s all exactly the same as the original oculus quest that my son has also the head strap for the Oculus quest 2 is very uncomfortable and I can never get it to sit on my head properly and it’s blurry. The Oculus quest head strap for the original is a little better than they have made for the Quest 2. Not really happy with it.

This is my 3rd VR headset (not including Gear VR)and it is by far my favourite. I have owned the PSVR and Vive Cosmos and despite this being the cheapest it has a better display and controller tracking. With the recent link cable update this works great as a PCVR Headset. The only drawbacks are the strap is meh and the foam cover is pretty bad which means you need to buy some additional accessories if you intend to use this more than casually. Despite this, I strongly recommend buying this if you have even a slight curiosity about VR.

Plays games in VR. Check. Looks decent in game. Check. Great range of games to play (Half Life Alyx I'm looking at you). Check. Crappy strap that comes with the unit. Yep. Don't like the strap at all. Will invest in the QUEST 2 ELITE STRAP. The weight of this unit feels as if it's constantly falling forward. Hopefully the replacement strap will help with that.Overall the Quest 2 is awesome. I had the PSVR and the original HTC Vive which were both ok but in comparison the Quest 2 is soooooooooo much better. And the option to play both wireless and tethered is a HUGE bonus.

No matter what I do (changing where it rests on my head, the pupil distance, cleaning the lenses etc) everything remains slightly blurred and the text will constantly have a glow/halo effect, making it hard to read and or focus in games. Watching supposedly 4K videos isn't very awe-inspiring as everything looks 480p, maybe choppy 720p at best.There is also barely any games or apps on the actually Oculus app making the headset basically useless unless it's linked to a computer. Not an ""expansive"" Quest content library by any means.I personally regret having wasted my money and will be returning the product. If you're sensitive to motion sickness, bright lights, migraines etc, definitely don't buy even if you only get those things every once in a while. Hell, if you get sinus problems or hate how certain materials feel on your face this headset will probably bother you. I also received an email from Amazon about an ""Important Product Safety Notification"" about the foam used with the removable foam facial interface. Apparently on some products, the foam part has been causing people to have skin irritations and is being recalled.

Being my first VR device, I've had great experience with this device so far. I don't have any issues with signing in with Facebook and the black levels are awesome, despite being a LCD panel instead of OLED! The only downside I've noticed is that there is some significant godrays, but I don't have anything to compare it to, so it's not something I'm too picky about. Another thing to mention is that it only has 3 IPD settings to choose from, which is quite general and may not cater perfectly for everyone unfortunately. The included fabric/elastic strap is quite comfortable actually, though I do have the Elite strap on pre-order, I'm quite comfortable to use this on my own. The only reason I'm getting the Elite strap is because I will be sharing this device with my family, so quick adjustments with the elite strap would just make it so much easier.

I was initially worried about the shortcuts taken to release a headset at this price, but the Quest 2 has exceeded almost all my expectations. I had no trouble with my main concern, the limited IPD adjustment, and even the headstrap (which I'd been prepared to upgrade immediately).The roughly 2 hour battery life (stand alone) is about as long as I'm likely to spend in a single sitting, although it'd be nice if there was some form of fast charge available. Charge times longer than battery life seems a bit out of place on a modern device.Tracking is excellent, and the standalone performance really is amazing for a mobile platform. That said the hand tracking is definitely nowhere near as fast or precise as the controllers, so hopefully that continues to be developed.The increased resolution leaves none of the ""screen door effect"" of earlier VR, and as long as there's gamma adjustment I don't have an issue with the comparative lack of contrast the LCD has compared to OLED.Integrated speakers lack a bit in terms of bass, but are good enough in terms of quality, and great for maintaining awareness of your surroundings and communication with anyone in the room. Using a headset for additional immersion and audio quality is easy enough with the single headphone jack anyway.The integrated mic also does a good job. It's perfectly clear without picking up an excess of environmental noise.To start with the software implementation was lagging a bit behind, but recent updates have enabled both 90hz and native resolution for Oculus Link in PCVR use. At the moment I still use Virtual Desktop for PCVR wireless connectivity, but at some point I'm sure Oculus will catch up there as well.My only remaining criticism is that I really prefer open platforms, and the Quest 2 is definitely a ""walled garden"" in regards to it's facebook account requirements, needing a mobile phone for setup and so far a lack of any jailbreak/rooting to allow access to hardware options Oculus hasn't implemented.That said I'd still recommend it, and hopefully this kicks off a much larger uptake of VR, resulting in more attention and major title releases from large developers (although Halflife Alyx and The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners are a great start).

Don't buy the 256gb headset... YOU WON'T NEED THE SPACE as there is no way to install games from your computer onto the headset it only stores occulus store games or media files.Purchasing a headstrap with more support is necessary for enjoyable gaming.The battery only lasts 2 hours from a full charge, a purchase of an external battery that can be attached to certain headstraps can be used to alleviate the short battery life.Don't cheap out on a charging cable or you may end up with a cable that won't actually charge the headset to full while you are playing it, instead it just prolongs the battery life.In order to play steam VR games you must purchase ""Virtual Desktop"" on the occulus store for like $30~ and install it the program on your computer as well.Games on the occulus store are very expensive and rarely come down in price comparatively to VR games on steam.The headset itself is fairly affordable however all the extra things required to make it enjoyable do add up, also you MUST use a facebook account to use the headset.

This device refused to connect with my network login, I spent hours on trying different solutions with my phone and the headset itself. I then logged on to a site called Reddit with the search term specific to connecting to WiFi and discovered a multitude of unhappy campers like myself. A friend asked where i purchased it from..I told her Amazon, she replied that her partner purchased his from Hong Kong and that might be my problem, I tried to explain that Oculus was Oculus regardless of where it was or from whom it was purchased. Any way I will be returning it. The support platform offered from Oculus is abysmal.

Pros:+ It is astonishingly affordable. Without a doubt, Facebook is selling it with a loss.+ Completely wireless system provides the best VR experience you can have. Even though there are technically better headsets, none of them are wireless. You don't need to set up any cameras either, just great.+ Seeing the room without taking off the headset is a great option to have (although image quality is abysmal)+ Speakers are much louder than expected so you don't need a headphone (mostly)+ It is very easy to connect it to Steam VR so you can even play PC VR games wirelessly with ease.Cons:- You need an active Facebook account to use it, there is no alternative. This is the catch here. You are giving them every data you can have.- Battery life is not very good, 2-3 hours max. You have to charge it after every session or get a very long USB-C cable.- Controllers work with an AA battery, they don't have rechargeable batteries.- Quality of the straps and the pad is mediocre. Though, they can be easily replaced with third party options.In short, I can recommend it to everyone as long as you are aware of its downsides.

Much better than expected, the interface, graphics and smoothness of the headset is incredibly accurate, quick, and super clear.Only beef I have with it when using it with PC is that there is little to no instructions, you have to download the Oculus Link app for PC from their website before you use it, and in addition to that, you really need to buy a 5Gbps USB C cable that's a minimum 2m long to use with pc, otherwise you'll rip the cable out.once its all connected properly, you just literally click on the monitor you wanna use while wearing it and away you go.

This ones really good. You can use it stand alone. Or connect it to your gaming PC with wire or wireless using a dualband 5GHz wifi router with minimal lag. The FOV is not as good as Super expensive like valve, but the resolution is better. So its a trade off. I didnt find the FOV concerning, but good enough to be used. There is no setting up of satellite sensors like big branded ones as the tracking is built into the headset and the tracking is superb.The built in software is very nice and there is everything you could ask for and more as a beginner into VR. This is the most entertaining thing when guests come to our house as well. One of the best purchases ever.VR headsets have entered many phases since its development. After using this, I can confidently say its reached a phase where people can buy this without worrying about quality/issues assosiated with early stages. Only downside, Sukerburg collects your data.

After owning a Quest 1 which I was happy with and still am, I decided to Purchase Quest 2. I use both my Quest headsets for 360 & 180 videos on You Tube and Prime and Netflix videos. I have only 2 games but will buy more in the future.The Quest 2 really ups the bar for watching You Tube 360 & 180 videos with better clarity than the Quest 1.  It also has greater detail in the games that I own. The head-strap does not bother me along with the compulsory Facebook login although I did get locked out for a week like many others. The only con I have encountered so far are when watching dark scenes in movies. The Quest 2 (single LCD) displays Dark Black scenes as a greyish colour not unlike an old computer monitor. The Quest 1 (Dual Oleds) watching the same movie showed crisp Blacks throughout.Looking forward to better games in the future for the Quest 2 as it has a lot of untapped potential .

Very solid build quality, controllers feel nice in your hand, and the user interface when you put the headset on is very, very immersive. I bought this headset to use for wireless VR gaming on my PC which can be done with this headset amazingly (assuming you have a WIFI6 modem and decent Ethernet connection to your PC it will work best with this setup) just remember when you buy the program called ‘Virtual Desktop’ to play PC VR without a cord that you buy it directly from the Oculus store with the app on your phone, it will not work if you purchase it from Steam (I made the mistake of getting it on Steam because it was about $9.00 cheaper at the time but when using SideQuest to upload it to the Oculus headset it would upload the files but the headset never recognised the purchase). The reason it has to be purchased on the oculus store is the headset itself is made by oculus (obviously) and it has an Oculus game store, so by purchasing it on the Oculus store it will recognise the purchase and allow you to add it to the headset much easier with SideQuestDefinitely do a bit of research before buying this for streaming VR to your PC.But if you just want it for Standalone VR you absolutely can’t get any better value for money than the Oculus Quest 2 headset. I played a few free games using SideQuest and it was a great experience, but in the end the headset wasn’t for me. If you’re looking at buying something like this I personally feel like it’s a huge lifestyle / commitment and I don’t know if it’s the type of thing you’d buy to play Beat Saber once or twice every month. It blew me away seeing everything you can do with this headset, I just knew I don’t have the time to sit down and enjoy it all!

Great product, Terrible quality controlI've been using the Quest 2 on and off for nearly a month now.The Quest 2 is an awesome product for the price. It's been fantastic.However The Quest 2 has 2 cameras that are used for passthrough (The ability to see infront if you with the headset on) the first Quest 2 I recieved had Had a growing number of dead pixels (Stuck at bright white) in the left passthrough camera starting out at 2 dead pixels and growing to 6 by the end of the first week, Amazon were helpful in senting out a replacement and providing printable labels to put on the box to send my first Quest back.The second Quest 2 I recieved also had dead pixels, but in the right passthrough camera this time. believing that the product I ordered shouldn't have flaws like this I asked amazon customer support what I should do about it and they sent out another replacement.I recieved the 3rd Quest 2 today and yet again there are dead pixels in one of the passthrough cameras, and also one in the main screens themselves.I am giving up trying to get a unflawed product and I am just going to stick with the 2nd Quest as the passthrough dead pixels were not growing in number and the screens themselves are fine.I hope you all have better luck then I.3 defective/flawed products. fortunately its cheap so I'll just keep the best of the bunch unless more problems appear.

Had more than I expected. When I went to purchase the 64gb model it was unavailable because of the skin issues they were facing, but when I went to check last week, not only were they back but they had double the storage for the same price. Now this didn't really affect me as i purchased this for my PC, but still it's great. The Headset itself is fairly straightforward, and the controls are quick to get used to. Oculus' airlink is a reliable alternative to using a cord for a pc, and I have been able to play ALL games from my steam library. 1 feature i wasn't planning on the quest having was desktop mirroring, but it's implemented in a way that let's you have multiple windows open and still see them. and you can place those windows wherever you want, effectively giving you a multi-monitor experience.

I so wanted to love this, but unfortunately this isn't as good as I thought it would be. Was expecting crisp and clear images, and the blurry images no matter the adjustments made to the straps, removing and inserting the spacer or playing around with the fixed IPD settings made no difference for me.

Very disappointed in VR. Absolutely not recommended for use with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. They are painfully uncomfortable to wear. Slightest jolt and visual acuity is lost and find constantly readjusting the device position. After 45 to 60 minutes find the discomfort so unbearable it's past due to remove them and return to normal PC game play. My personal opinion is the battery should not be in the headset and attached to perhaps a shoulder to make them lighter. The developers have given very little thought to a practical comfortable design. 360 view graphic quality is worse than a commodore 64. 80's technology. It is 2022 and I expect far better than this. Viewing videos such as Netflix is wonderful giving a cinema experience in the home, however, back to comfort of the headsets I found after watching for example Netflix with the illusion of a cinema like experience the headset became so unbearably uncomfortable I had to stop watching, and continue watching on my Sony TV. The contrast is rubbish on headset. Rounding up, visual quality is VHS (SD and worse than that in 360 view) and they are very uncomfortable and cause headaches and would not be surprised if long term eye damage is caused from prolonged use.

To really enjoy the experience you do need a lot of floor space otherwise you end up knocking the controls against the wall.Some of the games do give the feeling of motion sickness but most of them also have comfort mode too.The base strap isnt that comfortable and if you are sharing the device among alot of people with different head shapes I recommend getting one of other custom ones with the easy adjusting control.I have had some trouble running games from steam and some other PC games like Minecraft but all of the Oculus store games work fine.

This is the best all in one VR headset currently available. 5 stars because you can also link to your PC to run games like Half Life Alyx and Elite Dangerous. Make sure you get yourself a good link cable. I got a 5 meter USB 3.0 extension and then a 3 meter link cable with the right angled type C end at the Oculus that includes velcro to secure it to the headset. Air link is Ok but can be unreliable if you don't have a very good, high speed, access point close by.

Glad they included the silicone Cover and the 128gb is definitely the perfect sweet spot BUT, the comfort sucks, the speakers/headphone things are too far forward and while they sound good if the sound is cupped like with your hands, in open air its just not great.A 2m USBC cable would have been nice instead of 1m, and the head strap pretty uncomfortable if playing longer than 15 mins.Those flaws are mostly fixed by third party accessories but just sell a better equipped option in the first place.

Thing is absolutely amazing you guys everything that you expect from VR has been delivered and then some. For the price it stands up to everything by far. The only competition with this thing is and will be, is the PlayStation VR. Except you don't need a PlayStation or a cable which after using both is liberating not being tethered. Tracking on Oculas is amazing with and without the controls! Yes without the controls! I tracks your hands! Clunky but does it well (you won't use it yet)The only downside is the content library isn't stuffed but and it's an important but every game is quality. 100% a good purchase very rare can I say something is truly well designed and I can't express how impressed I am. I spent 2hrs dancing with the robot, throwing paper planes and shooting rockets at a dirigible in the intro when you start the thing upI couldn't make up my mind which VR I wanted cos weighing reviews is hard without knowing yourself.

I've been wanting to grab an Oculus 2 for awhile now aand eventually bit the bullet. I have dabbled in VR when I got a Gear VR for Samsung and that was pretty decent for it's time and I've also owned a PSVR in the past. I've only used the Oculus for a couple of hours and I have to say that it is a great piece of equipment.I like the fact that you can take it anywhere and play., The screen is nice and clear and I can't see any scren door effect. I've only played Beatsaber, Rollercoaster game and Saint's & Sinners. It takes some getting used to regarding movement and it was causing some nausea with Saints & Sinners, no issues with Beatsaber. I guess it's to do with looking around and moving at the same time. I suspect I will get used to it over time.The sound is nice and clear too, I wasn't expecting it to sound that good. You can still hear if someone is talking to you and yet enough to be immersed in the game. The headset strap isn't much of an issue for me although I can see how people feel like it's too tight for them, pushing against the face.I will definitely be grabbing a link cable so I can play using my PC and will look at other accessories too.No regrets.

I can't really compare to other headsets, but the Quest 2 gives alot of bang for buck. I really enjoy the untethered experience, and if you want more power then it's possible to do PCVR over Oculus Link. When there was a flaw in my first headset (dead pixel), I was able to get it replaced and I was able to re-download my games (I think save states will vary from game to game though. I believe it depends on what the dev implemented).Set up is pretty painless but just remember to get a Facebook account as this is a requirement for this headset. It took a day to activate a new account. I personally don't care for the Facebook integration. If you take a screen grab or video the Android OS will suggest you share it on Facebook, essentially turning the user into an advertisement.Despite these annoyances, it's pretty impressive tech. Great resolution in the headset, no need for external sensors, a decent library of software. Just be wary of the stuff mentioned above. And take notes on what accessories you might need. Elite strap? Extra battery? Carry case? Oculus Link cable? Better fitting? Controller grips?

Great first headset. I've tried the Rift S which was comparably similar, but the Quest 2's higher resolution makes pretty much anything seem pretty good with little to no screen door affect. Since my IPD is around 70mm everting always seems a bit blurry other then the exact sweets pot, but honestly you wont notice when actually playing something. Honestly you don't need to worry too much about IPD so if you are, don't be. It'll be an amazingly fun ride regardless. But I do recommend you get something to clean the lenses as they accumulate oils and moisture overtime which can make everything seem blurry. Just be careful not to scratch them lenses though.Overall, great experience, modest battery size (given any longer than the 2-3 hour playtime is a bit disorienting and destroys depth perception at first (emphasis on the AT FIRST since now I'm fine, it like motion sickness, you'll get over it), comfortable fit (given silicone cover which you should DEFINETLY use), great tracking, great support, Facebook sign in didnt bother me since you can hide Oculus activity from your actual Facebook account upon setup, and good game library (sure pricey but free ones are good and browser offers many experiences (moonrider beatsaber alternative mainly)).So yeah. Good headset. Motion sickness / depth perception will suffer at first but that's to be expected if its your first time anyways, good price since the 128GB re-release and no real need to worry about IPD, its not noticeable when in-game.Good headset, good times.

First of all, while I have spent hundreds of dollars on games, both on Steam and from the Oculus store, I don't play them for hours on end, and normally have small sessions, so I may not be too bothered by a lot of the issues presented by other reviewers. Each session could just be a few minutes to perhaps 30 minutes, but so far nothing longer than that. The battery normally last multiple sessions at least. Another thing is that the $479 cost seems perfectly reasonable to me and although my playtime is short I still personally get value out of it.-Build quality is fine with me.-Strap is fine with me, easy enough to adjust, holds the headset in position on my head/face, during my short sessions I've not really encountered any issues with pain or comfort. I was considering buying a 3rd party strap but some reviews mention various quality issues which puts me off, plus I don't know if I really need one.-I wear glasses and initially I had some trouble getting the headset on/off, but seem to have adjusted now and during recent sessions I've have not been bothered with this. I've not really had much of an issue with foggy lenses so far.-The VR gaming experience is just awesome.-You have to log in with a Facebook account, which I was initially bothered by but in the end just let it go.-The VirtualDesktop app is something you can use to play SteamVR games and Oculus PC games wirelessly on your Quest2. You can get by with 2.4GHz wifi for some games, but you really need to use 5GHz for the best experience (some games were too jittery over 2.4GHz). You can use Airlink but the quality doesn't seem as good as VirtualDesktop from what I can see so far. Initially I had trouble getting wireless to work. I had to switch my Windows network to Private and ensure only one network adapter was present (I initially had a bunch of Hyper-V NICs installed for my VMs and for whatever reason they interferred and prevented me from finding my PC from the Quest2). If you're more skilled than I you can probably work out the reason and not be troubled by this.

I have been very interested in VR for a number of years. I have tried a wireless Vive Pro but lackluster battery and tracking issues were many due to the wireless link being fairly unreliable. I was saving for a Valve index but due to insane shipping and importing taxes it was going to cost me $3,000 aud. Then along comes the Quest 2. Great tracking, decent battery which can be extended easily, great performance considering its portable nature. I think the social aspect coming from Facebook actually enhances the experience OR you can just ignore the fact that its there. 10/10.

I've loved using my Oculus, it's certainly impressed myself and friends/family with the in home experience this console offers. Games are purchased from the platform and most of the games I've purchased and played are entertaining and fun. There have been a couple of issues with the software built in, which are glitchy at times, but Oculus (Facebook owned) seem to have them fixed up promptly with software updates etc. You will need a clear and open space to get the best use from a VR Experience, I used mine outdoors mostly for that reason. Definitely a great purchase!

At first this feels comfortable compared to the quest 1 and it doesn't want to slide off your face.  That's because it is crushing your face and after about 20 minutes- 30 minutes of ACTIVE play everyone I know has had a headache (or faceache) and finds it hard to play any longer.  Most reviewers online say the elite strap with the batter pack solves this completely with the battery pack's counterweight being a perfect 2 in 1 whilst extending gameplay time.  Unforuntately at the time of writing this review Oculus/Facebook were hoarding all supplies of the elite strap plus battery for their US customers only leaving us, down here in OZ, without any consideration.  I hear some of the third party solutions work well and the elite strap (without batter pack) MAY do the job but the overwhelming advice online has been to get the battery pack version.  I haven't seen reviews of the third party offering but they usually fill the gaps Oculus ignores (like silicon face covers which are an absolute necessity - don't even play until you get one ordered in - the $20 ones you see on amazon AU are just fie.Otherwise it seems pretty snappy (pardon the pun) with the newer spapdragon CPU and the higher resolution is a tradeoff for the dynamics of the Quest 1.  (I prefer the Quest 1 because the colour simply look  better but higher resolution games may change my mind when they start coming out properly instead of being hacked together or upscaled.  The battery lives of the controllers are... miraculously improved.  I do not like the very slight change in design of the controllers themselves (slightly heavier with more girth) but that may simply be what I'm used to.  So while this is a very, very good, top quality VR Headset for the price they've managed that price by skimping on some basic stuff (like pure sweat-soaking face cushion by default and a cheaper strapping mechanism.All that said - some people claim to prefer the shipped strap proving, as usual, that you cannot make a universal fit for every head type out there.  As for the tech - like the Quest 1 this is a VR gamechanger in that it brings the tech to the masses WITHOUT tether and it's potential for fitness and wellbeing, never mind gaming, is a milestone in tech that we'll look back on in 5-10 years and realise just how much of a lifechanger this device can be for many people.  The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 is because I think they skimped on a few things to get the price down and I find that facebook completely swallowing Oculus and requiring you to register you headset to your facebook account a little too much.  It's  not anything that other companies wouldn't do but other companies aren't the ubiquitous facebook.TLDR;  Buy this thing.  Couple of shortcomings but best bang for buck on the market for far and complete untethered VR Joy.  This tech changed my life in terms of wellbeing and fitness.  It could do the same for many others.

Cheapest quality VR unit on the market, the downside - and a very big downside - is it is locked to the Facebook ecosystem, so you have to join/rejoin facebook to use it. Other issues are well documented in forums - especially how it has problems interfacing with STEAM Library or games/content stored externally to the headset. Also the 128gb storage fills up very quickly. Battery life is about 2 hours. Your head can get hot playing it for long periods.

Didn't get a chance to use the original occulus headsets but coming from wmr for 3 years this is such a step up in image quality and tracking its not funny. The oled in my odyssey+ from samshart got discontinued as soon as I bought it not happy with them or Windows as wmr is basically dead no updates no support. I know Facebook meta isn't great but this product is especially the streaming options like alvr airlink and occulus link which absolutely shart over HTC valve and pimax wireless solutions.My only complaint is that the battery life isn't great due to having to constantly recharge and no fast charging but for 300 bucks that's a trade off you have to make. It's a shame the premium elite headrest and battery got recalled as they should be included and no so overpriced.Again image quality and tracking are so good compared to outside in and inside out from others its not worth bothering with them.120hz 4k also streams well if you have a good router pc and wifi Ethernet connectiononly downside is that the included cover AND aftermarket options like VR Cover are uncomfortable

The product itself is the best VR I have experienced in the home. I don't think I'll play my PSVR again as this thing is just so much more immersive.The reason I haven't given 5 stars is because of the store.My Quest 2 was charging so I thought I would buy games on the Android phone app.Little did I know that even though I only have the Quest 2 registered the store let's you purchase apps for other Oculus devices.I wanted Beat Saber and purchased it.Once I put the Quest 2 on the app wasn't there.I had no idea what had happened since the other game I purchased in the app store was available to install.After googling and testing thing's on the app I realised I had purchased Beat Saber for the Rift and not Quest.I was shocked that the purchase didn't cover all Oculus products, the Rift version I bought didn't carry over to Quest app list and I had to pay for Beat Saber separately for Quest!The app defaulting to the Rift store when I don't own a Rift is pretty bad and there was nothing during the purchase process that alerted me that I was buying the game for Rift only.Fantastic device that I am going to play everyday! Love this thing.Purchasing apps is a different experience and I hope they make some changes so users can clearly see what the are buying is compatible with specific devices and not all Oculus apps work on all headsets.

This is great indoor fun and while you can operate in a small area suggest 2mtr square as a min. Headset works outside but the controllers do not in brighter then typical indoor. Games are amazing, cheap AUD$50, compared to traditional game units. We use as stand alone brilliant to swing around with out cords. Batt life not bad considering and the cast feature allows others to laugh (or scream) with you.  There’s a good mix of games and a good number but would like to see more and more often, graphics not bad either. I wear glasses (multifocal) little fiddley getting on/off but overall comfortable.

Every review I see attests to my experience. Quest 2 is a great initial experience into VR at an affordable price; unless you don't want to create a Facebook account as it is mandatory to use the Quest 2. The icing on the cake is getting it to connect wirelessly to your PC (not required to have a great experience as it works stand alone. Wifi from PC is not an out of the box option but plenty of guides). Motion sickness does need to be managed - there are options to ease your introduction, don't ignore them. VR via Quest 2 is not a passive experience it is best enjoyed on you feet. I was not disappointed and have recommended to friends who have limited tech investment.

Brilliant Cheap VR.But that strap alone reduces this by 3 Stars.When buying this expect to dish out more money to buy a better strap because the experience is awful.I wouldn't be surprised if people would rather eat cat poo then wear that retched strap.After putting it on for the first time and making minor adjustments it fit perfectly, Next time I put it on, it's terrible, it took me 2 hours to make the strap at the right length so that it doesn't crush my head or put the headset inside my nose, these 2 hours of making adjustments, putting it on, realizing it doesn't fit, taking it off, and repeating this process made me nearly vomit because I kept going from real life into the digital world repeatedly.This strap ruined the experience and I would immediately recommend for people to buy a new strap ASAP.

Got one of these to kill boredom during the COVID-19 lockdown and for flight simulation VR.Very immersive and great fun, though my wife thinks I look silly using it (I do). However, while I understand the steps taken to reduce weight and cost by changing the head strap from the Quest 1 to Quest 2 - the current fabric strap really sucks. After even moderate usage in either swimming or standing  my head really hurts and I cannot get it to be comfortable at all.An extra $40 and a third part halo strap (similar to what is on the PS4 VR headset is on the way and it will be much better.So far games have been excellent, low cost and really fun.Worth it with the up grade.

After all my research on the Oculus Quest 2, Amazon Prime was the best possible deal. The price may sting for some, I was lucky enough to have a gift card to help me out. The experience for what you get out of it is worth it though.It's absolutely true that the headset strap is hella uncomfortable after playing for some time and troublesome to adjust but there's an alternative you can buy - the elite strap. My purchase included the silicone cover which I completely forgot to put on the foam pad, so I can't quite say yet how that feels like but anything is better than the default foam pad.Another negative jab is at Facebook itself. There does not seem to be a way to play the Oculus without having a Facebook profile. This shouldn't be forced upon users who wish to play a VR headset and have fun. At the end of the day, Facebook (or should I say Meta) has implemented this to help improve the product. There is no need to worry about privacy as you can hide your activity in your settings.I bought Resident Evil 4 VR for this headset and it'll be the only game I buy on the Oculus. There's no shortage of games but they are pricey and it's still early days for their library. The rest of my VR games will be played on Steam using the Oculus Quest 2.

This is one of the best stand alone VR headsets. The tracking is so good you forget your holding controllers and use them like hands. The range of games is growing with each getting better. The added bonus of being able to connect to a computer for PC VR games is a winner. Oculus are fazing out the rift and working mainly on the quest 2 so expect big things to come. My only issue is downloading the games needs a steady internet as if it drops out it starts over. Good if you have fast wifi but when you live in the country and need to hotspot off a phone at slow speed, a 7gig game can restart several times. A feature to Continue where it left off would be so much better.All in all a fantastic gaming device

I thought I'd finally take the plunge in to VR, mainly out of curiosity rather than because I was expecting to get a huge amount of use out of it. I was expecting it to just be a bit of a novelty for a while, and I've been very pleasantly surprised.I've been using this thing daily and loving every minute of it. For the amount of tech built in to this thing, they must be losing money on every unit sold. The ability to use it wirelessly was huge for me. Not only does it have its own built in hardware that doesn't require a PC, you can still connect to your pc via your wifi to play the more hardware-intensive titles and games that aren't part of the Oculus ecosystem. So you get the best of both worlds. And neither requires cables. Super cool piece of kit.

Coming off the OG Vive this is the next step up.  I was very skeptical of the audio setup, linking to the PC, and the tracking - but have been blown away.  If it were not for the whole forced facebook gig, it would be absolutely perfect.  I just used my wife's account to get it going.  Such an increase in every way over the Vive.  All of my existing games/sims run at a higher framerate due to the increased bandwidth either Airlinked or Virtual Desktop linked.  I have ordered a link cable but it has not arrived.  All in all, really good.  I would recommend a halo strap straight away as the base strap is not comfortable for hour+ long sessions in my opinion.

I was a little worried it would be banned because the facebook had no friends or profile. I made it awhile back though. Maybe if you are buying this and needing to make a new facebook you could join some groups to show some activity lol. I think the plastic of the machine does feel a little bit cheap however, HTC VIVE all starts at 2k etc which is very expensive.

Used Quest 1 and upgraded to Quest 2. The resolution has much higher and screen door effect is gone. This is the best wireless VR headsets at the moment. The straps may be less comfortable than the Quest 1 but not much, which I am going to get a 3rd elite strap very soon. Relationship with Facebook raise privacy concerns definitely, especially if consuming adult contents is one of your purpose of the headset.

It’s great for a everyone  in our family ..12 to adult ages. Great graphics, feels very real!!! Also, great to get you moving- a workout while having a blast on best saber. Games are a little pricey so the cost is more than just buying the headset. The headset band seems to have stretched already in the 10 days my family have used it and can make for uncomfortable play. This really is the only negative.Also, if multiple people will be playing it, then purchase some silicon covers to keep it hygienic.

This is my first VR headsets. I have used others briefly,  but never owned one.  I am quite impressed by the quality of the product and the easy of use. I haven't yet used with a computer with it, as I am waiting for the cable. Vader Immortal played really nice, also Beat Saber. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a not-so-expensive headset with great games and quality.

It’s actually more better than I thought it’d be. It arrived at 8pm which I thought was late but it was on time. You do have to pay for most games though, but I love it. It’s a bit complicated to use at the start and the straps are a pain to deal with but I say it’s worth it. You’ll get the hang of using it. I had a bit of trouble at first but started getting the idea.

I had a go at this at my sisters house as her hubby had one ... well it’s great fun !!! Good for a few friends to take turns into beating each other’s scores,, so I ordered it and the next day it arrived and my wife and I had so much fun together we are thinking of getting another one 🥳👍🏼 Well worth the money but I’d advise you to get the one with the larger memory as you will want to keep as many games stored in it as possible!! Plenty of things to learn about it ,, the only downturn is that you didn’t get it sooner, also have a good break from it now and then because you can get motion sickness.... well I did anyway. Oh and set up your phone with the relevant app so when it arrives you can get started ASAP. Fantastic purchase and thanks Amazon for making the purchase trouble free👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS SYSTEM!!!

The Oculus Quest 2 is a highly intuitive and advanced piece of VR technology. The design is streamlined, compact. Set-up and use is very simple and easy to grasp. Graphics and user-interface is also of the highest quality.One suggestion - the official Oculus Case is somewhat confusing, as the headset and controllers don't slide in very well. However, overall, this product is highly recommendable - anyone looking for a premium, easy-to-use VR headset should look no further than this latest headset from Oculus.

Needing a Facebook account aside this headset is great as a standalone or PC headset. If you have a good wireless 6 router is works flawlessly with Steam VR games wireless as well. The cord on my Rift S was the biggest grip I had with it and this has better visuals.My only gripe is that I need to buy all the games I have on Steam again to play standalone and it doesn't play any of the hundreds of dollars worth of Gear VR content I own.

The SDE is virtually unnoticeable with mostvideo content and the response speed is a great improvement over that provided by the Oculus GO.Disliked the securing straps,too soft finiky to adjust ,I have still to find the best setup.I will probably buy a 3rd partyproduct when they become available.Summary; I am very pleased with my purchase.

This is by far the best VR available if value and convenience is included in the consideration.No need to setup sensors or deal with the issues that come with PCVR.Tracking is almost perfect, there are a few blind spots but they are barely noticeable. The only kinda noticeable blind spot is in shooters when aiming you're main hand sometimes looses tracking if you have it too close to your face.The resolution of the headset is incredible (although you have to set it higher with sidequest to get the most out of the screen).The new XR2 chip makes games super smooth, I rarely get any stuttering or lag.If you're on the fence about VR, this is definitely worth biting the bullet for.

The quest 2 is so good that the quality of objects in the game looks way better than last year oculus quest, cause this is basically better in quality you will get immersed in the games. The last generation quest was ok but It did not immerse me that much as the quest 2 is doing. I recommend this product for people upgrading from the following, quest 1/PSVR.

This is an awesome product, but getting it working did cause a few issues.  The graphics card needs to be large enough to work VR programmes.  Ours wasn't, the choice was to purchase another GCard @ around $500 and find someone to install it, or we chose to purchase a gaming computer  $$ which we did.  Also you need a 3metre cable to attach Oculus Quest 2 to comp to play other downloaded games.  Once the issues were overcome it was all worth it.

Apart from essentially being forced to buy the Elite headstrap (the one it comes with is too flimsy to carry the weight comfortably), the product is great as advertised. I still play my PSVR (wired) as it is a classic in my opinion, but the Oculus Quest 2 is hands down the most advanced of the wireless stand alone headsets. Wouldn’t recommend if you own the previous Oculus as the upgrades might not be too noticeable, but if this is your entry point into VR, go for it and enjoy!

The best VR headset on the market. Games I would think are boring if they were regular video games all of a sudden become addictive. The is very little of the screen door effect, and you can either use the Quest game library (and use the headset without being connected to a PC) or play games from the Rift store via USB C cable. The actual resolution of the screen is approximately DVD quality, so don't expect HD graphics, but the immersive nature more than makes up for it.

The Oculus has exceeded expectations especially the wireless airlink. The resolution is impressive as it’s a higher upgrade from previous one.One great feature is that you don’t have to compromise between the stand alone experience and the high end experience .Only down side is that you need a Facebook account to use the Oculus.

It has been a year since the Oculus Quest 2 hit the market with its amazing features and competitive pricing and even 12 months later, no company can come close too, and while some consumers are not particularly a fan of Oculus following their acquisition by facebook some years back its undeniable what the Quest 2 did for VR as a whole. In one year it became the top PCVR Headset on Steam's hardware survey, and perhaps most importantly, opened VR up to a much wider audience, gone are the days of spending $1,000 on some crappy 72hz flyscreen door panel that still requires a $5,000 computer minimum, the $299 Oculus Quest 2 offers a 1832x1920 per-eye LCD display with a refresh rate of 120hz with an FOV of about 90° this allows first-time VR users to jump into one of the highest quality consumer VR headsets on market, and allows users of the lackluster PSVR and oculus rift/rift S to get a nice upgrade.Things I LikePrice: its a great price for anyone especially considering it is still somehow one of the best consumer VR headsets you can buyStrap: ok ok dont leave yet, sure for VR enthusiasts the felt strap is utter garbage, however its allot more portable and approachable for new VR users, with my current quest 2 setup to pull it out of my bag and use it requires unzipping the largest compartment, pulling out the behemoth, twisting the adjustment strap on the back, putting it on my head then adjusting the strap more (which when tightening makes a fairly loud ratcheting noise) then flipping my MYJK headphones down, the felt strap and some airpods (yes bluetooth audio is supported by the quest 2), the included strap is also a lot more comfortable for laying in bed, or sitting in an airplane, also its allot more portable being a soft malleable felt, rather than rigid plasticControllers: The controllers on the quest 2 are probably the best VR controllers barring that of the valve index, the haptics are good enough, size is good, layout is too, the durability is amazing and the controller lasts forever, i have some rechargeable AA’s in them (tenavolts to be specific) and they haven't died in over a month of regular useThings I Don’t LikeOculus Link: It works by just sending the display from the PC to the headset, can crash a lot and sometimes wont even connect, i think some sort of hardware level switch from quest to “rift” mode would have been A LOT better and could even open the door to things like compressionless link via displayport to usb CPassthrough: oculus keep trying to push their “infinite office” agenda which whilst cool in theory, not really possible with grainy black and white cameras, surely just 2 front mounted colour ones used for passthrough alone would have fixed this problem, passthrough isn’t even usable to go and check something in the kitchen or get water or anything of the sort as it goes totally black if you get too far away from the playspace (notably if you unblock the proximity sensor it doesnt go black anymore?)

The technology side inside the Gen2 is brilliant and its crisp and clear but you can see all the places they have cut corners to get the price down.These are rather disappointing things i had found and wish i had know before i had bought this.Especially transitioning from the gen 1 to this,The stock head strap is practically worthless, it'll suffice until you buy a premium one, its not as adjustable or forgiving as the gen1 and is extremely uncomfortable on the head and neck for periods of playThe controllers while looking similar to the Gen1 have changed their shape and are uncomfortable and leave your hands aching after 15-30 mins of game time, were as you could play with the gen1 until the battery died and still could have kept going.you would probably be better off in getting the 64gb headset as you will have to factor in all the extras you will need to buy for this to make it comfortable to use.tldr  sacrifices to comfort and ergo were made in favour of lowing the price. you'll have to spend money to make comfortable

Waiting for Amazon to restock so I can request a replacement for my currently faulty unit.The extended battery strap stopped working after a week (no longer charges or provides power via its USB plug), which caused the data functionality of the headset to stop working as well.Unable to connect device to PC via USB- USB descriptor failed, device malfunctioned on multiple PC - headset requires replacement along with the headstrap.Lets hope the 2nd is better.

Well, I have to say the Oculus Quest 2 completely blew my mind.  I've had it for 2 and a half weeks and I'm still a bit stunned at how far my dreams of VR have come.By no means is it perfect.  It's not Ready Player One level.  But it is still pretty damn amazing and well worth the money.There are lots of crap VR apps and games, but the good ones are really awesome.  You won't be disappointed.

Great device, delivers what it promises straight out of the box for beginners. But that is just scratching the surface, the standard Quest 2 content for the standalone headset from the Oculus store is just the tip of the iceberg.Dig just a bit deeper and you can connect to your PC and play high fidelity PC games (with the right Rig) using a connect cable. Want more? with the right router at home you can have a wireless PC VR gaming experience using either the free Oculus software or using third party desktop app (Virtual Desktop).This on its own transforms your standalone VR headset into a fully featured PC VR headset capable of playing games previously available to much more expensive dedicated PC VR headset.You can then open up the world of full PC Oculus VR gaming and Steam VR content (think Lone Echo, or Half Life Alyx) wirelessly on this little gem of a device.But there is more ... for the brave who is willing to venture outside you can enter the world of SideQuest, opening another dimension in content, many free of charge to try.But that is still just the beginning, for the grand masters out there you can then venture into the world of Vorpx (a third party VR injection application which you can buy) which you can set up with your PC (takes a bit of tinkering) but when it gets going you then get access to play non VR 3D content in your VR Quest 2 device as if they were VR games!!!Try imagining playing Half Life 2, BioShock series, Halo or Titanfall 2 immersed into their environments as if they were VR games. You would still have to use a keyboard and mouse or a gamepad but the overall immersive experience is second to none.On top of all of that every few weeks Oculus delivers another round of software enhancements and upgrades with the most recent ones adding smooth presentation and targeting productivity.There is a long road ahead for VR, but the Quest 2 is an incredible leap. This one device can satisfy the beginners and grand masters at the same time.

When my son asked me to buy this I was not fussed. But the games on it a pretty fun and entertaining. The device is reasonably well made and we have had no issues with the system at all. I probably still prefer PC gaming but this is great fun for the whole family.

Best game ever! However if you have more than one device you can not share the games across, so you need to also purchase the games for each head set! Today I purchased 2 x $47 light saber games..disappointing the greed of Facebook technologies.

You charge it, then link it with your phone, then play anywhere you want (It does not need a computer to use it).It comes pre-installed with a few demos to get you started.There is a lot of free games in the store.I also bought a Link Cable and can connect the Quest 2 to my PC to play PC VR games as well.It works great and the clarity of the screen is awesome!The controls are super responsive and easy to get used to.

I have been playing it almost everyday since i bought it. Laser Beat, one of the best game for exercise. Enjoy the feeling of slice everything open and follow the music and beat.  Also the dance central game, i do not even need to go to the club to dance anymore. it is just like you are in the club dancing with a girl. Do not even mention the shooting game population one. it is just like you are in a shooting movie and you are the main character. Everything looks so real. At the start you might feel a bit dizzy in the head but you will get use to it pretty quick.Year of the toy. You can not miss it. Also now facebook own oculus now i believe i am going to socialize with my facebook friends on oculus very soon. Everyone got to have their virtual home and play ground then talk in the oculus instead of facebook messenger.

I have only tried to Oculus Rift S once before.The Oculus Quest 2 really is as advertised, faster processing and better graphics along with a wireless design truly do provide for a play anywhere experience.The head unit is light and comfortable, the adjustable eye pieces make clarity a certainty, the handles are also very light and ergonomically very comfortable and easy to use.  The head strap is comfortable and easy to adjust but if your like me you will end up ordering the solid head strap with adjustable knob so it’s more along the lines of the Rift models, I do find that the flexible straps allow the unit to move around a little on your head with sharp turns or direction changes.Clarity and quality of the Quest 2 is very obvious as son as you put it on, images are very clear and crisp, however some 360 3D videos you can immerse yourself in may seem blurry at times but that is more because of the recording quality rather than the Quest 2.I got the 256 G model to allow for extra storage in the unit, I have been frustrated in the past by not having enough storage space and having to delete games to I talk new ones, this time I’ve opted for the larger storage capacity to hopefully avoid this scenario, atleast until I fill it.The unit comes well packed in a cardboard and plastic lined box where all the pieces fit easily and comfortably, however for longevity I have also ordered the hard case.Two things to keep in mind;1 - you will need a FB account to be able to do anything with the Oculus Quest 2, signing in is a must or no play2 - you will also need a wifi connection, at first my Quest 2 would detect every wifi signal in my street except mine, I had to do a modem reset by holding the power button in for 5 seconds on my modem, once I did that my wifi was detected and I was off and playing.You also need to download the Oculus app from the App or Play store, this also provides a platform for you to cast to so your friends can watch and see what you see, this is also achievable on PC by logging in to the Oculus web site and selecting PC from the casting options in your Quest.Overall the Oculus Quest 2 provides a clear and immersive gaming experience with out limits or wires, I definately recommend the Quest 2 if your looking for this kind of gaming or movie experience.

I currently don't have an Oculus-ready computer so I use the headset on its own. The display is awesome and the controllers are really easy to use. I love the headset. However, it does lag a bit and can't necessarily run everything on its own and I'm told it runs a lot better when connected (via cable or airplay) to a computer. Glad I bought it but plan to upgrade my PC soon for full functionality.

Their is way too many people giving reviews that make no sense like wanting more songs in beat saber because it's a newer modelIf you're gonna buy something at least look into it first1 why would they add songs to a game they don't own2 just because you can play it in the quest dies not mean they own itAnd all the people complaining about needing a Facebook account breh research firstNow putting that asideIf you want a full vr experience with great visuals and great games literally buy it you'll love It :) <3
