I keep in HTC vive brand as my car in Ford family. Well I had vive, vive pro. Then I got vive pro2. What concerning the headset graphic is probably the best on market. Problem was shaking picture and sometime frozen in game. Returned through Amazon (very easy)Then I got full kit Pro 2 from Vive Canada. Same problem.This time I did not consider to return without trying to fix it. And : fix was simple, disconnected cable on head side and reconnected. It did wor for that session. But when after session I unplaged head from pc and tried again Igot the same problem. Anyway to make it short seems problem is not a cable itself. Just the connection between headset and cable I think. When I did the same disconnect /reconnect dancing it did work again. Then after sesion I did not unplug headset from pc and next session did work again fine.Coincidence? Maybe. I like vive pro2 and I recommend this product. Just letting you know what you may expect.

its not the worst vr headset like other comment explain but its not perfect. first the audio is not that good like a valve he need more bass because when you play its sound like a cane or like it was far away. but the clarity on this is wow and really i come from a quest 2 and the quality of the lentile to its better. not that worst but all is good for me but the only remaing for me its the audio its not trash but its like 7/10 and valve its 10/10.

Was hoping the negative reviews were over-exaggerated but uh, they're pretty on point.  I wanted to try this out coming from the Valve Index at a time when my cable has gone bad.  Waiting for a replacement, decided to order a backup headset and thought I'd try this out instead of getting a second Index.  But wow.Pros--It weighs less than the Index-Somewhat more comfortable than the Index-Can't really notice a screen door effectNegatives--The closest setting for the lenses is still too far, field of view seems compromised-hard to get everything in good focus, seems to have excessively more glare than the Index, outside a very narrow spot in the center everything else is just too blurred.  Hard to enjoy the sharper resolution.-display is too dim, can't find a way to brighten it-seems to only have 90 or 120 hz modes.  The Index has a 80 hz mode which is particularly useful for certain games.-Terrible audio-Didn't test mic but have heard that is terrible too-$300 more expensive than the Index headsetNot really sure what you're paying for here as an improvement over the Index, the experience is very sub par.  Stick with the Index.

Every VR headset has major flaws and shortcomings, but all things considered I believe the HTC Vive Pro 2 is the best consumer VR gaming headset there is. I upgraded to it from the Valve Index, I'd do it again but there are many things wrong with the Vive Pro 2 as well.Pros:- The fact that it's a SteamVR headset with outside-in tracking and Valve Index controller compatibility- The 4896 x 2448 combined resolution which not only looks far better than 2880 x 1600 screens, it enables you to play games more effectively. This was one of the two main reasons I upgraded to the Vive Pro 2.- Aftermarket addons - from new pads and cushions (which I need) to the HTC Vive Tracker 3.0 for full body tracking (be warned about unreliability and inconsistency with these devices though), Vive Wireless Adapter, Vive Facial Tracker, and hopefully the Droolon F2 soon. The other main reason I purchased this.- Mildly improved FOV compared to the outgoing model- Easily available replacement parts from authorized dealers unlike Valve- Fairly breathable design, doesn't make you sweat profusely. Big improvement over the Index here.Cons:- Poorly calibrated with too much brightness and too little gamma correction. Probably calibrated for 1.8 gamma, and because the overwhelming majority of VR ""games"" lack adjustments for this, I'm stuck with it. Valve Index appears calibrated for the proper 2.2 gamma.- Very expensive, especially considering it doesn't even come with eye tracking despite the fact that the Vive Pro Eye does, and considering it doesn't come with the wireless adapter which still hasn't been updated to support a larger resolution- Very narrow focal sweet spot- Screen uses out of date LCD technology with poor contrast which cannot deliver true blacks- FOV still lower than ideal- Inferior headphone solution compared to the Valve Index- Poor microphone quality- Cable sleeving quality isn't great, seems like it will undergo the same kinking and wear and tear that my Index did, for which the cable is damaged enough to occasionally lose video signal entirely after just 1 year of use. For $799 you'd expect quality sleeving.- Headset cable is prone to being accidentally disconnected from the Link Box very easily- Comfort issues - creates relatively small concentrated pressure points on your head that build discomfort over time- Comfort issues - creates relatively small concentrated pressure points on your head that build discomfort over time. Also, I can't get an ideal fit, which results in the headset being prone to moving around during intense gameplay in games such as Blade & Sorcery (thus losing the focal sweet spot).- Not a weakness of the headset, but HTC has yet to come up with a competitor to the Valve Index controller which themselves are far from perfectDespite all the flaws, this is still my most recommended VR headset for the clarity, addons, and because I only recommend SteamVR headsets due to Valve Index controller compatibility and SteamVR base stations which are as good as tracking gets right now. Also, despite all the flaws, I still consider VR gaming to be a must-have, and it is the way I'd want to play most of my favorite games if it were possible. A lower price could have resulted in a 4 star rating from me.

HTC Vive Pro 2 - The Best of a Bad Situation

The cable that runs from the headset to the PC seems to have some defects. I may have gotten just a bad cable but their customer service made me want to pull my hair out. And I am a streamer too, not that that should matter, but it made no difference to them in terms of wanting to keep a happy customer that was promoting this very headset until I ran into the cable issue and spoke to customer service. They just don't seem to care about backing up what they sell from defects in production or design. It's a shame too.

I am a long time user of the original Vive. I got irritated with the weird gradient lenses so opted for nice clear replacement lenses I found for $50 on the internet. They made the Vive a joy to use. I recently upgraded to the Pro 2 and feel like I took a step back. With all the complaints I’ve read over the years regarding the weird lenses, I find the same lens design in the Pro 2. The only difference is that they are a different shaped lens which says I can’t use the upgraded lenses from the Vive.It’s just an $800 disappointment that with all HTC knows about the poor lens design that they still push a bad idea forward. Nowwe wait for some crafty person to build replacements for the new style. Or maybe return it and move to another brand.

I purchased this as an upgrade for my original Vive System, primarily to play Fallout 4 and Skyrim. I've got about 100 hours into it.The Good:I'm very happy with the upgraded video. The screen door effect is barely noticeable and the game graphics look significantly better, even though I can't even use the full 4896x2448 resolution with my GTX 1080ti. I look forward to replacing my video card and seeing the full headset resolution.The headset is wider than the original, so it fits better and is more comfortable when wearing glasses.Adding the headset was easy, and only took about 15 minutes. Steam VR also support both headsets, so I can swap back and forth easily if I want to.The IPD adjustment process is a definite improvement over the original, and makes it much easier to adjust correctly, especially when used by multiple people.The Bad:My GTX 1080ti can only run the headset at 3672x1836 @ 90Hz.The headset isn't uncomfortable, but it's not as comfortable as the original Vive. I could wear the original headset all day and never notice. This one becomes uncomfortable after a few hours. This may actually be due to the headset being wider to accommodate glasses. When I don't wear them I have to wear it tighter than I'd like since the headset doesn't fit the shape of my head as well as the original headset. I knocked off half a star for this.The Audio from the built-in headphones is bad, and HTC should feel bad given the price. I had to do a ton of tweaking with the Windows Audio Equalizer attached to the sound device to get the audio to sound decent through the headphones. It's noticeably worse than the Original Vive's Deluxe Audio Strap. I knocked off a star for this.Although you can remove the headphones, the head strap is permanent, so you can't wear other over-ear headphones like you can with the original Vive - you'd have to wear earbuds or stick with the included headphones. I knocked off another half start for this.Overall:I did end up keeping the headset as the video upgrade was worth it to me, but I'm still looking for a better audio solution.

I'm a VR enthusiast, currently wielding 10 devices. With HTC, I started with the Vive, then Pro, and now Pro 2.Overall, noticeable improvements and beautiful visuals. Any VR hobby person, enthusiast, or professional will enjoy it and love the updates.My one gear that is being ground right now is that you can't adjust the optical brightness for the eye lenses. There's a lot of places in VR games that are just way too dark (Pavlov especially). I think this has already been addressed by the masses, and HTC will push down an update in the future to make this easy to adjust. Right now, the only option is getting all Matrix on the device and changing some coding yourself.Otherwise, great device.

I feel really disappointed and let down by this headset. It boasts Index quality and specs with even higher resolution displays. While the displays are very high resolution, the FOV is nowhere near the Index level. It's also worth mentioning the Quest 2 has the same FOV for only $299. The audio and microphone quality is laughable, sounding like a smartphone from 2009. I've heard flip phones with better sound quality, and compared to the Quest 2 the Vive Pro 2 gets blown out of the water. It's an overblown, over-advertised, and overrated Quest 2 for 3x the price. In fact, I would choose my Quest 2 over the Vive Pro 2 any day of the week. The headstart is uncomfortable, the face foam is uncomfortable, and it hurts to think I almost bought one of these over my Index. I'm glad I made the right decision. The Index doesn't have nearly high-resolution displays, but at least the Index isn't utter trash. I'm really disappointed with the Vive headsets 2020-2021. Nice work on getting beaten out by the 1st gen Index and Quest 2. I'm getting my $799 money back and believe me, 1 star is being nice about it.

I want to make this clear that this review is meant specifically for those who may be struggling with the same question that I had - is the Vive Pro 2 worth buying if you already own the Vive Pro?Just to give everyone a little background history, I am a hardcore virtual reality enthusiast. I have been using VR extensively since the launch of the original HTC Vive. Over the years I've been fortunate enough to try several different VR headsets, including the PSVR, Oculus Rift, Oculus (Meta) Quest 2, as well as the Valve Index. However, the Vive Pro has been my undisputed favorite ever since its release.So when I heard that the Vive Pro 2 was releasing last year, I was excited to say the least. When I read about the substantial (on paper) improvements in resolution, the wider 120 degree FOV and enhanced refresh rate - I immediately began to debate on which major organ I would sell to acquire this beauty.""WE HAVE TO SEE....WE HAVE TO KNOW..""Vive Pro owners, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but these are my observations after using the Pro 2 in comparison to the Pro:-You will immediately notice that the black levels are not nearly as deep, nor the contrast as vivid asthe Pro. So disappointing. Not as bad as the Valve Index, but it will be a night and day difference to people like me that are used to the awesome OLED panels on the Pro. The new LCD type screens utilized in the Pro 2 does a decent job, but it still looks like everything is a little foggy because the dark areas are washed out. Say goodbye to those wonderful deep blacks and the amazing contrast found on the Pro. I don't understand why they chose to do this, as to me this almost negates the other improvements to clarity. In brightly lit scenes, the Vive Pro 2 shines, but games like Elite Dangerous, where the majority of the scenes are dark, the original Pro absolutely annihilates the Pro 2 in these areas.-Clarity is a noticeable difference however, in terms of viewing or reading things from a distance. In games like Onward, or any games where sniping, for example, might be involved - this clarity proves very useful. However, I did not find any meaningful difference, though the difference on paper indicates otherwise. The improved clarity was noticeable, but once again, I did not feel that it meaningfully enhanced the experience.-I would say the same about the 120hz refresh rate and FOV improvements. While nice, they don't seem to make much of a meaningful difference in the experience. These are, of course, welcome and nice enhancements. But not enough, in my opinion, to justify viewing the Vive Pro as an actual, next generation Vive headset.Ultimately, what it came down to for me was the panel lighting differences. The washed out black is very difficult to accept coming from the deep blacks found on the OLED Vive Pro panels. For me, the washed out blacks is immersion breaking. And it always makes me feel like I'm seeing things through a slight fog.The difference is NIGHT and DAY. If you value the way the colors and contrast pop so beautifully on the Pro, you will most likely find it very difficult to upgrade to the Pro 2.Bottom line is, it's a great headset. But if you're a Pro owner, I do not consider it worth the upgrade. Especially if you enjoy dark games like Elite Dangerous. While it has its paper advantages, the panel lighting on the Pro 2 seems like a step backwards because of the noticeable hit in the deep blacks and eye-popping contrast of the Pro. And the experience is a marginal improvement as a consequence of this baffling design change to the lighting system.Pro still ROCKS guys. Pro 2 is heading back where it came from. That was just my experience with it!

I own both an Index and OG Vive.I purchased this wanting more than the Index was giving me.  I wanted the better resolution, better fov, and my Index was hurting my temples which I never suffered with my OG Vive.It was about the same as the Index for comfort and nowhere near as comfortable as my OG Vive.My OG Vive has the Premium Audio Strap upgrade and I was used to the on ear headphones.  After switching to the Index with it's off-ear speakers, that I thought I would hate, I really didn't like the on ear headphones of the Vive Pro 2.My PC is a running a 3080ti and Intel 12900k.  It has the horsepower to push the extra pixels that the Vive Pro 2 has compared to the Index.  With that said though, the image didn't actually look better.  Switching back and fourth to check if I was crazy was a Hassel and there just wasn't  noticeable difference in clarity.God rays were noticeably worseto my eyes.Increased horiztal fov didn't make the games feel more natural, on the contrary, the reduced vertical fov made it to where you noticeay see the upper and lower boundaries of the screen which was pretty immersion-breaking.Finally, I don't know how they went from the supple cord of the OG Vive, to the thicker, easier to tangle cord of the Index, to the water hose that is the Vive Pro 2 cord.If it was $300 less than the price of the Index and came with all the stuff the Index comes with - I would still prefer the Index.I was immensely disappointed in this HMD and incredibly thankful for Amazon's generous return policy since nobody in a 100 mile radius had one to try.If you're getting into VR, you have a powerhouse of a PC, some disposable income and you want the best tracking and image quality for the money in VR today... get an Index.  If not, a Meta Quest 2 will serve you well.

This is very similar to the Vive pro, if you have it. Just higher resolution. To be fair, the resolution is pretty awesome, whether the content you have is that detailed or not. There is NO screen door.Lenses seem like they could be improved, although to be fair they have less fresnel bands than before. (Also, I hope in future models they get to where the lenses can just ""pop out"" so people can experiment freely). None of the headsets are perfect, but I feel like this one is still particularly prone to focus issues and godrays. On the first day I thought it was bad, but after wearing it more and learning to feel exactly where the headset should be, and toying with the IPD and face pad and straps a lot, I realized it's not really that bad if you can just keep the headset placed just right.
