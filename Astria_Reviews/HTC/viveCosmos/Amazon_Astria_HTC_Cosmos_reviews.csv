So the htc vive cosmos elite. You are probably like me when I was buying this headset and wondering why would I buy this head if I can get a valve index for only $100 more?  Well for one the whole point with the cosmos is customization. The way how the head set was built was for multiple attachments to be on it and face plates that can feel like your on a whole new head set. What I mean and what I think vibe is trying to do is make something you will never need to change out but instead just spend like $200 for a new face plate and boom it’s like you just bought a new head set. Plus let’s not forget this headset has a better refresh rate , better shipping , and it can be wireless all unlike the valve index.So in short words I would recommend getting this headset because it could save you money farther down the future.If you are switching from an oculus headset or a mixed reality head set I guarantee you will have a whole new experience. Now also this depends on your pc but that’s for every head set now.So there you have it that’s my honest opinion on theHTC VIVE COSMOS ELITE

ok first let me just say vr is hand down amazing i didnt know that  vr was that amazing lol the best ok so second thing the price ok let me just say yea it is a bit high but u got to  understand the tech in the headset is hand down cutting edge and u got to think ur not just buy goggles its a gaming console like a pre build pc or a xbox or ps4 so the price in the long run is worth it for a better headset third thing  games  ok on steam there are some many cool games and then the best part there all cheaper then other game there some games for a 1 that are not very loing but they are so fun and there a ton of free games that are more playable then the one u pay for and they have amazing deals  and the 6 month vive subscription  has 1254 games for this headset alone  now from what i seen of this headset on steam and vive  this headset is compatible with all the games pretty much now fourth thing iv talk to a couple of friends that have played on other vr and they said mine runs the best and looked better then the other one but  FIVE STARS FOR THIS VR amazing  last two things when u buy this  seting up the sensors are the hardest part but all the good vr has the sensors  now to set them up on the wall is nice but i wish i would of spent the extra and got the stand for them and then that way u dont have to put hole in ur wall and u can move them around like i put them on my wall and i will not take them down at all inless i buy the stands they sell the stand on here for pretty cheap but they would be worth it all the work i did to set my up on the wall

I have had this for a few months now.I had used the original vive at a friends house.I picked this because of the price. I was a little nervous, as I heard the reviews for the cosmos were not that great. But with the base stations it works amazing. No regrets!

I'm rather surprised this worked on my system. My gaming PC is an MSI GL63-series laptop with a Geforce 1660 TI Mobile graphics card. Not exactly the Lambo of gaming laptops or graphics, but it handles well enough for every game I've put it up against.All the 'DisplayPort needed' talk made me wiggle too, but an MDP-to-DP adapter make it work perfectly. (Heck, it came with one in the packaging, too)Pros:So far, games work just fine on mediumish quality with little to no lag issues. I play Half Life: Alyx on Medium and it works very well, Beat Sabre give no trouble, and VRchat also operated quite well. The room-tracking actually impressed me, it was quite near 1:1 movement with maybe 2-15 ms delay at worst and that was because of the laptop most likely. It presented an appropriate sense of scale within applications, as well as ample crouch detection, which you need for some games behind cover!The button configuration works well enough for all apps since SteamVR is handling most of the input mappings to known VR systems I suppose. Sure, it doesn't have a hand strap like the Index... so I use the wrist straps and don't drop my controllers. I don't hand per-finger tracking, but I got grips, and the interfaces are fine with that. Sure, I popped extra for the room sensors, it made logical sense so my clumsy self won't bump into the TV or  couch.Cons:The cable can bunch up a bit after a few dozen turns around the room, I'll attest to that. Sort of wish the earphones would better press to my ears, but I can hear through them fine while they hover just a half-inch away from my ears. Wouldn't've minded a 3.5mm plug to auxiliary headphones. Mic works in VRchat clearly however.Maybe this is just me still finding my VR legs, but after a few hours of usage, I do notice a 'tactile disparity' with the real world the next day. It's gotten better, probably need to tune that side eye-spacing knob a little better. But that knob ain't great and I can't go below 60mm which might help some smaller folk.Sure I had to make a Vive account during setup but... at least it ain't hocking my personal information or locking my games to a Meta account like some VR solutions might be doing. I don't HAVE to use the Vive storefront; SteamVR interfaces with it just fine. In fact, it's what does the actual room setup.Summary:I mean, sure the Index would be baller, but some of us have more important things like... you know... rent or groceries or bills. Do you NEED a $1,000+ VR setup? ... I mean REALLY NEED it? Do you need a $1,000+ phone? I mean REALLY NEED it? Do you NEED a car with power windows or can you just use the hand crank to achieve the same outcome and save a couple hundred bucks?Moderation in all things; the middle option is oftentimes sufficient. The HTC Cosmos Elite is plenty sufficient for its intended use case scenarios.

Not Meta or cheap, not the Porche Index of VR, but rather right in the middle!

All of the technical specs are top shelf and works as advertised.  I picked up this and the Valve Index, the Index does have it beat on field of view, but the Vive's display is noticeably better in color and clarity .  The Vive controllers have amazing tracking, but they're heavy and starting to show their age and there is no comparison between them and the Index's controllers (you can use those on the Vive too). But honestly my only major issue is that it's stupid front heavy and your neck will be hurting after a few minutes of play. If you are younger or don't have ripped neck muscles like a body builder, you may want to look at the much lighter Mixed Reality or Oculus headsets.

I used this for like 3 months just past being able to return it and then it stopped working. First the earphones stopped functioning for no reason then the headset crapped out altogether, so I'm out 600 bucks for cheaply made crap that doesn't work. Nothing I do and no trouble shooting of any kind does anything. Stay away and buy a different product form a company that isn't a rip off.

For the price, I think the headset is simply okay. I do love the headphones and the flip up display, but nothing else really makes it stand out. The actual display itself is super high resolution, they aren't lying when they say the screen-door effect is virtually gone. Additionally, I feel like it heats up less than the original Vive.I did have an issue with a dead pixel in the peripheral. Although minor, I emailed customer support and rather than the typical one email per day, it was solved that day within five emails. They offered to fix it for free, and even paid for shipping. I was told that it would take a month, but I ended up with a new headset the next week.

So, as a first tried it on it was a pain to set my head with the ""sweet spot"" and any little small adjustment off from it resulted in God rays and blurred letters.Solution: I found small business products that used 3d printing molds of the HTC Vive Cosmos Elite and used the samsung vr lens. I swapped the current lenses and now the quality of playing majorly improved.Conclusion / considerationsGet the headset if you are willing to deal with these hiccups and do the mod yourself as I did.Or look elsewhere and find a headset that is right for you without modifications.

Bought two of them for my brother and I to use, and the setup could not of been more perfect. Not only can we use both of them in the same space, the tracking is amazing. 900 is a little steep, however worth it if you want to experience VR, and have something customizable in the future. The index headset is almost identical, and you could buy separate controllers for this system (in months because valve forgot how do produce products). I probably would of got the index if it was in stock, however I'll just customize it to make it better in the future.

With the Valve Index being in back order hell I decided to pull the trigger on the Vive Cosmos Elite and holy crap I am glad I did it is fantastic. I don't know what else to say other than it is absolutely worth it.

Love it. Use it religiously, just bare in mind setup may be frustrating and if you are just buying for Vrchat and exclusively. Get the quest 2. Cheaper, no setup really, you can still connect it to your computer and the vive is purely for the things you can't do anywhere else.

I have to say, the headset is a step down from the original vive, and its nice that you can swap face plates, but that's another cost. Only issue with this headset is the pupil distance, and a little sweet spot in the center that kinda bothers me, but not much.

I will have to see how it holds up in the long run but so far it has been absolutely great. So much so that I was actually confused why people hate so much on the vive in the first place. If you were thinking of getting an index anyways, I recommend just getting this for right now. The index isnt really available and you can easily upgrade by just buying knuckles and a headset in the future since this includes base stations. To me it is very much worth the price, I may even cancel my order of knuckles because I have loked the wands more than I thought I would.
