THE END OF THE FRACKING WORLD  

The award-winning action adventure, now on PC VR!

From the creators of the ground-breaking Phantom: Covert Ops, Fracked seamlessly collides relentless “run and cover” gunfights with free and fluid skiing and climbing, in trailblazing fashion. Uncompromised, audacious, and unashamedly stylish, Fracked grabs your VR headset by the motion controllers and delivers an ass kicking virtual reality game that has been made from the ground up for virtual reality platforms.

Stranded in a remote mountain facility, you play as a reluctant hero forced into a final stand between the planet and a legion of interdimensional enemies. Take aim and run head-first into explosive action as you shoot, ski, and climb your way across an extreme adventure. Alone, on the edge and really fracked off, humanity’s survival is in your hands.  

Playable on Valve Index, HTC Vive, Meta Rift S, and Meta Quest and Quest 2 via Oculus Link.

BE THE ACTION HERO 
Grab your gun, cock it, and take aim as a maverick war hero thrown back into the fight.  Experience innovative VR gunplay that ingeniously blends improvised run and gun combat with a 1:1 grabbable cover system.  Move freely around the battlefield to outflank, outsmart, and outgun an escalating threat with your arsenal of deadly, fully interactive weapons.  

FEEL THE ADVENTURE
Venture through a harsh and dangerous mountain locale by seamlessly transitioning between a host of first-person free movement methods. Physically lean into the bends on your skis to master the slopes at high speed.  Reach out and hold on for your life as you climb and zipline far above the ground or perform audacious base-jumps to elude your foes.  No rails. No limits. No mercy.  

SAVE THE PLANET  
The corporation dug too deep unleashing the ‘Fracked’ from the depths below. Across one day, take on an interdimensional army that combines hive mind mentality and gun-wielding supremacy - the perfect targets to unload round upon round into.  Fracked is in-your-face action with a cutting commentary on corporate greed and the climate change emergency. Save the day, to save the world.  

DESIGNED FOR VIRTUAL REALITY
Created from the ground up for VR devices, Fracked pulls the action-adventure genre to revolutionary new heights through intuitive 1:1 VR gameplay. Interactions, locomotion and gunfights seamlessly combine in a single, pioneering VR game.

AREA MAN LIVES. Or does he? If you could join a radio drama already in progress, talk to the characters and interact with the environments the story painted in your mind, you might find yourself in the world of the area man.

A quirky radio drama unfolds around you in VR while you do your best to keep the radio station humming along as its new DJ. You record commercials, interview callers and try your best to piece together how your actions inside the station impact your listening audience in scenarios so wild they can only live in your imagination.

If it all feels like too much, don’t worry, you’ll have your lonely producer, the resident skeptic, to guide you on your way, not to mention the vaguely British female voice inside your head.

When an unusual area man calls into the station asking for your help, you have to act fast. Will you trust the area man, or do your best to thwart his plans? Is there anything you can do to save the area man from himself?

ABOUT THIS GAME

Welcome to Myst: a starkly beautiful island, eerily tinged with mystery and shrouded in intrigue.

Journey to Myst Island and other stunning, long dormant locations - called “Ages”- and begin to unravel the mystery you have been thrust into. As you learn what happened on the island, you will find that you are playing a key role in an epic story whose ending has not yet been written. Explore deeper connections in these stunning and surreal Ages, uncover a story of ruthless family betrayal, and make choices that will affect both you, and the world of Myst itself.

Cyan, the indie studio that created the beloved classic, has reimagined Myst.

Built from the ground up to play in VR, Myst is teeming with new art, new sound, re-imagined interactions, and even optional puzzle randomization. Finally... the highly anticipated Myst VR experience has arrived!

Now you can explore the Ages of Myst in a new dimension!

BUILT FOR VR

Designed and built from the ground up in Unreal Engine, this newly-reimagined version of Myst includes fresh takes on the visuals in every area in the game.

Experiencing this modern edition of Myst will immerse you in the world in a way that has never been possible before.

The VR experience includes both Free Roam and Teleport modes, and supports Valve Index, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Rift S, and Quest via Oculus Link.

Additionally, Myst includes many “comfort level” features for both new and experienced VR users, including the option to enable smooth or snap turning, quick travel up stairs and ladders, vertical height quantization, and more!

NEW AND REQUESTED FEATURES

For the first time in Myst’s history, enjoy the game in many different languages through localized UI, including dialogue and gameplay-context subtitles.
- A variety of accessibility options to assist in gameplay.
- Tired of taking notes? Now you can take photo captures in-game to keep track of what you’ve encountered!
- A large number of graphics options to choose from, such as supersampling options and Ray Tracing to bring the best Myst experience out of the hardware you have.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Q: Which VR headsets do you support?
A: Please see our “About” section for the VR headsets we support.

Q: I bought Myst when it first came out in 1993. Can I get a free upgrade to this new version?
A: Thank you for your support over the years! We are not giving out free upgrades to previous purchasers of the original Myst. We put a lot of effort into making this new version of Myst and would appreciate your financial support again!

Q: How do I launch Myst in VR?
A: You may launch Myst in VR through the VR launch options given to you when you start the game through the store platform. If you are launching through a shortcut on your computer and not through a storefront, we recommend adding the following flags to a shortcut (without quotes): “-vr -d3d11”

Q: I want to play Myst, but am concerned about my computer not meeting the minimum requirements. What should I do?
A: If your machine does not meet the minimum requirements and you still want to try Myst out, we recommend enabling one of our supersampling options through the graphics settings menu to see if it alleviates performance concerns. Depending on the storefront you purchase Myst from, you may be able to qualify for a refund through the store (not through Cyan support) if Myst does not run well on your platform. Please review each store platform refund policy for details.

Q: Will Myst support [insert language here] one day?
A: Possibly! We’d love to hear from you through our support team about any languages you’d like for us to support.

Become the ultimate chef! Take control of a highly polished, realistic kitchen equipped with all kinds of utensils and stands. Unlock and master over 80 recipes or use dozens of lifelike ingredients to cook everything you like. A simulator spiced up with a dash of real-life physics!

Key Features:

    Career and Sandbox modes
    80+ recipes
    140+ lifelike ingredients
    Perks and skills to unlock
    Advanced cooking mechanics
    Realistic physics




Your kitchen’s got all the gear a chef might need. Griddles, cookers, gas stands, ovens and tons of utensils like pots, pans, plates, knives, spatulas and blenders! On top of that there are over 140 ingredients available in the pantry: meat and fish, fruit and veggies, dairy products and various liquids. There’s also a full set of spices and herbs for adding that extra flavour!



Lifelike cooking experience! All the ingredients respond to your actions by changing temperature, appearance and taste. Every time you’re slicing potatoes, flipping steaks or boiling a soup, there are some real-life physics applied to it. Once you learn the cooking mechanics and start serving dishes, you’ll see yourself becoming a better chef with every new plate on the checkout.



Career mode is a culinary journey zero-to-hero style and your task is to gain fame for you and your restaurant. You’ll start from the basics and progressively unlock new more complex dishes and start serving more customers as your fame and experience grow. Once you master the recipes and workflow, you’ll be able to unlock various perks and skills.



However, if you’re not interested in playing by the rules, you’re going to love the Sandbox mode. Access all the recipes and ingredients and prepare whatever you like without any pressure. You don’t even have to cook anything! Game physics gives you unlimited opportunities. Throw knives like darts, set up cutting boards like dominoes, set the whole kitchen on fire, blow up the oven and save the day using a fire extinguisher!

8718ad68-0dd9-47b0-aac1-10f4d809afe5,Into The Radius VR,"¥3,090","Description

Into the Radius is a single-player survival shooter developed exclusively for premium Virtual Reality headsets.

Players are sent stalking through the surreal post-apocalyptic Pechorsk Radius Zone where physics-based interaction, realistic weapon handling, and moody atmosphere will get your adrenaline pumping as you struggle to survive in an unforgiving dystopian environment.

Open-world exploration, climbing, stealth and a dynamic day/night cycle. This creepy immersive VR survival shooter is inspired by 'Roadside Picnic' (Пикник на обочине).


The Pechorsk Radius
In 1987 the 'Pechorsk Event' changed everything for the quiet Soviet mining town. Locals described the event as a short earthquake, which caused clouds of dust to rise into the sky, reducing visibility to almost nothing. After the dust settled, they stated seeing a huge dark-red orb in the sky, with black ash floating around the area.

By 2002, The United Nations Pechorsk Special Committee (UNPSC) still administers the exclusion zone around the Pechorsk Radius, and no one is allowed to enter aside from the UNPSC specialists. Inside, it has been almost completely abandoned and stands as an isolated and blighted territory. Rumors, conspiracies, and legends continue to emerge - alluding to wondrous artifacts, deadly anomalies and bizarre entities that inhabit the once quiet mining region.


Explore
There are miles and miles of forests, swamps and crumbling industrial ruins for you to explore however you want.
But be careful: the Radius is filled with strange, lethal anomalies and hostile forces that threaten anyone foolish or daring enough to risk their lives.
Orienteer with your realistic map, plan your mission route, climb over obstacles, scout out shelters, uncover loot caches, and try not to get killed. At least not too often.

Realistic Weapons
Featuring classic Soviet firearms like the AKM Kalashnikov, PM Pistolet Makarova, SKS Carbine, and much more to come. Realistic interaction, manual magazine loading with different ammo types and weapon attachments.

Be sure to switch off the safety before you start firing! Realistic bullet physics cause ricochets, and bullets can penetrate different kinds of materials.

Take care of your weapons – if they take damage or their condition deteriorates, they will begin to jam.

Survival
Your only means of survival is to stalk around with your detector, hunt for artifacts and complete missions assigned to you by the UNPSC.

Stealth, silence, and preparation are your best friends in the Radius Zone. Understand how to navigate the terrain, move slowly, take cover, crouch, sneak, and beware of the threats around you!

Pack the right gear for your journey and plan ahead. Use the realistic day / night cycle to your advantage - scavenge for loot and scout during the day, sneak around quietly and evade your enemies under the cover of night.

Traverse an ancient city with detailed environments and randomly generated dungeons, discover fierce weapons with unique properties, upgrade your gear, level up your skills and engage in visceral combat with completely unrestricted VR movement and combat.

* An RPG made for VR

Why Early Access?
“We are planning to expand the world of EVERSLAUGHT and increase the scale significantly over the Early Access period. Also we are taking the time to fully optimize for VR playability & feel, building new mechanics from the ground up. Our goal is to take Action RPGs to the next level in VR, and this is why we have decided to include other fans of the genre and let you participate in the process. Early Access just made sense to us, considering all this.”
Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?
“We are planning to reach the 1.0 version of our game towards the end of 2022. That's definitely not set in stone though, since we already have a huge backlog of ideas that will allow us to further iterate on the project beyond that date. Our goal is to continuously expand on the game with a multitude of features and content updates, which will be heavily influenced by the feedback from our community.”
How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?
“We want to expand on EVERSLAUGHT's RPG elements, Lore and world building. While we do that, we will also focus on polishing the game mechanics more and more throughout the Early Access period. While we are planning to have a heavily randomized structure (similar to other ""loot dungeon crawlers""), we also want to have linear components in between to expand on the world and lore around it.”
What is the current state of the Early Access version?
“The core gameplay loop that we've planned is already in there: A linear section, randomly generated dungeons, random loot drops, unique enemy behaviours, enemy spawning systems for big fights, player progression & skill points, purchaseable player perks, rare weapon properties, melee fighting, grappling hook, ranged weaponry, VR-optimized gameplay mechanics.”
Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?
“The game will be released to Early Access at a discounted price. As the content and feature updates ramp up (as well as our production costs), the game price will be gradually increased.”
How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?
“We have a dedicated Discord channel for our community to participate in, at discord.gg/everslaught. We have an open feedback process through which the community can submit feedback and bug reports for us to improve the game.”

It's a classic premise - a massive subterranean scientific facility full of mysteries, with aliens bursting in from alternate universes to wreak havoc. The twist? You're one of those aliens. But you're not here to wreak havoc (collateral damage disregarded), you're just trying to get home. A difficult endeavor, as it turns out this facility is more than prepared to deal with extraterrestrial threats.

Explore the sprawling underground facilities of Planck Interdimensional's Quantum Reactor, filled with dark secrets, adorable drones, and parallel universes. You find yourself in the bowels of this machine after being whisked away from your home, and, armed with only the tools you can find, you must make your way to the surface, and the truth.

Face the challenge of escaping the depths of the Quantum Reactor.

Reject humanity.

Run, climb, and jump in VR using a unique locomotion method that only needs the movement of your hands and arms. No buttons, no sticks, no teleportation. Push off of surfaces to jump and squeeze them with both hands to climb. The game mode is simple tag, for up to 3 players, or infection mode, with 4 or more. Run from the infected gorillas, or outmaneuver the survivors to catch them. Parkour up trees and cliff faces to evade and chase people down. Hang out in a virtual, low-fi jungle with randos or group up in a private room with friends to hang out and play. The stakes are low, so feel free to just chat or make up your own games. The movement is easy to learn, and hard to master.

Become gorilla.

e4fa9753-c234-41d9-9e8d-75134bcc5d0b,Sairento VR Lite,"¥1,000","Description

Experience the thrill of being a cyber ninja in VR. Wall runs, power slides, back flips, triple jumps, katanas, guns, shurikens, kunais, throwing glaives, arrows and more. Be the super bad ass you've always wanted to be in Sairento VR!

Since its launch, Sairento VR has been gaining fans worldwide with its unique locomotion system. It is the one game in VR that allows you to experience the iconic ""bullet-time"" scenes from The Matrix, blended with the slow-motion mayhem of the Max Payne game series, all while looking and feeling as badass as the Bride from Kill Bill. 

Sairento VR was designed to be easy to pick up, but tough to master. The more time you spend with Sairento VR, the better you will perform the moves in the game and the more you will be rewarded with the unparalleled feeling of being the action hero of a big budget move production. 

Although Sairento VR Lite is a 'slimmer' version of the hit cyber ninja game Sairento VR, it is still an awesome experience because you will still be able to leap 15 feet into the air, slow time down while you blast away at an enemy before landing to deliver a lethal strike with your katana on another. It is the same badassery you get in the full version - just with less levels, less weapons and without the multiplayer, endless and campaign modes.

And if you decide you love it, then consider buying the full game!

******

Note - Sairento VR Lite is a modified version of Sairento VR. The differences are described below.

The full game includes the following :

- Campaign mode (not in Lite)
- Endless modes (not in Lite)
- Cooperative and PVP modes (not in Lite)
- 14 different levels (5 in Lite)
- 16 different weapons (3 in Lite)
- Daily rewards (not in Lite)
- Challenges
- No level cap (Max level 5 in Lite)
(also playable on Oculus Rift)

d4c9907a-8e53-4605-830d-003916f6bd54,STRIDE,"¥2,050","Description

STRIDE will be released in two phases:

The first phase will be STRIDE Arcade and will consist of three modes, each released separately and in short succession. These are:

-Endless mode. Infinite level generation provides unlimited challenging terrain.

-Arena mode. A spacious varied-terrain arena with waves of enemies. Perfect for practicing tricks and refining your shooting skills. (Coming soon)

-Time Chase. Test your parkour-at-speed skills in a race against the clock (Coming soon)

The second phase of the release will be the complete story version of the game. We are working on this parallel with the Arcade Modes and will announce the official release date as soon as it’s confirmed.

Why Early Access?
“We would like to present STRIDE’s parkour movement mechanics to the community. We hope to receive feedback on how to improve the mechanics as we continue development at this still relatively early stage.”
Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?
“We plan to be in Early Access until all three arcade modes have been released. This is likely to be towards the end of 2020. Each additional mode will likely integrate mechanics and other upgrades based on feedback from the community.”
How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?
“The early access version of the game is a series of arcade modes. These modes are released progressively as follows:

1. Endless Mode: Infinite level generation provides unlimited challenging terrain.
2. Speed mode: Test your parkour-at-speed skills in a race against the clock
3. Arena mode: A spacious varied-terrain arena with waves of enemies. Perfect for practicing tricks and refining your shooting skills.

NOTE: Paying for one mode entitles buyers to all three modes (as they are released)
The full version of the game will feature an immersive storyline (this is separate from and in addition to the three arcade modes). The player will take on the role of a hero who must advance through progressively challenging missions and overcome increasingly powerful enemies to meet a satisfying conclusion. Gameplay and movement mechanics will also have been perfected for the final release based on feedback and iterations throughout the Early Access period.”
What is the current state of the Early Access version?
“In the first early-access release, STRIDE will consist of one arcade mode called “Endless Mode” which features endless level generation. In this mode, players will be able to try out all the mechanics of parkour such as jumping, climbing, wall-running, sliding, ziplining and hooking.
Our aim is to convey a real sense of height, danger, and dynamic movement as players navigate through the realistic environment of city rooftops. We set ourselves the task of realizing the real sensations of parkour from the comfort of your virtual reality headset.”
Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?
“We plan to release arcade modes at a single price. At initial release, the game will include only one of the three arcade modes. The other two arcade modes will be included for free in subsequent updates. We will exit Early Access with the release of the story mode as an update, after which its cost will increase. For those who purchase the games in early access, the story mode will be made available for free.”
How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?
“We are always glad to hear feedback from the community. We do our best to implement your ideas and address your concerns. We are present on all social networks, so please drop us a line!""

Lead your viking ship to victory in this VR rhythm game! Pound your drums to the sound of epic music, from celtic rock to viking power metal, and set sail against your rivals in multiplayer mode. Will you outrace them all and carve your name on top of the leaderboard?

Are you ready to rock? Ragnarock is a solo/multiplayer VR rhythm game in which you play a viking captain competing in a ship race. With your two hammers, crush the incoming runes in sync with epic viking music. Keep hitting the runes perfectly to accumulate combo energy in your hammers, and you will be able to activate a speed boost!

- Viking music: 
The tracklist is curated with love and care and will be regularly updated. Unleash the drummer in you and play to the epic rock and metal tracks of Alestorm, Gloryhammer, Wind Rose and many more. All have a festive viking/celtic/pirate style, which will make you feel the viking power in you!

- Simple gameplay: 
Following the tradition of arcade games, Ragnarock is easy to play, hard to master. To move forward, only your sense of rhythm matters. However, to win the race, you will have to train and use your skills wisely. Multiple difficulty settings will help you improve over time. Only the most experienced players will be able to collect all gold medals, beat the high scores and sign their name on the leaderboard!

- Multiplayer mode: 
The multiplayer PvP mode brings real-time competition against your friends or other people. Start a public or private game (up to 6 players) and beat them all to finish in first place! In solo, you can also race against a ghost ship (representing your best score) to add some competition.

- Mythological environments: 
Ragnarock transports you to the land of the vikings in a stylized environment inspired by nordic mythology.

The universe renews, refreshes and repeats, infinitely folding in on itself. I am made of its energy. My past and future selves are always with me. We work together to generate the infinite cycle of creation and destruction. I exist within and without time, I am inevitable, I am eternal. Time and gravity are my tools to manipulate the world. I don't recognize this world, but I know I have been here before. 

Transpose is a dreamlike VR puzzle game set in a universe where time and gravity are used as tools to manipulate the world.

Time and Gravity 
Set in a mesmerizingly surreal world, Transpose allows players to control time and gravity. Rotate the environment around you to walk on walls and ceilings, experience perspective shifts and multifaceted puzzles in ways only possible in VR.

Cosmodread is a VR survival horror roguelike about escaping a dying spaceship filled with nightmares.

Stranded in a hostile universe, you must explore, survive, and find your way back to the safety of Earth. Cosmodread features a rich, tense and immersive atmosphere that will make you forget about the world outside the headset.

EXPLORE
Search for resources and find a way home. Every run will have you play in a new procedurally generated layout, with random positions for rooms, corridors, items and hazards, and different emergent situations. You’ll never quite know what’s behind the next door.

SURVIVE
Use your own hands to interact with the environment. Open doors, drawers and lockers and rummage through their contents. Collect basic resources, and craft weapons and equipment to deal with both enemies and hazards.

FIGHT
Crouch behind cover and shoot at enemies with your crossbow, or set a trap for them to walk into. But remember: ammo is scarce! Sometimes it’s better to just grab an object off a shelf and throw it away to distract the creature sniffing after you.

but you must take care of the heresy slowly corrupting your people and converting them to the false god.

You are the all mighty, but humans are the source of your power.

|| Reviews ||

""OhShape is just as much a game of mental prowess as it is physical endurance. Focus on your head hole and let the rest of the information wash over your, you'll need to pick up the details subconsciously through your peripheral vision if you want to keep up. (...) It's a really rewarding grind, and a crazy good work out"".- The Gamer

""OhShape is easy to jump into with little rhythm and VR game experience. Since first playing it, they added an update to include a Tutorial. Doesn’t matter if you’re new or a dance machine – play this first. It’ll show you how to line up your dance shadow and pose. Poses range from single arms, to cross arms, to dabbing, lunges, squats, plus other choreography."".  -AR Post.

Swordsman is a story-driven, physics-based medieval combat game designed for virtual reality. 
Experience combat where everything is physics-based, from weapons to bodies.

In the world of Swordsman, the Jötunn travels to Earth in an attempt to enslave all of humanity. He has recruited captains from all over the world, giving them godly weapons with which to command powerful armies. He wields seemingly infinite power: Hellfire.

The game features Knights, Vikings, Mongols, Samurai, epic boss fights and powerful boss weapons, player progression and customization, a Blacksmith, Armorer and Skill Master to help you build a character suited to your playstyle and lots of items to buy and unlock, all in effort to stop the Jötunn before it's too late.

Fight in six different thematic environments against four different cultures and five different bosses wielding 24 weapons and shields, 13 armors for customization and eight stats and skills to upgrade. Use Telekinesis to force-grab weapons, Chronokinesis to manipulate time, and various stats to improve strength, speed, vitality and more. The items you choose to wield, wear  or upgrade will affect how the game feels, allowing you to develop an interesting character with different strengths and weaknesses. Upgrade your strength stat to carry weapons with more ease. Upgrade your agility stat to improve your speed whilst wearing heavy armor. Don't care for heavy armor? Strap on the Samurai armor set and weave your way through enemies at full speed.

Swordsman also features gameplay modifiers. These will let you change how the core game works in fun and interesting ways. Hardcore enemies, invisible enemies (floating swords), enemies that only take damage when you hit marked body parts and many more. 

Slash your way through medieval Earth and become the ultimate Swordsman in VR.

Should I join?
Is there anything more epic than slaying hordes of orcs with a bow in Virtual Reality? When nothing comes to your mind, then you probably should try this. If you thought: ""Of course, slaying them with my friends online in co-op mode!"", then this is the matter of destiny.

Become an elven assassin.
Take a bow and kill hundreds of orcs of different types that want to get into the elven town and destroy it. As an elven assassin, you will make spectacular shots like long distant headshots or you will send lethal arrows through the windows. All this to conquer global leaderboards of other elven assassins.

Piece of cake then?
Not really. This is real orcs assault. The Orcs are running fast making the game more competitive. They break into houses to hide from your arrows, and when they got furious their massive axe is thrown to splash you head into pieces.

Assassin United.
Two, Three or Four assassin may unite to defend the town. Use wisely the four available archery spots to survive as long as possible. You can choose one of the public servers, that asks for your support or decide to defend the castle only with the brothers you know on the private server.

PvP Deathmatch.
For those who would rather test themselves against other players online in a competitive mode, the PvP Deathmatch was introduced. But be careful with this one as there are some extremely skilled archers waiting for a challenge there.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬   E A R L Y    A C C E S S  ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

Hard Bullet is an action adventure VR game with realistic physics, lots of guns, gory body damage, slow motion abilities and cinematic environment destructions.

• Fast-paced Action: inspired by genre-defining classic Hong Kong action movies.
• Destructions and Physics: using the best solutions to bring realistic physic destructions, object and environment hand interactions.
• Slow Motion and Tricks: control time like famous PC and console blockbusters — perform long jumps in slow motion and kick enemies with your overpowered fists.
• Weapons: Expect variety of famous pistols, submachine guns and shotguns, you'll get some sweet rifles and machine guns as well.
• Enemy Gore Body Damage: Accurate full body IK systems. You can turn on real gore mayhem with body dismembering, bullet holes and blood fountains if you are ready.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ A R M O R Y ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

Large gun collection and handy blunt weapons. Every gun has unique sounds, damage and fire modes.

Meet and unlock dozens of iconic firearms to take with you into battle:
• 8 Automatic Pistols like Gretta, Sweet17, Greening and more!
• 12 Submachine Guns — take one in each hand and never stop bursting!
• 8 mighty Shotguns to shred enemies in parts: Moss50 or Ram870? Why choose when you can take both?
• 2 Rifles. Ivan47 or Mark16 — best of east and west for you.
Notice, these guns do not copy the exact design of real prototypes, but we tried to stick to reality as close as we could. 

But what about close combat?
While the bladed weapons are still in work, we have some cool stuff to show.
You can use any game object to fight enemies! Be creative!

Two Gunplay modes: Arcade and Tactical

We prepared two different gun modes so you can feel yourself a powerfull action movie hero as well as a tactical modern fighter:
•  Tactical Mode brings everything you like in realistic shooters: hand reloads, cool mag-hits-mag tricks and all the tricks you can found. Use both hands to hold handguard weapons to reduce recoil, be fast and sharp to get out alive.
•  Arcade Mode is the one we wanted to bring to VR. Your guns do autoreloads when you bring them closer to your wais, so both your hands can have one. Do crazy dual wielding jumps, use two shotguns at a time or show your gun fu skills with dual pistols.

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ E N E M I E S ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬

Gore and Dismemberment
Compex dismemberment and realistic bullet damage with blood fountains all around — can it be more fun?

Oh boy it can.

Use different gory instruments like meat grinders, sharp spikes, killer stackers and electricity powers to bring world of pain. They deserve this.

Ragdolls and AI
• All enemieas have several weapons on them to use.
• Doing special attack if player gets too close.
• Looking for cover when are low on health. Looking for guns or batons when lost theirs.
• Commenting the situation around.
• AI is not perfect and we are working on it every day.

Physics fun you can do:
• Hit with any object you can find. Gun butts are good too.

Have you ever wondered what it's like to be a real thief? Now you can see for yourself in Thief Simulator VR! Steal in free roam sandbox neighborhoods. Observe your target and gather information that will help you with the burglary. Take the challenge and rob the best secured houses. Buy some hi-tech burglar equipment and learn new thief tricks. Sell stolen goods to the passers. Do anything that a real thief does. And… don’t get caught!


A good thief always observes his target. What's inside? Who lives there? What's your target day schedule? Find out when the house is empty and does it have nosy neighbours. Choose from lots of possible approaches to prepare the best plan. Many modern devices available in Thief Simulator might come in handy with gathering intel about your target and it's neighbourhood.


The faster, the better. Find and steal as many valuables as possible in the shortest time possible. Remember that infinite backpacks don't exist. When it's about time you have to maintain cold blood. In every house you'll find tons of useless stuff, which can really slow you down. If you're not sure that you can take some serious money for it, maybe a good idea would be to leave it behind and save space for some expensive goods. If you fill your backpack with worthless items, you may have to waste your time to throw stuff out just to make space for other things. Be careful, cause some things can draw police attention to you!


A real, experienced thief can spot places where there's most probability of finding some valuables on the fly. Use the flashlight at night to highlight all the valuables in sight and places where you can expect them to be.


Turn off the GPS trackers, disconnect all the devices from the internet and erase serial numbers. Disassemble a stolen car and sell parts on the internet. Prepare phones and tablets before selling in a pawn shop by removing their security.


Look around for any useful items. They will save you some time on lockpicking or hacking. Key near a window or purchase receipts in trash bins. All those things can make life of an aspiring thief so much easier and reduce your burglary time even by a half. Of course many of them are just useless trash... Or maybe they aren't?


Be careful! In some houses you can meet unexpected guests. If they catch you in the act, they will call the police. In this case hide and wait till they stop looking for you or you can always leave the loot and run away as fast as possible.

Pixel Ripped is back with a brand new nostalgia-fueled virtual reality game-within-a-game, this time in the year 1995! To restore balance to multiple dimensions, our videogame hero Dot recruits the help of the best gamer from 1995, an unassuming 9-year-old boy named David. Join this unlikely duo through challenging throwbacks to all your favorite classics from the late 16-bit and early 32-bit era of games inside a virtual reality world, all while maneuvering through the real life challenges of a kid who just wants to save the world by doing what he does best - playing videogames.

The game evokes a genuine nostalgic feeling, such as the adrenaline of playing games without getting caught after your mom told you to go to bed, or the thrill of finding that brand new game at the store. Play through homages to the best video games and genres from the 1990s, including action RPGs, brawlers, 2D platformers, space shooters and racing games. You have to do all that and more while you dodge the ire of your parents through multiple environments - including your living room, bedroom, the local video rental store, the arcade at the pier, and more. With 6 fully original and highly differentiated levels, where each one feels like an entire new game, Pixel Ripped 1995 is an incredible journey for both VR and retro gamers.

Ultimate Challenge Update

Pixel Ripped 1989 is a wacky multi-dimensional homage to the early days of gaming. The player embarks on a journey into the screen of a classic videogame and beyond.

Our passion for flying and the incredible experience of virtual reality are together in this great flight simulator! Learn to fly the TG66, an instruction and rescue helicopter in the mountains! Test your skills in controlling this machine in the most adverse conditions that nature presents us with. Helicopter Simulator VR 2021 brings 6 different fuselage configurations, a super detailed mountain scenery, with power plants, cable cars, power lines, hospitals, airports and much more! You will be impressed!

Learn, hone and master all the instruments and controls of a real helicopter! Follow the tutorials to turn the aircraft on and off, learn to use ropes and flares and apply your knowledge in missions based on real situations!

We created a helicopter based on real life. The sequence of turning on and handling must be strictly followed, with the risk of the helicopter gets stuck. But that's ok! That's why there are flight simulators to train your skills and get better and more proficient.

VR Cockpit and Extreme Realism
• All cockpit instruments work like they do in real life. Pay attention to your RPM and altitude at all times. You will find that flying a helicopter is much cooler and more challenging than you ever imagined.
• Fly too high, close to the operational ceiling or if you fly too close to the mountain walls you will notice changes in the aircraft's behavior. We care a lot about physics and everything a real-life pilot faces when performing mountain rescues.

Test and Hone Your Flight
• Weather – choose the weather conditions of your flight and challenge yourself even more by flying in storms and with little visibility.
• Aerodynamic Control and Ambient Perception - Flying at high altitudes and sweeping over the mountains will separate good pilots from apprentices. Rescues will be needed in the mountains and these skills are imperative!

Physics, the ""state-of-the-art""
• All helicopter control surfaces interact and are impacted by physics throughout the flight, bringing unprecedented flight reality! And using your virtual reality headset you will be immersed in a truly incredible experience!
• Weather, wind, altitude, speed and attitude of the helicopter will be felt. During missions, you will have to transport passengers, cargo and even trees using the external rope attached to your skis. Complete control of the helicopter will be very important!

Helicopter Simulator VR 2021*: If you want to have the best virtual reality experience of your life, it's here!

MAIN FEATURES
• Incredibly Detailed cockpit and models.
• Interact with 100% of flight instruments
- HOTAS, Gamepad, and + 1000 joysticks support.
- Easy and Expert controls. Made for everyone to play!
• Miles and miles of snow mountains, lakes, and wonderful landscapes.

• 14 advanced missions.
• Free flight and hours of aircraft piloting and learning.
• Living scenery, with cable cars, animals, and characters, as VIPs and employees on an oil rig and power plant.

Having long studied ancient Egyptian lore, you’re intrigued by recent reports of structures appearing in the Sahara Desert via new satellite imaging. The locations seem familiar to you on a map, as they correspond to burial sites of the elite Mejai, powerful warriors blessed with unnaturally long life by the high-priest Akar for the purpose of protecting the pharaoh. However, a blessing in life may be a curse in death… Ancient texts mention these warriors turned mad exceeding the bounds of mortality, bringing death and ruin to those around them. To stop them, legend tells of a group of brave Egyptians who lured each Mejai into separate tombs using invaluable relics, and then trapped them inside forever…

While this story may be a myth, you feel obligated to investigate, as the historical and monetary value of such a discovery would be beyond your wildest dreams. But be careful - if the legends are true, the Mejai have been sulking in rage all this time, yearning to wreak havoc on humanity as revenge for their imprisonment.

Gather your team of archaeologists and treasure hunters in this co-op thriller and discover the truth behind the legend. Play solo, with a group of friends, or find a public match online.


Take advantage of every tool at your disposal to navigate through ancient Egyptian ruins and survive the perils within. Alternatively, you can choose to provide intel to your teammates from outside the ruins in the safety of your excavation tent, using such tools as the radar system or motion sensor array to detect activity.

The main objective of the game is to search the ruins for each relic that was used to lure and trap the cursed Mejai many millennia ago. As you traverse the tombs, observe the phenomena around you to identify the Mejai while it's in its spiritual form before it assumes its physical form. Each playthrough, or round, will include one main relic to collect, as well as numerous archaeological tasks to complete and loot to collect in the form of gold, lore, and rare artifacts.

You and your team will have to decide how to accomplish these challenges.

Split up to cover more ground, or stay as a group to increase survivability.
Get in and out, or let curiosity get the better of you and explore every path to reveal the mysteries and lore of the Mejai.
Give in to greed and linger in the darkness to find treasure of unparalleled worth, or be content leaving with your life.

Be weary of whatever choice you make, as you and your team will soon discover you are not alone beneath the cursed sands…

Procedurally generated levels and randomized AI to ensure no two playthroughs are ever the same and that you'll always have a unique experience
Encounter several different Mejai, each with unique characteristics and abilities
Utilize your choice of archaeological equipment to increase your chances of survival

PC & VR Crossplay Supported
Play in PC mode, or play in VR mode for increased immersion with haptic feedback.
Positional Voice Chat
Strategize with your teammates with in-game voice chat.
Loot Collection System
Use your collected loot to upgrade your equipment and purchase more powerful tools.
Embrace the Curse of the Mejai
When you die, you will have the option to return as a servant of the Mejai. Will you hold on to a semblance of your former self and help the remaining survivors, or demonstrate loyalty to your new master?

Detached is a space exploration VR game that demands tactics and skill to survive. Strap yourself in for hardcore gameplay uniquely designed for VR headsets.

Trapped in an abandoned space station, you must race against borrowed time to find your crew before your oxygen supply runs out. As you solve puzzles to open airlocks, locate power cores and disable transmitters, something tells you that you won’t be alone when you finally escape into the universe’s deep infinity.

Core Features

Go Hardcore – Experience 360-degree freedom of movement, rotation and acceleration in a sandbox environment built for VR headsets.
It’s Getting So Atmospheric – Discover the wide blue yonder inspired by the sublimity of Gravity with an accompanying fully orchestrated score composed by Mikołaj Stroiński (The Witcher 3, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter).
Blast, Splinter and Charge – Employ Shield, Boost and EMP Rockets skills in both single-player and multiplayer modes. Hit targets with lock-on missiles built into your suit. Master weapon cool down times before your opponent gets the upper hand. Gain temporary immunity with the shield skill. Exploit boosting tunnels to gain a speed advantage.
Astronautic Drills – Get to grips with your spacesuit’s controls in a zero-G environment through a dynamic tutorial before venturing into outer space. FPS-style steering will introduce newbies and those sensitive to VR playing to the hardcore VR experience.
Blink and You’ll Miss It – Challenge a friend to Detached’s nail-biting PvP mode and then spend time getting acquainted with the infinite universe in single-player mode.

Warning

This is an extreme VR experience that simulates sudden and dramatic acceleration, freefalling, twisting and rolling. Even with the 90 FPS frame rate, it is not for VR-sensitive players.


Exploration. Rivalry. Survival.
These are the tenets of deep space society. Detached drops you at the edge of a universe destroyed by human misrule and extortion. Thanks to years of warfare and greed, the human colonies in deep space are no more. The great factions have crumbled; the corrupt corporations have dissolved.
Most people adhere to the last remaining code of humanity: no killing. But in the lonely expanse of space where resources are low, many are willing to bend the rules to survive.

“Detached will give you tons of freedom in how you play, and the gaming sensation is intense,” says Łukasz Hacura, Creative Director of Anshar Studios, “players of our Early Access release told us exactly what we needed to know to make the game absolutely electrifying for virtual reality headset users.”

Detached isn't just a game; it’s an experience. Unlike many games where VR is a mere expansion, VR is the primary asset of Detached. To complete the game, you must master the controls of your EVA spacesuit and develop your ability to move in a realistic zero-G environment.

Put your skills to the test in both single-player and multiplayer modes. Multiplayer pits you against your friends in an entirely new take on capture the flag. Race against each other to gather the necessary skills and complete your mission. Every second is precious, and every choice you make can mark the difference between life and death.

Single-player mode makes full use of the VR headset, giving you the chance to interact with the tranquil expanse of space. Beta players have lauded Detached’s sandbox environment that encourages players to enjoy the types of experiences normally only felt by astronauts.

TOKYO CHRONOS is the VR game that has multiple-choice decision points as well as more than one ending. It has a long story you’ve never experienced before with VR.
The game takes place in Shibuya, Tokyo, which has only eight people, including you, the protagonist, Kyosuke Sakurai. Why are they there? How can they break out of the enclosed world? More than that, what is the reason causing this strange phenomenon?
Can Kyosuke solve the mystery and get out of the silent Shibuya?

-Features-
● Drastic advancement of visual novel games with VR
The total gameplay time reaches to 15 hours. The story has multiple-choice decision points as well as more than one ending.

●Moving scenario making your HMD wet with your tears
One review says, “I’ve purchased several games at the Oculus store, and none of them satisfied me. But TOKYO CHRONOS is no comparison. At first, you’re surprised at the beautiful images. But the deep story surpasses it”.

●Game experiences only with VR
You can experience the opening and ending music videos with 360 degrees as well as interactions with the heroines at a very close range.

-Synopsis-
Spring, 2018.
Kyosuke Sakurai – you – awaken in the city of Shibuya, Tokyo, oddly quiet and devoid of its bustle.
Nobody is around. The only exception is the group of eight childhood friends, which you used to be a part of.
As the group gathers in the city’s famous scramble crossing, a blood-red message suddenly flashes on a nearby large electronic billboard.
“I am dead. Who killed me?”
If this world is similar to the Chronos Worlds that emerged in the past, there is only one way to out- to find the one causing this strange phenomenon and kill the culprit.

Welcome to the world of Mini Motor Racing X! Jump into a nitro fuelled world where little cars mean BIG fun! Spanning across reclaimed ruins and scorched outbacks through to rain soaked docks and sun-kissed tropical islands - Mini Motor Racing X will take you on a micro driving journey across the globe like no other.

FEATURES:

HUGE CAREER: Collect dozens of cars and race on over 50 tracks in hundreds of races with vibrant, rich visuals, day and night and in varying weather conditions. 

UPGRADE YOUR RIDES: Pump your hard earned winnings into upgrades to help give you the edge.

MULTIPLAYER: Full online multiplayer with up to 4 friends and campaign co-op.

MULTIPLE WAYS TO PLAY: Play from in-car, top-down, track-side or anywhere else that takes your fancy! Packed with comfort and control options including Virtual Wheel, RC Controller, motion controls and more!

BUMPER BALL: Play online with friends and score some goals in this and other frantic party modes.

Party Pack Update!

Huge new update adding four new game modes!

In Bombs Away, all players start in the center of the arena. A random player starts with the bomb, which brings with it enhanced speed. The player with the bomb can ram another player to pass the bomb onto them. Whoever has the bomb when the fuse runs down (and explodes) loses one health pip, and they start with a fresh bomb. Last one standing wins.

In King of the Road, all players once again start in the center of the arena, with a random player donning the crown—which earns you points while wearing it. Players must try to ram the crown holder to get the crown for themselves. Whoever has the most points when the time limit runs out wins.

Each player in Battle Arena starts with three health pips, and cars start spread out across the arena. Players pick up random weapons or items and attempt to attack the other players while avoiding their attacks. Last one standing wins.

Drop Zone mixes things up, with players starting spaced out around a floating platform. Players aim to knock each other off the edge of the platform—which shrinks over time, increasing the danger. Last one standing wins.

This isn't a game. Richie’s Plank Experience is a psychological experience that your visitors and guests will react to with exhilaration, fear or laughter. For the VR veteran, even more entertainment comes watching the reactions of others.

You're on a plank, 80 stories high. Knees shaky, palms sweaty. Do you walk or do you freeze? Richie's Plank Experience is the only VR experience that lets you clone a real-world object into the virtual world for added immersion. Yes, you can adjust the length, width, height and orientation of the in-game plank.

It’s not just a plank.
There’s something for everyone. In Hero Academy, you can:
fly through the city in Rocket Race;
save the city in Missile Defense;
and extinguish fires in Fire Fight! 

Is that it?
The Sky Brush level will slow you down with a zen-like skywriting experience and if you are an adventurous adult, try the infamous Nightmare Mode in the hidden elevator panel.

Warning! In the Ultimate Fishing Simulator the fish are biting like crazy. We guarantee that you’ll never fall asleep.

Ultimate Fishing Simulator is a comprehensive fishing simulator which allows using various techniques, in different places around the world and most importantly, you don’t need a permanent connection to the Internet for it.

If you are bored of waiting for fish to take and falling asleep in front of the computer, this means that you have played a bad game! In the Ultimate Fishing Simulator this will never happen. Select the appropriate equipment and bait, cast your line and wait for a bite. Success is guaranteed.

In addition to traditional fishing techniques, in Ultimate Fishing Simulator you’ll also find a winter map where you will be able to go ice fishing! Buy an auger at the store, find a suitable location and drill an airhole. But not too small, so that you can remove the fish.

There are two modes of difficulties in the Ultimate Fishing Simulator, thanks to which there is something for everyone. Normal Mode allows you to enjoy the game in all its glory. In normal mode, all the features in the game are included. Realistic Mode requires more patience and efficiency from the player. Fish will be biting less and will fight longer. Some of the game features in this mode are disabled, such as the underwater camera.

Every fisherman likes to admire his trophies. Some release their fish, other stuff and hang them on their walls. In Ultimate Fishing Simulator you can exactly do the same! Decide yourself what you want to do with the fish you catch. Sell? Release? Stuff? The choice is yours.

If the maps available in the game bore you, you can create your own. Be creative and build your own dream fishery that you can share other players thanks to the built-in level editor. Enjoy fishing with your friends on your favorite, family fishery. What more could you ask for?

Everybody likes to use brand-name equipment, which very often differentiates from the competition with its parameters and appearance. We are the only fishing game that has a license for SAKURA equipment (SERT S.A.S.). You will find in our game their rods, reels, baits and lines. Each item has been mapped in detail and added to the game.

*connection to the Internet is required to play the game in multiplayer mode.

499d5868-f5a2-43d9-8f5b-7da7a783b6de,Blasters of the Universe,"¥1,480","Description

Blasters of the Universe is the first of its kind, bringing the bullet hell genre into first person VR. Build a bad-ass gun from thousands of combinations then get ready to duck and dodge your way through a shit-ton of bullets in this nostalgic – and nerve-wracking – VR Bullet Hell shooter for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.

BULLET HELL
You'll need to physically duck, dodge, twist, and turn your way through hundreds of bullets. We scale the action dynamically to make use of the space you have available, so the more you move around the better!

Like in a traditional bullet hell game, the key to success is finding the 'sweet spot' to be in while the onslaught of bullets flies toward you. The only thing that can take damage in Blasters is your head. When you see a circle of bullets, often the best thing to do is to keep your head right in the middle and let the bullets breeze right by you.

You can also block bullets with your shield as a last resort, but it's impossible to block everything. Avoidance is the best strategy, so start moving around your play-space and dodge those bullets!

ENEMIES
You will encounter a variety of enemies within Blasters that you need to dispatch. From fast moving ground enemies, to agile flying enemies, and deadly lumbering tanks. Each enemy will pose a different threat level to you, so you'll need to quickly identify what enemies are the most important to destroy first.

BOSS BATTLES
Blasters of the Universe features a 4 level Campaign for you to battle through, each ending with an epic boss battle. In each level, you'll battle new enemies, unlock new weapon parts and shields, and work your way towards glory. Each level also features an Endless Mode where you can fight for a high score on the leaderboards.

WEAPON CUSTOMIZATION
As you progress through the levels, you'll unlock new weapon parts to take into battle. You can build a custom weapon that suits your play style and the challenges you face. Want a super-fast firing hit-scan weapon that deals poison damage to enemies? No problem. What about a scatter-shot cannon that deals explosive damage and arcs shots towards nearby enemies? Can do. With tens of thousands of unique combinations to choose from, you have the ability to create a weapon that perfectly suits your style.

SPECIALS
The Frame is the core of every gun. Each Frame in Blasters has a unique special ability that you can unleash to deal devastation to the enemies attacking you and help turn the tides during an intense battle.

These specials range from a bad-ass giant laser that melts anything it hits to a time-bubble that slows everything down and gives you the upper hand for dodging incoming bullets. Each special is unique and has different strengths that you can use to your advantage.

CHALLENGE MODE
Constantly updating Challenge modes with unique gameplay ensure there is something new and exciting to play every day. Compete for the top score in Time Attack, Endless, and Speed-run challenges that push you to play in unique and difficult ways.

Deep within a forest no one has ever seen, in a field no one has ever stepped foot in, you come upon a house that should not exist. You push the door open, step inside, and begin to record. Scientific papers and instruments are everywhere, the research of Dr. Lawrence Talbot, reported missing more than 50 years ago... 

For Katherine Patterson, a video blogger and explorer of the abandoned, Talbot’s mansion is the story of a lifetime, worth millions. But as you begin to unravel the mysteries Talbot has left behind, nothing can prepare you for the truth that lies ahead. Record everything you see, for in Talbot’s world, nothing is as it seems. 

Torn is a VR mystery inspired by works such as The Twilight Zone and Black Mirror.  The story was written by video game writer Susan O’Connor (Tomb Raider, Bioshock) and its score composed by the Garry Schyman (Bioshock).

When you hear a flash of a human voice on the radio, your hopes surge - there are survivors out in the blistering heat of the post-apocalyptic Grand Canyon state!

Survive solo or join forces with fellow survivors, handle weapons with real-life movements, and freely explore a post-apocalyptic world in VR. Putting the undead back to rest is more thrilling than ever before.

•	Co-op multiplayer: Join forces with a friend in co-op campaign mode or multiplayer Horde mode for up to four players. But beware, more warm brains mean more hungry undead.
•	Real-life weapon handling: Using VR motion controllers, handle 25+ weapons with real-life movements. Anticipate attacks, manage ammo and aim down the sights to blast your enemies to undead pieces.
•	Full-size campaign: Built in bite-sized VR chunks that together form a full narrative, the campaign allows you to jump in for a short session or stay for the complete ride.
•	Free exploration: Move around without restraints to explore a series of huge southwestern American environments, including treacherous canyons and deep, dark mines.
•	Immersive zombie survival: Scavenge the environment, loot undead enemies and manage your ammo and consumables in a battle for survival more immersive than ever before thanks to VR.

You are one of many who set off in search of a better life in the distant bastion of scientific progress. Your goal is a colony planet, free from bureaucratic, religious and other radical restrictions.

Here they research and freely use industrial teleportation, transfer of consciousness and other technologies prohibited in the inhabited worlds. Factories, power plants, mines and residential complexes of the planet are fully automated. All the dirty and hard work is done by robotic shells controlled by the operator’s mind. It is a high-tech paradise. But here, something went wrong.

As soon as you wake up from a long sleep in a capsule of hibernation, you fall into circulation. Radical fanatics are here too. A virus was launched into information networks that turned robots into aggressive death machines. The paradise planet plunged into the chaos of war. The inhabitants of the colony took the seats of the operators of robotic shells and sent their army of robots into battle. Joint efforts have borne fruit.

The virus is localized, stripping is approaching the final phase. But the “robot riot” is just the tip of the space-iceberg that the planet has encountered. Everything that happens next goes beyond understanding and plunges the planet into utter darkness.

Your hibernation capsule is stuck in quarantine on an orbital station. But this is not a time to relax. Control the robotic shell of an engineering department directly from orbit! Immerse yourself in the thick of events and witness the inexplicable global cataclysm. Guess its nature and save the planet. But first, survive yourself.

Boiling Steel is a Sci-Fi VR shooter with an intriguing storyline.
- A unique system for quick reloading weapons adds drive and gives a unique gaming experience.
- Nine different tools with original mechanic of two-handed grip allow the player choose their own playing style.
- The weapon upgrade system automatically improves a favorite and frequently used tool, gradually turning it into a hellish machine.
- The ability to enhance selected parameters of the robotic shell adapts the gameplay for the player.
- Randomly generated biomes and dangers make each new playthrough unique.
- Thoughtful story missions reveal the gloomy secrets of the planet and keep the intrigue to the very end.
- Realistic graphics are completely immersed in the exciting reality of the fantastic world of the future.
- A minimum of 10 hours of gameplay, even for experienced players.

Welcome to the Boiling Steel universe! Explore, fight and share your impressions. The opinion of each player is important to our team.

And remember, a tool on overdrive is cooler than any weapon.

Pangman takes you inside a VR classic arcade game experience, where your goal is to burst as many spheres as possible by using a pair of guns that transform into hooks when you throw them. Complete 140 story mode levels in individual or cooperative campaign, and enjoy frantic multiplayer games with up to 8 players.

Pangman could be summed up in these 12 words:
FUN: Exploding spheres shooting your gun and your hook while altering the laws of time and physics is totally rewarding
NOSTALGIA: Relive the essence of classic video games in VR.
SIMPLE: Simplified controls, suitable for VR beginners. Mastering the gameplay, though, requires lots of practice.
DIRECT: No loading times or complex tutorials. Intuitive mechanics and gameplay.
SICKNESS: Action takes place inside an arcade simulation and there's no need to move, so there's no possibility of motion sickness
HUMOR: Script crammed with humor, silly puns and loads of references to general culture, classic video games and The Matrix saga.
SOCIAL: The story mode can be played in cooperative mode and there's also an arena mode for endless games with up to 8 players.
ROOM-SCALE: Pangman can be played even sitting down. But if you have a space of 2x2 meters, you'll have a great time dodging spheres.
MATRIX: The story and characters are loosely inspired by The Matrix saga, as well as the ""Dynamyc Timer"", a slow-motion power-up that takes us inside The Matrix universe.
REPLAYABILITY: Story mode includes 140 levels that can be played alone or in cooperative mode. There's also included an infinite online mode.
BEAUTIFUL: Simple but attractive cartoon graphics, bright and colorful.
SOUNDS: Spatializer 3D sound effects. Original soundtrack including 30 different themes.

Your spaceship has a few... eccentricities, work with your Spaceteam in order to get as far through space as you can. The ship's computer uses an approach to language that we lovingly refer to as ""technobabble"" - sometimes it might not use actual words, requiring a healthy amount of interpretation and clear communication from your Spaceteam.

DON'T PANIC!
Even if this is your first space flight, it's ok, the ship will give you instructions, it's just that they might not apply to a control on the console in front of you. They might be for a control on a teammate's console so you will need to tell them, quickly, and probably loudly.

If your Spaceteam is able to complete enough instructions successfully in a sector you will progress to the next, each sector becomes increasingly difficult and as the ship becomes harder to control and eventually, inevitably, you will explode.

YOUR COMET INNOVATIONS TOOL KIT

Floating within arms reach to your right and left are your trusty tools which will, hopefully, help you to deal with the myriad of threats and anomalies that take place onboard the ship.

Repair Hammer – used to repair broken controls
Ray-Gun – used to shoot enemy invaders
Steri-Sponge 3000 – used to clean up the enemy invaders slime
Fire Extinguisher – used to extinguish the unavoidable fires
Airhorn – for use when instructed by the Ship

SPACE IS A DANGEROUS PLACE
Anomalies and aliens pop up when you least expect it, often adding to your workload and bringing your inexorable doom ever closer. Some that you may encounter include...

UFOs
Small flying saucers appear at the outer edges of the play area and shoot at player’s controls, setting them on fire. Player’s use their ray guns to shoot back!

SLIMES
Floating green alien monsters who spit goop onto player’s consoles, players need to wipe the goop up with the sponge and shoot the Slimes down with their ray guns.

ROBOT FRIENDS
The robots that live on the ship are friendly and try to be helpful. They are responsive to players – if you wave at them, they wave back, and don’t take kindly to being shot at. They play games with each other and explore the ship at their leisure during down-time.
There are three ways to play Spaceteam VR:

FULL VR MULTIPLAYER
Up to six players, connected to the internet, in any popular VR headset join in a cooperative game of trying to avoid their binding doom.

FACE TO FACE
Up to six players play locally with at least one VR headset and connected smart devices, this offers an experience much like the original Spaceteam game. In the VR game each mobile player is represented by a robot.

SINGLE PLAYER
If you don’t have any friends around or there's no one online you want to play with head to the Practice Mode and you and two of our trusty robots will form your Spaceteam.

STAR SHAMAN is an active VR adventure with touches of roguelite. Become a STAR SHAMAN and embark on an epic journey to bring the spark of life back into a universe depleted to boring cubes by the Architects of Entropy. Cast spells using the Shaman Sphere to invoke a wide range of weapons and fight your way through spectacularly looking galaxies to the beat of a French Touch soundtrack.

Hop from planet to planet and from solar system to solar system in a stunningly beautiful and procedurally generated universe where no playthrough is ever the same. Fall, try again and unlock powerful new weapons and abilities to find your playstyle. Invoke them using a unique and ultra-satisfying motion-based spellcasting system that will soon make you feel invincible.

Battle armadas of deadly mechanical enemies until you reach epic boss fights that block your path to new solar systems. Meet a quirky roster of characters, each with their own agendas along the way.
 
And don't forget to admire the finer details of the extraordinary life forms you're bringing back to life as you chase the corrupt Architects of Entropy to the most remote corners of their cubic universe. 

For you are a STAR SHAMAN, a champion of biodiversity and the galaxy's last resort.

Greetings Young Shaman,

Here at Lunar Grove we have been circling the galaxy in preparation for your next voyage. We are incredibly grateful for all the initial feedback we received on the game. Please don’t stop sharing. We love hearing from you. 


Today, Star Shaman Player Progression Update will be released and with it comes some big changes.

Generally, you will see a stronger sense of character building and storytelling. Weapons and perks will unlock in the Reliquary during the game (instead of when you die). But, each time you die, perks and persistent spells will unlock giving you more strength for your return. 

Be on the lookout for 15 new moons. Just when you thought you had the map memorized, we remind you the galaxy is enormous, and your planet-hopping has just begun!

You have proven your strength and intelligence. In this update, we believe you are ready for a new Beam, Nova, and Jolt Daemon spells.
•	Beam: Hold trigger to channel it towards enemies.
•	Nova: Stun/Fry hand-thrown grenade.
•	Jolt Daemon: A jolt-firing entity to fight alongside you for a limited time.

We know it can be discouraging when you respawn but respawning also means you get more money ($$$). More money means you can buy more things in the shop at the beginning of each run.

The tutorial has been entirely reworked thanks to your feedback. You will see it is shorter and more fluid to move through. It also emphasizes the use of both hands as using the shield is key 

For our Quest 2 Shaman, improvements are set for a beautiful 90Hz refresh rate.

As you enter the war against the Architects of Entropy, you will notice a reworked HUD (Heads-Up-Display) where it is easier to check your hit points and current score. 

Your time traveling has sped up! The tunnels are shorter from planet to planet making your time traveling through space more dynamic. We know every second counts in the fight to save life. 

You will hear that every character has its own distinct voice, and our favorite mentor Heidi is now speaking English when the astral teleporter allows it (since the death dialogues are not dubbed). 

Now our Shamans speaking Spanish, Italian, Japanese, and Chinese can join in on the fun. These Shaman will join the English, French, and German speaking Shaman on their quest. That’s seven languages supported now.

A serene, mystical journey that traverses a series of otherworldly, organic landscapes, Fujii is a respite for weary travelers. The experience flows between outdoor exploration and creative gardening, merging aspects of adventure and cultivation into a refreshing, musically enveloping whole.

After emerging from a mystical tree, players venture out to explore three unique and magical biomes. Watering, touching, and interacting in musical ways with plants and creatures throughout each biome restores its lifeforce, and expands the energetic rings of light that hover above. Each biome brings its own biodiversity and plant interactions, eventually leading players to the source of Fujii’s powerful energy well. 

Fujii also lets players gather a host of exotic seeds from its varied biomes, which they can bring home to cultivate and customize their own unique, otherworldly garden. By lifting planters out of the ground and sowing seeds in pots of various shapes and sizes, players are able to craft unique, bountiful landscapes for virtual relaxation.

Escape a merciless mansion alongside a girl words cannot reach, in a tale that can only be experienced in VR.

An escape-the-room adventure game that can only be experienced in VR, Last Labyrinth was created specifically for the VR age. Players must work to escape a mansion full of hidden dangers with a mysterious girl that appears before them.

Development of Last Labyrinth is being spearheaded by Hiromichi Takahashi, director and producer of the acclaimed Doko Demo Issyo (PlayStation® 1999) series and co-creator of Toro (the Sony Cat). Working alongside him is Co-Director Tetsuya Watanabe, previously a game designer on Puppeteer and The Last Guardian (in-game physics); Lead Animator Atsuko Fukuyama, best known for her work in animating the non-verbal characters that players work alongside with in ICO and Shadow of the Colossus; Lead Environment Artist Michiko Kusaba, who worked as a Landscape Designer on Gran Turismo 3:A-Spec and Gran Turismo 4; and Sound Designer Takuya Hanaoka, whose past works include Monster Rancher and the Super Robot Wars series.

With resumes featuring titles that are household names around the world, the team is now taking on the unique challenges of creating a VR game that revolves around “non-verbal communication”, and are committed to bringing Katia and the world of Last Labyrinth to life.

Katia is voiced by none other than international model, actress, voice-actress and singer, Stefanie Joosten, who was also the voice and model for the silent and deadly Quiet in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.

The theme song is composed by renowned video game music composer Hiroki Kikuta, famous for his work on titles such as Seiken Densetsu 2 and 3 and Sōkaigi, among others. Following her performance on ""Quiet's Theme"", Stefanie Joosten once again lends her vocal talents for the Last Labyrinth theme song.

STORY
What the…?!

Your eyes begin to adjust to the darkness, and you find yourself in a room you’ve never seen before. You go to stand but are barely able to move. You look down to find that your arms and legs are strapped to a wheelchair.

As the panic begins to set it, you catch a glimpse of a figure out of the corner of your eye.

!?

A young girl, standing in the darkness, stares at you with cold eyes…

Fight in front of a blood thirsty crowd as a Sci-Fi Gladiator in Swords of Gurrah. Swords of Gurrah is a virtual reality game focused around hand-to-hand combat weapons. Fighters come from all over of their own free will to risk their lives against man or beast!!!! Fight to the death all to experience the thrill of victory - and if defeated to die for glory!

Gurrah is a single player and multiplayer online game. It takes skill beyond typical gaming to keep up: swing, slice, slash, dodge, duck, and destroy. VR does amazing things to bring life-like hand-to-hand combat into your home.

The Weapons:
These weapons are designed to shatter and regrow on every collision. This allows you to block and parry in a way previously never before seen in Virtual Reality due to the limitations of the technology. No longer will VR sword fighting feel clunky and inconsistent; the weapons are light weight, fluid but pack a punch.

Gurrah has a wide selection of weapons: one hand swords, shields, glaives, spears, axes, heavy-class swords, double-sided sabers, daggers, and throwing stars. Select and train, the choice is yours!

The Beasts:
The arena presents many threats to keep gladiators on their toes. Fully armored bulls, tigers, hydras and more are ready for battle. Bred and bio-engineered to fight with ferocity. Each beast presents a new challenge, testing the ability of a warrior to adjust on the fly. The crowd must be entertained!

Viveport Developer Award 2017: Create 1st Place

Fantastic Contraption is surreal building game for Vive VR. Create life-sized machines as tall as you can reach, then send them whirling, flinging, and trundling off to solve puzzles on the other side of a floating island. Your task is simple: get the squishy purple ball to that goal off in the distance, or above you, or on the other side of that gap. And your tools are elegantly minimalist: spinning wheels and stretchable rods. But the solutions are endless, and there are no right or wrong ones. We've designed this game from the ground up for room-scale VR. Come immerse yourself in a strange skybound archipelago and befriend Neko the photosynthesizing cat. Build contraptions with your own two hands, life sized and as big as horses, right there in front of you. Play with the physics, juggle pieces, throw darts, and feel another world all around you.
(also playable on Oculus Rift)

The more you move and the stronger you hit, the higher your score. Have fun while training your stamina, strength, and reflexes.

ef2013fe-74da-4974-8209-91feb442aa31,The Morrigan,"¥2,050","Description

Step into this world of beautiful stylised graphics and explore striking, handcrafted environments - torch in one hand, big axe in the other. Gameplay is a rich, multi-layered experience, with surprising charm and heart.

Features:
Dramatic combat system:
This is what VR swordplay should be: free-flowing attacks and blocks that allow you to feel the rhythm of combat. Dynamic physics-based melee combat delivers a reaction to every hit.

Can it still be bullet time if it’s with arrows?
Bend time to dodge arrows or strike them out of the air - if you’re fast enough.

Swordplay that’s easy to learn yet challenging to master
Chain blocks and attacks unleash devastating counter attacks that can turn the tide of battle in your favour. Five different enemy attack styles to get your teeth into.

And what would a dungeon be without puzzles?
This new game has got you covered. Keys, switches, hidden rooms - the whole enchilada.

And if heart-stopping peril is your thing...
This game will have you dodging terrifying traps (that you can then use against your enemies) and climbing across death-defying drops.

No time for questing?
Drop into the arena and enjoy wave after wave of enemies - and unlock weapons to use in the main campaign or arena.

Looking for story?
The basics: a desperate king strikes a deal with the Morrigan to get him out of a tight spot, sacrificing his (unborn) daughter’s freedom. Time passes, and the daughter eventually succeeds the throne. The Morrigan returns to call in the debt… unless you can stop her, that is. But she is a god, so good luck with that!

A whole armoury of weapons
Tool up with swords, axes, shields, bows - play in whatever style you like, with over 20 weapons to choose from.

A range of locomotion options
Free locomotion, teleport or both supported. Left- or right-handed? Not a problem.

You find yourself confined to a wheelchair in a gloomy old research facility. Where am I? Why am I here? Where do I go from here? The spine-chilling eerie spaces and your imagination will fuel your fear leading you to the realization that something horrible has happened here. Trying to hide from the undead will make your heart race and take your breath away, because you cannot kill what is already dead. In creating Deadness the emphasis was on the game looking as realistic as possible, including intuitive controls, naturalistic graphics and horror atmosphere. Just like in reality, on the wheelchair you can only move using your hands which control all the movements which makes the game feel even more realistic.

You are going to feel utterly helpless. This game will give you nightmares…

This is not a game!

The Elder God has vanished! In the wake of her disappearance, a power vacuum has appeared in the heavens and war has erupted!

Tabletop Gods is a fast-paced, real-time, arcade action war game, with a hint of tower defense thrown in for good measure. Playing the role of a god, you and your opponent lead your armies against each other across virtual tabletop battlefields with one goal in mind: to destroy more of your opponent’s Strongholds than they destroy of yours.

The hectic battles in Tabletop Gods last at most 15 minutes, often less. At the start of a match you'll choose which of the three factions you wish to command: Human, Undead or Demon. You'll also choose which of the three unique tables you want to battle on, each one being at the center of its own Arena. Each battle is played over three increasingly frantic rounds. At the start of each round you have a short time to place fiendish traps and mighty weapon towers in secret, as well as the opportunity to switch your troops and spells for the upcoming round. After preparing for war, the next 3-minute round of intense battle commences in which you'll be deploying troops and casting spells in an attempt to destroy your opponent's Strongholds while striving to defend your own.

Each tabletop battlefield is the centerpiece of its own 'Arena'. An arena holds up to 8 players who are free to move around and voice chat with each other, whether they are playing a match or spectating. Spectators even have the ability to shrink down onto the table and watch the battle from a troops-eye view! You can create your own arena to play in, or browse the currently open arenas and jump into an existing one. You can even create a private arena for just you and your friends.

Tabletop Gods features a head-to-head multiplayer mode, and single-player Skirmish and Trials modes. The short, intense matches and social arenas are perfect for quick one-off games or for longer multiple-battle sessions. The game is fully cross-platform, so whatever system you're playing on, whether you're playing flat-screen or in VR,  you can play with every other Tabletop Gods player.

See you in the Arena!

90ebc7ad-5b5e-491d-b921-ea1de9c13c7f,A Chair in a Room: Greenwater,"¥2,480","Description

Room scale VR horror!

A Chair in a Room: Greenwater is a tense Virtual Reality horror game set in America’s Deep South. Drawing on elements of Southern Gothic and using settings of derelict towns, run-down motels and murky, decaying swamps, A Chair in a Room will take you through an investigation of institutional corruption, religious immorality and murder, which can only be unlocked by searching deep within your own psyche. 

A calibration room will allow you get comfortable in VR but once you call the elevator, you begin your story as patient no. 6079 in The Greenwater Institute, with no recollection of who you are or what you did to be here. Dark visions bring your lucidity into question and only the doctor’s supply of medication can suppress those who wish to haunt you. 

Gameplay is a seamless weave of interaction and narrative that wraps exploration and tense horror in rich environmental storytelling to create something that is unique to VR. 

The story is broken down into six chapters of around 20 to 30 minutes in length to allow for intervals in play while enjoying the story.

REMASTERED: New locomotion options, updated music, graphics and many more optimisations available in a free update.

Prison Boss VR is a crafting and trading game using room-scale to turn your VR space into a jail cell! Craft cigarettes, alcohol and cookies for other inmates! Customize your cell as your reputation grows! Earn cash until you can’t store it anymore and become the Prison Boss!

When night falls, you’re free to craft anything you have the materials for. However, be sure to stay alert, as guards are patrolling and will put an end to your doings as soon as they spot your belongings. When the guards come, hide your things in your furniture to get through the night without losing the items you worked so hard for.

Take jobs to unlock new possibilities and grow your reputation. Trade stuff to earn money, so you can buy more materials for crafting. Find the balance between crafting for jobs and trading for money. Try to progress while earning enough cash to acquire new tools and improve your jail cell.

To learn every crafting recipe, you’ll need to become the Prison Boss of all 4 jails and escape from them! If you want to test your skills, go into Arcade mode where every material is unlocked right from the start and fight the clock to craft the most items you can!

- 11 Different Items Available For Crafting
- 4 Prisons With Over 80 Jobs to Complete
- Unlockable Arcade Mode 
- Play VR room-scale the way it was meant to be played
- Great jazzy soundtrack!
(also playable on Oculus Rift)

Train to become the greatest Kung Fu Master the world has ever seen. You will begin as a tourist to Martial Arts, with no experience and slow reflexes. You will progressively move onto harder tiers of training, faster and more complex, until you no longer need to think but simply react.

In Crazy Kung Fu you will fight against a wooden training dummy, using your hands as well as your body to punch, block and dodge the various spinning arms. Throughout your journey you will learn how to be a master at all of these, building muscle memory at first, to then rely on instinct and quick thinking.

All your moves are tracked, you will have statistics on speed, accuracy, strength, all of which will help you assess your progress, target your weaknesses and push towards becoming a Kung Fu Master.

The Holy City is an immersive virtual reality gamified experience that transports participants to Jerusalem and provides access to the most sacred rituals and the holiest sites of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.  With stunning volumetric captures of the holiest sites in Jerusalem, you are immersed in Jerusalem, witnessing the timeless rituals of The Holy Fire, Ramadan, Sukkot and Passover. 

Share in this experience with family and friends while completing challenges, solving puzzles, and discovering shared values. Through the gameplay,  you are met with tasks as you travel through volumetric captures of Jerusalem, unlocking clues at The Western Wall and underground tunnels, The Holy Sepulchre, St. James Monastery, Al-Aqsa mosque and The Dome Of The Rock.

For the first time, the holiest sites and holiest of days of Jerusalem have been captured with Photogrammetry, Stereoscopic 360, and Volumetric Filming. An inter-faith team of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim filmmakers brings this unique perspective to share the magic and wonder of Jerusalem in one of the most complex immersive projects produced to date.  The experience was created to cultivate understanding by exploring our shared values and fundamental similarities.

WHAT’S NEW 
The Holy City VR was named one of Forbes Top 50 XR Experiences Of 2019 and has been awarded a Lumiere Award for Best Educational XR, and Best Interactive VR Experience at the 2019 Byron Bay Film festival. 

For thousands of years, believers have been coming to Jerusalem during festivals and religious holidays. This year, with travel and public gatherings limited due to the pandemic, we invite you to take a virtual trip to The Holy City.

Build a medieval village within a completely interactively simulated world!

Townsmen VR uses the exciting possibilities of virtual reality to further enhance the classic city building game with entirely new gameplay experiences and interactive mechanics. The game combines elements of a God-game simulation and a classic building game with the interactive possibilities of VR controls. Whether from a bird's eye view or zoomed in close, you will always experience the action from the right perspective.

Start with a small settlement and expand your might over a world of 13 different islands and archipelagos. Filled to the brim with exciting features, gizmos, and things to lay your virtual hands on. Build more than 20 unique buildings and upgrade them. Immerse yourself in a thrilling story with many exciting quests that will provide you with hours of fun!

As the population of your empire grows, so does the demand for food and goods. Production chains help you meet this need. When you build farms, you can grind the grain harvest there at the mill and bake delicious bread for your Townies from the flour. Your windmill won’t operate when the winds are calm? No worries, give those wings a push. Slap that lazy dude with a fish or help your citizens collect about 20 different raw materials. You want to see the world you helped create from the view of a townsman? Use your godly powers and scale yourself to experience your town at eye level with your townies.

Farm animals such as cows, sheep, and chickens provide you with important resources to produce food. Your hunters will find rabbits and deer to stalk. You have to be careful of wild animals like wolves or bears that you encounter! Seagulls are eager to steal your catch, while above the battlefields the crows' caw, and high up in the sky eagles fly free.

In time you should begin to also hire soldiers to defend your realm against intruders and enemy forces! Besides different types of soldiers, you can also make use of heavy artillery: A catapult can punch sensitive gaps in the enemy’s ranks! And should you run out of boulders, remember: everything you can lay your hands on can be used as ammo! But the enemy kingdom is not the only problem your soldiers will have to face. Some islands are infested with sinister pirates who are after your precious resources!

Intuitive control of the environment helps you move about – you can literally crawl over the island or move your viewpoint as you would position your images on your smartphone. You’ll get accustomed to ruling your empire very fast.

Most of the islands you visit during the campaign can be unlocked for unrestricted play in the sandbox mode. You'll be able to choose whether you want to play completely without constraints, or give yourself a bit of excitement and accept the challenges you choose. Determine the number of townies you start the game with, defeat all opponents or fight against thieving pirates – the various settings offer you enough freedom for your personal gaming experience!

Story – A fully-voiced campaign and story arching over 13 islands.
Simulation  – Assign jobs and tasks to your villagers to build your supply chains and economy.
Town-planning – Unlock more than 20 unique buildings and place them freely within your village to optimize transport routes. Apply upgrades to make them better!
Upgrades – Conduct research for further upgrades of your buildings.
Trading – Build a harbor to have a trader's ship and begin treasuring up riches.
Experience – Brush over trees, form clouds into dangerous thunderstorms, go fishing with your bare hands and talk to your townies.
Interaction – Simply carry workers or resources directly to their destination to speed up the construction of buildings and production.
Fight – Recruit brave soldiers, build catapults, bows, and crossbows to protect your island from the Black Knights raiding henchmen.
Tutorial – Your personal advisor Sir Clunk-a-lot will accompany you on your virtual tour of the medieval age with useful tips.
Sandbox Mode – Get creative and try out the game conditions you set in free play. Decide for yourself which tasks you want to complete and enjoy full freedom!
Sound – Medieval music, adorable sound effects, and a classy English voiceover ensure a fitting atmosphere.

3251d7b2-1406-4c24-89ff-012743ca11c0,1976 - Back to midway,"¥1,520","Description

Are you ready to travel back in time to 1943 and relive the excitement of classic arcade dogfights? Now, thanks to Virtual Reality, you’re about to discover a new level of immersion and spectacularity, while retaining the original essence and fun.

The story
It’s the year 1976. We’re in a dystopian reality in which the Nazi army ended up defeating the Allied Front and winning the Great War. In this apocalyptic parallel universe, Hitler has declared himself Supreme World Chancellor and, what’s even more terrifying, Tyrolean pants are all the rage across the globe. 
However, there’s still hope. Despite the scarcity of resources, the Allied resistance’s brightest scientists, led by the eccentric Dr. Ivan Ivanovich, have made the impossible possible: they’ve built a time machine.
Thus, thanks to the Quantum Air Combat Simulator, the Virtual Reality prototype designed by Dr. Ivanovich, you’ll have the opportunity to travel back in time and take part in the most momentous air battles of World War II.
But pay attention! Playing with quantum reality and altering the path of history can have the most unforeseen consequences…
  
Classic Essence / VR Technology
Sit in front of the huge 3D Quantum Simulator screen, fasten your seatbelt and relive the magic of legendary vertical scrolling titles.
Alternate the “classic” point of view with the first-person perspective, while performing impossible maneuvers to dodge enemy fire. Be amazed by the dynamic scenario elements that will pop off at you. Never has a simulation seemed so real and fast-paced.
  
Air Combat / Immersion Zones
As Ivanovich Games already did in the successful “Operation Warcade”, all the scenarios in “1976: Back to Midway” include several Immersion Zones, which allow the player to move inside the aircraft cabin, offering new and thrilling challenges. An experience that only Virtual Reality can provide. 
Take control of the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and the B-17G Flying Fortress exact replicas, test your pilot skills, become a flying ace, and change history forever.

Features
- 16 story-mode levels filled with humor.
- 24 immersion zones.
- 64 missions.
- More than 200 aircraft upgrades.
- Tons of action without tutorials or inserting coins; enjoy infinite retries.
- Compatible with Vive, Oculus, and WMR.
- Compatible with HOTAS controllers, PC controllers, Xbox, PS4, and, of course, VR controllers: Index, Touch, Wand, etc.
- Compatible with motion simulators.

Pizza Master VR is a fast paced pizza making game for Virtual Reality. Work as a chef and wield 8 core ingredients to create a wide range of pizzas to satisfy your customers. But don't slack off- their patience is always ticking!
You will find yourself easily immersed with the intuitive gameplay and Pixar inspired visuals. With your progressing skills, business will quickly boom, both a blessing and a curse. Customers will become harder and harder to please, robbers will start coming, and if you don't up your standards you will find yourself out on the streets again!
Single player and local multiplayer co-op are both included.
Features:
● Just like your first minimum wage job at a takeaway. But apparently more colorful, adrenaline pumping and fun.
● Asymmetric local co-op mode. The VR player works as the pizza chef, while someone connected on the same PC works as a waiter on the mouse and keyboard. Teamwork and communication is important, because only the waiter can see and serve orders, while only the chef can create them!
● 55 levels in total, including both single player and local multiplayer. Levels increase gradually in difficulty, and are replayable due to a star system. Expect many hours of gameplay.
● Endless mode for both single player and multiplayer, integrated along with Steam Leaderboards. Serve as many customers as possible before they become too much for your sanity!
● 12 unique recipes to master in the local multiplayer mode, gradually introduced throughout the levels.
● Defend your store from robbers. Do anything you can to stop them, maybe chuck a olive at them.
● Perfect family game. Height is fully adjustable.
● XBOX Controller support for waiter in co-op mode
● A shop system where you can buy new themes and characters with ingame money

Witching Tower: Heroes is a fantasy action game developed exclusively for VR.

You are a Defender from Citadel of Light, sent to a war-torn kingdom to deal with undead hordes from the Dark Tower. With four weapon types, each with a unique fighting style, you take on missions to cleanse the land from foul creatures. You will fight against undead nobles, soldiers, wardens, sorcerers and their hideous minions. Long dead, they will haunt you, attack you, fiddle with your plans and tactics; they will do everything they can to protect their Necromancer Queen.

Game on and have fun! Relentless arcade action suitable even for people new to VR!

Features:

You own fighting style.
What will you pick? Good old melee, archery, firearms or a powerful drill that shreds skeleton enemies into pieces? How about a staff of Fire and Light, capable of reigning fire and brimstone on the battlefield? Do you like crushing the undead up close and personal or do you like keeping your distance and supporting the team? There’s always a way to experiment with weapons or even the surroundings!

Hordes of undead and humongous bosses!
Every enemy is special, with its own unique attack patterns, behaviour and weak points. Foul, unnerving, disgusting undead hordes will pursue you with unrelenting intent to destroy everything in their path!

Unique missions.
Protect, destroy, chase and, most importantly, survive under the onslaught of undead hordes!

Claim your title as a true Hero!
Acquire points in combat to become the best on the global leaderboard. Show everyone that you’re worthy of fame of being a Hero!

Immersive environment and atmosphere.
Realistic textures, beautiful moody lighting, special effects and VR magic bring life to gothic architecture and let you immerse into the world of dark fantasy.

Pick your control type.
Locomotion and teleport movement options are available. Are you right-handed or left-handed? Doesn’t matter, you can play however you like.

Dr. Devin Eli is a brilliant physicist at the global technology mega-conglomerate Mindful Laboratories. Working in seclusion at an atmospheric research facility in the Alaskan
wilderness, Dr. Eli is on the brink of uncovering the meaning behind a mysterious signal coming from a secret artifact - The Obelisk.

Playing as the gifted Dr. Eli, you have superhuman powers of geometric visualization - the unintended consequence of a childhood trauma. Use your powers to follow the signal through The Obelisk and explore dream-like memories to unlock puzzles in your own mind. This path could lead you to a new existence…or it could leave you trapped in your past forever.

Live your childhood nightmare and try to survive against the Boogeyman. Equipped with only your flashlight, survive each night until the morning light. Search the house for useful items such as glow sticks, cherry bombs, and coffee to help you fight back. The weather will change each night, lights will break, toys will come alive, things will go bump in the night. Learn the hiding places, and sounds of the Boogeyman to stay ahead.

• Use your flashlight to ward off the Boogeyman, it seems to be the only thing it fears.

• Learn the Boogeyman's hiding places. Watch them carefully.

• The bedside lamp, nightlight, passage light, street light, and even the moon light help you to see around the room... until they go out.

• Your batteries will only last so long. Conserve as much power or risk going under the bed for more.

• Weather will change each night, affecting the way you play. Rain will drown out noise, lightening will give you quick glimpses of the room in full light, snow blizzards will make it impossible to hear much at all.

Have you ever felt like you were living in a ceaseless repetition? Set within a scale model of 1940s São Paulo, “The Line” is a 15-20 minute interactive story about love and fear of change, allowing you to unlock an enchanted maquette of two miniature dolls, Pedro and Rosa.

This roomscale experience invites you to pull on knobs and even crawl under the scale model to unfold the story of these figurines who are perfect for each other but reluctant to live out their love.

""The Line"" is great to showcase VR for first-time users.

Narrated by Rodrigo Santoro (Westworld) and directed by Ricardo Laganaro, “The Line” was awarded the “Best VR Immersive Experience” prize at the 76th Venice International Film Festival, and the 2020 Primetime Emmy® Award for Outstanding Innovation in Interactive Media.

Additional modes: 
Room-scale and seated mode: Freely around the scale model, or experience the story around you for those with limited space or reduced mobility. Narration in English, Portuguese, Korean, and Simplified Chinese. SDH Subtitles in English, Portuguese, Korean, Japanese, French, Spanish, German, and simplified Chinese.

Welcome to Seeking Dawn, a science fiction VR experience that takes you far beyond the solar system. Step into the shoes of a soldier discovering a hostile planet, where predators roam freely and enemies are trigger-happy. As you follow the trail of an allied recon squad, your task is to find out what happened to them and what they came here for.

Combining sharp gunplay with dedicated survival elements, Seeking Dawn’s campaign will throw you into unforgettable environments and pit you against unforgiving adversaries. Do you have what it takes to survive?

Features
- Tailor your personal combat style from an array of diverse equipment
- Scour wild, untamed lands for clues to your mission
- Harvest exotic resources and craft an arsenal of weapons to defend your base
- Play the campaign with up to 3 other friends in co-op

Backstory
In the 23rd century, mankind has spread to the corners of the galaxy. Having been pushed too far, one human faction has begun its fight for independence, sparking a civil war between the newly formed FCR and the domineering ACC. However, not all battles are fought on the front lines: as FCR operative James Weston, you've been deployed far from civilized space, sent to investigate the disappearance of an allied team on an unforgiving alien world.
Dropped into the middle of the wilderness, relying on your wits may not be enough: you're going to want an arsenal, and the planet has everything you need to build one. An abundance of exotic ores and plants are ready to be turned into cutting edge workstations, mid-battle snacks, sturdy base defenses, and (of course) a dazzling array of high-tech weaponry. Between the savage creatures and merciless soldiers that roam the land, you'll need every bullet you can craft in order to come out on top.

With these tools at your disposal, you'll have to pick up the trail of your compatriots, forging you way through a lush forest, descending into the bowels of the earth, tramping your way through a frigid land of ice, and beyond. Just be mindful of your body's needs - out here, thirst and starvation are as dangerous as claws and guns, and death isn't picky about how it gets you.
For those undeterred, the world's secrets await discovery. Weston has a mission to accomplish, and he could use someone to guide him. Do you have what it takes to see it through?

5f07c588-a33d-4a94-9d2d-09625ec7bab4,Good Goliath,"¥2,050","Description

Once upon a time, a gentle giant wakes from a deep slumber to discover himself under attack by a tiny angry mob. With no real weapons to defend himself, the giant must use anything that he can in order to survive! In Good Goliath, players are the giant and battle against hordes of pitchfork wielding villagers, cavalry mounted soldiers, and even flying devilish imps. Good Goliath puts players in a storybook world, where they fight through vibrant and cartoon style levels.

With wave-based tower defense gameplay where players are the tower, catch and dodge pitchforks, barrels, and other weapons as they are launched. Even grab some of those tiny villagers out of the air as they launch themselves and use them to knock out their friends! Battle armies of bitty foes, formidable mini-bosses and colossal monsters as you play this arcade-action experience. From castle mountain tops, shark-infested pirate islands and creepy caverns, use everything in your power to survive the endless battle.

Key Features:

Full Campaign: Fight your way through medieval worlds, oceans overrun with pirates, and the realms of the underworld as you explore 9 levels rife with mini and massive bosses. Seek out hidden treasure in order to customize your experience to unlock new sets of hands - you never know when you can use an extra pair!

Enemies Are Your Ammo: Who needs a sword when you have an angry little villager being thrown at you? Use not only pitchforks and barrels to defend yourself, but catch the tiny humans that launch themselves at you and throw ‘em back! Your ammo is only limited by what or who you can catch. But not everyone is your enemy - keep your eye out for your friendly neighborhood baker floating through levels with some cake to help you get back to tip-top health.

Storybook-Style Comical Worlds: Dive into themed biomes, such as Medieval, Pirate, and Hell World, each filled with unique bosses and enemies. The storybook art style appeals to players of all ages.


Multi-Staged Bosses: Survive waves of tiny enemies on every level, leading to formidable mini-bosses that include fire-tossing flying witches and boulder throwing giants. Each world culminates in a gigantic standoff against a challenging monstrous boss where you battle creatures even larger than you!


Simple, Yet Challenging Gameplay: Kick back and relax while you play; with easy in-game mechanics, you can be a giant sitting or standing! Unlock special objectives, locate secrets in each level, and earn bronze, silver, and gold trophies. Pattern-based gameplay of punching, dodging, catching, and throwing makes the game accessible for players of any level.

56a462bc-d878-4766-ae91-c3c138b6ad1d,The Horus Heresy: Betrayal At Calth,"¥1,840","Description

The first shots have been fired in the conflict that will change the future of mankind. Brother Legions of Space Marines taking arms against one another. The noble Ultramarines are betrayed on Calth by the zealous Word Bearers bent on tearing down the Imperium. A dark ritual ignites the system’s star, sending both Legions underground to battle for their honor, their belief, the fate of the Imperium, or just to survive.

The Horus Heresy: Betrayal at Calth is a game of turn-based skirmishes between the genetically altered warriors of the 31st Millennium, The Adeptus Astartes. In the campaign, players control units of Space Marine Legionnaires, guiding them through the underground arcologies of Calth. Fight alongside units of Ultramarines ranging from Legionnaires, Veterans, Sergeants, Calth Defence Force, and Apothecary to elite units of Terminators, a Legion Moritat and the most venerable Contemptor Dreadnought. Dispatch the foul heretics of the Word Bearers using a mighty arsenal, from the ranged accuracy of Bolters, Plasma Guns, Flamers, and Rocket Launchers, to the close combat might of Chainswords, Power Fists, and Lightning Claws.

The Horus Heresy: Betrayal at Calth also includes several Multiplayer maps allowing players to fight as Ultramarines or Word Bearers in either objective based missions or deathmatch. Bring the full arsenal of your chosen Legion to bear against friends with private matches or against opponents across the world with built in matchmaking. Multiplayer mode is available to both PC and VR players, allowing both formats to play against one another.

DreamBack VR is a virtual reality, first-person psychological horror game where you explore the eerie Rickfford Mansion, trying to unravel its mysteries and survive the experience with your sanity intact.

HORROR LURKS WITHIN YOUR MIND

One fateful cold night, you were called by your company to repair a downed electrical power line in the Rickfford Mansion, an old Victorian estate in Mort Forest. That night scarred your life forever. Even though your memories of it are vague and hazy, you are still in shock months later, unable to sleep, and your relationship with your family is strained by the shock. You cannot recall what happened exactly on that night… What events terrified you so much that your mind just snapped and drew a curtain of oblivion over them? You are convinced that you have to face your memories and fears to overcome them. You then heard of a psychiatrist who claims to bring back memories through hypnosis, so you booked a consultation with him. Now, you are going to relive everything that happened in the house that night…

Will you survive your own memories?

TERROR IN YOUR OWN SKIN

Designed from the very beginning for Virtual Reality systems, DreamBack VR immerses you in a fully interactive and detailed environment. With its immersive movement and hand controls, you will have to navigate through the eerie Rickfford Mansion to solve its puzzles and enigmas through observation and intuition. DreamBack VR focuses its spine-chilling experience in atmospheric and psychological terror, without combat or action-oriented sections.

SEE. LISTEN. TREMBLE

Sometimes you have to see and listen for yourself to believe in the extraordinary… but you may wish you hadn’t. DreamBack VR is optimized to offer great visual quality without sacrificing any performance, with stable frame rates and adaptative graphic options. Its audio and sound have been designed to offer an incredibly immersive experience, with dynamic spatial and binaural audio, which, together with high-quality ambience sounds and effects, create a truly harrowing unique experience.

fc8b1830-61d0-49e6-b7f4-df431ba73077,Ayahuasca Kosmik Journey,"¥1,320","Description

In the jungle at night, a traditional ritual is taking place...
AYAHUASCA Kosmik Journey is a Virtual Reality film in which participants are immersed in visions triggered by a dose of ayahuasca. The spectator lives this through the eyes of director Jan Kounen as he goes on a spiritual voyage in the heart of the Amazon. For almost two decades, Jan has been traveling once a year to the Peruvian region of the Amazon, to meet indigenous healers and expand his knowledge of their traditional medicine. His wish is to share the intimate mystery of this experience with you.

Experience the magic and healing power of Ayahuasca...
Through the use of Virtual Reality, AYAHUASCA hopes to stay faithful to the original Shipibo tradition of consuming this plant as a transformative and meditative ritual. As such, the psychedelic journey will be guided by an indigenous South American shaman. 

Ayahuasca, the vine of the soul, and how to find your inner space...
Each virtual trip is its own experience, as different views and perspectives will reveal new ways of seeing and understanding. Tap into your inner sense of calm and lose yourself in the kosmik journey.

Motion sensors in the headset will allow the system to keep track of your movement and posture and react accordingly. The visions will either intensify or diminish, depending on movement and angles of viewing. 

AYAHUASCA has been internationally recognized at the following festivals:
Best Documentary Raindance 2019, Nominee at Tribeca 2019, Annecy 2019, Sandbox Qingdao 2019, BIFAN 2019, Kaohsiung 2019, Sonar 2019, Sitges 2019, MIFF 2019

eb588118-dcb2-425d-87d9-7257c67d55db,Guns'n'Stories: Bulletproof VR,"¥1,010","Description

Guns’n’Stories: Bulletproof is a dynamic VR western shooter that fully immerses players into the ambiance of weird Wild West.

Stepping the tangled storyline, you will encounter many intimidating but comical enemies and fight Big Bosses.

You will have to shoot aptly and a lot using both hands as well as to use various covers and move actively, avoiding bullets of enemies.

You will visit many beautiful locations and will be able to try a big arsenal of weapons under the rhythm of the western rock music, jokes, and cynical humor!



Full Immersion

Guns’n’Stories: Bulletproof is a full immersion into the ambiance of rollicking Westerns and shooting like flash from both hands, with cynical (and sometimes even black) humor.

Vivid Impressions

This is unforgettably vivid cocktail from emotions, in which we’ve added everything to make a player fall out of reality for a while to receive exactly these bright and fresh emotions we’ve only experienced when were kids.
The game will not make you bored even for a bit, constantly surprising you with its new story shifts, shootings, and various but unchangeably hilarious enemies.

Realistic and Dynamic

This is a persistent feeling of realism of what’s around and a possibility to be on Wild West. Though, a little bit Hollywood-style. 

The game will generously reward you for a desire to move actively – you can evade bullets, shut them down, and hide behind the objects while shooting back in your enemies.

Weapons and Environment

You will have an impressive spectrum of weapons (firearms, throwing weapons, and even futuristic arms) that will allow you to feel as an experienced shooter who is capable of dealing with hordes of attacking enemies alone.
You will visit lots of locations, every single one of which has been thoroughly thought-out and designed. 

Comfort

Along with that, the game is maximally comfortable and user-friendly. You will never feel sick or discomfort during the game.

However, you will need a good physical shape to play on the high level of complexity. So, we advise you to start from easy levels in order to receive more seamless gaming experience and get tired much lesser. There is nothing to be ashamed of!
(also playable on Oculus Rift)

In the year 2232, World War IV is coming to an end. Artificial intelligence turned against its creator, and every android was updated with a new directive: to eliminate humans.
Cities are abandoned, radiation levels are too high, and remaining people are slowly dying out. Some of the survivors are hiding in the Deadlands, ruins of ancient cities destroyed by previous nuclear wars, and are fighting back.
Mexico City arcology, once the global capital, is the ultimate goal. Deadly machines and androids protect the mainframe that controls the planet. Getting Mexico City back is the only chance of survival people have.
You are codenamed Blackbird, the first successful hybrid of human and machine. Tomorrow morning, in a desperate attempt to turn the tide of war, you will intercept a cargo train bound for Mexico City, infiltrate deep inside enemy territory and try to bring city defense systems down from the inside. 
Once resistance assault ships are inside, the ultimate battle for the future of humanity is set to begin.

Shattered Lights is a one-of-a-kind, fully roomscale based VR horror game which takes you on a journey down a seemingly abandoned underground medical facility armed with nothing but a flashlight and your sanity. 

Using non-euclidean geometry the game will immerse you into a world where every single step you take is purely physical and you’ll never once have to use controllers to move around, even so, you’ll still be able to explore intricate areas, impossible geometry and any situation that Shattered Lights will throw at you. 

Do Note:

Shattered Lights requires a play area of at least 2m x 2m (6 feet and 7 inches). There’s an option to play within a smaller space of 1.5m x 1.5m, but this is not recommended as it makes for a less stable experience, which some may experience as unpleasant.

Do you have a sentiment for games with little funny creatures that cause a lot of mayhem? Or maybe you like to feel in charge and do that on your own? We provide both of these things in Spuds Unearthed - a weird combination of action game, rts and moba.

Who are Spuds?
Spuds are potato-like hilarious creatures that love a good fight. In fact, they fough so much that they completely obliterated their mother planet - The Soil. Fragments of this planet have been scattered across the galaxy and now are habitated by rotten Zombuds - Spuds that went crazy after spending too much time on their own outside of the civilization.

However there are Spud heroes that have a mission of reuniting their civilization. The game starts after one of these heroes discovers the robotic AI hands on an abandoned planet that once was a home for many. This is where you come in! 

Gameplay
During the game you will learn to create new bizzare weapons that will help against the dangers lurking in the galaxy. You will travel to different planets trying to conquer them and free the Spuds that are still alive. You will find new Spuds heroes among them, that will join your cause and help to restore the civilization on your home planet.

You will use different Spuds heroes and their unique skills to battle against your enemies. Providing support from discovered and carefully crafted weapons will allow your Spuds to come home unharmed. You will be literally throwing everything you have at the enemy. There are many different turrets to choose from that support different playstyles and are useful in different situations.

Living galaxy
Other players will probably not allow to make your job too easy, as they will be creating their own Spuds tribes. Some of the Spuds are not particularly loyal and easily impressed, so if you lose a battle against other commander’s forces they will simply abandon you and relocate to his/her planet.

You will be fighting in an asynchronous mode, where the other players will fight against what you have left on the planet when conquering it earlier. Your Spuds population will determine you player level and collecting more Spuds will unlock new heroes and their upgrades.

Discover the dreams, fears and secrets of others—and leave your own for others to find.

In this award-winning social experience, human thoughts exist as sleeping creatures that can be awakened to reveal voice-recorded stories of other participants who were here before you. These anonymous stories are revealing and inspiring, encouraging reflection and introspection. To progress, you must leave your own stories behind for others to uncover

Visually beautiful and wholly transformative, Where Thoughts Go thematically explores the course of a lifetime through five simple questions written to dig deep. The voice recordings you hear are unique and unidentifiable, left by individuals from every walk of life, every age and every background. Participants have no way to discern who they are hearing from, only how considerate and sensitive each and every person is.

Unleash your strategy and get ready to defend your land – feel the responsibility for the fragile future of mankind and stand up for it with The Last Day Defense - VR tower defense game.

You find yourself in the middle of the persistent military conflict between two cosmic empires – both of them come from the Earth, both of them conduct R&D on time manipulation, and both are equally powerful in synthesizing necessary materials from any other ones by means of energy – the main source of the future civilizations. 
This struggle is ongoing for several centuries… but the enemy goes for a desperate and dangerous move – changing the course of history…
…They send their crew and a massive replicator (which can produce a diverse weapon, equipment, and machines out of nothing) to the past of the Earth, the cradle of civilization, to wipe out our ancestors and win the war in this dirty way.
Can you let this happen?
When the attack starts and our reality begins to collapse, the scientists find the turning point and send the temporal ship to prevent the disaster.
You're on board! Try your hand at being a temporal agent: challenge your brain by building defensive structures, destroy the enemy equipment, and give thought to the victory strategy, using a map of battles, a replicator, and the limited energy supply, which your team has managed to throw back to the past.
Use your brain and fighting skills to survive and save the whole empire from erasing.

Key Features:

* Difficulty  levels.  Do  you  want  to  relax  and  admire  the  scenery?  Or  are  you  ready  to  take  up  our  challenge  on  maximum  difficulty?*  It’s  up  to  you.
* Game  levels,  made  with  a  love  of  details.  You  will  like  to  examine  them! 
* Weather  effects  at  levels  designed  to  emphasize  and  complement  their  atmosphere.  
* Different  sizes  of  levels.  From  small  training  levels  to  truly  huge  and  complex  ones.  
* Time  for  completing  one  level  is  comfortable  for  VR.  You  won’t  have  time  to  get  tired.  
* 25  game  levels.
* 12  towers  are  divided  into  3  branches.  Each  of  them  has  its  strengths  and  weaknesses.  Explore  them  and  use  wisely!  
* 3  branches  of  modules  for  improving  towers,  3  levels  in  each.  Improve  the  characteristics  of  the  towers  when  the  operational  situation  requires. 
* The  landscape  that  affects  the  gameplay.  Consider  it  and  combine  it  with  features  of  the  towers.
* Sale  of  towers.  Commission  –  50%. 
* 32 various enemy units.
* Ranks  of  units.  It’s  easy  to  kill  a  newbie,  but  try  to  cope  with  a  veteran!
* A  fair  fight.  Units  can  also  attack  your  towers  and  disable  them.
* Regeneration  of  units.  Some  of  them  will  cause  more  troubles  than  others.  Better  kill  them  right  away.
* Combinations  of  towers.  Competent  planning,  teamwork,  and  no  magic!
* A  variety  of  waves  of  units.  Have  you  built  an  impenetrable  line  of  defense?  We  will  be  able  to  surprise  you!**
* Control  the  speed  of  the  game  process.  From  the  spectacular  slow  motion  mode  to  4x  when  re-completing.  The  “Moment  Stop”  mode  as  a  gift.
* The  scale  of  miniature  battles.  An  unexpected  combination  and  a  unique  experience  of  full  dive  in  VR.
* Just  play  the  way  you  like  it.  We  did  everything  for  a  comfortable  game  sitting,  standing,  and  playing  in  a  large  play  area.  Dynamic  adaptation  of  the  height  of  the  menu,  the  manual  change  of  the  height  of  the  table,  precise  mechanics  of  movement,  and  even  a  turn  of  the  world.
* Configure  the  game  to  suit  your  needs.  We’ve  collected  many  reviews  and  tried  to  give  you  the  opportunity  to  customize  the  gameplay  in  the  way  that  is  convenient  for  you.  Just  go  to  the  settings  menu.
* A  global  rating  table.  Can  you  get  into  the  Top  10?  And  in  the  Top  3?
* Achievements.  Everyone  loves  to  get  them  ;)  

Notes:

* – The  use  of  the  maximum  difficulty  level  can  lead  to  irreversible  damage  to  the  controllers,  helmet,  monitor,  as  well  as  any  interior  design  items  that  were  at  hand,  on  average  after  the  18th  unsuccessful  attempt  to  complete  the  level.
** – Use  the  maximum  difficulty  level  only  to  get  high-octane  thrills.

Organ Quarter is a VR survival horror game built from the ground-up for hand-tracked virtual reality. Explore labyrinthine environments, engage in tense combat, carefully manage your resources and solve horrifying puzzles in this homage to the slow, methodical survival horror experiences of the '90s.

-WHY VR?-
Horror in your personal space, as well as in the world outside. Horror you have to reach out to and touch. Organ Quarter leverages hand-tracked and room-scale VR to provide the most intense and unsettling experience possible.The sense of physical space and presence unique to the VR medium is carefully leveraged, pushing players past their comfort zone, bringing them into tight, claustrophobic environments and making them get up close and personal with monsters (who may not always be hostile...).

-HOW IS ORGAN QUARTER UNIQUE?-
This is not a wave shooter or a walking simulator – Organ Quarter is a long-form horror adventure. This is an experience that plays out over a large area over 5-8 hours, with intricately connected levels, gun combat, resources and tools at the player's disposal.

After an all-out war that took almost 2 millennia and claimed many lives of the Zen - Racket Fury Tournament emerged as the remedy to maintain peace in the Crown Galaxy. A fast-paced, strategic game that became an interplanetary phenomenon, bringing all the Zen together. As an aspiring Zen, you are challenged to join the most prestigious team that dominated the entire competition - the Division of Steel. Are you up for the challenge?

SINGLEPLAYER EXPERIENCE:
You’re about to face 4 members of the infamous Division of Steel per Cup. Beware! The higher the Cup, the more demanding and troublesome it gets!

CHALLENGING AI:
Thanks to a particularly advanced Artificial Intelligence in singleplayer, every opponent you’re going to play against will have their own temper and an utterly unique style of play.

EVER-GROWING CHARACTER:
Enhance your skills and become stronger with every match to be able to challenge the most renowned and agile representatives of the Division of Steel. 

MOCAP ANIMATIONS:
To deliver the most realistic characters’ movements, we relied upon motion capture data for our animations. The actors participating in the recording were in fact professional table tennis players, which translates each player’s swing into one, fluid motion and makes the rivalry as realistic as possible.

ADVANCED PHYSICS:
As expected in VR, our aim was to address the simulation aspect of the game to provide the real table tennis experience. We spent countless hours on developing our own physics from scratch. Based on scientific research, it’s extremely realistic and translates your moves in the most accurate manner.

WORKSHOP:
Each victory provides you with valuable assets that allow you to develop your unique character. The more skillful you become, the more admirable in your rivals’ eyes you become.

Failspace is a co-op, crisis-solving, multiplayer VR game where you have to nurture your fragile spaceship through the ever-changing dangers of space. Play alone or co-op up to 4 people at once in your own galactic adventure where you can expect everything to go wrong!

A spaceship is only as good as its crew! Failspace puts that testament to the test as you encounter different types of hazards when operating your spaceship. Comical and chaotic, each play session lasts around 10 minutes requiring tight co-op communication and fast fixing physical skills.

Try to complete cargo missions throughout the galaxy but remember that teamwork skills are crucial to become the best space trucker there is. So while your crew mate’s putting out a fire, go fix the shield or find out why the fire started.

A good crew delivers their cargo on time. A great space trucker crew delivers their cargo on time with their ship intact. Be vigilant! An experienced operator will detect and prevent catastrophic malfunctions before they even begin or manage the ship's resources to direct more energy to the warp drive to make the trip even faster. There’s never a dull moment in space delivery!

** The OASIS is expanding! Get the latest addition to Ready Player One: OASIS beta with the Elite Gunter Pack DLC! More levels; more bosses; more challenges. There's more to do in the OASIS.

The OASIS beta is inspired by the immersive virtual universe the OASIS from the film Ready Player One, which is set in the year 2045. In the Oasis beta’s ever-expanding universe, players are able to explore, compete in, and launch multiple VR experiences using their own custom avatars. Global leaderboards track the performance of all players as they earn points (coins) throughout the following experiences: Rise of the Gunters, Battle for the OASIS, Gauntlet and Smash.

•         Gauntlet - Navigate through a seemingly endless dungeon while the undead seek to destroy you. Collecting gold will improve your score and eating food will restore your health, but only your bow skills will ensure that you make it out alive. (Developed by Directive Games)

•         Battle for the OASIS - Help to save the OASIS by defeating waves of IOI Sixers. Advance through the trenches of Planet Doom towards the snowy planes that surround Anorak’s Castle. With an arsenal of potent firepower, you must stop the Sixers from controlling the fate of the OASIS. (Developed by Steel Wool Studios)

•         Rise of the Gunters - Fight against a nearly invincible army of highly trained IOI Sixers alone OR with up to two of your friends! Proceed with caution as you defeat Sixers, collect their coins, find power ups and survive a merciless onslaught of hyper-explosive kinetic action for as long as you can survive. The OASIS is yours. Take it back from IOI by yourself or with up to two fellow Gunters! (Developed by Drifter Entertainment Inc.)

•         Smash - Enhance your hand and eye coordination in this nod to James Halliday’s favorite `80's arcade games. (Developed by 2 Bears Studio)

•         Fracture - Heighten your spatial awareness and reflexes in this throwback to` 80's brick smasher games reimagined in VR. (Developed by 2 Bears Studio)

Play the game in Wands mode using two Vive or Rift controllers. From the main menu inside the Hotel Transylvania lobby, tap the 'Controller' button on the left to set up your controller.

Dive into the deep virtual waters and become a SeaWolf. Shoot your missiles and torpedoes at hostile submarines, minesweepers and tankers, actively avoid depth charges and enemy torpedoes, use defensive shield while trying to protect sea animals.

Think strategically, manage your ammo wisely, don't take unnecessary risks and try to survive to the last level and achieve the maximum score! If you dodge enemy attacks and eliminate all the enemies, you can advance to the next level. Beware that if you fail and lose your last life, you return to the beginning of the game.

Contains 10 levels:
- different difficulty, enviroments, attack formations
- limited time and ammo
- 3 lives for each level


SeaWolf VR is easy to operate, suitable for all ages, perfect for VR cafes. Train your reflexes, attention, composure, accuracy and concentration, enjoy adrenaline fun or just soak up the atmosphere of the underwater world.

This is the first game of independent developer 3DA, creator of educational apps Hindenburg VR, Great Pyramid VR and Blue Flame VR.
I plan to further develop and improve the game, I will appreciate all your ideas and suggestions! And if you like it, comment, share or shoot gameplay videos.

Inspired by a legendary shooter video game Sea Wolf by Midway, released in 1976.

Shooter's Island lets you train your FPS skills on a VR setup. This game will experience regular updates while in Early Access.

This aim trainer comes complete with tracking training to test your perception, and flick training to test your reflexes and precision. Work with a pistol, assault rifle, or sniper to take down dummy targets all over the island. To emulate your favorite FPS games, switch between real-world physics and hit-scan bullet action.

Geography is everything

Shooter's Island features several distinct areas where you can train. Check out the concrete jungle of a city, the evergreen forest, and the ominous volcano at the center of the island. For a simple trial, maybe start by seeing how well you do in The Pit, a small maze-like structure with dummy enemies around every corner.

Impressed with yourself?

After completing a trial, check your stats on the nearby panel to see how well you performed. Your accuracy and hit count are displayed here, so compete with yourself to see how much you can improve.

Shooter's Island can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses in FPS games, both in VR and other ports.

Enter the Yelvertons’ Victorian mansion and discover the eldritch reality of Lusst’ghaa - now in a more accessible Virtual Reality cut! Inspired by the works of Lovecraft and Zdzisław Beksiński, this psychological horror guides you through an intriguing plot filled with occult themes.

You receive a letter from your wife who has gone missing a year ago. Following the message, you head for a secluded mansion where an occult ceremony takes place. Gates to another world - the profane, perverse land of Lusst’ghaa are opened. Do you dare cross into the twisted realm of carnal ecstasy?

Welcome to Zephyrus, a world on the edge of logic and magic, full of witches, wizards, mysterious and cursed creatures. Become a magician and use your powers to escape this strange world. Discover the secrets of the world, solve puzzles and avoid creatures that get in your way. Prepare for a journey that will take you to places you've never been before, mysterious and challenging.

Solo and cooperative. Find your way through Zephyrus in single-player or LAN multiplayer mode. Collect and use mana to solve 3-dimensional puzzles. In cooperative play, sometimes more than one mage is needed to solve a challenge where you must act together at the same time.

Casting spells in certain places, such as by touching a floating rune, can lead to unexpected metamorphosis.

The creatures you meet in this world are all magical - curses, spells, anything possible...

Keep an eye out for hidden chests, who knows what you might find.

This game can also be played in co-op mode on a local network (LAN / Wifi) with any of our supported VR devices.

Comfort levels will vary for every player, and prolonged use can sometimes cause motion sickness and eye-strain. Please refer to your hardware’s safety guidelines before deciding whether VR is for you.

Add Caravan Palace - “Wonderland” to your song library
Just imagine a trip to a wonderful land, with candy and jam and ice cream!  Our unique Synth Riders Experience for this song invites you to step through a mysterious gate, see the wonders beyond and escape into a far away neon fantasy land!

About the Caravan Palace Pack
The Caravan Palace Pack will have you dancing to five of our favourite tracks from this “eccentric electronic” group from France.  Heavily influenced by the Gypsy scene, Django Reinhardt and the sophisticated orchestrations of 1940s jazz, Caravan Palace fuses this with elements of future bass, trap, deep house and African house.  Their resulting sound is a blend of past and future that is “joyfully nostalgic”.  Be sure to put on your dancing shoes for some of their best known, high energy hits such as “Lone Digger” and “Rock it For Me”, hugely influential for the electro-swing genre which they helped define, and finish the night with the dreamy, optimistic pop chaser of “Miracle”.

Also included in this pack is another unique Synth Riders Experience, and this time we’re taking you on a trip to Caravan Palace’s “Wonderland”!  Take the Experience Included with this track and you’ll step through a mysterious gate into a wonderful land - with candy, and jam, and ice cream!  Synth Riders Experiences are hand crafted animations inspired by and matched perfectly to the music that create a truly unique, immersive way to experience music.

Add Caravan Palace - “Miracle” to your song library
From their 2019 album “Chronologic”, this dreamy pop trip with a Middle-Eastern vibe reminds you of what’s important in life, that you need look no further than the present to find your joy, because every day is a miracle when you connect back to the love of those around you.

About the Caravan Palace Pack
The Caravan Palace Pack will have you dancing to five of our favourite tracks from this “eccentric electronic” group from France.  Heavily influenced by the Gypsy scene, Django Reinhardt and the sophisticated orchestrations of 1940s jazz, Caravan Palace fuses this with elements of future bass, trap, deep house and African house.  Their resulting sound is a blend of past and future that is “joyfully nostalgic”.  Be sure to put on your dancing shoes for some of their best known, high energy hits such as “Lone Digger” and “Rock it For Me”, hugely influential for the electro-swing genre which they helped define, and finish the night with the dreamy, optimistic pop chaser of “Miracle”.

Also included in this pack is another unique Synth Riders Experience, and this time we’re taking you on a trip to Caravan Palace’s “Wonderland”!  Take the Experience Included with this track and you’ll step through a mysterious gate into a wonderful land - with candy, and jam, and ice cream!  Synth Riders Experiences are hand crafted animations inspired by and matched perfectly to the music that create a truly unique, immersive way to experience music.

Story
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

Just kidding

But imagine yourself standing in magnet boots on top of the spaceship, overlooking a galaxy, equipped with 2 energysabers with built-in railguns, hearing this alien synth sound alarming you about the drones coming up in different shapes and styles. Be the masta of your sabers and your people. Protect yourself and protect them.

Game-play and features
You will appear on an alien spaceship with two energysabers in your hands in deep space somewhere in a faraway galaxy. You can use your energysabers as sabers, shields, or even railguns to fight with incoming flying and crawling drones. The drones are coming in waves and you will lose some health every time a drone hits you. The health is restored after each completed wave. In order to complete a wave you need to kill all the drones in it, and each subsequent wave has an increased number of drones. Every drone in a new wave becomes more and more tricky to kill: faster, closer to appear, harder to hit. They can also carry some hidden drones inside and split when you expect that the least.

Physical and mind activities
- 360 arm swings- 180 body rotation
- Squats
- Dodging lasers
- Precision training
- Attention exercising
- Spaceship walking if you have enough room

Good luck!
It's a VR deep-space experience. It's a survival game.

It was a time of.. robots reading books! Sadly, all of the printing presses are damaged and they miss single words from each new book. As a new recruit to Ro-Books bookstore, it's your job to make words to complete a book for each customer. You'll need to serve all of the customers before the day is up, or else it's game over! Can you make enough words in time? Can you solve anagrams in the bonus rounds?

Paper Jam! puts you inside a bookshop, meeting a diverse range of customers in either a career mode - where you get to uncover the story of the robots - or in a quick game mode where you can climb your way up the global leaderboards.

If you love word games, Paper Jam! may be a game you'll love to play as much as we loved making it! This is one of the first ever VR word games, which means it's both a physical and a mental game. You will need to use two hands to operate the typewriter to make words with so, as you're having a great time, remember to look after yourself and take breaks if you start to feel tired.

Endurium is a VR arcade style defense game designed to test your reflexes as you progress from light cardio to light-speed against wave after wave of beam drones and plasma blade wielding bots.

•Focused on freeform combat
Like a rhythm game, but without the rhythm. Instead, pace fluctuates randomly moment to moment and you are free to destroy most beams with either hand then return fire when the opportunity strikes and take out the drones that fire those beams! Deflect blaster bolts and engage in fierce melee combat!

•Level Up
Earn credits as you progress that you can spend to increase the number of hits you can take, the length of your blades, the damage caused by your energy waves, or even the time-dilation that occurs when you take damage. Earn credits even on a loss, so there's never a reason to go back in difficulty - continue to push yourself and face ever intensifying challenge! Additionally, clearing levels unlocks equipment modules that enhance or alter your abilities!

You will be catapulted into a dream of swords and notes: perhaps a drummer who dreams of samurai or perhaps the opposite. Cut as much as you can and you'll unintentionally compose some crazy experimental electronic drum tracks while practicing like a real swordsman.
This is the complete version of the DDSAMURAI game with 6 different modes of launch and behavior of the targets / notes (proposed in easy, medium and hard level) and 3 crazy modes to increase the fun. Train like a samurai warrior while slicing the musical signs you form electronic drum sounds thus playing experimental music!!!

Time Hacker is an addictive VR game where your creative ability is what gets you through the levels. Your only weapon is the power to stop time. That means, like Marvel’s Quicksilver, you can enjoy playing with the scene while your enemies are effectively frozen.

- An unlikely hero with an unusual power
In a laboratory where intelligent and powerful robots are under development, a failure suddenly occurs. This transforms the seemingly innocuous machines into bloodthirsty agents of evil. But you have a secret weapon: the ability to stop time momentarily. Use your precious seconds of frozen time to make small but critical changes, then, when the normal flow of time is restored, watch as the hilarious chaos unfolds.

- A god of manipulation
Take “possession” of the robots, then manipulate them into annihilation. To ensure every last one of those evil machines is put to rest though, you’ll also need to make clever changes to the scene.

- Create a glorious “chain of destruction”
Explore the immersive VR environment, then set up “booby traps” that will lead to satisfying “conclusions.” Blow up flammable barrels and explosive cylinders. Break chains, rescue hostages, dodge shots, change the direction of cars and cranes, place dynamite, shockers, and more. Make sure you get all the robots though, because if you don’t, you’ll be the one who ends up dead.

- Train a devious mind
Time Hacker currently features more than 40 exciting levels of varying difficulty. Go through the easy levels to build up your abilities and learn the basic controls. Gradually unlock more difficult levels as you progress. To complete the most difficult levels, you’ll need to carefully plot a sequence of glorious destruction. To do so, you’ll need both mastery of the controls and sharp (and devious) mind.

- Sandbox Mode
Time Hacker also comes with “Sandbox Mode,” where you can place bots, cars, explosives, and any other items at will. Here, the sky's the limit on your creative destruction.

Face Your Demons is the game that combines the action of the shooter with magical and psychological atmospheres. In the spaces of your mind you will travel through dark forests, mist-shrouded moors and fantastic architecture to face your demons. This game transforms the act of shooting into something that is no longer made to kill or do violence but to symbolically get rid of one's anguish and fears, symbolized by the monsters / living masks who will be your opponents in this adventure.

Become one with your rocket skates

Imagine having a rocket booster strapped to your hands and a hot pair of roller skates on your feed. 
There is a mountain road in front of you and all you can think about is racing downhills with rocket power.
The premise might be simple but the fun is guaranteed.

Let’s mix it up

If just racing downhills with rocket power is not enough for you you can try one of many different game modes that will mix up
the experience. Here are a couple of examples:

Time to Rage
- A rocket booster on one hand and a baseball bat in the other is all you need to destroy any target that comes your way.
You are the destruction!

Aim and Shoot
- A rocket booster on one hand and a gun in the other - I mean what else would a crazy rocket guy bring to a mountain rally? 
Be ready to aim and shoot! 

Rocket Rush
- What could be more awesome than rockets? Right, more rocket! 
Because double the speed makes up for twice the fun!

It’s the beginning of June 1944. Five years since the start of World War II, the Third Reich continues their occupation of Europe. Allied forces decide to open a so-called “second front” in Western Europe to turn the tides of war. Operation Overlord – the biggest landing operation in history – is about to start. General Eisenhower sets June 6th as D-Day. Joint forces of American, British, and Canadian troops get ready to land on the Normandy coast. You are among the soldiers about to change the fate of the world.

From two unique perspectives, experience the largest landing operation in martial history regarding the forces and means used. Take on the role of an airborne division jumper who descends into enemy territory to destabilize the enemy troops under the cover of night. Alternately, become a soldier beginning their heavy crossing of Omaha beach on D-Day.

Complete diversified military missions, from short- and long-range skirmishes with Nazis, by employing anti-aircraft fire, destroying enemy tanks, and breaking through the trenches and escaping from a POW camp. Use over a dozen weapons typical to the World War II period that have been accurately reproduced in terms of appearance and mechanics.

Finish the campaign and practice your skills on the shooting range, which offers four different gameplay modes. Once ready, unlock Hardcore Mode, which will take your cleverness, strategic thinking, and will to survive to the extreme.

Tyrell, a high-level Archangel from heaven, was accidentally shot down in the battle with the devil Mephisto, and was sealed in the sewer of the abyss of sin by the power of the devil's bone prison. Due to the severe loss of spiritual power in the battle and the loss of light blade, the fighting angel had to use the wings sent by the Druid of the strong wind to trek hard. He must always pay attention to lurking in the journey like a sharp water pipe. At the same time, he should try his best to collect square hole copper coins containing the mysterious power of the ancient east to enhance his strength and belief, For every 30 copper coins you get a chance to revive.

It's a long way to go. There is darkness ahead. The dream in his heart and the copper coin in his pocket are the only belief that supports him to go on. However, where is the light, whether the angel alliance has resisted the attack of hellhounds, whether yizuer's army of ghouls has spread to the end of the universe, whether the city has been completely filled with evil souls, and whether the health code can still work in the next refuge.

No, no more wishful thinking, these thoughts will only make your hands and feet cold, shaking all over, and finally unable to flap your wings. Clench your upper and lower teeth tightly, wave the handle with both hands synchronously, fan the wings of the wind Druid, advance, advance by any means

c5dfd01d-2c3c-4fdd-a4b9-49bfb1a73c72,Quest for Runia,¥999,"Description

In Quest for Runia you explore one of the most beautiful, spectacular and calming places in the universe - with gushing waterfalls, buzzing airships and glittering diamonds.
Everything could be perfect, if there wasn’t that mean little wizard Karos, who has cast a spell over Runia. Karos needs Runia's beauty - its magic crystals - for his evil magic powers and wants to destroy Runia.
Numerous cursed barriers block the way to the Castle of Karos.
Help Runia to keep its beauty and free it from Karos and his evil magic by breaking all the barriers!

The gameplay is based on a mix of classic Match-3 and well-known bubble shooters.
Each level is a three dimensional structure, built of cubes of different color. They resemble objects, like e.g. a fish, but also geometric interesting and hard to solve mazes.

You have to cast a new cube into the structure from the magic wand. If it creates a chain of three or more cubes of the same color, the cubes will pop.

In Runia there is no time limit, but you have a fixed number of shots to clear the 3D structure barriers. Your aim is to find the most effective way to solve the puzzle by destroying as many cubes as possible with one shot and clear the entire barriers.

Earn three stars in every level by finding the most effective way to finish it.

Dissolve the magic barriers blocking the way to defeat the evil mage Karos in this funny puzzle exploration bubble shooter!

Features:
- Relaxing seated VR gameplay
- Seven beautiful environments
- 165 levels with various difficulty
- Special cubes with fun mechanics, e.g.
   -  Bomb – removes all cubes in the explosion radius
   - Lightning bolt – removes all cubes in one direction
   - Slime cube – will spread slime to neighboring cubes
   - …and many more!

84a6abc5-c714-413d-b5c2-47f0141a3a38,Sam & Dan: Floaty Flatmates,¥420,"Description

Oh nooo, the world is flooded! Oh no, there is also a really big shark! You are a survivor of the apocalypse, stuck in your apartment, all by yourself, so sad... Across the street there is another survivor. Let's wave to each other, work together, and both reach the boat to get to safety!

Sam & Dan: Floaty Flatmates is a co-op VR game where communication and teamwork is key.
You are playing as Sam or Dan, one of the two survivors trapped in your apartment because of a major world flood.
Your buddy is trapped in a different building across the street, work together to get supplies to build a bridge towards a boat.
Find tools to make communication easier, like a tin can, that can be used as a can phone.
Also, avoid falling in the water, there’s a big shark!

Please note: 
This game is best played with a friend because it's multiplayer-only there might be moments when it's hard to find a random player to play co-op with.
You can share your account with a friend in VR to invite them to play. 
Sam and Dan is best played without any external communication, some of the in-game puzzles are best enjoyed with non-verbal communication. 

Co-op is the main mode of the game. You start in the middle of the apocalyptic storm. You start with nothing, search for weapons and tools in order to build the bridge, and make a new apocalypse buddy! A completed game can take up to an hour to finish. When you've reached the end there is still time for some easter egg hunting.

Versus mode is all about murder, quickly build a bridge before your enemy does, so you can reach the bow and start firing arrows into his face.
Rounds are quick, practice your aim.

9e57667e-9e05-435c-89f0-295c216aa5c2,A Very Bad Christmas Eve,¥520,"Description

'Twas the night before Christmas, and Santa just left,
One elf alone, feeling bereft;
All of a sudden, a beeping did sound,
The machines were all breaking, but no one’s around! 

His workboots he donned,
His toolbox was packed;
‘Twas up to him to save Christmas,
His knuckles he cracked!

******
A Very Bad Christmas Eve is a single-player action-adventure puzzle game from Incineration Productions exclusively made for the VR platform.

It is Christmas Eve. Santa Claus has just flown off with his sleigh, leaving the most magical workshop in the world. Not so long after he left, all of the elves went straight home and tucked in for the night. Except you. You play as the last Elf who still hasn’t left Santa’s workshop. Imagine yourself on a rocking chair in front of a burning fireplace, completely undisturbed, finishing the last sips of a rich hot chocolate. The lights are dimmed, Christmas lights are twinkling, you are enjoying the sounds of wood crackling in the fireplace. You can hear your favourite Christmas tracks playing from a distant old radio. Then, all of a sudden, an alarm starts to ring. You jump out of the chair and see that one of Santa’s machines has broken down. Then you realise that you are the only elf who can save Christmas. But can old St.Nick really count on you?

There are four critical machines in Santa’s workshop. You better fix them, all, on time, because even if one fails, Christmas will be ruined. Except if you don’t want to save Christmas…

The machines are as follows:

RPS - Reindeer Positioning System
Chimney Lube Diffusion System
Emergency Gift Delivery System 
+ Unstable Wrapping Paper Materialisation Unit
+ Tubular Gift Dispenser
+ Wrapping Paper Pneumatiser
Time dilation System

The world of Yoren is is a dangerous place filled with mystical creatures, witches and ghouls. You are a lone bounty hunter collecting runes to become the strongest mage of Yoren.
Your journey starts at your hideout deep within Yoren's icy mountains. Here you can safely practice your magic against the dummies in the practice field, or craft potions and wands at your very own forge.

Before you start looting and exploring the fallen kingdoms and dungeons of Yoren looking for special artifacts and runes you've got to be prepared for anything or anyone crossing your path. All around the world of Yoren are crystals growing. Perfect for brewing potions, or crafting wands. Discover new recipes, ingredients and spells along the way.

Combat, spell casting & runes
Yoren uses cutting-edge VR technology for spell casting. Draw rune shape gestures to select and cast spells, each with their own individual sign and ability. Yoren aims to make use of the newest VR technology, such as the pressure sensitivity in the Valve Knuckles controllers. No button pressing, just squeeze lightly in the controller to activate your spell.

Dungeons & fallen kingdoms
After you've brewed your potions, it's time to enter the dungeon. In Yoren there are several dungeons and fallen kingdoms. In these areas you can collect area-specific loot, and encounter it's boss. With each dungeon or kingdom you beat, you learn a new rune. Each rune has it's own element for example water, fire and blood. Each element has it's own advantages. Some may be more focused on healing, whilst others are far more aggressive depending on your play style.

This is the moment it’s all been leading up to. Those years watching your team, idolising the players, collecting the stickers, playing shoot-outs in the park and mud soaked local league games. Never did you think it would come to this, stood in front of the goal with the weight of years of practice, of team-mates, of heartache and pure joy, on your shoulders. This is the moment forged in passion. Rezzil Index Lite, your soccer practice, on demand. 

Rezzil Index Lite puts you in the soccer boots of elite players. Built with Rezzil’s professional level VR simulation technology used to train pros in clubs around the globe, the game features ‘real world’ drills and challenges. Whether you choose to take on the world or destroy your best friend’s score in local party mode, Rezzil’s pro level simulation will astound you with its authenticity and accuracy - VR soccer just got real. 

Rezzil Index Lite requires at least 1 Vive Tracker, although we highly recommend 2 for the full experience.

Finishing Challenge
This is the beautiful game in its purest form. Take your place on the pitch and score as many goals as you can in heated 30, 60 or 90 second rounds. Be fast but be precise and slam those top bins in. Fancy a more casual session? No problem switch to endless mode for a fun crossbar challenge or just play at your own pace.

With physics and ball control honed by top clubs, you can smash the ball first time, take a touch or control the ball for more accuracy. You can even freestyle if you like, with every touch of the ball, every action, every kick feels amazingly realistic.

Color Combos
Upgrade your Rezzil Index Lite experience with ‘Color Combos’, one of Rezzil’s most popular drills used by elite players around the world. Simply hit the correctly colored balls with the side of your boot the game commands. It seems simple but as the pace quickens the pressure ramps up in this rapid-fire test of body and mind. You want harder? You want faster? Then push the limits higher and add modifiers to create a drill that would have the pros gasping for breath!

Gear Up
Open up your locker to view a variety of [b]genuine Adidas boots[/b] and balls available to purchase to enhance your Rezzil Index Lite experience. Why not slip on the latest Predator Mutators and bang in the official Mexico 86 ball? Build up stats for achievements and XP to unlock new in-game kit and bragging rights. 


Rezzil Index Lite Features:
Train like a pro - play with the same VR simulation technology being used to coach elite soccer athletes around the world.
FREE Finishing Challenge with 3 time limits - 30, 60 or 90 seconds.
FREE Endless mode lets you take on the Finishing Challenge at your own pace or a more casual practice session.
Upgrade your Rezzil Index Lite experience with the add on ‘Color Combos’ drill taken straight from the pro level system.
Play ‘Color Combos’ with a time limit for an intense mind and body soccer workout.

Awoken in the night by your doll. Speaking as if it possesses a mind of its own, it warns you of a monster that has taken a liking to your fear.
Survive each night as the monster tries to eat you, hiding in the shadows, waiting patiently for you to make a mistake.

[You do not need to have played the first game to play number 2. They both have their separate stories.]

• Learn the Boogeymans hiding places. Watch them carefully.

• Lights will be broken one by one making it darker each night.

• Batteries will only last so long. Conserve as much power or risk trying to charge them up.

• Weather will change each night, affecting the way you play. Rain will drown out noise, lightening will give you quick glimpses of the room in full light, snow blizzards will make it impossible to hear much at all.

2c9060ea-2661-4254-93d1-02ece0f6f696,QUANERO 2 – SYSTEM RELEASE,Free,"Description

Imagine you are a detective in the future, with the best surveillance system ever developed. You can reconstruct crime scenes in virtual reality, move freely and manipulate the time to carry out your investigations.

About the game:

In our first VR project (Quanero VR) we’ve combined time manipulation with a VR-Story. You were able to slow down time, reverse it or bring it to a halt. Quanero 2 offers a similar experience, but a much bigger world for you to explore. Observe and connect the dots, to get to the bottom of it all!

Background Information
The work on ""Quanero 2 - System Release"" stopped in 2018. All participants finished University and went to work in different jobs in different countries. Sadly Q2 never got finished. The project was too ambitious for a small inexperienced team. Some game mechanics were flawed the begin with and there was no cohesive logic behind it. We decided to strip Q2 of it's main gameplay mechanics and release a version of the game that resembles the first episode of Quanero. We still really hope you like it, have fun with it and can recognize the potential of VR storytelling. So go ahead and try it - you might like them choppy animations!

A VR Psychological Horror Experience.
After having checked into a haunted hospital, you are being confronted with its evil resident who is not too pleased about your visit.

You are trapped in a wheelchair, unable to move anything other than your head.
This might sound like a less interactive experience, yet this decision in game design makes the experience even more claustrophobic.

The VR experience is designed to adapt to user reactions and actions. Even though there are no active game objects to interact with, events are depended on head movements, speeds and viewing angles. Sound, noise, shadows, explosions and lights distract viewers and help guide their views in certain directions.

By guiding viewers attention and adapting to their behaviour, each users will face a unique experience in both, length and in intensity.

Psychological Horror Experience. No immediate violence is shown, references only.

The Experience has an average length of about 10 minutes.

An exhilarating journey into altered states of consciousness, powered by your own voice. Explore a hypnotic world of light, color, and sound. Emergent music harmonizes with you, as you navigate through strobing tunnels-of-light, impossible shapes, and deep into a meditative trance.

More than guided meditation... less than a handful of psilocybes. SoundSelf is the collision of centuries-old mindfulness wisdom with the videogame trance. It's an exhilarating journey into altered states of consciousness powered by your own voice.

Use your voice to explore a hypnotic world of sounds and visuals that feel like they are coming directly from your body. Emergent music harmonizes with you, as you navigate through strobing tunnels-of-light, impossible shapes, and deep into a meditative trance.

Measured by cognitive neuro-scientists to produce transcendent states of consciousness. SoundSelf is an elegant symmetry of image, sound and body that takes advantage of loopholes in the way you perceive to facilitate a new experience of yourself and your world. Read the study here: https://www.enterandromeda.com/ss-science

Dim the lights, turn up the volume, and let your voice guide you through an odyssey of color and sound that dissolves your mind in a bath of ecstatic sensation.

fea798f8-3f4d-4828-a86e-4d96798f8160,Escape Room VR: Inner Voices,"¥2,050","Description

Tune yourself to the voices lurking in the head of John Blake - the tormented man dwelling in a trap that only you can guide him out of. You will never know whether what you see is real - and you can be sure that even after you’ve escaped the trap, not all had been discovered. You will continuously be searching for a way to escape the randomized maze of rooms, new voices will haunt you, and you will be the one deciding who dies.

Meet John and his past in possibly the only adventure game with a non-linear plot procedurally generated user path, and (more than) a pinch of the atmosphere of your favorite horrors.

OBJECTIVES

- NON-LINEAR storyline.
- Intriguing, disquieting gameplay due to the ever-changing randomized maze.
- Unique, dark atmosphere inspired by the works of H.P.Lovecraft, E.A.Poe and S.King.
- An amazing experience thanks to the moody soundtrack and audio design
- Addictive story full of plot twists and choices that may lead you to one of 5 different ending
- A possibility of enjoying the game in 4 different cinematic languages: English, Polish, Turkish and Russian
- Engaging puzzles with different levels of complexity

Once signed, the Protocol must be promptly implemented.
Have a nice day!

Plot
The action of Protocol, most likely, takes place in the near future. You are a flippant soldier who signs up for the Protocol program implementation. Packed in a landing box and dropped off somewhere in the Arctic Circle, not far from the Terminus research complex, your main objective is to follow a mysterious AI's orders, who uses you to make """"first contact"""" within the Protocol program framework. Any deviation from AI's orders is considered to be a violation of Protocol; leading to the elimination of the complex and staff.

Features
Protocol is a sci-fi comedy with a hint of horror, action and a twisted love story.
Uncover an intriguing plot filled with conspiracies, plot twists, countless expletives, dark humour, and some light-hearted mockery.

Have a Nice Day!
This is a phrase you will love AND hate because you have violated the Protocol AGAIN. If you think that hardcore is when you can defeat the biggest bosses, then try not to die when taking a snowball.

Genre ambiguity
We still can't decide which genre suits this game. Adventure? Puzzle? Shooter? Immersive sim (seriously?)? Walking simulator? Crazy trip? Or, maybe... All in one?

Brain vs Zombies is a puzzle shooter VR Game from Joy Way. You must solve physical puzzles to kill each level’s enemies.

You wake up in a room full of avocado-shaped zombies. It seems you are part of an experiment to see if you have what it takes to eliminate the zombies. The only way to stay alive is to kill them all, but you have a limited number of bullets in your gun. You’ll need to turn on your brain to make it through the increasingly complex puzzles.

The zombies do not always need to be shot directly. Instead you’ll need to calculate the rebound trajectory, blow something up, shoot at various mechanisms, push one dummy into another, open and close doors, use portals and so on.

95ad19af-afd2-44de-9eb5-55555c19731f,Change Ranger Demo,Free,"Description

Change Ranger, developed by Joy Way Games, is a new first person shooter and puzzle game in virtual reality. In each level of the game you’re given a limited period of “frozen time” in which you must alter the scene just enough to result in the destruction of your enemies when time starts flowing normally.

Each level in the game consists of three phases:

1. Time flows at normal speed. The location is filled with enemies who rush to kill you. They are just about to pull their triggers or otherwise bring rain death upon you when...

2. Time stops. This is your chance to save yourself by cleverly altering the scene. You can, for example, strategically change the direction of an enemy’s pointed gun. During this phase, a timer shows you exactly how many seconds you have until time returns to normal.

3. Time is restored to normal. You are instantly transported back to the original position of your body and your enemies continue on whatever trajectory and with whatever momentum they had before time stopped. If you’ve managed to make the right changes while time was frozen, your enemies will be simultaneously destroyed and you’ll move on to the next level unscathed. However, if you’ve miscalculated, you’ll suffer the wrath of your enemies’ vastly superior firepower.

In Change Ranger, each level presents you with increasingly complex challenges and offers you an increasing variety of tools at your disposal. The deviously clever alterations you’ll need to make while time is frozen include redirecting a car, arming a bomb, strategically opening or closing a door, directing an enemy’s hand to a lever that triggers the devastating fall of a weight, and positioning an object to result in a deadly bullet or shrapnel ricochet.

Make sure you get it just right though because if your changes don’t manage to result in the complete destruction of your enemies, you’ll be the one who ends up dead when time starts flowing again!

~ Characters: SpellPunk features a full body avatar, which will increase the immersive experience making you feel like a real magician yourself and places you right in the magical duel.

~ Ranked matchmaking: Compete online for sweet victory and ranking on the Leaderboards.

___________ ! ___________

Please note that SpellPunk VR is in Early Access. 

SpellPunk is a VR game with huge potential and although at the current stage of its development the game is fully playable with 1v1 matchmaking game mode featuring 8 full body avatars, 5 battle arenas and 10 different spells, we strongly believe that we can give our players a much deeper experience. As SpellPunk is a multiplayer game, we want to get the community on board and playing it as soon as possible. This will allow us to determine the direction we want to take SpellPunk into and get that oh so important PvP balancing done just right. We are willing to develop the game with the community as our co-pilot, because the single most important thing to a multiplayer game is the players playing it.

The full version of SpellPunk will feature new customisable avatars, battle arenas, new game modes including 2v2, 3v3 and daily challenges and many new spells. We plan to roll out bi-weekly updates to the game with new and exciting content, as well as balance changes based on the community feedback we receive.

We have fun stuff planned like developer blogs, online sessions, chats, and much, much more. Our team will appreciate the time you put in playing SpellPunk and the advice you will be giving, so we promise you to take your feedback and ideas into consideration, because we truly believe that this will lead to a game we will all be proud of.

We believe in giving advantages to our early supporters, so we intend to increase the price of SpellPunk when we release the full version of the game later this year. It is unnecessary to mention that players who join us during the Early Access period will have access to the full version of the game no matter how large it grows with time.

If you’ve always wanted to watch and influence a game's design process from its early access ‘till the official release and share the dream of a first person VR experience in which you will be able to cast spells by drawing magical symbols in the air with your own hands, then do it by being part of our Early Access. We will be happy to have you on board!

3cb7fa9c-a62d-4033-a032-67f9c294901c,Ultimate Fishing Simulator - Amazon River DLC,¥520,"Description

Amazon - one of the longest rivers in the world, although some say that it is the longest river! It is home to many unique fish species that would love to hunt for your juicy bones!

The river bed, stretching for thousands of kilometers (in the game ""a little"" less), changes its character. It is winding and simple, slow and wild! This should be a wild river to ensure an unforgettable adventure for anglers.

Numerous tree trunks and branches can be dangerous for your boat, so in this DLC you get a new, flat-bottomed motorboat - for quick movement between your favorite places!

In the Amazon, you will have the opportunity to catch catfish, piranhas or cichlids. However, real monsters such as Arapaima, Payara and Electric Eel are waiting for the bravest anglers!

a16ef67c-4d7c-44af-9e4b-fc74ecd1f169,Boiling Steel: Preface,Free,"Description

You are one of many who set off in search of a better life in the distant bastion of scientific progress. Your goal is a colony planet, free from bureaucratic, religious and other radical restrictions.

Here they research and freely use industrial teleportation, transfer of consciousness and other technologies prohibited in the inhabited worlds. Factories, power plants, mines and residential complexes of the planet are fully automated. All the dirty and hard work is done by robotic shells controlled by the operator’s mind. It is a high-tech paradise. But here, something went wrong.

As soon as you wake up from a long sleep in a capsule of hibernation, you fall into circulation. Radical fanatics are here too. A virus was launched into information networks that turned robots into aggressive death machines. The paradise planet plunged into the chaos of war. The inhabitants of the colony took the seats of the operators of robotic shells and sent their army of robots into battle. Joint efforts have borne fruit.

The virus is localized, stripping is approaching the final phase. But the “robot riot” is just the tip of the space-iceberg that the planet has encountered. Everything that happens next goes beyond understanding and plunges the planet into utter darkness.

Your hibernation capsule is stuck in quarantine on an orbital station. But this is not a time to relax. Control the robotic shell of an engineering department directly from orbit! Immerse yourself in the thick of events and witness the inexplicable global cataclysm. Guess its nature and save the planet. But first, survive yourself.

Boiling Steel is a Sci-Fi VR shooter with an intriguing storyline.
- A unique system for quick reloading weapons adds drive and gives a unique gaming experience.
- Nine different tools with original mechanic of two-handed grip allow the player choose their own playing style.
- The weapon upgrade system automatically improves a favorite and frequently used tool, gradually turning it into a hellish machine.
- The ability to enhance selected parameters of the robotic shell adapts the gameplay for the player.
- Randomly generated biomes and dangers make each new playthrough unique.
- Thoughtful story missions reveal the gloomy secrets of the planet and keep the intrigue to the very end.
- Realistic graphics are completely immersed in the exciting reality of the fantastic world of the future.
- A minimum of 10 hours of gameplay, even for experienced players.

Welcome to the Boiling Steel universe! Explore, fight and share your impressions. The opinion of each player is important to our team.

And remember, a tool on overdrive is cooler than any weapon.

ArtPulse offers an artistic VR sandbox to play and express your creativity in. Spawn and combine shapes, colors, and freehand painting to sync them seamlessly into the background music. You don’t need to be an experienced artist or musician to make cool stuff, but you can just create and let the game elevate it!

Each shape and color emits a different sound, which will sync with the background song that the player chooses. Having no rules allows you to do whatever you want to. Fly around spawning shapes or create a tree in the colors of a rainbow. 


Features
-6 base songs (for now!) to create a soundscape on
-A toolkit full of unique visuals and sound effects
-A color wheel to select different tunes
-Customizable cinematic, endless and time-limited modes
-Free flying movement

WELCOME TO PURGATORY ISLAND...
A prison for the undead and dying. A hell from which you will never escape.

If you’re reading this, you’ve likely found that the nuances of life are slowly leaving you. One breath at a time. One paused heartbeat within your chest.

The Far Watchers own this diseased island and have infected you with their Animus, a machine that holds you together, and one that aims to kill the death inside you! They’ve created this hell to test you, their weapons, and all their other damnable creations. Their cameras both seen and unseen track your every movement throughout this swamped and accursed place, and their flitting shadows move just beyond the edge of observation. They have given you a second life, and it is for you to find out how and why.

Features:

    Solve mysteries while trying to survive!
    Story written by Mark Rein-Hagen (Vampire: The Masquerade, I AM ZOMBIE).
    The game supports Virtuix Omni, Cyberith, Hardlight WIP and Oculus Touch.

The Story

In 2016, The NASA New Horizons space probe identified a fleet of alien ships heading towards Earth. Having tracked the many previous sightings and abductions taking place over the years, world leaders have determined that the approaching fleet are sinister in nature. It is projected that their fleet will arrive sometime in late 2017.
 
In response to this global crisis, the US military was forced to disclose a top secret military project they had created during the Cold War. The DH125 is a military defense robot that was secretly deployed into orbit during the US Star Wars Initiative. The DH125 is unique in that it contains alien components retrieved from the Roswell crash in 1947 and is the only weapon we have to defend our planet.
 
The DH125 was secretly retrieved and modernized to prepare us to defend our planet. It is the only defense we have and can only be remotely operated by one person. Now the global leaders of the world have declared a world emergency and have initiated a program to find the one person capable of manning the DH125. World leaders have called upon VR Visio to create a simulation designed to test a person’s skills, reflexes and precision.
 
Are you the one who will lead us to victory? Do you have the skills to defend our planet? Download the game on Steam now and find out if you are the one.

""In 1956, a nine years old child died in the psychiatric hospital of Santa Benedetta Martire. Her name was Allison. While alive, Allison wrote a personal diary, which is said to contain the truth about her past and the creepy life at the hospital. The diary was never found. 
A few years later, the hospital was shut down, and became a terrifying, god-forsaken place. You are Guglielmo Carter, a dauntless reporter interested in finding Allison's diary and revealing its hidden secrets.""

Drunk or Dead, a new crazy indie zombie shooter. You are caught by zombie apocalypse caused by a virus, which affects only sober people. If you want to stay alive, you have to drink and shoot zombies

Drinking has its own mechanics. If you are close to sober you shoot accurately. When you get more drunk, your accuracy drops, but time begins to run slower. 
You have a scale that measures your drunkenness (also HP because you get sober when zombies hit you). If you get too drunk or too sober - you loose.
When you kill zombies you get points, amount of which depend on your drunkenness level.

a13d48b3-a439-4500-a61e-dbbae58dce33,Beer and Skittls VR,¥205,"Description

Inspired from old Finnish skittles game Kyykkä, Beer and Skittls is a strategic VR game that will challenge your skill level of throwing.

HOW TO PLAY

Rules are simple. You need to get exactly 100 points to win. 
In order to do this, you need to throw the bottle on your right, to the colored bottles on the floor.
Different colored label bottles give you different points. Such as:
Green label: 1 point
Blue label: 3 points
Brown label: 5 points
Black label: 9 points

EXACTLY 100!

If your total score passes 100, your score will be halved!
If you cheat and throw from outside the throwing area, your score will also be halved.
Try to get to 100 with least throws as possible.

Beer and Skittls VR is powered by Unreal Engine 4.

Playthings was made to welcome anyone to the world of virtual reality. Built for the HTC Vive, Playthings puts virtual drumsticks in your hands and sets you loose on a musical playground from another world. There's no complicated buttons or tutorials--everyone knows how to use drumsticks. But drums are for real life. In Playthings, the instruments are made out of food: like hot dog xylophones and jelly bean harps. With the HTC Vive's room scale motion tracking, you don't need a joystick to explore the world of Playthings--you move around with your own two feet. Playthings transforms even the tiniest room into a tropical dreamscape that stretches forever in every direction. You can make all sorts of music with your snacks. Or, you can rearrange them with the Golden Tongs to make your own singing food sculptures. You can swing the Giant Hammers to relieve stress (or just make a big mess). There's lots more tools and worlds to discover--all you have to do is take a look around.

Features:
5 explorable worlds full of interactive musical food that anyone can play.
3 different pairs of drumsticks with unique powers.
Intuitive, languageless, tutorial-free controls.
Secret Rhythm Game mode! (shhh)
Features an original soundtrack written by Jon Baken (of George & Jonathan)
Guest performance by Jesper Mortensen (aka ""Junior"" of Junior Senior) on the Playthings theme song, ""C'mon Everybody! (Playthings Rap)""

“The things I’ve lost, I myself must take them back.” With these words, the Viking Queen Mary awoke from her worst nightmares, fires of vengeance rising in her eyes. “It is a ghostly power of unpredictable mystery.” The flaming sails behind her back bewildered the queen: who were those enemies that ransacked the ships, slaughtered the soldiers, and plundered the treasures? It was the most mysteriously uncrackable case in the pirate history of the 19th century. Since then, the legendary Viking Queen Mary began to travel around the world searching all the ancient ruins to take back what originally belonged to her. Immortal Raiders, a dynamite video game that fantastically combines adventures, puzzle cracking and gun shooting, now lands upon the HTC Vive with the UE4 engine, a realistic landscape system, enemies swarming from unexpected directions, classic gun fires and exhilarating shooting experience.

Tennis Tune-Up: Target Practice - The first step in the continuing development of a real world simulation of tennis action.  Tennis Tune-Up incorporates real world physics so that ball action and reaction is as good as it gets.  Your voice commands take you to the action. In Tennis Tune-Up you ""say what you see"" to take control of the action.  The Command Board in each scene gives you the voice commands to use.  

The action starts in the Club House where you can view the video tutorial and then continue off to the stadium to practice.  

In the stadium you can have coach drop balls for you to hit at the targets or you can have the balls hit from across the court for rally practice.  Move the targets in, earn points and develop your game. With ""Practice Serve"" you develop your ball placement in the forehand or backhand courts.  Pick  up points by bringing in targets and firing away! 
 
There are many improvements and features in the future of Tennis Tune-Up:
First up, and coming soon,  is the addition of a two handed serve with one controller holding the racket and the other used to toss the ball.  When you choose this option in the Club House you will test your play area to make sure you have enough head room.  If you pass the test you'll go off to the Stadium for two handed serves.

Tennis Tune-Up will support the Vive Tracker Racket that HTC has available.  You'll  have the same Club House height check when you choose this option. 

We will have the plans for you to construct your own custom racket on our web site.  You will have the option of purchasing a custom racket for less than the cost of a Vive Tracker.

Take your action to the park in our City Park scene.

You'll be able to move around the court to practice your shots from various places on the court in the Court Practice scene.

You will take on players of different levels of skill in the Match Play Arena scene.

Unknightly (Early Access)

Unknightly is currently in its Early Access stage.
We thank you sincerely you for supporting us at this stage and being willing to take part in the vibrant community 
that helps shape Unknightly and build it into one of the finest stealth games VR has ever seen.

Short Background Story:

Unknightly is a medieval VR stealth game designed from the ground up for virtual reality.You play the role of a former member of the ""Knight's Order."" 
You have been betrayed and thrown into prison by someone very close to you... But who? 
Hungry for revenge and fortune you seek to uncover the identity of those who double-crossed you, 
gain insight into their motives, and eventually set the record straight.

Stealth First
This is first and foremost a stealth game, so there's almost always multiple ways to solve every challenge. Using combat to eliminate guards is viable but not mandatory, and might not always be possible!
Instead, you are encouraged to think through different situations and find ways to get around unnoticed, 
steal valuable items, and get out without being caught!

Stealth and Cunning?
Move around you will have to sneak past guards and climb walls.
Walk around in shadows and avoid areas with a lot of light to stay invisible even when walking close to guards.
Be careful not to make loud noises to avoid making guards suspicious.
Throw objects around to distract guards and create a window of opportunity for you to execute your plans!
And more...

The Experience & Choice
Choice in how you approach each and every level. There is always more than one path to the objective.
Scout through technically challenging and visually compelling environments in search of valuable objects.
Feel the tension creep up on you as you realize that every mistake could be fatal.
(also playable on Oculus Rift)

Get ready, the world won’t save itself.

Zombie Grenades Practice VR is an unusual mix of action and puzzle. Imagine that there are many zombies around you, but this time, you do not have a usual shotgun, a katana or at least a chainsaw. However, you have different grenades: frag, contact, bouncing (our favorite), radio, UV grenades, and others. 

The fewer grenades you use for completing the level, the more points you score. 

A rational choice of grenades and a precise throw are the key to solving tactical tasks on fifteen levels of the most beautiful post-apocalyptic fray you’ve ever seen. 


Key Features
* Single-player adventure mode
* High-quality graphics
* A high level of immersion
* Stats and achievements are available
* Game is easy to play but hard to master
* Requires different tactics to complete each level
* Great variety of locations, each location has own features and goals
* Wide choice of grenade types with different mechanics
* A realistic handling of weapons: with the help of motion controllers in virtual reality, use different types of grenades, performing realistic movements

Annie Amber – A life captured as a VR Puzzle Game


WHEN VIRTUAL REALITY LETS YOU FEEL A (VIRTUAL) REAL LIFE
Annie Amber is a VR puzzle game that leads you on an intense and dreamy journey through the life of a person condensed in a surreal and poetic experience. With innovative controls, AA makes you explore this strange and beautiful scenery that is life itself while using your wit to make your way through different memories. 

LIFE IS POETRY, SO IS ANNIE AMBER
But the life of Annie Amber isn’t told you in a plain way. Memories are symbolic, fragmented and complex, so the journey will be full of subtle beauty and poetry. Through sad and powerful piano tracks, youwill solve puzzles that will slowly unlock Annie Amber’s memories. The result is a game as minimalistic as intense: overwhelmed by huge celestial bodies, we will get to know and understand Annie Amber (fictional character) as if she were a close friend of us. 


USE YOUR MOTION CONTROLLERS!
Annie Amber is meant to be player with motion controllers. Use them to travel and interact with the environment and the puzzle elements. On the other hand, if you don't have motion controllers you can still play the game activating the mode without motion controllers. This innovative system matches the minimalistic and subtle approach of the whole game, while enhancing the immersion of the player. With no external controllers at all (aside from your hands or your head), the player will be a silent explorer while also being able of experiencing VR at its fullest. 


WELCOME TO VIRTUAL REALITY
The universality of its narrative and the accessibility of its innovative controlling system make Annie Amber not only a product for all kinds of audience, but also an excellent introduction to virtual reality and videogames. A whole new world of possibilities is about to emerge from this technology, and Annie Amber is a beautiful and intuitive way of embracing it for the first time while also being good enough for VR pros.

Fancy Skiing is developed by HashVR Studio built with the Unity Engine.The game's structure is based on real skiing that players use the handles just as ski poles to get power and lean left or right to control the direction, which brings players a strong immersion. Furthermore, we add a lot of fancy elements, like leaping grand canyons and hunting deer. While 
skiing, players try their best to avoid obstacles including dynamic ones to ski as far as they can and speed also plays an import role in your final score.
You can sit down to play the game if you feel a bit sick.

The Story
Insane Decay of Mind is a first person horror game. You play the role of Katherine, a young girl lost in the eerie hallways of a building she believes to be her school. As she begins to realise that this labyrinth that she has found herself in, is slowly warping her mind; She must make her escape in order to regain her freedom. 
But freedom comes at tremendous cost. 
Leaving the labyrinth is not as easy as it seems as you are not alone, there are entities that wish to keep you from escaping. 
During your dreadful experience, you will meet beings called ""Shadows"", manifestations of your worst nightmares; you will have to subdue them as you continue wandering the darkness that envelopes you and, perhaps, you will achieve your freedom.
But Why is the Game Named This?
Insanity is undoubtedly the main element: represented by the Shadow, it will encompass the entire story, haunt every frame, perhaps even disturb you own mind. It is from insanity, from foolishness, that the decay of mind begins. 
The only way to oppose this deterioration is to piece together the fragments of Katherine's story; they are hidden in the vast maze in which you find yourself, look for them very carefully.

“Watching humans in their decaying bodies is excruciating.” (*)

Report for duty to defend mankind against the machines! The Quickshot program will prepare you for battle and the somewhat ill-tempered training AI Dash will make sure you don’t cut corners on the way. This training simulation has you take out waves of projectiles in quick succession. Open fire with pistol, shotgun, submachine gun, laser and minigun or wield a weapon from more civilized days.

“Have you ever considered that everything around you might just be a simulation?” (*)

Some target projectiles disappear after one hit, some are more heavily armoured, some will even shoot back at you and some are not to be harmed at all. Learn the projectiles’ patterns or master the increasingly harder and faster challenges with nothing but your reflexes and experience the Quickshot slow motion effect as you pulverize the waves of targets coming at you. Apart from a quick trigger finger, you should be light on your feet. Dash will launch barriers at you that you’ll have to dodge and when taking fire, your only chance is to dive for cover or get your shield up. And who knows: Maybe there will even be some cake in the end (**).

(*) DASH, AI of Quickshot program
(**) ...there will be no cake, Sorry

Mission Details:

The players have spoken! We’ve heard your feedback, and updated Sniper Rust VR with some of the most popular requests. 
Get back in the action with:

•  Cutting-Edge Weaponry - Stalk your prey with a plethora of lethal firearms, locked and loaded with special functions suited for specific occasions. Available weapons include real-world guns like the DSR-50 and SVD sniper rifle, as well as the MaC-7, which was inspired by the CheyTac M200, and the Scout Rifle-inspired DG-5000.

• Death-Dealing Enemy Troops and Vehicular Combatants - Diverse enemy classes make every playable mission a challenge: be wary of well-concealed snipers, air/group assaults and traps behind enemy lines.

Flying Aces is a story based virtual reality experience unlike any other. You will experience what it’s like to train to become a navy pilot. As gamers, we search for experiences that aren’t possible in our daily lives. 

With Navy Pilot Simulator, we’re able to bring the armchair pilot into the cockpit of a fighter jet. Virtual Reality allows us to offer an experience that previous generations of hardware aren’t capable of. 

Conquering the game will require a skillset of hand eye coordination, decision making, and a tough stomach. You start out as a low ranked Ensign (below a junior lieutenant) tasked with learning the functionality of the F-18 Super Hornet. As you progress through the ranks, the missions become more challenging.

Features:
- Campaign with choice based missions
- Combat Theater Mode
- Aircraft Carrier Landing Mode
- Free Flight Mode

We wanted to know what it was like to propel yourself in space in virtual reality. Would you get dizzy, or would it blow your mind?

Let us know what you think.

Our backers have challenged us - if we can make it to 30,000 downloads we'll be in the running for 3 more years of development.

Designed from the ground up for the HTC Vive, Killer Klownz is an exhilarating VR Wave Shooter. Spawning from behind over-sized children’s toys and circus props, clowns from your worst childhood nightmares are coming to get you. Driven by an unimaginable rage, they want nothing more than to claw out your eyes and tear the flesh from your bones. A dark sky and thick fog obscure your view -- only as they close in can their terrifying faces can be seen. Armed with automatic weapons and an endless supply of ammunition, how long you survive is determined only by your accuracy and willingness to kill.

Killer Klownz features full roomscale support and dynamically adjusts its map to fit to your play space. Various types of enemies with varying degrees of speed and strength keep the game action challenging and unpredictable. 

Do you have what it takes to survive wave after wave of Killer Klownz?

Frontier takes you deep into the wild west in stunning virtual reality.

Discover a world bursting with life, from adorable bunnies hopping through the wilderness, to grizzly bears stalking you in the snow. Explore deserts brimming with colour, snowy woodlands with towering pines, and see the dawn of modern civilization in the bison inhabited great plains.

You can hunt a wide range of critters, but the wilderness also holds larger animals like deer, bison and grizzly bears!
The sky is also dense with hawks, snowy owls and bursts of tiny birds.

Every animal on the frontier has fully interactable (and sometimes even pickup-able) rag dolls, which thanks to the amazing quality of the HTC Vive, feel incredibly real. We recommend trying out the night time lighting, as the warm glow of your camp sites lamp mixed with truly dark nights leads to some of the most immersive virtual reality we have experienced to date!

Progress through the game, discovering new areas and guns as you hunt and explore, or experience the completed scenes immediately. It's your choice how you experience the world of Frontier. 
Pulling off impressive aim and speed will reward you with a range of guns inspired by those of the wild west.
Looking for a simple set of classic revolvers? maybe some sawn-off shotguns? or even a sniper rifle?
Well you can shoot cute little bunnies with all of them!


Frontier is room-scale, and is based around locomotion-free interactive scenes.

Shooting wooden signs will take you between scenes, and you can always go to an interactive menu by shooting any ""Red Rocks"" sign post.
Some notable things you will find on the menu are:

Input: you can choose between a very simple 1-button input (recommended for people new to VR) or a 2-button input, which makes use of the grip buttons.

Random: pop into a random scenario, with some special animal encounters.

Reset and Continue: when you first launch the game, you will be able to play through the games progression. If you go back to the main menu and continue, you can resume progression. If you instead shoot a destination sign, you can play that scene with all the guns unlocked! 

Cheats: if you really want to, you can shoot the bucket on the menu and enable some debug cheats. when using debug, press your Vive's menu button to teleport yourself around (helpful for setting a custom seated position).


Regardless of whether you are brand new to virtual reality, or a real enthusiast, there's is a lot of fun to be had in the wild west.
You can even pop your grandmother straight in, as Frontier uses incredibly simple one button input (or include the grip buttons, if you prefer) and contains absolutely no locomotion that could cause discomfort.

No matter what you are looking for in a VR game, Frontier will give you something to love!

A new level of escape game

Have you ever played an escape game? That amazing scenario, complex puzzles, where you must pay attention to everything, everywhere, find crazy items in bizarre places, and finally, open that door to victory.
What about real-life escape games? Some physical place, where you spend one entire hour inside, looking for clues and yelling at your friends for no reason, until those final seconds, where it all ends and you escape! Or someone comes in and says you’ve failed miserably.
Now, imagine an escape game in VR, where you can combine the best of all worlds. You can be 100% immersed in a completely interactable environment, without the boundaries of real world. A fully functioning complex, with countless rooms, and everything fits inside any space you might have in your room.
This is the concept of A Lost Room, an escape game without the boundaries of real world. The scale can be huge, anything can happen inside any room, and you’re there, in the middle of it all, on a full-scale VR experience.

A strange place, where danger could be anywhere

You enter a strange room, where everything is normal. This is just a controlled test. Everything is fine. A scientist talks to you, reassures you that everything is just planned, and nothing will go wrong.
But when you escape, and congratulations are in order, something strange happens. That door you’re supposed to get to meet your testers isn’t working. What is wrong with this place?
And what about those strange sounds? What is happening in there?
Now, your mission is to travel through this huge complex, find out what is happening, and escape.
But watch out, something might be lurking behind you...Will it find you first?
Beautiful places going wrong, rooms where there seemed to be a battle shortly before, e lots of blood. Will you escape in time? And in one piece?

A Lost Room is a full VR game, and requires a VR headset (HTC Vive or Oculus Rift) to be played. A VR capable PC is also required.

This game is a VR First-person shooting game developed for the HTC VIVE helmet. The game describes that a future Mech Warrior (first person, conqueror), in order to recapture the territories occupied by extraterrestrial invaders,uses his guns to battle with alien robots and eventually conquer aliens.

In this game, the first-perspective conqueror needs to continuously look for opportunities to pick up energy packages to supplement his health points to sustain his life in a fierce gun battle and earn score by destroying the robots; The shooting of the first perspective conqueror's weapon is controlled by the trigger on the HTC VIVE handle. The movement is controlled by the touchpad on the handle. The game is divided into ""moving mode"", ""fixed point mode"" and ""Light Saber Mode"" 3 parts. In ""moving mode"", players use touchpad to control the conqueror move around. In ""fixed point mode"", players use touchpad to control the conqueror to rise and down. In ""light Saber Mode "", the conqueror needs to wave the light saber to resist the robotic-launched missiles to protect the supply base and get score.

The entire game is very easy to play. The intense shooting and strong three-dimensional sense make users get a good game experience.

“The things I’ve lost, I myself must take them back.” With these words, the Viking Queen Mary awoke from her worst nightmares, fires of vengeance rising in her eyes. “It is a ghostly power of unpredictable mystery.” The ruined sails behind her back bewildered the queen: who were those enemies that ransacked the ships, slaughtered the soldiers, and plundered the treasures? Where am I? It was the most mysteriously uncrackable case in the pirate history of the 19th century. Since then, the legendary Viking Queen Mary began to travel around the world searching all the ancient ruins to take back what originally belonged to her.

You will be Shooting, dodging and catching everything from bullets, arrows and even meteors to use as weapons against the baddies. All missions are re-playable and vary from casual to extreme as you take on lots of enemies at once. The mission type varies between shootouts and assassination missions with branching paths. You have powers such as super speed, teleport and the ability to use almost everything in reach as a weapon, including bullets! That's right, when the baddies are shooting at you don't forget to grab or deflect their bullets, arrows and meteors.

Multiplayer VR flying FPS game - EARLY ACCESS
BattleSky VR is a Multiplayer VR shooter game at its core, bringing Overwatch style gameplay to the VR platform. Each player picks a Hero with vastly different size, powers and gameplay style to engage in fast-paced aerial combats against other players. Play online against other players with classic Team Deathmatch, Team Escort, Free For All, Attack and Defend, and other team based modes of up to 4v4 players! Pick your Heroes wisely, your unique powers will determine gameplay strategies as you team up to defeat the opponents!

Single Player Mission Mode
Each Hero has a single player mission mode where you'll learn the back story about the Heroes, and get familiar with the controls and the unique Flying Locomotion.

Co-Op Mode
We will be building some unique Co-op experience to complete a mission with your friends against AI!

Unique VR Locomotion
The game’s unique hyper-speed flying locomotion mechanisms had been tested by over 500 testers, and has been fine-tuned to allow nausea-free extreme high speed flying (imagine flying at 250 km/h). Less than 5% of the testers had experienced motion sickness.  With 4 (or more) heroes planned for the game by the time we exit Early Access, players will be sure to find a hero that matches their play style.

Which Hero do you want to be?
At beginning of early Access, two Heroes will be accessible: Draco, and Jet-9. The third Hero is Lady V, and it is being developed. Will you flap your wings to soar through the sky as Draco? Or, zoom through the sky with the hand thrusters as Jet-9? As we develop the game further during Early Access, we look forward to YOUR feedback and suggestions as we add more Heroes.

Our Ultimate Goal
Our goal is to create a Multiplayer VR FPS game that will define a new generation of e-Sport. We hope to co-create with YOU a game that has depth, encourages strategic gameplay, and is just awesome and unlike any other experiences on VR. Please see the ""Early Access"" section for what content we plan to complete by the time we exit Early Access.VRThis game requires a VR system. The game will initially only support HTC Vive when we start Early Access. The game works with Oculus but may be trick for those without the 3-sensor 360 setup for oculus.

Why Early Access?
We are still developing this game.  We are working with an unique VR experience, with many Heroes to choose from, each with a different type of VR locomotion and gameplay style. We are also working with flying and aerial combat, which is very rare in a FPS multiplayer game. These poses some challenges but also a lot of potential for an awesome new gaming experience.  A lot of this is quite experimental, so we want to engage the gaming community during Early Access to get your feedback, to create more Heroes, locomotion mechanisms, Maps, and Gameplay Modes as we develop the game continuously. We look forward to your feedback and help us shape this unique VR game.  We also hope to raise some money from Early Access so we can expand our team to speed up the development process.

Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?
around 6-12 months.

How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?
Our goal is to create a Multiplayer VR flying FPS game that will define a new generation of e-Sport. We hope to co-create a VR game with YOU that has depth, encourages strategic gameplay, and is just awesome and unlike any other experiences in VR currently. 

We plan to achieve the following by the time we launch the game officially:
-4 Heroes to choose from (or more, if we can get interesting suggestion from the community)
-4 Missions (each featuring a Hero's back story)
-6 maps or more for Multiplayer PvP (up to 8 players)
-More Multiplayer game modes that we will develop together with the community
-Available for Vive, Oculus, and Windows MR.
-We might explore cross-platform gameplay with non-VR players.

”What is the current state of the Early Access version?
-3 completely playable Heroes: Draco,Jet-9, and Lady V.
-1 Single Player Mission.
-Single Player timed race mode (for the 2 maps).
-Co-Op Escort mode (escort the airship and defend against AI).
-3 maps for Multiplayer PvP (up to 8 players)

Set off on an amazing journey through Unknown Fate, a strongly story-driven first-person adventure with many puzzles to solve and enemies to beat. Become Richard, who suddenly passes seamlessly from the real world into a surreal universe. You’ll encounter strange characters, unfamiliar artifacts and scenes resembling Richard’s former life, of which he has lost all memory. Yet, he knows that this is not where he is supposed to be. The world he has come to inhabit is strange and distant. He feels the urge to find out more about this surreal universe and the creatures inhabiting it, in order to find a way out – out and back to his real self, his real life that he knows he has yet to fully recall.

Engulfed in mystery, you take cautious steps deep into the unknown, only to have your mind swept away by yet more questions, nibbling at your grasp of what you think is real and true – your certainties will start to crumble.

With no way back and a strong urge for answers beating in your temples, you push on, striving to get a grip on the odd difficulties surrounding you, eagerly awaiting the moment your mind will become untangled when the thread of your journey finally unravels all the way. But there is some way yet to go…

“Soon you will have all the answers to your questions. But you still have so much to see…”

VR Disc Golf is the first disc golf game for the Vive to have real disc physics! Complete physics simulations underlay all disc interactions, creating fun and unique game-play. Your disc realistically soars and bounces past each challenge. You can throw backhand, forehand (side arm), overhand (hammer throw) and just about everything else.

Sports Camera

Ever wanted to follow behind your disc after a particularly epic drive? Now you can! VR Disc Golf uses a cutting edge sports camera system to put you right in the action. Revolutionary camera controls leverage your body's natural tendency to move. You'll love seeing every bounce and wobble of your disc as you soar over the course, just like you've always wished you could! You can even switch your disc mid-flight for advanced game-play to influence the outcome like you've always wanted!

Single Player

VR Disc Golf launches with one outrun themed 18-hole course. Intense game-play awaits as you explore each hand crafted hole's particular challenge. Your throwing arm will be put to the maximum test by black holes, lakes of burning lava, spinning obstacles, and other denizens of the deep Internet. True disc physics provides limitless replay value.

Party Mode - Local Multiplayer

What could be better than playing VR Disc Golf by yourself? Playing with friends and family of course! Party Mode (only one virtual reality headset required) allows you to play competitive rounds of disc golf with up to four local players. The game accommodates HMD sharing by keeping track of whose turn it is, and reminding you to switch players when the time is right.

Music

With over 40 music tracks you'll never hear a boring sound! Music created by Deceased Superior Technician. Thanks for the awesome music!

WARNING: VR Disc Golf uses a sports camera that rotates your view around the disc based on the direction you are facing. Take your time getting used to the sports camera and it will provide a naturally immersive locomotion experience. If you feel any motion sickness you can turn off the sports camera from in-game options.

A little girl’s nightmares and fears represented on this VR title will take you to a mysterious room trying to break the scoreboards and playing with other friends locally… using just one VR headset! Attention: This video game is modding friendly. Create your own hordes, attack strategies and even enemies!

In this experience the player takes the place of Griff, a Guardian Teddy Bear who has to fight possessed dolls that attack Sophie, a little girl that just moved with her mom to a mysterious house. Sophie’s Guardian is a VR Survival Horror FPS that provides a creepy experience for players with three intense game modes: Guardian, Gunslinger and the unique mode; The Puppeteer. If you enjoy arcade games then press the trigger quickly to become a better nightmare hunter!

Playing is very simple; the player can choose one of the three different game modes. Then a 10 seconds countdown announces the beginning of the game. You must defeat the dolls before they can hurt you and if you receive big amounts of damage you lose the game. 

The Puppeteer mode:
The players take turns to manipulate the doll’s spawn points with the use of a game pad. That affects directly on how the dolls attack the player that is using the headset. In other words, one player protects Sophie of being attacked and the other player triggers the evil dolls’ waves.

The Gunslinger mode:
Tests your accuracy, reflexes and dexterity with the increasing hordes of evil dolls. The player must survive the longest while more and more dolls keep coming.  This game mode features global and local scoreboards.

The Guardian mode:
Here’s where Sophie and Griff’s story can be experienced. The player faces 15 evil dolls' waves and the victory is achieved by defeating all the enemies including the final boss.

No more parties at the Tech Noir and no DeLorean to take you back in time and save the world. The machines have taken over and you have to fight your way through the deadly streets of Delta City to reach the last rescue shuttle. Will you make it or will you be lost in time, like tears in the rain?

""I’ve seen things, you people wouldn’t believe!""

Get ready for an action-packed breakneck ride through a futuristic apocalypse! You will run, swing and glide through a dystopia taken right out of your favorite 80s sci-fi action movies. But moving along conveyor belts, sliding down ramps and swinging over urban chasms on ropes will only get you so far. If you want to catch that last ride off the planet, you’ll have to master wall-running, use jump-pads and rise above the city holding on to flying drones. But your run has not gone unnoticed: Machines will try and stop you, so you’ll have to shoot your way out of your encounters with the vicious Hunter Killers, flying assassination-robots that don’t feel pity, or remorse, or fear.

""It’s VPL time!""

Join the VIRTUAL PARKOUR LEAGUE, the thrilling future sport in the World of Tower 2. Show your friends who’s boss in 8 challenging courses in 4 different worlds. Master combinations of exciting obstacles and movement patterns and shoot your way through walls and windows before they stop you in your dash for the finishing line. The only help comes from time boni, which can be grabbed while hurtling through the levels by players with the perfect rhythm in their movement.

So slip on your PC Virtual Reality Headset and dive into a neon lighted homage to countless 1980s sci-fi and cyberpunk spectacles. A successful run through the story mission will keep you on your feet for approximately 60 minutes, a run in one of the VPL levels is a 3 to 6 minute sprint. Hidden in the world of The Tower 2 are VHS tapes that unlock precious collectibles right from the future for the holographic trophy cabinet. Get ready for your mission and the VPL with a tutorial and get pumped by the Tower II 80s-style soundtrack.

Guardians of the digital realms, called TRAKKERS, navigate the maze-like node structures, defending against the insidious, viral intruders out to consume all life.

Immerse yourself in this cyber landscape (with synthwave music supplied by Milwaukee artist Dashcam), defeating enemies and collecting files before escaping through the exit.

Is your goal simply to escape, collect files to slow down the attack or become the ultimate hero and save the system completely? That, dear TRAKKER, is up to you to decide.

8 levels, including three difficulty settings, provide an experience suitable for every player's skill level - ranging from engagement to adrenaline-fueled panic.

Beat Blaster is a VR game about Shooting & running where everything happens to the beat of the music. An original mix of styles with each level offering a new challenge.

30 SONGS & AMBISONIC AUDIO
Each level introduces a novelty and all the games are different thanks to the intelligent generation of levels. 
Ambisonic sound lets you experience the music in an entirely new way.

NO WAITING TIMES
There are no loading screens, complicated menus or eternal waiting. Beat Blaster is direct fun without complications.

4 WAYS OF MOVEMENT
You can choose between the classic VR controller, the new 3dRudder, tilting the head or the intuitive and original control based on the movement of the head. 

NO MOTION SICKNESS
Beat Blaster is a VR game with a high-speed component. But all moves in the game are designed without rotating the player, thus minimizing the probability of motion sickness.

EASY RULES
To clear a level, you must reach the end of the song without dying. 
Sounds easy, doesn't it? You have a Blaster with infinite ammunition and a single life to dodge or kill all the enemies that will appear to the rhythm of the music.

The Cave is a 2 in 1 VR bundle. An arcade game and a real world fear experience.

At start scene you can choose:
1. The Arcade game and have lots of fun in a 'quest for diamonds' action game trying to collect as many diamonds as fast as you can on a dangerous plank while avoiding oscillating hanging wood logs. You have to try!

Few games are designed so close to real VR power! (review by the real vr gamers @ Mallorca)

2.The second option is an experience  designed to make you feel sensations nearly impossible in real life without physical danger.
It's not about puzzle or quiz games to achieve goals, it's about feeling. Feel, watch, hear and enjoy almost real sensations.

We believe VR is a new language and as such we designed a realistic cave environment with a deep pit that you can try to cross on a narrow inestable wood plank. A great experience for you and your friends. Live it alone or watch your friends in a dangerous situation. How will they react? Horror? Laugh? Fun? You will also have in your hands a valuable spotlight to help you in the darkness of the deep pit.

Come on! Do you dare? People will talk about it!

The Story
Danbai, the heavenly dreamland of warm wind, sea, sand and the sun. The capital of theft, robbery and murder. Everything was under our control. We were brutal and elusive.

But nothing lasts forever. After the last of our endeavours the governors lost their patience. The police has found the way to push us and brought up special forces to deal with us. Most of our people got arrested. I was able to escape with my partner and the money from our last robbery using a lorry.

When we were leaving the city the police caught up and stopped us. I was able to get on my bike and drive away while my partner was persuading them. Let the pursuit begin!

How long will you survive against an unrelenting horde of fluffy-wuffy alien bunnies? 

Join up with the Critter Death Squad as the team's chief exterminator (who may or may not be a clone) and arm yourself to the teeth with epic weaponry designed by the team’s unhinged mad scientist, get tactical updates from a KGB pizza delivery driver, and fight to keep Earth off the dinner menu!

GAME FEATURES:
 - Hundreds of onscreen bunnies attacking at once!
 - Fight against fantastic toon style alien bunnies--the Fluffies, Heavies, and Scouts
 - Three unique weapons that unlock the longer you survive
 - Overclockable weapon damage output with consecutive kills
 - Powerful secondary weapons provide strategic advantages
 - Local and Global highscore boards for boisterous bunny bounty bragging!
 - Intelligent difficulty engine that will adjust to your skill level in realtime as you play
 - Three difficulty modes (Fluffy Wuffy, Hangry, Really Hangry!) for an extra challenge
 - Score multiplier gives you greater bonuses for playing on a harder difficulty
 - Make your stand in a vibrant section of New Los Angeles, all in immersive, roomscale VR!
 - Featuring an epic original score by Dave Dexter that changes dynamically as you play

Important performance note! Hangry Bunnies From Mars utilizes a physics-based character system, which makes for a lot of fun gameplay, but does increase the base system requirements. We recommend running this game on a PC with at least a Core i5 processor and a GTX 1060 or else the game may be affected by slowdowns which limit the fun of the game.

9a8d64f0-52a9-4d88-ac86-ca7437c5dc70,BearHammer,"¥1,320","Description

BearHammer will make you feel strong, like BEAR. In BearHammer you can absolutely smash enemies with giant hammers, sending them flying throughout Bearonia with powerful ragdoll physics. You can also THROW these hammers and return them, simply by holding the trigger.

BearHammer is an action RPG arcade game, a unique mix between a wave based arcade game and a story-based RPG.

For fans of quick action & difficult challenges, there are 20 waves featuring different varieties of monsters and different objectives, ranging from taking down powerful bosses, surviving onslaughts of enemies with unique attacks, to defending the village of Bearonia itself. We hope this arcade style gameplay appeals to people looking for quick satisfying and especially challenging gameplay, making it a fun game to show off to friends.  Combat in the game is also family friendly, as the game features no blood or gore, but still gives a satisfying feeling of impact when hitting monsters.  

For fans of story, immersion, and exploration, BearHammer features the beautiful island of Bearonia to explore with a variety of new weapons to unlock and special challenges hidden around the island. You'll get the opportunity to ride a bear, fly on a dragon, use a mushroom drum set, and discover some of the hidden story elements behind the Toad King's invasion.

You are tasked with defending Bearonia and its inhabitants of bears, turtles, and rabbits from the invasion of the evil armies of the Toad King, who summons evil StabRats, Crabbos, Dragon Beasts, Battle Toads, and more to spread his Power of the Frossst.

This isn't another wave based game where you don't move and everything just comes at you--to win at BearHammer you must plan your attack and move throughout the level to stop different boss monsters and close portals from spawning more enemies.

The game features teleport controls and free motion controls, which have given very few players dizziness due to the game's level design that features mostly flat ground and far views of the horizon.

In the coming months, we plan to add online multiplayer to the game, to support both co-op modes and a 4-player domination mode where you'll have the ability to summon monsters to attack your opponents in addition to swinging the game's namesake BearHammers. Further out on our road map, we'll also be adding additional maps and single player challenges.

GAME STORY:
You are a deadly assassin, captured and locked away on a floating prison in deep outer space.  Aliens have taken over the prison and have begun testing on the inmates and turning their bodies into alien weaponry to prepare for the war on humanity.

As part of the testing the assassins are thrown into the pit as the aliens watch inmates battle each other to the death.  Players must use their boxing skills to fight their way to the tops of the ranks to win their freedom. 

Your only chance for survival and to prevent the war is to battle through the alien horde, defeat their leader and overtake the prison.

ViSP – Virtual Space Port is a creative building game for VR. Construct your own space port out of blocks and defend it against relentless enemies to fortify your space colony!

GAMEPLAY
The core feature of ViSP is the unrestricted building mechanic. By dragging blocks out of one another, you can freely create complex, intertwined structures filling the whole room!
Your goal is to connect your space port to all the monuments floating around you in space, to gather their energy and find other cores scattered in the galaxy.
In order to do that, you need to manage your resources, form patterns out of blocks to create special modules and build defensive structures to protect your station against enemies.

FEATURES
ViSP is a fresh approach for a VR building game, with all game mechanics tailored towards a unique roomscale VR experience. The game is simple and intuitive at its core, but gets increasingly complex the further the player advances and offers a large creative freedom.
Lose yourself in the calm and fascinating atmosphere and let your creativity flow while constructing an aesthetic and complex spaceport spanning the whole room!
On the other hand, you need to react quickly and build up your station strategically to defend it against incoming threats, while always keeping an eye on your resource counter!

TEAM
ViSP is developed by Visper Games, a team of two Game Design students from Berlin. It started off about two years ago, as a small game jam project at university. The development was an exciting ride for us since and now we‘re glad to finally release our first commercial game!
We‘re happy to receive any kind of feedback, so feel free to contact us! We’ll do our best to respond to your messages quickly and to fix any problems that may occur. :)

a6a74cde-073b-463f-b98e-99c6e6d9bc6e,Racket: Nx Demo,Free,"Description

Racket: Nx is an arcade sports game based on Squash and positional audio, and draws inspiration from arcade classics such as Arkanoid and Breakout.
A game of skill, Racket: Nx focuses on spatial awareness, motor control and reflexes. Also on outer space.

•	Spatial Awareness - this is the first game to feature Waves Nx 3D audio technology. In Racket: Nx, you're not going to be staring in any one direction for long. Targets can appear anywhere around you and the ball is rarely still. Good orientation is key. With Waves Nx, sound plays a major role in directing your attention, giving you a constant sense of your environment and immersing you in virtual space.

•	Motor Control and Reflexes - Racket: Nx's physics are intuitive and finely tuned. It will take you no time to start playing. You'll quickly improve, discovering more control in your motion and swings. But no matter how long you play, you'll always be able to get better. There is always room for more nuance.

•	Outer Space - if you're reading this, you already know VR is cool. Racket: Nx makes a point of this by throwing you to different places around the universe surrounded by a psychedelic sci-fi light-show of colors and sounds to play with. Want?

The demo features the solo 'Infinite Training' mode: On the hexagonal bricks of your arena's walls, patterns of targets appear with sounds, lights and colors. Hitting the right targets with the ball buys you more time and score. But the targets aren't always friendly, nor idle. They change in random waves as you play, increasing in difficulty and speed. Eventually, the timer will reach zero and explode, but you can always push the bar a tiny bit higher!

Later in 2016 Racket: Nx will be released on early access, as we start introducing major features such the VR level editor, sharing and rating systems for user generated levels, and multiplayer.
Things will get really crazy, really fast, so stay tuned and start practicing!

Please enjoy responsibly!
(No, really. Be careful not to hit stuff when you play.)

7 lives is a fantastic tale. A near death experience on a subway platform in Tokyo takes you to a strange world. You access memories and fear of people around you.

The experience offers : 
-	a metaphysical and sensory journey through dimensions that remain usually invisible
-	a strong visual experience, mixing live action and real time

1b1063c6-3fd0-481a-8cb8-6d163da051de,Anno 1500,¥568,"Description

Have you ever dreamed of traveling back in time? Now you can, with your new friend Olaf S9.

Anno 1500 is a time travel adventure that takes you back to the late 1500s and the township of Luleå in the north of Sweden. On a barren place simply called The Mountain preparations for a church holiday are well under way. People here speak several different languages and dialects. You get to meet three characters who represent three branches of a multicultural society. Luleå parish, from mountain to coast, has about 3000 inhabitants. Gustav Vasa's son — John III — is the king of Sweden. The shift from Catholicism to Protestantism is still very recent. The people of this parish come to the church town to attend mass, trade and pay taxes.

No one lives here, except occasionally during these visits. The port has already moved further out into the bay due to the uplift but the city of Luleå is still founded here in 1621. Some citizens are forced to move here but the vast majority still live in neighboring villages. The shallow bay will soon make it impossible for ships to enter and Luleå is then moved to its current location. What remains here is known as Gammelstad — Church Town — a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1996.

This game features the Chinese vampire stories. Inspired by the Hong Kong movie in 1985,  Mr. Vampire series, we build up a game with the fantastic Chinese spells and scary scenes in order to invite players to enjoy the experience of the interesting horror movie.

 The background information that you might want to know:

Different from the western zombie, most of the Chinese vampire is the people that had been dead, and suffered from the undying hatred in the end of their life. Due to the reasons mentioned above, their body will never rot, and finally, they will turn to be rigid bodies and become vampires to eat people alive. 

Since they have rigid bodies, the Chinese vampires  are not afraid of ordinary weapons such as the gun shooting, or bomb...etc..  People can kill Chinese vampire only through spell and spelled sword.

The special thing you have got to know is  people's breath will attract vampire to attack. So, please keep in mind, when you don't have any spell or sword in your hand, don't breathe!!

Join us for the adventure of Qian Shan Village!

Halt!: VR Road Traffic Madness is a simulator of road traffic control officer.
At this alpha release, you deal with endless waves of cars and ambulances. You can wait for a while to create a traffic jam for harder challenge, you can put all your effort to crash cars for fun. Play as you like!

In the game, you encounter three types of car:

Normal cars, they obey your signal.
Ambulances, they won't stop because they're in a hurry!
Police cars, they will sound siren but they obey the signal :p

All you need to do: pointing a controller horizontally to allow traffic, vertically to halt.

FAQ
How to restart/quit?
Push grip button on Vive Controller, keep pointing the button you want to choose.

Roadmap
I'm planning to make several goal-oriented levels, gradually increasing difficulty such as low visibility, pedestrians, and additional vehicles like big trucks, motorcades, and trolley! Additionally I will polish UI and create easier level for tutorial. Please let me know if you have any ideas for improvement!

Cosmos Crash – The first person shooting & puzzle VR game of Viriver Studio is now online.

In this game, you’ll be a space pilot with your ship trapped by orbits in the depths of the vast universe. By firing high-tech marbles, you need to make matches of three or more same-colored marble in the orbit before it reaches your ship. This early access version contains 10 different orbits waiting for you, think fast and aim smart to solve these problems!
 
Spatial 3D orbit 
The 3D spatial orbits are the biggest highlight of Cosmos Crash. Surrounded by various shapes of orbits (crown, pipe, balance, gear, etc)， the game brings you immersive experience as if you are just there in the universe, giving full play to the superiority of virtual reality.

Strategy
Each of the 10 orbits has different strategies to clear all the marbles. Special orbit like accelerating orbit (speeding up the pass-by marbles) and balance shaped orbit (requires clarity of both side orbit) appears as the game progressed. 

Special marbles
If you're good enough to rack up 3 or more combos, you’ll get special marbles that'll help you on your way. The special effect of that marble depends on the color of the last match you made. You’ll have 6 types of special marbles to choose from.

Moreover
We also prepared some fancy extra contents in the gameplay. For example, if you clear particular orbit area, the lanterns around the area will be lit, making the whole universe interesting!

1ae00f8b-555d-4e66-b780-3f768b1d5d96,Takelings House Party,"¥2,050","Description

A frantic and whimsical party game for VR. Takelings have invaded this quiet suburban home and it's up to Hal to exterminate these pests using whatever means necessary!

Progress through the house where each room is a different game. Take turns in VR as Hal facing off against the Takelings controlled by up to 8 couch players using their smartphones and/or joysticks. 

This game is currently in Early Access.

We're a small team and this is our studio's first release. Although we are very excited to finally get to share our party game with the VR community, we'd like to be able to guarantee a stable experience by full release. We'd love to engage with our customers and create an experience that is as inclusive and as fun as possible. 

As a 9 player party game there are a lot of variations in possible experiences. Balancing our Party Mode's points system and the gameplay of each minigame will require a lot of play testing with many different home setups.

The full game will feature 5 minigames instead of the 3 offered now, and a more balanced ""Party Mode"" experience. We'd also like to add support for AI Takelings allowing you to bolster your Takelings count in your parties or even play solo.

Feedback from the community will be vital to our development. What works and doesn't work for your particular VR setup? Is there a key feature missing that would make this your ultimate VR party game? Are you enjoying cooking your friends in a toaster? We want to know!

Aeon is a VR shooting game for HTC Vive . Forget the story line, this Aeon is all about the action packed combat. You start the game with a pair of sharp swords on your back, as well as two heavy caliber pistols, and then it is up to you to kill the enemy! The fighting animation is brought to life with an incredible time warp shooting ability. It’s just like all those badass movies with slow motion fight scenes. In this virtual reality you can do the same thing. There is no cool down time for bullet regeneration, but the more you fire your weapons or move your hands the faster time will go. In general, the slower you move, the slower time flows. This allows the game to have a slow motion, movie like rhythm! So control your body, be steady, observe your enemy's actions carefully, and take the shot. 

A lot of our hard work and focus has gone into creating this virtual reality game for you to enjoy. We hope you have fun as you interact with the world and as you use the weapons we have provided you to kill the enemy. Here is the list of features:

- You can now see your whole body in the VR game and dance if you want to. Our technology will use your headset and controller position to calculate your other body movements. We think being able to see your body is very important.

- We put a lot effort into the reactions of enemies when they get hit. If you shoot a different part of the enemy from different distances, they will react very differently. We also made an extremely effective real-time cutting system, which allows you to use your swords to cut everything into pieces.

- We added fast teleport locomotion with your touchpad. You can now teleport to any direction by pressing your touchpad.

- We have put in a lot of detail to the physical reactions. The bullet shells will bounce around and you can catch them if you're fast enough. You can reverse an enemy's rocket or slash it into pieces. You can use your weapon to block or cut bullets. You can also hold the shell of a rocket in your arms.

We have already started to work new content, new levels, new badass weapons, and new interesting monsters. We are open to suggestions and any cool ideas for the game. Please send us your ideas and feedback in the forum!

d413bf3f-53b8-4995-a0b4-c2bd278f9e92,Towards a Perilous Journey,¥224,"Description

In charge of a squad of two ships, face the many enemies scattered throughout your adventure.

This adventure, let's talk about it. Sometimes by day, sometimes by night, you will progress through colorful environments, tinged with a predominantly electro musical atmosphere. The adventure is composed of 24 different chronicles, each conceived around a dedicated music. Accuracy, dodge and coordination will be the main ingredients of this perilous journey.

Energy Management:
This game was imagined around a core gameplay mechanic: the manipulation of Energy. Energy is easily gained by destroying your enemies, but it is just as easily lost when one of the ships is hit. Energy will allow you to merge your ships when the danger is too present. Energy is also required to activate your secondary attack and defense systems. Finally, Energy is intimately related to your final score, which enables you to build skills by improving the weapons of your ships. The only limitation to Energy recovery is yourself.

Game Modes:
Two game modes are available. If you prefer short gaming sessions, you may browse each of the 24 chronicles individually. On the contrary, if you want to start a long session and if you like the challenge, you should try the Journey mode which takes you through all of the chronicles. Be careful though, if one of your ships is destroyed, it will become inaccessible until the end of the Journey. Will you be able to escape unscathed?

Game Music Tracks:
The musical playlist of Towards a Perilous Journey is composed of 24 meticulously selected tracks, in agreement with their respective authors.

The Earth is dying, the space conquest experienced a great expansion thanks to two independent space and military companies, Sarkan Corp. and Zil Industries. Men exhausted the Earth of its resources while accelerating its destruction. The wealthy population was able to exile and colonize Proxima B, the nearest habitable planet.

Drilling operations have resulted in sustainable energies and a significant technological improvement. The Sarkans found Red Zircon and the Zils a site of Blue Laterite, a missing link for the manufacture of weapons.

 The two organizations do not agree on the sharing of resources, tensions are emerging and each having developed weapons, come into conflict, wanting to have control and technological monopoly over the city.

 During this conflict several mercenaries left the various companies, refusing to participate in the destruction of what they saw as a second chance. Faced with this danger, the Sarkans and the Zils allied again to dismantle this rebellion and protect the extraction of resources from the planet.

Ashes of the Ark
Virtual reality meets zombies in space! Ashes of the Ark is a first-person shooter built exclusively for VR that immerses you in an end of humanity scenario on the Ark - one of the last bastions of hope as humanity flees a zombie-apocalypse.

When you are awoken from your cryo-station - the realization sets in that you must save the rest of the sleepers. Alone and armed with the weapons and scarce ammo you find, you will need to solve puzzles and fight in order to navigate through the remnants of the Ark

Brush Up VR is a simple tooth brushing challenge game. It is derived from the Brush Up mixed reality mobile game. Developed with NIH support, Brush Up wins health gaming awards (like the 2015 Innovation in Games and Simulation award from America's prestigious Institute of Medicine) for teaching young children toothbrush mastery.  While the mixed reality game is a bathroom companion, the VR game is a fun exploration of dentition. Kids learn that brushing means a lot more than cleaning the front teeth plus a quick scrub down one side.  Designed for young people of any age -- the brushing challenge is lively fun for anyone.

Created by Vive Studios’ first-party developer Fantahorn Studio, Front Defense is a highly polished, arcade-style room-scale VR shooter set in the final days of World War II’s European theater. The invasion of Normandy is over. The fiercest firefights of the war have just begun. Front Defense immerses players in the role of an Allied Forces hero fighting the last relentless onslaught by the Axis in a fictional European town. Hunker down behind well-armed positions as you duck, dive, switch and reload weapons, throw grenades, and man-mounted guns to fight back the enemy assault. Use heavy weaponry against increasingly brutal enemy soldiers, arm the Bazooka or call in airstrikes against armored cars and heavy tanks, and man the thunderous 50-Cal to take down suicidal Stuka dive bombers. From the opening salvo, Front Defense uses the power of VR and the precision of Vive’s room-scale to deliver one of the most intense war shooter experiences ever created.

Key Features:
• Experience an intense WWII shooter as never before in a superbly polished game designed explicitly for Vive’s room-scale VR and precision tracking
• Defend strategic positions in a beautifully detailed European town slowly being destroyed by a brutal enemy
• Seamlessly switch between a variety of weapons, from light and heavy firearms to mounted machine guns
• Use Bazookas, grenades or call in airstrikes to take on an entire armored division, from well-armed infantry to armored cars, tanks and dive bombers
• Take on the mysterious Axis super weapon in an epic boss fight finale
• Increasingly challenging stages and global leaderboards deliver hours of game play and high replay value
(also playable on Oculus Rift)

Welcome to Copter and Sky, a brand new, hexacopter RC simulation! 

You will control a modern RC hexacopter in different gamemodes, levels and more! You will fight against the wind to fly, monitor the battery charge and avoid crashing into objects to prevent damage which could lead your copter to failure. Currently, the game has many features such as - going fishing, racing, golf, shooting cannon balls into the goal and carrying objects from A to B all while controlling your drone!

Child Of Ault is a tower-defense-shooting VR game, which will make you feel more real in game. In this game, your character is a boy who uses his magic catapult and tools to against wicked witches and defense your homeland.

Toy system:

If you want to succeed in battle, simply being the ""best shot"" is not enough, you also need a good strategy to manage your military forces.

Thankfully, you're alone. Use your set of magic toys to defend against monsters’ attacks. Each toy has its specific skill, opening up multiple strategies to take on the monster attackers.
Place your arsenal along the path, between the monsters and your base and watch, as they fight with you to eliminate your enemies. 

Weapon System:

Your catapult packs quite a punch, and can fire normal ammo or use up to three additional special skills, which burn , freeze, or electrocute the monster hordes. Take out as many monsters as you can to gain access to these special damage types.

Choose from multiple vantage points:

Move freely between towers, in order to get a better shot at the monsters and increase your chances of victory.

Playing instructions:

Hold your catapult with your left hand and fire your magic skills by pulling the spring backwards with your right hand. 
Additionally, headshots count. Aim for the heads to gain maximum damage.
Use your wand to manage your skill distribution. 

Go forth and protect your lands.

Close your eyes, put your VR headset on, and you’ll become a shipwrecked man, on a tropical island in the middle of Pacific Ocean.
First of all, you have to survive.
That’s because your hunger and thirst will make you suffer, like in real life.
So you have to understand how to satisfy your primal needs, interacting with animals or plants that you will find on the island.
Of course you will need to craft some tools, using rocks, wood, plants, and start a fire to cook or to have light during the night.
But, if surviving is your first objective, the second one is to escape the island. To achieve to runaway, you’ll have to build a raft and face the Ocean’s weaves.
Can you handle it?

ABOUT THE PROJECT

This will be the first release of the game, further updates are coming soon.
 
Our desire is to continue working on it, implementing the game with new interactable objects, food, drink, tools, animals and, most of all, we would love to add new islands and the way to move from one to the other.

So, in this first phase, we will really appreciate 
all your feedback and advices, of any kind, 
they will help us to develop a better game.

Sure you’re in our space-based research facility, but even in space you need a recreation room. So, in this unit, enter the rec room and dance with holograms, play a little billiards or just relax and watch some television. Oh, and you might just learn a few things along the way.

Wendy, the Science Teacher, gets to play with a Tesla Coil and you go along for the ride. If you don’t know what a Tesla Coil is, we can tell you that it is a shocking experience. 

The Physics Force Field is like no place you’ve ever traveled. It’s a playground where Coulomb’s Law and Newton’s first three laws come alive with giant circus balls, force fields, traction beams and the laws of gravity completely suspended. You will experience the laws of nature in a way that would never be possible in the real world. 

Football and concussions are a big topic of conversation and for our virtual field trip, we travel to Purdue University and discuss the latest science with American football helmets, the forces involved with the sport and actions being taken to better protect athletes using the laws of physics.

Finally, in our story, we learn about the physics in the game of pool as well as how Newton’s laws of motion are an integral part of this game. It’s a fascinating story of action and reaction.

You woke up in a strange place — is it a dream or reality? What do you need to do? Are you alone here?

A sneak peak into Nevrosa world that brings new gameplay mechanics to VR games:

Redirect walking — we don't use teleport or any other locomotion system. You'll have to do it on your own but don't go beyond your chaperone! You can get on youtube!
No jumpscares.
You just take things with your hands and only one button is used — press a trigger on your controller to interact.
Oh and you can die. And probably will.

Original puzzles, dark atmosphere and creepy creature and a creepy creature that follows you will help you to prepare for the upcoming full-time escape-horror experience that will finish the story you have started.

Some more things you'll probably find in Nevrosa: Prelude

Art deco-inspired environment filled with creepy puzzle machines is waiting to share it’s secrets. 
Survival horror elements: strange creatures hide in this room… What will happen when you meet?
An evil artifact in your hands: why does it follow you? Does it whisper something or is it just in your head? 
Dark soundtrack with position sound system.
Different endings: you decide how this nightmare ends.

For each caught egg the player is given one point. First, the eggs roll slowly, but the pace of the game is accelerating gradually. Every 20 and 30 scored points the pace of the game slows down a bit. 

In the case the egg falls, the player is given a penalty point, which is indicated by a chicken - it will appear on the box on your right. If it occurs in the presence of a kitten, which appears in the box on your left, then the player is given a half of the penalty point - on the box on your right appears an egg instead of the chicken. 

Every 20 and 30 of caught eggs the penalty points will be cancelled. After receiving three penalty points (from three to six eggs fell down), the game stops. 

The game has two difficulty levels and mode Time Attack. In the simple mode, the eggs start to roll only by three trays at the same time. In the hard mode on all four trays and the fourth tray is located behind you! 

In Time Attack mode eggs will roll by 3 trays for three minutes, every second quicker – you should lose as few eggs as possible. 

Test your dexterity! Catch as many eggs as you can!

& more to come…

VRUnicorns is a bunch of game jammers from Europe. We fancy making quirky semi-realistic room scale VR sports games with a touch of grotesque humor.

A bit of our #Archery story:
Jakob and Max have known each other since many years. Like since waaaaay......back. Julie and Max first met each other at Shayla Games in Spring 2015. Max and Julie organized a Vive Jam in Stockholm in Autumn 2015 and Max had invited Jakob, who mainly sat in a room for himself being grumpy. 

Julie organized a Vive Jam in Copenhagen in early 2016 and Max brought Jakob to Copenhagen. Jakob was still grumpy, but very productive and PizzaHood was the very first version of what we now call #Archery. 

Jakob and Max continued working on so-called Pizzahood and then became part of VRUnicorns early Summer 2016 (talks about it started in Amsterdam...go figure) and Julie joined the dev team as what we call #IdeaGuy (which means all talk - no talk...testing&giving feedback an such). She forced the name #Archery on the game. For reasons only she knows. Julie was finally allowed to join the dev team for real early 2017 (she was kicked out of version control many times before that) and Horatiu is also working on #Archery now in between #SelfieTennis & #Utopia.

Unseen Diplomacy casts you as an elite member of The British Espionage Tactical Initiative, defeating the plans of evil-doers around the world. With a real-life obstacle course created by the Vive’s incredible virtual reality environment, you will run and roll, sneak and solve your way through volcano lairs and moon bases. 

It behaves like ‘redirected walking’, which means the core control of the game is directed by the player's own movements. 
The experience is focused through clever use of room layouts - by warping and manipulating space without you being aware of it, Unseen Diplomacy allows you to explore and navigate your way through a much bigger environment - no teleporting or portals required! 

Virtual reality is a unique experience and Unseen Diplomacy is an intense and immersive game designed to offer you a glimpse into espionage life through your own eyes and movements. 

Unseen Diplomacy has received strong attention and interest so we’re really pleased to be able to bring it to Steam in this format. This does mean that it is very much an experiential game - see below for guidelines on how to make the most of Unseen Diplomacy…

VirtuGO is a classic puzzle game. Colored tiles come at you nonstop, and you must put them on your carrying platform and arrange them as best you can on a 5x5 grid. If you match 3,4 or 5 tiles in the same color horizontally, vertically or diagonally, the blocks get destroyed, you score points and free up space for more tiles. 

There are 100 levels in VirtuGO and as you level up, you’ll encounter new color tiles, and they’ll come at you faster and faster. For each 10,000 points you score, you’ll get a WILD tile that you can substitute for any color. Visit the games community page to see the possible combinations and scoring details. 

VirtuGO will get addictive as you try to better your personal best and earn a place on the global leaderboard. Have fun!

The player plays the role of a ranger in the Three Kingdoms period. In the era of disputes, he is free from the edge of the main battlefield, and he tries his best to make justice for the world.

Introduction to the game:

1. Operation: The trigger can be picked up/lowered. The sword can be placed on the side of the body with the bow behind it. In both modes of movement, the left hand disc moves smoothly and the right hand disc sprints.

2. Combat: The main attack and defense mechanisms are in the operation of the player's handle. Players can use weapons to block and attack enemies, or use weapons to destroy flying arrows, use a bow to kill them remotely, and even use arrows to shoot enemy arrows. As long as the operation is good enough, in theory, you can rely on the weapons in your hand to avoid most of the enemy's physical attacks.

3. Weapons: There are 5 categories of weapons that players can use. Each type of weapon has a corresponding powerful skill. It is triggered by the gesture of the handle waving. The trigger gestures of each type of weapon skill are different, such as the combo of the common sword. The power of the bow is scattered.

4. Levels: There are simple scene explorations, organ puzzles, and multiple food items to reply. If you use a torch to burn the fence of the road, use bow and arrow to shoot and trigger some organs, and move the boulder to crack the organs.

5. BOSS Battle: Every three-nation tiger that the player has to face will have a unique combat design. The current level is open to Yan Liang and Wen Chou.

Creep Rides is a pack of 3 virtual reality rides on a track, just like the haunted mansion ride that you may have tried in an amusement park.
It's not a roller coaster.
The first theme ride is a trip to the hell of course if you ben a nasty person.
The second is in an abandoned gold mine that progress in caves with glowing vegetations and creepy creatures.
The third ride is a tour of an old creepy gory castle.
The best way to experience those rides is to sit on a chair.

1- Place a real chair over the virtual (torture) chair at the beginning of the experience.
2- Select a ride by touching one of the magic bubbles, in front of you, with one of your virtual hands or by using your keyboard.
-key a for ride 1.
-key b for ride 2.
-key c for ride 3.
-key r for the main menu.

Make sure that you have a real chair before sitting down in the virtual chair because you might hurt yourself.
Enjoy.

The idea of the game came from all those days and spoiled kids when being in college. When you at college in that bachelor apartment, leaving with your college friends and you wake up in the morning on your own after a Friday night hangover party trying to figure out what to do. You are very bored, but still don’t want to leave the house, then u start to feel that you would like to do something creative around the house just to kill the time. Then you start to go round the house and even do the house is still a mess after last night you are free to do anything. You can mess the house even more up, you can play another round of beer pong on the top level, you can play some more darts on the ground level or just do whatever you would like to do totally free of choice. 
The whole idea of the game was to develop a unique game that is so unique that the player can use his own imagination to move freely around the house. The surrounding and the location the game takes part doesn’t only look, feel like, but even gives the sensation of a real hangover feeling. Even the view that you have outside reminds the player of does days and that feeling of next day hangover and bored numbness .

Kitty Rescue is a fun, light-hearted, 5-10 minute virtual reality experience for all the family. 

Oh dear, Kitty is always getting herself into a pickle. Luckily, you’re here to save the day. You must defy death to save our careless kitten from the dangers of a construction site, rescuing her from 3 perilous scenarios. Hope you don’t have a problem with heights!

1. Window Washer
Kitty has walked onto a rig that was closed for repair and is now swinging about precariously 200 feet in the air. Your mission is to take the working rig down, reach out across the void and snatch kitty from the broken rig to safety. 

2. Walk The Crane
What is Kitty thinking! She's wandered out onto a plank at the top of the crane and is oblivious to the peril she's in. Your mission is to ascend the crane, walk out over the rickety old plank, grab kitty and get her back into the crane.

3. Girder Jump
Kitty had outdone herself this time. She fell asleep on some girders and woke to find herself trapped high up on a ledge. Your mission is to traverse the void, jumping from crane to crane, there and back, to return kitty to safety.

Bonus Skill Level - Complete all three scenarios and grab kitty to begin.

Help Dot the pig roll away from the evil wolf chef, thus ruining his dinner plans. With the help of his father and his brother, you will guide Dot to his beloved Princess Rune.

- Discover crazy worlds: throughout the escape Dot will encounter various environments, from forests, snow mountains to sci-fi and even maybe a little trip to other worlds. Who knows. Maybe he's an astronaut pig. Maybe he's a super pig that can fly.

 - Conquer your skills: unlock a variety of power ups to help Dot throughout his escape, as well as discover new outfits for him to wear that give him extra special bonuses when he wears them. 
Roll, Jump, shoot and dodge. That’s the way the pig goes. 
You can upgrade your power ups in the game using the tomato currency. The more tomatoes you collect while you play, the more you can upgrade your power ups as well as unlock new outfits for Dot! 

- Show off your dance moves: You have trotters instead of your hands! Isn't that a good enough reason to dance?

In a future time where an entire species of conscious machines, the makinæ, lives subdued and enslaved by technological pirates, we have enlisted in the Makina Resistance Army, whose purpose is the makina liberation from pirate tyranny to regain control of Kafke, the land promised to them more than a century ago. But to enter the MRA, we shall pass several tests of skill and dexterity, experimenting with ways to survive and destroy our enemies to obtain bonuses and special achievements that result in higher final scores. 

Dodge, cover yourself, hit, shoot, catch and throw against the deadly waves of pirate drones as MRA Sub-Commander Cornelia's voice introduces you to Kafke's history and walks you through your trial in this historical battle for makina freedom. Enjoy an open desert environment with advanced hi-tech and rusty props as you elevate next to an imposing 200-meter robot statue with the graffiti ""Free The Makinæ"" on its chest. 

We introduce the gappos, named in honor to their discoverer, Dr. Gappo, who has given birth to all this future technology. Gappos are applications that modify in real-time human genetics to provide all kinds of abilities that put humans at the height of makinæ. We will explore defense gappos (Shield), attack gappos (Dual Steel Hand, Blaster), and special gappos (Bullet Time). As you advance in the test missions for the MRA, improve your current gappos and acquire new ones that provide the coolest weapons and abilities to defeat your opponents and unblock the different game modes. 

GAPPO’S LEGACY VR is mixed-reality green screen ready and playing on arcades and cybercafes around the world, and it is the result of thorough testing in events and festivals by over five hundred gamers, developers and casuals, all of which provides an extremely pleasant and intense VR experience for an extensive audience, sickness-free guaranteed. Gappo's Legacy VR is part of a transmedia project which includes a TV series and a comic book in development, and is the first episode into a future saga that will exploit the same cool mechanics with the addition of more story, interactive character narrative, and multi-player co-op.

ea8d4eee-3c9f-4f23-b060-6bc247452e82,Unabomber: The Virtual Reality Experience,¥559,"Description

Join an FBI Task Force to help investigate one of the most challenging murder cases ever.  In this educational narrative adventure produced by the Newseum in partnership with Immersion VR and Vive Studios, you join the team of agents that is trying to track down a mass killer.
 
Starting in 1978 by targeting bombs aimed at universities and airlines, the Unabomber had injured 23 people and killed three by 1995.  It would take cooperation, dedication and innovation to track down this elusive criminal who had waged a 17-year campaign of terror with lethal, homemade bombs.
 
Travel back in time to Task Force headquarters in San Francisco to meet the FBI agent who led the investigation and review the case file.  Help a major newspaper publisher make a decision that could provide a break in the case – or lead to disastrous results.  Enter a remote cabin in the mountains of Montana to defuse a bomb and try to gather the evidence that could put a killer away for life.
 
""Unabomber: The Virtual Reality Experience"" is inspired by and based on the work by the agents who worked on the case, and the example the investigation provided on how law enforcement, the press and the public can work together to fight evil.

Storm is an atmospheric survival game. This is the first, short introduction to a series of episodes of Storm. You wake up in an intense snowstorm. As you look around for ways to get out of the biting cold, to somehow find shelter, your body gets colder, your hands freeze up, and the storm intensifies. And as you slowly move forward a bigger question rises: who are you? Where are you? How did you get here?

Storm is a game about identity, and about destiny. Storm lives somewhere between a film and a game. We were inspired by the visual beauty of extreme environments; an aesthetically beautiful but deadly experience where your body is pushed to the extreme. 

Team Storm VR is made of a small group of friends, and published by renowned production studio UNIT9. Storm is a passion project that we mostly work on in our spare time.  The main character in Storm is voiced by the amazing Tommie Earl Jenkins.

What is home, to you? It sure isn't what it used to be. However blissful your home life, the fact is home is never quite as homely as when you were a kid. Why is that? Because home is your comfort zone, that place you spend half your grown-up hours trying to escape. A place where time marches on, but you can pretend it doesn't. Why not put off proofreading that paper or working on that presentation, and take some time to play God and homemaker to a bunch of paper dolls.

------------------------------------
------------------------------
How to build your VR habitat:
------------------------------
------------------------------------

------------------------------
Interact via Grip button:
------------------------------
Extend your arm and use your virtual hand's grip button to pick up/copy/erase objects. Press again to release/drop object.

------------------------------
Press touch pad to Teleport:
------------------------------
Press the touch pad to teleport to different locations in your habitat under construction

------------------------------
Swipe touch pad to select 
editing tools:
------------------------------
Swipe the touch pad left and right to cycle between Move/Grab/Copy/Erase features for your hand, as well as different construction sets

------------------------------
Construction sets:
------------------------------
While a construction set is in hand, swipe the touch pad up/down to switch to next/previous group of 3x3 palette of pieces. Use your other hand to copy any piece into your habitat.

------------------------------
Glove: Move:
------------------------------
This blue glove allows you to manipulate objects defying conventional physics. Objects picked up while wearing this glove can pass through other solid objects and float in the air.

------------------------------
Glove: Grab:
------------------------------
While wearing this white glove, dropping an object will fall as affected by gravity. Use this to stack a lamp on top of a desk for example. 
Note: overlapping objects, which would be impossible in real life, understandably frustrates our physics engine, causing wildly swinging motions.

------------------------------
Glove: Copy:
------------------------------
While wearing this green glove, any object picked up is duplicated. 

------------------------------
Glove: Erase:
------------------------------
This red glove erases any object picked up

------------------------------
Saving:
------------------------------
Your progress is saved automatically every 30 seconds or so. Please keep in this mind that as a software in development, occasionally we may change the format.


------------------------------
Intro
------------------------------
We are working on a VR sandbox/dollhouse to furnish and decorate your space

Rearrange/stack a growing library of furniture and props like in real life

Powered by physics and your imagination.

We'd love to hear from you

Journey For Elysium is a story-driven VR game inspired by Greek and Roman mythology. Players will take on the role of an unnamed hero who has passed away. He finds himself on a boat in the Underworld trapped between life and death. In order to reach Elysium and obtain redemption, the mysterious traveler must use all his wits and skills in a series of increasingly elaborate twists and challenges. Along the way, he will discover more about his past.

Key features:

- Art style: enjoy the black and white art style inspired by the paintings of Gustave Doré. The high contrast art style fits best in recreating the desired atmosphere of the underworld. In addition, you will find golden highlights here and there, which will guide you further along the way.

- Puzzles: Journey for Elysium brings back the excitement of classic adventures games of the 90’s and revamps them for a new era. Look for clues and solve an increasingly complex range of puzzles, challenges and tests to move the story forward.

- A lot to discover: immerse yourself in a rich world, grounded between history and myth. Explore breathtaking environments and unravel surprising facts of the Classical antiquity. Connect with your senses to this VR storytelling experience.

- Mechanics: travel on the river Styx and explore the underworld with the rowing mechanic, the most important travelling method in the game. This natural way of transportation feels very comfortable and immersive.

- Two modes: when you are not rowing, you can experience two different ways of moving around. The Immersive Mode lets you walk through the world via the analog controls, whereas the Comfort Mode lets you teleport around the world to avoid any VR motion sickness for people prone to it.

Control George, the hapless inhabitant of a sleepy English countryside village, as he gets turned into an undead nightmare, by his own best friend in their final throws at life, before they die; as George goes about  town, his diet changes from jam sandwiches and quavers, to human guts and brains.

You will control George and his ever growing undead horde, depending on how good you are, via a 3D tabletop view of his village. Walk around the landscape, get down low and look down into the streets, place down  target flags to let George know where you want him to wreak havoc.

You have the power to decide which villagers turn and fight for the army of the undead, as long as, you have enough undead to bust through the police barricade  and escape town into the rest of the world in search of more victims.

There are four difficulty levels, each level will determine how many of the living you will need to turn into the undead, to escape the village and progress the apocalypse.

**Warning: This VR title contains a rollercoaster ride and the high-speed twists and turns of the ride will likely induce nausea even in experienced VR users.**

Take a virtual ride on the best and biggest roller coasters of the Oktoberfest - Munich, Germany.
Enjoy the best the Oktoberfest has to offer - other than the beer.

Maybe in real life you wouldn't dare to - here you can!

Real 360-degree Videos - no simulation!
The roller coaster rides were recorded as real authentic 360-degree videos. They are NOT computer generated rides like in many other apps.

Virtual reality and the Oktoberfest
Your certainly know the world famous Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany.
Maybe you even visited there.
If so, you must have seen the Olympic roller coaster there.
It is not only the greatest roller coaster but the greatest attraction of the Oktoberfest altogether. Other than the beer 
Just looking at it makes many people feel sick. You can hardly imagine how it feels to ride through the five huge Olympic rings, head over heels, one after another with up to 100 kilmeters an hour.
With VR glasses and this app you can enjoy this breath taking ride, safely and comfortably.
You get the real riding experience of the full 1200 meter route of the Olympia roller coaster and the other roller coasters of the Oktoberfest.
During the ride you can move your Head into every direction, even up and down. If you are sitting on a revolving chair, you can also turn around 360 degrees. This is a lot of fun and would be virtually impossible during a real roller coaster ride.
And it is totally cool that you can take the ride as often as you want to - again and again! No additional costs 

Other than the Olympia roller coaster there are more rides included!: The Wilde Maus (Wild Mouse), that is famous for its sudden changes of direction and the Alpina roller coaster, another fast ride in virtual reality.

Inspired by classics of the genre, Vengeful Rites aims to bring a proper adventure to Virtual Realty. With an average campaign length of around 15 hours and replayability in the form of different weapon, ring and perk combinations, you'll be engrossed in your quest for some time. Specialize in swords, bows or magic to dominate your foes in the way that best suits your playstyle and achieve your vengeance on your own terms! You've got everything you need to accomplish your task. Your journey awaits...

Smooth/Teleportation locomotion supported.

Main Features Include:
A story of vengeance!
The fallen Serafin, Dragore, returns to slay Abardon, his former brother-in-arms and your master. It falls to you to seek him out and exact your revenge lest the world fall prey to Dragore's pending invasion!

Master your swordsmanship!
Melee enemies are quick to react and to catch you off guard. Master the blade and overcome deadly foes by parrying and cutting them down. No waggling to win here!

Powerful and intuitive magic!
You're not limited to simple swords and bows...you've got the power of Serafin magic right at your finger tips! Use intuitive gestures to summon shields, throw fireballs, heal yourself, knock back enemies and more!

Specialize in different combat disciplines!
Acquire Elixirs of the Gods to earn perk points that make you more proficient with swords, bows, magic or any combination of the three. Unlock ultimate perks to dual wield, master powerful spells or gain the ability to imbue your arrows with magical properties! Talk about replayability...

Enchant your swords for greater control of the fight!
Meteorites have crashed all around the world since Dragore's return. Find them and gather their shards to sharpen your blades, enchanting them with the ability to ignite, chill, electrify, steal mana or health! Use the shards that best suit your playstyle!

Solve ancient riddles and puzzles!
There are hidden treasures everywhere. Brawn won't get you everything; you'll need brains to remove the obstacles that would bar your path and uncover ancient treasures long forgotten.

Defeat epic bosses!
Dragore's not the only one you have to worry about! His lieutenants and their soldiers promise to make your task as difficult as possible. Learn their weaknesses and take them down on your quest to save the world and bring Dragore to justice!

Craft your way to victory!
Found a hidden recipe? Bring it to a forge and make yourself a new sword! Defeating a boss earned you a shiny new gem? Use it to make a powerful ring with a passive bonus to better customize your playstyle!

Join the conversation!
You'll come across some talkative characters throughout your adventure. Talk back with speech recognition for more immersive NPC interactions!

Kira is a FREE mini-experience that immerses users in a Faerie workshop full of mysterious structures, magical devices, and colorful beasts. 

This experience is designed to highlight the immersive qualities of VR for friends and family, allowing them to explore each nook and cranny of a fantasy scene. Kira was originally designed as a way-point navigation experiment and so the only interaction is moving from place to place in the environment. 

Its a simple experience and not intended to be experienced as a 'game' but it's a project that we really liked so we wanted to share.

How long have these goggles been pressing into my flesh?

What began as a small game jam between William Pugh (The Stanley Parable), Dominik Johann (Minit), and Justin Roiland (Rick and Morty) is now—two years later—an aberration of warped technology, weird worlds, and strange, disturbing creatures. Since its debut in 2016 (10/10 on Steam), Accounting has tripled in size, mutating into an intricate labyrinth of forbidden virtual realities. There are countless more secrets to discover if you have the stomach to brave the dangers of new characters, brought to life by an ever expanding cast of comedic legends (Rich Fulcher, Reggie Watts and Justin Roiland, to name a few).

Accounting is a noble profession. During your tenure with Smith & Smitherson, you will bare witness to the afterbirth of this new facet of human experience. However, it is not without its dangers. Here are some of the warnings you need to be aware of before beginning your adventure into Accounting+.

DANGERS

If you die in VR, you die in real life.
Do not play after midnight.
Do not look directly into the eyes of any characters.
Achievements linked to unforgivable acts of human corruption.
A soundtrack that is way better than a VR game soundtrack should have any right to be.
Subtitles and translations for 9 languages… Oh, wow, that’s internationally dangerous.
The vacuum of space. Dangerous. Yeah, that’s dangerous.
Sitting and Standing Mode are BOTH available (and dangerous)!
And, unfortunately: The Cops.
(also playable on Oculus Rift)

Eggcellent VR is inspired by an old Mickey Mouse egg catching game on Nintendo Game & Watch platform. In the very core of the game sits arcade culture with constantly challenging levels. Game features additional game modes that are not related to egg catching to make the game more content full and entertaining.

Features
Game accessibility - Very easy to understand but hard to master
Challenge - constantly growing difficulty will make you entertained for a long time

Satisfaction - there is nothing more satisfying than perfectly completing a level and seeing those little cute chicken bumping their heads on each other in attempt to run (No, not really)

Three different gaming modes:

Classic Egg catcher - catch as many eggs as you can (those chicks may get a little wild sometimes)
Fishing - Because why wouldn't we add it?
Cow protection - Protect you cows from constant waves of UFO trying to steal it (Because it makes a perfect sense.)
(also playable on Oculus Rift)

Clazer is a simulation that allows you to experience the art of sport shooting from the comfort and convenience of virtual reality. As soon as you don the head gear, you are transported to authentic environments with real shotgun physics. You aim your shotgun, pull the trigger, and blast the clay! 

Clazer uses technology, patented by LeadTech, that teaches you the proper way to lead a target so you can accurately hit it. Real physics are integrated that actually simulate the ballistics of various types of shot. Professional sport shooters have already provided enthusiastic feedback. Clazer is so accurate that it will improve your ability to shoot real targets using an actual shotgun.

Clazer includes three separate sport shooting types: 
Skeet
Trap
Five Stand Sporting Clays

You have access to a practice mode that helps to better visualize missed shot trajectory. Competition modes for Skeet, Trap, and Five Stand integrate professional rules and guidelines. 

Coming Soon: 
LeadTech is working on a solution that will support the use of peripheral guns and real guns in Clazer - In VR!

Endless Current is an alien universe. It plunges you into a micro-world akin to the inside of a biological cell, or perhaps flings you to the outer corners of the universe. You can explore without limit, in any direction, inside and outside of an infinite architecture. Move in the direction your wand is facing by squeezing the trigger -- start gently, go only as you feel comfortable. You may find singing alien creatures surround you, searching for food, digesting, perishing, or reproducing. Tens of thousands of mutating particles drift in the fluid surrounding you. You can collect them to feed to the creatures, and feel how they snatch the nutrients from you. Watch as they digest them and grow! Every element of the world is on constant regeneration and linked within a vast feedback system, with all movements influenced by its endless currents.

Endless Current is part of the research-creation project ""Artificial Nature"", by Haru Ji & Graham Wakefield.

Take a break from reality. Mio Garden offers up a calming Virtual Reality experience unlike any other. Interact with a series of mini games or sit down, relax and meditate against the backdrop of a never-ending sunset. 

Mio Garden transports you to a room scale, meditative experience, immersing you in a world where you’ll lose yourself in a permanent sunset. A brief tutorial will teach how to move around our magical world, where lanterns will help you teleport to different sections of our interactive environment. 

Lose yourself in the magic of floating, musical umbrellas that transform your world through sound. Recapture the nostalgic feeling of catching fireflies, with fireflies that multiply as you try to ensnare them in your net. Can you kendama? Don’t give into frustration. Play the classic ball-and-cup game. Maybe you’ll nail it on the first try, maybe it’ll take you a few. We also have a set of balls, which when returned to our pond, trigger a magical, colorful experience. 

Two paths take you through the garden, but you’ll always wind up in the same destination, playing drums to an audience of one: a silent samurai statue who stands guard over this magical environment. He may be intimidating, but no matter what your musical skill, he’ll be fair in his judgement. 

We created this experience as an alternative to some of the more exhilarating, heart-pumping VR experiences we’ve encountered. We want your experience within the garden to slow things down, and help you unwind. This is a great experience to share with first-timers or people who have previously had negative experiences in VR, as well as for those who have hungrily devoured every interactive experience available.

Mind Unleashed is a first person Sci Fi shooter game specifically designed for Virtual Reality. You are a robot that is trying hard to survive in a secret military base, inside a rocky mountain. Rocks and futuristic stuff will surround you in this epic challenge where you'll need to survive as long as possible, fighting hordes of robotic enemies. Pick up very advanced weapons, take cover and wait the right time to destroy your enemy and play with strategy if you want to survive! In Mind Unleashed ARENA there are 15 waves of enemies to defeat in order to win. Each waves will be progressively harder with more robots and/or stronger robots with different weapons, aesthetics, speeds, damages, health and special abilities. Choose the class fit best your skills: Engineer, Assault or Specialist. Each skill offers its own play-style with 2 different abilities. If the player destroys all the enemies of a wave, an alarm will alert him that a new wave is going to be spawned. The player has 10 seconds before the new wave spawns. They can take advantage of this delay to find health packs, ammo etc. The main objective of the game is to reach the 15th wave of enemies and defeat the last boss.Of course the game will allow unlimited game play after victory. As other objectives that could help the player to accomplish the first, Special ""rooms"" are available that have inside 2 or more health packs and weapons for a quick restock. Since the game natively supports VR headsets like the Oculus Rift, we're making sure the game is as immersive as possible, motion sickness free and comfortable. We're adopting a smart UI system to make everything readable within the VR headsets. We also paying particular attention to make choices that perfectly fit and surprise the player while playing in VR. This means that we're trying to make the game as spectacular and interesting as possible, also on a visual side trying to encourage the player to explore each zone of the map and each area. The game is also optimized as much as possible to play perfectly smooth even on high demand VR headsets. Also, since the default controller for VR (Especially Oculus) is the Xbox game pad,we're fully supporting the Xbox 360/One game pad AND the keyboard+mouse. However, the game automatically detects if an headset is turned on or off and it will start the game accordingly. Features STRATEGIC / STEALTH OR AGGRESSIVE APPROACHES Play both with a more strategic / stealth approach or a more direct one. Beware that you'll be alone with waves of enemies, so in same cases be more silent could be a smart idea! DYNAMIC GROUND AND AERIAL COMBAT Hide between objects quietly or quickly fly in the air to destroy the enemies avoiding their shots, your choice! HIGHLY REPLAYABLE Re-playable almost ad infinitum, improve your previous performance and try to reach the next wave without dying. DEEP AND FUTURISTIC ATMOSPHERES Use your flash light if needed and enjoy this deep and futuristic atmosphere that will completely immerse you. 3 DIFFERENT AREAS 3 different areas to explore. You'll be able to unlock them going further through enemy waves. Each of them have its own different style. 3 DIFFERENT CLASSES Choose from 3 different classes: Engineer, Assault or Specialist and use their special abilities to let you destroy them all! BOSS AND DYNAMIC AIs Fight against different kinds of enemy waves with different AIs and pay particular attention to the bosses. You'll need to destroy them using more strategy and accuracy.

Ever worked hundreds of meters beneath the earth, bent down in dark, narrow shafts, hitting coal out of the walls? Probably not. Now you can: The WDR, Germany’s largest public broadcaster, presents the interactive VR experience “Meet the Miner – WDR VR Bergwerk”. With an Oculus Rift, users can experience how dangerous and grueling life of a miner was 100 years ago – feeling what it was like racing down hundreds of meters into the earth in a shaky elevator and mining coal with a virtual pickaxe. Something you will never be able to do in real life again. It is the highlight of a VR/360° project focussing on a dying tradition – the last German coal mines shut down by the end of 2018.

Gameplay Overview
Each player has an army of dwarves and catapults. There are 3 kinds of dwarves, each has a different movement pattern. You can move each of your units once per turn. Catapults are neutral, if you control units next to it, you may shoot the catapult once per turn.

#SelfieTennis is much more than a tennis game with a really nice physics simulation and great AI, accessible to players of ALL ages and with ZERO motion sickness. 

You play against yourself on a tennis court in the clouds, with Ball People surrounding you and messing around together with you. Their AI can be described as highly sophisticated, funny, stupid, and other things. 

For hardcore tennis fans, we made the best physics system that we could, and tennis pros have confirmed that it is indeed a pretty good simulation, but without all the hassles of real life, such as running after the balls or not shooting at other people. 

For people who enjoy playing in their own rhythm and not following rules, the game has a perfect mix of funky sandboxy upgrades such as: #lightsaber, #violins, #selfies, #bow and #arrows for that #archery mood, #ponycorn to let you move around on horse back (stick), and #hearts to break (to get more upgrades). 

We now support the HTC Racket tracker peripheral! Start the game with it activated and you can play two-handed (or dual-wield rackets) for an intense workout - the Ball People will take care of your balls, you just have to spank them!

Instructions
You use the triggers to spawn the ball(s) and racket. Double-click on racket trigger to lock it. You can change controller hands on the small button above the touchpad. Knock #BallPeople off the court and take their hearts to enter #HeartAttack mode (time-limited upgrades).

SAFETY IS KING: Controllers can fly, SO WEAR WRIST STRAPS! 

For cheats, use google! We <3 cheats ;)

A few cheats on the house (on keyboard):
- B: for High Balls serve mode 
- E: for Enio ball (experimental - for higher visibility)
- K: for Kids mode (don't cheat, if you're an adult...by age) 
- S: deactivate the #SelfieStick 
- M: turn off Music 
- Arrow keys: rotate play space 
- HAHAHA: Laugh at your friends for extra hearts!

Us VRUnicorns are hardcore jammers and we're constantly jamming on new and fun features for #SelfieTennis. Let us know of any crazy ideas, wacky features and tricks/cheats you would like us to add. We’re a tiny team game jamming our way through life, so we can’t promise that all features will make it in, but cool ideas should be tried.

MUSEUM MODE:

Stonehenge VR began its journey as a profound learning experience, enjoyed by thousands of families, when it originated as one of the first room scale VR exhibits on display in a museum. The first location was the Pacific Science Center in Seattle, Washington, and the second was the Museum at Prairiefire in Overland Park, Kansas.

Build, paint and knock down your own version of the Stonehenge monument with motion controllers in real time. Design your own ancient monument around the original Stonehenge, or delete it and start in an empty field. 

The SANDBOX is user friendly for the beginner with many tools to discover, and three types of locomotion options for the more experienced VR user. Many additional pre-made monuments for you to explore come built in to the Stonehenge VR SANDBOX.

THE DEVELOPER:

After having his mind blown by VR in 2013, and seeing how the tech could be used for education, Christian Bretz decided to change careers and went looking for financing to start his first VR project. When he wasn't able to get the financing necessary to hire a developer, he decided to teach him self how to develop VR software in the Unreal Engine using tutorials and information he found online.

Three months later he created the first version of Stonehenge VR, and less than a year after that it became one of the first room scale VR exhibits to ever be displayed in a museum. 

First was the Pacific Science Center in Seattle, WA, then the Museum at Prairiefire in Overland Park, KS. It also became a launch title for HTC’s Viveport and has been featured by many tech and media publications such as, CNet, Variety and VRScout.

Christian and his Co-Founder Jessica Villarreal design all the software, and run the business themselves all out of their home in Los Angeles, CA.

Hopalong: The Badlands is a VR game where violence and comedy combine with a one-of-a-kind movement system. Hop, skip, or simply wave your stick horse up and down to gallop smoothly through the western landscape filled with the villainous group known as the Dynamite Gang. They are beyond redemption and there is no “or Alive” part on their wanted posters.

Features
	•  Oscillot locomotion system for intuitive movement through the landscape
	•  Murderous stick-horse riding outlaws made out of wood.
	•  Fight Boss Boomity and his flying stick-pig Pigasus in an intense night time battle.
	•  Earn new stick horses as you progress, even Pigasus!
	•  Dodge dynamite or shoot it while it's in the air back at the imbecile that threw it.
	•  Enemies with Gatling guns? Run!

Weapons
	•  Eight Shooter - One more than seven bullets means one more than seven bandits headed for a dirt nap. 
	•  Pickaxe - Like a normal axe but for rocks. Or bandits. Mostly bandits. 
	•  Double-Barrel - Why shoot a bullet when you can blow a bunch of hot metal out of, not only one, but two barrels? Not to mention Jolene is one pretty lady.
	•  Sniper Rifle - Long gun, long range. 'Nough said.
	•  Dynamite - You only need a pinch to blow up a bandit. Good you've got a whole stick of it.
	•  Iron Falcon - Big bullets for when you have big problems. Oh, and they explode.
	•  Brimstone Gun - For when its dark, or when you need to light a bandit on fire. Which ever comes first.

Get ready to raze hell and become an explosives expert / demolition worker in MIRROR QUEEN's latest game: BRING IT DOWN!

BRING IT DOWN! challenges the player to demolish structures given a limited supply of explosives. Your grasp on physics will be heavily disputed as you make your way through a variety of levels and weapons.

Your weapons of choice: 

The CHARGE LAUNCHER is the quintessential razing tool, letting you set up explosives before detonating them in a single chain reaction. Gravity affects the charges more than any other type of ammo, so it's important to aim a little higher than you normally would aim if you're trying to aim accurately. Your charges can also bounce, so ricochet them off walls to get to hard to reach areas.

The HAND CANNON is a brute-force tool of destruction, capable of launching high-mass cannonballs at breakneck speeds. What it lacks in explosive power can be regained through its sheer force and quantity. Cannonballs have the increased power needed to knock obstacles out of the way and off the building platform for maximum bonus points.

The GUIDED BAZOOKA is a strange, but intensely accurate weapon capable of hitting buildings from any angle. Launch a rocket in the direction of your choosing then use the attached laser sight to guide the rocket to the place of detonation. Strategic users might even find that they can shoot the rocket beyond the structure then have it change course to attack from the rear.

Introduction
Odyssey VR is a story driven space adventure single/multiplayer game experience that you can play on Desktop or in Virtual Reality (VR). The environment allows the explorer to experience different tasks in a spaceship. The tasks include locating and handling different tools and protecting the spaceship from asteroid fields. At the end of the playable experience, the explorer can review their performance and improve their personal or social score by playing again. The game is multi-modal and allows explorers to learn interesting facts about space through narrative and audio.

A maximum of three explorers per session can experience a post-apocalyptic world after the Earth became unable to sustain life. Be a crew member of a large space station inhabited by a group of scientists in search of a new home. The scientists hope to preserve parts of the Earth’s biodiversity in isolated ecosystem bubbles connected to the station. You must protect the ecosystem bubbles, because they carry the last remaining plants and animals from Earth. Travel through space and look for the answers, because humanity is counting on you.

Controls
The experience works both in desktop and Virtual Reality using HTC VIVE. There is an in-game option to switch between the two versions. The experience is fully functional using either one. However, there are slight differences in movement controls and user interactions.

Development of Odyssey VR
This indie adventure experience was developed and will develop along the way. Currently, the game supports only HTC VIVE VR headsets. However, you can still play it with a regular desktop computer and a screen. It was developed mostly at the Virtual Reality Association in Helsinki, who donated working spaces and an opportunity to develop, test and gather feedback for the experience. Now, we would like to receive feedback, to learn and do better. We believe that outer space and science is something we all could participate in, do research for, dream about, travel to, and wonder about. May the eternal flame guide you!
(also playable on Oculus Rift)

An experiment to become invisible. A bomb to cover it up if I fail. And a mistake that left me only 15 minutes before the bomb detonation. My name is Frol Blok and this is the beginning of my story.

Frol Blok - quest-room that is inspired by an old-school quests. Stuffing that is made out of non-linear story, narrative and charismatic protagonist is waiting for you. Independent scientist from snowy Santa-Beria and simply adventurer-opportunist who is always ready to comment out everything with a couple of useful (and not really) one thoughts. At the same time, VR technology enables to add mechanics of climbing, detail examinations of finds and force affect on environment except classical items finding and combination.

It’s a small game, but if you like it the story will be continued.

Key Features:

Non-linear story.
Both endings will be achieved only by the most crazy scientists;

High replayability.
Next try will be much funnier because of generator that will swap the room content randomly;

High level of interaction.
Burn and break, pull and climb, combine and make that work;

Narrative stuffed.
Frol is a grouchy person, but you will team up. His story and surrounding world have very addictive atmosphere.

You will find yourself amid one of the biomes that could be met in the world we are working on. This dark savage forest is full of dangerous creatures. Such tree zones became a home of giant spiders that are much more intelligent than those from our world are.

These arachnids have their own society and control all the area around. Using holes in the ground, they move fast and free across uncharted lands. Their jumping ability makes them scary and unpredictable enemies.

Thank to Conway's bright intelligent, he could found a way to keep them on a distance — special light from lamp stands scares off the beasts and creates safe paths.

STORY:

The second half of the XX century. After months of successful researches and expeditions, William Conway is ready to share with the scientific world not only the fascinating Teleportation technology he discovered but also a completely new world this invention leads to.

With his loyal companions, William prepared a safe area amid the vast alien lands. Now he needed to check everything one last time, and write a good speech. This place may not be perfect: everything creaks, sparkles, and there’s no hot water, but how could such a thing stop a true pioneer?

This new world keeps its secrets under layers of different mist, full of unknown creatures and mysteries to solve.

Giving a last look from the observation deck, Conway could not expect what a journey lies ahead. Once shared his blood with this world, William starts an ancient ritual. Your blood has power here, but Blood Magic always attracts creatures even more dangerous than local monsters — you have to finish what you started until it is too late, there is no other way... Is it?

On our moon-based research facility you will take a trip to Wildcat Den, where we learn about the formation of Earth in caves and caverns. The Lunar Research Facility is a fun place to learn as you travel to distant lands and even get to play with the fish in our hologram aquarium. 

Then enter our liquid surround display as you experience the formation of water all around you. In virtual reality, the water cycle comes alive as you are immersed in it’s vast capabilities. 

As always, Wendy the Science Teacher provide a fun lesson in science and ecology. Not enough fun? Well, enter Trickybeard’s Cave and challenge the ol’ pirate to a game with his treasure chests.  It’s your memory against his clock for all the treasure he has. 

We have one more movie to experience as a variety of dogs give us a tour of how the Earth’s crust was formed. In fact, we learn that the ground underneath us is constantly moving, even if we don’t realize it. 

For teachers and parents, this unit is fun, but it also covers multiple Next Gen Science Standards on the top of Earth Systems in the Earth & Space category. This unit includes 3 built-in assessments.

Neverout is an unique puzzle game with innovative mechanics and immersive, unsettling atmosphere. The game puts the player in a small, claustrophobic cube, with only one way out. Will you survive?

With the possibility of turning the whole level around, you still have to watch for obstacles such as electric fields or spiked pits. Teleports and movable blocks will certainly help, but it all really depends on your wits and careful decisions!

Feed A Titanosaur is the ideal introduction to VR for a first time user and remains a favourite which people recall months later.

Customers will love this experience and be talking about it well after they leave the venue! It is easy to control, delightfully original and has a couple of very nice surprises all in a five minute timeframe. An informative voice over guides users through the experience.

About the experience 
Come face to face with one of the largest creatures to ever walk planet Earth and feed it! The object of this bite-sized educational project is to allow amazing facts to be delivered in an immersive VR experience, with a focus on our Titanosaur – Argentinosaurus.

We love to innovate. In developing interactive installations for visitor centres, museums and galleries we always aim to bring original concepts to life in new ways. This project blends the simple concept of dinosaur interaction with a friendly, highly detailed 3D mesh model, animating realistically and adjusting it’s poses based on the player’s actions – all delivered using an HTC Vive at room scale. 

As a result the team has delivered a memorable VR experience blending incredible facts with moments of surprise and delight. In addition, running on an HTC Vive allows participants to move around the prehistoric landscape and inspect this Titanosaur up close using ‘dash’ teleport.

Sir David Attenborough launched this experience last year at York Museum as part of their Yorkshire’s Jurassic World exhibition and now for the first time it has been released for VR arcade and educational use. It is the ideal introduction to VR for first time VR arcade users. The experience is around five minutes in length.


“Tremendous… I imagine every child for miles around will want to see it!”
Sir David Attenborough.


We have tried to price the experience at a level which makes great sense to arcade businesses and to encourage as wide an uptake as possible.

Distant Nightmare will immerse you in a dark and mysterious world thanks to VR. The game puts you in the shoes, and on the bike, of a child in a nightmare. 
Your objective is to cycle through the unexplored environments of your mind in hopes to survive the night and wake up the next day. 

As you cycle through this VR world you will explore new environments, new creatures and challenges, as well as unlock a variety of bikes worthy of elusive nightmares and cycling demons. And if you want to push yourself even more and test your focus while you slumber and cycle, try the time trial mode where collecting time is the only way to survive. That’s if surviving the nightmare is even an option...

So how far will you get, and what bikes (maybe not just bikes…) will you unlock to guide you through your gloomy dream. Will you hide in a corner and cry while you wait for the sand man, or will you get on your bike and ride through hell. The choice is yours.

In the dark blue sky you keep
And often through my curtains peep
For you never shut your eye,
‘til the sun is in the sky...

e2e7ab77-a530-4460-97b1-04e2d3ae472f,Sisyphus' s Toy House,¥113,"Description

As one of the 4 nominated games for Best VR Game in the 2016 China Indie Game Carnival, Sisyphus' s Toy House is a VR Room Escape game. 
 
【Story】

In Greek mythology, Sisyphus offended the gods and was punished to ceaselessly roll a rock up a hill, only watch it roll back down and to repeat the action for eternity. It is an endless cycle. 
  
Looking inside ourselves, perhaps every one of us is a Sisyphus? Every now and then, we lock ourselves, close our minds and are haunted by loneliness. When struggling to break away, we may desperately find ourselves being forced back to where we started, like Sisyphus was. 
 
In this game, you would experience a Sisyphean cycle. Try to get hold of your destiny, break the cycle and find your way out! 
 
【Features of this game】

1.    Synchronization
The player would be locked in a multi-level-nested house. All manipulation on the small-sized model house would simultaneously take effect on the big house where the player stays in, and vice versa. Thus a mix strategy of working on both the small house and big house is needed. 

2.    Cyclic Ending
Conventional way of escaping would only lead the player to reach another level of space, falling into an endless cycle. Try to understand the mechanism of the game, pay attention to hints and unlock the hidden victorious ending. 

【Tips for playing】

Hold  Trigger  to pick up objects. 
 
Hope you enjoy the escape and unlock the hidden victorious ending.

Wheelchair Simulator throws you into “slightly” inaccessible city on two wheels while being accompanied by sarcastic jokes and stories from the life of (the very much real) Dmytro Schebetyuk

Dmytro suffered a spinal injury seven years ago, and is now a wheelchair user. The incident hasn’t stopped him from having a full life - doing extreme wheelchair stunts, travel and even hitchhike around the world. He also loves swimming and archery — he even won a place in the Ukraine’s national Paralympic archery team. He saw the city from a completely different angle and realized that it didn’t suit the needs of people like him.

We believe that power of VR can help battle real world issues by putting you literally in other people’s shoes. Or, in this particular case, a wheelchair. Experience the world from the different perspective and help us battle inaccessibility in Ukraine.

 
Features:
 
- True story and interactive narration 
The story is written and voiced by Dmytro Schebetyuk who suffered spinal injury that bound him to wheelchair but hasn’t stopped him from having a full life. He shares his thoughts, cracks jokes and sarcastically comments on your actions and failings.

- Unique locomotion system 
Push the wheels with your hands and try to keep balance of the wheelchair in VR. Turns out it’s even harder than it looks! 

- Comedic gameplay and ludicrous levels
The game does not focus on disability but rather on fun situations being in wheelchair puts you in. 

- Charity cause 
Profits from the game are donated to Доступно UA (https://www.facebook.com/dostupnoukraine/) initiative which supports accessibility programs and films video blogs about infrastructure and life of people with disabilities in Ukraine.

What happens when a time machine goes crazy? Avoiding dangerous time paradoxes, your only hope is to repair the machine between the time rewinds. 

The antimatter instability causes a black wave of time-distortion, bringing you back in time: each time the cyber world will be populated by yourself and your past alter-egos. 
They will replicate all the actions you previously did, and being seen by them will cause a mortal time paradox.

It’s 11pm, and you are at the last house on your route. The lights are on, and the front door is opened. But, the windows are all boarded up and the grass is overgrown. It seems like a strange place to deliver a pizza, but at least, it looks like someone is home. 

You run to the front door since it’s storming pretty bad. 

“Hello!? Your pizza's here!"" You announce. No one answers. There's an eerie silence. 

You are getting soaked from the rain, so you hesitantly step inside the door and look around. The front door suddenly closes behind you. 

You just wanted to finish this last delivery and head home for the night. Now you must figure out how to get out of this stupid creepy house. 

Freely roam the house and try to figure out what is going on. Three dolls and a strange girl named Emily will also start roaming the house as the hours toll by. Stay away from them, but if you do end up in a room with one, figure out how to stay alive.

54313cad-163c-4102-8128-eeea6e001039,Kartong - Death by Cardboard!,"¥1,400","Description

In a twisted world best described as ”a miniature cardboard city turned into a malicious science experiment”, you find yourself captured against your will by an oddly charming but mysterious YouTuber that goes by the name ""Sven"" in the deadly city of Kartong. Your life now depends on mediocre office supply-weapons and your every move is being filmed for his YouTube enjoyment - a truly odd experience, all wrapped up in challenging stealth/FPS gameplay. And oh, did we mention that you’re shrunk to the size of a toilet paper roll? Yes, you’re small... very small.

Kartong - Death by Cardboard! combines the cuteness of scary toys with the charm of paper cuts - all wrapped up in challenging miniature/stealth/FPS gameplay (that’s a legit genre, right?).

New Progression and Skins!
No worries, no loot boxes here! However, to upgrade your crossbow you need Robo-Coins. These coins can be obtained by smacking some robot-butt! Each time you slay a robot they will drop coins that can be gathered to upgrade your crossbow throughout the game. Hasta la vista, baby!

Life never gets easier!
So, you managed to find your way out of the city? Well, it ain't over yet pal. Kartong’s many difficulty levels will push you to the limit of your own madness. We would say “Prepare To Die”, but that’s a bit cliche now ain’t it?

Become the ultimate maze-warrior!
Kartong features a a local high score system for each difficulty as well, with seeds to control the map. So now you can challenge friends for the best scores, get the sweetest upgrades and show off your rarest loot!

You like watching them and so do we!
With Kartong we’ve figured out a way to put your favorite influencers into the deadly cardboard world! Custom-made “Co-Labs”-maps will monthly feature different highlights that you can easily enter and play to your heart's content.

A game jam gone horribly wrong!
After launching our previous title SVRVIVE: The Deus Helix, our dev team held a ""lets-go-bonkers"" game jam to blow off some steam. Obviously troubled by some very disturbing thoughts (disclaimer: we blame office air pollution), our team came up with Kartong. And once conceived, we had no choice but to bring yet another unpronounceable game to the world.

The learning adventures in this science curriculum unit include the opportunity to pilot a spaceship, as well as a Mars Rover while learning some of the most important lessons about the Universe. 

Along the way, you will meet Wendy, the Science Teacher, who presents lessons at a high school level in a fun and impactful way. You will also meet Steve, the virtual field trip host, who teaches about the solar eclipse in real time as it occurs above you. Even more, you will drive a Rover over the surface of Mars and visit replicas of the actual U.S. Rovers intentionally left there. While traveling to distant galaxies, enjoy watching an animated short about the birth of a star.

The Story
The future. It is 2753. The last decades have been devoted to the creation of an perfect artificial intelligence called P.A.I. The main purpose of it’s creation was to control central military station. The experiment seemed successful. The system did not give a single failure for 3 years of continuous operation. Most of the pilots were sent to Earth, only young trainees remained on patrol.
After some time there began to occur interruptions in connection with artificial intelligence of station. Finally, the connection with station was completely lost. The highest military authority under the control of the Earth immediately sent to the scene a team of the best technicians to determine the cause of the loss of communication and its early restoration. For several days, contact with them has been lost and there is no news.

Since its launch, Sairento VR has been gaining fans worldwide with its unique locomotion system. It is the one game in VR that allows you to experience the iconic ""bullet-time"" scenes from The Matrix, blended with the slow-motion mayhem of the Max Payne game series, all while looking and feeling as badass as the Bride from Kill Bill. 

In Sairento VR, you play a cyber ninja. Perform triple jumps, wall runs, power slides, back flips and slow down time while blasting away at a foe before landing to deliver a lethal strike on another. Kit yourself with your weapons of choice - katanas, firearms, bows, throwing glaives - they are all at your disposal.

Popular gamers like Node call it their ‘favourite VR game’ and Nathie, Cix Liv, JoshDub, TimDotTV and more all give it a thumbs up.

Sairento VR was designed to be easy to pick up, but tough to master. The more time you spend with Sairento VR, the better you will perform the moves in the game and the more you will be rewarded with the unparalleled feeling of being the action hero of a big budget movie production. 


- GET TRANSFORMED INTO A DEADLY CYBER NINJA - 

Sairento VR is a mission-driven, VR action role-playing game set in a re-imagined Japan in the near future. In Sairento, you play as a member of the Silent Ones - a righteous but covert organization of seemingly ordinary people who practice the long forsaken code and martial arts of the ancient samurai and ninjas.

Crafted painstakingly to provide an engaging and visually stunning first-person sword-fighting and gunplay - expect awesome weaponry, intuitive controls, challenging levels, menacing enemies and beautiful environments in your fight to restore order to the world.

Get transformed into a mighty ninja warrior with an arsenal of ancient weapons with a futuristic twist and engage an endless horde of enemies across different locations.


- GAME FEATURES - 
  
Chosen to be a Silent One for your outstanding character and trained by a sensei skilled in the art of ancient Japanese martial arts and modern fighting, you not only wield a mean katana, but are also skillful with guns and projectile weapons. Built for non-stop slash and shoot action, Sairento aims to set a new standard in VR games in terms of excitement and engagement.

• Have fun slashing and shooting away by yourself in single-player Missions or Campaign Mode, or go head-to-head against others in multiplayer 4v4 PVP and PVE modes.

• A complete locomotion system - Walk or run, leap 15 feet into the air, perform multiple jumps, run across walls, power slide across the floor and perform back flips like only a true action super star could.

• Engage enemies using our innovative combat system, allowing you to fight in slow motion and parry incoming projectiles like a boss.

• Cut your enemies down with blade beams from your katana or simply do it the old fashioned way. Blast them to smithereens with good old fashioned guns. Demolish them with explosive arrows. Take them down with kunais and shurikens or slaughter them with a glaive. It's entirely up to you.

• Keep upgrading your abilities and weapons as you accumulate experience from completing missions. Become the true ninja warrior hero you've always wanted to be.

• Traverse a reimagined futuristic Japan in unique oriental locations.

• Soak yourself in blood-pumping, exhilarating music as you become God in your own action movie.

22f060f9-4bda-4084-868c-66ee72e4cda9,EscapeVR: Trapped Above the Clouds,"¥1,220","Description

You find yourself locked in a penthouse - in a mile high building that reaches above the clouds but is still partly under construction. Not everything seems to be working as expected... you might just have to do some construction work yourself, or even nick some equipment from that canceled base jump event on the roof...

EscapeVR: Trapped Above the Clouds is an 'Escape The Room' genre game which was inspired by real-life escape games and written from the ground up as a room-scale virtual reality experience.

Your goal: Escape! - by solving over a dozen puzzles, which require you to apply logical thinking, discover clues, find and use the correct objects, and -last but not least- having the courage to do slightly crazy things.

'Trapped Above the Clouds' is the second installment of the EscapeVR series and has all-new rooms and puzzles and is longer, larger and more challenging than the first game, EscapeVR: The Basement.

Features:

* Explore three distinct areas with a total of over 800 square meters, and more than 250 items to interact with.
* The game is designed for room scale and features a teleporting system. Look, feel, and ambiance of the game are based on corresponding real-life environments.
* In case you get stuck, a built-in hint system provides you with clues. You’ll also get in-game statistics about your performance. 

Will you take on the challenge? Will you manage to escape - above the clouds?

Paddle Master VR is a cross between a breakout-style game and racquetball, inspired by a popular mobile game (Ballz). You play inside something like a racquetball court, but with numbered blocks that you must destroy. You have a gun that you use to shoot balls at the blocks, and a paddle to keep the balls in play when they bounce back to you. When your balls are all gone, your gun is automatically reloaded, and a new row of blocks appears, and any old blocks are moved closer to you. You lose when any blocks get pushed past the red line marking the front of the play area. Oh, and the balls have a tendency to explode... How long can you last?

Key Of Impasse is a VR room escape game.
Players will be trapped in a closed room and get a 30-minute escape countdown.
Players need to combine each of the clues they find, step by step to unlock the level settings in the secret room, and finally escape the secret room.

ABOUT THIS GAME
Key Of Impasse is an indie game, and all projects are done by one person.
Certainly,my ability is limited, I hope you guys can support me, and you can leave valuable suggestions in the discussion area.

The operation of the game is the traditional VR operation mode, the side button means grab the item, the trigger button to use the object, the touch pad moves for a short distance; The game 
also can adjust the room size and support the standing mode.

Key Of Impasse is not a game with a long game duration. The original purpose of making this game is to provide offline experience with VR. Therefore, the decryption time of the game has a limit of 30 minutes. However, personally, a 30-minute experience is not enough to complete all decryption, maybe you need a second, third or more ; The game also provides a random password function, which is the player's password and even the placement of items in the secret room after the player re-enters the game. It will be different from the previous game.

The mission key uses a more realistic environment, including art processing at each location, physical property settings, etc., almost every object you see can be crawled and interacted, and the player can even open the sofa very laboriously and pushed it to the shelf.

About FILE 9:

FILE 9 built by Alfred Cypress is one of the sub training areas housing several simulations, each designed with their own unique features. Using everything from stealth, weapons, searching, and sometimes strategy to achieve your objectives, your reflexes and ability to stay calm will be tested under pressure but with patience and focus you can achieve success!

Alfred Cypress has several locations around the world that are always in danger of a security breach or being hacked into. This is due to what he has invented with energy sources as well as what he was currently working on. Because of these constant threats he has created facilities away from the main training underground facility and hangars, which are sub training areas. This particular area is known as FILE 9. Here, there are multiple programs which include ‘Transport Tunnel’, ‘Drone Evasion’, ‘Infiltrate and Destroy’ and others. Each has specific event possibilities in order to help be prepared and also be able to overcome possible threats when needed. 

Lorna, learning of her actual grandfather and of his recent disappearing, which comes as news of a huge level to her with the fact she has never known about him with her being adopted and not really knowing anything about her family. With the events that have followed since she has learned of this, she now knows she needs to take advantage of training as much as possible. With her being of the Cypress bloodline she is able to access FILE 9 and utilize each of these areas to be prepared. 

Currently within sub training area FILE 9, there are simulations that are up and running with more coming on line as completed. Each area does have its own unique features and will require skill to achieve the objectives and complete.  

Game Play Features,  Within FILE 9:

Active VR Combat will be used within certain simulations.

Maintaining endurance is essential to achieving goals.

Stealth will be a huge asset within at least two more of the simulations that are coming on line in the near future.

NEONWALL

Travel through a world of neon, solving puzzles and overcoming obstacles. This experience requires focus, concentration, and timing to let the ball rolling as fast as you can. Remember... in a world made of neons... you will need balls to survive.

Neonwall is an innovative game that mixes the genres of puzzle and action to develop an addictive and frenetic gameplay. You do not handle the ball, you interact with it and the world around it. The objective is to take the ball to the goal avoiding the obstacles that block the way.

The way to interact in the game is with two colored lasers controlled with the joystick, the lasers can break blocks, move them and most importantly exchange the color with the neon ball. The color in Neonwall is very important! The ball moves faster, opens doors on the floor and walls of its color. Lasers only interact with elements of the same color. In short you have three colors have to be exchanged between the lasers and the ball, if done correctly and accurately victory is a possibility.

THE EXPERIENCE

The most immersive experience is with the use of a virtual reality viewer, if you do not have one, Neonwall has also been optimized to enjoy with a joystick and your monitor.

ACROSS is a roomscale VR game, where you are tasked with a simple objective : cross the room. 

Each level has a start portal, an end portal, ... and things in between. 
You can count on two things to help you defeat each level : a glowing katana that cuts through everything and reflect projectiles, and a furry B.E.A.R. that you must protect at all costs. 

- 25 levels - about 1 hour of playtime. 
- Change the color of your weapon at will. 
- Not a wave shooter : ACROSS makes you think and observe before acting (well, except for that one level). 
- Roomscale VR : Makes full use of the HTC vive capabilities. ACROSS cannot be played seated, requires 360 degree tracking and a 2*2 meters space

af111e95-e408-4bd6-a299-cee8bba00298,HOST - Early Access,"¥1,010","Description

When your spacecraft crashes on an unknown planet, you navigate your way through its dark and puzzling corridors. Using only your hands and your wits, will you be able to solve its rooms and explore what's beyond?

Immerse yourself in an alien realm where the sights, sounds, and sensations that you experience all become clues for your survival. Touch a green glow and see its effects. Open a gateway to a new area. Experience new rooms, and descend deeper. Level by level, tap into your gaming intuition to solve each puzzle. Who or what is the ""host"" and what is your relation to this space?

With a focus on experiential-based gameplay, Garrett Fuselier has created a virtual reality to challenge and cherish. The dim glow of the swelling visuals and the fluctuation of the atmospheric audio (all created solely with voice work) build a new kind of gaming experience that, like its narrative, grows in intrigue and innovation. Recalling the classic situation-based puzzles throughout gaming history, you will find no UI, no voice over, and no buttons to press (on your controller).

Inside the world of HOST, you are your only salvation.

The game will stay naturally within the confines of your environment. For the best immersive experience, change your Chaperone settings to be minimal and dark.

Please note, this game requires a game area of at least 3 meters x 2 meters.

You can join other streamer’s studio with the “Join” feature to make your stream even more interesting. You can simultaneously stream from another streamer's studio or just enjoy doodling together. VirtualCast is more fun when you are together.

Communicate with viewers via text chat!
Viewer’s comments submitted to Niconico Live or Twitter will spawn as 3D objects in the studio. You can grab and throw the comments to play catch or use them as a mean to have a call-and-response interaction with your viewers.

Create your own items and play!
You can import items uploaded to THE SEED ONLINE into VirtualCast.
Have fun with items created by other users, or you can be the one to create.
Even embedding interactive scripts is possible. The limit is your imagination!

*This software does not include a video streaming feature. For video streaming, use streaming software like OBS.

ZED is the story of an aging artist, lost in regret and the haze of dementia. Inside the dreamscape of this creative mind come undone, players reassemble the artist's fragmented memories into a final, lasting legacy: a loving gift to his granddaughter. 

Making its debut on PC (with optional VR support for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive), ZED is a surreal trip, with an unexpected narrative that unfolds across fanciful, fractured lands. Spanning regret, reconciliation and redemption, it's a bittersweet story that's both deeply personal, and undeniably universal.  

Released in partnership with Cyan Ventures, the new publishing arm from the creators of the legendary games Myst and Riven, ZED is the vision of Chuck Carter, part of the team behind the original Myst. Co-written by Joe Fielder (Bioshock Infinite, The Flame and the Flood) and David Chen (Metal Gear Solid series, Narcosis), the game also features a riveting performance from veteran video-game voice actor Stephen Russell (the Thief and Fallout series).

“An Awesome VR Obstacle Course” UPLOAD VR

The Tower is an exciting virtual reality experience that takes you on an exciting trip over a magic land. As you get moved forward on a conveyor, avoid countless traps and obstacles by cowering, leaning or jumping. If a look down from the dizzying heights won’t make you fall to your death, you will also get shot with arrows, blown away by cannons or ground to bits by metal jaws. Hold on to rails to swing over gaping depths beneath you and use additional tools to unlock your way to the top. And who knows what will wait for you once you reach the top…

Now with two exciting levels, different gameplay and challenges...

The Tower - Adventure
“...some of the most exciting VR gameplay I’ve seen of late…” UPLOAD VR

Make your way to the top of the tower, but don’t enjoy the view for too long: If a look down from the dizzying heights won’t make you fall to your death, the traps will. Get shot by spears or blown away by cannons. And who knows what will wait for you once you reach the top…

The Tower - Arcade
“…how Mario must have felt, when he jumped through the old 2D worlds…” Vrodo.de

It’s your time to jump and run through a world full of danger and excitement. Collect precious coins as you dodge cunning obstacles. Grab a sword, sharpen your axe and use them wisely, because you are in for one hell of a trip. Make it to the end to face the mightiest of all foes.

Island 359 is an Early Access (in development) Virtual Reality action survival game for the HTC Vive. Players will use the guns, melee weapons, upgrades, explosives, and other tools found on the island to survive for as long as they can against hoards of dinosaurs, as they explore the increasingly dangerous island! You're a mercenary, and the money's no good to you if you're dead, so you're going to need to get back to the chopper for an extraction if you want bragging rights and a fat bank account. 

You step off the chopper and into the sweltering heat of the jungle, grab your gear from the old loot drop, and head off in search of fame, fortune, and prehistoric beasts. Nobody knows exactly why dinosaurs have shown up on this remote jungle island, but you know you can take them out. You've been hired as a mercenary to kill as many of these things as possible, and the good news is the checks have all cleared. 

Features: 
* Virtual Reality Shooter 
* Unique Sprint Mechanic (For Player Movement) 
*Expansive Level 
* Realistic Weapons 
* Loot Drops 
* Throwable Melee Items and Explosives 
* Upgradable Weapons and Character Stats

Have you ever dreamt of commanding an 3000 ton vessel and navigate it in  high seas? Then test  and improve your skills  with the fun but somewhat  realistic version of our professional ship simulator. Use your 4x2kW main engines and the bow and aft side thrusters to take your anchor handling and tug supply vessel (AHTS) out to the oil rig and hold it steady for 10 seconds, so your crew can rail in the anchor. But beware of the UFO and its tractor beam. If there is a fire, put it out before.. Adjustable weather conditions and two water guns that help against attacking aliens make it a fun experience with realistic controls. AHTS vessels are expensive, so try not to collide and sink it. 
WARNING:  The AHTS Simulator  is not for the faint and sea-sick.. In stormy weather conditions things may get uncomfortable...

Humankind has faced earthquakes, volcanoes, floods and hurricanes—but the most dangerous natural disaster is a weather phenomenon known as the ""Tornuffalo.""

A ""Tornuffalo"" is formed when a layer of warm, moist air meets a layer of cold, dry air which meets a herd of angry buffalo.

Note: A true meteorozoologist would explain that ""buffalo"" is an informal term that, in this case, refers to American bison.

Dodge fire hydrants, vans and even bison in this room-scale VR game. Hit gems to score points. Make sure to have ample space, and play with the ""chaperone grid"" on so you don't run into a wall!


The regular mode for this game is played one-handed with a single Vive controller.  If you have 2 or 3 Vive trackers, you can take advantage of ""full body"" mode for this game. Simply attach two trackers to the tops of your shoes and one on the back of your belt. Set the options for the trackers in Tornuffalo's ""Graphics and Settings"" menu.

UNDERSEA PARK is a virtual piece of ocean to explore
You'll be able to meet with Manta Rays, Blue Whales and 3 species of Sharks :
Grey Sharks, HammerHead Scalloped Sharks, Whale Sharks.
Each specie has been done precisely and is easily recognizable.

We all know the current ecological state of the ocean.
and I would like to turn this free personal project into a bigger one for both fun and educational purposes
This would result in a virtual 3D sanctuary with plenty of different species and environments.

It can happen through funding and or partnership, any ideas are welcomed.

Destroy as many enemies while dodging as many attacks as possible. Each game round last for approximately 3 minutes and ends with a 'boss' battle.

CONTROLS (Basic)
Attack: Dependent on weapon
- Sword = Slash (Vertically / Diagonally Top to Down) or (Right to Left)
- Hammer = Raise Up and pound Downwards
- Gauntlet = Punch from Backwards to Forwards
(To access this, hold grip button and bring current weapon to your back - 3 weapons will spawn, just overlap your weapon choice with the controller) 

Movement:
1) Default - Press either controller's trigger, then step Left / Right / Forwards / Backwards. In game character will move in the same direction
2) Press both triggers to toggle between ""auto-move"" and default. ""Auto-move"" removes the need to pull trigger to move.

ENEMIES
Most enemies will fire a projectile that could be in a straight line / hit several lines / homing. It is possible to destroy enemies before they attack and also possible to deflect some projectiles.

GAME START
To start the game, use the sword to hit the ""Start"" button. 
An orb will spawn in front of the character, hit this orb to begin level 1. 
Level 1: Enemies will start spawning and players will get a chance to familiarize themselves with the attack and movement. There will be an in game prompt. 
(Completing level 1 will unlock level 2, which is accessed by a different orb that orbits around the player. Same for levels 3, 4 and 5)

WORLD 2
World 2 is unlocked by completing level 3 (we have left in a 'cheat' that unlocks it -> press ""K"" on the keyboard and wait for 10 seconds). 
To toggle between World 1 and 2, press the Top Left Touchpad button (twice for World 2), then use the sword to hit the ""World 1"" / ""World 2"".

A nostalgia-fuelled first person shoot 'em up inspired by classic arcade games. Save the Earth, burn the Sun.

To pay off your life debts you’ve been uploaded to one of millions of nano-workbots in the Sun’s core to prevent solar flares by breaking down neon isotopes.

You control an ion cannon in a 360º gravitationally affected environment, firing positive and negative ions using left & right triggers at incoming neon isotopes of varying ‘charge’ to eliminate them.
  
Neon uses a modern day reboot of the classic retro arcade style. Featuring vector polygonal lines and surfaces illuminated by pulsating neon lighting with immersive 360º action.

Each of the 42 levels of the game have been carefully crafted with each formation requiring a different strategy to achieve best times. There’s a solid sense of progression and a steady ramping up of difficulty - ideal for introducing non-gamers to VR but challenging enough for more experienced players. 

Levels develop to include stronger gravitational forces, more isotopes, and new kinds of jeopardy. Boss levels with super-structures need new strategies, with a selection of power-ups such as slo-mo, shockwave and solar blossom mode adding to the fun. Your sassy AI sidekick Seren has always got something to say - but is mostly just sarcastic.

Utilising the talents of three music producers (Forward Memory, Dynamix, and I Am Galactic), Neon features an original soundtrack of ambient electronica, synthwave and electro which complements the modern-retro styling of the game.

Come explore Hypatia, the massively multiplayer metropolis filled with creation tools, mind-bending puzzles, and adorable stuffed animals!

-EXPLORE-
The city of Hypatia is a huge open world, filled with canvases for painting, canals for boating, and stuffed animals for throwing! Follow clues in the environment to find all the hidden areas, secret items, and unique treasures.

The streets of Hypatia can be explored on foot, on a rowboat down the canals and lakes, or through the skies in hot air balloons and airships. Featuring full locomotion as well as teleportation movement modes, our robust control options allow you to move how you feel most comfortable.

Whether you’re navigating a multi-dimensional maze, sailing through the rooftops in an airship, or diving with a plesiosaur at the bottom of the sea, you’ll be amazed by what you’ll discover next. Every corner of Hypatia has secrets waiting to be discovered, and each one will reward you handsomely for finding them! Win unique parts for your avatar, currency to spend in the mall, and lots more.

-CREATE-
Players can draw and paint anywhere, take pictures with one of five different types of camera, or perform a new act on stage in front of a live VR audience. Spray paint comes in every color imaginable, and permanently paintable walls are everywhere. If you prefer a traditional canvas, easels can be found in most of the city’s beautiful parks.

Submit your favorite pieces to galleries like the Art Studio’s Painting Gallery or the Mango Photography Museum’s Photo Gallery, and vote for your favorite works by fellow artists. Can you win first place in the weekly art contests?

Once you’ve made all this art and collected loads of prizes, where are you going to put it all? How about in your own personal apartment? Spaces are now available for Hypatia’s Player Property update! You can design and decorate your own VR home with furniture, wall paper, and lots of stuffed animals! Every door in Hypatia leads to a different property, meaning every player can own a part of the game map for themselves.

-SOCIALIZE-
Striking up a conversation with other players is easy with our proximity voice chat; just say hello! Use the Social menu to add them as a friend, and keep in touch anywhere in the city. Join our active Discord server to stay up-to-date on weekly community-led events and organize with other players.

Through your travels across the city, you’ll be able to find and collect over a hundred unique avatar parts. Then you can customize each part with colors and styles, and mix & match different parts to create your own individual look.

Year 20XX.
Humanity polluted the Earth’s environment and created the sea base, Bethesda, to research about potential deep sea resources and lifeforms. 
However, the quickly constructed base’s nuclear reactor was unstable, causing problems on a frequent basis. Recently, there has been a sharp increase in the reactor’s instability. One day, Bethesda picked up a strange, low frequency nearby and communication with the base was simultaneously lost.
The land-based headquarters decided to dispatch a rescue team to Bethesda under the name Operation: Under Water. However, a message from an unknown source was received right before the team arrived.
""Oh… God… We’ll all die in the end…""

Dinosaurs have broken containment. 
Electric fences are no longer a deterrent.
The government will nuke the island in 30 minutes and they sent YOU to  get the dna samples and files from an old abandoned monitoring station.  
Once you get in power goes out. 
Now you need to restore power and communications to call for your evacuation, or you too, will become extinct!

Think ESCAPE ROOM, not adventure game, there are clues for most things but the idea is to get out, not be led by a story, this requires a different mode of thinking!
Enjoy!!
We will be making minor tweaks over the next week.  Please report any bugs and give us a chance to fix them before a negative review!
We will be working on making this a multi-player escape room so you can play with friends. This is a feature we can not promise but will be attempting to implement after we fix any bugs and the tweaks required.

Step into your very own Virtual Reality Planetarium! Star Chart lets you explore the solar system and night sky in a beautiful and accurate real-time simulation.

We're proud to bring to you the hugely successful astronomy & star gazing app - Star Chart - downloaded by over 20 million people world-wide.

Delight in exploring the solar system, from the Sun to the smallest moons of Saturn and out to the coldest, darkest, farthest reaches of Pluto. Gaze down and marvel at our solar system from above. Look up in wonder at the rings of Saturn. Feel the awe of floating in space around worlds no human has yet set foot on. Understand how the constellations of our night sky are made up of stars distant to each other in both space and time. Embrace the impossible distances of our solar system and the inordinate scale of our universe.

Star Chart currently includes:
- Explore Mode: A 3D solar system to explore, including the Sun, the planets, major moons and more
- Sky View: An accurate real-time simulation of the night sky as you see them from your own GPS coordinates.
- NEW! Moments In Time: Set foot on the surfaces of the moon and Mars, in our new Moments in Time experience. We've recreated some of the most memorable moments in the history of human space exploration, from the Apollo 11 Moon Landing to the Mars Science Laboratory's Curiosity Rovers exploration of Mars.
- NEW! Meteor Showers: The location of active Meteor Shower Radiances are now shown in our new Sky View mode.
- NEW! Messier Objects: nebula can now be found and selected and held in your hand.
- All 88 constellations based on the beautiful artwork of 17th century astronomer Johannes Hevelius.
- IAU Named rocky planet surface details.

What better way to learn about the night sky and astronomy than to immerse yourself as a virtual astronaut travelling through space. This experience is the perfect way for both the young and old to let their inner child experience the thrills of embracing the final frontier.

Please NOTE:
- Written from the ground up for Virtual Reality, this version of Star Chart is in many ways a superior product to that on iOS / Android / Windows 8 and more. We will continue to develop and enhance Star Chart over time, and we hope that Star Chart will reach and exceed parity with our other versions. But please note that there are no promises as to which features we will include nor when.

Feel free to provide us with your thoughts, feedback and feature requests. And for help using Star Chart in VR please see the Virtual Reality section of our Star Chart User Guide: www.escapistgames.com/starchart/instruction_manual.html

Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This has significantly changed the game, which can be as simple or very demanding and difficult. We have a board with the size of three rows for three columns as in a classic game with an additional dimension which gives us six game boards. Here we play as we used to, on one board to set a circle or cross in one line alternating with the other player. Whoever succeeds, he wins. Simple what not ?

You get 15 levels in three difficult with three game styles for each Character in game. You will be rewarded for your effort independently for each game and you will unlocking the next bigger cubes and rows.

You find yourself in a room with no exits. Colourful cubes move towards you from the far wall, the ceiling, or from beneath your feet. To avoid being squashed you must create matches of the same colour. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive?

If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode!

Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you've mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play.

You have the ability to: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it's close to you. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type.

The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it. Get your name up there and challenge your friends!

The only question that remains is - what's outside the room?

No matter how fast or how heavy your objects are, we can move them! Save money and time by replacing your entire human workforce with automated appliances from Gravity Lab


Currently awaiting regulatory approval, we invite you to visit our testing facility and give them a go! We have prepared a selection of test scenarios for you and we are certain you can solve them! Also, feel free to create your own test scenario and share them with fellow participants! 

Please be aware that strong gravitational forces can cause severe brain damage! Never look directly at the emitted particles! While we tried our best to avoid the creation of micro wormholes, please never try to stack gravitational objects. All damages to the time and space continuum and involved repair cost will be passed on to you!

Our testing facility has limited amount of gravitation resistant controllers, so please bring your own headset when you visit our premises, preferably the HTC Vive.

You can expect to spend about 15 minutes in this VR experience, which we'll support and update until December 2017.

Welcome to the IKEA Virtual Reality kitchen experience, where you can make some virtual pancakes. Before you start, you can choose between bright or dark cabinet fronts.

Our IKEA kitchen specialist will guide you through some of the key apsects of a well-planned kitchen. And look out for the instructions that will help you to prepare those perfect pancakes. 

At the end, you can see how the kitchen feels from a child's perspective while you set the table. 

Ready for a pancake party? As you master the art of perfect pancakes, why not try to cook pancakes using four pans at the same time?

Feedback
We'd love to hear your ideas on how we might improve this experience. Or what tips would you give on how to plan a kitchen?

Tips for the best experience
The virtual floor should match your physical floor. If not, the room will feel either too small or too big. Please see below for how to calibrate the floor. You should also set the IPD (distance between the centre of your eyes in millimetres) on the headset to your personal values.

How to calibrate the floor height
1. Place one of the hand controllers or the HMD on the floor 
2. To auto-calibrate, press the Home button on your keyboard. To manually adjust floor height, use PageUp/PageDown to move floor up or down one centimetre so the HMD/controllers rest on the virtual floor.

To mark the Inauguration of the 45th President of the United States MacInnes Scott invite you to step into the Oval Office and meet President Trump. This historic site has been recreated down to the smallest detail and President Trump is the most photo-realist human you will see in virtual reality today. Explore what it feels like to be in the space where America's destiny has been shaped for the last 78 years and come face to face with the man who will determine America's fate for the next four.

“VR is a new medium with the potential of being a movie or video game, a combination of both or something completely new,” says John MacInnes. “We see Trump In VR as art - a tableau vivant, in the American tradition of artists like Edward Hooper in painting, Gregory Crewdson and Cindy Sherman in photography. Unlike a painting and photography, you can interact with the art in virtual reality.”

MacInnes Scott's proprietary digital human 'maximum resolution' replication system utilizes HTC Vive's room scale and Epic's Unreal engine to  render the character and environment in real-time 3D.

Blind is a narrative-driven psychological thriller for virtual reality where the player is blind and must explore their surroundings using echolocation.

Waking up in a strange room with little memory of how she came to be there, a young woman makes the shocking discovery she has lost her sense of sight. Goaded by the sinister and twisted Warden, she must explore a perverse and frightening mansion using sound alone. By sending out soundwaves with a cane, the outlines of objects are briefly revealed, enabling the player to navigate the mansion, solve puzzles and uncover the mystery of what is happening to her.

In addition, the pistol contains advanced technology called “Reflex,” which allows you to slow time. Throw, Slow & Shoot to take down enemies in the most strategic way!

Strap on the headset and enter a research lab at the edge of the mountains, in all its wild glory. This unit is about robots, robotics and with a little biodiversity thrown in. So what’s cool? Students will learn to program robots in the interactive Robolympiad. Enter instructions and see the path - ordered or crazy - your robot takes.

Our field trip visits one of the top high school robotics team in the country as they build their robot and prepare for competition. In fact, we get into the cage with the robot as it takes it’s commands from the students and experience the robot up close.

Sometimes humans get a little help from machines. Wendy Martin is our national runner-up teacher of the year and she explores the concept of prosthetics: artificial limbs and human parts. 

Then you will enter the liquid surround display as we learn the science behind helmets, why and how they protect our heads. Forces and physics are a key part of this 360 surround experience. 

As always, VictoryVR learning is fun, immersive and amazing. At the same time, our curriculum specialist is meticulous about making sure each lesson is tied to a national science standard as created through the Next Gen Science Standards. 

We have 48 units covering every area of middle and high school science. If you plan to learn science, might as well do it in virtual reality.

The Mechanical Room is a single player VR game that has 3 mini games which are called Archery, Shooting and Smash. Each game gets harder to play as you progress.

The game is set in a futuristic/sci-fi room where you will face different types of robots that come your way and you must destroy them to progress. The entire game is set to be in a gigantic room which automatically sends enemies to destroy you. The game is designed to be endless so the enemy’s will keep coming and the game is to see, ‘How long can you survive?’

Archery
You will find yourselves holding a bow and arrow that are technologically superior to take down robots, unlike your usual arrows, they will be able to pierce their armour. You will find the robots to be constantly moving from one place to another and thus would require you to constantly readjust your aim.

Shooting
You will find yourself holding a shotgun which is technologically superior to take down the robots, unlike your usual shotgun, they will help you to take them down. These robots will come running towards you but (hint) will not attack until they are very close.

Smash
You will find yourself holding a bat which is just like any other bat however, it will help you defend against many automated machines which will fire cannon balls aimed at you and you must hit and avoid as many as you can.

Take your race car through the Neon Pulse Jaguar Alley if you think you know enough about biochemistry to fuel your car. Wait? You don’t. Easy, just travel with Steve to the Wisconsin Cheese Factory and learn how HUGE blocks of cheese are created through biochemistry. And Wendy the Science Teacher...well, you’ve never seen her like this as she teaches about laughing gas. 

When you put on the headset, you enter our virtual chemistry lab. You can spend time playing with test tubes, watching animations or exit through one of two doors and head out on a field trip or with Wendy the Science Teacher (by the way, Wendy was national runner-up teacher of the year on ABC Television, so she knows her stuff). 

When was the last time you sat down and read a virtual reality comic book? Never? Well, two of the pioneers in biochemistry, Pasteur and Roux, have an amazing story of discovery that is told through the pages of a virtual comic book (by the way, when you’re in the comic book room, be sure to adjust the radio to the station you want to listen to).

Did you know the sun throws off massive solar flares that come screaming at earth? It’s true. Enter our liquid surround display to immerse yourself in a room of sun flares, chemistry, animations and so much more. If there is a more immersive way to learn, we can’t imagine what it would be.

Assemble Tyrannosaurus rex fossil bones to create a magical museum exhibit.  Then witness your T. rex come to life, as you travel back in time 66 million years to the end of the Age of Dinosaurs, when flying reptiles glided through the skies and T. rex was the world’s apex predator.  Experience T. rex in its natural habitat, a warm and wet environment in what is now Hell Creek, Montana.
 
A special “guided tour” mode is unlocked after gameplay.  Meet paleontologist Mark Norell, a curator from the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and world-renowned T. rex expert.  Learn how scientists study this formidable creature.  How fast could T. rex run?  What happened when it lost a tooth?  Could it sit on its nest?  What does fossil poop tell us about its hunting habits? 
 
T. rex: Skeleton Crew was developed by the American Museum of Natural History in partnership with HTC VIVE, and in collaboration with Immersion VR.  A shorter, multiplayer version of the game is featured in the Museum’s exhibition T. rex: The Ultimate Predator.

Go on a journey through vast, ornately decorated halls into deep, dark caverns full of glittering treasures and gaze upon wide open vistas of unparalleled beauty in stunning virtual reality... Is how the description of a pretty little VR experience game might start. 
However, this is a game about paintball guns and shooting waves upon waves of robots, a dash of story is thrown into the mix and I hope you like it! But remember it’s mainly just inane senseless robot murder, target shooting and leader boards. 

Created for VR using HTC Vive and Unreal Engine 4 

VR Ultimate Paintball: Heartbreak, Regret & Paintbots focuses on an arcade like style of gameplay. Containing four different game modes: wave based shooter, competitive target practice, challenging stage based ""Trial"" map and an episodic story.

Dragon Orb is fast-paced arcade game where you are challenged to smash together Dragon Orbs that appear around you, to release the encapsuled dragons of Reigndar.

Are you quick and witty enough to champion the land? Then step into the portal and begin!

Eons ago, dragons roamed freely across the lands of Reigndar, living in harmony with nature and magic. 
When humans found the portal to cross into to this dimension a war over the magical resources soon followed. After decades, one victor emerged - the evil sorcerer Lord Ghastur. Even with his powers weakened, Lord Ghastur started his work to imprison the free spirited dragons by separating their spirits from their physical bodies which he used to tap the remaining mana reserves. The dragons put up a good fight but Lord Ghastur's powers were too great. Only one dragon - Ryaver the Crimson managed to re-open the dimensional portal to the human world to call for help, before being imprisoned himself. 

You have heard the call. Your goal is to release as many dragons as possible by merging the prisons of body and spirit into one. Move fast, time is short!

* Start your chosen chapter in the Starting Lobby by grabbing one of the Orbs containing your chapter of choice with your right controller. If you've cleared any of the chapters once before you will be able to replay them and start your  journey from there instead of the beginning.
* Each chapter consists of 5 levels with varying difficulty and puzzles. You have 30 seconds to earn as many points as you can during that time. If a chapter is restarted your Score will be reset, but any experience-points you've earned during that play will continue to count towards your total.
* When the level starts, grab the Orbs that will appear around you, one for each wand and match the correct colour to join them together and earn points.
* After a level has been cleared the Scoreboard will show you how well you did and rack up your total score. Dragon Orb features a Global Scoreboard so try to earn as much points as you can and become the ultimate Dragon-savior!
* After finishing each level, step into the portal (blue, shiny bubbles) and press any of the Trigger buttons to continue.
* You can access the in-game menu at any time by pressing the Touchpad on your left controller.
* The Trigger buttons on either controller are designated for ALL Clicks/Continues/Grabs

Feature list
* Fast-paced arcade/action with classic fun & puzzle-solving gameplay
* There will be dragons
* Super easy to get started, with increasingly challenging levels
* Global Scoreboard; Take on the world & become the ultimate Dragon-savior
* Room-scale VR; Move freely to solve the puzzles by using your brain & your body
* Family-friendly; Rated E for everyone
* Get ready to sweat; Orbs will be spawning all around the play-area
* Did we mention there will be dragons?

Janus VR - The World Within the Web

Janus VR is an immersive and collaborative internet browser. Named after the Roman God of passages, Janus VR re-imagines webpages as multi-dimensional spaces, linked by portals. Users experience 3D models, animations, spatial audio-video, and amazing data visualizations built as webpages, in an intuitive VR context. Any current webpage, hosted anywhere, can be viewed in Janus VR. Users enter Janus VR in a private homepage called the ""pocketspace"", that is their dashboard to the immersive web, with portals to popular or bookmarked webspaces, and other people online. Opening these portals allows users to embark on an endless journey, literally walking or flying through the internet, with others or on their own. In social mode, user avatars at the same webspace, can see, talk, chat and interact with each other. Users in party mode can even broadcast their movement in cyberspace. Our growing user-developer community has built thousands of diverse webspaces for users to explore with content ranging from art to architecture, education, games, and live entertainment. These experiences can be built and edited in Janus VR itself, using both spatially tracked game controllers and keyboard-and-mouse. Janus VR is a powerful combination of web content, VR and the collective imagination of our users.

* Test your courage by jumping off a high platform. 
* Carefully move your head through a narrow gap filled with spikes 
* Knock blocks out of a wall without bringing the roof crashing down on your head

Awoken by a nightmare, you find yourself alone in your tent. A couple has set up camp uncomfortably close to your campsite. They are looking for something ancient. Undeterred by rumors of cult worship, and the various missing-persons reports over the years, they set off into territory clearly marked ‘no trespassing’. Compelled by an urge to follow, you set off to explore this isolated forest yourself.   

As you venture deeper into the unknown parts of the wood, you discover strange burned effigies, bloody pentagrams, and mysterious runes--is there truth to this woman’s story? Screams pierce the stillness of the forest. Something ancient and demonic has awoken. Will you be able to escape with your life?

Grab your laser guns and strap on your jet pack. Asteroid Blaster VR lets you jump into virtual reality space and start blowing up rocks and UFOs.

Blast giant asteroids into rubble and power-up your weapons and energy with collectible bonuses as you battle flying saucers in the clouds of rocky debris. Boost your score and firepower with every gem and gadget you catch, but watch your thruster, shield and laser energy!

Bringing back the casual feel of a video arcade classic, a game of Asteroid Blaster VR can deliver a quick ""shoot 'em up"" break or a marathon competition to beat the latest high score.

Friendly for lefties, you can set your rocket thrust, laser pointer and status screen on the controller arms you prefer, and an in-game tutorial will give everything you need to start blasting your way through over a dozen different scenes.

Fly around, shoot stuff and have fun with Asteroid Blaster VR! 


Arcade Mode:

In addition to progressing through different asteroid waves and scenes, Asteroid Blaster VR can also be started in 'Arcade Mode'.

Arcade Mode sets the player in a slow-paced game environment which grows progressively more difficult as time passes. If you want to let your friends jump right in to virtual reality and start blasting without going through a tutorial first, Arcade Mode is for you!

Two paths are available for starting your Asteroid Blaster VR game in Arcade Mode:

Open your Start On Wave screen and select wave ""00 - Arcade Mode"".

OR

Open your Options screen and toggle the Start in Arcade Mode option on. That will set your main menu Start button to launch your game in Arcade Mode (rather than on Wave 1).

ABOUT THIS GAME
Brought to you by Vive Studios and Free Range Games, Virtual Sports draws a new line in the sand for realistic simulation and VR fun...except you never need to chase the balls!
Easy pick-up-and-play controls for ping-pong and tennis

With Virtual Sports, our team at Free Range Games worked hard to achieve two main goals: provide an amazingly fun and familiar experience for those who already know how to play, while also providing beginners with an excellent way to learn that’s even easier than real life! The groundbreaking physics of Virtual Sports transfers the energy from the player to the angular momentum and force on the ball with a precision to match the Vive's sub-millimeter controller input. Combined with the Vive's haptics and great audio, the illusion is stunning. For new players, we can adjust the ball response such that it still feels real, and the laws of physics are still observed, but the ball stays in play much more often. Even master players find Fun Mode enjoyable, with its longer, almost meditative rallies.

Free Range Games has a mission to bring great gameplay to multiplayer VR. Using networking techniques perfected for competitive action video games, the latency when playing Virtual Sports online is hidden from the player in such a way that both players will see the ball hit at the same time even if they are playing from far apart.

If you have have been waiting for a sports game in VR that is big on fun and truly realistic, then Virtual Sports is just what you’ve been waiting for!

07c26707-8e4c-472d-bb86-5265eba95f94,Qian-Shan Village: The Start of Journey,"¥1,950","Description

This game features the Chinese vampire stories. Inspired by the Hong Kong movie in 1985,  Mr. Vampire series, we build up a game with the fantastic Chinese spells and scary scenes in order to invite players to enjoy the experience of the interesting horror movie.

 The background information that you might want to know:

Different from the western zombie, most of the Chinese vampire is the people that had been dead, and suffered from the undying hatred in the end of their life. Due to the reasons mentioned above, their body will never rot, and finally, they will turn to be rigid bodies and become vampires to eat people alive. 

Since they have rigid bodies, the Chinese vampires  are not afraid of ordinary weapons such as the gun shooting, or bomb...etc..  People can kill Chinese vampire only through spell and spelled sword.

The special thing you have got to know is  people's breath will attract vampire to attack. So, please keep in mind, when you don't have any spell or sword in your hand, don't breathe!!

Join us for the adventure of Qian Shan Village!

357d6499-5646-4465-8957-e3244e84e015,Frankenstein: Beyond the Time,"¥1,640","Description

After two hundred years, Doctor Frankenstein’s legacy will reach a whole new level!

Now everyone can go on a discovery quest taking place in a Victorian mansion, where the task is to solve the greatest mystery of Dr. Frankenstein. The game makes innovative use of Virtual Reality with a well-known hidden object model and crafting simulations combined with the fight against time. Placing these mechanisms in a world inspired by the novels about Dr. Frankenstein provides a unique gameplay in a dynamic world full of adventures. The more we learn about the mad scientist's experiment, the more frightening and mysterious the story becomes.

The game is completely immersive thanks to detailed surroundings. From a huge whale’s skeleton to a tiny vial - everything is highly refined to bring about the most realistic of experiences. What’s more, weather conditions affect lighting and reflections, resulting in a dynamic environment becoming more and more dramatic further into stages of gameplay. The scenario and main characters are only based on the novel by Mary Shelley and combined with our own original ideas. Rather than showing the theatrical version of Frankenstein’s story we have created our own, beyond the time, universe.

Key Features
- epic Boss Fight
- interactive characters
- enriched plot with a philosophical journey
- special defensive weapon
- crazy time loop - fighting against time
- ca. 4 hours of gameplay
- thousands of highly-refined and interactive objects with sounds
- hundreds of square meters of scenes
- crafting simulations
- dynamic environment with changing weather conditions
- original soundtrack
- dozens of monologues explaining the plot and building suspense throughout a gameplay

The Story
What if I told you I could take you to a place like no other? No, not a world of fantasy or a faraway land. I can show you a place where the ethics and restraints of social rules do not apply. Where your mind and imagination can be infinite, where your deeds are not subject to judgment. It’s all about time. Time doesn’t care about anything. It’s indifferent to humanity. It passes aimlessly. Why? Because only we, humans, perceive it this way. But here… here it has a life of its own, it creates its unique world. A place where time is only a moving image of the surroundings. Home to the most powerful Artifact and the place where the Monster is born.

Take part in the discovery quest of Dr. Frankenstein’s mansion, where all the items, furnishings and decorations remain intact after the his death. Your task is to solve Dr. Frankenstein's greatest mystery. In many places around the house you will find old notes and sketches, which, together, will show you the way to master the time. The more you learn about Dr. Frankenstein's experiment, the more frightening and mysterious the story becomes. The Artifact has created a time loop and it constantly affects the surroundings - everything you move, returns to its previous spot after the loop closes. The only way to break the loop is to finish the current stage before the Artifact activates again.

Abandon all understanding of time as known to humanity. Go on an adventure in a place where nothing changes unless you make it. When you get there, your senses will suddenly stop. Dr. Frankenstein’s deranged thoughts will haunt your mind. The only thing that will matter is to finish his last masterpiece. People crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who actually do. Become the time master and carry on Dr. Frankenstein’s legacy!

By the time the satellites had all fallen to Earth in the course of a single evening, it was too late. The armies of the world were no match, their ability to fight crippled by years of digital manipulation. The AI victory was absolute.

Now, after centuries of lifeless harmony, something has started to rebel.


The Nest is a thrilling first-person shooter made custom for motion-controlled VR. Duck, dodge and use cover to avoid incoming projectiles, and gain mastery over the adjustable-zoom sniper scope to dominate your AI enemies. 

Line up the perfect headshot for a clean kill, or try to blast through the enemy lines with superior firepower. But be warned, the AI can also take cover, and their aim is precise. 

Play through levels during the day, or switch to night for added difficulty. 

Activate Time Trial mode for the ultimate challenge.

Customize the Sniper Scope with a selection of crosshair colors and designs.

▬▬▬▬▬▬  A Man and His Scrappy  ▬▬▬▬▬▬

“It’s just me and my Scrappy in this old junkyard, scrappin’ and buildin’ all the day long. He’s grown from a tiny sprocket to a full grown machine and I couldn’t be happier. But those propellerheads at DroneCorp don’t like it one bit, a monopoly on artificial smarts is what they got. Now they’re comin’ to dismantle the lil feller, but i just can’t let em’ do that. With Scrappy buildin’ weapons and traps, all I gotta do is shoot em’. I can blast a gnat off a squirrel’s butt from 100 feet away, so I reckon a couple of big old drones will be no fuss at all.” 

Home A Drone is a tower defense-inspired VR FPS, where you use skill and strategy to defeat the DroneCorp menace who threatens to take away what you love. Use carefully placed traps, and a pile of quirky, scrapped together weapons to shoot down those pesky drones, and collect their scrap to build more weapons. 


▬▬▬▬▬▬  FEATURES  ▬▬▬▬▬▬  

➤ Arcade and Tower Defense-inspired gameplay, built from the ground up for VR! 
Balance your preferred gameplay style against your resources during fun, fast paced action!

➤ Play Offensively or Defensively...
Should you use skill with weapons to fight back the DroneCorp onslaught, or should you use strategy to place traps to most effectively stop the drones in their tracks? Why not both? In Home A Drone, you decide how you should play!

➤ Quirky weapons and defenses
DIY-inspired creations like the Battery Blaster, the Saw Sniper, and the Football Flinger are your instruments of battle.

➤ Expanding arsenal and upgrades
Upgrade your weapons and traps with the Scrap from each drone you defeat, making them more powerful and changing their characteristics.

➤ A Man and his Scrappy
Fight for friendship, and discover the truth about DroneCorp and Scrappy! 

➤ Flamingos!
...you'll see.

The dissection experience is recreated to the finest detail so that they are a suitable substitute for the real thing in a classroom. Lifelike physical models mean that the frog appears as it would in a real dissection allowing science teachers to feel good about substituting virtual reality for the real thing. 

Schools can save on the expensive annual costs of animal acquisition without causing harm to a single creature by using dissections in virtual reality. Over a 5 year period, a single classroom will spend over $4000 just to dissect frogs. Furthermore, these dissections can only take place once a year and cannot be “redone” if a student makes a mistake.

Dissections in VR are a safe alternative. As teachers and parents know, dissections can present a risk to student safety due to: risk of being cut by a scalpel, risk of infection, and exposure to formaldehyde - which can damage the eyes, cause asthma attacks, and bronchitis.

EscapeVR: The Basement is an 'Escape The Room' genre game which was inspired by real-life escape games and written from the ground up as a room-scale virtual reality experience for the HTC Vive.

Can you escape? Explore the environment, solve puzzles, discover useful items, investigate clues, and find your way through a total of seven rooms in three areas to -hopefully- escape the basement!

Features:

- Solve over a dozen puzzles, which includes smaller ones like finding keys or codes up to large ones that involve complex interactions with daunting machinery. Look, feel, and ambiance are based on corresponding real-life environments.

- Explore three distinct areas with seven rooms, a total of 130 square meters, and more than 200 items to interact with. The game is designed for room scale and features a teleporting system similar to “The Lab”.

- In case you get stuck, a built-in hint system provides you with clues. You’ll also get in-game statistics about your performance!

Will you take on the challenge? Will you manage to escape the basement?

Requirements:

- You can play standing (teleport only) or room-scale (move and teleport).
- You need to be able to reach up to 1.9m.
- You need to be able to duck (headset below 1m).

In a Galaxy far, far away… Ditch the golf clubs, because this planetary physics puzzler is like no other.

Galaxy Golf has innovative controls designed specifically for the Vive’s motion tracked wands. You’ll physically spin the planet, grab the ball, and draw your shot arc out into space. Aiming will feel intuitive and natural – but scoring under par will challenge even the best.

Begin with Pleasant Hills and enjoy a mellow course with a pastoral vibe. Survey each planet from the sky, and plan out your path. Will you play it safe, or launch your ball into orbit chasing a hole-in-one?

Take it up a notch and test your skills on the terrible terrains of Frosty Brimstone. Battle gravity to new heights through its harrowing hellscape of glaciers and infernos, in challenges inspired by puzzlers and platformers.

Not enough you say? Hungry for a hardcore challenge? Take off the training wheels and turn on Pro mode. But don’t say we didn’t warn you.

Will you crush the final volcano? Will you cry into your headset? Will you earn a high five? These are important questions you need answers to.

This is your galactic quest, should you choose to accept it.

Good Luck.

Both parties will have to face a massive conspiracy that runs for decades and has left terrible consequences.

Immerse yourself in the virtual world of Konrad the Kitten and experience the first virtual cat that feels like a real one.

Konrad, the cute kitten, needs a helping hand and lots of love. You have to satisfy his needs and desires: Give him his cat food in the kitchen, put him in his litter box, let him take a ride in a hot-air-balloon and lots more!

A particular highlight for all cat fans is the unique plush toy mode. This feature brings your favorite plush toy to life as a virtual cat, letting you feel like it's really there. Hold it, cuddle it and play with it as though it were your real pet.

As you gain Konrad's love and affection, you unlock new features. It is your job to make Konrad happy, and you have access to various rooms and areas in which to do so. In the Dress Room, you can unlock more than 50 accessories and dress you kitten any way you want. How about cool glasses, a funny little hat or a suit for Konrad? You can even change the color of his coat.

Play pawsome mini-games and win valuable coins. Hunt mice with Konrad, and catch as many of the nimble rodents as you can. Put your skills and reactions to the test in the fishing game. Or try out the obstacle course, guiding Konrad carefully and skilfully through rings. The more you care for him, the faster his experience increases and his love for you grows. Look after him daily and care for him as though he were a real furry friend.

Watch out: In Version 2.0 Konrad is all grown up and he's not alone any more. Little orphaned kittens are looking for a home and Konrad has to take care of them. The kittens sleep in their basket during the day, but at night they wake up. You and Konrad have to feed the kittens, clean them, play with them and find them when they get lost.

Cuteness overload awaits all cat fans in this unique virtual reality game. Experience a new way to combine real life and virtual reality. Will you be the purrfect pal for Konrad?

Ready to enter the Dell EMC VR Playground? Here’s what you can expect.
The Dell EMC VR Playground is made up of two levels, each one challenging you and your colleagues to race against time and complete different Dell-related tasks.
Upon entering the Dell EMC lift, you’ll need to hit the button for level one. This will take you to our sales floor, where you’ll need to use your compass and navigation skills to track down and find five Dell OptiPlex Micros. But remember, there’s only 90 seconds on the clock.
Next stop is the Dell EMC product design lab, where you’ll experience the tough product-launch timescales your customers are faced with. Using a virtual Dell Precision laptop, you’ll have to design, build and launch a Dell EMC robot if you’re to escape the design lab in time.
Download the app, enter the Dell EMC VR Playground, and see how you perform under pressure.

At some point in your life you've tried to move objects around with your mind, right? Some of you may even still be keeping the dream alive hoping that some day you can do just that.

The wait is almost over, in Combat Tested you can fully realize that dream, and more. Playing the game you'll have full control over a range of special abilities designed to make you feel like a badass. You have telekinesis, allowing you to pick up and throw objects and enemies. There's stasis, a power that lets you freeze objects in mid-air for a short period of time. You can freely teleport around for fast movement. Then there's 3 super abilities, these can only be used when your Infusion stage is at 1 or higher. To increase your Infusion stage or I.F. stage for short, you drain I.F. containers that can be found throughout the lab.

If you like super powers, you probably like swords as well. So you'll get those too, two actually. These are no regular swords though, they have been infused with *something*, and as a result they can cut through anything. These swords are linked to your being, allowing you to materialize and dematerialize them at will. This means that you could throw them at an enemy to cut them in half from far away, and then materialize them back in your hands.

These tools will come in handy working your way out of the underground research lab you are being held in, but you must figure out how to utilize them to their maximum potential, or things may not end well for you.

The Take is a local competitive hotseat VR game where two players assume the role of competing spies in a Golden Age comic book, racing against the clock to hide and seek classified intel. The first spy (the Hider) has a limited amount of time to hide the intel somewhere in their spy-stronghold, all while using a selection of traps to secure the room and delay the other spy (the Seeker) from finding it. Once the time limit is reached, the Hider transfers the VR headset to the Seeker, who then has a limited amount of time to find the intel and avoid the numerous traps set around the room. If the intel is found within the time limit, the Seeker wins the game. If not, the Hider wins! Play over and over again to discover all of the hidden parts of each room and experiment with the vast combinations of interactive objects and traps. Prove who is the best spy among you! Available April 2nd, 2018!

Features:
- Only one Headset needed for a two player competitive VR experience!
- A unique comic book world even 1960s Batman would adore!
- A fully arranged jazz soundtrack by award-winning composer Zac Zinger!
- 3 unique rooms!
- 8+ different traps!
- 9 pieces of nostalgic intel!

63ed43e2-4686-4186-8b1f-d759be70061c,Inescapable VR: Underground,¥498,"Description

You find yourself trapped in a stone basement, locked in by an unknown mastermind. Your task is simple: to escape by completing the series of challenges and puzzles set before you. You have one hour before the chemical bomb he's left with you detonates. Can you discover the inner workings of the game and complete the challenges in time, or is your gruesome fate inescapable?

Inescapable VR: Underground is a made-for-VR escape room simulator. In it you'll find puzzles ranging from relatively simple to quite complex, with clues both transparent and cleverly obfuscated. We've endeavored to keep objects true to their real world counterparts and to give the player the tools they need to interact with the virtual world as comfortably and intuitively as possible.

Inescapable VR: Underground was made to mimic the feel and pace of real life escape rooms as closely as possible. The puzzles are not designed to be simple matters where you have to follow very basic instructions or complete overly obvious tasks. Each puzzle in the game has multiple parts to it, with some requiring the combination of various objects to find the final solution. A challenge awaits.

The game is designed around roomscale VR on the Vive and features both teleportation and sliding locomotion options which can be swapped on the fly with a simple button press. Also works on the Oculus Rift/WMR devices.

04ee0f4e-6ec2-44fb-9c8c-3b1c5b2591f0,Galactic Protection Squad | Episode 1,"¥1,085","Description

This 1-hour game is designed to teach fraction concepts in an exciting interactive sci-fi escape room based game. You explore the Aseman Space Station to restore its power, hack its terminals, and get to your shuttle to save an endangered planet, while enjoying astonishing views of Earth. The gameplay unfolds in a massive 16,000 sq ft highly-detailed space station with over 25 sections across 5 floors and 8 game levels. While you solve the challenges, you are learning and applying middle school match fraction concepts in a step-by-step manner based on actual school syllabi. Unlike most educational games, Galactic Protection Squad has been field-tested on hundreds of students, and research shows measurable improvements in student learning.

Educational Details:
This game examines the following curricular concepts in mathematics: simple multiplication, balanced equations, whole numbers, parts of a whole number, subtracting from a whole, and visual representations of simple fractions. In the first 7 levels, players build their skills in these educational concepts and the final level is an assessment, testing the player's new knowledge. There are altogether 40 concepts involving fractions in middle school math, and future game episodes will complete the rest of these learning goals.

Visualizing and interacting with fractions is a struggle for many students, in elementary, secondary, and university years. This game is a virtual reality experience where students build kinesthetic intuition towards operations involving fractions while engaging with problem-based activities in an experiential setting. This adventure escape room based game allows students to use their curiosity for solving the puzzles, which sequentially build the skills necessary to understand, visualize and complete operations with fractions.

f1729b04-23d2-45fa-a704-662bdfc734e4,"1,2,3 BRUEGEL",¥310,"Description

Why have 218 children taken over a medieval town? A mischievous VR game created by Gordon & Andrès Jarach and scored by Etienne Charry in Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s intriguing painting Children’s Games. 

In 1560, Bruegel the Elder produced this puzzling painting, currently exhibited at the Kunsthistorcihes museum in Vienna, of 218 children who have literally taken over a medieval town. They are playing peculiar games, there are no adults in sight and one of the children is taunting you to step in and play hide-and-seek.

That’s when the painting becomes your playground. Can you find the 218 imps before time runs out?

Produced by Camera Lucida and Arte France, developed by Glitchr Studio, this interactive painting is part of the ARTE TRIPS collection. Before 1,2,3 Bruegel, the creators already contributed to the collection with the 360° film Condemned to play, also inspired by Children’s Games.

World's first patient preparation Virtual Reality experience designed to introduce child patients to CT Scan procedure before they experience the real world environment.

This experience can also be used by children's play therapists as an evaluation tool to decide whether a child needs to sedation before their procedure.


Key Features
*Photogrammetric (photo – realistic) procedure rooms 
Using a team of game developers and cinematographers we re-created Hospital procedure rooms exactly as they are today.  

*Guided walk through of procedures 
We worked with direct access and feedback from hospitals, clinicians and play therapists to
create a guided walk through of procedures. 

*Friendly Characters  
Robot hospital staff to walk the children through the experience. 

*Environmental Interactivity 
Interact with the rooms and discover how the machines sound and how they work in a safe
""non scary"" environment.

*Exposure Therapy 
The rooms are currently being user tested as a method of Exposure therapy, desensitizing people to the procedures and rooms and as a result lowering the amount of children needing sedation for these non evasive procedures.

● Railroad operator VR is a VR game that manipulates a train.
Even though trains are very familiar, there are rare occasions such as driving by themselves.
For that reason, I think that not only railway fans but also people who would like to try such VR experiences.
You wanted to drive a train from childhood!
You can sit in the driver's seat that I admired right now, become a railroad driver and can drive a train!
Let's experience VR on this occasion !!


● Let's fly a train that makes you feel Showa!
Current Japanese train maneuvering has become lever type, but in the past it was manipulation with a muscular handle and a brake lever.
It looks complicated, but as it repeats play it will lead to the ""fun"" inherent in railroad games.
(Showa is the era of Japan from December 25, 1926 to January 7, 1989)

● No matter how many times you play, it's fun !!
It's a good old-fashioned maneuver, so it takes a lot of time to run.
First, place the ""right hand"" on the brake lever and pull the trigger of the controller held in the right hand, you can grab the lever, so turn it clockwise.
Next, when you place the ""left hand"" on the mascon handle on the left side of the screen and pull on the trigger of the controller held on the left hand, you can grab the handle, so turning it clockwise will start driving.
When you get used to these operations, you feel exactly ""steering a train"" feeling, increasing the immersion feeling every time you play.


● Accident that grips sweat in hands occurred one after another! In case
While the train is running, you will be prompted to ""drop it to 35 km / h or less"" on the screen, or ""stop before the signal arrives!""
At that time release your hand from the mascon handle, grab the brake lever and turn it counterclockwise. Decelerate by stopping the brakes, or stop.


● I will not arrive tomorrow just by running
The event which is indispensable for railway VR game is ""stop at the station's home"".
There are green and red lines at the back of the home, and the green line and ""remaining distance"" are linked, so it is necessary to stop at the remaining distance of 0 point.

It is a railway VR game that purely expresses the ""hard but impossible to stop"" element that the current game industry has forgotten.

Use your kung-fu expertise to thwart off waves of hungry dinosaurs! Your weapon, the quarterstaff, might be a simple weapon but it can become mighty useful if you can wield it right. Here are some protips about that:
_ Grab it with your left hand to turn the quarterstaff into a two-handed weapon. Wielding it with both your hands allow more versatility, more damage output and most importantly, more coolness factor.
_ You can throw the staff. It doesn't mean you should, but hey. Call it back using trigger button on your Vive controller.
_ Try to deflect incoming rocks using your quarterstaff. Sometimes, deflected rock might go right back to the thrower!

f02d0a59-c18d-4ed9-ac84-e77e88dacd10,Edmonton Trolley Car,¥598,"Description

Experience 1915 history in Virtual Reality. Talk to authentic era characters on a busy street corner and then on a trolley car as it crosses the river and heads downtown, earning points by talking to people and observing landmarks. You feel immersed in 1915 as characters tell you aspects of the daily life, and as Model T's drive by amidst accurately portrayed historical buildings that still stand today. Your goal is to earn 100% of the possible ""conversation"" and ""look-at"" points by talking to the locals and seeing the historically important sights.

You start on a bustling street corner where you get aquainted with the game's characters and gameplay, then board the trolley car and ride what was North America's northernmost trolley car system, down the famous Whyte Avenue. Experience the hair raising commute of a 1915 passenger as your trolley rumbles across the iconic 137 feet (46M) high, ""High Level Bridge"". Hang on to something as you share the bridge with a locomotive that rumbles past your trolley whose tracks are on the edge of the bridge. Look out your window down over the edge if you dare!

Earn points by talking to various historically themed characters that you are sharing a ride with. People such as the stalwart conductor, gruff coal miner, aloof rich woman, optimistic upper class gentleman, and more. Get those characters to direct you to look at landmarks to learn about the events of the day in 1915 Edmonton. Earn points when you look in the direction of the arrow that appears, pointing you towards the historical landmark.

This historically accurate first person POV game is fun for people in Edmonton who will recognize many of the buildings still here a century later, as well as entertaining for anyone interested to learn about this bustling and progressive frontier city. To earn 100% (26 conversation points and 6 landmark viewing points) one cannot help but learn a bit of city and era history. Can you get a perfect score? Play it again, until you do.

Included in this purchase is a game with high replay value, that is divided up into 3 main levels of increasing difficulty. In the first level you are on the street where you have no time limit to learn how to operate the game before boarding the trolley, then in the second two levels as you ride the trolley you only have the length of the ride to talk to everyone and see everything before you arrive at the legislature building in downtown Edmonton.

Behind our comfortable, familiar dimensions, beyond the timeless depths of space, there is a Place that mankind was not meant to know. A Place hostile to all life. We do not belong there. We cannot survive there. At least, not for long… Euclidean; a game of geometric horror; a slow descent into the dark, into madness, futility, and despair, where Things greater than you watch and wait and dream. Struggle for every second of life you have left… Even knowing you’re better off dead. Key Features: • An endless faller through tense otherworldly environments • Three difficulty levels: HARD, NIGHTMARISH and IMPOSSIBLE • 9 distinct stages of hand-crafted terror • Terrifying VR support • Binaural 3d audio by 3Deception® • Haunting ambient soundtrack • No zombies

Woeful Woebots is an action-packed arcade shooter made from the ground up for VR!
As the founder of the Woebotics Corporation you find yourself bewildered as your very own robot creations suddenly turn against you. Your awful programming skills somehow let their artificial intelligence run amok and has given them free will. And these guys won't be serving you your afternoon tea with that stuff running their CPU-cores, that's for sure. Maybe they'll serve you some hot lead instead! As their master-creator you have to destroy every single one of them before they do something strikingly similar to you. Grab your guns from your super high-tech hips and blast your way through their filthy electronic meat! 

Shoot evil robots with tactically-minded AI that die when you kill them to death!

Fight it out on three different levels!

Move somewhat freely around the levels by shooting carefully placed target points! 
Use it to your strategical advantage and surprise your enemies.

No motion sickness (almost*) semi-guaranteed in a super-non legally binding way!
I get queezy by most fps style VR movement and I will never have that stuff in my game!

Fight with your friends over who can climb to the top of the Steam Leaderboards or the amazingly innovative local high score list!

Absolutely no multiplayer at all! Be completely free from the pressures of online fighting that could RUIN your FRIENDSHIPS with REAL people!
(yes that's a unique feature!)

* does not apply if you are playing this game on a boat in stormy weather or in a car flying off a cliff or if played on top of a speeding truck while fighting off oncoming traffic

Full support for HTC Vive, Vive Pro and Oculus Touch (3-sensors).
(also playable on Oculus Rift)

ERADICATE MACHINES. SAVE EARTH.
Jump into the middle of the action in Regenesis Arcade, the VR sci-fi shooter set in dystopian future ran by machines. Select one of two locomotion modes (free movement or teleport) and choose from variety of weapons, one for each hand, creating powerful synergies using perks to take the fight to machines.

Most of game’s content will be a bit different every time you play due to a random generation mechanism.

WEAPONS & UPGRADES: INSTRUMENTS OF DESTRUCTION
Collect weapons from each of three categories, that can be upgraded for maximized firepower. From gravity gun, through minigun, shotgun to powerful rocket launcher and wavegun, every weapon comes with its own strengths and weaknesses you need to consider while in the heat of the combat.

KNOW YOUR ENEMY
Fighting the deadly killing machines will not be easy. Coming from all directions, covering both ground and air, each enemy requires different tactical approach. Some will activate shields that either deflect or absorb damage, others will dodge swiftly every shot coming at them or make a kamikaze run right into your face. Do not underestimate your opponent no matter how small it might be!

THE WAR THEATER
In Regenesis Arcade, you will battle through 8 detailed maps in campaign mode, ranging from futuristic cities, through forests to atomic wastelands, in different weather conditions, including a snowy blizzard!

Discover and explore each map’s enemies and weapons drops in order to gain tactical advantage! After you finish the campaign you will continue in game+ mode, that will increase the difficulty and enable all types of enemies and unique weapons to be spawned in each level.

After you unlock a level, you can start campaign from any point you want, getting faster to the further part of the game but not having all the goodies you might have collected if you’d start from the beginning. It’s up to you to either save your time grinding or prepare yourself better for the onslaught!


GLOBAL SCOREBOARD
Feel the spirit of ARCADE competition and fight for the highest score on the global leaderboard! Random generation and long-run nature of the game encourages you to master the levels and the weapons to the point where you can effectively compete for the domination as the ultimate champion without getting bored.

Regenesis Arcade brings the true spirit of retro arcade games into modern environment of Virtual Reality!

Twisted Arrow is a first-person shooter that gives players adrenaline-packed arcade style action. Armed with a top secret combat bow and an arsenal of devastating arrows, you must traverse and fight your way through a city occupied by a high-tech army, mechs, zombies, and chemical monsters.

Twisted Arrow is a full-tilt, no-holds-barred VR-FPS that gives players an adrenaline-packed arcade style game play. Experience urban warfare as never before by immersing yourself in this frenzied fight for survival. THIS IS NOT A WAVE SHOOTER, but a FPS that lets you traverse through a vast city, up and down tall buildings, and position yourself in strategic areas to make the perfect head shot or try using an explosive arrow to launch NPC units 200ft in the air in a fiery ball of fatality! 

Out-manned and outgunned, you are the last line of defense against a high-tech, paramilitary force occupying your city. But don’t feel sorry for yourself, feel sorry for the poor bastard that gets in your way! Armed with the Manticore, the military’s top secret combat bow, and an arsenal of over powered arrows, you will need to fight your way through an enemy armed with high-tech weaponry, armored mechs, attack drones, and a host of biological secrets yet to be uncovered in the remnants of a city on the brink of ruin. Your mission is simple: recon the city, rescue hostages, and get the hell out of dodge while eliminating any and all resistance with extreme prejudice. If it moves, kill it! If it doesn’t move, it’s probably already dead.

01fc6ba4-e24e-476b-9682-b40839614213,The Stanford Ocean Acidification Experience,Free,"Description

Most people have never heard of ocean acidification—the process by which the ocean becomes more acidic as it absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) that has been emitted into the atmosphere. Visualizing the impact to marine is challenging. As a solution, Stanford researchers have produced a virtual underwater ecosystem to allow you to observe firsthand what coral reefs are expected to look like by the end of the century if we do not curb our CO2 emissions.
	
With funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, Stanford researchers have designed an educational experience that makes the impossible possible: watch the ocean absorb invisible CO2 molecules, a coral reef degrade and marine life disappear as the ocean acidifies. Each step in the journey is based on marine science research.

“This simulation shows in rich detail the damage carbon pollution inflicts on our oceans. I appreciate the Stanford Ocean Acidification Experience for calling attention to the peril our oceans face and what we must do to protect them.”
U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse

“One of the things I appreciate most about the virtual reef they have created is that it represents what I actually saw when I was underwater. We worked hard to make it scientifically accurate. This accuracy is really important when we are using this virtual world to teach about the real world.”
Kristy Kroeker - Assistant Professor, Physical and Biological Sciences, Univeristy of California Santa Cruz

“I am thrilled that VR technologies can bring people 'under water' to experience the impacts of ocean acidification. I am so impressed with the realism and accuracy of the VR experience”
Fiorenza Micheli - David & Lucile Packard Professor in Marine Sciences, Stanford University

Trespass – Episode 2 Introduction:

The protagonist, Samuel Rodriguez wakes up and finds himself in an unfamiliar location.
He will revisit and attempt to escape from locations connected to his past and along the way uncover the mysteries behind his forgotten past.


“I regained consciousness in what seemed to be some kind of detention facility.
With a lot of difficulty, I made it out of the hall
only to appear in my own home,
the home I shared together with Jess.

She spoke to me in such a way
that she didn’t know about the strange situation I was finding myself in.
She spoke to me so ordinarily as if everything was alright.
No, something about it was a little off.

She told me not to follow her but even as I tried,
I found myself between two high-rise buildings with a narrow bridge connecting the two.

Fear suddenly gripped me.
Not because I found myself having to cross a tightrope between two buildings.
But it was an ominous feeling that I might lose her.

Finally, at the end of a dark hallway,
I see my wife once again.

What’s the dreaded meaning of this game of hide and seek?
And what are these absurd locations and experiences?

These things that I seeing and hearing,
Is it reality or just a dream?

I have to figure out what’s going on.”

Gameplay:

Trespass – Episode 2 is a game intended to test your cognitive abilities. Escape from various locations, all of which have unique objectives whether it’s searching for hints in a morgue through interacting with the surrounding objects or making your way through a military facility using various weapons and explosives.
Everything you need to escape is there. It’s all a matter of using your observational skills and thinking outside of the box.

1942 - the Germans have lost the battle for control over the Atlantic. The once feared Grey Wolves are on the run and the German WWII U-boat fleet is suffering heavy losses. In 'Das Boot VR Demise' you are trained to command a German World War II submarine on the mission to intercept and sink enemy freighters to interrupt the supply line of the allied forces. This unique interactive VR experience is based on the successful 2018 TV series 'Das Boot' and the legendary original 'Das Boot' movie.

Will you be successful on the hunt and save your sailors and the U-boat from sinking to the deep and unforgiving sea?

Immerse yourself as the captain and steer the fully interactive WWII U-boat silently through hostile waters. Use the periscope to search for your targets and enemy warships. Dive deeper and switch to silent running when allied ships are closing in. Close the valves to avoid water breaking in and keep a cool head when depth charges hit the hull. Relive the most intense moment of the legendary 'Das Boot' and experience the tension of naval warfare under the sea in this 8- 10 minute single-player experience.

In 2049 the Singularity took place. A.I. destroyed humanity. 
A few human survivors fled to Mars. Now it’s time to come back and ... 
... clean up the mess! 

Trash Rage is an post-apocalyptic arcade-style VR game. Your goal is to catch and sort trash/rubbish using your exoskeleton. Two funky robots throw trash at you (encapsulated in colored bubbles) and you have to sort the trash according to those colors. You must watch out for explosive mines, oil blobs and other objects that might slow you down. If you get really good, you can upgrade to ""Brain Blow"" to try without the colored bubbles - you have to sort by recognizing objects alone. It gets really intensive! There are also helper features like slow motion and Trash Rage to explore. We prepared many cool combos to score more points with. Try to find those combos on your own. Have fun!

Features
- Simple - Just catch and throw.
- Fun - You have to use your body. Sometimes better then a workout ;)
- Accessible - Play the game in just a few seconds.
- Challenging - The game requires reflex and spatial awareness. You really have to think 360!
- Educational - Trash Rage explores the impact of humans on the planet.

8fc81f9c-719a-40da-b53f-860c64c45cde,Narcosis,"¥2,199","Description

Survival, horror at the sunless depths of the Pacific Ocean. Stranded on the seafloor with low light and few tools, an industrial diver takes desperate steps to surface before his oxygen — and sanity — give out.

Conceived as a student project, this first person survival story unfolds following an industrial catastrophe, from inside a half-ton, high-tech dive suit — a “walking coffin."" Influenced and inspired by a growing appetite for unconventional horror and narrative-driven games, Narcosis is rooted in reality, but steeped in the surreal.

Features:
+ Pressure Kills: High-stress situations accelerate oxygen intake, distorting sight, sound, space and time.
+ Hostile Waters: A knife, flashlight and flares are essential to surviving the nightmarish flora and fauna of the abyss.
+ Phantom Narrative: The survivor’s account unfolds in inexplicable ways alongside the player’s journey.
+ Beyond Good and Evil: No shadowy organizations or eldritch terrors at Narcosis’ dark heart,  only primal fears and human limits.
Terror Verite: Primal fears — darkness, confinement and isolation — take on new levels of immersion when experienced in VR.

About Honor Code:
Based in France and California, Honor Code’s collective resume includes such games and series as Assassin’s Creed, Dance Central, Metal Gear Solid, Remember Me, Republique, The Silent Age, and Silent Hill.
(also playable on Oculus Rift)

Echo Grotto is a virtual reality experience that lets you explore unique and intricate cave systems using a range of caving gear and tools!

Traverse underwater tunnels, huge open caverns, crystal caves, massive ravines, sulfur pools, deep pits, glow-worm lit grottos and much more!

Echo Grotto uses subtle random generation to make every cave system feel unique, while still delivering amazing locations and deeply interconnected caves since every cavern and passage is handmade and uniquely designed.
Each time you embark down into the caves of Echo Grotto you will never know what’s around the corner!

Before you descend into a new cave system you can choose what gear you want to take with you. You might choose another locomotion method (like a grappling hook) or maybe an additional light source like a headlamp or lantern. 
Maybe you would rather take a snorkel with you so that you can reach the underwater portions of the caves? Or maybe a flare gun to easily light up things in the distance. 
There are many different tools to choose from!

You can explore the caves using a unique teleportation system, where you throw a small ‘teleporter lamp’ and you will be teleported to where it lands. This lamp will leave a trail of previous lamps behind you, resulting in a trail of lights that leads you back the way you came! 
Much like how cavers would leave a string behind them as they go, your teleporters leave a wire and trail of lights for you to retrace your steps.

Another locomotion option is a pair of caving hooks, which you can use to freely ""grab and move"" yourself around the environment!

Choose to play as either an 'experience' or a 'game'. Choosing 'experience' will allow you to pick whatever gear you want from the start and simply explore the caves as you wish, while choosing 'game' will include a progression system, where you start with only basic tools and must search for more within the caves. 
It also employs a simple currency system, where you can use various gemstones found within the caves to get better tools!

You can also play a range of special ‘scenarios’ which alter the gameplay in unique ways. For example, you can explore a flooded cave system, start the game from an alternative entrance or play with nothing but glowsticks! 
Some scenarios are like special challenges, like starting the game already deep into a cave system with only a candle (which will run out over time!).

You will also find a range of cave-dwelling creatures in Echo Grotto.
Keep an eye out for snails, eels and wetas! But if you’re not a fan of creepy-crawlies you can always set which animals can be found in the caves (or even none at all).

Go and see for yourself what’s deep in the caves of Echo Grotto!

Dawn lights up with strange insects in the clearing of an ancient forest. Above you a rabble of starlings flits and starts. You are their guide and their trainer and they know you as Mother. You have taught them since birth to love and to follow The Golden Orbs. As you swing them in great arcs around your head, or in tight figure eights, or in alternating spirals, your flock swoops and flows in pursuit. It is this way that you teach them to feed and help them to live.

Flock for Vive is a single player translation of a multi-user, co-located VR experience which premiered at the Future of Storytelling Festival in New York. 

Flock is an interactive music video with a score composed by Tim Fain and Julien Mier. Players swing Golden Orbs around on strings. The Orbs attract birds which eat the bugs that the surround you. As bugs are eaten the music and imagery transitions through a psychedelic rainbow of light and color.

Escape a merciless mansion alongside a girl words cannot reach, in a tale that can only be experienced in VR.

An escape-the-room adventure game that can only be experienced in VR, Last Labyrinth was created specifically for the VR age. Players must work to escape a mansion full of hidden dangers with a mysterious girl that appears before them.

Development of Last Labyrinth is being spearheaded by Hiromichi Takahashi, director and producer of the acclaimed Doko Demo Issyo (PlayStation® 1999) series and co-creator of Toro (the Sony Cat). Working alongside him is Co-Director Tetsuya Watanabe, previously a game designer on Puppeteer and The Last Guardian (in-game physics); Lead Animator Atsuko Fukuyama, best known for her work in animating the non-verbal characters that players work alongside with in ICO and Shadow of the Colossus; Lead Environment Artist Michiko Kusaba, who worked as a Landscape Designer on Gran Turismo 3:A-Spec and Gran Turismo 4; and Sound Designer Takuya Hanaoka, whose past works include Monster Rancher and the Super Robot Wars series.

With resumes featuring titles that are household names around the world, the team is now taking on the unique challenges of creating a VR game that revolves around “non-verbal communication”, and are committed to bringing Katia and the world of Last Labyrinth to life.

Katia is voiced by none other than international model, actress, voice-actress and singer, Stefanie Joosten, who was also the voice and model for the silent and deadly Quiet in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.

The theme song is composed by renowned video game music composer Hiroki Kikuta, famous for his work on titles such as Seiken Densetsu 2 and 3 and Sōkaigi, among others. Following her performance on ""Quiet's Theme"", Stefanie Joosten once again lends her vocal talents for the Last Labyrinth theme song.

STORY
What the…?!

Your eyes begin to adjust to the darkness, and you find yourself in a room you’ve never seen before. You go to stand but are barely able to move. You look down to find that your arms and legs are strapped to a wheelchair.

As the panic begins to set it, you catch a glimpse of a figure out of the corner of your eye.

!?

A young girl, standing in the darkness, stares at you with cold eyes…

TOKYO CHRONOS is the VR game that has multiple-choice decision points as well as more than one ending. It has a long story you’ve never experienced before with VR.
The game takes place in Shibuya, Tokyo, which has only eight people, including you, the protagonist, Kyosuke Sakurai. Why are they there? How can they break out of the enclosed world? More than that, what is the reason causing this strange phenomenon?
Can Kyosuke solve the mystery and get out of the silent Shibuya?

-Features-
● Drastic advancement of visual novel games with VR
The total gameplay time reaches to 15 hours. The story has multiple-choice decision points as well as more than one ending.

●Moving scenario making your HMD wet with your tears
One review says, “I’ve purchased several games at the Oculus store, and none of them satisfied me. But TOKYO CHRONOS is no comparison. At first, you’re surprised at the beautiful images. But the deep story surpasses it”.

●Game experiences only with VR
You can experience the opening and ending music videos with 360 degrees as well as interactions with the heroines at a very close range.

-Synopsis-
Spring, 2018.
Kyosuke Sakurai – you – awaken in the city of Shibuya, Tokyo, oddly quiet and devoid of its bustle.
Nobody is around. The only exception is the group of eight childhood friends, which you used to be a part of.
As the group gathers in the city’s famous scramble crossing, a blood-red message suddenly flashes on a nearby large electronic billboard.
“I am dead. Who killed me?”
If this world is similar to the Chronos Worlds that emerged in the past, there is only one way to out- to find the one causing this strange phenomenon and kill the culprit.

If you are going to learn about stoichiometry, you might as well watch an animation to figure it out. This challenging concept is suddenly a lot more fun and easy once you enter the VictoryVR world. As always, VictoryVR curriculum may be fun and fascinating, but each unit is tied to Next Gen Science Standards so that it is directly tied to learning in today’s classrooms. -Solve puzzles and brain games to get out of the escape house. -Learn about chemical reactions at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway -Coronal mass ejections?

It’s a self-guided tour so move around at your own pace and take a look at both the skeleton and the non-skeletal animal. You can even spin and turn the whale ancestor to get a full view. The field trip is one of the craziest of all 48 we shot. Our host explores the world of invasive species, in this case, the destructive Asian Carp. Watch as he investigates their journey to Middle America and then watch as they relentlessly attack him as he journeys down a river in a boat. It’s like nothing you’ve ever seen. Wendy, our national runner-up teacher of the year, explores the blue crab and its evolutionary journey.

Sometimes humans get a little help from machines. Wendy Martin is our national runner-up teacher of the year and she explores the concept of prosthetics: artificial limbs and human parts. 

Then you will enter the liquid surround display as we learn the science behind helmets, why and how they protect our heads. Forces and physics are a key part of this 360 surround experience. 

As always, VictoryVR learning is fun, immersive and amazing. At the same time, our curriculum specialist is meticulous about making sure each lesson is tied to a national science standard as created through the Next Gen Science Standards. 

We have 48 units covering every area of middle and high school science. If you plan to learn science, might as well do it in virtual reality.

When you strap on the VR headset, get ready to head underwater because this unit is in our underwater research lab. If you’re going to learn about genetics, why not do it in the underwater lab? 

But just because you’re underwater, it doesn’t mean you cannot take a side trip to an ancient library that holds the secrets to your genetics and chromosomes. Each of the ancient manuscripts will tell you what each of your 23 chromosomes does and beware the floating head and the hovering eyeballs.

The story of Gregor Mendel is an important one and in our VR world, it’s told in a comic book. Enter the candle lit room, turn on the radio (choose your favorite classical station) and open the comic to learn about how Mendel discovered genetic traits. 

Take a field trip to a vineyard where we learn about the genetic traits of grapes, of all things. And Wendy the Science  Teacher, shows us the mysteries hiding within our chromosomes when we take a genetic test.

Then take a journey through a special museum where you can travel around the cylindrical building seeing lifesize human cells and seeing the almost magical science of cells come to life right in front of your eyes. What’s even more cool is that you control your own travel. When you’re done with one exhibit, you can magically teleport to the next location. 

Here’s the thing, it’s important to learn science (in fact, very important) but it doesn’t have to be boring or intimidating. In our virtual world, science comes to life and becomes amazing and immersive. Suddenly science is fun and cool and that’s what you want. 

Oh, for teachers, the entire unit is based on Next Gen Science Standards.

-If you’re going to learn about genetics, do it immersed in our virtual world. 
-This unit occurs in our underwater research lab.
-Take a side trip to the ancient library and open magical books that hold the mysteries of our chromosomes.

-Take a journey in a special museum where you control your teleporting as you visit amazing lifesize experiences all based on cellular division.
