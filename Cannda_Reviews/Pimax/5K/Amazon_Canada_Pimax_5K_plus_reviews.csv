I love my Pimax5K+. Used to have the oculust rift but glad I moved on to this. No more binocular vision. I use this headset mainly for flight sims and Elite Dangerous. Only negative I have is the fact that the display is lcd which as we all know do no justice to black levels when in dark scenes. But with the pitool you can improve it with the contrast/lcd settings. Still wish for LED but as of today 2020 all headsets on the market are using LCD so no choice there.Overall happy with my pimax5K+ until next gen headsets.

If you value FOV in a 144hz capable headset, and dont mind a bit of setup, look no further. The 144hz mode still has a much higher fov than the Valve index', while retaining comparable sharpness to the HP Reverb G2; if you only play racing games or flight sims, this is the only headset you should consider- unless you're not in its' IPD range. There is slight distortion around the very edges but it's not all that noticeable in-game.in terms of setup you may have to purchase a custom face foam to replace/retrofit the existing foam, much of the eyestrain complaints come from having the lens too close/far from one's eyes and you can only adjust that by modding the foam. Deluxe audio strap is also recommended(gotta 3d print an adapter/retrofit youself), anything to replace the default strap. Add in a counterweight to the rear ( i used a battery bank) and you got on of the best VR headsets on the market

Vive・RiftといったVR機器からの乗り換え先として5K Plusを選んだ眼鏡利用によるVRユーザーです。結果としては大満足で、高視野角と高精細な描画の効果を非常に感じることが出来ています。最初に実感したのは文字の読みやすさで、ViveやRiftでは細かな字は顔を近づけないと読めない状態でしたが、5K PlusではVR内でデスクトップ表示を行った際の文字も大分自然かつシャープに判別することが出来ました。精細に映るのは文字だけではなくテクスチャも同様で、4Kテクスチャを入れていたゲームでは肌の皺や汚れや化粧、動物の毛並み、建造物や道具などの使い古した様子など長時間遊んでいても認識できなかった描画に気づかされ、これによっても臨場感が引き上げられたことに驚きました。より精細さを増すために、v1.0.0.109のPiToolでSmart Smoothingを有効・Parallel Projectionsを無効にしたうえでレンダリングクオリティやSteamVR内のSSを上げて動かしています。/_/_/_/_/ 5/19追記 /_/_/_/_/キャラの動きが速いアクション系ソフトではSmart Smoothing無効でSSを左右合計7kほどの解像度に設定し、ソフト上にてアンチエイリアス が標準で掛かっていた場合はOFFにする事が効果的でした。90fpsの滑らかな動きと、ストライプRGBの高精細パネルだからこそと思えるシャープな映像を両立でき、得られたMOD入りオープンワールドのVR映像は次元が違うと感じました。ですがソフトによっては解像度を落とさないと90fpsで動かせないものもあるため、要調整です。/_/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/また最大の特徴の左右・上下高視野角の効果も大きく、視野いっぱいに巨大モンスターが迫り覆いかぶさってくる際の迫力なども大きく引き上げられました。単純にオープンワールド上を走り回るだけの行為でも、風景が後ろへ流れていくという当たり前のことを体感可能になり、現実感が引き上げられたと感じます。上記世代のVR機器では、立体視しているものの、一般モニタのように前方の平面的視野だったと今だと思えます。他機種と比べ特殊な形状のフレネルレンズが使われていますが、ゴッドレイはRiftよりも抑えられているようです。これらの要素が合わさった5K PlusのVR描写により、よりリアルな空間で快適に過ごせるようになりました。なお快適さを向上するため、Vive用のオーディオストラップを取り付け、あえてサイズは小さいものの18mmの厚みがある通常版vive用フェイスクッションを2個利用しています。viveフェイスクッションを内側の縁に沿って押し広げてHMDに貼り付けると、ちょうどクッションのコーナー部分が眼鏡のテンプルを逃がすHMDの切り欠き部分に来て隙間が作られます。2個目のフェイスクッションはおでこの部分を切り出し、HMD下方の空いているスペースに貼ることで全周をカバーしました。こうすることでクッション性と眼鏡スペースを確保しつつ視野角も出来るだけ保たせ、また鼻の広い空きスペースが埋まったことで、遮光性を向上させることが出来ています。特性としては良いHMDですが、あくまでVR機器やデジタル機器を使い慣れている人向けの製品とも感じています。私の環境ではマザーボード上のUSBポートでは機器の認識不安定化やトラッキング不可の症状が発生し、電源付きUSB増設カードのKT4001を利用すると安定化しました。機器電源のON, OFFの手順によってはHMDの画面に横線のノイズが入った状態になる、コントローラーのペアリングが出来ているのにPiTool上で一方だけ認識されないなどその他細々とした挙動もあります。ですがまだまだ日本語でのトラブル解決への情報はまとまっておらず数も少ない状態です。現状は自分でいろいろ情報を集め考えることが要求される機器との認識は持つ必要があると思われます。

I took a leap and purchased the Pimax 5K+ after seeing reviews on sim racing comparing the increased FOV. It has to be experienced to understand just how much more you can see while sim racing & the clarity which provides better viewing of signs & markers in the distance. I do notice slight warping on the edges, but to me in sim racing, this adds to the feeling of speed in an view area you a rarely focused on.The headset is also lighter which reduces the fatigue I would get from the Vive with Wireless adaptor. It is difficult to go back to the Vive binocular style FOV, but I do when I want wireless freedom in room scale.Cons:- I have a 4 monitor sim racing setup (triples + stats above) & so I run out of ports to plug the Pimax in (DP). Would be great if some headset manufacturers included compatibility / adaptors to use with the USB-C ports on RTX cards.- Tracking doesn't feel as smooth / accurate as the Vive when trying games in Room scale, so I tend to still use my Vive with the wireless adaptor.- Would be great if they could work out a wireless implementation, even if it had to reduce the FOV/Hz.Overall, I am excited to see reviews on the upcoming Pimax 8KX & will consider upgrading.

Pros:The VR experience is amazing, specifically the field of view and resolution.compatibility is also great. no problems there.fits large glasses.minimal screen door effect.Cons:For the price, the build quality is very very poor. This is not an exaggeration. The plastic feels like that of a toy's. A cheap toy at that. This is also no exaggeration. The strap velcro is also weak, and the stitches are already looking worn out after only 1 week of use.The strap is also very uncomfortable. The area where your nose goes has no foam or soft material! it is simply a thin fabric covering a rough plastic.The quality of the wire also feels poor. especially the power adapter. Would have been great if the man cable was removable.Light shafts/god rays through the lens are also visible at times.for the price, I do not recommend this product. It will be better to buy a vive with everything included for a lower price.

視野角と解像度については良いと思いますがそれ以外は無印vive に勝てません。VR体験は視野角や解像度が重要なのではなくて感じるストレスがより少ない方が没入できると言うことがよく分かりました。トラッキング性能も非常に悪いですし色味も白っぽくて特にくらいエリアでは総合的に画質は悪いです。また、いきなり使えなくなったり使えるようになったりとまだ製品として売り出すにははやいのでは？と思ってしまいました。私の買った本体の不具合なのかなのかもしれませんが。正直HTCやOculusも広視野角、高解像度の製品作ろうと思えば作れるにでしょうが総合的に製品として出荷するためには何を優先してコストを割くか考えた上での今の製品群なんだと思います。多分ほとんどの人が買って後悔すると思いますね。

Coming from oculus Rift. The first time you put this on you're amazed by the FOV and sharpness.But the novelty starts to wear off fairly quickly. It's uncomfortable and tracking isn't very good. I didn't have the lighthouses.I bought a DAS ($150) and this improved the comfort and tracking massively. But the lenses would still rest on the bridge of my nose. Everytime I used the Pimax I had a headache that lingered for a few hours no matter what I did with the IPD.But the one thing that really killed it for me was the SDE, I just couldn't stop focusing on the SDE. That was the final straw and I returned it. At this price point the Pimax needs to be a whole lot better.I only use VR for iRacing and I'll get either the HP reverb or Valve Index next.I can't recommend the Pimax.

A very good upgrade from Vive. It just works with your existing base stations/controllers.Nice wide fov, higher resolution, minimal screen door. Noticeably clearer and sharper than vive.Pimax software is hit and miss. Works great on some titles, not at all on others. (This will hopefully improve soon.)I only use this for DCS in which it is excellent.You will need to fiddle with it to get it comfortable. I use a Vive DAS with 3D printed adapters. The default strap is not great.A solid headset with some unique features. But you may need to be patient with the software and fit.

トータルで後悔８割です。VIVE無印BS.Vu1からの乗り換えですがVIVEのコントローラーがずれて表示され判定もずれるのでビートセイバーが出来なくなります。画質もそこそこVIVE無印から上がっているように見えるだけでホラゲで黒色が白くなり明るくなります。そのあたりはHMD側の設定でバックライトを暗くすれば解消するようですが。本機はPitoolを導入してからSteamVRで認識させ使用するのですが、SteamVRで手の部分が高速で震えます。インスコし直したり手を尽くしましたが改善されませんでした。すべてが安定して動作確認が取れるまでは購入しない方が無難と思われます。2019/11/04ちなみに、VIVE無印使用時にBSの電源を自動OFFに設定している人は自動OFF機能が使えなくなります。理由は詳しくわかりませんが、恐らく、VIVEのゴーグルからBSへBluetooth接続しておるようでヘッドセットからもコントローラーの位置を補正してういるように感じました。ヘッドセットを交換した形でPimaxに変えたのですが「そうしたらVIVEのコントローラーは使えなくなるじゃないか」と思わるかもしれませんがPC本体とBSとでBluetooth接続しており、その接続では自動OFF機能は認識されなく、SteamVRでBluetooth接続が認識されないので設定できない。という状況が発生するようです。（当方の場合。どちらにせよコントローラーの位置がおかしく表示されるのは非常に残念でした。試行錯誤するのが好きな人にはいいと思います。

専門的な知識はありませんのであくまで私個人の感覚で、Pimax5KPlusVRの感想とVive無印との比較も述べさせていただきます＜環境＞◆HTC Vive無印を半年間使用し、200°の視野と高い解像度が気になりPimaxも購入。◆Pimax本体のみ購入し、ベースステーションとコントローラーはViveの物を流用。◆ノートPCを使用（OMEN by HP 17-cb0003TX・ビデオカード:RTX2070）＜良い点＞◆視野が広く、Vive無印の1.5倍くらいの視野が得られ開放感がある。◆Vive無印には目をこらしてよく見ると細かいドット感があるが、Pimaxではドット感が無く滑らか。◆トラブルに対しての連絡後、2・3日でメーカーのテクニカルサポートより連絡があり、遠隔操作によるドライバー更新と最適設定により問題が解決された。◆仕事上、Vive無印ではSketchUpの建築データでVR体験をしていました。Pimaxでもドライバ更新により機器が認識され、とても解放感のVR建築プレゼンが可能になった。◆Virtual Castへの接続も問題ありませんでした。＜改善点＞◆商品が届き初回の起動時は問題無く作動し、レビューの大半に書いてあるような問題もなく安心していたが2回目の起動時以降、PCがHMDを認識せず何度再起動してもダメでした。ドライバーに問題があるのかな？（テクニカルサポートにより改善済）◆売り文句として「200度の視野角は人間の自然な視野角に近い・・・」とあるが、見える視野の中で解像度が高い部分は中央辺りの範囲のみであり（Vive無印と同じ程度の範囲）、視野が広がった部分はモザイクがかかったように粗いドットとなっている。（使用しているとその事も忘れるくらい没頭しますが・・・）◆日本語の接続マニュアル、Pitoolの説明があるともう少しわかりやすく安心するのですが。＜Pitool設定について＞◆「視野角」の設定があり、狭い・普通・広いの３つが選択ができる。感覚的に”普通”を100とすると、狭い：普通：広い＝70：100：105くらいの視野でした。ここの設定は”普通”で問題ないと感じました。ちなみに不具合時のテクニカルサポートによるベストセッティングでも”広い”から”普通”に変更された。◆SketchUpでのVRですが、Pitoolの「スマートフレーム」はチェックを外した方が映像の微振動みたいなのが消え全体的に綺麗になる。（Viveでも同じように「モーションスムージング」のチェックを外すと映像の振動が止まって綺麗）＜アフターサービスについて＞①PIMAX - Amazon マーケットプレイスへ症状を連絡②Pimaxより返信があり、指定のURLへ再度症状を伝えるとアフターサービスナンバーが発行された。（英語でのメール対応はGoogle翻訳利用で問題なし）③メールにてテクニカルサポートとのSkype会話の日時決め、指定の遠隔操作ソフト”teamviewer”を事前インストール。その時のテクニカルサポート対応時間は、月曜日-金曜日13：30- 22:30 pm（上海時間）だった。④指定日時にSkypeにて待機、テクニカルサポートの指示に従い遠隔操作にて再インストールとベストセッティングが施され、HMDでの確認依頼があり、試してみると問題なく起動した。私の場合は機器の不具合ではなく、ドライバーの更新がうまくされていなかったようで、管理者権限にて再インストールしたとの事だった。※必須ツールは”Skype”と”teamviewer”で、Skypeはリアルタイム日本語翻訳がある為、まったく不都合は無く、サポートの対応もかなり丁寧である。＜総合判断＞安定感ではViveが抜群であるのは確かで、初めてのVR購入やPC初心者など、問題などに奮闘する事を避けたい方はViveをお薦めします。既にVive無印使用者であれば、ベースステーションとコントローラーを流用しPimaxにグレードアップ（乗り換え）すると視野の解放感UPのメリットは必ず感じると思います。Viveには戻れません・・・。今後も安定した動作を願うばかりです。

・画質、解像度、視野・VIVE.Rift(110°)やWinMR(100°前後)などであった視野の窮屈感のせいでゲームの世界から現実に引き戻されることがありましたが、圧倒的な200°でさらに片目2560×1440という解像度はゲームの世界に入らせてくれます。一度使うとVIVE PROに戻れません・・・・装着感・横に長いため大きさの割に重さを感じれず、重量はほぼVIVEと一緒ですが、より軽く感じ、ストレスなくプレイできます。最近ではフェイスクッションの改良やノーズレスト、とかのオプションも試作の最終段階がおわったみたいな情報があって、さらに純正オーディオストラップオプションなどの販売もするそうなので期待してます！・ソフトウェア・公式のPitoolはアップデートの頻度がすごくて、以前のような不安定感はないです。最近では日本語表示も対応して、さらに垂直方向の補正機能等細かい設定ができるので、自分好みに変更できます。・サポート・ここが以前は大問題でしたが、最近日本修理工場、日本倉庫、日本サポートを導入しているみたいで、公式への問い合わせも日本語でOKでした。私のところに届いたのはトラッキングしない不具合がある物で、日本語で問い合わせたところ日本語で対応していただけました。(日本人？)返品の際には日本国内へ送って、新しいを頂きました。この間なんと一週間もありませんでした。本当に素早い対応とても感謝しております。ソフトウェアやバグで問題あったときは「TeamViewer」という物を使い、遠隔操作で調整や修正などを行ってくれるみたいです。なんと問い合わせはTwitterからもできるみたいで、代理店兼日本サポートの「@teru2783」という方がやっていて、私はPimaxの情報をこの方より最新の情報を仕入れていました。私はアマゾンで購入しましたが、安く買う方法もこの方をみればわかるかも...?・不満点・HTCのコントローラーやベースステーションがあったので本体のみを購入して使用することができたのですが、本体以外の発売が遅れていて純正のみを集めて使うことはまだできません。発売延期は日常茶飯事ですので、我慢しましょう...また、高性能のため要求スペックが非常に高いのでつよつよPCが必要です...ゲームによるとは思いますが、特にグラフィックボードで5KPlusであれば最低でもGTX1070Tiは必要だと思いました。・総合的に・やはりメリット、デメリットあるとは思いますが、視野が強すぎてやはり敵う者がありません。断トツでおすすめのVRで、一度使ったら二度と既存の110°のVRには戻れないでしょう。私は戻れません！！！！さらに上位の8KX開発中のようですので出たらぜひお金に余裕があればぜひなんとか入手できればいいなと思っています！今後の展開をとても楽しみにしていますので、どんどんVR市場で進撃を続けて頂きたいです:)

2019年5月に購入したときは解像度・視野角は想定通りだったものの、それまで使っていた無印Viveに比べて色味が悪く（LCDなのでOLEDに比べて色あせて見える）少しがっかりしたのですが、PiToolのアップデートによって色調補正ができるようになり、唯一の弱点が克服され、現在は全体として非常に満足しています。PiToolのアップデートで完全に化けましたね。何気に120Hzモードも追加されています。ただこれはBeat Saberでしか実感できませんでした。VRChat等ではほとんど変化は感じられないと思います。電源を入れる順番を意識しないとちゃんとコントローラやトラッカーを認識しなかったり、不安定な部分があるので、人を選ぶ機器だと思いますが、これで得られるVR体験がそれらすべてを払拭してくれます。一度ケーブルの不調があってサポートに連絡したのですが、公式サイトから連絡してもなしのつぶてで、もしかしたらと思ってAmazonのメッセージセンターからつっついてみたらすぐに返信がありました。ただしこちらに連絡しても公式サイトでチケットを発行しろと言われると思いますが、それで反応がない場合はもう一度Amazon側からつっついてみることをおすすめします。日本語OKとなっていますが完全に機械翻訳のそれなので、英語ができる人は英語でやりとりしたほうがスムーズに話がすすむと思います。

筆者は無印viveからの乗り換え。現状、自身のPC構成(gtx1080/i7-9700K)では最高画質でスムーズなプレイができているわけではないので限定的なレビューになる。要約すると良い点・液晶による高精細・他にはない高視野角(素晴らしい。世界が変わる！)・目立ちにくい縦横のスクリーンドア(網目)悪い点・当たり前だが要求スペックが高いこと・少し薄めの色合い(気になる人は気になるかも)・アイドル時の謎惑星以下詳細なレビュー↓・外観などについて　外観はややチープ。落としたら盛大に壊れそうに思う。装着感については標準ストラップのhtc viveと同程度に感じる。大きめの眼鏡だが無理なく装着できた。ACアダプターも一昔前のおもちゃ用のようなつるっとした質感の物がついてきて、細かいところでコストダウンを図っているなという印象。ただ、一番大事なHMD用USB&Displayportの線などはしっかりとしたもののようだ。・映り方について　画質：画質設定を下げた状態でもそれなりに高精細に見える。流石に遠景などは少々ギザギザ感が出るが、初代vive等の第一世代と比べるともちろん細かい部分まで視認できる仕上がりになっている。もしも良いGPUを積んでいるならより高精細に見えるかもしれない。視野角：文句なしに最高。素晴らしい。このためだけに買う価値は絶対にある。真後ろのキャラクターを見るのに180度回転せずとも100度ほどの回転から横目で見えるのには感動した！しかし、最大視野角設定にするとかなりPCに無理をさせることになるので、PCによっては大変かもしれない。世界が変わることは確実。端のゆがみもそんなに感じられない(眼鏡ユーザーなのでそもそもレンズがない部分をそんなに横眼で見ないのもあるかも)色合い：液晶モデルという事で確実に色は薄いものの、個人的には許容範囲。専用ソフトで色調補正ができるのもあり、こだわらない限りあまり問題がなく思う。悪く言うなら迫力不足、良く言うなら目にやさしくて疲れにくい感じ。スクリーンドア(網目)：有機ELの斜め網目から液晶の横網目になった。もちろんゼロにはなっていないがかなり少ないと思う。液晶の横網目になったことで一つ一つのドットが四角くなり、遠景の小さいオブジェクトだと四角いちらつきやピクセル感が出てくるが、ここは正直好みの問題かもしれない。自分は斜め網より好きなので満足。・接続などその他接続はもともとvive環境なら簡単ですぐ移行できるように思う。初回、USBドライバのインストールが上手くいかなかったようで一度ドライバを削除してから再接続したが、その後は問題なく動いている。PCのスリープ後などに認識されなくなった場合はタスクマネージャーからPiServiceLauncherを再起動すると再認識されるようだ。ここは少々めんどくさい。アイドル時に表示されるpimaxオリジナルの謎惑星が妙に重く、アイドルさせながらの作業がしにくいのが難点。これは何らかの方法で表示を切るか、さっさとsteamVRをつけるしかなさそうでちょっと不満。・まとめ長々と書いてしまったが、タイトルにある通り大満足。本当に素晴らしい！の一言で、買って良かったと思っている。何よりもこの高視野角は他では味わえない特権、どうあれ価値ある買い物になると思う。

I have the latest processor with a 1080 TI Nvidia card...and it struggles. So - NO Steam VR overlay for now...PROS: Beautifully wide field of view...higher resolution - less screen door.CONS: Your going to need some serious hardware to push the pixels in this HMDI will post further info as I upgrade my 3D card.EDIT UPDATE:  - After two months of video card upgrades (ended up with a 2080 ti & and it's STILL not enough horsepower) and working with configurations - I CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS HMD AT THIS TIME.My two fave VR games are listed above and I can't get a decent looking picture with high enough frame rates that doesn't make me VR sick.It's like there is zero support or improvements coming from PIMAX...none of the new PiTool config tools are working properly. The IPD is not properly configured so eyestrain is the norm.Forget about any of the neat accoutrements that made this HMD attractive in the first place - No sign of the hand tracking module or base stations...There are some nice VR offerings coming out from Steam & Oculus - I'd be looking at those instead.

PiTool isn't that bad these days.. has a lot of nice bells and whistles, I never felt lost during the setupFOV is unquestionably good -- everyone is right, the distortions really don't matterBut the colors man.. the blacks, but also every color.. soo washed outAnd the screen door.. I feel like I'm looking at a monitorSamsung Odyssey+ nailed SDE + color so well I'm really torn.. I'm scared to get a 5K XR both because it's even more money + it may still be far from Ody+ screen qualityOverall, a good upgrade from a Vive or Rift, bad lateral move from Ody+But good luck if a lens comes messed up or a cord is busted.. they won't do anything no matter how many times you contact them

Why everybody compare valve index to rift s but nobody compare it to pimax 5k+?Oculus rift s is a toy. Small FOV, low res, big SDE, 80Hz refresh. Good price.Valve index with small FOV, just a little bit bigger than oculus is a huge disappointment. Pimax 5k+ when you set small FOV option is still bigger than valve index!!! Also pimax has better screen door effect, better resolution and no god ray.Sound quality and comfort -> valve index is the winner. For pimax you will need deluxe audio strips and vive face foam replacement.Refresh rate also valve index is number one. But to keep 144hz  you need minimum rtx2080TiIf comfort is more important than image quality then valve index is better option. if you care about clear image, huge FOV and no SDE then pimax 5k+ is the best for you.Also now with PiTool v. 144 you can change every single color, contrast and brightness!!!i'm a gamer and I care about top quality image. Outside details are not important for me. Already returned valve index and pimax 5k+ is my number one HMD.Advice for the future: get valve knuckles only and pair them with pimax. Great experience!!!

 Ordered it over the weekend with the plan to take the week off and play some DCS all week. Haven't flown VR since DK2 early CV1 release. Overall I think it has the potential, however my unit has a faulty LCD in the right eye. Even though this is advertised at 120hz, I don't have an option to run it beyond 90hz through PiTool (version 1.0.1.180 Beta) -- EVEN with the Small FOV selected, there is no 120hz option. The screen in the right eye has a blatent tear horizontally across it right in the middle, and the lower half of the screen flickers really bad. I can get it to run somewhat stable at 72hz but it just isn't worth it to me to have such a low refresh rate when I bought a ""120hz"" headset -- at the very least I should get the max 90hz on all FOV settings.The comfort does not fit me either, I have a fairly large nose bridge, and this thing just sits on top of it with my 62mm IPD. I've tried adjusting the straps, but it seems the common theme is to ditch it and get a Deluxe Audio Strap from a Vive. Seems like a pretty crappy option to me, just give us a strap that doesn't suck.The face pad is terrible. it has no nose support, and if you have a large nose with a more narrow IPD, your nose will be crushed between the lenses.Overall, I will be returning my unit. I'm tempted to get either a Vive Index or HP Reverb, or just go budget and get a Samsung Odyssey Plus to hold me over until the next generation of GPU and headsets come out. I don't think the 5k+ is worth any more than 300$. I would not recommend this until Pimax gets their head out of their ass and starts delivering on their product. How hard would it have been to have someone just plug it in and run it for 5-10 minutes to ensure the LCD wasn't dead? It's a premium niche product, at a premium price, without all the included bells and whistles on something like a Rift S or Index...Update: I was going to order a second unit to give it another go, but I've decided to go with the HP Reverb, it has a higher per eye vertical resolution, which I think may be necessary to really bring the full image quality I'm looking for. While the 5k+ Was good for the 20 or so minutes, it was good, but after thinking about all the flaws, I couldn't recommend it. All I can hope is that eventually they will be good, but for now, IMO, stay away, if you aren't a tinkering type, just go to your local big box store that sells electronics (you know, the blue and yellow one...) and pick up a Rift. If you are on a budget, consider the Odyssey Plus, I believe the big box store has those, or at least you can order it to the store and have a return plan if it doesnt work out. If you have a beefy computer, the HP Reverb may be an option. Overall I'd say those 3 choices should leave you with alternatives over the Pimax.

After doing months of research, I pulled the trigger and ordered the Pimax 5K Plus Headset.  Sure there were reviews that had some identified issues in the past, but as this company was getting products to market for some time, my bet was that they were mostly ironed out!The first headset arrived, and unfortunately the lenses were defective with large sections having abrasions.  From what was visible and not obscured however - I was speachless!  So I contacted support, and quickly had a return started through Amazon - absolutely no hassles!I ordered a second one, and it was perfect!  The visual quality and field of view are second to none in my opinion, and after getting it set up and playing some DCS and P3D Flight Sims, I was astounded by the rendering quality, and seamless movements while looking around.Pimax wasn't done with me though!  They followed up to ensure that I was happy with the second headset, apologizing for the first mishap, and even provided compensation for the extra shipping I incurred shipping back the first one.All in all, a great headset, and fantastic support from a great company!!

I ordered the Pimax to replace an Oculus Rift S. I like my Rift S and feel that $400 it is an excellent value. I had the HTC Vive (for about a week before I retuned it).  I primarily fly the sim and race in Project Cars 2 in VR. The Pimax on paper is ideal for these two things in VR. I watched all the reviews and finally decided to pull the trigger during the Prime Days Sale.Right away I had issues installing the Pi Tool software. It would install, but was buggy and unreadable. It had some sort of weird transparency. After 4 hours of uninstalling other programs and fiddling around with it, I installed it on my son's laptop and it started right up without issue. I really wanted the Pimax to work, so I reset my Windows 10 install and started from scratch. Yes it was a pain, but my computer needed it anyway as I had 3 years worth of programs and files that I didnt need anyway. I will also say that the Pimax support team did reach out to me same day on Reddit after I posted that I was having issues.After Pitool got up and running, the Pimax was pretty easy to use and set up. I have been tinkering with VR for the last 3 years though, so that maybe why I found it to be a relatively simple process. You will have to figure out Steam VR if you want to use the Pimax.The first thing I noticed once it was up and running is that the colors were very dull compared to the Rift S. Also, clarity in the image and especially text were just not as sharp. This is really noticeable in Xplane when you are trying to read gauges. I tweaked Pitool and SteamVR settings SS/Pitool SS to try to sharpen the image up, but it just didnt happen. My IPD is about 65. The IPD adjusmtent was nice with a digital readout of IPD when you adjust. I adjusted the contrast and brightness settings in Pitool to no avail. The image was still far better than the first gen headsets, but just not as sharp as the Rift S. This is surprising considering the Pimax has a much higher resolution than the S, albeit spread out over a much wider effective viewing surface.The FOV was nice, but something with the lense design made images in my peripheral have a magnifying glass effect. Project Cars 2 just made me feel sick with Pimax on. Although I will say it was wholly entertaining being able to see the cars in my peripheral while battling at Bathurst! I like where Pimax is going, but the lense design and optics needs some work.After watching many online reviews and Youtube videos about Pimax, I expected the build quality to be far worse than it was. It is hard plastic, but it felt sturdy and I quite like the volume and power buttons on the headset. The strap was nicer than I expected and the headset is surprisingly lightweight. I had no problem getting a comfortable fit. There is no built in audio, so I used by Bose QC35s, just I like I do on the Rift S. I have a Vive deluxe audio strap, but since I didnt keep the Pimax, I didn't have a chance to try that out with the Pimax as a $17 kit is needed to mod the PImax with the DAS.I like what Pimax is doing. This VR headset is very different from the Rift/Vive. The wide field of view is nice, but the optics need some work. At over $700 without any tracking or sound, the optics need to be on point. I think Pimax will get there and I am glad to see so many people online and in the reviews here enjoying the Pimax. The software was actually quite good and easy to use once I got it up and running. Hopefully the next generation of Pimax will bring VR to the next level with the wide field of view and better optics.

I really wanted this to be a great headset, but it fails in so many ways. Build quality is not great for a high priced unit. Comfort is sub par complete with a strap for the headset. No headphones. I knew this going in but when you are paying this much you have to be compared to the Index and the vive pro both come with headphones. The lenses and fov do not live up to the hype for me. Yes you have a wider field of view, but it isn't natural. It's more like fish eyes that distort at the edges. The colors are not vibrant especially when compared to the Index and Rift S. Throw in multiple crashes and games that just are not compatible and this unit is being sent back. If you want the best high end headset go for the Index. If you want the best mid range headset grab the Rift S. Unfortunately I don't see a profitable market for the Pimax 5k+

First my main objections should not reflect on the unit itself. As far as I can tell it appears to be a nice piece. My objections start with I specifically ask for a head set that would work with HDMI. There is nothing that says you must have a Playport. My Computer is a laptop and has all the minimum requirements outlined in the Specs except a Playport. I had to buy an adapter from Playport to HDMI. It does not work and I can not afford a new $2000 tower just to run this piece. I am not a gamer and wanted this because I had some surgery and expecting more. The privacy of the headset for reading, typing and watching movies would be a benefit for me and my family. I will be returning the unit.On the other hand it seams to be an impressive unit. Very impressive packaging. The instructions are somewhat difficult to follow.Too, start out with, If you have a gaming computer this might be a good value to look into.

Overall I've very happy with my Pimax 5K +, which I chose over the 8K due to sharpness, and chose over the 5K VR due to the reduced screen-door effect. With any HMD currently on the market there are compromises, so it's important to know what you want before you buy. My criteria were large FOV, sharp picture, and low-to-no screen-door effect. The 5K + has very good resolution, and extremely little screen-door effect (The screen-door effect is also so minimized that it's hard to tell that it's there at all.). It also supports 90hz refresh rates and the PiTool software's BrainWarp works just as well if not better than the other async rendering options I've seen. It also has a massive FOV - in Large FOV mode the ""screen"" fills your peripheral vision very close to 100%. You have to really strain to tell that you've lost any peripheral vision at all. It also supports two smaller FOV modes, either for better performance or for other specific reasons (for example, in Racing Sims, which I play a lot, the Normal FOV is almost exactly like having a helmet on in actual motorsports, so no need to bother with wide FOV in those titles). The downsides? Blacks are really a dark grey, and if you plan on running games in large FOV you have to render extremely high resolutions, so you'll need a pretty powerful rig to make the most out of the HMD (but you can always run one of the smaller FOVs and upgrade your rig later). So all in all this HMD supports the features I wanted. If you are more sensitive to grey-not-blacks and less botherer by the screen-door effect you might look at the 5K XR model instead.

Presumably the product is fine, if you receive one that is working. (I'd be interested in that probability if anyone knows.)Unfortunately, I had a hardware issue with the headset where the lower half of the left display was discolored and would drop pixels or show them as a primary color that was glaring. If you don't spend hours a day in VR, then fyi if one eye is malfunctioning its distracting and annoying at least, but at times nauseating. It worked pretty good other than that. Except I had an issue with beat saber not respecting my head position. This was almost certainly software related, I never got far enough to fix this beat saber bug due to the hardware issues.After about a month of somewhat stressful (hilarious in hind sight) interactions with numerous customer service representatives I was issued a RMA. If there is a hardware issue, Pimax can really only communicate one message a day, unless you are willing to switch to China's timezone.  Also, at first, the tech support would show up in my e-mail, but if I responded by e-mail the message was not delivered, I had to use the support forum, this furthered the delay. I believe this issue has been fixed and an e-mail reply will reach tech support at this time.Communication was difficult in general, and due to the slow pace of interactions it took a month for something that should have taken a few days maybe a week. Then when they gave me the return label, it was wrong, the destination was my house, at this point it was over a month from the purchase.I had gotten in the habit of calling Amazon support first and then conference with Pimax and Amazon support. This tended to help communications and it was the 4th time I had contacted Amazon support to help with Pimax support. This time around the Amazon representative allowed a refund prior to conferencing with Pimax. Its not clear how Amazon allowed this, the first 3 times Amazon insisted that I go through Pimax, which I was fine with at first. Maybe if enough grief is experienced by the customer Amazon will let you go through them? Whatever the case,  I jumped at the opportunity because the progress with Pimax was excruciatingly slow, and showed no sign of improving.In theory, I really like the idea of a independent high tech VR company, and I would really like to see a company like this succeed. I don't especially like giving a bad review, but I paid a bunch for this headset and I expect it to work as advertised, when it didn't work correctly the path was long a narrow.If I got a TV and 1/4 of the pixels were bad and would display bad colors and dropped pixels, I would hope the return process wouldn't take longer than a month. It was over a month and I hadn't even shipped it back yet. Who knows how long the total process would take, and if it would have gone smoothly. With so many goofball mistakes its hard for me to believe that none of them were on purpose, this would allow them to draw out the time of the return improving the bottom line. This is purely speculation on my part, maybe the support staff is just really bad at their jobs.Supporting Pimax seemed fine at first, but I'd rather not subsidize them. Good thing I bought it through Amazon despite the sharp price difference from the Pimax website. It might make you wonder, why is Amazon priced so much higher? I know why.

I bought the Pimax5K to replace an Oculus Rift nearly a year ago and only after I had tested th upgraded Oculus & several other new VR headsets just coming on the market at the time. I was impressed by the Pimax claims of lowered Screen Door Effect (SDE) and a wider field of view,which when properly adjusted it delivers. I bought the Pimax through a special offer on Amazon and after some delay it arrived.It came in an impressive box, but without the scanner box(s) necessary to make in a completely serviceable VR utility, at the time Pimax did not offer their own but I was able to order one of them that would work for about $100.00. I was also unhappy with the headstraps that were supposed to hold the headset in place ...they did not do the job with this headset & its weight and did not have built in headphones . After the very comfortable Oculus Rift that came complete with a very comfortable headstraps & headphone set the Pimax which cost considerably more,this was very disappointing.Fortunately there was an online recommendation to get a replacement headset from another VR company that with a homemade conversion and additional facial cushions that made a much better “fit” than the single cushion that came with Pimax.This new ( but used ) headstrap & new cushions cost an additional $125.00 or so. The money I had saved in the special price from Amazon was sadly negated by these necessary additional items. I play IL-2Great Battles series almost exclusively and that’s what I bought the Pimax for. I am fortunate that the Forum for the sim had a VR section with all sorts of advice for the various VR sets ,including Pimax 5K ( which has a lot of support there by the way.)Obviously the best advice I got was to download the newest Pitool from Pimax and to adjust it for the afore mentioned flight sim.I also got suggested in game settings that would help in clarity & performance . I found it good to write these down, because upgrades in Windows ,in IL-2 , Pitool, and other unknowns tend to throw settings out the window from time to time...maddening but manageable.  So after a year of use I have to say I’m happy with the results and generally with Pimax support as well.when is is all lined up & on the beam it is simply wonderful and I’m keeping the 5K for a while. The SDE is still with me but it is much reduced from Oculus products .Through the Pitool I can play with field of view, but mostly keep it on “Normal” which is acceptable. Fit & comfort are still problematic, but again manageable at least for periods of less than an hour or so. Pimax now offers much more in accessories than it did a year ago for its newest generation of VR but at a cost...also the newest generation requires a very pricey graphics card the 2080 from Nvidia. This would require about $2000.00 or so which is very dear after spending about $900.00 less than a year ago,so I’ll be keeping my 5K for a while longer before getting the newest Pimax ( which I very much want) but at the same time saving my pennies & as always keeping an eye out for what the other VR guys come up with....

Coming from Oculus Rift, Pimax 5K+ is simply way better in every segment. The FOV, I would just say it feels so NATURAL. I do sim racing mostly, and it's basically the same FOV you get from wearing a helmet, no more need to turn your head to see the opponents. As to arcade games like Fruit Ninja VR, now you can see every single fruit, which is simply amazing. You do feel the higher resolution and crisper image, but I'd like to confirm that you can see SDE. It's not a deal breaker for me, as I basically forget it once I start playing. Comfort-wise, I recommend getting a Vive Deluxe Audio Strap and some 3D-printed adapters. And it does make the headset much more comfortable than Oculus Rift. Tracking-wise, 5K+ works perfectly fine with Vive base stations and controllers. All in all, it's just the best VR experience you can get at this moment.

My opinion on the Pimax 5k plus, like simracer I wanted a better image quality,but having a ipd of 70 the choice became limited for me,and after reading several reviews I decided to try the pimax 5k ... and I was dazzled by the angle of view!I did not think that the vision of pimax was so great!as much on the height as on the width, it is really incredible on iRacing, impressive by the sharpness of the headset, but the angle of view is what differentiates this helmet from all the others!For the first time I really feel like I'm in a car, I can get even better the apex and I was even surprised to see the vibrators on the sides of me,and I do not even talk about the sensation of speed that I can perceive now,never again I could go back with the close vision of other helmets, I also fly on DCS world and on iL-2 with the same pleasure!For the comfort it can be difficult to give an objective opinion because… no one has the same physiognomy,but I would say that it is the weak point of the helmet but it will have a new system which seems really comfortable that the velcro straps and I can not wait to get my hands on it eventually,but I do not want to talk about it anymore because there is already a lot of review on the net on the subject,I just want to share with you that if you are a simracers or Whether you are flying aficionados or no more immersive helmet than pimax!

I have always been enamored with flight sims even as a kid. I had dreams of one day earning my wings and becoming a pilot but as luck would have it, life tends to happen. So fast forward to the present time. I had come across some hyper realistic flight sim and I thought playing it in VR would be an absolute blast. Finally came across Pimax as it was being released. Took the plunge and got myself the 5K plus. I built a PC to specifically run flight sims in VR. VR in general puts a lot more stress on your rig.  And this was no exception.  If your not a tinkerer or someone who wants a plug and play system, this is not for you.  There are other options out there that will save you from long nights of pulling hair.  I happen to like doing it so I didn't mind. I knew what I was getting into knowing the final results, once everything is dialed in, would be worth all the headache and heartache.  I'm sure a lot of people are wondering about the SDE (screen door effect) on this model.... I'm glad to say that it's not an issue at all! It's there, but if you don't look for it, you can't even see it.  The FOV on this thing is downright amazing. It really immerses you into a different world.  I'm not going into the settings but you can change the FOV to whatever suits you.Now onto the few things I didn't like about the 5K plus.  It shipped with some flimsy headstraps that were utterly uncomfortable. I had to purchase a Vive Deluxe Audio Strap and a DAS adapter to get it to fit into the headset. The result was a very comfortable headset I can use for hours without feeling fatigued.  Another thing I didn't like was that you can't wear your glasses when you put this thing on because the fresnel lens will sit very close to your face. Recently though, Pimax released a comfort kit that essentially will position the headset further back away from your face and will be more comfortable to wear.  I ordered a comfort kit and I'm still awaiting for the shipment to come in.  Also, the earlier versions of Pimax headsets are notorious for their VERY thin housing cracking. As a result, Pimax have taken care of this issue by coming out with better quality housing. For me, I'm one of the unfortunate ones that bought the earlier generation. I have yet to see any cracking but, then again, I have only started using it two weeks ago.  Pimax has some protective cover to maybe help out early adopters. I'm still waiting for mine to come in. Pimax had sent me an email and said they will send one out for me as a Christmas present. Still waiting on that.Everything else considered, this thing is awesome! It's very temperamental but if you're patient enough, it'll reward you with some fantastic visual. I will be getting the new 8K X once it becomes available and use this unit as backup or get my son into flight sims

The headset itself is superior to any headset on the market, GIVEN these specific reasons: Field of view, clarity, and customization. I am a enthusiast and I want the best for a more immersive experience. Playing any competitive game in this HMD is basically cheating. Imagine playing a desktop game and the field of view is locked to 60 and resolution is 720p for everyone else. However when you play, you have 120 fov set and a res of 1080p. Your situational awareness is doubled, and your view distance is superior to everyone else. If you dont have steam VR equipment, this headset can also be used as a seated 3dof HMD. So if you are a racing/flight sim fan, I have no doubt in my mind that this HMD will enhance your experience.  Now lets talk about the downsides; At this given moment, the headset has no full package to purchase. So if you don't currently own any steam VR equipment with a delux audio strap then you will have to buy them separately. At the time of this review, the delux audio straps are STUPID expensive right now. I bought mine previously for 75$ (ebay)but now they are double even triple the price. The current strap that comes with the headset is subpar.  So given that information, if you have a steam VR setup with Vive/Valve equipment AND/OR a extra delux audio strap then I highly recommend this headset.

When I started using virtual reality, I started with a cardboard-like headset. I've been slowly upgrading my hardware over the past four years and got an HTC Vive. My next upgrade was a Pimax 5K+. Hands down the best VR decision I have made to date. The FOV on this thing is absolutely stunning, the screen-door effect is nearly gone, and the resolution is incredible. This headset I would argue is an amazing upgrade from the Vive or Rift and is worth every penny.There are a few cons, though:There is a small point in which you have to focus to get the clearest viewThere is some distortion on the outer edges of the headsetYou need at least a GTX 1070 to run this thing to its full potential (it's possible with older graphics cards, but the result isn't optimal)I don't see having to use their software as a con as it's so simple to use, but they do need to have it auto-launch SteamVR when the GUI is opened (or at least have that as an option)Whether you're a gamer or like a nice view of the earth from space, this headset is for you. I've tried their newer headsets, and they are even more amazing, but I still recommend this one over the Valve Index by a long shot, now that it also supports 120Hz at a slightly lower field of view. I look forward to buying more Pimax headsets in the future.

Best Upgrade I've Ever Made

Amending a previous review, while I still maintain that this is the best headset on the market right now, this unit shipped to me with bad firmware and i had to spend several hours on a teamviewer session to the hong kong team. Eventually, it was resolved and all was good.A few weeks ago, the 120hz mode was introduced and the software update forced a firmware update which wouldn't finish after several attempts. Then once it finally succeeded, I was faced with the same firmware issue I had when I received the headset. One support ticket and a trip to their forums/discord later, I learned that they currently have thousands of active tickets because of all the money wrangling they're trying to get out of their kickstarter backers, which means I may not get support for a very long time whereas I could have just bought an Index full kit for slightly more and had a much more complete experience with less issues.The headstrap and face foam that come with the headset are terrible and need to be replaced immediately. Vive foams work but they're still not that comfortable. Pimax themselves are admitting this by selling new comfort foams and headstraps (which are being delayed to oblivion). The resolution and FoV are great, but unless you have a 2080/2080ti, you won't get any useable framerates unless it's a minimalistic app. Also beware that apps may need ""parallel projections"" to be on, which immediately hurt your framerate just so the visuals are displayed properly. The 120hz mode is also restricted to small FoV which is exactly the same FoV as the Index.I used to think the FoV would be the biggest game changer for VR but the amount of tweaking, workarounds, and things that just plain don't work outside of small FoV, the Index is the much better option. I even found myself using the small FoV on apps where I'd normally use wide because I wanted to prioritize framerate and there's no video card on the market that can get this headset to 90hz at the wide FoV in a simulator or visually demanding app.

I've enjoyed the Oculus for a while but couldn't get past the feeling of looking at the world through goggles. Was very distracting. The Pimax eliminates that feeling for me with its much wider field of view. It's actually pretty fantastic. There is still a little screen door effect but not too bad. The headset is extremely light and comfy to wear. You are only getting the headset, no controllers or base stations. However, it works seamlessly with Steam and you can buy whatever controllers/lighthouses are compatible with Steam. For the price, I wish it had come with more than just the headset, maybe a Steam coupon or giftcard that I could use toward the other needed hardware. At any rate, I am extremely happy with my purchase. If you crave a wider FOV, try this out.  Also, setup was a breeze. Looking forward to more from Pimax.

A Huge FOV
"

FOV was nice but resolution was spread over the larger area not making any improvement on the current poor quality VR imaging headsets. The headband was very cheaply made. Several of the Velcro keepers came unglued / unattached on their first use. No way the double $$$ is justified over the Oculus S. With my oculus, I don't need an external device to provide VR location / sync. PIMAX software was troublesome to get working and not intuitive.

As an avid flight sim fan, I doubted that VR had come along as far as the reviews I had read were boasting, so I took a leap of faith and dived into the VR fray with my purchase of the PIMAX 5K Plus.  All I can say is...  ONCE YOU DIVE IN, THERE IS NO TURNING BACK!After you experience the immersion of sitting in the cockpit, you can't help but keep pushing your experience to its furthest potential by upgrading your HMD with the HTC Vive Deluxe Audio Strap.  If you've been on the fence about making the leap, all I can say is - you won't be disappointed!

It a little expensive but it worked with my existing Vive lanterns and controllers so I only had to buy the headset.  Compared to my Vive the resolution was better and the screen door effect is substantially less.  You don't feel like you're in a scuba mask due to a very wide field of view.  Most of my existing steam VR games worked right away, other's required some configuration of the Pimax software.This headset is well worth it if you love VR like I do.

difficult pictures to document... but you can see the startup screen has a refracted looking dark line in it... and the steamvr startup screen is a bit easier to see as it has the refraction easier to see in the wood flooring. again it isnt easy to snap a photo with my phone... good news. I had a replacement on the way (by amazon) before i could finish this comment... so upgraded from 1 to 3

Ultimate VR headset, wide field of view is very important for immersion and sense of speed I'm using VR mostly for flight simulators I previously had  Oculus Rift CV1 and this one is by far a game-changer. A must-have for racing or flight simulation. I will update the comfort rating after I get the improved Pimax VR Comfort Kit.

Would turn on, I'd see the screen for a few seconds then it would go blank. It's own software couldn't detect it even when it was plugged in properly. IMPORTANT when installing software it tells you to disable antivirus. I didn't test this out, it is sketchy AF, I don't trust anything that tells you to disable antivirus for installing.

This Pimax VR headset is NOT usable without any controllers. Why does Amazon offer this HID device w/o any controller. I had to send it back. Even it works and looks nice - it is NOT usable at all.And there is no way to order controllers (and the Lighthouse) separately. The Pimax VR headset does not have any value if it is not usable at the end.I am sending back this order.

As already stated, this headset is mostly awesome.+ Very large FOV+ Pixel density is quite good+ 120Hz is also nice to have- For me, very uncomfortable without mods (still waiting on my Vive Deluxe Audio Strap adapters)- I have a low IPD, and the adjustment doesn't go low enough for me...- Didn't work with Windows 7, had to upgrade to Windows 10(- Large FOV + High resolution = needs a lot of gpu power to work well)
