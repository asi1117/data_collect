Despite having the most accurate tracking and best visuals of any VR device on the market, the Vive Pro 2 is horribly fragile and unwieldy, in terms of weight, sheer number of cables and extra devices, and setup.The base stations provide slightly better tracking, at the expense of two extra power plugins and clever placement that secures them from physical bumps.  The headset itself has a proxy station, which needs *yet another* power plug, and requires the typical USB + display plugin to the computer, which it combines into a proprietary cord to the HMD.  This cord is unusually heavyweight, which is actually a problem in VR, because you can feel it, and are likely to trip on it, as it snakes around on the ground around you.  It you step on it too much, you can't simply run out to the store and replace it, because it's proprietary!I can't recommend this headset, in lieu of owning a Samsung Odyssey.  The Odyssey is just plain superior, even if the resolution is only 1440p per eye, rather than 2448p.  If you can find an Odyssey+, or a HP Reverb G2 HMD (which is 2160p per eye, but none of the extra device nonsense), you'll be doing yourself a big favor -- the extra rez of the Vive Pro 2 just isn't worth *that* much trouble.

3 external plugs, and a proxy box...  Windows MR devices have none, and have nearly as good visuals

This is the first review I have ever written on Amazon after purchasing probably hundreds of products. I truly hope it will help others.I am an experienced VR user, having bought the Oculus Rift shortly after its introduction in 2016 and moved up to the Rift S in 2019. I almost exclusively use VR for auto racing and flight sims. My computer is an i9-7980XE with an Nvidia GTX 2080ti, which should be able to exploit the capabilities of just about any VR rig.With its superior resolution, I thought I would try to step up to the Vive Pro 2. I read at least 100 reviews before taking the plunge. I was very disappointed. The improved resolution reduces the ""screen door effect"" somewhat, but in terms of overall image and clarity, the Vive Pro 2 was no better than my Rift S (which I do super sample at 1.7). The focal ""sweet spot"" seemed smaller and the clarity of the image at a distance (crucial for racing and flight sims) actually seemed somewhat worse.The Pro 2 is indeed expensive. I found it heavier and less comfortable than the Rift S and, of course, it requires base stations, which the Oculus does not.I have returned the Vive Pro 2. It may be a good unit for uses other than racing or flight sims. Those who are buying for the first time may want to consider the Oculus Quest2 or HP Reverb G2.  Generally though, it seems that those of us who wish to upgrade should wait for the next generation of headsets, hopefully with better lenses than the Fresnel lenses still used in the Vive Pro 2.

Not worth the money

Only works with Windows so we bought a new laptop for it.  Took forever to down load games then didn’t work as well as the other less expensive brand  that we played with.  Sadly returned…

Did not perform like it was supposed too. I set everything up exactly they way it needed it to be, but still didn't work properly. I've tried multiple times and eventually gave up. The visuals aren't that good and you have less field of view than the quest 2. It doesn't even function right with vrchat. For the amount that I paid I expected alot better, a whole lot better. I'm very disappointed and extremely upset about this product.

I was skeptical about purchasing this unit , but once I got it setup ( took awhile ) I realized , typical video games , are the past . This felt like I was in ready player one , the graphics aren’t 100% there yet but the immersion , is quite amazing . You may get some motion sickness , but once your in for an extended period of time , it does seem as if the reality projected to you , is the one you exist in . I am extremely looking forward to the next stage of development of these VR products .

Pros: step by step instructions on how to set it upOnce up and running it’s great visuals and lots of funCons: the software is pretty awful at times ( from the initial setup to mark your area of play to the dashboard which will disappear and you have to YouTube a video on how to bring it back there are just better program alternatives out there to replace to inferior software that comes with this VR systemThe controls are funky, especially when playing valves half life Alyx and The Lab on steam, they feel outdatedNo wireless, seems outdated, I understand why but also the cables didn’t seem to be long enough either at least from a moving vr experience.Overall the great gameplay experience is overshadowed by the already outdated physical limitationsIt’s not worth it for what is being spent on this if you ask my opinion

With Varjo Aero released for sale now, Fresnel lenses the HTC vive use are outdated, and just look terrible. Save yourself the trouble and buy a Varjo Aero, it’s worth the extra price. You will need steam base stations and steam controllers with the Varjo sold separately!!!

The cable was broken out of the box and I cannot find anywhere to buy a replacement cable. I had to settle with buying the expensive $300 wireless adapter to be able to play.

I got this while my brother got the Valve Index and I couldn’t be happier. Runs well and the controllers are very intuitive. 5 stars since it did everything I asked of it

Pretty useless without being wireless and the wireless adapter is also useless as you are constrained to the same room as a computer.
