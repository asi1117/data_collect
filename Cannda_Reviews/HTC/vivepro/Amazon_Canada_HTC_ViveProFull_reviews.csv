The good:VR games are fun! Beatport has been a blast, Subnautica has a been a bunch of fun as a VR port, my wife is loving moss.The Bad:All told it took ~5 hours of game play for one of the base stations (the little cubes that read your position in the room) to stop working. It just sits there with a blinking red light. Support tells me this is a hardware problem, and that to get it fixed I'll need to ship it back to them at my expense, wait about a month, then they'll hopefully ship a working unit back to me. I guess we're not doing any room-scale VR this month.At this price point I expected HTC to offer an advance shipment swap. One of those deals where they ship you a new working unit and you return the non-functional one in the same box promptly or they charge your credit card. But that's not something they will offer.Conclusion:I wont buy from HTC again.

I made the mistake of not immediately returning the system when i was having repeated tracking issues way back when i ordered it, and now im basically out the 2000 dollars this system costs because the support team doesn't listen and just has me reset my drivers over and over and over. If you get this headset and have any sort of tracking issues or controllers disconnecting, send it in for repair or refund immediately, before you get stuck with a fancy blue paperweight.

I have ordered the VR headset from Amazon Warehouse Deals and the headset is just dead not working at all. There is a big sticker on the box stating that this is a TESTED DEVICE FROM AMAZON and guest what it's not working. There was also a big sticker on the Headset from the previous owner ( West River School something like that) so that mean that the headset was probaly used by many many people before sent back to Amazon. You should definitely be very cautious when buying Amazon Warehouse Deals because it's cleared that those are customer returns NOT TESTED and CAREFULLY CLEANED.

Not Plug n Play for MacOS Mojave. Which had been announced by Apple 2018. HTC also walked away from their opportunity with Apple firmly stated NO MAC/APPLE Support from HTC Online/Call Centre. This was not communicated to Apple Support or Retail employees which was a vicious circle of HW & SW and two manufacturers pointing fingers to one another and driving hopefully  VR Mac users away.For Apple I am going to say I have had it and will be buying a PC and Mid-Advanced level HUD and equipment...Occulu? Perhaps Apple will release their own and put these barely 1.5/2gen VR solutions to shame.One thing I think Apple & HTC also smeared the YouTube/Googles algorithms because barely any other HTC VR / Apple / Steam users comments exist post Fall 2018 search results...Definitely not a good hobby for early adopters...

I bought the bundle HTC Vive Pro and found it easy to install and great to watch/play.  The graphics quality is very good and, with Steam, the number of games/programs available is ever increasing.  I'm very happy with my purchase.  However, I find that it's very expensive to upgrade it to become wireless.

I own both the HTC Vive original model and the Vive Pro.  You're reading this because you're trying to figure out which one to buy - the Vive original that's just over $400 or the Pro which is .. a lot more.Short version - if you're new to VR and you're worried the Vive Original isn't good enough - it is.  At $400+ it's a steal. You get so much value for what's an introduction price to typical consoles that you really can't go wrong.  If you're waffling on your decision, go with the Original and you'll be a happy camper.For those of you, like me, who are constantly asking ""But what if this 'Pro' model is so much better?"".  It's nice - it's just not ""Holy cow I'm so happy I blew my paycheck"" nice.Undoubtedly you've read the professional reviews so here's the non-professional review - the kind of advice you wished your best friend would just give you.  They did everything right with this headset.  It's more comfortable, the resolution chops down on the ""screen door effect"" that the pixelated original feels like, and it just feels like a more polished experience overall.  Even the remote camera sensors are a bit sleeker.The problem with this generation of VR is just that they can't deliver a ""retina like"" experience anywhere close to the price point consumers are willing to pay.  So while the Vive Pro is better, we're still 2-3 years away from getting an experience that doesn't feel compromised.You're still dealing with the issue of having to look dead straight to get the picture to resolve correctly.  You can still see pixels, albeit fewer.  The headset is still a bit wonky and heavy.  It's still Gen 1 VR.  Think of this as the Iphone S model upgrade where it's a bit better, but you're still a generation behind.So I'd leave the decision tree like this -1.  Just testing VR and want to see if it's legit?  Buy the Original2.  Totally enamored with VR and can appreciate a subtle improvement.  Buy the Pro.VR is amazing - and I say that as a total cynic. Even though there are only a handful of games out they are so immersive that it doesn't matter.  Don't think of it like playing console or PC games.  In this cases while the graphics are always getting better, the experience is the same.  In the case of VR, even games I've played an unreasonable amount of hours on (like Fallout 4) on my PC feel like entirely new experiences.One last caution - VR lasts maybe an hour at a time.  After that, it gives you a bit of a headache.  It sucks because you want the experience to keep going, but putting blinding screens an inch+ from your eyes for any period of time is gonna add up.  Think of it more like a ride at a theme park than an all-night couch dwelling console session.

The Second Best Decision You Could Make
"
2022-05-23 10:19:44.899476,"
I own the original VIVE headset since it debuted a couple of years ago. I decided to buy the PRO version for business, because of all the positive reviews about its reliability and increased resolution.Set-up: overall, it was pretty bad. I've read the stories about the long setup process that the PRO headset requires. I chose not to believe them, because I thought of myself as a pretty experienced person with VR. After all, I have the original VIVE and know how to deal with software updates and troubleshoot issues.Well, friends, I was wrong. At first everything was fine, as the little program that I downloaded from the HTC website was guiding me through the process. Then I was asked to sign in with the HTC account, so that I can ""enjoy"" my several months of free membership of their VR store. I googled around, and there was no way of continuing the installation of the headset without the HTC account. DEAR HTC, please don't drag me into your store if I am not interested. As a customer, I don't appreciate the strong-arming. I don't need another store subscription. I know what you are thinking: ""he bought the headset, he has the installation running = he is invested deep enough now that he will register for the store account, even if he doesn't really want it."" Nice calculus, but I am no longer a happy customer of yours after this kind of treatment.Long story short, I did register for the HTC account; I singed in with my Steam account. Moving on, the HTC install program did not recognize my USB 3 port as USB 3, no matter how I tried. USB 3 is required for optimum performance of the two cameras on the headset. That's fine, I thought, let's just skip this step. Then the installation program proceeded to download a whole bunch of stuff, including their store program which I did not really need, all in excess of 1 gig.  At this point, I felt the process was becoming too involving. I was asked then to update all the software in the headset itself and the controllers. When all was done, at the end of the installation, I began receiving error messages from HTC software trying to sort things out with the Steam store and Steam VR. It was confusing and annoying, like watching two stores - HTC and STEAM -  fight it out on my desktop. I also downloaded the latest NVIDIA drivers (I run a 1080 card), and updated windows as well.Actual Use:I installed the lighthouses in the same spots where I had the original VIVE lighthouses installed. These things were supposed to be better, so I was pretty excited. Set up Room Scale VR as usual, set AUDIO in Steam VR to HMD, put on the headset and... the word to describe how I felt is ""underwhelming."" Many reviews say the screen door effect is ""almost gone"", ""barely visible"", or even ""totally solved."" I don't know how much these websites depend on advertising revenue from Steam or HTC, but the screen door effect is - clearly, 100%, in-your-face - there. I wasn't trying to look for it, I just wanted to focus on the image, but the screen door effect was photo-bombing everything just like it does in the original VIVE that was made 2 years ago.Yes, the headset is more comfortable than the original! And like most reviewers claim, it is a big deal. This is the only positive thing that I can say about the headset.Performance: With my 1080 card, I did not notice any jitter or frame drops. However, I had a lot of tracking issues where the floor would start flying from underneath me, or I would be pushed into the wall in the VR. I did room set up many many many times, and I adjusted the lighthouses many many many many times, trying all possible angles. I troubleshoot the headset for defective hardware, all was good. Did the setups again, and again received tracking madness. I switched back My original VIVE, and everything worked rock-solid. Then I did some googling, and it is a known issue. It seems, this new VIVE PRO is super-susceptible to issues if there are reflective surfaces nearby. I have several windows in my VR area that I suspect were causing the problem. However, my original VIVE has zero issues with those windows. I thought the VIVE PRO is supposed to be BETTER, right? I mean, more reliable? What's up with this, HTC? How come my original VIVE performs better than your newest PRO version? I bought this for business, I don't have time tinkering with it all the time. My original VIVE seems to be more PRO reliable than this newest, super-expensive, ""PRO"" version.In the end, I decided to return VIVE PRO, because it feels like a step backward to me. Even the plastic looks cheap compared to the original version. Same with presentation - the box is horrible. Seems like HTC just doesn't care as much as they cared when they released the original headset. It feels like they were trying to cut costs with this (and charge an arm and a leg at the same time, to make it a winning business strategy).Here's my recommendation:- if you have the original VIVE, buy a strap with built-in headphones, and your VIVE will be as comfortable as the new one. The resolution bump sounds impressive on paper, but in real life, you will -barely- notice it. Barely. Wait until HTC gets it game together and produces a truly next generation VR headset. This VIVE PRO is a scam.- if you don't have any VR headset and want one now; buy the original VIVE if you want superior tracking, plus the wireless add-on, plus the strap with built-in headphones. You will have a superior VR experience, AND save a ton of money that you can put towards the next generation VR when it comes out, spend on a Hawaiian vacation, invest in the stock market, or whatever you want to do with it. VIVE PRO is just too glitchy.Still feel like you want VIVE PRO? Then read all the horror stories on redit about people spending weeks and months trying to make the tracking work. Google ""VIVE Pro tracking issues"". Still want to buy it? I totally understand, why believe someone else's experience, when you can witness these problems first-hand? Go ahead and buy it. Amazon has a great return policy.To those of you who happen to have zero reflective surfaces in or near your VR area, and your PRO is working for you - good for you. I still don't understand how my original VIVE works so flawlessly in same area where this ""PRO"" version is a total puke-inciting mess. What's going on with you, HTC?

I am changing my review from a 5 star rating to a 1 star rating due to the terrible customer service that HTC offers.I have owned the Vive Pro a little over 6 months and the link box died 2 months ago. After calling Amazon, I was referred to HTC for warranty repair; no problem I thought. I created a ticket through their email system same-day the link box died.*****There is no Customer Support Phone Number and if you do try another HTC department thinking you can escalate, HTC still cannot help you***** It took over a week for someone from HTC to respond. After getting stuck into a month loop of questions and waiting days for a response, HTC finally agrees to exchange my link box. We'll it's been over 3 weeks since the agreement, and I still do no have a a tracking number or have received the new link box. I am also not getting a response on the emails asking if the device has shipped. Yes, this box is around 40-50 bucks, however it is the principle of the matter that the warranty department refuses to service the issue or care about their customers.When the Vive Pro works, it's solid and way better than anything I have tried on the market. I have a friend that has the Oculus and another that has a regular Vive. Both have purchased the Vive Pro after trying my Pro out. Now, I regret influencing them in-case their Pro has issue and they are ran through the nightmare I am going through.Take my comments as a grain of salt, however this is an expensive product and you would think HTC would care about their customers. Especially the early buyers. All I can say, buyer BEWARE!

This review is about how the product was shipped.  Unless I made a complete mistake I was buying a used very good condition.  I can live without the original packaging but as u can see from the picture they dumped the equipment loose in a box twice as large as need and put absolutely nothing in to protect it not even a air pillow.  Picture is from the moment I opened the box, the head set seems fine but the infrared modules are very scuffed up.  I'm.going to see if the scuffs effect anything and I need to take a close look at the lenses.  Right tnow I'm very un happy

Love the VR experience; play Beat Saber now!I held off until the second generation Vive came out thinking it would somehow be better and the kinks would be worked out. However, my nephew also purchased an Oculus Rift a week after I purchased the Vive Pro for 1/3 the price and there is no noticeable differences in game play.  SteamVR errors constantly pop up telling me programs are already running. Sensor setup is tricky to get right.My nephew plays games while I play around with setup. The Vive is still in development stages. Purchase it only if you like to fiddle around to get things to work.Update: After the first few weeks I started having serious tracking problems with the controllers and headset. Read many of the news groups and tried many of the fixes (reinstall, new USB port, disable camera tracking etc) but it still doesn't work. Tired to do a return for a refund but found out I was 5 days past the deadline. Really, really, wish I purchased an Oculus Rift and saved a bunch of headaches and money!

For over a year HTC had not been able to fix the most basic functionality of its VR set: the ability to indicate the charging status of its controllers. There are A LOT of complaints from people on HTC forums, with HTC only be able to say “Blame Valve’s Steam VR”. Well, I didn’t buy the set from Valve. I bought it from HTC, through Amazon. HTC is the manufacturer, HTC is the warranty provider, HTC is responsible for how the set operates.Besides that, the headset has basically no ventilation whatsoever. The lenses produce A LOT of glare, and compounded by lack of ventilation - they also fog up A LOT, making playing games in it a terrible experience.The controllers are very heavy and the shape is such that they just want to slip out of your hands. Playing, say, Beat Saber with these is a constant exercise in frustration. The VR controllers should not require you to constantly making sure you’re holding them very strongly.At this time, I think this kit is severely outdated and overpriced. If you want a good headset - look elsewhere. I’m personally looking forward to getting Valve Index.This HTC kit is worth half of the asking price at best.

I bought the HTC Vive Pro system for my son for his birthday.  I originally wanted to get him the older one since it was half the price, but most places were out of stock so he wouldn't have it in time for his birthday.  My nephew has the old system, so we have used it many times, so this review is my comparison from the Vive to the Vive Pro.  From the moment you open the box you can see there is a difference in the two systems.  The Vive Pro has been colored blue which I can only guess is to make it look different enough from the original system to make people want to buy it?  The setup is exactly the same for both systems.  They make a very complex system easy to set up by numbering each box.  By going in order opening each box, its pretty much fool proof.  I would warn everyone to make sure before you setup this unit, go into Device Manager in Windows and verify that all your drivers are installed and working (If you see a red x or a yellow exclamation mark, fix this before installing the Vive).  When I attempted to set this up on my son's computer, his USB 3.0 driver wasnt installed.  This caused a lot of issues.  Luckily I have been a computer engineer for almost 20 years, because I can't imagine how a non-technical person would have gotten around this.  The whole setup took about 2 hours to complete (that includes mounting the sensors and hiding the wires inside the walls.  Be sure before you begin to verify your computer far exceeds the minimum requirements.  When I was researching the difference between the Vive & the Vive Pro, they kept mentioning the higher graphics resolution, but I have to say, I don't see much of a difference in the 2 systems.  In fact, in my opinion, the only difference I see in the two systems is the color of the headset and controller and an upgrade in how the headset is constructed.  Knowing what I know now, if presented the opportunity to choose between the Vive and the Vive Pro, I don't think paying the extra money was worth it.  I paid almost $1,500 total (tax included) for the system, whereas you can get the old Vive system for around $800.  I personally don't see enough of a difference in the two systems to warrant that kind of price jump.  I will say that this system is like nothing you have ever seen before.  The VR is so realistic you actually feel like you are somewhere else.  Between the lifelike graphics and the amazing accompanying audio, you will not believe just how realistic this system is.  If you look at the price without trying the system out, the price seems outrageous.  Once you try the VR for yourself, you totally understand why its so expensive.  If you have the money for one of these systems (either the original Vive or the Vive Pro) I recommended purchasing it.  You won't be disappointed.  The VR experience is like nothing you have ever experienced before.

HTC Vive Pro vs. the Original Vive -  My comparison

The ergonomics, link box, cabling, and resolution are great. But the lenses are subpar and are now the worst part of the visuals. The lenses create banding, blur around the periphery, and god rays. I can't wait until I can get aftermarket lenses for this thing to replace them.You also can't change the brightness on the headset except to ""night mode"". I would like something in between. The default brightness is too bright, especially with the god ray problem this thing has. Currently, I just stay in night mode always, but I have to set it by hand every day.The controllers have side buttons that are too easy to press. In games such as shooty-fruity, I constantly press the side buttons accidentally while pulling the trigger. Pressing the side button results in dropping the gun, which is really frustrating. The controllers also still use micro USB for some reason. $120 each seems like too much for these things.Expect to buy your own longer Displayport->minidisplayport and USB Male-to-Male cords unless your play area is directly against the back of your PC.The tracking is usually pretty good, but I had to remove some glass from the play area. Even now, every hour or so there's some kind of blip. What I don't understand is why this can't be detected. Why can't gameplay can't pause and why can't the headset can't go dark when it believes my headset literally teleported under the floor or shot 5 feet to the upper left at 400 mph? The game just keeps going and punishes you while you get a headache.These faults are small enough that 5 stars would be possible if the system were $800 or less, but at $1300, it needs to be better.

I'm running the Pro with wireless kit, and have my base stations on a pole and basically they NEVER get moved, touched, hit etc. After a few months, a base station will 'die', which is indicated by a blinking red light. It is a hardware failure, and online vive support says send it in. Apparently, there numerous reports that sending it in is a dead end.

The company does not support the USA. They offer other countries things that we are unable to get, and when we have trouble, they say we have to pay to play. The customer support is in Columbia, the country. They just keep reading off the script that they were given. The Vive Pro is a bad investment. HTC does not make good phones either. I suggest you find a product that you can actually use instead of constantly having to repair it.

At first I had buyers remorse because I spent nearly 2k on this vr setup (not including the computer). I also got the wireless adaptor for this headset and it hooked up easily. The instructions are so ""simple"" that I almost couldn't figure them out. After about an hour of setting everything up. I ended up with the trackers being on opposite sides of my room. So that it could get a 360 coverage better. Also o e thing to note is that mirrors of any kind need to either be removed or covered with something because it causes the tracking to go nutz. I then got all my games from steam. And fired up there steam vr client app. Witch brings you to a room so you can pop in and out of any vr game. So far this headset has been perfect. I have almost 14 hours in it. Since I have the wireless setup, it needs a battery pack to power it. The one HTC provides is something around 20wh witch will not last for more than 3-4 hours of play time. I already have a 100wh battery bank but I soon realized it would not work because it doesn't have quick charger 3.0. For some reason qc 3.0 only works with the headset. I will update this review if anything comes up. So far it's been the best experience ever!

I kept going back and forth with my husband on which VR to get. We chose this one mostly because it was the only one available at the time, but also because we looked it up on YouTube and a lot of people were recommending it.It took a little longer than expected to receive this item, probably because of COVID-19. However, we received it still in reasonable timing, and we have no regrets. Yes, it's a little pricey.. especially when you can go get the Oculus or the PSVR for way less. But let me say this, you get what you pay for in VR. Meaning, the quality is so much better in the HTC Vive than the Oculus or PS VR. I can say this because I have both. The game options are endless on PC versus the PlayStation. The controllers on the HTC Vive are comfortable and very responsive. It comes with two base stations, and when you're setting up the VR it asks you to set boundaries. Basically what it wants you to do is to take a controller and walk around the room to let it know when to inform you that you're too close to something. So say you walk into a square, and you put the headset on... If you walk too close to your refrigerator, there will be a wall that shows up in the VR to let you know not to go past that point or you're going to run into something. Lol unfortunately, there's no way for it to know where the ceiling is so be careful on that. If you have the option, I recommend a room with high ceilings, as my husband has already destroyed a light fixture while playing Beatsaber. LolThe only complaint with the HTC Vive is when you want to add add-ons. That's when it becomes a little bit more tricky and frustrating. For example, the wireless option... The HTC Vive has the option for wireless play, by buying a wireless adapter and installing it. Which is actually rather easy to do. However, it doesn't work as expected. So if you're wanting this VR because of the wireless option, just know that it's not very solid. It is beneficial for some games to have wireless, but your sacrificing quality for it. The battery life on the wireless is awful, and it'll occasionally cut out in the middle of your game which will throw you off your balance when you're in the middle of a gunfight and the whole screen goes black. Lol So just keep that in mind when buying VR. If you're buying it for the accessories, definitely look up reviews on said accessories.Other than that, we are very pleased with our VR. As you all know, it is expensive. But I promise you, you're going to have a blast with it. Just make sure before buying it, that you're going to play it enough to be worth the money. The quality itself is worth the money, but what really makes it worth it is how much you use it. Don't buy VR if you're only going to play it a couple times. If that's the case, go to a friend's house who has one.Another thing that I would like to point out is the physical sensation of being in this VR. What I mean is, a lot of VRs, especially when they first came out... Had a bunch of warnings about possible seizures, and other things that could happen because of the VR. For example, losing your balance or getting lightheaded or motion sickness... It happens. But, this VR is by far the most comfortable one that I've worn, and the least likely one to get me sick or to throw me off balance. I have played this VR for about 45 minutes at a time, Max. And I have yet to have any issues with dizziness or nausea, seizures, whatever it is. Where I can't say the same thing about the PSVR or the Oculus. The PSVR, is notorious for making people dizzy and nauseous (motion sickness). Even if you're only playing it for 15 minutes. That is a huge difference in the two VRs. So definitely keep that in mind when you're trying to justify the cost. It's going to be much more comfortable, and you're going to last longer in VR than you would in a cheaper headset.One last thing that I would Life to point out is the quality of the speakers on the headset. Unlike the PSVR, the HTC Vive Pro has speakers built into the headset. You can either have them up and away from your ear so you can hear other people and the game, or you can have them against your ear so that all your hearing is the game. They can get very loud, and they're actually really good quality speakers. You don't need another headset while using this VR. Just use the headset that it comes with, because it's good enough.

I love VR, and this is the best headset you can get right now, but there are a few negatives I wish I'd known before I made the purchase.On the positive side, the video is definitely a noticeable upgrade over the regular Vive.  The audio is very good, and the headset is very comfortable.On the negative side, the cord is a different design, and is much more difficult to ""uncrimp"", if you play games that have you spinning a lot, the cord will likely become very damaged, need to be untangled more often than on the original Vive, and ""may"" break. (Mine hasn't broken yet, but it looks terrible and I'd imagine it's just a matter of time).The cord cannot be extended after the link box.  It's still long, but definitely a bit more limiting than the original Vive.  While there's a wireless setup, there's an add on required for the Pro that is currently back ordered for at least a month.The headset is also a bit more finicky than the original Vive when it comes to SteamVR.  There are apps that I cannot have open when I try and start SteamVR or it wont work, apps that I can have open with the original Vive (some common examples are Teamviewer, and f.lux), if I do forget to close one of these apps, I need to turn off the power on the Vive Pro link box, and turn it back on before SteamVR will work again.  Hopefully these issues will be fixed someday, but, it's been a problem for 6 months and they still haven't.The base stations have more of an issue with reflections than the original ones, picture frames or windows (even at night) will cause issues if not covered up.I use this headset every day, and I love it, but there's still a lot of work that needs done.

First month was great, even bought the wireless adapter because my friends and I were having so much fun. Turns out there is a bug with AMD CPUs where if u try to use VIVE wireless with a Ryzen it blue screens your PC. They promised a fix but I haven't been able to get it working 3 months later. On top of that the Lighthouse brokea week ago less than 4 months after purchase. Displays a blinking red light which means it needs to be sent back for repair. I had heard it can take upwards of 10 weeks to get anything fixed so I opened a support ticket a few days ago to see how to start the process. Still haven't even gotten an initial response.Love the headset, cannot recommend it to anyone in its current state.

After only a couple weeks, one of the 2.0 Base stations failed with a blinking red light. searching online it turned out that this was a very common issue that many people have. The only way to fix it was to send it in to be repaired.Talked to vive support and its an common issue with the motor. Have to send it in to be repaired.Vive support initially suggested I just return the entire vive pro and buy it again. I guess to hope I get one of the unbroken ones :( I don't want to pack everything up again.  Once I decide to get it fixed, the process was not actually that bad.  Lots of horror stories on the internet, but my repair process was not that bad.I got an HTC Support ticket and had to mail the defective lighthouse to texas ($12 out of my pocket). They say 9-12 days after hey get it they will ship it back.  Mine was repaired in under 2 weeks and has been shipped back to me. Its still in transit, but I have no reason to doubt it will actually be fixed.Support was really good via email. Responsive and polite. Good english, no form letters.I went from 2 to 4 stars.

Right out of the Box, one of the base stations was broken. Then, I signed up for the subscription service, $8.99 a month to play VR games, and was immediately billed TWICE and still couldn't download anything (just kept getting a popup to subscribe again). Steam VR games work somewhat well with this, but some don't work properly, such as Subnautica. I was expecting so much more after upgrading from the Oculus Rift but the Oculus at least worked properly for several years.

Got the pro set. Clearly depicted as wireless and states it uses HDMI.The thing comes with a wire, and uses a Displayport, not HDMI like they said, unlike other VIVEs.Upgraded my computer so I can use the damn thing, then it randomly stops working after a week. After hours of trouble shoot and reaching out I can't get any help at all.Complete waste, something I would have really loved but ended up costing me far more than a refund could ever reimburse in upgrades, software, and most importantly, my time.I would be interested to see how they intend to fix or compensate me.

So, I finally broke down and bought one of these. There are a lot of pros, the experience is good the sound is good everything is fantastic. My only complaint is if your eyes are not centered precisely when this is on it’s blurry. There are circles that start just outside of the center of the screen and if you’re moving around and the headset slides a little bit things become blurry. That’s frustrating because this thing is not cheap. I could’ve went with a cheaper version of the five or the oculus but believe VR is up-and-coming and an exploding platform. That said, if you’re going to spend the money by the best. So far no real complaints. I have the wireless battery pack and that is definitely not worth it. The pack only lasts about an hour and a half to two hours and there is no warning when it quits. There is only one wire that goes to the computer and quite frankly after playing several different types of games there was really no reason to have the battery pack. You don’t really move around all that much.

I got rid of my Oculus Rift to upgrade to this headset.I had no issue with the set-up mounting the 2 lighthouses at 180deg at 6'6"" off the floor. Set-up-smooth ran and caused me no problem. the only thing is they say in the instructions that the lighthouses lights should turn white. That is wrong, they should turn green if they are good.The headset is crisp and I can read text inside VR. Screen-dooring was a minimum and games, movies and even the desktop look fantastic.The built in speakers are crisp and clean, if a little light on the bass.Tracking is excellent and very precise, in a 9'X7' use area. They claim mm precision, and I have no reason to doubt that claim.My only issue and why I give it 4 stars is the controllers are really not good. Smooth-motion is a far cry from the Oculus touch. They are big and holding them really needs a bigger hand, I end up having to put my middle finger over the trigger to 'choke up' enough to use the track pads. The tack pads themselves are not very precise so in game movement can get all over the place, but with practice it does get better.  The good news is the =next gen controllers, the knuckles should be coming soon and I can get rid of these batons.

Credit where due: when it works, it's fun. Light years from a great VR experience, but I don't think a great VR experience exists in the world yet.My main complaint is that one of the base stations simply stopped working out of nowhere and HTC straight up won't sell replacements. They don't sell 2.0 base stations. At all. Like, what? How can you sell a product, especially one that breaks easier than an egg shell, and not sell any replacements whatsoever? The only options I have are 1) buying another full setup for a thousand dollars, 2) spending $300 to downgrade to two 1.0 base stations, or 3) mailing the broken base station to them and waiting for a month (yes they told me a month) to get it mailed back.Other complaints: - Only some types of games/experiences work if you're using the cable headset. The cable is annoying and honestly the Vive shouldn't even exist unless it's all wireless. They have a $300 wireless extension you can buy, which should be considered mandatory and therefore you can assume your system will cost an additional $300. - Still heavy and clunky feeling while wearing it. Far too heavy to be particularly agile, can twist around on your head fairly easily if you play a game that moves at all, mainly due to it being too heavy. - Exacerbated by the fact that it moves around on you head, the way the lenses work is godawful... you need to look directly into the center of the glass in order to not have your entire vision blurred, so when you try to look even slightly into your peripheral vision all you see is blurred nonsense. Kind of defeats the purpose of having a high definition display if your lens is obscuring the majority of those extra pixels you paid so much for... - SteamVR software that runs the whole show is buggy, slow, needs to be restarted frequently, and overall seems like it's the very first prototype that worked when the engineers were first experimenting with a VR system, rather than an actual product that is sold to customers. To add insult to injury, I have to look at big popup advertisements from Steam every time I start the SteamVR program, when all I want to do is turn on my VR system and use it. - Customer support is only available by online chat, not phone, which means responses are much slower and you typically just get generic responses that don't help solve anything. Personally I actually think it's fine to have practically zero customer support, but only if you have a self-serve system that actually works, such as having products that rarely break and having ability to order replacements if things do break.

What else is there to say about VR...it's absolutely AMAZING!  About the closest I can equate it to that you might understand is from watching black and white TV all of your life and then seeing a 3D TV. I had tried some VR back in the early 90s, but this is far and beyond that.  Also, check out YouTube videos (like I did) and you will see that HTC's Vive is the way to go.  It is expensive, but well worth the price.  My mother of 75 absolutely loved it...with her heart condition and other health issues, she can't ride roller coasters for instance, but I was able to let her ride one from Six Flags.  There is also quite a bit of free content for the Vive via Steam today (and that is another plus for the Vive...it's linked to Steam).  You can be guaranteed that since you are adding content via Steam, that it will still be around in the event you change to another Steam supported VR platform...I've been burned by other companies having their own software platforms and then going bankrupt, but I think we can assume that Steam is here to stay for a while.:)

TL;DR; - 1x controller dead on arrival, very poor customer service, still waiting on a refund nearly 3 weeks after confirmed receipt at Amazon Warehouse!---After receiving the product and paying very expensive shipping to Hong Kong, while it was noted as ""Used"" I let the initial impressions of a bad smelling device (musty smell) go, and get down to seeing how the device actually performed.Getting everything installed was OK, but once in VR, it was noted that one of the controllers wasn't working properly - either as though the home button was jammed on, or the battery wasn't holding charge. Contacted the seller who offered ""$75 for a repair"" of the item. It was visible on that specific controller that the device had been opened before. This was the state that it ARRIVED in.

Great the 3 times I used it. It was kept in its original packaging when not in use... this thing looks and feels brand new and yet the fourth time I took it out of its box it no longer works! The screen just has snow (like the old TVs would have). I tried unplugging the cable and plugging it back into the headset but still just snow. Not sure if the cable is somehow malfunctioning or if it’s the port itself or whether there is some other unseen problem causing it. HTC does not make it easy to contact them regarding the the warranty as they only advise that I contact the retailer that I purchased it from to start the warranty process. However Amazon does not give me the option to contact the retailer when I pull up my order history. They only give a link for the HTC support library which it notes is “offered by HTC” but the HTC support library doesn’t give anyway to contact them about the warranty. Plus I am suppose to the contact the retailer according to the warranty documents!

Needless to say the AM3 platform with a Phenom II X4 955 wasnt cutting it.

This is my first venture into VR, and in general I find my self frequently oscillating between being very impressed and very disappointed.This gear is well made, well throughout, comfortable, and tracks very well. That said this kit is take a bit of knowledge and effort to get working well.Aside from this gear, VR overall is still super immature. There are not that many good/finished/polished games, the pixel density on all of the headsets is to low, it is easy to get motion sick, and there is no eye tracking.Realistically it is going to take at least a few more years for the hardware and software to get to the point where it is actually easy, immersive, and fun.

So i've had the VIVE Pro for about a month now and I have to say, for me, it was worth the price to upgrade from the original.I have had the original VIVE since launch. I will say that because of the comfort increase, I have started using the vive MUCH more than I used to. Not only that but setting up the light houses was quite a bit easier as you no longer need the long 20 ft cable connecting the light houses that used to be required.The only reason i'm not giving the VIVE Pro 5 stars is because of the price. Like I said, it was worth the upgrade because i am using it a fair amount more, and I get good worthwhile use out of it. But, given the small upgrades in comfort and display/set up - I don't think those things justify the cost. The VIVE Pro should be the default vive package and should be priced accordingly. It feels like a more consumer friendly product overall. I don't think many people will consider it a good buy at this price point, and unless you have some extra money to burn I would recommend getting the original vive and just purchasing the aftermarket head strap/built in speakers.The only negative thing outside of price I have to say is the quality on the headphones isnt' as good as my normal headphones i use on my PC. The fact that you can't easily replace them via an audio jack is disappointing and an oversight in my opinion.  While not a deal breaker, it just lowers an experience that was elevated in every other regard.

Purchased the Vive PRO.  To date, have had a base station fail.  Rest of the hardware has operated without issues.  However, the software side is poor to say the least.  Numerous issues with the sound quality with the Vive Pro.  None of the answers available online are a permanent solution.  Therefore, your nice $1200 headset with sub-par controllers tends to be more annoying when solving sound issues than ""fun"".I've spent more time troubleshooting this device for my family to where I don't have any interest in touching it myself.  The audio issues make it a complete pain in the ass.  What's worse is, these issues have been reported for quite some time without any improvement to the sound quality and reliability.For a premium home product, it's barely worth 2 stars for the frustration it's caused.  I'd launch it from my roof rather than spend anymore time on it if the family didn't enjoy it *when working*.

I got the system when is was on sale (still very expensive!). I do get motion sickness very easily and is always hesitant about VR. For this headset I have no issue with motion sickness.I was a little disappointed that the set did not come with the wireless adapter (thats is extra $$).I did try PS4VR and it just simply is not comparable quality wise. PS4VR is a lot cheaper, however does not do room scale tracking, and gave me motion sickness on same game I would play on the Vive Pro. It should be noted that we have plenty of space at home and we track at least a 6ft x 5ft area for play and run on a NVIDIA 1070 Ti graphics card with other beefed up components.Some people mention tracking issues, for me I never had any issue with tracking playing a well constructed game. It should be noted that I set my Vive Pro up in a theater room with dark walls and no reflective surface or open windows.All in all a very solid VR system. I would recommend to anyone with a disposable income and enough space to get the benefits out of the room tracking system.

I really wanted to love the Pro the way I've loved the original.I'm giving 4 stars because the headset deserves a 5 but the new lighthouses deserve a 3.When I got the pro, some steam glitches made it have a bunch of issues (Not the fault of the vive) but identifying those issues was made much more challenging by the sliding glass door in the room where it is set up.The new lighthouses have some major issues with reflections.  I was able to solve this issue by installing Curtains.Install of curtains was not very hard, but I hate having to use 3rd party solutions with a new device.

After about two weeks it had a base station fail and the left ear went out. Tried to get a replacement and all amazon ended up doing was refunding me the money.

The VR form the HTC Vive Pro is probably great, I don't know yet. During the initial setup I noticed that one of the base stations was making an annoying whining sound. Contacted HTC Vive support via chat and was told that I would need to send in the defective unit. However, I was told that I would have to cover the cost of shipping. HTC only reimburses shipping cost if their support staff determines that the unit was indeed defective. How does HTC define the word defective? Will they say that I opened the box like an idiot and blame me for the damage? I have already spent alot of money on this and they assume I will continue to pay, which is true and is most likely the reason they get away it.  At this point I don't even know if I want to finish the setup, I don't know if the rest of it is broken too. Maybe I'll use the Vive Pro to virtually weigh down papers. Maybe virtual reality is just as good with one base station, I doubt it.I will update this review in fifteen days or so, when my repaired base station is returned.For HTC, if you find this review to be defective and feel that it should have been a five star review. Please send your defective review to me via the post. If I deem the review to be defective, I will reimburse the shipping cost and return an amended review.

Going from the rift s to to the Vive, is like going from 720p to 4K. It's insane on how big of difference in quality. It's weighs probably 20% less which gives it cheaper feel with it's thin plastic. Using it besides the better video graphics, it has its own video power which makes run alot more stable. The only problem I run into the headset fitting comfortably.

Overall I'm loving the Vive and VR in general. Most of my friends have had little to no issues with it either. It's fun to play with as a group in challenges or just watching someone else try to succeed in a game.The only drawback so far has been HTC themselves. One of the lighthouses went flashing red after two weeks of use. HTC confirmed it's a known issue. Only repair option is to mail it in. This can take 4+ weeks. Meanwhile you're stuck to seated games or a 1400 dollar paperweight. Fortunately Amazon was able to ship a replacement, but it's a whole kit. HTC is losing a ton more money this way but they don't seem to care about that.

From my experience with other headsets, I can say this is definetly the best performance vr headset in the market. The early adopter tax is high on this one, however if you are looking for the best immersion experience (responsiveness and resolution) today, you shouldn’t look further. I just hope they could develop something to fix the dizziness that comes from your inner ear not receiving the same input as your eyes, It really shortens the amount of time you can spend on each session.

Using this to play games on SteamVR. The motion tracking and response to head rotation and the controllers is extremely good, completely seamless. Setup wasn't too hard.

Amazing visuals and very responsive.  I use it for flight sims and it’s just like being the cockpit.  Very comfortable design, easily adjustable, and well balanced when in use.

I received the Vive Pro kit on May 10th. I was super excited to try it out as this was my first VR system. Unfortunately, one of the 2.0 base stations was dead upon arrival. I contacted HTC support and after 2 hours of troubleshooting they deemed the base station faulty. They then recommended that I return the kit.I have since begun the process of returning the kit for a replacement and it has gone smoothly. I expect to receive a new kit within the week. It sucks to have to pay so much for this kit and an essential part of the system to be dead on arrival. However, it may have been an oddity.Also HTC needs to update their installer for this kit. The installer has the Vive Pro headset in the installer. It didn't change the trackers which do not have channel indicators and it didn't update the LED light identifiers.Overall I had a blast for my first VR experience. It's a shame that I have to spend so long without it.Update: I have recieved my new Vive Pro as of 5/17/18 and all of the components are fully working. I'm very glad that Amazon's returns are extremely prompt and very easy to do.

Is this price ($1400) for real? it appears to be correctVIVE Pro - Full Kit $1399Includes the VIVE Pro headset, link box, DisplayPort™ cable, USB 3.0 cable, power adaptors, two Controllers (2018), two base stations 2.0, user guide, safety guide and warranty card.Vive Pro starter kit: $1098does not include the new (2018) controllers and basethis kit includes• the VIVE Pro headset• base stations and Controller 1.0 ( older controllers)I thought that Amazon had increase the price but now I believe they have price correctly.  I canceled this order and purchased the one for 1098.  Now should one get the newest controller with better tracking or not.  Is it worth the extra 200 bucks.  Not sure but for now I have the starter kit inrouter as I cancel this order maybe too soon…Should one exchange it for the newest?

Great picture makes you feel like you're actual in the game. Only issue I had purchased this for my laptop and the displayport cable wasn't compatible with it, I had to purchase another cable for it to work properly. For my laptop it was a mini displayport to mini displayport.

If you purchase this for a laptop be aware of what graphics card you're laptop uses and what kin of cable you will need

The helmet position was changing randomly in virtual reality after several minutes of playing. I don't know if it was a hardware or software bug. I had to return it.

This is a cutting-edge VR system. No, it’s not cheap. If you’re on a tight budget, buy the regular Vive bundle. The Vive Pro is worth every penny for early adopters (like me) who are willing to pay a premium for the latest and greatest technology.

This HMD is amazing, sure its a little on the steep side for pricing but you have to pay to play.  HTC is also very smart to pick this price point because it boots scalpers back onto scalping classic consoles.
