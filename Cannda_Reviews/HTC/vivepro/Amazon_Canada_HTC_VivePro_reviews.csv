I'm passionate about VR and have been since i first played Dactyl Nightmare in the 90s.  I enjoyed the Vive a ton and the upgrade to the Vive pro is a huge step in terms of visuals.  Everything is clearer, the screen door effect is nearly gone and the headset is much more comfortable.  The built in headphones are great and seem better than those on the premium strap upgrade but are still basic.In the box for my unit was an annual Viveport Subscription which gives you access to 5 games a month for 12 months (worth $144 CAD) & a Viveport credit of $125 CAD to purchase games.If you already have a Vive and enjoy it a lot, this is a great upgrade.  If you don't, the price tag just doesn't make sense.

Image quality so much better than original Vive. Headset is much more comfortable and cable more compact and less distracting. Screen door effect much less noticeable though not entirely eliminated. God rays effect is lessened too though still present especially for games with deep blacks such as Elite Dangerous. There remains an issue with the sweet spot of focus for me, still too narrow (compared to say the Quest) causing blur at the edges. Perhaps related to FOV, though I have an above average head size and pupil distance which might be the cause of this in my case.Still, overall a terrific improvement, which with a slightly lower price and the addition of wireless would easily be the best VR I've experienced yet.Loss of one star though for the price which even as an upgrade is a little on the high side, and far worse for the whole package.

So I have had this for a few days now, and would consider myself a VR enthusiast. This is purely for personal use, no business or professional stuff at all. And I paid full price... so part of me wants to feel good about the money I spent, but I'm well aware it is still overpriced.Main take away; the increased pixel density is noticeable. Text is much easier to read, and everything is much more clear. As you have surely read, the screen door effect is not gone. But, it's far less intrusive. I found particularly in driving games on the regular Vive it was distracting. But now, it's minimal. This is a big plus, and 90% of the reason I wanted it.Audio. The speakers are much worse. Really disappointed there. I have been hooked on Beat Saber, but now the music sounds super flat and dull. Takes the groove out of the game.Update: use a powered USB hub, seems to help a lot.Comfort. At first, I was afraid it was worse, but then watched the video and now it's about equal I'd say. Perhaps better balanced. Put the mask on first, then lower the strap behind you after, and then adjust the top strap last. Then move the ear pieces. It's pretty  good, but not a huge improvement.Other things I've noticed, every now and then the audio is very crackly. Have to reboot it to fix. And I'm noticing my base stations are wonkier than before. Maybe a firmware update is to come.So, if you love VR, this is a good buy. It makes everything better. If you have kinda slowed down using VR, this probably won't reignite the flame, unless you mostly like driving games, or maybe text heavy games like Elite Dangerous.

I was very skeptical about Vive Pro and the overall improvement in resolution and SDE based on so many people complaining that the difference is not much noticeable. I took the dive anyways and bought the Vive Pro, and I'm happy to say It's a major improvement. I see a clear difference with higher resolution and image clarity. SDE is much reduced. While perceived image quality is subjective but I would say anyone who claims that there's no noticeable difference need to have their vision checked.The SDE effect is still there though and noticeable but not as horrible as OG Vive. Also, major improvement in comfort as well compared to OG Vive with DAS. I have Vive Wireless Adapter on top and still the headset is extremely comfortable for hours of gameplay.One star off for audio quality which is a complete disappointment compared to DAS. I don't have tinny sound issues as many were reporting, but the volume and bass levels are extremely lacking for my taste. After hours of researching and troubleshooting I ended up 3D printing Vive Pro bass clips that press headphones more firmly on my ears (you can get the 3D file from Vive Community discussion forum).Lenses, FOV and god rays are exact same as OG Vive. I bought a 6mm face foam that allows for a little improvement in FOV. The cable compartment door on headset is way too flimsy and easy to break. It's a bad design. Be careful when opening and be gentle.Mic quality is on par with OG Vive but overall it's not good. I don't use mic anyways. Camera quality is a bit worse though. Currently there's a bug with SteamVR that it doesn't allow to change camera rate so it's locked are 45. If I can change it to 60 and notice improvement I'll update the review. The dual camera stereo room view with pass through is extremely cool, but again everyone is experiencing a bug now that the stereo separation is incorrect and you feel like cross-eyed.Amazon initially shipped an open box (seal broken) but they were quick to send a new sealed box the next day so again best service from Amazon to quickly correct the mistake.There are currently other headset on the rise such as Pimax 5K+ and 8K, but it all depends on your choices and priorities. My #1 priority is wireless. Wired VR gaming was never an option for me and a total immersion breaker. My first dive in VR was with OG Vive, TPCast and Fallout 4 VR, so that's where I'm coming from. I've never played wired. Pimax headsets consumer launches are months away, and no updates on wireless module plans. I can easily give up a wider FOV for wireless option and better support any day.The bottom line - Vive Pro is the ultimate current headset available for consumers. It has it's pros and cons but it depends on your priorities, system specs, choices and budget. Is it worth 999? Absolutely not; it's way overpriced. Is it the best headset? Yes absolutely, depending what your prioritize.Until Pimax 5K+ ships with a wireless module or the Vive 2.0 becomes available, this is the best of the best you can get. Hoe this helped.

It wasn’t made clear that the headset doesn’t come with everything you need.  Does not come with the base stations, had to purchase after seeing on the box that they are required.  Also the headset was very finicky to set up, constantly failing to connect and randomly asking for firmware updates after already having done previous firmware updates.  Seems like the software could use some improvement.  Shortly after setting up the headset a brand new video card failed, not sure if that’s related or not, but if it happens again after replacement I’ll update my review.

The Vive is still my favourite VR headset on the consumer market. Having room scale VR has been a fantasy of mine since seeing the holodeck on Star Trek and immediately asking my mom where we could buy one. I love getting lost in a world that is a little weird and takes some getting used to, but it's still me in it. Unfortunately the Vive pro missteps in several key areas.First off the good points. The image quality is fantastic. I did a side by side with the original Vive and there is a noticeable difference in clarity. Being able to read text from across the room like at an optomitrist office is not able to be done in the original Vive. In the pro i was able to read across the entire play space which is a good 10 feet. This will no doubt become far more important as VR games get more detailed. Another big plus is the strap. It is easy to adjust to basically any head size including my massive head. The frame fits snugly and the foam has enough give that it doesn't hurt my head. The weight is also well balanced. The original Vive was noticeably front heavy. The pro addresses this issue with the heavy duty plastic wrap around design and it does feel more comfortable. This made playing longer sessions much better.What I absolutely cannot endorse are the included headphones. They sound like the old blown out speakers my middle school used in classrooms. For most gamers this may not be a big issue. However, take a look at the number 2 top selling VR game. Beat Saber. A rhythm game with VERY bass heavy music. You do not get the same impact during the song if it sounds like it's coming out of a tin can. Props to HTC for making these removable. I encountered a similar problem with the original Vive, but this issue was resolved by my lovely pair of bluetooth headphones. The super comfy strap unfortunately means that headphones do not sit on your head properly.  This makes waving your arms and head around really challenging which defeats the whole point of VR.The Vive pro definitely proves that it is the best quality consumer headset out there right now. The picture is great and it is more comfortable than its predecessor which might be enough to justify the increased cost for some. For audiophiles like myself it is a disappointment. I will stick with my original Vive for now and hope that the next gen headset can deliver a truly upgraded experience.

Price aside, this thing is good, just not great. All you're really getting over the old Vive & Deluxe Audio Strap is a resolution bump, which reminds me of when I upgraded my CRT from a 1024x760 to a 1600x1200 model. Everything is sharper, the details in textures really pop, objects and characters in are way more visible in the distance. It's a welcome upgrade, but there's plenty of room for improvement.I like that the headphones are cup shaped now, but the audio quality is still that of a $10 set of headphones. They also got rid of the spring mechanism from the Deluxe Strap that let you remove the old headset without having to adjust the head band ring, so that's a step back to me.Unfortunately, when you look at what you're getting for the money, and that you NEED to buy/have the towers and controllers as well, it just doesn't make sense.

Though there is NO way of knowing this from the Amazon listing, this headset WILL NOT WORK unless you ALSO buy at least one additional base station (~$200).This is not mentioned ANYWHERE in the product specifications and requirements. In fact, there are additional requirements (that you can ONLY find after digging through HTC's online forums), including a heavy-duty power supply unit.This headset is already a substantial investment over Oculus and the HTC Vive, yet it is not ""ready to use"" at all.

My $700 Vive headset broke only 2 weeks after receiving it.  Treated the unit like it was gold but it crapped out ...barely got to use it!  Talked with customer service a couple times...unhelpful.  Sent the unit in, carefully bubblewrapped etc.  A month later VIVE gets back to me and says they found moisture in the unit.  Check the web...appears this is VIVE's standard line to thousands of others, looking to place blame on customers for their faulty product design.  The next step in their customer service protocol of ""blame the customer, we won't repair it"" is pay us $270US to repair it, and make your decision within 12 hours else we will disregard your claim as they can't keep the claim open any longer (making up a false short timeline to squeeze customers to make rash decisions, usually by kids and teens).  I would strongly advise ""buyer beware"" before considering any HTC purchase ...their customer service is a scam.  However you may also want to google ""Oculus Rift"" for repair warranty issues and you will find story after story of happy customers whose needs have been addressed by a reputable company.

Well, yes they improved the quality, a bit less screen door effect. But honestly i find that its barely noticeable compared to the old Vive.I feel like initially you see the difference but after 15min the feeling is the same. The biggest difference is with the text which is sharper.But is it worth 1000$? No.Also i found that the headset doesn't fit as well as the older model. Some light can pass through the nose part and i did try to make it fit correctly (so did my friend who tried it on).The head support is poorer than the deluxe audio strap. This strap feel cheap and the speaker doesn't fit as well as the deluxe audio strap.I have bought mine from HTC directly and i have just initiated a return after 4days of trying it.Its honestly a complete rip off, it is not worth this amount of money, save it for the next generation.

I had previously given this 5 stars and raved about how the upgraded resolution looks.  I’m sad to say I have to do a 180 on that review.  After less than a month of using my vive Pro it started having various issues across the board.  I was getting red, green, blue static dots and both the video and audio would separately go out, or go out together.I contacted vive support and after going through troubleshooting steps with them that I had already tried on my own they finally agreed to send me a replacement cable to see if that was the issue (this was the link cable that goes from the hmd to the link box).  The replacement cable did not fix the issue yet support forced me to do the same troubleshooting steps yet again!  Finally they agreed to set it up for repair.  So I sent it out AT MY OWN COST and after 3 weeks to a month I got it back, in worse condition than I sent it out in!  Now all I get is flashing light and never see or hear ANYTHING!So let me ask you what kind of company charges $800 for something that NEVER works right, has you go through painstaking steps before agreeing to let YOU pay to send it to them and then sends it back to you even more broken than it was before?!  I currently have an email out to HTC about this and am waiting to hear back.  I will update this review if HTC turns this situation around for me and gets me a working vive pro but as of now it has been one of if not the worst experience I’ve ever had with a consumer electronic!

It is an incredibly comfortable headset. No dizziness for me and most that have tried mine.With a suitable graphics card and a PC that is at least a quad core i7, this will provide an amazing experience. In some ways its therapeutic.You need also two base stations and at least one paddle. Vive do their own base stations (AKA light houses) but for larger spaces there is an alternatives.  A good Internet connection is highly recommended - there s a lot to download when changing VR experiences.Now is a good time to buy as NVidia graphics card prices are on the slide due to the decline in the bitcoin market. You need at least an NVidia 1080 (or equivalent from another supported vendor) but for realistic Ray Tracing capability, one of the NVidia 2080 series is best. The graphics card must have a display port.I've stopped using it with XPlane 11 flight sim only because it is too addictive but with a powerful graphics card and full AI, the experience becomes extraordinarily realistic.Until a few months ago this was a top of the range. There's a new headset on the horizon with 4K per eye and 220 degree viewing angle but not from Vive and is USB-C (the future standard agreed for VR headsets). This model doesn't have USB-C but delivered with the required hardware. Setting up of the VR the first time can be a bit tricky.VR is not quite real life but the available media out there for games and eduction is phenomenal - highly recommend Google Earth VR, Apollo 11 Mission, The Lab, etc. Kids would enjoy walking amongst dinosaurs and its something the whole family would enjoy.While a fan of Apple Computers, getting them working with graphics processors (eGPU's) s has been tricky. Microsoft Windows (10 ideally) is currently the most supported platform for games and VR software.I hope you get one and enjoy it as much as I enjoy mine!

A diferencia de el HTC Vive regular, la resolucion de este headset es increible, dile adios a las letras borrosas cuando intentas leer menus o texto dentro de tus juegos VR.Lo bueno:-El strap con audio es excelente, infinitamente superior al vive regular. El audio es bastante bueno, pero nada impresionante pero la conveniencia de no tener que conectar audifonos externos es bienvenida-Las bocinas pueden ser removidas y ajustadas segun tus necesidades-No mas texto borroso en los juegos-Solamente requiere un cable, ya no son 3 como en el vive regularLo malo-Necesitas minimo una 1080Ti para no estar en constante reprojection (si no te molesta esto, o si no sabes lo que es, entonces ni te preocupes)en juegos pesados como Skyrim VR,Fallout 4 VR o Doom VFR.-Removieron el jack de 3mm para audifonos, ahora se requiere de un adaptador externo USB C  (esto duele si quieres usar audifonos premium)-Por el precio, no incluye ni las bases, ni los controles, esto significa que si no tienes un vive regular con los sensores y controles, tienes que adquirirlos por separado y el precio se dispara.-Hasta el momento, no hay juegos ni apps que utilizen las dos camaras frontales, solo una esta activada en estos momentos.Resumen: La parte ""PRO"" del nombre de este producto no parece ser una broma o una tecnica de mercadotecnia, este producto definitivamente no esta hecho para el consumidor regular. Es un excelente equipo pero si no vas a participar en el desarrollo de aplicaciones o juegos en VR yo sugeriria abstenerse y disfrutar el vive regular por un año mas, en lo que se desarrollan las nuevas versiones para consumidores.

Like others have said, yes it has better visuals, but not by a lot. That being said, I can never go back to the old Vive that I own. The comfort is underestimated, it allows you to have longer VR sessions which is what its all about!  The sound is ""good enough"" nothing bad and nothing great. Its simply good sound.-Reading Text is much better! (that also goes for UI's, Health bars, ammo bars etc!..-Seeing gun crosshairs is WAY easier! (you can hit targets! your aim is on point!)-Seeing farther and clearer is HUGE! (I shot a arrow straight up in Skyrim and followed it all the way down!)The Pro blocks out the real world like a Champion! no light passes though the nose guard (which is more comfortable I might add) And the headphones cups your ears to block out outside noise. what this translates to is a more immersive experience and longer VR sessions which is a HUGE plus! I mean its what its all about, right?!This small bump is actually HUGE why? because its just the right amount of tech that still runs the current hardware! We are a few years away from a proper Gen 2 HMD, (that also goes for the computer hardware to run the new HMD) so this will pass the time if its worth it to you.Simply put, if you want the best VR.. look no further, this is it.  The best room-scale tracking coupled with this HMD will allow you to experience the absolute best VR that's currently available!A personal note:I have to say, after modding the hell out of Skyrim it does LOOK SICK (45+ mods and tweaks). I was chilling behind Riverwood at night (with darker nights mod) crouched with my back against the mountain, listening to the sounds looking up at the insane sky with stars shining and the moon, cloud movement dancing on the mountain tops etc...Just taking it all in, it was so awe inspiring, I am constantly at a loss of words with this setup. This is a expensive unit, no doubt.. but do you think for a second I would trade it for the countless ""oh crap!"" moments i've had, not on your life!As a kid in the 80's staring at store shelves filled with awesome hand drawn box cover art of high fantasy PC games. Wishing I could just teleport inside those images and explore the majestic worlds within, now finally after all these years, here I am.I took a few screenshots last night, just to capture the moment, but it doesn't tell the tale.

Let me preface that I am (was) a diehard HTC supporter when it comes to VR. I tried Oculus Rift, several Windows MR headsets, and HTC Vive (the original, not Pro). I felt that Vive had the best implementation as far as tracking, expandability, and connectivity to PC. Some feel that Oculus controllers are better, but personally I prefer Vive wands. I have owned original Vive for over a year and the whole family (and friends) love to use it and play VR games. With that said, I purchased Vive Pro at a (ridiculously) high price because to me it was worth it and I was looking forward to upgrades. What a disappointment it was! Just to be clear - I ordered two different headsets and one full Vive Pro kit (with new 2.0 base stations and new 2.0 controllers) because I wanted to make sure I didn’t get a dud. I experienced various issues with all of them and they were all returned. The tracking was worse comparing to my original Vive, one headset would not keep the floor leveled no matter what I tried and how many times I ran room calibration, controllers would not always show up, constant connection issues when headset would need to be re-plugged, one headset would have flickering lights in the HMD… etc. It was just awful, and it was in exact same large room that is perfect for VR that my original Vive works perfectly, connected to the same high-power gaming rig. I re-installed Windows fresh twice thinking maybe it was related to previous Vive installation or something similar, so I started fresh and the same issues persisted. I spent hours on user forums, reddit, HTC support forum looking for answers and was amazed how many people have similar issues and all the crazy workarounds one need to do to get it to work properly sometimes.With all that, the worst part was HTC support. I contacted them to see what they can suggest in one of the scenarios and after explaining everything that I have already tried, the rep said that HMD must be defective and needs to be sent to them for repairs and it is covered under warranty. Here is the kick though – as others mentioned in reviews, you have to pay to ship anything to HTC out of your pocket, they won’t reimburse you or provide a shipping label even though the product is defective, they won’t do advance exchange, you have to wait at least two weeks... and if they determine (at their own discretion) that it is something that is not covered by the warranty you will have to either pay to have it fixed (at a quote they will give you later) or have to pay to get your non-working part back. Needless to say, I simply returned all of them to the retailers I bought them from and I will never buy it again. I have since talked to several other VR users that had very similar experiences with Vive Pro. I understand that any product can have issues and kinks may need to work out, but when the company doesn’t stand behind the product they have built and does not support the adopters of their products – this is really the worst business practice and the easiest way to push your supporters away. I would highly recommend doing your research before buying HTC Vive Pro, most likely you will be disappointed and will not enjoy it; and if you’ll need support from HTC – be ready to pay more and wait. I still think that original Vive is a good product and I continue using it. One of my base stations stopped working on the original Vive and even though it was still under warranty I had to pay shipping and wait two weeks to get it fixed… oh well… at least I can still use it an enjoy it. My next VR set will NOT be an HTC product unless the company addresses the bugs and more importantly changes their customer support approach.

I have had a regular Vive with Deluxe Audio Strap and have played it almost daily for about a year so I have a solid experience with which to compare. There is a price premium on the Pro and it's not for everyone. If you are budget conscious, there's no need to save up to buy the Pro. If you like the best of what's available, then give this one a shot.1) Set-up was a breeze. I followed the instructions offered on the Vive website (although you could just install it without referring to the website as it's very obvious what needs to be done). Important to note: The original Vive plugged into an HDMI connector on my video card. The Pro requires the display port adapter on the video card. I also manually forced a firmware update on the headset.2) The unit ships with ONE face pad while the original Vive shipped with two (Wide and Narrow). The face pad for the Pro is slightly larger along the top edge. The original face pads will work with it but they don't provide as much padding but it's not really noticeable). So far, nobody sells face pads for the Vive Pro (not even HTC).3) The display is noticeably clearer. When I put on the Pro headset and stood in the Steam VR Home, I was amazed at the difference. The graininess and screen doo effect are noticeably reduced. It's not perfect but it IS an improvement which you can see. When in games, the improvements eventually fade into the normal playing experience but everything does look better. This helps with reading text (particularly flight sims).4) The comfort of the Pro headset is improved. It rests on the head with better balance and fit. It requires more adjustments when swapping between players. The Deluxe head strap was much easier to adjust quickly.5) The audio is about the same as the deluxe head strap. I haven't seen any improvement in quality or comfort. I do like the inclusion of a volume adjustment and microphone mute button on the ear pieces.6) Adjustment buttons. I like the simplified adjustment used to move the display closer or further from your eyes. Apparently you can do this on the original Vive but it required pressing two buttons. The IPD adjustment knob (adjusts the left-right spacing of the lenses) is a little more difficult to turn. The old one was a know which you could turn by twisting it between your thumb and finger. The Pro is more of a hheel than you need to use a finger to rotate. Not a big deal, but it's something I noticed..Overall, I am happy I have this as I like to have the best experiences I can when playing. At the current price, it's not for everyone and for most, I would say that buying the normal Vive will more than satisfy, especially if you take the money saved and buy a better video card. One crowd that might like this are hardcore flight sim players as there tends to be a lot of text which you need to read. The Pro certainly helps make the text  more legible.

Honestly, after reading a lot of the reviews saying the quality isn't ""that big of an improvement"" I was extremely hesitant to buy this. But man, I'm really glad I did. Where the headphones are garbage, you can remove them and use whatever headphones you see fit. (I use Wireless Steel Series Siberia 800, great headset to use with it) The strap is a little clunky, as it is easy to notch back if you try to get it too tight, however, you don't need it so tight it's breaking your face to use it properly.I've noticed a lot of people who seem to have problems with the lack of quality don't understand that your computer needs to be good enough to handle it. It's quite a lot more taxing on your system than the normal vive and thus wont work perfectly on every system that previously could use vive just fine. That being said, if you do have a computer that can handle the increased pixels, you'll definitely notice it.

Got this after a month-long wait (thanks, COVID!), only for it not to work.  Several hours of troubleshooting and I narrowed it down to the proprietary link cable from the headset to the [pointless] base station.  By the way, these used to interface directly with the PC via standard cabling, but the base station was added with the latest models so they can gouge you to go wireless with bluetooth...using only their overpriced add-ons, of course.As far as trying to get it to work, everything said it was working great, but nothing except a blank, bright screen in the display.  SteamVR would come up as ""running"" and not turn off, with no display on the screen.  The HTC software they try to trick people into installing (note: you don't need to install it at all)  is utter garbage and even caused driver and resource conflicts with Steam.  My computer is no slouch, met or far exceeded all requirements, and I've gotten three other VR systems to work with far less hassle in the past.  I'm not new to this.  I found plenty of videos and write-ups with workarounds on older models that HTC has seen fit to change so you're stuck with their deficient hardware, or I might have taken it apart on day one just to get it functioning.It's simply a defective product, and I should have done some deeper searching for what HTC hasn't crawler-bombed out of search indexes to know that before I bought it.  Everything about it is an insidious cash grab and the sleek exterior hides some shoddy craftsmanship where it really counts.  At least Amazon makes the return easy.  I imagine they do several.

I have a Vive and bought this for the added resolution.  The display resolution is better than the Vive, but they really went downhill with the headband and headphone design.  The audio quality is crap - no bass at all.  They are also really bulky and make you look even more dorky than you do wearing a VIve.  I took the earphones off mine and use a Logitech headset instead.  The headband is sort of like the DAS, except its much bulkier, sticks out in the back, is uncomfortable compared to the DAS, and the whole thing is about 6 ounces heavier than the Vive - yes, it is heavier, not lighter than a Vive with the DAS, contrary to what HTC claims.  In addition, the headband does not have the spring loaded feature that the DAS has, so donning and removing the headset is now more difficult.  They only give you one face pad that is ""improved"" but in fact it is stiffer and less comfortable than the ones that come with Vive - took me a long time to break mine in to where it felt reasonably comfortable on my head, and only after applying a lot of velcro at the edges to make it conform to my face.  On the plus side the AMOLED display technology makes bright scenes feel less like you're getting your eyes cooked, and it seems easier on the eyes overall.  Tracking is very good and might actually be better than the Vive, using the standard Vive lighthouses.  The resolution is incrementally better than the Vive and actually makes a difference for applications like X-Plane or Elite Dangerous, but for most games, or just casual VR entertainment, it's not worth the added cost.  My Vive Pro was defective right out of the box and it took me a while to convince HTC to the point they would generate an RMA so I could return it via Amazon.  After some finagling, I was able to get Amazon to ship me the replacement without charging my credit card twice (then getting a refund later).  The one I have now seems to work fine - no issues after several months.  One last thing - it's also not the shade of blue that it appears to be in the photos - it's almost black.

I've owned many VR headsets and systems over the past few years, and the Vive pro has to be the only one that's seriously made me question its price. As of current, I have a original Vive, Original Rift, Valve Index, a dell visor that I sold, and now a Vive Pro HMD. It's not all bad, but there's no reason it should be nearly 800$ for the headset alone. Lets get into it.Pros:To start. This headset is very light and comfortable in comparison to some of the other headsets I've owned. The balance of the weight seems to be nicely distributed across the skull, while fitting snug on the face. I'd say that, depending on who you asked, it's as comfortable or even more comfortable then the index. It's lighter then the index, and better balanced. A definite improvement in that regard.Additionally, the display is much better then the original Vive's. It's not perfect, and it definitely still has a screen door effect, but not nearly as blatant as older headsets like the Rift and Vive.Microphone is also a great improvement. It's still not the best out of all the headsets I own, but it's much better than the Rift and Vive.Cons:Unfortunately there's quite a few cons I have for this headset. The first major one I noticed was the earphones. They're TERRIBLE. For the price and size of the earmuffs, this is simply an unacceptable quality of sound for a ""pro"" headset. The Vive's audio strap accessory even blows it completely out of the water, and I'd say that the rift's dinky headphones are about par with this headset. Seeing as the original rift is worth less then half of this headset, I find it extremely frustrating. The audio has almost now low-end and is very ""tinny"".Next is the proprietary cable. This isn't a show stopper... but the fact that I had to buy a 60$ accessory pack to attach my wireless module to the already 800$ new headset is insane in my opinion. Seems like a very large anti-consumer move from HTC. The link box is fine though, and the length of the cable is adequate, but the same accessory pack for the Cosmos is cheaper AND comes with a spare battery with the same cable...My last major gripe with this headset is the lens they chose. It seems that they decided to just use the same lenses from the original vive. Godrays and glare are just as bad or even seemingly worse then the vive, and that's just unacceptable for a headset of this caliper. Additionally, the IPD adjustment doesn't allow for tighter adjustment then 61.5mm, while it's advertised as a range from 60-73mm just like the original viveOverall:In all honesty, if I didn't need this headset to keep wireless adapter and upgrade to the 2.0 base stations, then I'd say to avoid it at all cost. Weigh your options with other headsets. It's way overpriced for what it is, and with better options on the market like Index and Pimax, it's not justifiable. If you already own a vive, then just keep it... this isn't much of an improvement in any way other then slightly improved pixel density and microphone quality. I got this headset for 500$, so 300$ cheaper then MSRP, and it's still not worth that in value. It should be a 400$ package for just the HMD, and maybe 700-800$ for the full kit it to really be worth it. Anything more and it's beat by better options for better prices.Thanks for coming to my TED talk

Was on the fence for a while due to the reviews suggesting this headset is not worth the upgrade but eventually decided to try it out.I had the original Vive for two years, I upgraded the original strap and I loved using it, but was hoping for a better picture quality as well as an upgrade in comfort. the Vive pro headset only is obviously not cheap, but it delivers on image quality and comfort in a big way. it made me enthusiastic about using VR again, being able to stay in it for longer periods and enjoying the experience on almost every level.It took me about 15 minutes to connect, download, install and pair with my existing controllers and sensors and it's just an amazing VR system. the only downside for me is the headphones, they are not terrible but they are not worthy of the Vive pro experience.All in all, it's fantastic upgrade, you will still not be able to watch movies comfortably in it, but it will make your older VR set feel as a thing of the past.If you are looking to upgrade or looking to start with VR, I think you should no longer consider the classic set, which was amazing when it came out, but not even close to what this new generation experience has to offer. it's like suggesting to buy a standard definition TV when HD is widely available.

Being using original Vive since May 2016. Almost exclusively with prescribed lenses because my eyesight is not so good. So all this time I could really see the screen door effect of the original Vive. It was nearly impossible for me to 'forget' about it, only briefly during some dark scenes. But! With the Pro model SDE is much much less noticeable, text is much much more readable. I can finally almost forget about SDE and just keep playing or watching movies on the Big Screen.Enhanced comfort is not something to be frown upon. There are three major points here: finally I can wear my glasses with absolutely no discomfort and no lens scratching on the tightest dial. It's way lighter (especially then the first version of the original Vive) and it sits tighter and doesn't wiggle on your face.Pros:- Much less noticeable SDE (still visible though)- Text became readable even on 1.3 SS- Giant leap in a comfort. It's lighter and sits tighter- Cable is lighter. But a proprietary port makes it difficult to extend - not a problem for me though, the length is absolutely sufficientCons:- Price is high for just HMD- Plastic is somewhat more crackier then original Vive. Not a big deal, but I like sturdy thingsSome people find headphones not OK. But I could hear any difference between OG and Pro headphones.

So as for me I’m a dcs pilot the thing I hated from the older vive was not been able to read the dials well the pro took care of that is it worth it? Well it depends for me it was. It’s kinda like it cost to be the boss type thing and I don’t regret the pro in the beginning I thought it was not worth it only seen it was a little sharper but enough to read that’s overclocking my 1080 ti but after a day with it I fell in love with it not just the sharpness but the color and the best thing if all the lightness a lot of weight came off the front so now you can play longer and more comfortable I did have one problem the head set one earphone was not working but amazon took care of me and send me another Vive Pro the next day very happy with the product and the service that amazon offers would I recommend this well that depends if your willing to spend 800 dollars but other than that I do recommend it to everyone no question one more thing to add the head set has nice quality sound and it makes it real easy to put on the head set and earphones literally takes about 6 seconds to put on

I have owned the PS VR, original Vive, Oculus, and Vive Pro, so I can compare them all. Yes, the Vive Pro is expensive, but if you can afford it, the Pro is worth it and beats all the rest. You may want a faster CPU and GPU to fully power this beast so you can increase the super-sampling for games like Skyrim VR. That said, the sharper graphics for a fully modded and fine-tuned Skyrim are awe-inspiring! The screen door effect is substantially reduced increasing immersion. Those that don't notice a difference haven't done the work to mod the game.The comfort of this headset cannot be understated compared to the original Vive. It's similar to the Deluxe headgear of the original Vive, but a bit better. It's far easier to put on and adjust, which is great for newbies who come over and want to try VR for the first time. The headphones had a problem with poor bass, but once I installed the updated Vive drivers and de-checked the reduce gain box in the Steam VR settings, the sound fidelity becomes clear and loud. I now have no desire to replace the headphones with something else. Rumbling thunder, music, and rolling boulders all sound great. I also installed a 3D sound mod for Skyrim and get life-like, directional sound that is both immersive and highly useful.I recommend suspending the wire from the ceiling using a kit on Amazon until they come out with the wireless add-on for the Pro. Combine this with the Locomotion app on steam, a fan to give you a nice breeze, and you'll want to jog around Skyrim for hours and never leave. Seeing the northern lights and two giant moons suspended over a gorgeous waterfall and castle atop a mountain is a surreal experience that is beyond words.

This headset is strictly better that the non-pro headset. Yes, graphics are way sharper,  but there are several improvements like: volume control is on headset, unit fits to your face and secures with slide over back of head, there’s a tightening knob that gets the fit just right, and best of all the weight distribution is so much better, it looks and feels so MUCH better! Older non-pro headset pulled on my face over time, I had to snug it so tight to keep it from slipping that my face would have imprints—this issue is completely resolved! So, yes the graphics are gorgeous— but don’t underestimate the value of proper fit! If you VR more than 20 minutes at a time, this headset is totally worth the extra bucks.

Overall the picture quality is worse than the original vive because the sweet spot for viewing the center of the lenses is smaller than the vive. This results in a lot of blurry gameplay if you don't center it perfectly. The vive pro also caused pain while wearing in the nose region.

It is a lot clearer. The screen door has been minimalized greatly. The Red Green Blue around the pixels has been diminished as well. Still not as clear as I had hoped. It's pretty much what I expected the Vive 1.0 to be when I bought it. I understand that hardware needs to catch up before they can come out with a better quality picture, but it is way better than the Vive 1.0 by far. All in all I am happy I bought it. Mostly the new ergonomic design is far superior I think. The only flaw I see is they should have made the headphones spring loaded to cup the ear tighter. I would recommend this over the Vive 1.0 or the Oculus Rift by far. It takes away most of everything I was disappointed in with both of them VR sets when I tried VR for the first time.

If you're looking for the best looking VR Experiences, this is as good as it gets for the next few years; however, make sure to bring your own audio device, as the built in speakers have issues, ESPECIALLY with the wireless adapter.  Wired, they sound all right via NVidia audio, but crackle and pop via HTC vive multimedia or HTC audio.  The pro is a huge bandwidth hog, so for those looking to supersample at the high end, you're going to be stuck with the wire; the wireless causes crashing.  Overall, the Pro is like Nvidia's RTX series in the sense that it is the best that one can buy, but it's overpriced for what you're getting.

Being a owner of a previous HTC Vive I can say this is a pretty decent step forward in both comfort and quality. The screen isn't a massive upgrade over the previous Vive but it does increase the clarity mainly with text and image sharpness as others have stated. The screen door effect has been noticeably reduced by the resolution as well.For the straps It has a nob on the back which adjust the horizontal tightness of the headphones while the vertical tightness is adjusted by a single strap and the cushion on the back is pretty comfortable.Now for my verdict on the headphones. They sound good (they do not have an overwhelming bass and the mids and highs are decent which I like) this is coming from someone on a HD 700 that's plugged into a high end amplifier from Burson audio (tldr together over $1200 headphone sound system.)Lastly for those who wish to know I'm on a i7-4790k and a GTX 1080 (not a Ti) and it pushes this fine without issues.All of this being said it's easily worth the $800 price tag that's on this system. It might take some work setting it up at first as mine gave me some trouble. However now that it is setup I absolutely love it. If you wish to go straight to the Pro I recommend the bundle rather than buying the regular Vive and then the Vive Pro since you will get the gen 2 accessories. Also if you need help with the setup or have some questions feel free to ask.

If you're getting it for the resolution, it's better for reading text at normal size, which is great for virtual desktop, but the improvement is only subconsciously noticeable in games.  The headset is more weight balanced and better quality.  A downside is when you move your eyes, the peripheral seems more blurry than the original.

Warning! Check your settings in steamVR!! anything below a 1080ti is getting down sampled on the pro! So it will not look as sharp as it should! If you have a good cpu and a 1080ti crank that global supersample setting up to 170% and up (depending on the game) (the Pro also has a firmware glitch causing low bass via the headphones and this is confirmed via htc. A patch should be coming out soonish. So don't evaluate the headphones too much yet). I have a 1080ti and immediately noticed how much farther i can see, it's got a nice crispness that VR sorely needed. at this point we are literally pushing the graphical power of modern consumer tech, this is the best you will get for now.All in all as a previous OG Vive owner, i am enjoying it thoroughly. And the time i will spend in it justifies the price for me personally.Welp i had saved up a bit in anticipation of the pro's launch. (Thanks amazon for the 100$ gift card i had lying around from a previous deal). It is everything i wanted it to be. i can really push the clarity with that supersampling.. like wow i can actually see 10 feet away clearly in steam vr home. No more teleporting up to the tv. Onward is amazing now, those far maps? You'll spot that head poking out now. Do VR graffiti? The paint looks so much crisper, really helps get your thin lining up better. Like sim games? Racing and flying sim users will love this added clarity. The price was... pretty high. But it's my hobby and i have no regrets. Really glad i jumped the gun.I love it so far. I love tech and i love playing with the high end gadgets. If you just want to dabble in vr look at the OG Vive, it's still an amazing headset. If you got some money to blow, then get the pro. It really comes down to personal value and i believe everyone's opinion matters on the subject. For some it is worth it and for others it won't be. Really depends on how much vr gaming you do.The headset is very comfortable, i can not emphasize the need to get it placed right. But once you do it is amazing.

If you play VR a lot, own a vive, and have a 1080 or 1080ti, then the improvement is substantial. I own the deluxe audio strap, and this is far more comfortable. The SDE is much improved - just makes it look so crisp!

A notable improvement over the first generation Vive.  If spending $800 on other things can improve your system and gaming experience in other ways this headset upgrade should be last on your list.  But if nothing in your rig is performance bottle necked, you've got the original Vive with it's terrible strap, and you want to take a deep dive into Skyrim VR, you won't regret doing it with this significantly upgraded headset.  The strap is so much more comfortable, text is very readable, and the ""screen door effect"" fades into the background almost instantly.

Would have been really nice, had there been a owner's manual included. This had a promotion code come with it. I headset was mailed to me on the 18th. The promotion code ended on the 17th. Guess VR not for me, makes nauseous, so am returning. Other than that was a great experience. If you get queasy you might try it before buying it. :)

It's much more intense on the visuals which is great. Text is much easier to make out and it makes the games more immersive. Fit is good as they changed the weight distribution with the re-designed headgear. Hopefully it lasts for a long time as it's very expensive. Will recommend to my friends!

Screen door is gone. All but the smallest text is readable. Feels roughly equivalent to a 1080p monitor. Seems to seal out the light better. The thinner, lighter cable is nice. Running a GTX 1080.It doesn't have an on-board peripheral USB port like the original VIVE did, so USB mods (fans, etc.) won't work without additional cabling. There is a button on the headset, opposite of the volume buttons, that has a funny symbol but I have no idea what it does. It doesn't appear to be documented anywhere.Edit: one USB c port is hidden next to the cable under the foam.

I like the new screens, very clear and crisp.

I'm writing this as someone who already had a totally modded up normal HTC Vive and then bought the Pro.  I tried all the games I am playing, Elite, Skrim also tried VR movies and the steam games like the Valve laboratory. The audio is great.  Google VR with comfort mode turned off it pretty damn awesome. The video/resolution is of course much better.  The new weight and headset balance is fantastic.  Cameras are awesome.  Snug fit, no light and very very comfortable.  I had the better headset and foam face pieces previously on my old non pro vive and this is still a huge improvement in every way. Rating it based on how much software is available or if you really don't like VR anyway seems a bit besides the point.  There is no better headset out there.  It is the best basically.  Yes have a good machine but have a good machine in general or get a different hobby. Don't like paying top dollar? Then don't buy top quality.

I have a large house. The deck is massive. The master bedroom closet is the size of a NYC studio apartment. I own a Tesla.And yet the thing I show guests that amazes them the most, both young and old, is the HTC Vive Pro set up to be roomscale in my mancave.The only pain is having to figure out (or ballpark) a person’s IPD so they don’t get nauseous too quickly.But this is really something. I really hope it doesn’t go the way of 3D TV because there is so much potential here.

I purchased this as an upgrade/replacement for my original Vive that broke slightly over the return time. I play Beat Saber quite frequently and sweat a lot (this is the nature of VR games). During a stream of regular use, the headset began to lose tracking to the point where I could no longer play the game. This was caused by the lax construction of this product. I have had this headset for 1 week.Pros: increased resolution is pretty nice, and the clearer lenses are also pretty nice.Cons: it will break. It's just a matter of time. It. WILL. break.Something of note is that the components of this headset, while indeed inside the headset and protected my the headset cover, the components are exposed inside the headset and prone to perspiration damage. Strangely enough, HTC has removed ""perspiration damage"" from the warranty as a seemingly blatant and shady acknowledgement of the flawed construction of this product. DO NOT buy this headset.

The screen clarity IS marginally better, but not so much as to charge twice the price and not include the controllers or base stations. But the real reason for the lack of stars is that the vive pro would begin resetting itself after about 15 minutes of play. I'm assuming it's a heat management issue as the headset felt pretty warm in places when this happened. It always came back on after a few seconds, but the flash to black is SO disruptive in a VR environment that it makes the headset unusable. I wound up returning mine due to that issue. I have stayed immersed with the original vive for an hour or more without it overheating.

Absolutely not work the price, and resets itself (heat issue I think). Returned and will wait for another iteration.

It took me several days to write this review as I waited for the Micro Display port to Micro Display port adapter that I needed for my laptop.  I started off a bit irked about dropping the HDMI support, but I can't so much hold that against the company seeing as I should have read the specs a bit more carefully.  First and foremost though, this does provide fantastic clarity through the HMD.  I had reduced the overlay super sampling on my Steam Dashboard to 0.7 in order to allow me to raise some super sampling on other games.  The trade off on the original Vive was fuzzy screen quality when selecting my games, which wasn't a big deal.  When I (finally) got the Vive Pro up and running, I thought my settings had reverted as it was as clear as the unaltered super sampling, if not more so!  So...if your only concern is image quality and you will handle everything else, there you go.  As for the downsides, there are several.  The headphones are junk, they pop and crackle like a set of $20 wal-mart bargain binners, they are mounted to the headset in such a way that you can't get them -just right- on your ears, and where they are it actually hinders putting on a good set.  On the bright side, they are so flimsy I can just break them off.  As for the rest of the headset...HTC, how did you screw this up?  The overall pressure equalization is great!  However, the screw that ratchets down the rear part of the head band is trash...you can't get it particularly tight as it simply slides free.  The extra padding on the rear was a good idea, but the thickness of it causes extreme sweating.  I was able to spend hours in the original vive and barely steam the mask, in just a half hour in this even on non-strenuous games I am having to hop out and wipe my forehead to keep from soaking the lenses.  The field of vision was great on the original Vive, even if the god rays from those lenses were annoying.  However, the silly little nose piece on this one actually blocks my view, leaving a solid little bar right between my eyes.  Oh and a final note...the head phones, good luck with those.  They simply stopped working even though my computer saw them and showed it was pushing sound to them.  Turn off the link box, turn it back on, headphones work, start Steam, headphones stop.  I finally found out that turning the link box off after starting steam, then turning it back on made them work until I restarted Steam.  Seriously HTC, you are charging 800 dollars for this and I will have to spend another 200 at least to make it a decent product.  You all should be ashamed of yourselves, everyone that is wanting to buy this thing, don't.  Buy the original headset, it is far superior in everything except the display and costs almost half the price.  If you are dead set on getting it for the wireless capability in the future, just have some hardware experience or wait for the posters to start putting up instructions on how to fix this piece of junk.

This is my first low rating on Amazon.  I was super excited about this upgrade from the HTC Vive to the Vive Pro.  A lot of reviews stated that it was an nice improvement but not earth-shaking.  I decided to go for it the day before they were planning to start shipping them.  I ordered through Amazon on 4 Apr.  I got an email stating that the delivery date would be between 1 May to 16 May, so I decided to be patient and not worry about it.  In a few days, I got an update that moved the delivery date to 18 Apr!  I then started to get excited because it was almost a month early.  I got another update that said it would be delivered on Sunday, 15 Apr and would be there before 8:00 PM!  I was now really looking forward to trying out the new headset and replacing my older one.  As you can see, the buildup and anticipation had me looking forward to its early delivery.  It showed up around 1:00 on Sunday and I had nothing else to do that day but to get this new VR headset working and I was jazzed!  Amazon exceeded my expectations in every way up until the point where I started opening the package.  I could tell that something was not quite right but I remained optimistic.  It was packaged as a box within a box within a box.  Still everything was ok but I noticed that it looked like it had been repackaged, almost as if someone else already had it and sent it back.  There was scotch tape holding the USB and DisplayPort cables together and other small details that looked like it may not be brand new.  There were also no detailed instructions but I figured those could be referenced on-line.  I loaded updated video card drivers and hooked up the link box and headset.  My system would not recognize the headset and I had Error 208.  I researched everything I could and did everything the forums said to do to troubleshoot the error to no avail.  I then started a chat session with HTC support.  The girl was very friendly and ran me through a gambit of diagnostics.  She finally determined that the headset was defective and said that I would have to return it through Amazon since that is where I purchased it.  I was super bummed because there is a 1 to 2 month wait for this item and now I would have to start the process all over again.  I had to repackage it and go through the return process with Amazon.  I am not sure I want to re-order it because of this unfortunate experience.  I would warn anyone ordering this item to hold off until they work out the issues.  I am a deeply disappointed customer due to the fact that I got a defective unit and that there was no way to get a replacement in a reasonable amount of time.  Thanks for reading and I hope you don't suffer a similar fate.

Oh for crying out loud... base station is REQUIRED to use the thing and it doesn't come with one. As a first time buyer of the product there was NOTHING obvious on the description that the thing required extra accessories to function. All dressed up and no way to play until i figure out hwo to get the accessories separately./ Always have to watch for that (missing) fine print.

I got this thinking it would be a huge improvement over the original vive. Its not.  Its an upgrade, but not significant.  I can still every single dot and pixel.  Yes its more clear and some higher resolution but its nothing leaps and bounds.  It really hurts my head too, not sure why, maybe have to play with the adjustments. I think I will wait until VR has reached the next gen.  Right now its fun to experience for a few mins here and there but nothing that I would want t play for hours like a PS4 or PC games.  Has a ways to go before still..  Oh well.

The device just arrived today, this review is from a Vive, Oculus, Odyssey user.The packaging it's pretty barebone for its price, I'm not talking about what it is inside but about how everything is packed, probably thats why I received mine with a scratch in the front... First impressions are so and so, when you get the most expensive headset on the market you expect the perfection, it's legit, but it's not the case, the fitting is very very good, the screen resolution imprevement is very very welcome, but the God Rays are very very noticeable. Color and black in the odyssey are better, but amazing screen anyway (probably just a different calibration)Audio I think it has some problem, it totally lack of bass, I tried to reinstall everything, but it's just very weird, will try again with more time, but the included audio and the 360 audio are very very welcome!!Btw I did a video about it, you can check out at YouTube .com/c/Tyrielwood  I don't think I can share the link here. It's my last video so you will be find it no problem.For this price hard to suggest, I will update my review in the future but for now.. it's a no

Not at all worth the price tag. Being $300 more than the original headset, this horrible ripoff does NOT come with controllers or base stations for tracking. There is not a single reason this should be a standalone product, let alone at the price point it is at. Unless you already have the original vive headset, ordering this is pointless. And if you do have one, it's still not worth it for the extra couple pixels this provides. This product has basically no functionality when bought alone, and right now in order to buy controllers and tracking stations on amazon it costs $700 combined, as the only options are third party amazon pages selling controllers for around $350, showing incorrect specs and no pictures. DO NOT BUY.
