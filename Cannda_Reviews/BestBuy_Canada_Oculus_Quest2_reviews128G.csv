2022-05-18 19:35:29.138552,"This Oculus Quest 2 is just AMAZING. So breath taking. I love how everything is set up so nice and integrated inside the VR Headset. the sound on this is super amazing but if you want the true experience i recommend a good Headset. I use the Arctis 7P+ wireless headset and its nice. the sound, the Dolby and the movements just feels so smooth. i recommend it. the rollercoaster is far my all time favorite, i love how everything is just so organized. movies on this like YouTube, Netflix will blow your mind out the water. connecting to my pc and steam is a huge plus and over 1000 plus vr games . <3 the only 1 dislike i don't like at all about this headset, is the battery life but that's okay with me because its already Off the Charts of being the best headset Of 2022. Nico :)",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.138552,"I havent felt this way since I've played on an N64, back in 1996, navigating through a 3D environment. The Quest 2 is what I've been looking for. I've been playing video games since I was 4. Started on Atari 2600. I own a variety of handheld games and consoles. The Quest immerses your mind into a fantasy world of your choice. By far the best VR game I have played is Resident Evil 4. You can also watch movies on it with Amazon Prime, youtube VR, Netflix apps. You can adjust how big you want the screen to be. You can remote connect to your PC/laptop, access a web browser and there are facebook and instagram apps you can install just to name a few. I carry this thing on me like a cell phone. When I'm stuck in traffic I'll pull over and watch a movie, catch up on life, play some games all while chilling in the back of my scion XB (windows are tinted pretty good. DO NOT PLAY OUTSIDE IN THE SUNLIGHT as it can damage your device. I often spend time in random metaverses such as Facebook's Horizon, Alt Chat, VR chat and hang out with random people.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.138552,"When you watch someone play a game on the oculus you’re like “oh nice” but when you turn it on it feels so real and there are tons of free games that are so fun, there are places where you can be one person and another one in the next.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.138552,"It’s impressive how much it can offer for such a low price. Have issues like low resolution screens and even lower resolution offered to us when playing games or workout apps to the point that I was thinking if person in front of me didn’t just came out of Minecraft and trying to teach me how to break blocks with gloves. Sometimes guardian was following me instead of being in one place.. very frustrating. More and more things that are bad like small Field of view or not intuitive adjustment for lenses that are also getting foggy extremely quickly for me. Nevertheless that might be like nothing to many people. I could live with all of that because the thing is incredibly powerful and outstanding for the price with hands training, mixed reality, holograms or just flexibility with the chip already inside that can handle a lot. I just couldn’t find time or space so decided to return. Overall I would feel bad to give it less than 5 stars. Well deserved.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.138552,"Honestly, I bought my Quest 2 off of a limb, I wanted the PS5 but at the time it was hard to acquire so I ended up impulse buying a Quest 2, I do not regret it one bit! I think one thing that I overlooked was that you have to try to fit the glasses in the Quest 2, which is difficult for me because I wear a large frame, or wear contacts. Initially, I used contact lenses to see while using the Quest 2 but after a while it bothered me that I always had to put my contacts on every time I wanted to play because I don't like wearing contacts. One day I was doing some google searches for an alternative and VR WAVE was there to answer my questions! I sent in my prescription for VR WAVE lenses and I have been playing nonstop since! They give you a whole kit to test the blue light through the lenses they send, a card with your prescription on it so you know its your pair, a case for safe traveling, and lens cleaners. They were as much as regular glasses and I don't regret the purchase.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.154173,"One of a kind experience at a much lower cost than the similar alternatives. I would recommend this product to anyone that enjoys gaming, is looking for a way to get some light exercise at home and in a fun way, or is just interested in experiencing something new.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.154173,"This is the best VR headset out there. Easy to set up. Lots of fun for all ages. If you are brand new to VR, try to ween your self on to it, playing more and more at a time. If not, you could get motion sickness.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.154173,"About 7 months back I purchased Oculus Quest 2. The headset's build quality, resolution and technical specs are perfect. However, I did not enjoy the VR experience initially since I wear eyeglasses and it's really annoying to wear glasses while using a VR headset or wearing contact lenses! But during the Christmas holidays, I came across a cool thing! It is a prescription glasses for Oculus Quest - 2 by VR Wave. Out of curiosity I explored it further and finally ordered a pair. It comes with a EVA case, adapter and of course prescription glasses! Its adapter perfectly fits upon Oculus Quest 2 lenses (installation of VR Wave prescription glasses was super easy!). Also, the adapter comes with the tiny magnets to hold the prescription glasses. After that I simply placed prescription glasses upon it. That's it! The prescription lenses made my VR experience super smooth. Now, I don't need to worry about obstruction of eyeglasses and I can truly enjoy the VR experience. The VR Wave prescription glasses come with Anti Blue light coating. It really helps avoid eye strain and fatigue after long usage of Oculus Quest.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.154173,Excellent  play is very good.  I like . Is good for the kid and adult,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.154173,This is unlike any gaming experience I’ve ever had. I am more in awe than i was with my first NES system as a kid. Hands down one of the most awesome electronic purchases I’ve ever made. We bought it the day before thanksgiving for Christmas but couldn’t wait. We opened it that night. NO REGRETS!!! The entire family from my 4 year old daughter to my 80 year old dad had a blast on Thanksgiving. Plus we got a $50 gift card that paid half of another gift we bought the same day. BUY THIS!!! If you are on the fence you won’t regret it.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.435358,"First off the image is NOT completely clear....images are still tiny bit blurry....A new technology should also protect our precious eyes...NOT damaging it...just after a few minutes of use I noticed a slight headache...Eye strain is THE MOST important issue with VR that needs to be solved.

second of all, oculus gets foggy..i have to clean the inside constantly so I can see clearly.

Thirdly..it weighs a lot on the head...it does not feel comfortable on face. it should not feel so heavy on the head.

And lastly, a few free games would be nice..without creating these annoying accounts and paying for some sample games....I was NOT able to enjoy one single game....",2,2
2022-05-18 19:35:29.435358,"Super easy set up, but you currently have to have a Facebook account in order to use it. The packaging is uncluttered and takes very few steps to get up and running. It's quite comfortable for a computer strapped to your face, but be aware that you can find yourself leaning forward and putting more strain on your neck. I know myself well enough to not play some of the more nausea-inducing games, but it is definitely a very real personal issue to think about before buying. The visual quality is fantastic and you really feel immersed in game! I'm so happy with this purchase and look forward to more ""large world"" games to play on it. It would be nice if it had foot sensor to use for dancing games etc. and get a better workout. Headset requires charging after a few hours. Controller last much longer, haven't died yet.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:29.435358,"Gotta say I'm pretty impressed with my oculus probably the most fun iv had with gaming in years with most AAA titles not living up to the old standards I've decided to look elsewhere for entertainment. Boy did I find it with hour's already sunk into blade and sorcery,Boneworks & of course I had to try beat saber and yes I did enjoy it xD  iv tried all these titles on airlink and link cable so whatever you favor will work.  But all in all if smashing heads or choping blocks don't interest you iv also just downloaded half life Alex you can see my live gameplay and updated review on my twitch stream ALargeCupOfJava",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.435358,"I was a little hesitant to purchasing this since I had never experienced anything related to VR and I've gotta say the Quest 2 is amazing! If you're like me who never experienced VR and want to try it for a good price look no further. Very beginner friendly and tons of fun games and apps on it. Overall amazing product and would strongly recommend!

Pros: Good Value

Cons: Locked to Facebook Account",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.435358,"The oculus quest 2 is the perfect Gaming device, it is portable (mostly) and it being wireless is a definite plus I must add. The realism you experience while using the oculus is literally insane and unimaginable. The quest 2 is a must get for sure.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.435358,I love my oculus. Instantly when you put them on you go into a totally different world. Its really hard to expin with words how amazing this product is. I got one for me and my sister. I love it,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.435358,omg this game is great i brought this as a gift for my 8 year old son an i think i play it more then he do it’s really fun it keeps me on my feet for sure an it’s worth every penny,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.435358,The Oculus 2 VR is hands down a great gaming experience. We are moving into the Meta Verse without looking back. I would recommend the product or maybe two for the family !!!!!!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.435358,"If your looking for an immersive experience playing games, movies and even browsing the inteenet this is the device for you. Trust you will be happy with your purchase!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:29.435358,"I love this!!!! My only regret is not getting it earlier. I put off getting a VR headset for way too long! I finally decided to go for the Oculus Quest 2 mainly because I liked the idea of needing to be tethered to a computer or a console and some games can even be played without an internet connection! So I can pack this little guy in a backpack and play anywhere anytime! The very first game I purchased and played was Beat Saber, which I had been wanting to ply for a long time. I’ve only played a few other games, but the experience of VR is incredibly cool! It’s completely different from playing console games with a controller in front of a tv!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.669677,"Great product. Definitely the best stand alone VR in the market today. Have games for all ages, and was a hit in gatherings/parties. 

Casual Use 5/5- fun party games. (Plank Experience, boxing etc.)

Competitive 4/5- good competitive games like Pavlov, Population One, Echo VR. Deducted 1 point due to early game lobbies being full of kids, not a big deal for casual Play. 

Fitness 5/5- surprisingly a great workout equipment. Games like the boxing game, and other workout games gets you sweating and moving. 

Overall, great purchase and definitely the best standalone VR",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.669677,"This oculus has provided me a home theater, a fun workout machine, and an immersive experience I love it so much and use it everyday even at work",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.669677,Got this for my grandchildren for Christmas and they love it !!!!  It was the life of the party and i can't wait to get one for myself lol !!!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.669677,Ohhhhh boy the bes Christmas gift a ole lady could receive. I am 62 and in love this thing keep me moving and up half the night lol .,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.669677,"When I got a gaming pc back in October, there was one thing missing that would've made my experience way more awesome and it was a VR headset. I heard a lot of bad stuff from Oculus and Facebook, especially refurbished products. This came in brand new and working like as if it was never used! Everything from setup to linking on my PC and has fanstatic visual quality. I haven't been so amazed by technology since the Wii came out and this was a lot of fun to use and has plenty of games for the PC via Link cable and the quest itself. I highly recommend this storage space if you plan on playing for Steam or just solely for Resident Evil 4 VR.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.669677,This is a great product it is easy to setup and was easy to biy games off the oculus app,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.669677,Great VR game! I purchased two Quest2  Oculus  gaming systems. I play with my family,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.669677,This thing is amazing worth every penny just go a head and buy it.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:29.669677,The package was hit but luckily the product is fine and works well,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:29.669677,My kids love thier new VR Headset and we love to play it too.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:30.325773,"As for all the affordable yet just about powerful virtual reality headsets I’ve been searching for, the Oculus Quest 2 has a fine line of not having cheap quality material for the headset. The revision of the Oculus Quest 2 not only changed the standard storage(used to be 64GB) to 128GB, but also offers a new silicone face interface that provides a little more comfortability and prevents any sweat from entering the fabric of the Oculus. All for the same price of $300. Any extra peripherals or equipment for the Quest 2 is up to you, but the Oculus Quest 2 is a great budget friendly Virtual Reality headset that (possibly) money could buy.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:30.325773,"After having a Samsung Gear VR a few years back that would overheat and draun the battery quickly, this was my first real dedicated VR purchase.  So far i have enjoyed the experience.  I wear glasses so i was concernened it would be uncomfortable or blurry/out of focus but the headset is very comfortable once everything is adjusted.  There are different focus settings for those who wear glasses. I also purchased the upgraded head strap and a pair of headphones which i highly recommend.  The setup was easy and interface is pretty good.  Lots of content and games to choose from.  The battery life has been decent and overall i am happy with the purchase.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:30.325773,"I would actually rate this about 4 1/2 stars if I could. This is a ton of fun, both for me and my kids (8-14). The first won I bought had a pixel out which showed a line down the screen. Swapped it out at a store with another new working model. It's very easy to setup and there are some great games from oculus. The Vader Immortal ones are awesome! Beat Saber is a great workout. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it's very easy for the lenses to fog up with glasses on and the videos and graphics are not quite HD just yet. Granted this is a ""budget"" standalone VR system, but still noticeable for a gamer like me. Highly recommended though.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:30.325773,"This is the best blend of price/performance in the VR space right now. Coupled with the fact that it's wireless, doesn't require the use of an expensive computer (with a pricey GPU), and is 1/3 the price of the Valve Index, makes this a no brainer if you love VR! that said, it has it's quirks. The seal on the face shield keeps in a ton of sweat, which fogs up my screen. The battery covers on the handles tend to come loose (Electrical tap is your friend). Also, there is a small persistent blur that I didn't notice till after the headset was past the return window... It's a clear win, but it could have been perfect with a little more product development!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:30.325773,"It is a very fun device to play. Totaly makes you feel like you are in the game or the experience. It does take some getting used to. Did a roller coaster simulation and while it was very fun to watch it did make me feel nauseous. You see all the movement but you dont feel anything. Makes your brain confused!! Still after some time you get the hang of it and its not so bad. Its still a fairly new tech and game developers havent quite mastered making it look like an xbox or Playstation game, but give it time and they will, some of you will remember atari...it can only get better, and for what they have I'd say its pretty dang good.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:30.325773,"You will know once you try it.

It out performs the PlayStation VR in my opinion, the controls are snappy, and the audio built-in to the headset is nothing less of amazing.

You could connect this onto a PC and play pc be games vía wifi or a cable link. PS you need an expensive wifi six router if you wanna do this. The good routers cost around 250 bucks. Still recommend.

This product is perfect if you don’t want to have issues with wires, don’t have a powerful pc, wanna play in your backyard or at a park, and have a unique  VR  Experience.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:30.325773,"The oculus headset is a good item to get.It is really fun. You can use it to work out, play and learn. There are some problems to this item. When im making my gaurdian when i try to make a big gaurdian and make it around the items in my room It keeps making me turn to a stationary gaurdian instead of a roomscale. Also, when I take a break and set my oculus on the ground, then return to pick it up, it says the tracking is off. Then, I need to quit the app but it wont turn my controllers on nor allow me to quit. So, I have to restart my oculus. Other than that, the Oculus Quest 2 is a great gaming system to have and I recommend it.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:30.341655,"This is great for so many reasons. You can do so much on this - games, tv, work, and chat.  It's great for all ages but would recommend doing your research because there are so many things you can do with it - however, you have to purchase games online so look for deals. We saw there is a 2 week return option if you play a game for less than 2 hours, which is nice.  This is used by our family between the ages of 5-47. Headset fits all of us and can be adjusted although we may look into additional add-on to get the best fit. Still trying to figure out best way to use if wearing glasses. Only downside, wish this were more cost-effective.....handle with care.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:30.341655,"The item arrived on time, no delays. The package was well done and felt very safe for what was inside.

Connecting the headset to Wi-Fi and starting up + playing a game was like breeze. There is no detailed user manual but there is a start-up document inside the package. There is a small booklet which explains about the headset but I am not sure if that will help to deal with any problems connecting to your internet and playing games. But there are a ton of resources online to assist with this

Overall I am giving it a 5-star rating. The experience is amazing, although it could be a little stressful to the eyes and will get used to it after couple of times.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:30.341655,I bought this VR headset with pretty low expectations. My daughter wanted it for her birthday so I got one today and set it up for her. I could immediately feel the quality of this device and when I put it on and went through the set up for her I was blown away at the imersiveness... and that was just the set up. We got in to it and I found the safety features were amazing. I am happy that my girl wont be walking in to a wall or bumping in to objects because the system wont let you. Well worth the money and I immediately went online and purchased another one for me and my son. Major take away here is that this thing is Amazing.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:30.856899,"Ever since I purchased and used my Oculus Quest 2 for the first time, I've had no problems and it performs the way it is supposed to. The headset and controllers all feel great and I really like the silicone cover that they provide because it doesn't suck up all the sweat that leaks from my head. Quality is amazing as it was described and every time I play a game like vacation simulator or beat saber, I am very immersed and having fun. There is only one major downside that is related to the head strap which is the eventual pain in the back of my head when the headset is on too long. This is solely due to the plastic strips that tighten the back strap which dig into my head (this is where it is useful to buy a 3rd party head strap to help).",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:30.856899,"Over all it’s a great experience. Hardware is built great and efficient when it comes to how much tech is crammed in a small piece. Learning curve is low-mild if you consider your hand and eye coordination to be good. To avoid motion sickness start with easier games and build your tolerance. If you wear eye glasses, you’ll have to make due with blurry vision unless you pick up 3rd party head piece. You have about 25-30 mins before Headset become uncomfortable. Head seats last about 1.5-2hrs depending how intense the game is. Be Prepared to dish out Facebook info and a healthy amount of cash for games. Don’t get discouraged, different games are on sale everyday.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:30.856899,"I've purchased two of these devices and they are a hit in my home. I have five children that use the devices and they have a blast. 

I have special needs children that are able to use the device. It's very durable against accidental drops and easy to figure out how to use for playing games.

Lot's of free games to choose from and great games that you can also purchase.

I haven't tried everything out but I did see where the device's can invite friend's to join games through Facebook messenger.

I'm sure I'm forgetting something but I would definitely recommemd. It's a solid investment if you have gamer children like mine.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:30.856899,I've been reading about VR since the early Rift days and of course seen it concept within movies so my expectations were quite high. As earlier versions required a PC with just a little more graphics power than I possessed it was always just out of reach for me. This stand alone unit EXCEEDED my expectations! You are literally immersed in the situation presented to you. The fact that it can also be connected to a worthy PC to play VR games on Steam is a major plus. A mandatory Facebook account may be an anti-draw for some and a 2 hour battery life per session could be improved upon (more battery = more weight) all I can say is well done Oculus! Wonderful product.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:30.856899,"The Quest 2 for the price is well worth it and a great first VR experience. It has a lot of flexibility going for it given you can use it wirelessly, even when playing PCVR games (get the virtual desktop app for this). I really don't have much complaints. The strap that comes with it isn't great, so make sure to look around for good 3rd party options.

The only major consideration I recommend keeping in mind is how you feel about facebook and privacy. That being said the facebook account requirement *should* be disappearing soon.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:30.856899,"I bought this product because I saw an ad on Facebook and it looked like a fun way to get some exercise. I am not technologically savvy and I didn't know much about it. I do very much enjoy the machine and use it with one of the exercise apps that I purchased. 
I just want to point out two cons about it: 1) you by force have to have a Facebook account in order to use it, 2) it is very heavy on your face while using it--I can't imagine that's good for things like avoiding wrinkles and lines. This forces you to do whatever you can to strap that thing up right. I hope Facebook can work on creating a lighter machine that doesn't put all that weight entirely on your face.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:30.856899,"Its absolutely terrible. I hate it so much. Im just kidding, I love this device so much and is totally worth every penny. it is a MUST BUY and will definitely recommend to everyone I know!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:30.872784,"Required some tinkering to get it working right. Fot first time customers, I recommend experimenting with different areas and headstrap adjustment until it is optimal. Remember to make your playspace bright, I find that sunlight works much better than lighting an area. At certain times, the Oculus seems nearly unusable because of how buggy and slow it can be. But to get the full experience, I highly recommend getting a link cable, and don't be daunted by the high price, plenty are available in different connections and cheaper prices. If you plan playing for long periods of time, I heard the elite strap is worth it.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:30.872784,"The graphics on certain games are good enough it really does feel like you're in a virtual reality. Then you have games that are very arcadish and feel like you're in the early 00s. Its a fun experience at first but if it weren't a gift for my kid then I don't think I'd ever spend the money on it.

The games are expensive, you're integrated with Facebook and so like everything with Facebook it almost forces you to be social. You can not turn off friend requests so its a bit harder to keep up with what your kid is doing on the oculus aside from if you set it up on your phone then you can monitor texts and friend requests from the app without needing access to the headset.",2,2
2022-05-18 19:35:30.872784,"I have always been a gamer, but I was skeptic of VR since the technology wasn't great or you needed a wire plugged into the device. I finally decided to get the Oculus Quest 2 and I can say, VR has gone a Loooong way! It was way better than expected! Battery lasts about 2 hours (about 70 if you are casting video to a TV), being a stand alone that needs no cables makes the experience much better. I even had my wife play and enjoy playing even when she usually doesn't like videogames. The downside, original accessories are expensive, the game selection is still limited, and you are forced to use a Facebook account.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:31.575481,"The whole family enjoys gaming on this, from the youngest to the oldest.  It goes beyond traditional console-controller gaming and gives more interesting, well-designed experiences.

I hate that it requires a Facebook account to work, but keep in mind that you can create a Facebook account without any personal information besides your email and your billing address.  You only need to the install the Oculus Store app, you can leave the Facebook app off your devices.  The Oculus experience is wonderful in single-player mode.  It's an escape - I don't want anyone else in there with me.  Keep the social garbage away!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:31.575481,"I bought the first one two years ago! This device is AWESOME!!! I’ve bought 5 in total for birthday and Christmas gifts for my niece and grand children. We have so much fun together! There are so many things to do together with them even though we don’t live near each other! We fish, kill zombies, go on trips around the world, explore the universe, oh and we play a lot of Beat Saber! The only thing that I recommend is buying another head strap and the Oculus Link Cable for continuous play, it’s well worth the $80, other than that, this is a high quality piece of equipment! You should absolutely get one. Or two!!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:31.575481,"I was blown away from the moment I was setting up the oculus. That itself was mind blowing because it was my first time using a legit VR device. This isn’t like those VR in arcades. I’ve had this for months and i have yet to buy a game because I’ve been enjoying the scenes of 360 video on YouTube and any videos with VR compatibility. The only thing i can say is that im always busy, so i don't really have a lot of time to use it, but when i do, it's never a dull moment. Games are not expensive as console games. My favorite part is that it really does seem like your there. It’s mind boggling. A great pass time.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:31.575481,,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:31.575481,"Easily the best VR headset on the market at the moment for the price. 

The visuals are amazing, the build quality is excellent, the controllers feel intuitive, and the overall experience is one of a kind. 

Coming from a Rift S, this is a massive upgrade in every way. For one, the fact that you don't have to deal with wires even if you are playing PCVR titles is excellent. Also, the extra features such as 120hz and hand tracking are the cherry on top.

Lastly, if I had to name my main complaints, then it would be the battery and the strap. The battery life is only about 2 hrs or so if you are only gaming. As for the headstrap, it's not the most comfortable out there and it doesn't stay in place very well. Luckily, there are plenty of aftermarket headstraps with batteries that fix both problems simultaneously (I bought one myself).",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:31.575481,"Took a little while to get used to, but after a week or so the motion sickness sent away. Now I can use it for hours and still feel fine. Good range of games are available, and the 3D effect is amazing. If you attach it to your PC you will need at least a GTX1070. I tried using it in a machine with a GTX970 and it was not good. My other machine with a GTX1070 managed to get decent frame rates. Is a little heavy at the front and you might want to add a weight at the back to offset. I know you can buy an official Quest one, but I found an old Walkman gathering dust that fit the bill perfectly. Overall I highly recommend this, especially as it is so much cheaper than the alternatives.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:31.575481,"I've messed with some VR headsets that you would use for your phone, but this was definitely worth saving up for. I've wanted to get VR headsets in the past, but they required the room to be set up with motion sensors. But now, the Oculus has become advanced enough to not need any extra sensors to install, and it's super portable and easy to use! I've been having so much fun using it and interacting with friends from afar. It's an extraordinary experience that immerses you into a virtual world in which you can connect with those from different parts of the globe as if they were in the same room as you.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:31.591131,"Thought the Oculus was going to be a gimmick, but after finally trying one for several hours I was sold.
Besides games there's a lot of other things you can do with the Oculus. There's 3D movies, 360 videos (concerts, rollercoasters, etc.), virtual art and a number of productivity type apps. Virtual art is similar to the old school view masters. Plus, you can also create you're own virtual art with a number of apps.
There really is more to the Oculus then just games and what they advertise for.
The Air Stream does work well over 5G Wifi, if you don't want to run over a dedicated cable for PC/Steam type games. Yes, you can play Steam VR games, if your PC meets the Oculus requirements.",5,5

The exercise you get while fighting martians or boxing up close, in the ring with #Creed. It is pretty mind blowing. It impressed me so much that i bought some meta stock. What they plan to use VR FOR JUST IN HEALTH care, 300+ a share will be a distant memory. #meta 
Well worth the money, very well made.I didn't even buy any accessories because it came with everything you need. Games are ever growing.
If you arent into activity games just using the meditation and breathing offerings via you tube VR will make you next level zen. I recommend this if you have the moolah.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:32.215955,"Right now, Oculus is the leader in virtual reality. 
The headset is a little heavy (17.7 oz), preventing users from using it for long periods of time. That being said, some nice features are the ability to use Netflix, Google Search, YouTube and a bunch of other free 3-D content. When VR starts to develop more, look out for headsets replacing just about everything visual, including big screen TVs.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:32.215955,What an amazing experience you will get with this oculus headset. Travel the world and never leave your living room. Battle aliens and zombies. There is some thing for young and older like. I have never been a fan of video games. But when we saw this headset we decided to give it a try. My wife and I are hooked. Amazing. We showed our uncle who is 78 and he bought one too. He loves to travel the world from his recliner. With that said I can’t give it five stars because of the customer service. These headsets are fragile and break easy. If you drop it you will be getting it repaired.  The Oculus warranty is basically no warranty at all. If something happens to your headset on the sea you might as well buy a new one. Now with that said getting the Best Buy warranty is a must! It should be required when you buy this. You can basically just walk in  and they will replace it no questions asked.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:32.215955,"We love love love these headsets! We bought two to help beat out the winter and covid blues. Between the escapism, exercise games, wellness and mindfulness and the puzzle games we are in love.

It’s a great way to leave your space for a little. You can see the world, hang out with friends and just live unrestricted.

Love this so much.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:32.215955,"Very fun! I play it almost all the time now! 
   Even better that it encourages me to exercise more and more. I won't even realize I'm starting to tire till an 1hr in. 

   Only complant that it only has a 2 hour battery life so having an external battery bank is a must buy to play longer or buy the extended battery strap for the Oculus for another Hundred. 
   
   Also not alot of VR games in the store but I'm sure they're working on it. I hear that if you have a PC, you can hook it up to the VR and buy compatible games off the Steam Store or you can buy the Virtual Desktop and link it to your Steam. 

   Either way, not a regretful purchase, I'll be playing till they make VR even better.",5,5

2022-05-18 19:35:32.215955,"For the price, you cant beat it, battery life could be better but the headset needs to stay light so the capacity cant be too high, when supported it can do 120hz very smooth gameplay, dont use it too often becuase kf school and work but when i do i have a great time and i burn calories doing so. If your looking for a great budget VR headset buy thi, 128 gigs is more than enough and display quality is also pretty good too. Controller tracking is on point ans setting boundaries is very nice so i dont break my TV (which i almost did playing boxing). Overall very good and im happy with my purchase",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:32.215955,"Awesome device to play with friends in VR. I’ve gotten only Beat Saber to play so far and it’s fun as an easy quick cardio workout and also fun with friends in multiplayer. You’re able to watch Netflix in a virtual room so that’s convenient when you don’t have a tv in your room and just want to watch something without holding the device like a tablet. Hopefully they come out with more fun games. Only downside is having to buy all of the games especially when a game has several add on bundles, but don’t forget to get a referral code form a friend so you both have at lease $30 to spend on games.",4,4

They were so excited to open the Occulus to play it, we let them open their gifts the night before.  The kids played all night on the consoles until the Occulus needed charging.  My husband and I tried them out, and the graphics made you feel as though everything was real and not in the game, so much so that my husband ran right into the wall lol.  My family rated the Occulus’s a 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to any family to enjoy a lifelike experience within the comfort of their own home.",5,5

But she has experienced some motion sickness with it so she has to put parameters around they length or time she uses it!  I used it for a short period of time and had no motion sickness at all so it probably varies from personal. To person!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:32.232086,Idk if its just me. But I saw blue tint.. and also it was blurry as heck for me. I doubt that I need glasses. Its maybe because the screen is bad quality. I can see my iPhone 12 screen perfectly. Its a bummer bc I wanted to actually stay with it. And watch movies and play around in it. Also I couldnt download horizon worlds idk why. Which is weird. Sadly im returning it,2,2
2022-05-18 19:35:32.752801,"So hardware is amazing enough but the software to protect yourself from punching things in your house is impressive. The ability to make safe zones ( guardians ) and it remember it is awesome. Don't expect life changing graphics for the games in the Oculus store but the fact that it is a stand alone unit that can do all it can is bananas. I suggest to buy the connection cable same time as purchase is you have a vr ready PC. That's where that 5k vr ready graphics come from.

Easily worth 400$ if you want a change from conventional gaming. It's designed to be very social so I hope your friendly",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:32.752801,"Found it easy to set up once I figured out how to hold the controllers, lol, Old guy here (54). The build seems pretty solid but I'm sure damage would occur if dropped from 5' face height. Fits comfortably with the wide elastic adjustable band. Two options for sealing it to your face, a soft rubber and the foam. Eyeglass extension provided which I found to be useless. The virtual world at your home screen is stunningly beautiful with different options from space, to cabins, to city, to a swamp. My favorite thing is teaming up with my kids to play a round of golf and they live in different states but it literally feels like we are together o. The course. Need to work on my avatar.

It doesn’t require a PC, you just boot up the Oculus app on your phone and log in, connect it to your headset, and you’re ready! It’s also not too expensive, it’s the price of an Xbox One or PS4 unless you’re getting extra storage. Purchasing games also is pretty easy, you just give your payment option and buy the game through the store either on the oculus or on you’re phone. They give you a great refund service if you didn’t like the game as long as you didn’t abuse the system or played for a long time on it. Finally it gives you a wide range of great games and gives you great deals and discounts on a good basis.",5,5

I do wish the lenses had more adjustment, but it's not that beg of a deal. Now to the problem i have with this system. The controllers operate how they should, and are comfortable to hold. With that said. The controllers are the biggest let down of this system, because they are made out of the weakest plastic that i have ever seen on a controller. I have broken the lower trigger mount off on both my controllers. Due to new controllers being out of stock everywhere. Which is a joke in itself. I decided to fix them myself. Luckily i was able to glue the mounts back on with some high streangth plastic glue. In the process i notice that not only is the plastic pathetically weak, there is hardly any plastic holding the mount together. There is no excuse for such low quality, on what is supposed to be a premium system. I",2,2
2022-05-18 19:35:32.752801,"Oculus Quest 2 is great overall. I love it. 

Pros:
1. Oculus Link - need cable separately. If you want to use this feature, you need to turn off the Oculus Air on your headset and on your Oculus PC app. 
2. Oculus Air - need Oculus app on your PC and need to be on the same wifi network. For SteamVR, it is better to launch it on your computer rather than the Oculus Library. If the Oculus Quest 2 is crashing on your Oculus Air, just remove some or all shortcuts from your Oculus Library. It should work after.
3. Wireless headset. No more hitting your cables when you do overhead slashing when playing games that use physical weapons like swords. 
4. We can bring our headsets anywhere as long as there is wifi. 

Cons:
1. Tracking is not too great. Sometimes, the headset fails to track the hand controller properly. 
2. Oculus Quest 2 games aren't that many compared to SteamVR compatible games.

Definitely, buying accessories enhances our experience using and playing games on Oculus Quest 2.",5,5

I am not a big fanatic of video games, but decided to get it for my 16 year old son and 13 year old daughter for Christmas. So far, there's no complains. The only thing is we need to buy the games which are a bit expensive, along with the music package. The kids play with the Oculus for about an hour or more at times. The straps are good, but kind of hard to adjust. I will need more time for them to play to hear, how they feel about it. But I researched couple of other VR before, and so far this was winning. I felt great with the purchase.",5,5

What makes quest 2 the best out of all of these is simple: no cables! You can now perfectly play pcvr wirelessly through this headset using oculus link. In my experience, you do need to be relatively close to your pc for the best connection. I bought this set as I am eagerly awaiting the vr release of one of my favorite games of all time: Resident Evil 4. The fact that this headset supports wireless pcvr and has its own multitude of vr games for on the go is amazing. Excellent product.",5,5

But then a coworker won one at our holiday party and I started really thinking about it.  I've never experienced VR before, and it's been a complete game changer.  I've only scratched the surface with Beat Saber and Superhot VR but there's so much potential.  And honestly, features/specs wise this is some outstanding tech, period.  Not just for its price, which is insanely reasonable given its feature set and the price of its competition.

And in these days of shortages, it's actually obtainable.",5,5

The setup is easy and the games and apps have been enjoyable.  The only thing that I don’t like is that you have to have a Facebook account to use it.  If you don’t mind using Facebook or you can get past it, this is a great purchase.  Also if you are worried about 128GB not being enough, for most people it will be more than enough.  The games and apps are not that large they each usually only take up 5GB or less.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:33.283925,I don't like that I had to make a facebook account to use it. Also there's barely any free games and the free games suck. Also all the games you have to buy to even have fun on this are expensive. It's all about money. You spend over $300 to buy this and you end up spending another $100 in games to play it. The battery life is not very long. So you have to spend even more money to get another pack to even get good play time. Then so far I've found it to be 1 player. I can't play with someone else unless they purchase the same game. So overall I would consider this a money pit!,1,1
2022-05-18 19:35:33.283925,"What can I say, seems like great value to get into VR.

You can buy an overpriced cable and play your steamvr stuff you've always wanted. Product seems sturdy, it is clear, controllers work great.

The power it has for playing games on the headset alone has been impressive though. I have to give them credit on that one, even if it may or may not be spying on me like everything these days.

They say at some point you can unlink it from facebook, that is what I want as I'd like it to be separate and it's own thing. 
So recommended to get into VR unless you have privacy concerns.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:33.283925,"I bought one for my wife for christmas and she loves it, both my children love it 9 & 11 This unit is way more then i expected. The graphics are theme park quality (Think Pandora at Disney) and the amount of games is endless. Highly Reccommend.",5,5

I would say wait to purchase until they fix the kinks in this set and wait for more games. FAQs and support didn’t really help when it comes to forgotten passwords. The only way to fix it is a factory reset.
The  fabric for the head strap is finicky, make sure your hair is down or to the side for use. 
You can’t wear glasses with this device. They sell prescription lenses but that’s an additional cost. 
There is no carrying case with this specific purchase. Again an additional cost. 
Serveral games require subscriptions or additional costs.",3,3

Only downside in my opinion is that comparing this one to the Rift S, which i own as well, is that it doesn't seal as well at the bottom like the Rift does. light bleeds through some. Maybe the next Gen they can fix this so it contours a little better. Other than that whats not to love. I can play Halflife Alyx wirelessly from my PC and not get wrapped up in all the cords. Native Oculus games are installed on the headset so i can play anywhere. Needs a version that includes the elite strap and battery. These IMO are required for comfort and longevity.",4,4

There potentially is a solution into the future where accounts can be made directly with META the new name for the quest company. 

Other than that these are great! They even have a digital fence that if you venture outside of it the headset has cameras to allow you to see your surroundings in your home. Very nice safety feature.",5,5

2022-05-18 19:35:34.986651,Provides tons of fun for the entire family. Easy to operate and customize experiences. A big hit in my house.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:34.986651,"I brought this as a gift for my son. He is 10 and he really wanted this. So we surprised him with it and he was very happy. Like with any online gaming system you have to monitor who they are talking to and who they are playing with. He really enjoys it and so does his siblings. I would recommend playing in a area where you have lots of space because you  will be doing a lot walking around and  moving around. I also would recommend limiting the amount of time played on the game. It is very close to your eyes, so I only let them play for about 20 minutes at a time.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:34.986651,Absolutely love these. So much fun on your own and in gatherings. Everyone has a great time using them.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:34.986651,this is perfect vr. my son is loved. 5 stars for the stors. next time im come back and buy new phone.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:35.439678,The games can be pricy but its worth it! Very powerful device thats a all in one with amazing games,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:35.439678,Overall great system! I was pleasantly surprised to see how far we have come with VR. I was the guy waiting till the tech evolves and get better. I bought this because my father in law got one and my wife and I decided to as well. We have fun playing mini golf and horror games. Wish there were more titles but for what you get it is a load of fun. Just be weary of motion sickness and take your time getting used to it. Take breaks and if you feel sick stop playing immediately. Drinking ginger ale helps with the motion sickness some games give you. Not all games do.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:35.439678,Love it. Glad I purchased it. Many fun games. Wife and I get lost playing for hours at a timeZ,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:35.439678,No complaints from the 13 yr old or the 10yr old! Gonna get one for the adults in the family,5,5

2022-05-18 19:35:35.439678,"VR gaming is a new experience for me so this is not an experts opinion but just a few things that I noticed that needed upgrading right out of the box. The first thing is the head-strap that comes with the VR headset is uncomfortable and does not support the weight of this thing hanging off of the end of your face very well. The next thing is the controllers. The handles are hard plastic and have a slippery feel to them. They come with strings that wrap around your wrists but are pretty much worthless when it comes to keeping the controllers in the palms of your hands. Rubber grips with velcro hand straps work WAY better.  The last upgrade you will want is a pair of earbuds that connect right onto your headset. The headphones will do two things, It will give you a better sound experience in VR and it will keep the noise down so if other people are around they wont be bothered by gameplay. Those are the three upgrades that I would suggest to a new user that will make your VR experience more enjoyable. #1- aftermarket headstrap #2-controller grips with hand straps #3- earbuds for the headset.  These 3 upgrades cost about another 80 dollars but are worth it for a better comfort, safety and overall VR experience.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:35.439678,We have been playing this most of the day and have enjoyed it so much.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:35.908310,"I give the device 5 stars.  It is literally the best purchase I've made recently.  There are plenty of games, but there are also workout apps that make exercising FUN such as FitXR and Beat Saber!  The bowling and racket ball games are fun.  I like that you can play against friends. 

This was the first time I've ever purchased an online order from Best Buy for delivery and it wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either.  They shipped the device via Fedex and was supposed to arrive within 2 days but the shipment was delayed (lost) for a few days.  I didn't get my device when expected but I DID finally get it.  Not Best Buy's fault.  But if you are able to pick up in store, that would be the best option!

Still, great device!",5,5

2022-05-18 19:35:35.908310,"Was definitely one of the best decisions we have ever made buying a present for our kids. It only has a 2 hour battery life so you know they will not be using it for hours on end. It does charge fairly quickly so if other kids are over after the 2 hours you can charge it quickly for use again. 

The only downside is there is not many free games. It’s nice for some of the games they allow you to try the demo version. A plus side on having to buy games is a lot of them are under $15. We have definitely gotten our use out of the oculus it was worth every penny.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:35.908310,"I have only ever used a VR headset twice, once with a rift in a lab and another time with Google cardboard if that even counts. The quest 2 really took things to the next level by not only offering 3D with the 360 experience but also making it portable and independent. I use this headset for productivity, gaming, web browsing, watching movies, and pretty much anything Id use my regular computer for and the quest 2 just seems to be better and more fun for all of these things. And to think they're selling these for almost half the price of a series x or ps5...",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:35.908310,"I bought this for my 8 yr old son for Christmas, only after not being able to find the PS5, and he absolutely loves it! Both of my sons have found this product to be fantastic. and they can play with others, like as playing on PlayStation and XBOX. They haven't told me that they like this better, but I do!! I feels it gives you a different look into games and the games look different. With VR, you are immersed into the game itself and YOU are the player, as opposed to the other gaming systems. It's a wonderful choice and I would recommend this to anyone!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:35.908310,"I bought this VR headset as I’ve been wanting to get into VR for quite some time now, and it has been working well. However, I’ve noticed that sometimes there is an occasional issue I run into with the system. Sometimes when I’m playing a game (both in-system & link cable) and I take the headset off, it will do its normal thing of turning off the screen, but sometimes when I put it back on, it doesn’t turn the screen back on. It’s not very common, and really, it’s not a hard fix. All I have to do to fix it is just click the power button once on the side.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:35.908310,"The Oculus Quest 2 is a lot of fun and the 128gb model is enough storage for the average gamer. It's convenient to be able to play games and explore the world of VR without the need of a gaming PC. However, if you do plan to play on PC or extend the standard 2-3 hrs of battery life, I would highly recommend buying the 16ft Charging/Link cable. The only downside I can think of is the fact that you'll need a Facebook account to link your Oculus to. I know some people are not fond of social media and would mostly pass up on the Oculus due to this factor.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:36.470676,"Got this specifically for linking to my PC for sim racing. I’ve tried 2 different cables with no success. Constantly loses tracking and ruins races making my experience terrible with this product. Don’t get me wrong, when this works, it works really well and it’s incredibly immersive. Because it can lose tracking and interrupt your game at any moment, I have no confidence in this product for me to use it in competitions.

Not only does it lose tracking randomly, it also fails to charge while connected to the pc and in use, even when using the “official” Oculus quest 2 link cable. It will die on you in the middle of a race, you will be disappointed in your purchase.

DO NOT BUY THIS FOR PC USE, if I could refund this I absolutely would.",1,1
2022-05-18 19:35:36.470676,"I purchased this as a gift for my 2 oldest sons. We had a previous Occulus that had to be connected to a lap top and used external sensors. This is such an improvement now that it's totally wireless. They are having so much fun with it. The games are free or very afforable, especially if you catch the ""game of the day"" or specials. They are addicted to a golf game and enjoy checking out venues together like concerts or live NBA games. So much fun! I would recommend this to any new users or as a much needed upgrade for owners of the previous Occulus.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:36.470676,"The device works great; would recommend the rechargeable base; some software applications still need alot of work; and some OS updates do show that an update was needed, or needed again. If however, you want to feel those whirlly butterflies in your stomach, without leaving your home, be sure you have someone near you when you first experience the roller coaster ride.  As the saying goes in a different manner of discussion, but suitable for the 'weak in the knees' person, ""You may want to sit down to hear/see this"".  The Premium Bowling Rocks!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:36.470676,"My son was THRILLED this is all he wanted for Christmas this past year. He is young so must be supervised when playing multi player games because not everyone is nice and friendly but he loves interacting with other kids and playing games. He asked me though if we could sell this one and get the Sony PlayStation one, apparently he prefers the games on that one. Had I know I may have opted to pay the extra $50 to have a better selection. If you’re a gamer you may prefer the Sony, if you like interacting with others than Quest is the way to go.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:36.470676,"Great fun! If you are even as much as considering  VR and you made it this far like I did. BUY IT! you honestly wont regret it, just look into the games you like and get a few. If you have a gaming laptop or pc get half lyfe Alex, if not dont worry, you can play many games on the occulus store app and will play directly from headset no pc required just internet for when downloading game etc. And some games can be played offline once downloaded like saints and sinners, boxing games and tons more. Just bought mine last week and having a blast.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:36.470676,"This VR headset is hard to beat for the price. It is fairly comfortable to wear, and battery life is decent. Good selection of apps and games. It is great to have access to these in a stand-alone package. This headset can also connect to Steam VR on my PC for access to an even wider selection of games, and using it this way gives even better battery life since it is not running the game on the device itself.

Main downsides are 1) the link to Steam VR can be fickle, and if it stops working you need to reboot the Quest, 2) resolution is not the best and reduces the immersion a little, and 3) it's linked to Facebook and requires and account with them. I with there was some actual competition but Facebook/Meta has the low cost VR market cornered.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:36.470676,Had some initial problems. Had to do factory reset.now appears to be working.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:36.470676,"Unbelievable experience. Really entertaining. This is a look into what the future will be, in my opinion. The technology involved in this is fascinating and remarkable. Our 7 year old really enjoys it. And some of the games could actually constitute exercise! Lol. It is an expensive endeavor though. In addition to the cost of the unit itself, nearly all of the games cost money to buy or to play beyond a limited demo. It does take some tech know-how to set up too…and adjustment time to use. Overall, I would say dive in if you have the means.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:36.486528,"Oculus Quest 2 has the hardware and accessibility to be a VR headset for anyone interested in getting into VR. At such a low price point and having the ability to make it your own with accessories, it's a great headset. It has a good library and if you have a computer that can handle VR games, there is an option for that compatibility too.

Note: There are a few cons. 
- Adding more accessories does cause the price point to go up. Things like: case, new head strap, games, etc.
- The headset is front heavy. I'd recommend a new head strap to counter balance the front heaviness.
- My personal glasses don't fit within the headset and I've heard it isn't comfortable to wear them either way. I'm going the prescription lens route, which is more money.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:36.486528,"I have a used HTC Vive and a PSVR, decided to give the Oculus a try and I am greatly impressed.  I found very little distinction between my HTC and PSVR in terms of resolution, but the advertised specs for the Oculus are true and I found a huge improvement, especially for theater mode, where movies pop out like you're in a theater.  It can work with your PC's STEAM games via Virtual Desktop and you can cast to TV via 3rd party apps, it does favor Chromecast, but I did get mine to work with my Firestick.  With complete cordless freedom (for a couple hours of battery life) I feel this console is taking VR in the direction it needs to go.  The downside is the Oculus is owned by Facebook, but it gives you the option of just having an Oculus account.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:37.064290,"I would really recommend this headset for those getting into VR. Everything you need to get started is included. The headset is pretty comfortable and the Quest store has a good collection of games.
The main downside is that the headset is technically wireless, so it will need to be charged after a few hours, which prevents long periods of use. However, you are able to purchase a longer cable that will allow you to use it while charging.
Depending on your budget, you may also need to consider the price of games in addition to the headset.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:37.064290,"This thing becomes useless if you get banned by Facebook censors. I bought an Oculus last year, then my FB account got suspended for three days, so basically it became a brick. Fortunately, this happened during the return period, so I returned it for a refund. I also permanently deleted my FB account and haven’t looked back. 

The arrogance of the people at FB is amazing. They think they can sell you something, require you to sign up for a FB account and then use their arbitrarily enforced community guidelines to make your Oculus useless.",1,1
2022-05-18 19:35:37.064290,I have bought two so far and both of them got messed up after regular usage don’t get me wrong anyone who has played on a VR system knows you’re gonna pop the headset with a controller from time to time it happens but after a couple minor bumps the thing won’t charge for 300 bucks I’d expect it to hold up for as long as a console the first one I bought was past warranty which is why I bought the new one and the new one broke before the 30 day warranty save your money and wait a couple years for a better one maybe then will I try VR gaming,2,2
2022-05-18 19:35:37.064290,"It is a very good expirence, and being able to use without a computer and cables, makes it great if you dont have a powerful pc or you want to bring to a trip or a friends house. But, the price comes with some problems, it says it is 300 dollars, but you will spend around 50 to 100 dollars more in accessories such as the oculus link cable and a carrying case, the one you must buy is a new headstrap, the one included is bad, not horrible, but compared to any other strap it is garbage, so you will have to buy the pro one or a 3rd party one.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:37.064290,"My kiddos love it!  It's pretty cool, but I have to limit their time on it.   While the feel is fairly realistic and good graphics, it can be dizzying.  If the user is not grounded, it's easy to fall over or bang into something with the joy sticks.  I tried it and had (and still do) a difficult time adjusting the headset.  My head is not bigger than average but every time I use it, I have to hold the headset on my head.  The back should be weighted down with something.  Something more like a helmet would be a better design.  As it is, it keeps falling down on my face.  It's not cheap so I feel the headset should fit better.  Also, watch for the recall on the foam inside the headset.  We took it out.  Apparently it was causing rashes to some users.",4,4

This thing is awesome. You can watch a movie as if you in a movie theater in hd, you can join a vr think tank and vr video games are a great way to improve hand eye coordination while having fun and to put the icing on the cake the price of the games are either free ninty nine or very reasonably priced. If your on the fence go ahead and get it!!!! It’ll be a great gift for others and yourself ! Only piece of advice is if you decide to do the dot password do not forget it or you will be forced to perform a hard reset. Other than that I have nothing but great things to say about this I love it.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:37.064290,"My son let me try his and I thought it was so cool that I scooped up the 128gb version when they arrived.
Make no mistake you really are immersed in a different world with these on.
In fact I would say that if you suffered from extreme vertigo to take a pass on these it is that impressive.
The real drawback is in how you approach this item, it is not a game system in the way we are used to and most games are only several hours long. No massive rpgs or open world games such as Final Fantasy or Far Cry for example. The game library is also a bit small compared to consoles.
This is also something you don’t play for an hour nonstop, the sweat factor and potential eye strain are definite issues.
It s however a technical marvel and it really does deliver at this price point.
You may want to read up on Ipd, interpupalary distance, because it has an impact on how well you see the images but it should be no big deal.
No if it just had more games",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:37.080122,"This product as sold is very uncomfortable. The head strap that it comes with is the problem. Anyways, the graphics quality is also not up to par, all games are clearly pixelated, videos on YouTube do not look great either. With that being said it’s somewhat entertaining, if you could get past it, that lightsaber game with the boxes is decent. Anyways for me it did not work out at all and I had to return it. Also, I almost forgot, if you do not have a Facebook account, you will not be able to use this item, which is a severe handicap.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:35:37.080122,I love this thing using virtual desktop you can't go wrong especially for the price to performance here Think about it the old Rift S used to be like $600 and you had to set up all kinds of sensors on the walls and stuff Get this you will not be disappointed other than getting upgraded like the G2 which cost double and not to mention you need a high budget PC with a beefy GPU as well as a CPU to run.  But this as well can be linked up with the link cable which does cost a hefty $79.99. But well worth it to link up and get that extra less latency and highly recommend a Wi-Fi 6 if you're using any kind of air link or virtual desktop.  and from what I hear on the news you don't need a Facebook account anymore to run this unit Thank God...Happy gaming XD,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:37.080122,"Absolutely awesome mind blowing experience!  The Quest 2 is definitely brings VR to the mainstream in terms of hardware and software.  It is easy to setup and a pleasure to use.  The guardian safety software feature is genius.  You can optionally use the headset for pcvr and have a game library separate from the Oculus store if that is what you prefer.

Hardware wise, the headset and controllers feel high quality.  It does not have that cheap plastic feel.  The controllers are ergonomic but are good for small to medium sized hands.  The thumbsticks are a tad small for me and can be a bit larger.  The headset is front heavy and can be tricky to adjust the strap to be comfortable.  The display looks great and has no screen door effect.  The included glasses spacer works as stated if you meet the requirements and you are careful when putting the headset on/off.  The Quest 2 now comes with a silicone cover which is good for hygiene and easy to clean.

While the Quest 2 is good headset overall but there are some caveats to keep in mind.  The head strap is not the best and it is almost necessary to get a 3rd party strap.  The field of view is narrow but not a deal breaker.  Only having 3 IPD settings is not great, a slider would have been ideal.  People with small noses will have a ""nose gap"" that allows light to leak inside the headset which can break immersion, a 3rd party face cover with a nose flap can help with that.  Perhaps the biggest gripe is the Facebook account requirement.  While I understand that there are those who want to use their headset as they see fit, you won't get that when Facebook is involved.

My final thoughts is that I'm thoroughly impressed with what Oculus brought to the table.  The relaunch of the Quest 2 feels like a great deal when they increased the storage to 128gb.  I can already see myself putting a ton of use into the Quest 2.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:37.689144,"I bought the 128 GB unit, and it came wrapped beautifully, with batteries in. I charged it with its charger while downloading the oculus app on a smart phone.

I googled the probllem, and there are many disappointed customers out there! I got the unit at BB fair price, and it was delivered the very next day by Best Buy, BUT I can not see any of the videos, play a game, or do my exercise!

I think this is the best bang for your buck. Coming in a 300, it’s exceptional for what you get. Tracking is pretty good, it’s not wired, and though the display is a little thin compared to list others, you can’t get a deal like this at this price tag except here. Sure, it loses out compared to most other consoles, but who cares when you save 700 dollars and don’t really need the same setups those provide.

The only think I dislike about this console, and the reason I ended up returning, was its system being ran by Facebook. Games I played offered no modding support, and took a lot of work arounds to do very simple tasks that can typically be accomplished quickly by a computer based rig. Otherwise, great system.",4,4

That’s going away in a few months they say. But for now you need one. Which I didn’t have so I created one. And after a week of using it and buying multiple games, they blocked me until I could verify myself. Which was not made easy to do. So I spent a week not being able to use the system until the Finally unblocked me. Read afterwards allot of people had that issue when setting up a new Facebook account.

Oculus has kept that standalone Quest design with the same feature set, while improving its screen, reducing its weight, and — with one noteworthy caveat — making it more comfortable. It’s also dropped the starting price from $399 to $299, making the Quest 2 one of the lowest-priced headsets on the market.",5,5

Streaming the Oculus is easy, unless you're on a corporate network, which will likely have firewall permissions preventing the stream. YMMV

I like that I can use it anywhere without wires tethering me to a computer, nor does it need to be limited to a single room due to external sensor placement. This unit is great used stand-alone, and even more impressive when ""tethered"" to my computer with the Oculus Link cable for more advanced processing power.

Straps are the best they've made yet, and tracking is awesome where it can even draw people / dogs/ items that come into your play zone for both small setups and dynamic rooms with people going in and out. Facebook login and that side of the experience isnt the best but the product itself performs amazingly.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:37.705003,"The Oculus was a last min purchase for my son. He truly didn't ask for anything this last Christmas, but I was certain he wanted it. As the last gift under the tree, it was the best. Talk about tears of joy!
After thanking me several times and after plugging it in, he began to enjoy. The game play  and graphics are amazing. It's so easy to navigate and he quickly became very skilled. I would advise playing in a well lit area to avoid crashes haha. That said, it is one of the coolest new products one the market! We love it!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:38.173403,"It is insane what this headset can do for $299. Sure Facebook/Meta is probably making a mint off my data, but between Amazon, Google, Apple, etc... my data is already out there. I may as well draw some value from it.

I am only playing Vader Immortal (which I got on special) and Moonrider for free and it's great. I plan to pick up RE4 if it goes on special as online reviews for that look promising.

Not much more to say - just make sure you have a space to play. Running into the room guardian is annoying during game play.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:38.173403,Don’t be fooled by HD VR videos.  That is NOT what you will be seeing in these VR headsets. I purchased the Oculus on 3/4/22 and ended up returning it on 3/6/22. Initially I purchase the headset to attempt sim racing in VR as I had heard the experience was something I had to try. Unfortunately I was unable to achieve the clarity of picture I desired even when wearing g glasses which also made the headset more uncomfortable than it is. I read about prescription inserts that could be purchased but ultimately I decided the hassle of getting it to work pretty openly with games that touted VR support and the extra money outlay ($80 for a long USB-C cable?!!!!) was simply not worth it to me. I used the return to purchase a new keyboard and Xbox controller and am happier.,3,3
2022-05-18 19:35:38.173403,"I come from using a Rift S, in all honesty, it was a horrible experience to have the Rift S. At first it was awesome to experience VR but I started to dislike it a lot since there were issues and no bug fixes due FB putting all their attention to Quest. 

Leaving that behind, I think the Quest/Meta 2 is a no brainer if you want to get in VR. It's way too cheap and it works with PCVR and that is very enticing being that for 300$ and 30$ for a cable, you got yourself a pretty darn HMD.

There are downsides and the biggest one for me to get used to is a bit of the strap but mainly the controllers. The previous ones felt more premium for me and were like thinner and made it easier to use for beat saber or other things. I wish we could have the old ones for that matter.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:38.173403,"Awesome little device to pair with my 3070ti and a 10850k, I’ve only tried it over airlink as I haven’t gotten the type c cord to work but it’s still a solid upgrade from the old gen

It made me want to upgrade my router specifically for this. I also don’t think airlink affects your download speeds, more so the local network btw

Using Netflix on it in a room with sleeping people is pretty handy, the speakers are pretty loud to the user and not others as much, and there’s no light like a TV would have from their perspective 

Battery life’s alright, only complaint is I’m not a big fan of what it does to my hair I guess

I would highly appreciate a toggle mode of what they have already for bumping into furniture, where you can see using the front cameras in the dark",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:38.173403,OK when my son first asked for this I didn’t see the big hype about it but after putting it on and experiencing it is absolute insanity. The graphics and some of the games are just crazy. My only complaint is that the head strap keeps moving all the time you always have to keep tightening it and it needs more focusing options.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:38.173403,"Pretty surprised at how good the visuals are. It's a bit buggy with definite room for improvement, but out of the box it's the best value in terms of devices to play beat saber on. Super lame it's connected to FB, but in this day and age it seems you have to make concessions in one way or another to one of the metadata-starving behemoths. It also seems like there's quite a bit of additional content already released and continuing to be released, which is nice that the platform appears to be supported for years to come.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:38.173403,"I saw some advertisements for this product beforehand and even though it came easy to use and play. I would recommend using the beginner game installed to learn how to use the handles. If you are not used to virtual games, take baby steps and gradually work your way up to avoid getting motion sickness. The other issue might be the weight of the headset tires me and my spouse out after 30mins to 1hour of use. Also, I was aware the the headset did come with the silicone forehead since there was a recall not too long ago.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:38.189025,"This was my son's Christmas present to himself (he saved up his money during the past year).  He absolutely loves it!  While watching him play, it seems to be a safe gaming experience (he doesn't crash into furniture).  One really nice thing that I like as a parent about the Oculus is the battery.  From what I can tell, it has a max life of 2 hours before it needs to be recharged.  That means he isn't using the Oculus for hours on end.  (To be fair, he uses a stopwatch/alarm on his phone, so he only plays for an hour).",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:38.189025,"Can two oldies enjoy virtual reality headsets? You betcha! We're not interested in shoot 'em up, fast-paced games, but thought-provoking ones like ""The Room"" are more our speed. There are, however, some cautions that more mature users need to consider:
1) The headset is heavy on the neck. We play standing up and generally forget about the discomfort when engrossed in the game, but later, we feel it in our neck and finger joints. There are accessories for a different head strap that can make the fit better. The Quest 1 ""head fit"" options were better.
2) Those with balance, and motion sickness issues will want to use the seated mode of play.
3) We can generally only get two hours of play per battery charge so we'll be purchasing a battery pack to prolongue our new mania.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:38.189025,"Pros
========================
• Excellent price no matter where you are buying
• Wide selection of different types of games and experiences
• Easy to get started
• Sturdy controllers
• Excellent way to get into VR
• No wires!!!

Cons
========================
• The base strap gets uncomfortable after a short time
• The battery life is abysmal 
• Accessories are expensive
• Connecting to and playing PC VR games can be complicated/confusing

Despite the fact that I have included 4 of each pros and cons I have to say the purchase was definitely worth it - even if I had listed a few more of the other cons. I didn't list the others as you would experience the same cons across all VR headsets (motion sickness, finding the right mask position etc.). I have only had the headset for a short time but I can say it is absolutely amazing - especially if you are a little bit of a geek. 

I have tried more experiences than games so far which is strange because I am a gamer but being able to swim around and learn about sea creatures, float around in the ISS, or walk around the bridge of the Enterprise-D. Not to mention the workout games that keep you singing or where you can travel real life roads.

If you have wondered about VR and are looking for a way to experience it without having to buy a new beefy PC this is it. The freedom of not having any wires or not having to connect to a PC is absolutely amazing. I cannot wait until more of my family and friends get the Quest 2 so we can share the social experiences as well such as watching movies, playing tabletop style games or even multiplayer games together!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:38.610803,"The oculus quest 2 is a good cheap virtual reality headset, connection to a PC, works standalone, and is great for beginners. But beware of 2 things:

1: the head strap isnt the most comfortable thing on the planet, it's flimsy and built for cheap so you buy the more expensive elite strap

2: you will be locked into a Facebook (now Meta) owned ecosystem, whatever they say goes for VR, not what the consumer says, if you are a vr enthusiast who cares about the future of vr, the quest 2 may not be the headset for you.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:38.610803,"After my Rift S saw it’s last day, I decided it was time to upgrade to what most believe is a huge upgrade. I come home, frantically open the box, go to put it on only for my glasses to get in the way. Now I don’t have large glasses, I like them as low profile as possible. I have to squeeze my glasses to uncomfortable positions just to get the headset to fit. Even then, once it’s on my glasses are either touching the lenses themselves or butted up against my eyeballs. The glasses spacer was useless in helping this.

What graphics I could see seemed like a vast improvement over the Rift S, but they seemed to have completely tossed out any consideration for glasses wearers out the window. Now I’m having to look into getting prescription lenses, and spend money I didn’t want to.",2,2

I would also recommend getting the silicon type grips for the hand controllers as they do get slippery when you start to sweat.  

Games are reasonable priced compared to xBox or PS5 games.  

Battery life is ok, running about 2 hours of game play.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:38.610803,"The wireless nature of the Oculus Quest 2 makes this a prime candidate for all VR purchases. The AirLink capability makes it a huge winner. The price is perfect for children and adults alike and, if you have the hardware, running VR games through AirLink is a game-changer.

Do yourself a favor and buy some accessories for it like a portable battery, head cradle, and potentially a better strap. The weight of this device can make it uncomfortable.

Three stars purely because of Facebook and privacy concerns.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:35:38.610803,"Got this because I wanted to try out PC VR gaming using the Oculus Link, and I was not disappointed. As a standalone system, Quest 2 is great for quick VR gaming sessions and content, but I truly think PC VR gaming is where this system shines. It's not perfect, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're using Windows 11 because, at the moment, there are a ton of problems. Also, Oculus Link is VERY particular, and oftentimes requires a bit of fiddling to get it to work. But when it *does* work, it's so, so good.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:38.610803,"I thought the device is still a little heavy, bulky-keep having to readjust headstrap... sound is good, not the greatest; lens still fog up after high activity use (maybe a personal thing) and menu a little hard to navigate; maybe we still have to figure it out and play with more to get a hang of the menus and app download & controls. Freezes a little more than usual but might be my crappy internet. the hand controls are easy to use.  doesnt have or let you add a external memory card. there are alot of cool games and apps you want to try but have to be very selective on what you buy to download or else you will run out of storage fast. not worth the price; but my daughter begged to get one for xmas, im sure we will return it if she doesnt get to download all the stuff she wants..",3,3
2022-05-18 19:35:38.610803,"This is my first VR device. It's a great addition to my exercise routine -- playing FitXr and Supernatural to name a few games.  The device was easy to set up although I'm not a fan of linking anything to my Facebook account. The only problems that I've encountered in the last 3 weeks is login problems -- twice. The solution (a factory reset) was not ideal since you lose all of your data and have to download everything again, which is time consuming.  Customer service for Oculus was very responsive and actually sent follow up emails to confirm that my issue had been resolved.  

I would definitely recommend (and have) this device to girls who don't game.  I bought it as another way to exercise but quickly purchased other cool games too -- who wouldn't love pretending to be a Jedi?",4,4

Granted they only get it from the distributor and there trying to do there job they should at least give you a better understanding of whats wrong with the Oculus Quest 2. But it is a wonderful investment if you want to disconnect from world for a bit,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:38.626427,"Technically it's impressive. Also, for the purchase price, the build quality / is exceptional - though I greatly wonder just how much of the actual price is paid through the value they harvest from your privacy.  But the biggest immediate concern was the battery life.  Like many, I had challenges getting it to pair to my Samsung Note 20 5G Ultra - which has been in the market approaching a year I believe and thus should have been smooth sailing.  But regarding the battery, specifically: that bug caused the headset to have to scan for devices to pair with for a much longer period of time.  The result: by the end of the roughly 45 minutes it took to complete setup, I got as far as just browsing game titles before it shut off with a dead battery!  Definitely not a great first impression.",3,3

Plenty of third party accessories make this an even better experience as some of Oculus's own accessories for this are expensive.

Seriously, don't spend much time with this at first - ease into it because when you take it off you'll feel like you just got off a boat in heavy seas, lol. Playing games like Mini Golf or a puzzle game is a great way to acclimate yourself to the 'after effects'. But it really is very cool and a lot of fun. You and your kids will love it.",4,4

The games are also pretty expensive especially when I have to buy the same game for the 3 Oculus devices myself and my kids have. The free content is amazing though!

(7) First it does have a warning for ages 13 or 15 and up for developmental reasons but I feel if I regulate the use it should not be a huge deal. He loves it. I tried it and I agree the technology of the whole thing is pretty amazing. The picture is very clear and the ability to adjust the focus is a plus. I wear glasses and it does come with a spacer that is needed to fit correctly while using. I have a bigger head and I can adjust it to fit snug and comfy. I would definitely recommend this as an entry into the VR systems. Also this doesn't require a powerful computer like the more expensive units. Only con is it dirtys kind of quickly due to only being available in white. Black would be a better choice for something like this in my opinion.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:39.360718,"Very fun device.  Be aware, however, that if you plan to use this with a computer and that computer is a laptop unless it has a MUX switch so you can switch between the onboard video card and the dedicated video card there are a bunch of hoops you have to jump through to get it to use your dedicated video card.

  I believe this is a problem with the Oculus software because when you start a regular 3D video game your laptop naturally starts using the dedicated video card but oculus does not.  you have to trick it by disabling the onboard video card, restarting the laptop, starting oculus then re enabling the onboard video card.  EVERY TIME you want to use the oculus.  The stand alone experience is flawless but if you want to play steam games or something on a laptop be ready for some extra steps.",4,4

Some games I couldn't even get past the intro before it stopped tracking the controllers or my hands. So many games are marked as free but 99% have a subscription fee.

I probably would’ve returned it if I wasn’t able to buy those extras because it takes me about 15 min to get the headset comfortable on my face. Even then I still have to adjust it frequently because it’s either too tight & starts to squeeze my forehead or it starts slipping down my face. And that is with the counterweight I’m using.

The only negatives is that it seems the battery life is around 2-4 hours of using it( I guess they expect you to take a break for your eyes), charging cable length is short( bought a longer cable), and a new hair concept called oculus hair after you use it( comb your hair after use)",5,5

For the setup I had to restart the unit several times to get it to proceed past a given point. I don't like that it's linked to Facebook, but I could live with that if it worked better. I bought it primarily to use with X-Plane, but it performed so poorly I never bothered to try it with that.  I had high hopes but I am disappointed and will be returning it.",2,2
2022-05-18 19:35:40.672820,"Upgraded from the Oculus Rift (2015 model), and wow have they improved. 
Only downside is I feel like there should be a better way to link accounts from games purchased on PC VR. Example Population one was purchased on Steam, but to play it natively on the O
Oculus Quest 2 I needed to buy the same game in the Oculus store.

Even though it's annoying to have to buy the same game twice, You'd think there would be a way to merge the accounts to get game data linked.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:40.672820,"1. Use Air Link or buy the Oculus Virtual Desktop app for $20
2. Download the oculus virtual desktop streamer app to your PC and set it up
3. Open up the virtual desktop app on your oculus
4. Play any of your vr steam games!

It's recommended that you have a good router as this will be running through Wifi. I have my PC connected via Ethernet and its seamless. I was able to play Half Life Alyx and beat saber on the highest difficulties with no noticeable latency!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:40.688677,"I've been using a Samsung Odyssey+ for a few years, and have also owned an Index. I play a variety of games, including Beat Saber, Fallout 4 VR, Elite Dangerous, Moss, etc, so my VR hardware requirements vary quite a bit. Having an untethered headset that can be quickly taken on/off is a nice option, so I purchased my Quest 2 when the 128gb model was available. I already have a FB account which I've been using for FB groups, so I didn't really care about ""that"" issue.

I've been really happy with it so far. I've played both native Oculus games directly from the headset, and PCVR games through Sidequest. Performance meets my expectations, and I was surprised how decent the built-in audio is. Another bonus is that it fits really well with my glasses on, and I likely won't have to buy 3rd party lense add-ons (unlike my Oddyssey+ and Index).

Out-of-the-box, the headset felt very unbalanced on my head, so I bought a BoboVR strap and BeswinVR halo padding kit. The difference is phenomenal - there are times when I don't even feel like I'm wearing a headset at all. YMMV, as each person' head is a difference size/shape, but this combo is perfect for me and it's easy to install. It also gives me a convenient place to mount an external battery.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:41.235189,"I had the original quest and I like the second in just about every way more; however, it is narrower.  I have glasses, so they get stuck in the headset every-time I lower the head set to take a sip of a drink or pause my game for any other reason.  The load times are great, much faster, graphic quality is higher, and the wifi is faster.  The wifi being faster is a boon, because using it with virtual desktop to play PCVR wirelessly is a much better experience.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:41.235189,"I bought one of these a year ago yet I sadly broke it (completely my mistake) and I just had to get another one. I didn’t think much of VR gaming but once I used this I cannot go back. The value for this device is amazing. There is no other headset like this one, one that can offer great imaging, precise accuracy in movement, and not to mention the speakers that are equipped on it. It’s an all in one package and a perfect first step into the wild world of VR.",5,5

I returned it after multiple attempts of playing games, due to the headaches and motion sickness it delivers! I fly every month for work, I’m very active, in great shape, and never experience sickness like this! It’s hit or miss though! Some people won’t be bothered, but as a heads up it can make you pretty sick and deliver a nice headache. Still a great product nonetheless!",3,3
2022-05-18 19:35:41.235189,This was better than I thought it would be. I thought the price was a bit high but after using it I think it is actually priced very well for what it does. I rated it 4 stars because the two controllers use regular batteries instead of being able to just plug them in and charge them like the headset. Other than the need to buy new batteries for them I have no complaints. I have had to buy new batteries only once since purchasing the product so not too bad.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:41.235189,"I was a little hesitant at first to purchase because I'm not much of a ""gamer"" but my nephew got one for Christmas and so I made an impulse purchase.  I love it!  The game I probably play the most is Beat Saber and love the extra bonus packs.  Wasn't exactly thrilled with the price, but I think it's fun.  Also diving into one of the golf games, which will hopefully help my on the course score, but that is to be determined.  Great for kids of every age!",5,5

Graphics are blurry, you have to hit a sweet spot on the lense to be able to see anything, and not many selections for games unless you use Steam VR. I want to like the Oculus, but its not worth the 300 price tag. Also, fair warning to people who are prone to motion sickness, it can make you feel like you're going to vomit.",2,2
2022-05-18 19:35:41.797555,Bought as a gift for my nephew since he plays mine every time he comes to visit and he loves it. The downside is you HAVE to link it to Facebook which sucks but other than that the games are great and are easy enough that younger kids can play it as well. A lot better than sitting down all day playing video games and some games you can buy are great workouts. The upgraded head set piece isn’t made to well and does crack from excessive wearing,5,5

Understand that I warn you that this will become an addiction like any other drug. You crave that connection with others and do anything to get it, Want to make a best friend on another continent? You can. But know it will make your current life seems pretty boring.

Don't like to be tracked and found out to be doing something nefarious? Well, then this may not be for you then. It is possible to block FaceSpyBook but its not as easy as you would like. I just accept that life is always being tracked, I will get caught someday,,,",5,5

A friend of mine and I watched a TV show together from across the country via our headsets. It’s pretty awesome, except, we both remarked at the end how our heads and necks were hurting from wearing the headset for about an hour and 20 minutes. It’s front heavy, it pushes into your cheeks uncomfortably, and it makes my eyes hurt.",2,2

I lost approximate 20 pounds and I’m loving it. I ditched my PlayStation because of wasting my time sitting down and building fats. Minus 1 star because some oculus devices like my previous  Q1 & 2 may tend to freeze and unresolvable. I bought a Geek Squad for this because they are awesome.,4,4

I added my account for him to play it. I would say as long as you dont post anything that would get you band from Facebook you should be fine. If you do get band it could affect the oculus game play (just a heads up). Besides that its an awesome addition to our gaming collection.,5,5

I just wish it came with some games ready to play. Be aware you’ll be buying games when you get it home. Lots of digital purchases available.  Hopefully more developers will jump on board to get some big-name games in the near future.  You’ll also want a 15’ usb-c cable to play while charging.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:42.356786,An amazing value proposition for the price. Absolutely worth the price. The Meta marketplace is somewhat limited but there is plenty of content if you sideload content via SideQuest and if you connect it to a PC to enjoy full PC VR capabilities. Essential.

I would probably wait until the next headset comes out but overall if you wanna buy this headset you should definitely do it!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:42.372411,"Awesome! Easy to setup, easy to use, very portable, good resolution, no cables needed, works with my PC/GPU for great graphics. The only real negative is the blacks can never be as deep as my original Vive, but no headset will be able to do that in the foreseeable future. Try Half-Life Alyx on both the Quest 2 and Vive so see why that brightness range is so important for some games, even with the Vive's lower resolution!",5,5

I love that you can use it anywhere anytime, no cables, no cameras, no power supply. Works great and has a crazy cool boundary setting

The only thing it’s lacking are some of the games, and an easy streaming option for some of the lower budget tvs on the market.

I would also look into the additional head support. In can be a bit heavy on the bridge of your nose.",5,5

2022-05-18 19:35:43.862923,It's a good headset. Pretty capable. I enjoy using it. But it's ties and ownership by Facebook/Meta are significant black mark on this pleasant device. I don't recommend getting this headset unless you font have any other options. The Meta/Facebook ties are just too big a risk and too big a detriment. Just be prepared to lose your game library at any moment if Mera decides they don't like you that day.,2,2
2022-05-18 19:35:43.862923,"Me and my kids loved it, I love that there is no console or computer required too. Also it is more than just games they have allot of therapy type experiences for it as well which I found awesome. I do wish there was more available for free because allot of the games have to be purchased but they do have a small selection of games for free on the oculus store, overall very satisfied with this purchase.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:43.862923,"Oculus Quest 2 is my first experience with VR. I've had my headset for about two weeks now and I'm loving. When most people think of VR, they think of video games only. This device can do so much more. SlingTV, Netflix, browsing the internet, socializing with friends, and of course video games. These are just some of the things the Oculus Quest 2 can do. I like that this headset is a fully stand alone product. You do not need to high-powered PC to be able to enjoy the realm of VR. However, if you do have a VR-ready PC this device can connect to it as well. The device fits comfortably on my face and the controls are very ergonomic. The Quest 2 also supports hand tracking. This allows some apps and games to be controlled with just your hands. This is one of my favorite features. If you are considering jumping into VR for the first time, this product is your best bet at a perfect price.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:43.878783,"Pretty comfortable, I do sort of regret buying the elite strap for this as an off brand works just as good or better depending on where you get one. The games are populated, I don't think I've joined a single dead game. I'd buy this if you don't have a good PC or any PC at all, but if you do I'd reccomend the Valve Index or something similar. But overall you're getting a good bang for your buck here.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:44.324466,"I was never into VR, but was able to acquire one for free and I was quite impressed.

Good:
- extremely immersive, more-so than I could have imagined
- quality of the device is good
- UI is intuitive

Bad:
- some initial hiccups, wifi was bad at first and had to reset the device...in general, there are some bugs
- resolution and performance of the device can be off-putting sometimes
- game library isn't very exhaustive right now

I would say the biggest con for the device is the games library. If you have tons of friends who also have the device, I'm sure you could have fun with any of the games. If you are mostly solo, you might get bored. Personally, the only game I really play is Ping Pong, which is so frighteningly close to reality. If you are a ping pong fan, then you'll have fun with this device.

Overall: if you got $300 bucks to spend and some friends to play with, absolutely.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:44.324466,This product is awesome. I bought it for my son for Christmas and we are not disappointed. It was so easy to set up and start playing right out of the box. The whole family is having so much fun. It is not just a video game system. You can do so many fun and interesting things. The price is not extremely expensive either like other new systems tend to be. I highly recommend this product for EVERYONE.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:44.324466,"amazing just get it, trust its worth every penny. its so fun but it might need a few upgrades, but its honestly a good bang for you buck for what it is you getting the best deal ever especially if you got a pc its even more worth it honestly, its also good fun for the whole family would recommend 10/10 only down side is the battery not lasting long enough but a simple battery bank can help with that.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:44.324466,Pretty fun little toy. Lots of neat experiences can be found within. Getting a clear image is my biggest complaint. I even have the elite head strap and still some games are fuzzy while others are amazing. Only had it for about a month and my head is still getting used to the motion sickness I get after extended use. Short periodic breaks have been my key to success and I try to play some every day.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:44.324466,"Overall the best experience you can have for an all in one VR, some great games that can really move you, allow you to experience things you wouldn't normally ever be able to achieve. Although I do have to say that its a little difficult to use with glasses, but thankfully Oculus sells third party lenses that just snap on and solves that problem as long as you have your presription for you glasses.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:44.324466,"I was skeptical of VR from the start but have professional and personal interest in seeing what the medium is capable of. Happy to report that the Oculus, so far, is a terrific introduction to the world of VR. There are some slight issues- it's not always the friendliest platform for folks who wear glasses - but the VR works well, it's engaging, and there's a lot of cool uses. Happy I picked I tup.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:44.324466,I wanted to purchase the Oculus Quest 2 last year and was unable to. This year turned out to be a great Christmas with the Oculus! It is such a fun experience and it works very well. I am blown away by the virtual cage VR area that you define and when you poke your head through the virtual wall you can actually see into the physical room thanks to the cameras on the front of the Oculus. Very cool.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:44.324466,This is a really good value for the money and  it is amazing how they have gotten some of these game to run smoothly on this platform. I bought the link with it too and that runs well but there is a audio sync issue. I just can't play beat saber on this over the link cable from my computer but fortunately it is very fun when running natively on the device. I did have significant issues with my first unit. It kept turning itself off mid-use with full battery. I think it has something to do with how tight the headset is though. This one does it too if I really crank down the pro strap but the first one was REALLY sensitive. In my opinion this really is best as a personal device and sharing it with the rest of your family isn't very smooth. It should have an SD card slot but it doesn't. Pricing for storage and excluding this option is exploitative and I have to call it out. Sorry not sorry.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:44.340051,"Great headset, I've had a Vive and Rift before but felt screen door effect really kept me from having a good experience. But the Quest 2 has pretty much solved that problem, I actually feel like I'm in the game and not looking through something at it. Being untethered from wires is great, even when using it with my pc. I have probably used this headset double the amount of time I used the others.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:44.340051,"If you’re not in VR, you’re missing out. Best Buy had the headset and the accessories I needed for a reasonable price. I would recommend buying the elite strap as the stock one is not comfortable for more than 10 minutes. I would also encourage you to get grips for the controllers and a PU foam insert. Spending another $100 for these accessories will turn make your experience enjoyable for hours,",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:44.761858,"For a long time these types of devices were kind of novelty or too expensive...but the Oculus really did that leap that was needed for VR to become what it had the potential to become.  The games are fun, immersive, affordable and it brought party games back.  You would think that an oculus would seclude people but it's actually a great way to have fun and share experiences with the whole family",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:44.761858,"My brother and my son have been singing Oculus' praises to me for a while now.
Having owned the PSVR previously, i was skeptical.
Finally bit the bullet and got one for myself, and have to say it's a lot more fun than anticipated!
The games are, so far, shorter than i would care to pay for, but the immersion is worth the price tags.
All in all, I am satisfied with taking the plunge into VR again",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:44.761858,"Love the VR. Your in another world and you feel like your there. The games are fun. Got the win baseball for my grandson, it is unbelievable. Your right in the stadium and having pro pitchers throwing the ball. It is a great training tool.

I get the best results with overhead light. With natural sunlight sometimes the room barriers are way of. Probably due to the uneven light distribution. The screen can be more sharper but i cannot complaint too much given the 300 dollars price tag.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:44.761858,I bought this for my daughter and myself for Christmas. I already have the PSVR so I thought this would be better for her since its wireless. She loves it! I do like the capabilities it has over the PSVR but it suffers in the game department. Titles are more expensive and their are less of them on the oculus store itself. But if you connect it to your PC through steam it solves that problem.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:44.761858,"The worst purchases ever, your better off buying a PS5 and waiting for their New VR. No real developments or companies investing into it.

The headgear is also kinda heavy so I had to make it tight on my face and after a few mins your eye sockets sore.  Once you take it off you have rings around your face.  I'd be careful with young people as after a while you may be left with damage under your eyes.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:45.217129,The Oculus quest 2 is unbelievably the best! It is so powerful that you feel like you are right there in whatever you are viewing I've had several different types of viewer's but nothing tops the clarity and realistic viewing of the Oculus quest 2!

I played Darth Vader and it is actually pretty good. The only thing is that I wear glasses and when I need to put it on and take the Oculus off I have to be delicate to avoid scratching it. Other than that it is pretty good.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:46.888618,"This is fantastic! Much more than I expected. 3 co-workers have already purchased one after seeing the one I purchased. Games, movies, apps all in one device that transports you to another reality (virtually). I’ve purchased several games for it, but there are many free things to do as well. Highly recommended, it’s not “Ready Player One” yet but it’s a great start.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:46.888618,if you are at all prone to motion sickness do not buy this as it cannot be returned once opened! having said that it is well made and great technology but the feeling can be very uncomfortable,1,1
2022-05-18 19:35:46.888618,"The build quality is not as good as the original Quest. It feels a bit cheaper, because it is a bit cheaper.

It is still a great intro into VR and it has higher resolution and framerates than the original.

Not going to find something better at this price point and since they no longer make the controllers for the original it is hard to recommend that one instead.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:35:47.450984,"I know it is just the begginig of VR so the headset is big and gheavy but... It is to the point I cannot spend much time doing anything... I ended up reselling it.
I got headache wearing it because I have to tightly adjust the headset to my head...
Also, I had allergic reaction to the foam.
I won't be buying any VR headset until it gets much lighter and wearable.",2,2
2022-05-18 19:35:47.450984,The reason I give this a low review is because in the very small print in the instruction manual it warns you not to let children younger than 13 use the game. This should be printed in large print in the ads and on Best Buys site. I returned it because we wanted it for children not adults. It says it can damage their vision since their eyesight is not developed.,2,2
2022-05-18 19:35:47.450984,"As any other product it has its pros and cons. Its biggest pro is that you can use it wirelessly or you can connect to your computer. Be aware, it does not include the cable to link it to your computer which is a separate buy. also, the connection is type-c usb so be mindful of that when buying. My only concern is that the system gets really hot in prolonged use.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:47.450984,I would have given a 5 star but there are no instructions and a start up guide would be handy since you can't operate a phone/tablet and wear the VR device at the same time. I liked it enough that I bought one for my daughter. I'll close saying it would have been a whole lot better experience if there was some kind of guide instead of fumbling your way through.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:47.450984,"Its fun and works with both a pc and standalone. I recommend setting it up with limited privacy and sharing settings. Facebook requires a login.. It's fun tech at the expense of your data going back to ""Facebook"" and in recent events show - money making is their only concern  however they want with data collection on your digital identity. It's creapy and wrong.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:47.450984,"Have tried and used VR in the past but the Oculus is amazing. The immersiveness of the headset is incredible making you feel like you're actually in the bowling alley or on the golf course. I would recommend an Oculus to anyone looking for something new, not just for gaming but for much more journey to the ends of the world fly through the endless vast of space.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:47.450984,"I’ve had the oculus quest and recently upgraded to the quest 2. Picture quality is slightly better, things seem to run really smooth. My favorite redesign is the controllers and being actually see how much battery life each one has left.The new UI more user friendly then before and the headset is smaller and lighter which is a definite plus. I’m glad I upgraded.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:47.450984,The VR headset was bought for my son. He absolutely loves it! But… I’m upset because one of the only reasons I spent over $300 was to receive a $50 e gift card for Best Buy and I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING =( it’s been a week! And today’s Black Friday and I would of loved to use it today. Very disappointed. Hopefully it still sent to me eventually to redeem!!!!!,3,3
2022-05-18 19:35:47.450984,"Is this the future? I don't know, but I have been having a blast with it. The 360 experiences and Big Screen app have been 90% of what I've used it for. I feel I've barely scratched the surface. I do get nauseous when playing it, and it hasn't gone away despite many people telling me it will. Still, I enjoy it in small bursts of 30 minute sessions and I'm fine.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:47.450984,"I told the wife I bought this as exercise equipment for myself. She didn’t believe me and lectured me on how I didn’t need another video game system, until she tried the exercise game supernatural.   Now she wants to go get herself one. This thing is amazing.  You get totally immersed in another world.   Highly recommend this if you have the space to let loose.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:47.950868,The Oculus Quest 2 is an awesome device for the money. There’s a lot of experiences and fun things to try. For example there’s videos on YouTube that make you feel like you are there. Playing games in VR is super fun you feel immersed into the game. The only bad thing is you might get motion sick but if you have enough experience with VR you will get over it.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:47.950868,"this was a Christmas gift for our grandson and he loves it.  It was something on his Christmas list.  As soon as he opend it he started setting it up and began enjoying it.  Perfect gift.

I went from only playing 30 or so minutes at a time to hours in one sitting. 
I love that i can hook it up to my computer for access to my steam library and the games in the quest 2 store are pretty good as well.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:47.950868,I was hesitant about buying this because we already have a PS VR but so glad I did! This VR blows the old one out of the water. So easy to transport and the quality is so much better. My kids couldn’t be happier and us adults even gave it a go. It’s awesome and so happy with my last minute purchase. Their friends tried it out and decided they needed one too!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:47.950868,"I bought this on a whim to see what all this VR stuff was about.  I was so amazed at the virtual world that unfolded around me once I fired it  up and put the headset on.  The optics are fabulous, but I  would suggest getting a headset adapter because the elastic strap is not that comfortable to use.  Otherwise, this is a well constructed and amazing device.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:47.950868,Y'all are a joke.. my item was sent to a different address in a totally different state and i was told that i wouldn't receive refund or anything...not to mention my name wasn't correct...you just let anyone call in and make fraudulent request..whoever is working for you guys and did this needs to be fired!! Yall record the calls go back and listen to it!!!,1,1
2022-05-18 19:35:47.950868,"So much Fun for the whole Family! Easy to set up and love how the game itself creates a safe boundary where the game turns off if you pass it (keeping you from walking into things lolz) Love how it also gets the kids moving. Only downside, or plus depending on how you see it, long periods of playing does give us a headache (making screen time a little less)",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:47.950868,"Overall it’s really great! There’s a few things like comfortability that take a while to find. Personally I wear a hat backwards to help the most, otherwise it’s uncomfortable on my head. But gameplay is fantastic! Also love the Oculus store and how you can return a game within a few days if you have less than (I think) 2 hours played and you don’t like it!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:47.950868,"It has been an adventure I am blown away by what I have found in experiences like being underwater exploring the ocean reefs, touring cities or being in outer space are amazing,  The included tutorials are also exceptional.  You will need a good amount of clear space to enjoy some experience but the area guardian dose a good job if you have a high ceiling.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:47.950868,"had been curious about AI/VR and knowing this is the best out there, I bit the bullet and bought this.  I wasnt disappointed. It works as advertised and in line with other reviewer's observations. I am not really a video gamer. So I use it mainly to watch 360 deg youtube videos and some basic games that come with it. Looking forward to a good Golf game :-)",5,5

Make sure you put the silicone covering over the foam on the goggles, or else you end up with chaffing.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:48.497617,"This is an interesting product.  An avid gamer my entire life, it was my first dip into the ""Meta"" Pool.  The water is warm here and I am enjoying my time with it.  I got most of the essential accessories and the family can enjoy it too.  It's the perfect segway into VR and I will now become a part of the eco system.  Its not perfect, just a great product",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:48.497617,I am legitimately blown away by this device and what it is capable of at the price it is at. It places the games in the store flawlessly. I love how I can connect it to my PC to unlock its full potential by playing more demanding games off of it as well!! The only downside is how you have to connect to FaceBook and you can’t cast to an Apple TV natively.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:48.497617,"My daughter is 14, and when she started working, her goal was to buy this for herself. Not only did she save more than she needed, but she was so proud of herself for purchasing with her own money and her bank card. She spent a few days in her room, even fell asleep with it on one night, and woke with an imprint of the glasses that lasted all day. Lol",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:48.497617,After seeing all the crazy videos online I decided to get an Oculus. I’ve been having a blast with it. I primarily play a fishing game to relax and a boxing game to get my heart rate up and get a little exercise in. First person shooters make me motion sick though. Guess that takes some getting used to. Be sure to get the extended battery head strap.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:48.497617,I was worried that the headset would fail me on the first try but it broke expectations. It feels lighter than I thought and it feels good to move your head in and doesn’t feel like a weight on your head. The only thing that I wished was better is if there was an easier way to connect to your pc to get steam games. Other than that I highly recommend.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:48.497617,This is our second Quest 2 for the household. I got one and I wanted to be able to play with my husband so we got him one too. These are SOOOO much fun and way better than any flat-screen game. I previously had a Nintendo Wii (which obviously I haven't used for several years) and this brought me right back to all the fun I used to have with that. :),5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:48.497617,"This device is fantastic! We have been having a blast playing on it! Games are sold separately, but many of them are free to play if you don’t want to purchase anything. The headset dies in 2-3 hours so I would recommend a long charging cord to go with it. If you’re sitting down you can get motion sick, so standing up helps or take frequent breaks.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:48.497617,"Although it does have some cool games and features, the Oculus Quest is no short of a nightmare to use. The use of the system caused me to get extreme nausea and sickness after less than minutes of use. Controls also arent best even while in VR and make games rather confusing to play. Overall, dont let Facebook tell you this is the future, its not.",2,2
2022-05-18 19:35:49.075605,"Easy to set up, easy to use, easy to lose track of time! Even had a blast picking my ""home"" in settings. Watched some immersive videos on Oculus tv. The 3D is awesome! Had a blast with the tutorial, First Steps, and learned how to use the controllers and manipulate objects. Then I purchased and played Vader Immortal... whole new level! Lots of fun!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:49.075605,"At this price point, the Oculus Quest 2 is a no brainer when it comes to overall quality and VR experience.  I bought this primarily to use with RealFlight 8 software on a PC and it works great with no setup issues at all.  To connect to the computer, I’m using the Insignia™ - 16.4' USB-C Virtual Reality Headset Cable which is BestBuy’s less expensive version of the Oculus branded cable.  Download and run the Oculus app and you are good to go.  I had no issues whatsoever.  Using the Quest 2 as a stand alone VR headset (not connected to a computer) is absolutely amazing.  Being immersed in a game is an experience way beyond playing a game on a flat screen.  You can even watch movies on popular apps like Netflix and Prime while “sitting” in beautiful virtual theater rooms.  Pretty cool.  I’m also impressed with the built in sound and I should mention, the microphone quality is amazing when communicating in virtual rooms.  I love this thing!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:49.075605,Overall it’s got potential.  Not a fan of Facebook integration but what can you do.  Some cool apps but games are pricey just to see if you like them.  Build quality is not as good as I thought would be.  Battery also dies quickly in my experience so I got the extra elite battery and strap.  I like the idea but not quite as good as I was hoping.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:49.075605,"Excellent Product, so much you can do with this device, via virtual desktop, side quest, Steam VR and VorpX. Also using Developer options, No need for exspensive cables, cheaper ones work good once configured properly. But love the freedom to not have wires, a must Buy, but there right not the best for kids, unless your supervising them closely.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:49.075605,The oculus is absolutely mind blowing. I’ve never experienced anything like it in my life. The immersion is spectacular. I bought this for my son for Christmas but I’ve spent quite a few hours while he was at school using it. I wanted to verify it worked before he opened it and possibly had a DOA unit. It is absolutely worth the purchase price!!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:49.075605,"This was an Xmas gift for my youngest who has been asking for one for several months.  Not only was she in disbelief and excited when she opened the gift, she has had a great time so far exploring its features.  She has not done too much on it yet but loves it so far, as has everyone who has tried it for a few minutes.  Very highly recommended.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:49.075605,"Haven’t put this game down since it’s been delivered to my home. This is an very excellent gaming system, it’s so much that you can do on it. I really love playing this VR system along with my children. My oldest son play it non stop, everything just seem so realistic. Most definitely something to get, especially if you do family fun/game night",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:49.075605,Wireless freedom is nice. Has one major flaw that hopefully will get resolved soon but no ETA given. The flaw is it just not support win 11. Airlink is choppy. There are some solutions by putting debug mode. While they help it is not perfect. I will not reinstall and go back to win 10. Hope they can work with Microsoft and get this fixed soon.,3,3
2022-05-18 19:35:49.075605,The one star is not for the product itself but for the difficulties I am having to even begin using it. Have been unable to use due to issues when trying to create a Facebook account. Oculus support has been unable to help and Facebook makes it impossible to contact them. $300 brick. I will change my review if I am ever able to get it working.,1,1
2022-05-18 19:35:49.075605,"This product is very awesome.  If you haven't experience virtual reality, this is really fun.  You have to make separate purchases if you want games or whatever, but it all depends on your budget.  If you can afford to paid the money for this, you can expect to spend some more dollars for the games too.  Was it worth it? Sure.  Is it fun. Yes.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:49.528630,So disappointed I returned it. I don’t play video games so I got it for sightseeing. YouTube videos and reviews said it was great for that. It’s not. Pictures and videos are grainy and not precise. I couldn’t even find the free apps in the store the reviewers talked it. Plus the headset was letting light in because it wouldn’t fit correctly.,1,1
2022-05-18 19:35:49.528630,"System is great! This is our 3rd Oculus Quest 2. Only issue is the “drifting” controllers. With all the movement playing games and exercising with the Oculus, the controllers get messed up. Facebook /Oculus needs to fix this issue otherwise this system will not be our last!

Make sure to buy the 2 year Geek Squad protection! It is worth it!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:49.528630,"It's pretty cool for a standalone VR. I use it for steamvr and with my pc setup it runs and looks great. One thing that I dislike about it is that even when plugged up using a branded cable, it still dies while playing. I used to have the htc vive, which was a downgrade in a lot of ways compared to the quest 2 - but I never got motion sickness when using it. With the Quest 2 I get headaches after playing it for short periods. The fitment over the nose is really strange too and if you don't get the headset tight enough you will fog up your lenses. But it seems like when i get it tight enough it is TOO tight and ends up cutting off blood flow in my head. Overall I would recommend it but you will probably need to spend extra money to be able to find your comfort zone with it.
My headaches aside, it's a great device. This is just my personal experience with it, I will definitely continue to use it and experiment with fitment to find my comfort zone.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:49.528630,The Oculus Quest 2 is a lot of fun did have to buy an upgraded head strap because the one that comes with the set is somewhat uncomfortable on my head.  I have lost weight playing Beat Saber.  It is a lot of fun.  My wife likes to do virtual travel/sightseeing with it.  I'm going to bring it to the in-laws for the Holidays. It will be fun!,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:49.528630,This worked perfectly right out of the box (as it should). Picking it up at Bestbuy worked perfectly also.  I was expecting a wait picking it up Saturday during Christmas shopping season.  When I arrived I asked the blue shirt by the door where to pickup and he pointed to an empty spot at the pickup counter.  I was in and out in 3 minutes.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:49.528630,"This thing is awesome! I was skeptical but really enjoy it. My wife and I use it with the Supernatural workout app and love it.

2022-05-18 19:35:49.528630,"Bought it as birthday gift for my daughter. It was so easy to just get it out of the box and start using it. We had to create a FB account , but that’s fine. The only thing that I don’t like is how it doesn’t have many access to free games. I’m almost on my thirty’s so I guess dizzy quick, wouldn’t recommend for adults only teenagers lol.",4,4

Skydiving ,roller coasters, ocean diving…. You name it . So many possibilities.

Never expected affordable consumer VR

My only complaint is to be careful when wanting to get your credit for referring someone. Ensure that they click your link PRIOR to setting anything up or neither of you will receive the credit.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:49.528630,This is amazing this was my 10yr Christmas gift but everyone in the house is obsessed with this. Glad I have total tech I feel confident in purchasing expensive electronics from Best Buy. I will definitely be buying more of these for my other kids and husband. Walk the plank is a good game.. definitely check it out and use a real board..,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:49.981642,"My child loves this system. Please don’t go into it thinking all the games are free, they aren’t. I’m glad I was aware before we purchased.

I also love that I can view on my phone what she is seeing at any time.",5,5

Unfortunately the battery only lasts between 2-3 hours and there are not many games available, but it is totally worth it. We’ll see more games coming thru in the next following years",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:49.981642,"Oculus Quest 2 is great! Only negative is the fact you need a Facebook to use the online store (there are ways around it with a little research).

The battery life is not good 2.5 hrs on a good day. unless you get an external battery sole aftermarker straps can hold a 10mwh battery which adds about 6-7 hrs or you can get the elite strap with battery which adds about 3 hrs. overall it was well worth  the money.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:49.981642,"This is my second Quest 2, I gave the first one to my brother.

This is the best Oculus/Meta version by far. tracking is surreal, incredibly easy to use, and fits for either light or hardcore gaming if you have Oculus Link and a PC.

I wish the battery lasted longer but it's understandable looking at how small and light the device is.",5,5

The additional 64gb of storage over the previous model is useful because Oculus games don't back up your saves and because there are newer games coming out that take up a lot of space",5,5

Games look great, but still getting used to them, so taking it slow.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:50.559633,"I love this VR headset. I play mostly Echo VR in it, but dabble in other games frequently enough to appreciate it's standalone features. If you are a gamer and want to play extended sessions, pick up a battery pack that fits in your back pocket since that's the biggest shortcoming, closely followed by the limited eyepiece adjustment.",5,5

2022-05-18 19:35:50.559633,"I'd give it five stars if it weren't for the Facebook login requirement.  The headset is a great value, especially for PC gaming with something like Steam VR.  The 128 gb of RAM on this model vs. 256 gb on the more expensive version doesn't come in to play there.  Even with that, you can still get a lot of stuff on the 128gb model.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:50.559633,"Ok so most people think ""At this price range its going to be a mediocre experience into VR"" ... You will be AMAZED at this devices capabilities . I've had more fun on this VR then I've had fun on my gaming console . The things you will experience with VR are like no other in comparison . PLEASE TRY THIS YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT !!!!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:50.559633,"It's a lot of fun, and I can't wait to unlock all the features and apps available. 

My only complaint is the eye area isn't large enough for my glasses, even with the eyeglass extender on (but my frames are larger than usual though.  I also notice that sometimes my left controller isn't always calibrated, but it's not a problem.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:50.559633,"Great virtual gaming for adults!  Impressive technology in a great package.  Includes a free introductory video to explore virtual worlds and option to purchase additional games ($30-$50).

Battery is sufficient, a Facebook account is required to login.  Recommend purchasing Oculus stand for storage to keep your Oculus organized.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:50.559633,This vr is awesome. If you are new to be there is an adjustment period and some games can make you feel sick such as the roller coaster games. But I really enjoy the play options as well as being able to be submerged in what ever you watch!! Only thing is will say like all vr headsets it is not recommended for children under 13.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:50.559633,"Great device, though, I wish it didn't have a required link to a facebook account. Also, regardless of tightness or adjustments, visualizations still seem blurry at times. Would be nice if some of the weight of the device was transferred to the back of the head, it can feel like your face is weighed down significantly sometimes.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:51.137589,This is a product with a lot of potential and my company started using for some interaction in virtual space for tests. It's light to use and the controls are very responsive. I cannot hold more than one hour using though as my eyes get tired. Try to get the version with more memory space in case you will install multiple games.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:51.137589,"Yup! All the good reviews are correct… awesome games, awesome experience and tons of fun. Needing to have a Facebook wasn’t a huge deal and signing in was easy. Buying games is getting a bit expensive but overall, not surprising. Has some demos so that you can try games out and absolutely love the wireless aspect of this thing!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:51.137589,"Incredibly fun, it get expensive buying all the games, but wait for them to go on sale, every game that I have bought at full price has gone on sale at least twice within the last 6 months. And the battery life is poor so get a 10 foot cable to charge while you play. Also, invest in a different headband, you'll be glad you did.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:51.137589,"I got this after a friend told me about the fun she had working out and I was skeptical. However, after getting through the initial setup, I can confirm there are titles that can get you moving without needing a ton of space and make you sweat. Fun titles and videos to sit down and watch while utilizing the full 360 experience.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:51.137589,"I was hesitant at first because I tend to stick to the mainstream gaming system but I am overall pleased. I don't use it too often but still good to have when I do feel like having an immersive experience. In addition to games there you can access Netflix, Explore other parts of the world, and you can even watch VR dirty vids",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:51.137589,"I bought this for my grandkids but ended up buying myself one to! It’s a perfect to play games, exercise, watch movies to! I spend a lot of time playing on this thing and the cool part is that I can play simultaneously with my grandkids when we all play the same game! This is a great buy and will give the family hours of fun!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:51.137589,"A must have gaming system.  Great workout.  Fun for the whole family.  So far, the free games to download have been awesome.
The head strap is the weak point of the device.  Difficult to adjust.  I've ordered a different style strap to replace.  Also, get the Anker charging station.  It keeps the Oculus organized and charged.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:51.137589,"Package was lost but received a replacement after I reached out to Best Buy via expedited shipping. It can get a little hot when playing the oculus which I hope they improve upon in future generations and it isn’t the most comfortable thing to put on. Favorite games would be thrill of the fight, beatsaber, and population one",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:51.137589,"I work as a Software Tester. Once I got Oculus to test, and was surprised. I never knew that technologies made a big step ahead. After testing I ordered Oculus Quest-2. I am very satisfied by the product but I am sure that I should wait for the device more to buy 256Gb. In any case, it is the best purchase of the whole year!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:51.137589,Ok privacy aside I am really digging the VR universe. Beat Saber is a blast and there are a ton of apps that can be downloaded through the headset. And if you plan on using a type c cable to computer then you have access to all of those games as well. Steam VR is also available and adds more options to your gaming inventory.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:51.637506,"Rhats what i did... Upgraded from a Rift CV1 to this headset. Air link is amazing, letting me play in a larger room away from my PC. The higher resolution, clearer lenses, and 120hz refresh are incredible. You will not be disappointed! Dont forget to get a referral code BEFORE you set it up so you can get some store credit!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:51.637506,I love this thing other than the fact that when playing the quality is blurry.. I bought the elite strap and it changed the experience i was able to adjust the head strap where it wasn’t blurry anymore. The things you can do with this thing are pretty awesome! It’s actually enjoyable once you figure out all the adjustments.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:51.637506,"Purchased for our youngest son (8yo) for his birthday.  He loves it and so does his mom.  There are some free games, but most of the games cost money and they can get expensive quick.  Also, be aware that you need a little space to play so if your kid's bedroom isn't big enough they will end up taking over your living room.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:51.637506,"I’m really glad I bought this for my son! He loves it. It shows you how to use the vr and has a lot of things to see and do on it. It does let you create a safe space while playing so you won’t get out of the safe box and run into things. Make sure you buy a stand , charging station or case because it doesn’t come with it.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:51.637506,I love love ❤️  my occulus. I love working out with it...its so much fun! Its really fun if your able yo catch a concert or a sporting event in VR...I watched a concert in VR.Front row seating! I cant even descibe it.My advice to you is if you see eiher bring aired in virtual reality by all means DO IT..You wont regret it!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:51.637506,I bought this as a gift and I can say that it works very well. It does takes some time to get used to and getting the hang of it can be frustrating but it is all worth it once you do. The only other thing that I felt was ehh was the fact that you have to buy almost all the games that are good. Overall it is a good product.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:51.637506,"This thing is amazing!  If you are looking for something that will give you lots of entertainment (as well as family entertainment), this is it!  Also, be ready to at least invest in a third-party strap.  There are a few online that are way better than the one that comes with it.  Otherwise, this is a great purchase/gift!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:51.637506,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. He shares it with his siblings. My kids love this. They really have fun with the device. Seeing them stream their gaming with this with their friends or casting it to the TV is really awesome. Motion Sickness is the a drawback for these things. Also, it doesn't feel that sturdy.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:51.637506,My son loves it and that’s all it matters... Before you buy make sure your pc is vr ready by running ‘steam vr test’. You’ll need pc to run some games that are not available on the headset ie Roblox. After you buy head to YT and watch some videos especially how to air link - it’ll save you time and headache trying to dyi.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:51.637506,"I am new to using vr equipment and found this easy to use.  I am working to get good focus using my eye glasses but I suspect that if you don't need glasses, there would be little problem.  The battery life seems to be a little short, maybe about 2 hours, but one probably shouldn't use it for longer than that at one time.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:52.074870,This headset is overall really good just to play vr  in a while for fun. My only problem is the comfort and you have to keep readjusting when graphics get a little blurry. Overall good for the money and would not disappoint no pc required I’m sure you will be fine I have not took time adjusting and setting everything up.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:52.074870,"I got this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift and gave it to him early. He loves it! He plays it whenever he gets the chance and it really feels like you’re there! The experience is perfect for anyone that isn’t able to travel much, because it has so many exploration games. The games truly give an immersive experience.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:52.074870,"Having had several of the prior generation VR headsets I had almost given up on the idea.  The cable always in the way, accidentally crashing into things, etc...

These change the game completely.  Performance is great, convenience is AMAZING.  No more cable, no more crashing into things.  Very fun for all ages - try it.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:52.074870,"The Oculus was such a big hit with my children that I had to purchase two (2)!!!! It’s an amazing way to keep in touch and play games with their friends in other states! However my husband may like this Christmas gift better than the kids do! It keeps them busy, moving, and interacting with family and friends everywhere!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:52.074870,"Great product, much more comfortable to wear than I anticipated. It's my first VR product, so can't really compare it to other systems, but would definitely recommend the Oculus if your interested in getting started in VR. Would definitely recommend getting a longer data cable and the Elite Head Strap for added comfort.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:52.074870,My hubby got me an oculus for my birthday and i started playing it and i was hooked! Then I let the family get on and they all wanted one of their own so for christmas we bought all 6 of our kids their own oculus quest! Best gift ever! I can rarely get them to come out of the virtual world..lol! we dont regret it at all,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:52.074870,"Wow.  What a blast.  Worth every penny, already.  My whole family has had a blast, and I think we've barely scratched the surface.  Hard to say what's more fun - playing, or watching others play... it's a total riot.  The future of gaming, and everything else, is here - it's VR, and it is already an amazing experience.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:52.074870,"It was a Christmas gift for the hubby and he loves it. He was able to watch a documentary with it and he said that it was like he was there. 
However, if you get motion sickness easy, this is probably not for you. I do and I can’t use it for more than 5 minutes. Dramamine might be the answer but I haven’t tried it yet.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:52.074870,"I used to have the HTC Vive. While yes running VR on PC tends to perform better. I have no complaints about performance or quality of experience. Immersive experience that gives the flexibility to play anywhere without requirement of PC. Cons: Battery life, basic head strap is uncomfortable after long periods of time.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:52.074870,"Unless you plan on buying 50+ games, I find the 128GB to be plenty and am happy I didn't go for the 256GB.

This thing is awesome. Only thing I can say I wish was better is the battery life, but I understand there are separate battery packs you can buy that give it a longer life without having to be charged as often.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:52.559164,"I bought this for my nephew for Christmas, he couldn't contain his excitement when he opened this up, he was so impatient that he didn't even want to charge the headset, let alone, let it charge for less than 10 minutes. (He lets it charge now)

I haven't tried it out but he absolute loves it and that makes me happy.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:52.559164,"I am enjoying my VR set very much. very easy to navigate. initial sign on was fairly easy to do to get started. I don't have FB so I needed to make a profile and just set all on private. 
it is easy to get hooked on playing. I sit down or I'm sure I'd have a YouTube video to post otherwise! 
A lot of fun for sure!!!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:52.559164,"This Oculus Quest 2 is a new level of entertainment and interaction and can only be judged by experience. Try it, buy it, and you will find a game or experience worth the cost of the device. Not sure I’m right? Watch ANY video on YT about the quest 2 and see the various ways this can bring joy to your everyday life.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:52.559164,"Such an awesome experience either with family, friends, or on your own. I bought this as a motivation to move more and gey more exercise. Not only am I getting a work out but even the athletes in my family are getting a work out playing some of the games. I'm looking to buy another one so we can play in team events.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:52.559164,"Best affordable VR headset, definitely worth buying. I was a little worried that I wouldn’t find enough games to make the purchase worth it, but when I bought the headset and browsed the store, there are a bunch of amazing titles on this console. If you’re someone who enjoys VR then I highly recommend this headset.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:52.559164,"I always wanted to experience VR, but had trouble with fitting various ones from other brands due to my glasses finding them uncomfortable, if they fit at all. Well the Oculus Quest 2 has been the answer! I haven't even needed to use the adapter insert for glasses and it's so comfortable and not as heavy as I expected. I have worn it several hours at a time and never got any headaches or experienced any dizziness like I often have with others. And the graphics are amazing! I would suggest not waiting and just buying a case or stand for storing or travel right away. It seems the charge depletes rapidly when it's carried around loose in a bag which I do regularly as I take it to work with me to help my 12 hour solo night shift pass by. If the controllers tap together or if the power button on the headset gets touched it turns on and a proper case would eliminate that completely! Set up was mostly easy and straight forward, but it did take a little longer than anticipated.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:52.559164,"Purchased the first one for the kids but realized I was having WAAAY too much fun so I had to get them another one. It is really great in getting me to actually workout with realizing it. Speaking work out, the exercise games and apps are really cool. One of the best purchases I have made that I am VERY HAPPY with.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:52.559164,"The device is fun, but unless you have a good gaming PC to run it on, the games on the headset aren’t that immersive. If you have a gaming PC, you will need to connect your PC to a Wifi 6 router via Ethernet in order to play wirelessly with low latency. If you can set all this up, the 120hz frame rate is worth it.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:52.559164,Got it as a Christmas gift and it didn't fit my glasses. Added the glasses spacer but that didn't add any width so it still didn't fit. Tried to order prescription lenses and it said my prescription was not within their range. Very frustrating that the product is not glasses friendly. Will be looking to return it.,1,1

2022-05-18 19:35:53.027772,"I couldn't believe how freaking awesome this would be! I only have the one game so far but this is by far the coolest thing I own, and I have some really neat stuff! So inexpensive too, less than what I spent on my phone. Oh and had I tried this before I got my 70' TV, I never would have bought the TV! Seriously.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:53.027772,My kids saved up their Christmas and birthday money and bought this for themselves. They absolutely love  it and have played Witt it almost everyday since.

2022-05-18 19:35:53.027772,"I absolutely love this product. Both my wife and I use it for playing the provided and paid games and it's quite the experience. I also use it with the Oculus VR Link cable to play Microsoft Flight Simulator to do some General Aviation training.

2022-05-18 19:35:53.027772,"My son loves this. It truly is a wonder. I have to pry him away from it! The only thing I don’t like is I had to open a Facebook account to do anything with it. There is t really a way around that. I tried. I don’t use Facebook when possible. To many hacks. If I had known ahead of time, I wouldn’t have bought it.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:53.027772,"I have always been a nintendo fan, and underestimated VR, but after trying it Holy cow! I'm blown away at how fun it is and that you can return digital games* if you don't like them.  I've wasted too much money on the eshop also before you set it up,  have some one referr you,  as you both get credit to buy games",4,4

2022-05-18 19:35:54.011945,The image quality is better than I had expected. There are a lot of games to play and they can differ greatly. I would recommend getting the strap to adjust the size because it can run big and slip down. The immersive feeling is unlike any other vr I have tried. I recommend this for gamers and families alike.,5,5

The kids get sweaty and I had to buy the expert headband kit and cleaning wipes and plastic covers, but I love this thing. Haven’t even tried it, but anything that gives the kids that much of a workout!!! Their little muscles were sore the next day!!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:54.011945,I have a problem with Best buy delaying their shipment on Quest 2 of about 5 days and more upcoming delays in the future for the Quest 2.,1,1
2022-05-18 19:35:54.464971,"The quest 2 is MUCH better than the Rift S.. because it is wireless and easy to use. The screen is pretty good no real issues, the only thing that bugs me is the headset feels a little heavy on my head.. after 45 mins of playtime i can feel it bringing my neck down, other than that must HAVE VR headset.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:54.464971,"Is it as powerful as other, more expensive VR headsets? No. But it is the biggest bang for your buck! User friendly for VR newbies but with plenty of features for people who want more out of it. Plus, having the ability to connect to your PC to play Steam VR games makes this one of the best you can get.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:54.464971,This is a lot of fun. I was not sure what to expect with this item. But it is fun and entertaining. The games/apps can be pricey but it is nice most will let you try them for a period of time. I have not had it long enough to know if it holds up but my wife and kids have enjoyed playing with it as well.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:54.464971,This is the best money I’ve ever spent on entertainment!  I’m 54 woman and I’ve been having the most fun killing zombies and working out (having too much fun to realize what a work out it is). I play with this headset every single day. My grandkids were hoping I would bore of it. Nope GMA is keeping it.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:54.464971,"This is a lot of fun for the whole family.  Its easy to navigate and easy to figure out. 
Draw back, you need an active Facebook account to use. It you are a Facebook jail habitual offender it will become a paper weight.  Also be prepared to spend more money on games, as the free ones arent that great.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:54.464971,This thing is so awesome and crazy how real it feels being in a virtual reality. Love being able to connect with family and friends that live far away and play games and interact with each other. Only thing I didn’t know prior to purchasing is you have to have a Facebook account to be able to use this.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:54.464971,"The reason Im only giving this four stars is because when I wear it too long it causes my head to hurt and it dies too fast while playing. It feels like the battery life lasts an hour max sometimes of pure playing. Thats the only reason I'm giving it four stars, other than that: Tip top! Great product.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:54.464971,"It was fun, however it's not really a shareable game due to the hygiene issue of the device going from one forehead to another. This is also not good for people who need bifocals or suffer from migraines. The concept is fun and cute, however we returned this because it wasn't fun for the entire family.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:35:54.464971,Love this product!  I bought my grandaughter one for Christmas and had so much fun with it we purchased a second one for the house. Definitely worth every penny.   The only thing I don't like is that the headset gets a little heavy on you head but only after prolonged use.  Overall I give it a solid A,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:54.464971,this headset is a must have if you’re getting into vr. the quality and performance is perfect for a starter. The standalone feature is amazing and makes things so much easier. The headset overall is really comfortable and there’s so many aftermarket accessories you can buy to make it more comfortable.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:54.902366,"I love this. I do t have any other vr set to compare it to, but this thing is great. It definitely got me sick at first. I havent downloaded a lot on it but theres lots of things besides games you can do. There are a lot of educational tools on here also. I work out with it. Supernatural is my go to.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:54.902366,Storage is my first gripe it doesn’t come with much but I also didn’t have to buy and expensive computer for it either plus PlayStation updated version isn’t out yet also u need a Facebook account which I don’t have but other than that it’s cool make sure too grab accessories because you’ll need them,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:54.902366,Bought 3 of these for the kids. They love it and use them constantly. Looking forward to try watching some sports on it when baseball starts! Only downside is that it doesn't fit very well with my glasses. Might need to get a special pair or see if there is a way to focus it in for my prescription...,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:54.902366,Had wanted one of these for over a year. Finally purchased this holiday season. So fun. Careful though as many can experience motion sickness. I jumped straight into intense games and that wasnt the best idea. start off with more relaxed games. Catch me playing mini golf or table tenis with the bois.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:54.902366,"Great toy for the kids and me too. this system is a lot of fun my kid forgot he wanted a PS5, there is some free games on the app and found some cool games on the app for less than $25 bucks. the reason i didn't give 5 stars is the battery, the battery is horrible you can only play for about 30 mins.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:54.902366,"Diving into VR for the very first time was an amazing experience and feeling, the vr headset works perfectly still is. If you want to know more about the quest 2 go to YouTube & watch Virtual Panda. I also dived into Vrchat, add me on oculus and Vrchat at LLENN_19 

Add me on Instagram too at im.___v",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:54.902366,"My friends have the original Oculus, and I had a blast playing it, beatsaber, watching netflix is pretty fun, it's your own personal theater experience. the external speakers are really nice and immersive. Its a great mid tier vr system that won't break the bank and you will have an entertaining time",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:54.902366,LOVE LOVE LOVE. This has been great family fun. It comes with some demo games. New games are easy to purchase. Like that it requires a password to access it if needed. Has held up to hours of play. Great for all age levels. Only complaint is that to adjust sizing from person to person can be a pain.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:54.902366,This is the future we have all been waiting for!  This Quest 2 is better than I expected!  I am using it with my computer and the Immersed App to see 5 Displays (4 Virtual) and see my iPhone (at the same time) all in Virtual Reality! Wow!  Plus gaming in 3D!  Social in 3D!  Wow!  This is the future!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:54.902366,I've resisted VR because it was too expensive and I didn't have the money to buy another computer to support it. This headset looks great and the games are amazing. I bought Resident Evil 4 and it runs smooth and is very immersive. I love this device and hope I can get more of my friends to get one.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:55.511598,"so far, so good. i'm glad for the increased storage space and it has a lot of support online. looking forward to check out the much improved Virtual experience, and the ability to connect with my pc and play games via the Bluetooth connection.  we just need more sales on games at the oculus website",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:55.511598,"I absolutely love that I can do VR for quite a cheaper price! The quest 2 makes that possible and I love that it’s wireless. Of course you can still connect it to a PC or laptop to download extra stuff but having it wireless is great.
I wish there were more game options as well as a longer battery!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:55.511598,Works as advertised. If you can get car sick be careful. These can make you dizzy and it’s tough to play over long periods of time. Very fun to use. As a note their privacy policy is sus. I bought these for parties. Got them during Black Friday and got a $50 gift card with them. Nice deal Best Buy.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:55.511598,"Absolutely blown away. The Multiverse is shapping up and you do not want to miss out! Being part of it with the Oculus Quest 2 is the way to go. 

It gets a 4 out of five due to the basic head strap and the face padding is pretty weak.

Four stars for the utility, smooth interface and price point!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:55.511598,"I have not experienced any motion sickness using the Oculus so I am able to enjoy playing this alot more with my husband. We also own the PSVR, which I was never able to enjoy that often due to motion sickness from it. So not experiencing any motion sickness from the Oculus was a huge plus to me!!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:55.511598,"Lives up to most of the hype.  Pros: easy to use, battery is decent, good selection of (free) games.  Cons: tethering seems a little twitchy (cable not included) and the headband isn't great.  My 12 year old is pretty happy with it though and NO WAY I was going to spend the $1000 for the next one.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:55.511598,"As a mom I purchased this Oculus 2 for my family.  I found a workout game that I love and I have used this thing 81 days in a row.  (this is from a couch potato to a VR addict)  There are a lot of really fun games, but what I love is the workout game.  I'd recommend this to EVERYONE, it's so fun!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:55.511598,My son loves it.  He and his friends look hysterical when they are playing.  The one caution i would have is make sure you have an open area while you have the headset on and you are playing.  They have hit a few beds in the process of learning boundaries. Buy it and enjoy a better way of gaming.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:55.511598,"This is super cool. Lots of fun content and fantastic images. I have become a fan of VR!
Plenty of adjustment options to fit your head and face as well as accessories. I would recommend at a minimum an Oculus case to protect and organize. Also I have ordered prescription lenses to fit my headset,",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:55.511598,"This is the coolest tech out right now. It’s super affordable and the possibilities are literally limitless. Pair with a powerful PC and the VR world is your oyster. I was so excited to buy this. The best $300 I’ve ever spent on anything. And the staff was super helpful and friendly at Salem, NH.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:55.995856,Love it!! I would hope the gaming selection will expand and have a bigger selection like the other regular gaming consoles. And the thing I would recommend is getting the cushion or a different head strap because after a while of using starting experience pressure headache on the back of my head.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:55.995856,"My almost 16-year old loves their Oculus VR.  They use it virtually (no pun intended) non-stop.  The quality is great and provides a great deal of laughter for both of my children (my eldest shares the VR with their sister when  they are both getting along).  It is very ""real"" and great quality.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:55.995856,This is actually a gift for my parents. I got mine earlier this year and love it. So I decided that they needed to have something to help them keep active and have fun. My dad can fly planes while my mom can have fun with angry birds. Also they can tour and see exhibits without leaving the house,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:55.995856,"This headset has a lot going for it; it’s light-weight  & portable, has a crisp bright screen, and an affordable price for anyone curious about VR.

The only trade-off is that the graphics are not as impressive as a tethered VR headset, but there are plenty games that still manage to look good!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:55.995856,"It has a very small sweet spot. When playing a game with movement it would get out of focus. Also, it is heavy on the front of your face. Does seem like a very ergonomic setup. The elite strap helped. But this just resulted on added pressure on your face. I had purchased two and took them back.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:35:55.995856,"Super cool experience and gift that was loved by our son at Christmas. The software can be finicky as heck. Hard to set up the guardian and screen pops off at times but the overall experience is awesome. Would be great if they could figure out the hiccups of the guardian. Ot
Would be a 5 then.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:55.995856,Very nice product. Works great for me and my kids (very easy to install and to adjust). This makes a real difference. I would recommended it for my friends. Have seen some complains about quality. Therefore I bought the extra 2 year warranty for $10. Bought the product 3 weeks ago - no issues!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:55.995856,"Wonderful! Kinda hard to first setup, battery doesn't last long and it sucks having to constantly keep it plugged in with such a short cord, if you want the 18 ft cord you can't use an aftermarket one from Amazon I tried it and it would barely charge it if you get the actual one it's like $80",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:55.995856,"Let me start by saying this is the first VR we have had. I have no way to compare the Oculus to any other VR. I really like the unit.  It has amazing quality and is easy to use. You should be aware that it takes a while to get used to having them on your head and you can easily get motion sick. I suggest playing only games that don't have you flying around and only playing for about 15 minutes at a time for the first few weeks.  Most of the games will cost you extra money but aren't that expensive.  The reason I gave it a 4 star are twofold.  First,  the strap is junk. Just prepare to watch YouTube videos on after market straps and get one.  Most on the market are way more comfortable than what comes with the unit. Second,  you must have a Facebook account.  That is extremely annoying to me.  I know Facebook owns Oculus but what does one have to do with the other? As far as I'm concerned. Facebook is useless.  Despite those two issues we as a family are loving the unit and enjoying the games.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:55.995856,"Wow just Wow, I never though the virtual reallity will be this good. I enjoy watching Youtube VR and netflix. Totally worth the price. Got the 128gb and its plenty of space for not a every day play. If you hardcore player must get the 256gb. Amazing device but can improve a bit on the weight.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:56.526986,For the money it’s pretty good. Not sure why it’s so nerfed from the factory. You have to dl a program on your Pc to up the resoltion and textures. It’s pretty blurry if you don’t. Haven’t tried it for pc yet but the native library has been fun. Not sure how I feel about the Facebook log in.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:56.526986,"Pros: Immersive VR, Quality Build, Comfortable controllers

Cons: There are barely any QUALITY games!!! A lot of shovel ware on this thing. Un-syncs boundaries at odd times

Bottom Line: Save your money until they have a well known library of quality games, otherwise you are not missing out.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:35:56.526986,"Recently bought this device to venture off into the virtual reality world. It’s an okay device, I just have to get use to the graphics and motion of the game. I’ve had it for a while and only played it twice. I would suggest this device in case children or other adults come over and hangout.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:56.526986,I realized over the past two years that it was unlikely I'd be traveling outside the US in the future. I've lived in many countries and have many more on my to do list. Oculus Quest 2 is a way for me to revisit places I've been to before as well as to check out places I haven't seen before.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:56.526986,"I'm really impressed with the overall solidness and polishness. The tracking is incredible! There're all sorts of great games and experiences to play with! Evenmore they're updating the core software all the time adding really significant new capabilities! Worth your money, it's the future!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:56.526986,"The oculus is amazing, works just as described and has tons and tons of games available. There’s something for everyone and it’s super fun to bring out when you have some friends over for some good laughs. If you purchase an oculus id recommend the super shot game and the walking dead game.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:56.526986,"This vr headset is amazing for the price.  I have a powerful pc and can wirelessly stream Steam vr games to the Quest 2 with basically zero lag and at 120 hz.  Controllers are comfortable in the hand and track great.  Some games, you don't even need the controllers, you just use your hands.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:56.526986,"i was optimistic when i bought this for my wife picturing all kinds of trouble like her falling over furniture but the software is smart and sets up a ""play area"" before you start so you make sure you don't lose track of physical items around you.  so far a lot of fun for the whole family.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:56.526986,"We opened the Oculus 2, fully charged it, and went to go set it up. Headset onto turn on for longer than a few seconds. Tries everything recommend including several factory resets. Nothing worked. Have been waiting for a long time to hear back from Oculus support. My son is totally bummed.",1,1
2022-05-18 19:35:56.526986,"My first VR set. While there is a tiny bit of blur, its still amazing none the less. I reccomend Walkaround Golf. Be aware that if your eyes are very far apart, you may have an issue like I do. You can adust the distance, but only so far. There is also a glasses holder if you wear glasses.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:56.995625,Very realistic and immersive. I would recommend buying a new strap or face padding. Can be a little uncomfortable but once you get it adjusted right it’s not too bad. A case wouldn’t be a bad additional purchase as well although the box it comes in does provide some pretty decent storage.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:56.995625,"The joystick started malfunctioning on the second day. It got a bad drift which made any game unplayable. It was fun for the 4 total gameplay hours I got out of it? And no, I didn’t smack it against the wall or anything and I tried all the recommended calibration tips I could find online.",1,1
2022-05-18 19:35:56.995625,"Quick and easy set up. Yes, a FB Account is needed but you can set up privacy from messages in case someone else besides you is using the headset. I purchased another headstrap for extra comfort. Overall, it's definitely worth the money and the 128gb is more than enough storage. Have fun!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:56.995625,"Amazing product! I was never a techie or even a player but this got me hooked! Lots of nice games that takes you out of this world! Battery does not last long but extended batteries are available! Honestly, 2 hours is good enough playing time for me, or else my eyes would be so strained!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:56.995625,"I was skeptical of purchasing this product from the amount of off brand VR sets I've tried in the past, I was way off this experience is something you can only really experience a review doesn't give this product enough credit, if you like gaming you may never go back to 2d gaming again.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:56.995625,"1st one we received had a tool mark on the right lens.
Best buy replaced it very smoothly, kudos to them.
The replacement unit has a dead pixel in the right lens, which we are choosing to live with.
Great fun when playing but check the condition carefully when you first receive the unit.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:56.995625,"I owned a VR set when they first started coming on the market, I was skeptical the Ocolus Quest 2 would be any different but boy was I wrong. This VR headset is unbelievable. The price point in my opinion is low for the tech you’re receiving but I’m not going to complain about the price!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:56.995625,"At this price point, it has no rivals.

The stock headband was extremely uncomfortable and had to purchase additional third party headbands. There is no adaptation for myopia. The clarity is still not high enough and the contrast is not enough. The device is also still relatively heavy.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:56.995625,"This much tech working this well at an entry point this low is a rare thing. It’s nice that you can connect it to your pc and use your pc graphics card power to spit out better visuals too. I don’t like the facebook requirement, and the store needs quick demos. Other than that, fun toy!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:56.995625,Fun and great for playing Alynx -Half-Life. The evolution of OQ is amazing. Like to see what's next. The resolution in watching movies and PC games is really good. This has better value over the 256 GB version if you own a Gaming PC this is all you need. Most games are stored on the PC.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:57.526720,Love this system!! you actually become part of the game. visiting the world trade center towers felt like we was actually they’re actually floating above the city. Getting the Oculus quest2 advanced all-in-one virtual reality headset on sale at Best Buy made the experience even sweeter.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:57.526720,"This was actually the second quest we bought as a gift for my fiances son in FL. We have been completely happy with both although I would advise getting the extra battery strap, its placing on the back of your head helps balance out the Oculus as it can feel a bit too heavy on your face",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:57.526720,"Fully wireless 360 degree VR, enough said?! I mean Resident Evil 4 was just a blast on this thing. Also has the best Star Wars games on it. I recommend it, but also recommend buying the Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap With Battery, if you can. Stock Battery lasts roughly 1.5-2 hours in play.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:57.526720,Incredibly fun and immersive! Waiting for more games to come out. Would love to see more games geared towards women! My only complaint would be that the headset is heavy and hurts your head after extended periods of time. The elite strap does help with that though. Overall lots of fun!,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:57.526720,"I think this device is fantastic. I haven't found anything to complain about on the hardware side. My main issue is the lack of parental controls. My 9 year old is obsessed with the device, but I have to monitor closely when he's using it to prevent him from interacting with strangers.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:57.526720,"128 Gb is best for me because I mainly use oculus link and the few I do have on the headset are ones that I like a lot or I need more movement on 

And the product is good but you might want to buy a head strap for it you don’t have to buy a oculus one just buy a 3rd party if you want.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:57.526720,Its great if u have a ton of money to spend on the expensive games . Eventually ull want new games cuz u get bored after a while Nd u def need the rubber cases to protect it cuz u will tend to hit the controllers on the head sometimes.but either than that its fun while it lasts.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:57.526720,Been wanting one of these for awhile and wife picked me up one for Christmas. This thing is amazing from going on 3D trips to different parts of the world to having fun in games like beat saber. The amount of things you can do with this is amazing and will entertain the entire family!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:57.526720,"Works great.   Amazing graphics.  However, very, very difficult for an older guy to learn how to use.  Of course there are no instructions.  Bought it mainly for the exercise activities but now I have to pay an additional fee[monthly/yearly] for this.  Not sure it was a wise purchase.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:35:57.526720,Great images and excellent value for money. Took a little bit time to set it up properly. The headset is a bit heavy and difficult to stabilize when moving. Need to improve the fasteners.  Otherwise it is a lot of fun to play with. It has the potential to grow the sales exponentially.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:57.964117,The oculus quest 2 is a masterpiece the sensors are fantastic the box and how I come is great you don’t even need instructions it comes with a charger just saying cuz It doesn’t clarify that It has so many great free games every thing about it I love great choice to buy all out great,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:57.964117,"I bought this game system for my nephew after I played with his friend's set.  My nephew and I both love it!

2022-05-18 19:35:57.964117,"I thought this hoping everyone in the family could use it. I've not been disappointed. There is so much VR content out there that are not games, I couldn't be happier. Guided meditation and productivity apps are a plus. I even started playing games for the first time in thirty years!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:57.964117,"Quality is great, visual is awesome, effects and sounds are amazing. Kid friendly, got it for our 9 year old and he loves it and found that it was very easy to navigate. Our 6 year old also uses it and its very easy for her to use.

The head adjustments can ne a pain but not horrible",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:57.964117,"I bought one for my son as a Christmas present and he wanted me to try it. I did so reluctantly, but after playing for about 10 minutes, I left to buy one for myself. Now we play together and have a blast doing so! It’s a little dizzying at times but worth the time spent with my kid.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:57.964117,It is amazing! First VR Headset & I have to say it is pretty cool! The quality of the gameplay is great.

2022-05-18 19:35:57.964117,"Very cool gaming device. Must have facebook account and my 12 year old doesn’t have one so I had to use mine to get the device up and running. Similar to the Wii, it definitely is a new concept in playing video games. Would recommend as more games (and better ones) become available.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:57.964117,"Great product and My son is huge gamer; usually not moving 
from his home for long periods of time. Now he's upstairs, downstairs using different rooms on the house and constantly moving.  For those worried about lack of exercise for their kids I Highly recommend the Oculus Quest 2.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:57.964117,It’s a neat piece of technology but it’s just not perfected yet.  It’s often blurry (unless the headset is positioned just right) and the resolution while impressive still has room to improve.  Unless you’re a gamer and have a lot of time on your hands this is probably not for you.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:57.964117,Wow…it’s a really immersive product that allows u to dove into any activity in any way you want. Streaming apps like YouTube and Netflix look amazing whilst the games u play can even be played in the comfort of your bed. Great product can’t wait for whatever else is to come with it,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:58.417167,"Love every bit of this head set. Its comfortable, it has better picture quaity then ps4 and doesnt have the screen door effect plus has extra features like drawing your playing area and a camera so you dont have to take off the headset to see. Love everything about it! No cords!!!!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:58.417167,"My grandson wanted this for his 9th Birthday.  When I got to the store and started chatting with the BB Rep, he explained some of the features and games, which made me decided to grab one for myself as well.  I am 59 and not a techy type person so I was a little hesitant about setting this up, but it was very easy.  And later I found out my 9 year grandson set his up too.  He also taught me that can view the players on your TV and watch them play as well.  

So far the only thing I would recommend is following the instructions on how long to wear the Oculus when first starting out.  I wore it for over 1.5 hours and I did get a slight headache, the recommended time is only 15 minutes (oops, I was really caught up...lol).

Now my granddaughter wants one.  Great family time fun and more free game then I expected, although you have to make sure they are not just the demos...

I gave it a 5 star on the value, only because of the 12 month interest free financing, otherwise it is a little pricey, but worth it.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:58.417167,"This is going to be the perfect gift for my 12 year old son for Christmas. He has a STEAM account which he can download games from and I can also use it for fitness, which I can excited about. I am also intrigued with the horror games personally so I can't wait for him to share. :)",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:58.417167,"Depending on the games you download and play, you'll be sweating for sure. Of course there are non-physically active games on there too, but it's a lot more fun to play games where you're sword fighting and actually swinging your arms to do so. For $300 it's a well worthy purchase.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:58.417167,"My son got this for Christmas and hasn’t put it down since. He enjoys the game a lot. He’s 13, but I played it as an adult and it gives me a headache and get dizzy after just after a few minutes attempting to play it. The handles are comfortable to hold and the headset isn’t heavy.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:58.417167,"I am brand new to the VR world and I love this thing. Best $300 I’ve spent for entertainment in years. I bought the 128GB but if I had a do over I would definitely get the 256GB. I can see downloading lots of games and apps in the future. It really deserves 5+stars but I am having a couple of small issues with this headset. Every now and then it goes to black screen in the middle of playing a game, sometimes I have to adjust the headset a tiny bit and it goes blank. May be my fault, might not be? Also, the battery doesn’t last very long but I did fix that issue with a backup battery pack which adds at least 2-3 hrs. more to playing time, totally worth it. I ordered mine from bestbuy.com and it was delivered in 2 days with free shipping, you can’t beat that unless you go pick it up yourself. Thank you Best Buy! All in all it’s the best toy I’ve ever had and I’m in my 50’s. I use it every night and I have a few relatives and friends who also have an oculus quest 2 so game on! Get one, you won’t regret it.",4,4

2022-05-18 19:35:58.417167,A lot of my buddies had picked one of these up and I was skeptical at first because it’s a stand alone console instead of the PC hookup version. This was honestly a great purchase and I know it’s a hot item these holidays so I snagged one up before they went missing on the shelves.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:58.417167,This is the perfect introduction to VR. ESPECIALLY since the introduction of Oculus AirLink. No more wires to play PCVR games. Just connect your PC and Quest to the same internet and play as if you were hard-wired in. There is absolutely no latency. I couldn't recommend it enough.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:58.432789,I love this...easy to use and there is even a demo on how to use the headset and demos to get you comfortable with the hand controls and navigating within the gaming system.  There are some free games out there that are worth it...just have to look.  The love watching others play.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:59.073261,"Well I’m pretty sure I won Christmas. I gave this to my husband because his quest 1 was going the way of old yeller. Anyway, I haven’t had to hear from him at night since Christmas. Which is both great and not lol silence is golden after all! 

 I can’t wait to try it out. Thanks.",5,5

There are plenty of VR experiences that don't induce motion sickness, and with a little practice I was able to get over the ones that do.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:59.073261,"The Oculus is a very high quality VR Headset,  However it is rather clunky to set up.  There were no instructions in the package,  They expect you to use the tutorial program to learn how to use it.  However, just finding the program is a little difficult without ay VR experience.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:59.073261,"I love it! Easy to assemble and the software is easy to configure. I would advise any future buyer to purchase the extended strap which provides a more stern ability for the headset and also the charging dock station to prevent excessive purchase of batteries. Overall, I love it!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:59.073261,Got the quest 2 for VR gaming on PC.  Overall experience is good.  Played halflife Alyx using an oculus link cable that was purchased separately.  Has the ability to connect wireless through airlink using a high speed router. Great features for the price compared to other models.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:59.073261,"My 13yr old son loves it. I got this for him after a hockey tournament where I was able to get in to play it. It is a solid unit and good entry level if you have a budget like I do. It is NOT as expensive as some of the high end units, but still expensive enough. My son loves it.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:59.073261,"This was a wonderful piece of electronic to have. It was fun while I had it, but I did end up returning it. After much thought on this item, buying this for $300 and then having to purchase each individual VR game for a hefty price was no different than any other gaming console.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:59.073261,"WOW! The Oculus is amazing! The graphics are surreal! My child loved it so much that I had to get one for myself as well!  One caution to those that may unknowingly suffer from motion sickness - be aware! Otherwise, it’s a great buy with hours and hours of fun and entertainment.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:59.073261,"I am not much of a gamer, but I love my new Oculus VR headset. I am having a great time with Beat Saber and Supernatural workouts. I can work up a sweat and have fun while I'm at it. Also, Tripp is a great relaxation app. It's like a legal acid trip without all the side effects.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:59.073261,"I bought this as a gift but was able to play a few games.  This VR is a lot of fun. So many funny videos of people taking VR too literal. Good graphics, fluid gameplay, and a nice feature that turns OFF the VR if you physically go outside the boundaries. I highly recommend this.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:59.557523,"Incredible technology...both my kids (12 & 16) got these and use them together to play in VR world. I tried them in some ""Walking Dead"" type game...incredible. i could get addicted to this device. My son plays a great golf game on it too (he's an actual golfer too) and loves it!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:59.557523,"I purchased this mostly for Supernatural.  I love it for that.  I will not being taking part in Zuckerberg’s meta verse data farming.  I love working out in VR, but hate that I had to create a FB account to use it.  I opted to create an account with zero personal data or photos.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:59.557523,"Pros - great with family and friends and by yourself and the metaverse. It has plenty of games for you to try out for what your into. Also has airlink which I was surprised by on how good it is for beta I’m able to do everything I can on my desktop in my vr headset. The controllers are great for my big hands fits very well.

Cons- the head strap doesn’t fit me very well but overtime it seemed to loosen up a bit to fit me just well I do have a decent sized head. The battery life is definitely a con it doesn’t last long but I think that’s a good thing you don’t want to be inside this vr headset for long but if you do there is the elite strap or other straps that are cheaper with batteries that can give you a better battery life. And for the charging cable I thought it would be longer but it is pretty short, it just reaches the top of my desk to charge which is good wouldn’t want to put this expensive item on the ground to charge. 

Overall I’m happy it will be used for my personal time and family and friends.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:35:59.557523,"Amazing VR experience for around $299. Only real complaint about this device is the battery life. The battery life is only around 2 Hours and then have to charge it again. Other than that amazing VR and plenty of games for all of genres (ie FPS, adventure, puzzle, sports, etc)",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:59.557523,Only thing thats a little skeptical is that your need a facebook account to use this but over all it got here in perfect condition definitely was hesitant about buying it at first because i didn't know if it was going to be worth the $300 but it definitely is worth every cent,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:59.557523,I was hesitant to buy it but it’s been the best purchase. So much fun. You can do so much with it not just games. I’ve learned and I’ve watched movies. I’ve interacted with friends. I do have bad motion sickness and I got super sick last night. But they do things to help you.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:59.557523,"I absolutely love this system and the fact that when you buy a game if you try it out (of course there are guidelines)  and you don't like it, you csn request a refund. There are a wide variety of games that are free or you can purchase. My son says it's the best thing ever.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:35:59.557523,"Product is good as a whole, everything is as advertised with the main unit my only complaint is that It is pretty much universally recommended that if you intend to use it more than 10 min a week you immediately have to purchase the upgraded head strap for 50$ dollars more….",4,4

2022-05-18 19:36:00.104268,They work great but they forget to tell you that your are going to have to buy the games in order to play on there    I thought it came sith several games that were shown on the ad for them but I was wrong  So you need to pay like another $20-$30 PER GAME to really use them,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:00.104268,I love the occulus. You can watch movies. Feel like you really in there n the games are so cool on how far VR has come and it's only going to get better. Don't believe me.

2022-05-18 19:36:00.104268,I purchased this after owning the first Oculus headset and I haven’t been disappointed.

2022-05-18 19:36:00.682260,The fact that my children have gotten dozens of hours of entertainment out of this device is enough for me to review it positively.

Nowadays 50 bucks is bucks,3,3

2022-05-18 19:36:01.197735,"One fatal flaw: no parental controls!

The experience is amazing.  We got this for Christmas and spent the day playing Beat Saber.  It takes some getting used to if you've never done VR before, but it's just incredible.

A few nitpicks - I had read online that it came with demos of popular games.  There were none installed and it was hard to even find demos in the store.  So we ended up purchasing Beat Saber because it had a refund policy.  Then I found out, after we decided to return the device and had done a factory reset, that you could only get an automatic refund using the original device.  So I am waiting on Oculus support to refund the purchase of Beat Saber.  Hopefully that works out.

The reason we are returning it, however, is that there are no parental controls whatsoever.  There is a built-in web browser that cannot be disabled.  So if you let kids play with this device, you are giving them unrestricted access to whatever they find on the web.  For our family, that's a non-starter.  Back to Best Buy it goes.",4,4

2022-05-18 19:36:01.775755,My boys love playing on the oculus. I like it because it keeps them moving instead of on their butts playing Xbox. My wife loves it for the safety features. It lets you map out a “boundary” area so you don’t accidentally bump into and break things or hurt yourself.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:02.213153,The Oculus is so fun. So many different types of experiences from visiting another country to riding a roller coaster. My daughters love Beat Saber. We have also tried the Paranormal game. Being that it is 3d it offers an amazing experience. Glad we purchased it!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:02.213153,"This is my 2nd VR device and I love it. Works great with Steam games as well as being able to play independently without a PC. Simple and easy to setup.

Definitely need a replacement head strap as the one that comes with it becomes uncomfortable and slips often.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:02.213153,"VR is still in it's infancy stage. Long ways to go, lots of bugs still. When you put the headset you just want it to work. Sometimes just to connect to a laptop is lots of work. One good game though, Alyx! Try it but don't but it. Wait for like 2 more generations",3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:02.213153,This product saved my marriage.   I bought this for my wife after I broke a video game she loved.  I prayed that she would enjoy it and forgive me.  The family tried it and on Christmas day it was entertaining for all. I now look forward to 33 years together!! :),5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:02.213153,it's a really good standalone vr if you don't have a pc. if you do have a pc that can handle vr you can connect this headset to it through a link cable or your wifi. runs games really well and virtually no lag when connected to your pc over a wireless connection.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:02.213153,I brought this as a Christmas gift to my teenage son.  I decided to give it a try for myself and i was pretty amazed at the graphics that it displays. The games are really fun. This is a great way to pass the time when you are bored. Or just need something to do.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:02.213153,Overall a great product fairly easy to set up and use. It's nice that it can be used with or without a computer. This isn't the highest resolution VR but it's a great starter. Only complaint is edges are a bit fuzzy in my vision and the adjustment doesn't fix it.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:02.213153,"For my son and he loves it
Games, connectivity, all of what he's always wanted (he's been asking for a VR set for a long time)

Could not get it to work with the PC after purchasing the extra cord - I think that's more on my computer's end than the Oculus' fault.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:02.213153,"Awesome, tons of fun playing the boxing game and beat saber. It's not life changing technology but it's very easy to use and fun (kinda like the nintendo wii on steroids). my only real gripe is that you have to use your facebook account (or create one) to use it",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:02.666178,"Can’t actually review product. It was a gift to a family member. However, from what i’ve heard so far it was a great electronic amusement addition.

While acquisition was a little bumpy, everything was received in the promised delivery times. Thanks to Best Buy.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:02.666178,"The first VR headset I have owned was PlaystationVR. The Oculus Quest blows the PlayStationVR away! Amazing quality, ease of use and love the growing selection of games and apps. The only thing I would highly suggest is the extra battery and head-strap upgrade.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:02.666178,"Its a fun little unit, and the whole family enjoys it. The setup is fairly easy and the VR experience has really improved since the Rift V1.  The audio isnt great but does the job. Tracking is reasonable considering its all built-in versus having base stations.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:02.666178,"Lens have smudge spots that cannot be remove. Only noticeable with dark backgrounds but overall the picture looks fine. I would recommend getting this one, no need for the extra memory as each game is 3-5gbs. I have about 15 games and still have a ton of space.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:02.666178,"Great upgrade from the older model Rift headset. I use it mostly for seated VR games such as racing and flying games. The upgraded resolution, the addition of the passthrough camera, and wireless link to a PC have allowed extended play sessions to be a breeze.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:02.666178,"Doesn't function. Can't log in with Facebook, and without logging in with Facebook i can't even connect the headset to my phone to start using it. 

Oculus used to be such a great company, but when they were bought by Facebook they lost their customer support.",1,1
2022-05-18 19:36:02.666178,"Fun device for the whole family. If you're bored with your console, grab one of these. From Beat Saber, Resident Evil 4, Star Wars etc. there's something for everyone. I'd recommend to anyone that likes to experience new things and this is a whole other world.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:02.666178,My daughter is in love with this VR set and if I’m being honest so am I. I do not recommend you to play it for hours being that once you take it off it’s hard for your eyes to adjust back to normal lighting.. you will need a Facebook account to set the vr up !,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:02.666178,"I'm a first time VR user and it's a lot of fun for ages 12 and up, from my 12 year old nephew to my 76 year old mother, it's a blast, very happy with purchase, if you are an eyeglass wearer then def. Get the prescription lenses to snap on, it's a game changer.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:02.666178,"I bought this for my boyfriend and our boys for Christmas so we have not gotten to play with it yet. But, reading about it i cant wait to play with it but i dont like that we have to have a facebook account for it to work. I will update review after Christmas.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:03.212919,The game changer was the 120hz capabilities with no wires. Not yet widely available but as long as you get 90+ it feels very smooth. First VR set I wont be returning. So cool to take this in my garage with no PC and not feel like im sacrificing much graphics.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:03.212919,"I love my Oculus, I have thought about a VR headset a long time and checked out the different VR systems available (PS, Steam, etc) this is definitely the best for the price and quality. I recommend to anyone who wants to get into VR gaming or even exercising",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:03.212919,This is an amazing device. So much fun to put yourself in a virtual situation. The graphics are awesome. It’s just as fun to play the game as it is to watch someone else play as they make some pretty funny moves.  Highly suggest for a great gaming experience.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:03.212919,This thing is really fun and some of the games are so real looking. I just hope I get used to them cause after about an hour I start getting motion sickness. That's ok though I'll just make sure I got a trashcan nearby cause I'm definitely not giving them up.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:03.212919,I love the oculus 2 it has great memory and alot of apps and games to choose from. The display is amazing it really makes you feel like you are in the game. The sound and motion follows along with what is on the screen gelping to transport you into that world,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:03.212919,"Got the oculus as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. He’s constantly playing on this, it’s a great investment. It made him really happy. In case you’re thinking about buying a gift for anyone, this should be at the top of your list.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:03.212919,"Bought the Oculus for Xmas and my kids have been playing with it every chance they have. It's better then other systems due to the physical aspects, they've been getting as much exercise playing this then outside in the summer time. So we don't mind as much.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:03.212919,This is my first VR headset.  It is easy to use and has been alot of fun.  There is alot of content available so you won't get bored.  Gave ot 4 stars only because you have to connect it to your facebook account.  Overall great headset and I would recommend.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:03.212919,"I love my Oculus Quest 2, I have one bought several as gifts to my friends and family and also the warranty is a great and thoughtful incentive from BestBuy for all Totaltech support members giving a whole 2 years of support and warranty. Thank you, Bestbuy.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:03.212919,"Well, I notice one thing, they gave me a smaller charger this time. or my 64G model was much bigger and I think a stronger charger.
Bestbuy has done it all right but Facebook is making this device hard to wallow, they track everything with no privacy at all.",1,1
2022-05-18 19:36:03.684555,"Great product. Nicely done for not having to use spacial recognition devices with it. The whole ‘meta verse’ thing still needs a some years of development but a great start. As for the games, love the fps games but would love to more improvement in graphics.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:03.684555,"Oculus Quest 2 is my very first VR headset, and I can finally see what the hype is all about! It's very easy to use and I am impressed on how great the tracking with the two controllers. I really does feel that you are in virtual reality space. I love it!!!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:03.684555,"My son revived this for Christmas/His birthday & it gave bad headaches, nausea, dizziness, excessive sweating, and he didn’t play it long. I definitely do not recommend! I wish I would’ve did my homework on this product please parents plz do your homework..",1,1
2022-05-18 19:36:03.684555,Super easy to set up and use. When you first start take it slow so you do not get VR motion sickness (it is a thing.) When your are done using your Quest do not forget to charge it as the unit will die in roughly 2ish hours. Overall I highly recommend this!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:03.684555,I not really interested in these but don't get me wrong this vr is fun to play video games on but I  am use to having video game  controllers in my hands and nothing on my face  except a mic to talk to people  on guess u can say I am a little old school lol,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:03.684555,Getting together to play with friends is great. I wish there were ways to demo games prior to paying to play.  Needs to charge often so buy a portable backup charger in case you get a warning while playing. Had to buy new head and face part for better fits.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:03.684555,"I bought this to play games on. The battery lasts less than 90 minutes, and it keeps dropping internet connection. I do like how you're not tethered to a system like a PC or PS. Also takes a LONG time to charge, and battery drains when you're not using it.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:03.684555,"VR is awesome. I need had it until now. I have a ps4 VR but this one is better. no wires hanging.totaly on its own. clear and easy to set up and easy to play. plenty of free games and plenty of good pay games. the fit is ok, but I bought the back head band",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:03.684555,"I really love the new oculus. Totally fun and immersive. For 299.99, best gaming deal of 2021 in my opinion. You can easily buy this product,  no long lines and it has a decent amount of games. Just be prepared to buy some AA batteries for the controllers.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:03.684555,"VR is very good if your brain can take it. I cant use it more than 15 minutes. I love the boxing game & going places. 
One issue i am observing is sensor not detected very often, although the lense & clean but it pops up very often,
Otherwise worth the $$",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:04.246887,Coming from the Rift CV1 I can say that this is a good upgrade. Having the VR to be wireless is a huuuge improvement. Its only 4 stars because not all of my Rift games are cross platform (you might need to buy games again if you are coming from the Rift).,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:04.246887,Very interesting device. Works well. I have a problem keeping it sharp and clear. Being nearsighted I thought I'd need no glasses since is right on my face. However. that is not the case and I have to keep adjusting as I use it to keep it sharp and clear.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:04.246887,"I would not recommend buying anything from Oculus!
I had there last Gen VR headset and its a BRICK after just 2 years.
their customer service says they no longer support that device.
Their only advice was ""factory reset"" (which didn't work) and good luck.",1,1
2022-05-18 19:36:04.246887,"This is a really fun system.  It's a great cheap and very high quality for the price.  The only downside is the requiring a facebook account, and those have little in child filters.  On a good note their is something to help with this in the works I hear.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:04.246887,"This thing is awesome. The battery life is a little short, but nothing really to compare it to as it’s the only one of its kind. Buy an active USB-C cable to link to PC to use it as a VR kit for PC games; don’t waste money on the overpriced one from Meta.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:04.246887,Wasn't sure about getting system till a friend got one. Tried it and loved it. Not being tethered to a PC helped in immersion. For those games that require a PC you can get inexpensive cables to hook up. Played Elite:Dangerous on it and it was fantastic.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:04.246887,"I have had it almost a month, and I am truly happy, So happy in fact, my partner legit RIGHT NOW is headed to Bestbuy to purchase her ""early Xmas present"" which is obviously, A Quest 2, After you learn sideloading and Other things. It is worth the money!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:04.246887,"I had been tossing up the idea of getting a VR Headset for some time. I still plan on also picking up the next generation PS5 Headset. In the meantime, I picked up the new Oculus Quest 2. It is SO much fun. I get my workout with Beat Saber (came with the demo and I then purchased the full version), play Super Hot (came with the demo and I then purchased the full version). Super Hot reminds me of being in the Matrix and being able to dodge bullets. The Roller Coaster App makes me a little dizzy, and is better to have a fan going when you play. The eye pieces are adjustable depending on the distance between the eyes (3-positions). I also picked up spacers in case I wear glasses with them. The only downside is that it lasts for about 2 1/2 hours, and takes about as long to charge. You can of course plug it in and use it as well, but you would be limited to how far you can go. I am still tossing up the idea of getting a different head piece. Either way, it is a LOT of fun and would recommend it to anyone who likes to LIVE in the game.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:04.246887,The oculus is the best thing I’ve ever bought! My husband and I each bought one and we absolutely love it! You really feel like in your in a whole new world and we love that we can go into games together and play! It’s worth every penny so just buy it!!!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:04.246887,Bought OCULOUS for my husband for Christmas. The kids and I had a blast with it. Hubby - not so much. His eyeglasses weren’t comfortable under the headset and there aren’t many family games he could play.  I had to return it since it was a gift for him.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:04.731180,"I love this item. Using it for workouts is awesome and I love ""traveling"" the world during this time that it is hard to do in real life. I feel like I have only scratched the surface on what all I can do with this headset. I am still learning everyday.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:04.731180,My daughters love this thing. I haven’t used it as much but I’ve been doing some research and think I may start watching games and fights on it. Not to mention the millions of things to do in the meta verse. Definitely great when you have company over!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:04.731180,"Only drawback is you have to teach yourself and you cannot buy a 2nd pair, link together and play together thru being on same roller coaster, same street,etc...... at the same time.  Should be able to link together 2goggles to see the same experience.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:04.731180,Five stars for now. The system seems to work ok but the docs were a little difficult. The only volume control was a physical one on the device. I couldn’t find the in the vr screen. I do enjoy it and will update my review if I find out any real flaws.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:04.731180,"The Oculus II is amazing and super fun. The setup was easy. It comes with a few free games, but be prepared to purchase additional content. The virtual world is so realistic and immersive. You can even use it to add to your fitness routine. Wonderful!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:04.731180,"This is a great product now that recent updates have not only fixed things but brought a lot of new features and functionality. This is a great stand alone product and also now (after recent updates) it works very well as a wireless or wired PCVR too,",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:04.731180,Words can’t describe how much fun the oculus is. This was my first time playing virtual reality games. It does take sometime to get use to wearing the headset. Also make sure you give yourself plenty of floor space to play. You won’t be disappointed.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:04.731180,"The product arrived in a timely manner. Came out of the box ready to play, although I charged it to make sure it was fully charged before using it. Impressed so far and use it daily as a fitness coach. I travel for a living an use it in hotels daily.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:04.731180,Bought this for the Kiddos but wondering if I might steal it from them! We’ve had a PlayStation VR but now having an oculus we may never go back. The ease of setting it up combined with the safety features and no wires makes it the best VR right now.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:04.731180,"Great Headset for the price, I have an Oculus Rift S and it is amazing, but this is incredible for being on the go, or for doing VR in the living room without any cables. It is compatible with PC VR using the AirLink option or you can use Link Cable.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:05.199822,This is amazing. Got one for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas. My ex husband and I played for 10 minutes and decided we have to get one for ourselves as well. (I also suggest buying and downloading zombieland if youre into that sort of thing :D ),5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:05.199822,Bought this along with the Top Golf game. Very realistic on both driving and putting. Lots of free games and VR destinations from around the world. Feel like you actually there. Next step is to get together with my son and compete against each other.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:05.199822,"I had the original v1 quest and it was great. The redesigned handles on this are better, but I preferred the fit of the v1 on the headset. Other than that it works, and with the free storage and on the refresh why wouldn’t you jump in! the VR works!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:05.199822,"Amazing product, already purchased one the year before for my Daughter. You get sucked into a virtual world with unlimited capabilities!! So this year we got another one for my Son. I plan to get 2 more in the future for myself and my wife as well!!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:05.199822,"If you're planing on buying a vr this is a good deal. Not only its a reasonable price it comes with very good specs. I went from psvr to oculus and there is a difference which alot of people would agree with me on the difference it has is better tracking, better quality, better hz, better fps, more fun games, easy to calibrate. But to all good stuff they do have a con but there arent many cons. Going from psvr to oculus on pavr the motion controllers would talk about 12 or 13 hours to dechagre and the headset never decharges because of the wire(which i find the wire annoying if you move alot on vr) but depending on the oculus controller it mostly dependent on the battery but the con that sucks the most is battery life 3 hours of fun which 3 hours is a while but when you play and have fun that like 30 minutes an hour. But something that happends to me not sure about you guys js the dark gray soft thing on connected to the vr forbme when its only for a bit it starts to itch and hurt a tiny bit. But overall this headset is good recommend.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:05.199822,"Got this for our son. It is really cool. Doesn't matter if you are a gamer or not, it is cool. Lots of games for all kinds of interests. Only downside is you have to have a Facebook account. I REALLY don't like that, but I knew it before purchasing.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:05.199822,"I ordered the Oculus Quest 2 on a whim. As an avid gamer (Xbox), I was really excited to try out the Oculus Quest 2. I have a few minor complaints first: 1, the price and 2, the fact that you have to have a Facebook or meta whatever account. The graphics are also not great, and if I had to purchase a VR headset again I'd save up to get a real one, or I'd wait a few years until better headsets (better quality) are accessible to the average consumer. 

Another annoyance, that sure, was due to my ignorance, was that once you get all set up in your headset, you'll be taken straight to the store where you have to purchase all games for like, 20 plus dollars. I guess it's worth it for avid gamers, but having just spent 300 dollars on the headset, I felt defeated. Xbox has a range of free games and Game Pass, maybe Oculus could do something like that.  

To make everything worse, the remotes I received were cracked. I took it back and got a full refund, but I'm really disappointed because if the remotes had been fine, I'd have kept it. Sad :(",2,2
2022-05-18 19:36:05.199822,After reading many reviews and speaking with the customer service guy we were really excited to try the Oculus Quest 2 out. For the price its awesome and has lots of different games and experiences to choose from. I'm in love with the fishing game!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:05.199822,"So far the product was good I would say a 8/10, I really enjoyed it but at times it is blurry but overall really good also made me feel motion sickness at some times. I would say I enjoyed the experience so far, Beat saber is amazing on it love it!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:05.199822,"Great purchase, love the workouts and very entertaining. What I dont like are some of the apps that want you to pay monthly subscriptions and the head straps are white so they get dirty easily and sometimes when I adjust them they dont stay fitted",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:05.762190,Purchased for my teenage son. He plays on this several hours a week. We have had for over a month now with no issues. Connects great to wifi. Graphics and audio are stunning. Its good for him to not be sitting in a gaming chair and up on his feet.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:05.762190,"A good product and easy to use, the only Problem that I have is setting the boundary on it. It loses connection with the controllers and then you have to reset the boundary again. It gets tiring after the third time. Other than that it’s very fun!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:05.762190,"I was on the fence about this for a very long time. Very glad that I decided to go out and get it. The application of an oculus goes beyond gaming-- you can use it for studying, working, watching netflix and much more. VR is definitely the future.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:05.762190,"Surprised how well this works without a Pc. Not as visually good as my vive cosmos but it does the trick and no tethering. Just wish Facebook hadn’t tied it to Facebook. That’s pure garbage, if you lose your account you lose all games you pay for.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:05.762190,My son loves it! He stays active with it also! Has really nice scenery. I really recommend getting the warranty with it. After a year the vr was just black couldn’t see anything. Thank god for warranty they gave me a new one right away no hassle!,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:05.762190,It was good but I was just looking for something else because I’m in the basement with my brother I can’t have much light in my room and he has one to do I can’t play as much As I would like to and will when I have enough space in the near future,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:05.762190,Amazing buy for entry level VR. Recommend getting an Oculus compatible cable. Bought one on Amazon for around $17. Can now play PCVR games from my desktop and the image quality is miles better. But only if you have a Gaming PC that can handle VR.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:06.246447,The quest 2 is a great entry level vr headset! It’s cheap enough so you don’t beat yourself up if you don’t like it but has the power to bring great quality games straight to your face! This thing is amazing and I can’t wait to buy the next one!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:06.246447,I enjoy the zero cords vs the Valve Index that I’ve mainly been using but the quest definitely is no where near the quality if you have a grand for the index get it. But if you’re looking for cheap VR that’s good I’d 100% recommend this product.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:06.246447,Best electronic gift ever for pre teen and teen nephews and niece! Excitement and use has continued since they have received the Oculus. Ease in setting up via Facebook. Each has their own favorite “virtual reality”! Definitely worth the money!!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:06.246447,bought this for my grandkids I wasn't sure if they would like it or not. Let me tell you the whole family love this from Grandpa to dad to kids. The battery last about two hours and we can easily run it out. Best purchase I have made in a while.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:06.246447,Got 2 of these for my 2 grandsons.  Both just love them.  They’ve stopped playing on their Xbox or PlayStation to play their new Oculus.  They are actually moving and working up a sweat.  Best thing I could have gotten the.  Grampy is the hero.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:06.246447,I think it's not that good yet to spend 300$ on it. Need improve. When my brothers and sisters was playing 5-10 min they was not feeling well after. So be careful with your kids. It's not good when you play more than 10 min. It's my experience.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:06.246447,I use the Oculus mostly for Beat Saber and Supernatural. I love those apps because it's a fun way to get your body moving every day. The only thing that is the head strap is not the most comfortable thing and it's the first thing I swapped out.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:06.246447,"Love it.. even better than a VR place. The sound is clear, graphics amazing and great games. For anyone confused on what they need, this set comes with all you need to play with a good selection of games. My bff even bought it for her kids too.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:06.808822,The product is okay for the first couple months and then after that the batrery dies quicker it takes longer to charge the tracking gets worse and feels laggy tldr would not reccomend buying unless you want a couple months of fun and only that.,2,2
2022-05-18 19:36:06.808822,"Purchased this for my son, he loves it he says its the best. The graphics and vontrols are amazing true VR experience. The safety enhanced features are by far the best part is the abilities to map out and execute safe boundaries and play area.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:06.808822,"Pros: Really fun system to use, very comfortable to wear, large selection of games for all kinds of taste. Can connect to a VR Ready PC for an even bigger selection of games

Cons: battery only last 3-4hrs, can extend if you use a battery pack",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:06.808822,Really fun VR experience. Seems like a quality made product. Is very fun to play around with and lots of games to choose from. The only negative thing might be battery life but if you get yourself a charger pack you can play a good long while.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:06.808822,I bought this on impluse when I couldn't snag a PS5 by Xmas. I regret nothing! The Oculus is a highlight in my home for myself and whenever friends come by to hang out. Now they want to get one so we can all have couch convos together anytime.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:06.808822,By far the best VR headset currently available on the market. The graphics are cutting edge. The headset is comfortable to wear and the battery life is excellent. Overall this is a excellent product and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:06.808822,"Works great, very fun, and engaging. If you're looking to check out VR, this is a great way to get into it. I also recommend getting the elite headset with the battery pack to allow you even more time to play without needing to be plugged in.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:06.808822,"The oculus quest is really fun to use, I just really wish it was better at pcvr. A lot of games are buggy and such but to be expected with experimental gameplay features. Overall its really comfy and isnt too heavy as well as has good quality",4,4

2022-05-18 19:36:07.371189,"I've been a VR user for a number of years, but the hassle of hooking everything up really deterred me from using it. The Quest 2 eliminates that and allows for a pickup and play experience. Super fun and look forward to all the games and fun",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:07.371189,"Though I don’t think that the library of the games are the best and most games are shorter than console game, the experience is amazing! Some of these games are truly immersive and a blast to play! I just wish I had friends who also had one!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:07.371189,"The Oculus Quest 2 is a product I highly recommend. It has high quality visuals, and as someone who gets motion sick quite often from these types of products, I have had almost no issue with this in that regard.  Definitely worth the price!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:07.371189,"Couldnt play it without getting motion sickness. Maybe mwnt for young kids but im 33 and everytine night i gave it 10-20 min of play time, i ended up with a massive headace and feeling sick the rest of the night because of it. Bought a ps4.",1,1
2022-05-18 19:36:07.371189,Visuals are some of the best I have used on any standalone vr system. The controls are super responsive to all movements while also knowing the boundaries around you so you aren’t running into walls haha. Game selection is fantastic as well,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:07.371189,I actually got this for my kids for xmas. They cant put down there computers long enough play around with it. Fine with me. I play it every time I get a chance. Its fantastic and a great escape from the real world. Love it! Very satisfied.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:07.371189,"YES! YES! YES!

Purchased an Oculus Quest 2 for my son after he had been asking and saving money to get. After we purchased his unit, I was impressed with it after I set the unit up for him. 

I turned around and got myself a unit as well!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:07.371189,"Purchased as a gift for a teenager and they love it and have been playing on it everyday for the past week, even the husband likes playing it. There are demos and VR chat rooms to keep the kids busy without having to purchase games for it.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:07.871067,"It’s good, fun and even lets burn some calories while having fun. The free games kind of suck though but the paid games are usually worth it, some even have full storylines like boneworks, in all I’d recommend this item to anyone, 5 stars.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:07.871067,"we bought two of these for our boys so they could do things together.  it has taken some time for one of them to connect while the other has been perfect.  i am sure there is some user error, but it has been more challenging than expected.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:07.871067,"The quality of the sound and pic are the best for such a small unit. Our son spends countless hours laughing and dancing around from the clarity live like videos.  Keeps him active,  instead of just sitting around on a video game console.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:07.871067,"Oculus is a great system.  I have been a convert since the first one and have owned Oculus rift, rift 2, quest and now quest 2.  They have gotten better and better.  The VR community also consists of some really good people. Great device.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:07.871067,I mean it's an Oculus so your review of the headset will vary. I personally LOVE it but find it a bit heavy but ehh... evolution will have to kick in at some point. Nice to have it ready for pick up within hours. See you nerds in the Meta,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:07.871067,"From set up to playing the first game was easy.  Got more games as we got used to.  Some of the downsides were difficulty playing with eye glasses on and playing the games purchased from Google store.  Also, I wish HD quality were better.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:07.871067,"Wow, Pretty awesome...
I got to see this at a friend's place...
I was pretty blown away...

I haven't even scratched the surface so far, so I am looking forward to learning more about it...",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:07.871067,"Really fun- for the whole family.  Surprised by how good the graphics are. Yes, cartoony, but really in-depth theming.  Our teenager has added this to his gaming collection after playing at a friends house and we are all glad that he did!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:07.871067,"The best part is this is lighter than my 64 GB AND they gave me this one as my elite strap broke and the headset fell. Thank goodness for buying the insurance. So, I loved my first  one, this is better with enough memory to for RE and COD",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:07.871067,My son loves this! He had the first Quest and sold it to get this. He says it has better looking graphics. We did need to purchase the strap that they charge $50 to buy. I gave it 4 stars because they should be including it at this price.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:08.417814,"This was a great experience for me and I really loved it and was satisfied…tough you have to buy the games with a credit card and cant use any gift card but except for that all the free as well as paid game are just an amazing experience,",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:08.417814,Love the new VR set! Just made a few upgrades that Oculus makes for them like the head strap and you can enjoy it with everyone at the party comfort and ease. Games are pretty cool and love how I can cast it to a tv for everyone to watch.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:08.417814,"Excellent VR experience.  Easy to use, works well, a lot of fun.  The head strap that comes with it is kind of hard to get a good fit and it squashes too tightly to your face so I recommend buying the elite comfort head strap replacement.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:08.417814,We purchased two of these for our family to play together. We really enjoy Beat Saver and the Walking Dead games. It’s a great work out too! The graphics are phenomenal and the experience is like no other consoles I’ve ever played before.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:08.417814,This VR headset has worked well.  I got a 3rd party headstrap and face cover to make it even better.  It's really fun to play but the games can be expensive and then cost more money to unlock everything in the game once you buy each game.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:08.417814,Excellent experience for me. Happy that I purchased this product. This VR headset is providing hours of escape for me. You want to get away from reality? Purchase this VR headset. The door to a whole new world is open and waiting for you.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:08.417814,"The images are not as crisp as I hoped they would be. I think I would prefer to be watching HD on my TV. But we are going to be giving it a chance. But I suspect it will end up, it a box, on a shelf. Another disappointing Christmas gift…",3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:08.417814,Great for the family. The obly really negative thing i ca. Say is the spacer for glasses (kind of) doesnt work well. They push my glasses into my face. I can still play but usually have to take the oculus off after 2 songs on beat saber.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:08.417814,Oculus isnt my favorite had to bring first quest 2 in then now the second one i exchanged it for its very buggy i have good lighting in my house perfect pc for it and it just keeps kicking me out of every game i try to play linked or not,2,2

2022-05-18 19:36:08.902080,I should give it a 1 cause my bf uses it the most light when I’m trying to sleep sitting there shooting people then the kids fighting over it I now have to buy another one but I rode the roller coaster it was pretty cool so it’s 5 stars,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:08.902080,My son had been wanting this for a while and he loves it! It's a very cool VR set. a little heavy if you use it for too long but very nice. the controllers are also easy to use. You will need to buy games for it but ir's pretty awesome.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:08.902080,Very nice and kids love it. Wish it could move the player by walking in place instead of actually having to walk in an enclosed area. It is nice that it lets you set a boundary so you are alerted if you are going to walk into something.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:08.902080,Both my kids saved up their money for one of these and they love it!  Once they got it all set up with their computers they can't stay off them.  It is nice to see them up and moving around instead of sitting playing games all the time.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:08.902080,All in one unit here it works quite well my only two complaints is the strap it comes with is not very good. Second complaint is the battery only last about 3-4 hours so not bad but a little inconvenient. All in all cant beat the price.,4,4

2022-05-18 19:36:10.885992,"This thing is fun, not my first VR system but the wireless format of this one is quite convenient. The one thing that makes it annoying is that it tends to hurt the cheekbones - tried adjusting it different ways - but still hurts.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:10.885992,"Just couldn't pass on the sound bar amd subwoofer. Our old soundbar was all used up, so when we went looking for a replacement, we just happen to find a newer model, and at a discount too!!! It's a great price for awesome sound!!!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:10.885992,"Best bang-for-the-buck VR headset on the market! Purchased this for my kid for Christmas, he's been playing non-stop ever since. If going to purchase, look into a third party headstrap as the factory one is a little uncomfortable.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:10.885992,This is the best thing I have spent my money on to be honest this is so fun I would recommend it to a friend. you should get it and play some good games like gorilla tag beat saber and a lot of other games I highly recommend this.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:10.885992,Purchased for my grandkids for Christmas but I already have one.  It’s great! I used to have a gaming computer with a HTC Vive.  Depending on the game … this is just as good and it’s lightweight and no cords required.  I love it!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:10.885992,I tried for months to get a PS5 and with each fail I became less interested.  My wife had the idea of getting one of these and now's there's a very good chance I'll be purchasing a second one because the kids will need their own.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:10.885992,When I bought this I was not sure if I would like it but it turned out to be very easy to setup and was not at all what I thought it might be. The quality is amazing for the price and it is the best VR headset I have used so far.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:10.885992,"The Quest 2 is a major improvement coming from CV1 in almost every aspect while being half the price.

It's odd having to add in a Facebook account to maintain and use the headset, but it looks like it'd be removed in the future.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:11.385874,"It was very blurry no matter what I tried to do to correct it. It looks great and I know people who had better experiences than I did, but for me it's a no go. I really wanted to like it, but unfortunately it's getting returned.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:11.385874,its amazing piece.. from my 7yo to my 70yo parents enjoing it.its makes everyone feel jittery inside from the great views to the actual workouts available.. i just wish they did better with the battery life.. hence the 4 stars..,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:11.385874,I am very happy with my purchase I am 74 years old and I really don’t do games I did get it to enjoy seeing other countries by touring it has meant a lot to me I would recommend it to anyone who would like to do the same as I do,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:11.385874,All I can say is wow.  Everything you read or hear can not properly describe how amazing the Oculus is.   Setup is quick and simple.   The visuals and just stunning.  Everything is intuitive and feels natural.  Highly recommend!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:11.385874,"I was lucky to get the last oculus in the store and I couldn’t wait to use it. Setting up the oculus was very easy. I did mines on the oculus app. You need Facebook to activate it but that wasn’t no exception for me. Once it was set up and updated , I did tutorial and under a hour knew how to work it. Im glad I can cast it to tv and air link it to pc. My experience with the games were great. No issues with the games I played on the app. Controls simple and easy to remember. There are two things that I ran into that had hiccups. 

1) buying games. Buying games didn’t work for me when trying to purchase in app. It had to be on the website which that was customer support told me. 

2) steam vr. Now my pc is vr ready but I when run steam vr it’s a little laggy and don’t always show my games. Played one and the display was cut off .it a little shaky to me but it’s nothing but a short fix. 

Oculus is great overall when you really explore it. My only regret  is not getting 256gb. I recommend get a long cord for it though when you still wanna play while charging.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:11.385874,Bought this for my son and he loves it.  Actually the whole family does.  It has definitely given us all hours of entertainment either by playing or watching and laughing at the person playing.  Such a fun virtual gaming system.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:11.385874,WOW!! Didn’t think I was gonna enjoy VR but this takes the cake not gonna lie some games give me motion sickness but most are playable and very enjoyable. My kids won’t let me play bc I don’t know how to get off once I’m on. Lol,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:11.385874,"It was really good and I've used many vr's, this is one of the best vr headsets. There may be more in the future. I would recommend this. I bought 2 for my friend and asked him, he replied: I got dizzy, but got used to it soon.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:11.385874,"Just awesome, flawless and can't believe this was only $300 we ended buying 3 of these.

Using for VR Boxing (Thrill of the Fight) and others are so much fun and pretty much a workout. Meditation and more, super great purchase!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:11.385874,Very easy to use and more realistic than others. Being able to virtually meet up with people and play sports against them in great.  The built in safe zone is easy to set up and works very well. All my family enjoys playing it.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:11.854514,My 13 yo son loves his new birth gift. He upgraded from the oculus go. He plays with it all the time. Definitely a good buy. Only problem is we needed to purchase an additional wire to hook it up to the computer. That cost $80.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:11.854514,Amazing headset with really advanced games on it. Wouldn’t recommend if you have motion sickness. Games are cheap around 10-20 bucks and are really immersive. Very easy to use and setup. It is a lot of fun for anyone of any age,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:11.854514,Definitely better than expected. Total immersion in what ever environment you play in. Make sure you have space or set your guardian before playing. If prone to motion sickness always check the info of the game before purchase.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:11.854514,This product is on another level of entertainment.  Kids got this for Christmas and now they prefer this over their game systems.  I am shortly going to have to get another one because of its constant use between the two kids.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:11.854514,"I purchased this for my 11yr old as a Christmas gift specifically for the game Beat Saber, and we absolutely love it, it is now something the whole family plays. Well definitely be purchasing another Oculus in the near future.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:11.854514,"Good overall, I had fun with it. I wish the lens adjust could be more flexible.
Occasionally there is loud fan noise even though I just turned it on and the device is not hot; able to fix it with a few shakes most of the time.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:11.854514,For the price it’s a great entry point into VR. It is a bit heavy compared to others due to the battery which means the new head strap needs to go. Easy to setup on wireless. I have yet to be able to get it to work with my PC.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:11.854514,These are great. So Realistic . They have come a long way since the first VR days. Headset is a little heavy but you get used to it. Battery lasts about 3 hours of full time usage But overall GREAT PRODUCT. Highly Recommended.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:11.854514,For the few weeks I've had it its been amazing. You might want to have black tape nearby or something to cover the sensor thats in the middle of the oculus because theres a problem with it. But other than that its pretty good.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:12.416882,"Love it, this is a must have! This is the new adult escape. Let the kids have x box, we have VR. Get a referral link before you create your oculus account, you can get a $30 credit for games at the oculus store. See you in VR.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:12.416882,"Very easy to use and setup was a breeze.  Family of four and we all have one so playing games together is a lot of fun.  VR is pretty immersive and, although graphics are not PS5 quality. you do forget you're not on a console.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:12.416882,So fun. The entertainment is endless on here. You just have to use it a little at time before you get used to it. Took me about a month to get use to it. Suggest taking breaks still after you get used to it.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:12.416882,I was skeptical at first because I have pretty much every console that is out. But the Oculus is so much more different and pretty fun and my kid loves it. I would definitely recommend you buy one and test it out for yourself,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:12.416882,"Everyone knows the cons and pros of these by now, so I'll keep this brief.  
I don't remember what exactly the issue was, but I remember that it was big enough for me to end up returning it after three days of ownership and numerous hours spent crawling forums, and reddit and reading complaints of people having the exact same issue as myself.

To quote what I told the CSR when I returned it and they asked ""what the reason for return was?""
My response:  ""It has an issue where occasionally upon bootup it decides to fail to recognize that it's in a safety zone, and you have to create a new one, then it has issues pairing with the controllers as well, and detecting that it's on your head despite having clean sensors, and cameras and being meticulously maintained.  This issue has existed since launch, and it has yet to be resolved.  That's unacceptable, imho as a programmer.""


Sure, it's a better value than the constantly breaking index, and has better resolution than the vive, as well as more portability, but that's all for naught if you can't actually USE it...",3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:12.416882,Can’t believe it doesn't work after ten days. It suddenly became all black with the logo. You can’t even turn it off. Feel lucky it is still returnable and it died after only 5/6 times uses. It brought us lots of fun though.,3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:12.416882,"I love my Oculus … not only is it fun to play alone, but my favorite part is playing with my grown children and grandchildren.  It connects us … young an old can play together and it’s so real you feel like you are together.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:12.416882,Present for my son. He was overjoyed on Christmas. It was easy to get up and running and games were also easy to download. Got few free but paid for full version of some. Still figuring out some things but its a nice system.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:12.416882,Great product just not great for children. Headset is to big and doesn't adjust to smaller heads. Buttons on handles are a little separated for smaller hands as well. This was not made with children or petite people in mind.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:12.416882,Plays good wished they have more games and they need a option available where you can either run off WiFi or. A Ethernet cord in case your out of range of WiFi and  the battery seems to die really fast. Appreciate your time!,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:13.026120,One week using it and the rubber frame that goes around the eyes got loose and there’s no way to put it back. Will bring it back to Best Buy to see if they will replace it or try to fix it. Software is great. Hardware sucks.,3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:13.026120,Tracking keeps dropping coming from vive and rift 1 this is annoying. The on and play is a plus but the lack of apps is also a big draw back haven’t tried air play yet but not having access to steam library is a big drawback,3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:13.026120,I like the idea-but this device is cumbersome to use and tends to crash or reset frequently. As others noted you will get a headache after more than a few minutes of use. We wanted to like this but really not worth the price,2,2
2022-05-18 19:36:13.026120,This is unbelievable I played a game with a roller coaster and I was on my couch I really felt like I was moving and I really felt like I  was on one. This Oculus is amazing I would recommend this if you are looking for a VR,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:13.026120,"really good vr headset for all in one, it handles everything well. Personally wished the battery was larger but having a portable charger takes care of that. It struggles while making the play area when I max out its radius.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:13.026120,"Works perfectly… unless you are prone to motion sickness. Then in that case you’re better off playing video games the standard way. Also, it is a major hassle setting it up to play Steam games however, so that’s a star down.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:13.026120,"Amazing VR It feels very light on the head and the battery last long enough.
Also the game experience it’s really good even to watch movies or Netflix and make you feel like a movie theater are you five stars it’s very good.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:13.026120,"Though the VR is great as far as the VR function goes but to keep on my son's head without eventually sliding down on his face is a struggle. We have tried everything and if an adult is using it, there are no issues to fit.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:13.026120,"A lot more fun then I thought it would be.  The only problem I had was lack of accessories like lense clothe and carrying case, and how the strap that it comes with is really uncomfortable after wearing longer then 10 mins.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:13.026120,"This RV system is amazing! It makes me keep going. I usually live a sedentary life but playing this at least 30 min makes me lose a few calories. Also, the games in this console are pretty budge friendly. I would recommend.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:13.572829,"The only thing I don’t like is how I spent $300 on this and the games are so expensive. Like, if you would want to play a game that would be maybe like $10, it is $30. The glasses spacer also doesn’t really work that well.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:13.572829,"My son loves this.  I played it as well and it’s a lot of fun, I’m almost tempted to buy my own. It’s definitely worth the purchase.  He plays boxing games which leave him sweating later so it’s also a great exercise tool.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:13.572829,"Got this for my son for his Birthday and he loves it.  In fact the whole family loves to play Beat Saber.  I like how you download all the games, so there is no cartridges to store or lose.  I highly recommend this VR set.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:13.572829,My son wanted the oculus system and so far he has loved it. We did have a problem with one of the controllers not connecting but the problem was replaced quickly and without problems. Definitely recommend buying the stand.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:13.572829,this vr headset got me moving again its amazing. i got this quest hoping it would getting moving and it worked worth the $300 alone. but not just that talking to people around the world and seeing there movments is great.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:13.572829,If you have never played VR it will knock your socks off. If you have a gaming pc you can play even more high resolution versions of the game when you pair it with a router connected to your PC. Cannot recommend it enough,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:13.572829,This Is my first VR system and I’m not disappointed. I did my research of the product first like everyone and it’s surpassed my expectations. It’s price point is pretty it’s makes friends and family just have a good time.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:13.572829,"I bought this for his birthday.
My nine year old grand son loves this device. I am not sure of its staying power, but for the past couple days he has played with it continuously. He is excited to play against his friends.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:13.572829,Solid construction. Poor eye spacing mechanism for lenses. Medium clarity. Medium amount of app selection. About what you’d expect for the price. Stand alone and pc vr with out cable is a nice touch which is what sold me.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:13.572829,"One of the most amazing experiences! Gaming in a whole new way! Mind blowing! Can go on and on, the game experience is great and so unlike other systems. Watching Netflix was even awesome and different. Highly recommend!!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.025879,"I love that this car is white and that the headset is not as big as oculus 1, also it is so much more real then the oculus 1 i don’t know how but man it’s like your really there doing this stuff and it is school friendly.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.025879,My son loves it.  Still working.  No issues so far.  Tried it out myself.  Great effects and sense of being elsewhere.  Don't expect the graphics to be on par with the PS5 but the virtual environments are very convincing.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.025879,"Purchased this for my 9 year old grandson , Had to create him a FaceBook account to begin set up which was easy to do as he will only be using it for this.  Wish there were gift card options just for Oculus instead of CC",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.025879,"I got this for my husband, it’s actually really fun. And a great way to exercise indoors when you live in a really state! Only thing is everything costs money and using it for long periods of time can give you a headache",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.025879,"Something fun and new to do during Covid! Stay home fun for everyone in the family. Go places around the world that you'll never get to see. Very cool that you can interact with others around the world in real time, too.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.025879,"I bought this for my son & he loves it.  He’s 15.  It’s funny to watch him play with it.  I see ads for exercise games & different varieties of games, I will one day try them.  It’s expensive but worth it for endless fun",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.025879,Love them! I ordered these through the website and received them in a timely manor! I am having an issue down loading the gift card that came wigh my order but i am sure when i call Best Buy it will get straightened out.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.025879,"Overall fun game, battery life could be better but I dont mind as it limits the kids game time. I know that in time the games will get better and better so im excited to see what is to come. Beat Saber app is a must try!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:14.025879,"Something has to be absolutely outstanding for me to take the time to write a review, and the Oculus is worthy of a 5 star rating. My family loves it, and it is probably the most amazing gaming system I've ever played.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.025879,"This headset exceeded my expectations. I thought ""cool a VR headset"" but it offers so much as far as gaming, tours and experiences. Wish I had gotten it sooner. A recommendation for anyone on the fence. Definitely a buy",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.510141,"It’s a decent VR headset tho wish I could have gotten a rift s instead. Only issue is the battery life, it’s starts to die right as I turn it on for a min. Turn it on after charging it 100% two minutes later it’s at 90%",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:14.510141,"The oculus 2 is fun to use in short sessions. I get tired of wearing the headset after about 45 minutes. Some of the games I’ve played are great. Beat Saber, Eleven table tennis and Walkabout mini golf are my favorites.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:14.510141,"These are awesome for stand alone goggles. Very easy to setup, and adjust. Battery life is a little short, but that is to be expected. Controllers feel great in your hands, and it’s easy to reach the buttons and sticks.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.510141,"Totally mind blowing. Unlike any other VR experience before. Wish I had bought one for my son earlier. From poker to roller coasters, the entire family got to use it over New Year’s Eve  and the reactions are priceless.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.510141,Very cool and surreal VR system. I like the adjustment straps this system has making it fit perfectly allowing the display to be seen clearer. Has a lot of free games you can try and accessing everything is super simple,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.510141,"I was one that was not on board with the VR craze at first. I made a decision to purchase this headset to trst the waters in the VR realm. This has been one of my best purchases this year, for $300 well worth the money.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.510141,Bought 2 to play with the wife and I and now have purchased 8 more to share with the rest of our family. Great way to explore the world and to have fun golfing with friends and meeting new people from around the world.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.510141,"Fantastic game play for family. My wife and sons luv this the moment they laid their hands on it. Totally immersive and the games and control, awesome. Trying to start a new workout routine with this, highly addictive.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.510141,Excellent and very underrated gaming console.  I would recommend for casual gamer and hard core gamer.  Games are very reasonably priced.  Only downside is that it forces you to get a Facebook account so be forewarned.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:14.510141,"Been having alot of fun with this. There’s also piece of mind that with oculus, if u get a game you’re not that fond of. They’ll refund you if play less than a few hours and request it in the few days of first getting.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.947538,"Love the Oculus! I got it to play Supernatural. Everything was easy to set up, with limited instructions. It's all pretty intuitive. 
The headset is pretty comfortable, but if you do physical stuff, get ready to sweat!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.947538,Awesome VR headset. Worth the money. Games are very fun. Took a while to get used to but the tutorials definitely help a lot and are fun to go through. Have played this for hours already within the first couple of days,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.947538,"This is all my 9 year asked for from Santa, it arrived quickly and she loves it. I had no idea that she could play with other friends who had one too. The whole family has joined in. This is the best gift for all ages!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.947538,"Great to be wires free!  The only downside is the graphics capability is much less than the wired Rift headset.  Imagine making a Lambo out of cardboard.  Gameplay is still fun, even if everything looks like cardboard.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.947538,Awsome! The kids and I couldn’t believe how kool this VR was! So much fun and easy to use! Will be getting another one so we can do together and not have to wait for turns. Lol! Very durable and comfortable! Thank you!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.947538,We purchased for our 16 year old son for Christmas. He loves it and we do as well. We tried the roller coaster and got motion sickness just like we do on the real thing. Very impressive Virtual Reality implementation.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.947538,"Best gift I received so far and it doesn't break the bank. 
I was even able to get a PS5 around the same time I got this and since then, I've been using this thing more than anything else.
Great gift for the holidays.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.947538,Got this for the wife and she loves it. Grab a Viveport subscription and have a decent VR capable PC if you want to get the best experience. Still good for a standalone headset though if you want to get into VR cheap.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.947538,My kid loves it. it was on his wish list for his birthday but we were on easy about it due to how much it cost. But we took the leap I’m glad we did. There’s all kinds of fun to be had on it. Even the adults enjoy it.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:14.947538,Love my oculus! Best Buy helped me order and I was able to pick up on the day Best Buy told me to. In fact I received a pick up message earlier than expected. Seamless shopping at Best Buy.  And the Oculus is fire!!!!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:15.541148,My daughter loves her systems she wanted a p5 but couldn’t get it but was a big surprise wen she seen the oculus she cried (a Happpyy Cry) because she wanted a VR for Xmas so I got the next best thang and she loves it,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:15.541148,Quality of pixels can get blurred at times but thats me being picky due to playing on 4k tvs and computer screens but overall its great! Great to play and cast to chromecast so family and friends can see what im doing,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:15.541148,Having a great time exploring the games and experiences available.  Only negative is the head gear that comes with it isn't adequate to counterbalance the weight of the mask so I had to order another one from Amazon.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:15.541148,Fun for the first few weeks then usage goes downhill. Beat saber and job simulator are very fun. Watch your kids when they go into a online chat. There are. I filters and they can hear and speak to just about anyone.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:15.541148,In love but battery level drains fast when your having fun which isn’t bad but wish it had longer battery life  would recommend buying a new strap and a battery pack that’s last 10 hours other then that great product,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:15.541148,Amazing. Best 300$ ive ever spent. I would recommend it to anyone thinking about it. Brand new experience that got me excited to play games again its so immersive. You actually feel like your in the game. 8 thumbs up,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:15.541148,"This thing is a piece of crap.  I am on my second device and both times the amber light flashes stating ""not working correctly"" but nobody to help...  Should be the easiest item to install in the world and make work.",1,1
2022-05-18 19:36:15.541148,"This is the most advanced vr system. Great for kids and adults. Work in your virtual office, watch a movie or be IN the games you play. This is my 4th purchase. I had to get one for my hubby, my bff and my grandkids.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:15.541148,"Excellent, customer support in store, Best Buy is my Only Electronic Shop.  I brought   myGalaxy Note 10+  , my wife buy, Apple 11 pro max  on 2019 samsung TV Q70, on 2020 My quest2 Headset and my sony A7RIII on 2021",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:15.541148,"I love the VR world, but to me I find the oculus store having a lack of games/apps but you can use 3rd party sites to find more. I also think it's kinda blurry and find myself readjusting it to my face fairly often.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:15.994165,This is great for all my kids. Something for everyone. The fun is endless. Great customer service and fast delivery. Easy setup. The white straps on the headset get dirty easily so I would prefer black for the kids.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:15.994165,From the start of the setup it looked pretty good. Only to be let down by Autification of my Facebook couldn't get passed the login also i didn't like the way the controller's feel in your hands and not rechargeable,2,2
2022-05-18 19:36:15.994165,"The advancements in VR are amazing. You get immersed in the game in no time. After playing this you will fully understand the videos of people running into walls, screaming and falling down. It’s a great experience!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:15.994165,The device came packaged very well. The instructions on how to operate aren't very easy to understand. I had watched a youtube video to assist. Highly recommend. The Oculus itself is fun and easy to use once set up.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:15.994165,"VR is so insanely lifelike, even though it looks nothing like the real world when you're in there.  You can get lost for hours in the VR world, be careful.  Really fun, I would suggest everyone try it at least once.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:15.994165,"Pros: Super fun, I like I can do a variety of things like social media, video games, watch TV
Cons: can only play for a limited time before getting a headache. 
Review from a teenager who the gift was purchased for.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:15.994165,"Bought this item for my husband for Christmas. Overall he loves it, one huge downfall especially for what you Pay for device is the fact of how much you pay for the games. Almost comparable to having a gaming system",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:15.994165,"Great entry point into VR. Some people I've let try it still get some motion sickness, but it's far less common than early VR was. The games available are great, though being tethered to Facebook is a bit annoying.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:15.994165,No pc required. Games are not expensive. Be aware of vr sickness though. Yes it is a thing and will most likely happen for the first couple times using the headset. Invest in a longer charging chord from the start.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:15.994165,Really fun experience…I am new to the VR world. It it has been fun to explore this new way of entertainment. Do yourself a favor and buy the more comfortable head strap. Otherwise it becomes a little uncomfortable.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:16.447187,Blew expectations out of the water. Works perfectly and fits comfortably if you adjust it to your head properly. Can easily wear it for the entire duration of the battery life with no discomfort. It is a ton of fun,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:16.447187,"This VR headset is and feels amazing to use! I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to dip their hands into virtual reality, easy to use, easy to setup and also not being tied down by cables is awesome!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:16.447187,"Super fun, easy to set up. Can cast to a compatible TV to show people what you’re doing in VR. Party mode while playing ping pong with friends who are 1000’s of miles away is cool. Top Golf and Beat Sabers are fun!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:16.447187,"Grandson totally loves this, he saved for months to buy it. He is hardly ever doing anything else but playing this, which is not good. He says that it is worth the price. But I say it takes up too much of his life.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:16.447187,We gave this to my son for his 19th birthday. He sent the next 3 weeks using it daily. He loves this headset and really enoys the games that he has been playing. He was excited to bring it back to college with him.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:16.447187,"So much fun!! For someone who’s never used VR this stuff is amazing. Downloaded a fishing game and a boxing game, talk about an unexpected workout (in a great way) if you’re on the fence don’t be! Worth every penny",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:16.447187,"Excellent VR experience every time, pretty easy to use.  Purchased for my husband, i didn't think i would like it but it really is a lot of fun.  Worth it, wish i had purchased the one with the most GB's of memory.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:16.447187,Bought this because my dad had one and it was a ton of fun. The only thing I don't like is that you have to log in with a Facebook account and it's a little difficult to adjust the headstrap if you don't know how.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:16.447187,"All I can say is if you can afford one get it ! For all ages old , or young . Internet connection needed and a Facebook account to activate. Get oculus first steps for free and start there . Happy VRING EVERYONE !",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:16.447187,"When i placed the orders to be shipped to my children up in North, you informed everyday with the progress of the shipping via email. I am so impressed with your efforts with the status. I wish you happy holidays!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:16.915830,"Great product at a good price too. I love everything about it. Gaming, watching movies, videos, or just browsing the web all in 3D without a tv. More content would be nice but new stuff is coming out all the time.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:16.915830,"Very intuitive, and easy to use.  Controller batteries last forever, and headset charges quickly.  Lots of games and video content, but I wish the resolution was better, but that's likely due to the video content.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:16.915830,"We’ve bought an embarrassing number of these in the last year as gifts and for our family, definitely love but it has its limitations in the weight/structure of the headset and battery life.  Still fun and unique.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:16.915830,"We love our VR set!  The graphics are amazing and so life like that in some instances, I had to sit down!!  if you have a real fear of heights, be careful.  Otherwise, we're enjoying the activities and adventures.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:16.915830,I had the older version of this which is no longer supported.  This one is fantastic.  Seems to be quicker and smoother when playing.  Controllers seem to work a bit better as well.  Very happy with this purchase.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:16.915830,Can't say enough about this very fun and immersive! Great choices for apps as well as games and interfacing remotely to lap top or computer is seemless! Wife and I both love this and are probably getting another!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:16.915830,Bought this for my eight year old autistic granddaughter  although experts don’t recommend this for her age I must say this has helped her focus more I’m so happy that I did no regrets fits her head perfectly too,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:16.915830,After buying one for my son for Christmas and trying it out for myself I had to get one. Extremely fun and addicting. Had my fiance try it and she wanted one immediately. She uses the exercise apps every morning.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:16.915830,"Love it!  Gift for my son for his birthday. After having a turn 3 different people were wanting one of their own including me. So much fun
Best Buy had awesome online service and free fast shipping. Very pleased.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:16.915830,Got this so my partner and I could play games together while she was traveling. There isn't a huge crossover between this and PSVR but it certainly worked. If you're interested in VR this is a great way to start.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:17.353194,"Really enjoying the oculus 2. I have the rift so upgrading to this was a no brainer when this version came out to replace the 64GB. It's fantastic, fun, good exercise and so much better not be tethered to my PC.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:17.353194,I love it overall. Dont like that shared accounts cant cast or connect to phone app. I wish I would have known that only the admin can do that. If this problem ever gets addressed I will definatley give 5 stars.,3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:17.353194,Great vR. Love this toy. But I wish the quality was better. They are cool. I think it’s the content out there. But overall all. Great headset plus the value is great. I would buy again. Wish more people had one.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:17.353194,Item itself is pretty cool and well built. But when you put it on to play and try looking around head starts spinning like crazy and that doesn’t go away for couple hours. Because of this had to return the item.,2,2
2022-05-18 19:36:17.353194,This isn’t “perfect” VR but it’s definitely amazing for what it is.  All the cartoony games I’ve played have been great.  Even the tutorial was lots of fun!  So much detail in everything I’ve experienced so far.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:17.353194,Not a bad system but very vulnerable to sweat. Will mess up the display if you swear heavy and wear it too long. This is marketed as a fitness product so you'd think sweat wouldn't play a factor but not it does.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:17.353194,"So fun, at the new 128GB size it was a no brainer to finally make this purchase. Sure, there will be a new version coming soon but this packs a lot of bang for the buck. Very fun to play with family and friends.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:17.353194,Bought as a gift for my daughter. She loved it and immediately 3set it up to work with Steam games. Only issue is the extras you might have to buy like the $80 USB cord if you can't get it to link to your wifi.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:17.353194,Got my oculus 2 delivered and arrived in a day. Had a quick easy set up. And myself and my kids where using the product for hours. And still are using it everyday. Iam impressed by the tech and how easy to use.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:17.353194,Got for my 12 year old for Christmas. He really enjoys it. 1 thing I disliked was that I had to create a Facebook account for this thing. The app feature to buy games from and sync to actual head set is smooth.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:17.806247,"Been one of the coolest purchases ive made, great entertainment and some fun games. A lot of fun with friends only downside is a short battery life, either buy the extended battery or get a long charging cable.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:17.806247,Overall it’s a good headset. I gave it 4 stars because I think they can upgrade the lenses a bit better. Please add another space setting for eyes. It does at times feel like you’re looking through a fish bowl.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:17.806247,I finally decided to pull the trigger on this device and let me tell you that I don’t regret it. It is what I expected for a good entertainment device. It takes you to another world of video gaming experience..,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:17.806247,"I purchased this for my grandson, was worried it was going to be to complicated for him, but this VR system is easy to use and setup. Image quality is very good and controls are accurate with little to no lag.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:17.806247,"Bought this as a Christmas present for my 14 year old son, and I enjoy it as much as him. Will say some games do make me dizzy and others I have no issues with. So it depends on the games how intense they are.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:17.806247,I had a very pleasant shopping experience. I was Christmas shopping and trying to find a game system for my kids and everyone was sold out. I went to Best Buy thinking they were sold out too but they were not.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:17.806247,"Setp takes some work, but its well worth it. My 13yo twins were quickly off exploring the games I'd loaded. Mission ISS and Echo VR were big hits. They didnt touch their phones all night, which was remarkable.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:17.806247,"In the world if woulda coulda shoulda 
Run don't walk to Yes!!! Everyone needs to experience this Oculus. It is truly worth every dime plus! Like Mikey used to say Try it You will Like it!!!!! No regrets here.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:17.806247,The Oculus Quest 2 was a present for my niece(13). They've played Job Simulator and Beat Saber siBnce they opened it up and downloaded the games.  Hoping I didn't make a mistake only getting the 128GB Oculus!,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:17.806247,"Very convenient not having cords that connect to a PC. When paired with the Oculus link cable, works almost identically to the Rift S. Downside is that it requires your PC to have a USB type C port available.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:18.274882,Good product. Have been using it for 2 months now and I have had great experience. Usually use it for a hour or two max. I hope for more game and app development to happen to provide more value in the future.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:18.274882,Excellent VR system. Hard to believe how immersed you can get by being in the “virtual “ world. Great price for what the Quest brings to the table. Not just for children. Plenty of apps for adults to get into,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:18.274882,"Pretty cool but motion sickness pills required for most. 
All VR needs another decade to develop. It has the potential to be awesome (unlike 3D) but it is cool if u have $300 in the 1 w w3disposable income..",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:18.274882,I purchased this for my 12 year old daughter. The whole family loves it and fights over who’s turn it is to play. I wish the battery lasted longer but it meets my expectations for this type of gaming system.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:18.274882,I have both the Quest 2 and the Rift S....the mobility and ease of in - and - out gameplay is unmatched.  Only downside is the amount of charging I have to do with the headset...other than that...it's great.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:18.274882,"The virtual reality is amazing! But for us old folks it takes a minute to get used to it. I myself need to clear out the room before playing, or I’d be falling over everything. It was a good buy! Lots of fun",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:18.274882,My son loves this.  Exactly what he was expecting.  Only issue is that he is sensitive to motion sickness and some games can trigger it.  Those games that are uncomfortable can be refunded easily.  Worth it!,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:18.274882,"It’s fun when I can get it to work. So far, on 3 of the games I’ve bought, I can’t get past the first screen (“Disclaimer “ or “Choose language”) to play the actual game. Very disappointed. May take it back.",1,1
2022-05-18 19:36:18.274882,The lag is unreal and the controllers started drifting after a week of having it. It is impossible to use the headset for a long peroid of time unless you replace the straps. For $300+ I expected a lot more.,2,2
2022-05-18 19:36:18.274882,"Gaming is so much smoother than the PS4 VR. Only complaint I have is the controllers are easy to throw, but you can use hand tracking to control games that don't need buttons, and it's still pretty accurate.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:18.727906,"Gaming is so much smoother than the PS4 VR. Only complaint I have is the controllers are easy to throw, but you can use hand tracking to control games that don't need buttons, and it's still pretty accurate.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:18.727906,"The headset is pretty fun to play with, but it is sometimes hard to find the perfect vision so that it's not blurry. Also, I do have motion sickness related to some games in the quest 2, so just be careful!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:18.727906,Well worth the money. You cannot find a better preforming vr headset for less. The fact that you can play completely untethered from a PC makes it the first real VR set that appeals to a majority of people.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:18.727906,"I bought this for my son and I have to say this thing is really cool. It feels very lifelike and he is enjoying it till no end. One thing I have to say which is why I didn’t give it 5 stars is the initial set up took longer than it should have. After some minor information and connecting to the internet it wants you to download the app to your phone or tablet, then you have to sign in using a FB account. If you don’t have one it prompts you to create one. Then you have to link the app to the headset. There’s also a lengthy firmware update that took about 5-10 minutes. I think the whole thing of creating a FB account stinks because my son did not have one and had no interest in having one but you can’t play without one. They should allow you to just create an Oculus account and move on. I’m sure this is part of Mark Zuckerberg plan to have more FB accounts but it’s pretty lame. If you already have FB then I guess it would have been a less painful set up. Games are cheaper than the other video games, they range from 15-30 dollars and you can order them on the VR set or on the app",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:18.727906,Used this for one day and it went crazy. It just spins around looking for the controllers. I master reset it and still broke. When I returned it there were several people taking theirs back for same reason.,1,1
2022-05-18 19:36:18.727906,Greatest experience ever.  I purchased it for my grandson for Christmas tried it out fell 8n love and purchased another one for him and kept the one I opened. I’ve sold 2 already.  My daughter and my niece.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:18.727906,This is simply amazing.  I bought it from my grandson for his birthday and we have to pull him out of them.  He's up moving around instead of sitting at the computer.  Just make sure you have space.   hehe,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:18.727906,I purchased this for my Grandson who is 15 yrs old. I never thought he would get so involved with it as he has. He's playing with others and having a great time . He loves it !! so glad I got it for him .!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:18.727906,Super fun. Great games that don’t break the bank. It’s a little iffy with steam but once I figured it out just restarting pc and headset will fix any link issue most of the time. You can’t go wrong for 300,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:18.727906,"So much worth the money!
Besides all the VR games, you can play youtube VR, youtube in theatre mode, netflix in theatre mode.
In the future, you may also connect it with PC VR games. It has huge potential.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:19.212165,"The Oculus Quest 2 Virtual Reality Headset has made VR Gaming and the new Metaverse accessible to everyone.  It is completely wireless, comfortable and sells for less than a comparable non-VR game console.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:19.212165,This is so much fun to play with. Our entire family loves it. Games are easy to download and you can even find your friends and interact with them.  I would highly recommend buying an Oculus for Best Buy.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:19.212165,a tad heavy and fogs up when playing.  The graphics are pretty decent. the controllers go through batteries pretty quickly. Had to return for new once since one controller went bad within t he first month,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:19.212165,"This was a gift for my son and he loves it. The picture is great and he can talk to other people while playing, which is fun for him. Games are a decent cost, especially compared to other gaming consoles.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:19.212165,"After owning the first version of Quest, and loving it upgrading just made me live it even more! Bestter resolution, and frame rates keep pushing this platform in to the mainstream! This is the way to go!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:19.212165,My children love this headset. It keeps them entertained and the fact that they can use it to watch all the informational YouTube videos is something I use to my advantage. This be is amazing for all ages,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:19.212165,I hate that barely any games come free every game has to be purchased at $20.00 or more a game and they are not even long so you beat it very quick and it’s not fun to replay especially depending the game,2,2
2022-05-18 19:36:19.212165,"Love it, the only thing that holds me from giving 5 stars would be I only wish there were a little bit better games but the games you get and the amount of the Oculus 2 is worth the price that's for sure!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:19.212165,Unfortunately still requires a Facebook account to set up.  This was a deal breaker for us so we returned for a refund.  May try it again sometime in the future when it doesn’t require a Facebook account.,3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:19.212165,"Definitely money well spent , my kids ages 14, 12, & 8 as well as my self enjoy the oculus . It’s prefect for burning some calories or just relaxing watching movies in the theater setting of your own home",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:19.696427,"This amazing device will transport you to infinite new worlds that you can only imagine. Just buy it now. Highest recommendation for a gaming device. Put down the controller, 2D isn't good enough anymore.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:19.696427,"Return it because its broke no charging anymore, using less then one month, also vision quality is not so good, low resolution, games is expensive,  better to wait when Apple release there own VR headset.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:19.696427,Quality has improved so much over the years. Very happy with this purchase. Adjustments are easy and the product is sturdy. I had a few iterations of the Oculus and am very happy with the quality of this!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:19.696427,"Bought this for my cousin as a Christmas gift, and he/we love it! Submerges you in a totally different world when you have it on, just be mindful that quick motions can cause nausea and a bit of vertigo!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:19.696427,"This has been my first experience with VR and it has been amazing. Such an easy to use headset, and at a reasonable price point. I love the immersive games and definitely get lost in the virtual reality.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:19.696427,Bought this for My fiancé! He loves the games it came with and how realistic it is. I tried one of the games where you’re on like an elevator and you have to jump. I couldn’t jump it looks to real ! Loll,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:19.696427,Love this vr!! I was blown away by it when i first put it on. Much better than i expected.  I wish it was available in different color options. Watching movies/ shows is great but it needs a cinema mode.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:19.696427,I have the first one also and I can say this is a nice upgrade. The weight distribution is better with the stock headband compared to the first one. I did buy the upgraded headband and it is even better.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:19.696427,I returned it after 20 minutes of use. It does not work with my glasses. The glass spacer is useless. I don't want to keep it only to realize that both my glasses and the lens are damaged after one week.,1,1
2022-05-18 19:36:20.180658,"No knock on the device - it worked very well - too well!  I kept getting motion sickness and had to return.  Again, not knocking the product  - it was built very well and performed better than expected.",5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:20.180658,At this point I'm still learning how to use all the different features but I'm pleased with it. I'm pleased to see that many of the games are so affordable. Looking forward to see where it will take me.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:20.180658,I really can't tell you anything about the Oculus right now because it's under the tree wrapped up and I will have to write a review next time around when I use it I think it might be a great investment,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:20.180658,"A very awesome VR product! My son did not stop asking until he got it. Guess what? It was a good purchase. Kids, make sure your parents are aware that you’ll need a Facebook account for the apps needed.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:20.180658,Love this.  It is my go-to exercise equipment for the winter.  I'm having so much fun exercising that it may be my spring and summer go to as well.  Works great and plenty of VR programs to choose from.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:20.180658,"Coolest thing ever.  I had heard very little about VR headsets but when I used one for the first time, I had to get me one.  Best Buy had it in stock and it has been awesome playing with it.  Recommend!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:20.180658,Purchased for my 10 year old and best birthday gift ever we both enjoy it and so many games you can download some free but it’s worth it!! It doesn’t make me motion sickness either which I was afraid of,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:20.180658,"This is my first VR headset! If you are on the fence about VR, this is an excellent entry market product! I was truly caught off guard by the ability of VR and this oculus has been outstanding otherwise",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:20.180658,"I Love Best Buy, Period!  Thank you for always beeing so helpful even when you are out of something that I was looking for (not this time around, you had my Oculus2 Twice (one for my wife, one for me).",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:20.664919,"granddaughter loves it. I bought this for her for Christmas. she has already downloaded alot of games to play on here. Her mom says it makes her dizzy when she tries to play, but mom has glaucoma also.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:20.664919,The best VR experience out there in my opinion. Feels good and looks amazing. I am so addicted to this thing. I recommend getting the adjustable strap ( buy separately) . Beat saber is a must trust me.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:20.664919,First off...this is my first VR and its awesome! But...to sign in you have to use your FB account which is a pain in the butt to do because I couldnt connect to it. Eventually I did after half an hour.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:20.664919,Interesting device. Takes a little getting used to and make sure you have some room around you when you use this. Love the idea I can hook to my. Computer for more visually complicated games and movies,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:20.664919,"Bought This for my kids for Christmas and they loved it, tried it out myself and I also loved it, I game on console but this really blew my mind, is so much fun to enjoy with the family or by yourself.",5,5

expected at least Whatsapp installation in this. a lot of more app innovations are in progress.
many apps have the inside purchases to have this features available",3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:20.664919,I decided to pick up a Quest because I was curious about VR.  It is a whole lot of fun.  Lasso got the necessary accessories to keep the quest and controllers protected.  The game play is so much fun….,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:20.664919,Got it for my son fkr Christmas. Super easy to setup; just need a Facebook account. Lots of fun to play. Wish there was better settings for the vision though; its a little blurry & only has 3 settings.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:20.664919,"I've only played VR a handful of times before, I liked the idea of a standalone unit and decided to give this a try. Its so much fun! Son also tried it and ended up buying one as well. Would recommend",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:20.664919,"The thing would not work on my computer. I wanted it to play MS flight simulator, but my computer did not have enough power to get it to work. Traded it with a friend for their Oculus original verson.",2,2
2022-05-18 19:36:21.117966,"it’s fun for a couple day’s but then it gets extremely dry, it’s the same experience everytime and game’s just aren’t worth it your better off saving your money and buying a console or saving for a pc",2,2
2022-05-18 19:36:21.117966,Definitely good VR for the price point.  I use Oculus Air Link to run Steam VR with a 3080.  Graphic looks great but the tracking isn’t as good as my original vive since they don’t use the lighthouse.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:21.117966,The Perfect Christmas gift. You know a gift is perfect when your receiver cried over and over again to be in possession of one of the most trending items for Christmas 2021. items have arrived on-time,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:21.117966,"Returned, feels like 1080p to me. Extremely not comfortable to wear. Adding all other necessary components making it extremely budget UNfriendly. Better got a decent pc vr if you really want vr gaming",3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:21.117966,"I’ve already experienced VR, But trying on my friends Oculus was a whole new experience, and I knew I had to buy one for myself. An excellent device andR recommend to those new and experienced in VR.",5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:21.617853,This device is the future of gaming and home entertainment in general. I am very impressed with this technology. Definitely worth the money> I almost wished I would have purchased the 256 GB instead.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:21.617853,"I just got it, both of my sons are playing with it for their Steam games joining with their friends online. I bought full price, now is the time to get it with $50 electronic gift card from Best Buy.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:21.617853,A couple weeks ago I had this in Florida with my friends but I came back to New York and it’s not mine so I got one and it’s coming in the mail!! And when I used it in Florida it was really fun too.!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:21.617853,This VR headset is amazing.  I have never experienced anything like this before. The build quality is top notch and the selection in the game library is vast. I would highly recommend this to anyone.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:21.617853,"I enjoys the design and the way the features are set. The only problem I would say I have with this is the fitting on my face and also my head. Even when you adjust the fitting, it still feels weird.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:21.617853,"My daughter asked for an oculus .not knowing what it was …to cut a long story short , I now have 3 ocucluses in my house.speakers work okay but some noice canceling headset will do you better justice",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:21.617853,"Works great most of the time for me, had some issues using the wired connection after a while with some stuttering. But in wireless with virtual desktop it works fine. Good amout of battery life too.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:21.617853,"This thing is so much fun. Beat saber, exorcist and many other fun games. My kids love it as well. They play it until they have to charge it again all the time. I would highly recommend this device.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:21.617853,I have to say I like this then within don’t like about is Facebook account but otherwise it is awesome product I wish there was a way to mute other people if there is I’m not quite sure how to do it,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:22.211465,"It was a birthday present for my child, and he loved it. He says it's fantastic. In the comfort of your own home, you may play games and watch movies on a theater-sized screen. It's very incredible.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:22.211465,"It’s a nice upgrade from the original rift, comparing it to the quest one it’s lighter and faster, only problem is the head strap isn’t quite the most comfortable so I’ve had to buy the elite strap.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:22.211465,"Better than I expected.  I returned it only because I didn't think buying $40 games for 3 hour experiences were worth it.  However, the quality and immersion level were incredible.  Just not for me.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:22.211465,"This was the best (late) Christmas present I could have bought. My daughter spends hours playing games, watching movies in a personal IMAX and actually gets her up out of a chair and off a keyboard.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:22.211465,"We enjoy it. Gets you up and moving. Picture/screen quality is great! Great for a workout. It's heavy, but lightweight at the same time. It's comfortable on your head. You rarely realize it's there.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:22.211465,"The Oculus Quest 2 Advanced Headset brings the action as close as you can get to the concept of virtual reality portrayed in the movie ""Ready Player One"". It is in-your-face gaming and loads of fun.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:22.211465,"Loved it, only the battery does not last long, sound it’s great, and controls need AA batteries, I would buy rechargeable to avoid buying constantly, but other then that this is an awesome product!!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:22.211465,"Really amazing,  but hate the fact I supported Mark Zuckerberg by buying this.
Vr is well on its way to take over other gaming platforms.
Id wait for new modela announced before I'd buy another one.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:22.211465,Great product. I should’ve looked to see what games they all had first though. Not too many games that peak my interest but fun to play for about a half hour everyday. 30 min feels like hours in VR,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:22.211465,"If you get locked out of your Facebook account, then this becomes a paperweight.  Oculus support will no longer help you get back in and Facebook support is completely useless for account recovery.",1,1
2022-05-18 19:36:22.648861,Was amazed at the platform in general. First time VR experience. Make sure you have enough room to play as it's not nearly as fun if you don't get to get into it without fear if running into things,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:22.648861,"This is lots of fun.  Great variety of games.  I love it and my 10 year old loves it.  Great for fitness, gaming and of course watching favorite shows.  Great way to watch a NBA game on the court.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:22.648861,This was the toy of the year! My grandson enjoyed it so much that I had to get one for my granddaughter. Then her father took it over…so much fun to use and so much fun to watch everyone using it!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:22.648861,Omg!   I find this totally amazing. The price was great $299.99 plus 50$ Best Buy gift card. Plus 6 months interest free financing.  It’s so fun to play and laugh when someone else is playing it!!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:22.648861,"So fun to play with, battery lasts about an hour, which isn't bad. I would auggest purchasing the new headpiece accessory as it makes the intire thing fit better on your head. Would puchase again.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:22.648861,It's a very affordable headset that requires little in the ways of set up. It's portable and easy to use anywhere in my house. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking into investing in VR.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:22.648861,So much fun and very amazing if you've never played a good VR before. Works great and definitely recommend upgrading to the elite strap upgrade or another brand.  It will make it more comfortable.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:22.648861,Thought I would give this as a family present and it was way better than I could have imagined!!! Well worth the money and the months that it will take to explore all that it can do. So many uses.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:22.648861,It’s fun to have if you can find the right game to play with it. I should’ve done more research for myself. They should have games that’s not that expensive. Do you’re research prior to purchasing,3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:22.648861,First VR experience at home and so far it's great. It's being enjoyed by young and old in our household and the set up was a breeze. So many great things to explore it was definitely a great buy.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:23.211232,"I really enjoy the oculus quest. Definitely a step up from the psvr. Quality is great and given the price, this vr is the best bang for your buck. The only flaw is the battery life isn’t the best",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:23.211232,"Better than I expected!  This was my first true VR experience and it was awesome.  The battery life is real short, I purchased the additional headstrap with battery and it made a huge difference.",5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:23.211232,"This is one of the BEST gaming systems I’ve ever purchased, and I’ve purchased just about all of them over the years! I especially love the way it makes us get up and move around for our health!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:23.211232,This device is loads of fun. It has games for all ages and interests. Relatively easy to set up and get going. It doesn't need another device so it travels well. It does need a facebook account.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:23.211232,"Great System! Bought as a gift for grandchild but it is used and enjoyed by entire family. From entertaining and challenging gaming, to fitness, there is something for everyone with this system.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:23.211232,"Fun, easy, wireless..? With the capability to link to a PC for greater processing but i don’t need that. Works beautifully for my needs… synthriders is the best, many hours of fun on this so far",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:23.211232,This was the best investment ever! My kid loves it and I can barely keep her off of it! We will definitely be purchasing another one so that we can play together! This really is worth the money.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:23.664249,Works much better than expected!  An awesome upgrade compared to my old Oculus.  No screen door effect with the optics and I can play all my old games wirelessly from my PC which was unexpected.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:23.664249,"This is my third time purchasing an Oculus Quest 2 from Best Buy! 2 as gifts, and one for myself. Curbside pickup is super quick and efficient, and my order was ready within an hour of ordering.",5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:23.664249,Man! this is fantastic! You will have so much fun with this one. We love it and cant wait to do more with it. It did take some getting use to and one of us could only play with it sitting down.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:23.664249,"I love my VR device. I am a senior citizen and it's so much fun and so relaxing to be able to just get away by virtual reality, ride a roller coaster or play a game. I recommend it and love it!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:23.664249,"Bought one each for my boys, 13 and 16, so they would have to argue and share the oculus. Both boys love it. They play games with their friends. I Easy to set up, but requires Facebook account.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:23.664249,"Purchased for 22 year old son, he loves it we all played very interesting system toddler now wants one for his birthday, careful if you are a person who gets motion sickness the falls feel real",5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:23.664249,I love my VR headset. It gets you up and moving so you exercise without trying to exercise. About seven of my family members have headsets so we have different types of VR parties like bowling.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:24.117267,Love the free 360 visits to Europe apps I feel like I’ve been to places I never even heard of. It’s like being on vacation at home .  The bowling and shooting apps are fabulous.  Love my Oculus,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:24.117267,These was an upgrade from the Oculus Go and well worth the price. Awesome VR games and experiences. Really enjoy that you can create a virtual wall to keep you safe from hazards while playing.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:24.117267,"I’d recommend buying it
Only problem I’ve had is that my games disappeared one time when I came home from work but I connected it to the internet and then they all came back
Only happened once",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:24.117267,Fun little set up. It's not the most powerful vr out but it's a stand alone that gets the job done for a great price if you are looking at vr and don't want to spend 1k definitely go with this,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:24.117267,"I purchased this for my son to use as a training aid in baseball. I am not disappointed. It is a great training platform for the bad weather days, and it makes his screen time more productive.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:24.117267,The fact that this is wireless has me sold. The image quality is not bad and you can tell it is a stepping stone to something greater. I look forward to seeing what comes next in the VR space.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:24.117267,"The Oculus is a very cool 3-D game, it offers so much it's hard to put it down. I like to see a Oculus that the hand held devices are not needed and the players hands are used to do everything",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:24.117267,Awesome device! The 3r visuals are amazing! Kids love it and me and the wife enjoy as well. A couple of good free games. The rest you would to pay in the app. I guess that’s the only down side,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:24.117267,"I got this for my friend so he could play VR with us and I’ve gotta say, it was the best purchase I’ve made in awhile. It’s been loads of fun and now he can bring it over whenever we hang out.",5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:24.570253,We bought this for the kids but we love it too!  Definitely a great gift for the whole family. I would recommend buying a few games that interest everyone (online purchases through the Oculus),5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:24.570253,Really like the oculus it's fun and entertaining for the whole family. Has many different games so far the saber and climbing ones are my favorite but still getting used to other games I have.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:24.570253,This purchase was for my son and he has had this on his head almost every day! It’s awesome the only thing I would say is I wish they had more free games avail or lower prices would also help.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:24.570253,Its a really great vr headset in my opinion. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is that the tracking gets a little weird and glitchy somthimes. Other that that it's been amazing.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:24.570253,"Best gaming experience ever, my only issue is i get nausua when i play any standing game, so if you have vertigo or motion sickness its not for you,unless you want to stuck with specific games",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:24.570253,Our family loves this!!!!!! Was hesitant about purchasing because my funds were low but it's definitely worth the money. Hours and hours of fun for all ages. I think the adults like it more!!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:24.570253,It’s pretty good if you replace the head strap with a third party one as the one that comes with the headset feels uncomfortable like it’s going to fall off and very hard to adjust correctly.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:24.570253,"It was an amazing experience using Óculos, when I took it off, it was a little disappointing to come back to reality LOL ! Such great imaging, really feels like what you are seeing is reality",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:24.570253,"Amazing value, its brought me back into gaming. I used the OG dev kit 2 and to see how far its come in just a few years is astonishing. at 300, if you have the money pick it up. well worth it",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:24.570253,I was hesitant about this but my kids wanted it as a gift. Upon trying it out myself I was blown away by how incredible it was. I will be sneaking off when the kids are in bed to play myself!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:25.038894,"love my oculus 2.  i had ps4 vr, this is better because im not tethered to the console.  i also like the games for this.  big fan of star wars and theres quite a few star wars games for this.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:25.038894,This unit is one of the best so far. Facebook (Meta) is really trying to expand VR. It was a Christmas gift for my 12 year old son. He didn’t seem to play it much so we returned it for a PS5.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:25.038894,"We bought 2 of them for our kids this holiday. They love it, and secretly so do I. Havent had a chance to really use it much but just putting it on makes you feel like you are somewhere else.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:25.038894,I ordered online to pick it up in store but it just a waste of time waiting for nothing.. happened to me twice with best buy! They don't update you when they have cancelled it. Disgusting!,1,1
2022-05-18 19:36:25.038894,Vr where have you been all my life is what I have been say since I made my purchase. vr goggles are so life like. It’s fun educational at the same time. I am very satisfied with my purchase.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:25.038894,"A gift for our son and he loves it. Pretty easy to use and so far the battery life has been fantastic.

We’re very happy with this purchase and the variety of games available for the system.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:25.038894,Best thing I have every purchased. One down side is that the battery dies within 3-4 hours but that’s enough if you take break and charge it. Other than that it’s perfect for the Meta-verse!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:25.038894,My son loves his quest 2.  He still kept his quest 1 but plays with this one more and leaves his older one for guests to play with joining in on games.  He says its more comfortable to wear.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:25.038894,"SO much fun, I hate that I like it b/c I am so against facebook haha. But this thing is a lot of fun for the entire family, lord only knows what data they are collecting, but it sure is fun!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:25.038894,I'm still excited when I use my VR system.  When I rode the roller coaster I had to use a chair because the ride felt so realistic.  After today my Playstation just plays my blueray movies!!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:25.476324,Had an original and was hesitant to upgrade but I’m very glad I did! 50% more pixels makes a huge difference!! And the speakers are louder which is great since Beat Saber gets tons of play!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:25.476324,I have been playing almost every single day since I’ve gotten this. It is nothing but amazing and it’s a great gift to get your partner or your kid. Plus it’s a pretty fun way to be active!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:25.476324,The product works great and there have been no issues. Setup was easy. The quality of the product is very high as well. Some not familiar with VR should be able to set this up easy as well.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:25.476324,"An excellent choice for the teenage children, The VR world is amazing, Comfortable and easy to use and fun for the whole family! Just watching it being used causes a great deal of laughter.",5,5

***** package was delivered in the original box.   Everyone could see exactly what this was , including my son and anyone looking to steal it. *****",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:25.476324,If you havent experienced VR yet you must try it out...its amazing..my daughter was so excited to get this for Christmas the only problem Im having is I cant get her off the VR Headset lol,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:25.476324,I was contemplating on getting the Quest 2 but finally caved in because of the Black Friday deal. The experience is amazing especially because it's a stand alone device and fully wireless.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:26.023072,"Kids like it a lot 
Haven’t tried many games yet but the tech seems to work well
Only negative I’ve noticed is registration process is a bit of a mess 
Remember it’s Facebook owned product",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:26.023072,So far so good. Bought it for flying MS Flight Sim 2020 and a few other games. My first VR and liking it. Will add more games and flight sims as I go. Of course the grand kids love it lol!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:26.023072,I bought this as a gift for my husband and he and our friends have been having a blast using it. Works great. He has been watching YouTube videos to figure out which games he wants to buy.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:26.023072,"For a last minute gift idea, this one is the item that ALL the kids are still playing and raving about long after the tree burned down. Highly recommended to take away from the depression.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:26.023072,"Tons of fun and was really easy to set up. We really enjoy it! It is also very safe because when you get out of the ""boundaries"" of the games, then you can see the surroundings around you.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:26.023072,This headset is amazing!! It comes with everything you need to start VR and can operate completely on its own. The headset is comfortable way and portable. Its a great headset all around.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:26.023072,"One of the best tech products I have bought in a long long time. It was super hyped and at first, I didn't think it would be this good but I am amazed by the experience. I recommended it.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:26.023072,It has a lot of free games and so fun! I only got rid of it because we just bought a new monitor and have been gaming hard.. has a lot of free games and cool experiences highly recommend!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:26.023072,2 stars because they literally force you to use a Facebook account to use the thing. Otherwise it’s a great VR set for the price and completely independent so no wires or computer needed.,2,2
2022-05-18 19:36:26.460469,"My girls love this. They do struggle sometimes with keeping balanced while playing games with movement, but it’s great to have “toy” options that also over exercise for the entire family.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:26.460469,We bought this set over a month ago and been playing ever since. New worlds and dimensions discoveredc super fun! It holds battery well and we just now replaced batteries in the joysticks,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:26.460469,With quarantining and not being able to be around all of your friends this has been awesome to hang out in spaces in Horizon world. I even build my own world just to hang out with people.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:26.460469,Surprisingly Fun got this to play games with my brother. Adjusting to the VR takes a while and i cant play as long usually get a little headache after an hour or more of consistent gaming,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:26.460469,"Bought this item for my 16 year old son for Christmas.  He loves it!  Seems to be a quality product, but we've only been using it for a week so we don't have any details on the longevity.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:26.460469,Fun for the entire family and no need for extra equipment. We take this on our family travels. Fun fun fun and i have several meditation and relaxation activities. We absolutely love it!!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:26.460469,pickup is amazing. I simply ordered and it was available less than one hour later ready to go. The oculus itself is amazing and I’ll absolutely buy again. The staff was also very helpful,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:26.460469,"I thought it would be better. Always have issues connecting to Wi-Fi so I had to use my phone’s hotspot every time. Other than that, it was a good experience but not worth it to keep it.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:26.460469,"Awesome. Great value for a vr headset. Every game costs money of course. Very few are free. Games are kind of short but they are , for the most part AMAZING. Played Star Wars. INCREDIBLE",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:26.460469,Son liked his birthday gift but felt like the standard headstrap had to much pull.  We changed it to the elite strap which fits much better but that was a real pain in the but to change.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.038458,First VR headset bought it to go with My gaming pc definitely reached my expectations got this so I can have something that is a stand alone system too and this reached its expectations!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.038458,What can I say?? This VR headset is the best out there on the market. You dont need a 1000 dollar PC to power it and you still get an amazing experience with a great selection of games!!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.038458,Amazing! I was hesitant at first but when I tried it myself I was impressed. I can’t wait for more rpg games to come out! It’s addicting! My kids love it and was the best Christmas gift.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.038458,Didn't fit my wife Asian face too well. Seemed to be a few inches too narrow. Glasses couldn't fit while wearing headset. Graphics aren't that impressive. I returned the day I bought it.,2,2
2022-05-18 19:36:27.038458,"Never having used VR gaming outside of an expensive commercial setting, I was uncertain if I would like this. However, the Oculus is a great platform which has exceeded my expectations.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.038458,Awesome toy for the kids....offers great workout games for adults...takes a bit to get acclimated to ....make sure you set and re check your boundaries before you go slamming into walls,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.038458,"I wasn't expecting to feel like I was transported to another reality, but the oculus does exactly that.   Forget ps5, this is far better,  with cheaper and much more entertaining games.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.038458,It’s honestly pretty fun to play with especially with friends the things that I don’t really like is the head strap and how the battery last a couple hours but I rate this a 4 out of 5.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:27.038458,Comes with a glasses spacer and and a silicone cover for the foam padding visuals can be blurry at times but only when i was looking for the blur otherwise a great product for the price,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.038458,"This is so much fun for the whole family. We only had one issue, the right controller stopped working after about 2 weeks. Customer service at Oculus had us send it back in for repairs.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:27.475863,Great device my son absolutely loves his oculus he’s it on it everyday and honestly keeps if active and sometimes even like he’s working out much more beneficial then a sitting console!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.475863,It's a very nice device and provide hours of entertainment for the kiddos.  I wish the device itself would be able to communicate with consoles and be leveraged as a third party add-on.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.475863,Kids love it. Sometimes it glitches and we have to restart it. Only complaint is that the remotes require batteries. I feel it would be easier if you could charge them like the headset.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:27.475863,"My complaint i have is that you have to buy upgrades to make it better when they could have just made it the right way...for example the straps, the battery and most games are expensive",3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:27.475863,I bought this with the oculus cable to connect to my pc and it’s a game changer! Games that i have on steam that have be support are getting a revisit and it’s honestly a great change!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.475863,"Best VR experience that I have ever had! Easy to use, comfortable headset, decent battery life, and casting your in-game feed to a nearby TV for others to see is a really nice feature.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.475863,We got this for my so for Christmas.  He loves it!  He has played it almost nonstop!  He bought a few games to play and there are a few free games they have offered.  Highly recommend.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.475863,My son loves this product.  It is so much fun to use .  I will say as an adult that wears glasses it is hard to adjust to my virtual surroundings but this does not phase my son at all.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:27.475863,my daughter loves this.  She is in a wheelchair and has difficulty traveling but has been able to see many of the wonders of the world for free and she says it feels like she is there.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.475863,I love this product! However if you deal with nausea very easily or migraines I don't recommend it. After using it for a couple of minutes I'm very nauseous. Other than that it's great,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.944464,An amazing experience.  My wide uses the Oculus every morning for her workout and the kids play games.  The graphics are excellent and the sound helps to immerse you in the experience.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.944464,Great gaming system. Kids and adults will enjoy non stop entertainment. Some games are Free BUT you will have to purchase the exciting and poplar games just as any other gaming system.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.944464,Good VR. The only thing they need to work on is the headsets adjustment straps. Seems like everyone including myself has trouble getting it to a position that it will operate properly.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:27.944464,"I went in and couldn’t find the Oculus. I asked a worker if he knew if there was any left, He went to the back to check and there was one left! Great product which I absolutely love!!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.944464,The Oculus Quest 2 is awesome!  The all-in-one virtual reality headset does exactly what it was designed to do.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a gaming system.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.944464,Great purchase for my niece! She loves it.. when i purchased this for her christmas gift i had no idea you can also watch movies and your sitting in a theater.. Now i gotta get me one,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.944464,Excellent gadget for the price. The only downside I have come across is that our 7 year has a hard time comfortably reaching all of the buttons unless he holds it a very specific way.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.944464,Bought the Quest 2 to help my wife rehab from a spinal fusion. Beat Saber has helped her tremendously with her core and upper body. She is almost ready to go back to the normal Gym!!!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:27.944464,It's a fun game system. You really can believe its reality.  It takes a little ro learn. Once you get used to it you'll love it. I think i should have gotten the one with more memory.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:27.944464,"Built-in demo is awesome.  Works with my games.  Stores everything in internal memory, so no lag.  Easy to set boundaries to limit movement to available space.  Works over my glasses.",5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:28.397514,Very interesting. Lots of games / activities that are reasonable in price. I am enjoying it. Good value for the price. Instructions are sparse but setup and play are fairly intuitive.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:28.397514,Purchase was easy online and so was curbside pickup. Couldn’t get easier!  We also love the Oculus 2. Would recommend for entertainment or even working out. Fun for the whole family.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:28.397514,My 10 year old bought this with his saved money and I'm mad we didn't get it sooner. It's a lot of fun for all of us. There's many different games so we all found something we enjoy.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:28.397514,"Love this thing best present ever.  Shipped on time, great quality and content. Worth the price. They need to work on the strap system but other than that everything else is awesome.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:28.397514,"I bought this for my kids for Christmas, they love playing.  Some of the games are so realistic.  It is fun, they love video games and I love that they are up moving.  Best for both!",5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:28.397514,10 ur old LOVES IT! Keeps him active and it’s pretty entertains and fun for me as well. It’s something new for both of us. Well worth it… especially when you see his smile and laugh!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:28.397514,I purchased this just for resident evil... i have the oculus one... and its not much different to me.. good thing tho i can use my controller grips and vr power battery with the 2...,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:28.944260,"I absolutely loooove using my oculus. I’ve been using it to box and I really feel like I get a good sweat out of it. No complaints yet, battery is good but I don’t spend hours on it",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:28.944260,"This is the new way to game and get some exercise at home. Once your equilibrium gets used to it, you will have a blast and I recommend it to anyone that wants to try something new.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:28.944260,Wow an amazing VR headset so much fun for all ages. I’m a hardcore gamer and definitely was blown away by the awesome you get with this headset. What are you waiting for buy it now.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:28.944260,"It’s still a screen so limited time is good but boy do they move. The beat saber game gets em’ going. All in all, pretty fun for the whole family. I just wish Oculus had gift cards.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:28.944260,I was a little skeptical to purchase I’m glad I did it is great fun and very addicting games are great on it I did have to buy the extra battery but overall I recommend this product,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:28.944260,"This has been a great purchase! Keep my family entertained for hours, both kids and adults alike. I love riding the rollercoasters and playing mini golf, creates a great experience.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:28.944260,"BEWARE: This game causes motion sickness! This was a hit for my kids, 9 and 12 but by day 2 they were both throwing up. I’m now limiting their playing sessions hopefully it’ll help.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:28.944260,"After buying it as a birthday present for his younger brother and then playing with it for a while, my older son requested one for his own birthday as well, so obviously he liked it",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:28.944260,"Best time I have had with any electronic device , best thing for families , needs more games but still a good device. Really good for Christmas or birthday gifts. Highly recommended",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:29.414554,all good but the only bad thing was the person who delivered the package who threw the package did not leave it at the door lousy bad service they should be more careful with things,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:29.414554,I love this. I have the oculus quest and decided to get the quest 2 and I am happy I did. Although you have to charge it more than I did with the oculus the graphics are much better,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:29.414554,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister and brother in law. They loved it. I had fun playing with it too! You can even play with your friends who owns it and chat over the VR!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:29.414554,My oldest son purchased an Oculus and my middle son loved it so much that we bought him one for Xmas.  Now they can both play oculus and be engaged with a little physical activity.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:29.414554,"Quest 2 has much better experience compared to Play Station VR.
Love the way it works standalone too.
Only complaint is fitting, as the included head band isn't really comfortable.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:29.414554,My son (11) loves this and the fact that he can interact with his friends on it. Keeps him busy and entertained when he is stuck in doors. Also not a bad way to get his energy out!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:29.414554,"This is a first time user of the Oculus, having started with the HTC, there is a bit of a learning curve with the controls.  Great as a stand alone VR tool, that is a nice feature.",4,4

2022-05-18 19:36:29.876665,Awesome! Glad I got it. Its fun for the whole family and great for working out. Definitely tired after a few rounds of boxing. Its fun laughing at people playing some of the games.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:29.876665,Excellent headset game. Works great sound is excellent and very durable. it will definitely keep you busy. Be careful it can be costly for the games that you need to purchase,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:29.876665,It's unbelievable how realistic some of the visuals are displayed. My family is enjoying this very much. My son gets a great workout every day and doesn't have to leave the house.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:29.876665,"Unbelievable experince & entertainment. Both my kids bought these and Ive tried them, using a zombie (Walking Dead) game they bought...unreal experience, graphics & immersiveness.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:29.876665,"Weak resolution. You need Oculus link and a very strong PC if you want a good trip.

Do not forget, they don't refund your purchase if you wanr to return it.

Very CHEAP..........",1,1

Best Buy employee “Nick” at the Saratoga Springs, NY location is the best!!!!!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:29.876665,"Just amazing. Things to improve? Battery life, the way it holds your hear. Some foam in the nose please. The games are way expensive than steam, can't tell why so much difference.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:29.876665,"My son loves this system.  Very fun and easy to play games yet still
Challenging.  Love that you charge it and wear it.  He is comfy in the headset even though he is special needs",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:29.876665,"Fun product.  The games may not be as involving, but they are much cheaper than other gaming systems.  My only complaint is that the head straps become uncomfortable after awhile.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:30.345306,"This is a decent headset. Jay usually can wear for about an hour, after that I could get pretty uncomfortable because of the pressure points that has said can put around the head.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:30.345306,Great purchase! Really enjoy the gaming without wires. Only bad thing is the battery life but was able to find a 3rd party battery pack that doesn't take away from the experience.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:30.345306,"Definitely is fun I would recommend for sure the only thing I say negative about this is the head strap at times but not, a big issue, and that you have to use face book to log in",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:30.345306,"Lots of fun, great game selection but very few demos to try the game. Battery life not great and prepare to spend $100 on a better head strap, the one that comes with it is trash.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:30.345306,It’s awesome super fun. Also keeps kids moving and it’s like being right there in real life with every scene. I just don’t like how it keeps getting a black screen every so often.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:30.345306,"The Oculus Quest 2 is way more fun than I thought it was going to be. I only have Beats Saber, for now, but that game is crazy fun.  It's a must have if you get an Oculus Quest 2.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:30.345306,"I did not expect to so impressed with this VR headset as I was. From what I’ve seen, this has to be the best all in one headset you can buy today, nothing else matches the value.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:30.345306,Works really well once you figure it out. It is front heavy so a counter weight like an extra battery pack will help. Allows me to visit places I may never get to visit in person,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:30.345306,I was skeptical when buying this as a Xmas gift for my son but he loves it and frankly when I tried it out…mind blowing. The experience is really engrossing and quite impressive.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:30.345306,Fun game that allows you to be immersed in almost real sensation.  Easy to operate controls and absolutely fun to experience the action scenes in the games.  So much fun to play.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:30.829568,"Surreal. Interactive. Fun. Exciting.
I bought this to add a different kind of experience to weekends and leisure  time at home. This actually over delivered. Well worth the money",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:30.829568,"The Oculus 2 is a great buy.  Graphics are amazing. Love that you don’t need a phone, the software is within the headset. Not sure if I said that right. Great multiplayer action.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:30.829568,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. He really enjoys the virtual experiences as he feels like he’s actually in the scenes. I tried it and it was life-like and exciting.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:30.829568,"Took some getting used to, but the details in this system is 2nd to none. The best in VR; you truly feel like you're in the system. I look forward to adding more apps to explore.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:30.829568,I never thought that I was gonna have this type of experience with VR. I am a noob to the VR world and let me tell you that I have not picked up the control ro my PS4 ever since.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:30.829568,"Very cool and easy to set up, purchase games etc. purchased for our teen for Christmas abs he loves it!! I’ve used it without any motion sickness which I’ve had with some VR sets",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:30.829568,"Fun, easy to set up.  More addictive than you would think. Start with short play sessions until you get used to it to avoid motion sickness. Invest in an after market head strap.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:30.829568,"Great graphics upgrade from the original. Much faster too. I would have gone 5 stars but they changed the head strap, and it's a little harder to use without smearing the lenses.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:30.829568,"Would be truly amazing if there were more/better game options. All the games my son wants to play are not accessible through this product.
It is also really hard to turn it off.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:30.829568,Bought for our son for Christmas. Figured why not another electronic toy for this generation right. Let me just say it’s for everyone we all use it. Very different and enjoyable,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:31.282587,"I'm a PCVR enthusiast. Never gave  the quest a fair shake, and now I see I should have gotten one sooner. The simplicity of just putting it on a playing fun titles sells itself.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:31.282587,There are shortcomings that are understandable. The positioning of the lenses and the strap. But after market has a good number of alternatives to help push the quest to a five.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:31.282587,Excellent product. Kids enjoy it. We have twins and had to purchase two. Still trying to figure how how the can both use them without any issues or having to open a new account.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:31.282587,My grandson loves it! He asked me to try it and I couldn't believe how such a small gadget could have such big space and how real life it was. It's also funny watching him play!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:31.282587,"Occulus Quest 2 -
Enjoy the games a lot! Setup was a little more complicated than I expected, but after getting a little help it was not so bad and I enjoy my new toy very much!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:31.282587,Great VR!  I love shopping at Best Buy! Saved $50 dollars on device and I needed it because games are expensive.  I brought 2 and you got purchase games twice for same household,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:31.282587,"What a fun headset. VR games still feel very early-development, so there isn't a huge abundance of options.
I'm excited to see what games come soon, and how the headsets evolve.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:31.282587,This is an excellent product. Glad I purchased it. My kids and I really enjoy the many  virtual  games it offers.  You will need room to use it so that you don't wreck your home,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:31.282587,My first VR set and this did not disappoint. Not really a fan of having to link my FB account but whatever. Really enjoy the ease of use and how I can dive right into VR gaming.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:31.282587,My children and my husband love this product Because it has good games that you could exercise too and sweat a lot and it's fun I guess for that for them to challenge each other,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:31.704363,I got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! My only complaint is the lack of free games and demos. Love watching movies and all of the fitness apps and games though.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:31.704363,"I bought a Christmas gift for my son.
the gadget doesn't fit so had to return back.
THE COMPANY REFUSED TO TAKE BACK THE PRODUCT AND REFUSED ANY EXCHANGE OR REFUND AFTER 7 DAYS",1,1
2022-05-18 19:36:31.704363,"I love this device. you can avoid hitting objects surrounding you by creating/drawing a boundary with the controllers. creed is a work out, the games can be a tad bit expensive",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:31.704363,"Since i brought my oculus I've had the best time, games are pricey but worth evey penny and you can work out wothout leaving your home....best $300 investment i could ever make",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:31.704363,Awesome gaming opportunity and super fun. We started using these with adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities and they loved it. Fun for all ages and abilities.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:31.704363,Such a fun device it’s just unfortunate that I had to return it due to motion sickness. I attempted to slowly work my way into getting used to it but I could never get over it.,3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:31.704363,Perfect for workouts we’re currently snowed in and still getting it in with the oculus. I just hate that the headband is white. I like my thinks to stay looking clean and crisp,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:31.704363,Great VR! Our entire family loves this and the headset is really comfortable. We were hesitant to spend that much but it’s worth it. We have used it a lot and will continue to.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:32.407325,Absolutely love this thing. It's my first entry into VR and the price point is just right. Images are clear and crisp and watching moves on it is like being in an Imax theater.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:32.407325,Truly amazing! I am up there in age and I enjoy this more than anything I had as a kid. I even think it's great for my mother who has Alzheimer's. It keeps you active for sure.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:32.407325,"It needs to connect by your facebook account, at the first days I enjoyed to use it and I bought several games and …. But after a few days I didnt enjoy as the same days before",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:32.407325,Great fun!  I tried my grandson's oculus while I was at his house.  I bought one and now he calls me everyday to play.  Grandparents should definitely consider the investment.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:32.407325,Very fun to play. I have never used a VR before and this one is great. I read a lot of good reviews before purchasing the Oculus Quest 2. It is very immersive and fun to play.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:32.407325,"Love my quest, it’s amazing quality, runs things great, and is incredibly fun to use. I do have to say the display is a bit blurry but other then that it’s well worth the $300",5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:32.407325,"Can lag a bit... It being white, it's asking to get dirty... But overall a very affordable vr unit... Don't like the fact that you have to sign into Facebook inorder to use it",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:32.407325,Wow. We bought this for my son and have tried it out. Pretty awesome. Just watch and listen to your kids about predators and more. There is no parental filter on these things.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:32.860341,"Works well, lots of fun interacting with the virtual environment.  Software to wirelessly sync with computer is a little buggy, but that's not a knock on this unit. Very cool.",5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:33.313362,Great product and by far the best Virtual reality device available.  The head set does not fit children who are small though.  That’s the only reason I gave 4 as opposed to 5,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:33.313362,"The head strap is not the best but it works. Since I bought it, I use it occasionally on the weekends for a bit since the battery runs out quick. But overall my son loves it!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:33.313362,Grandson is enjoying his VR.  Not sure if he is rough on it but glad i paid extra for replacement if something goes wrong.  I have had to replace 2 times so far but worth it.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:33.313362,Im really glad i was able to finally buy this after some time. Its such a great buy. I especially love the fact i can cast my games in the tv so my family can see what i see.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:33.313362,First-time user in Virtual Reality.   The experience was beyond my expectations.  The headset appears solid and I have not had any issues since using buying it two weeks ago.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:33.313362,"It's a really great product. The images and motion are spectacular and it is very intuitive. Fun for all ages. 
I think they could include at least 1 full game for the price.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:33.313362,"If you want to get into VR without breaking the bank, this is the set to get.  The quality to price is the best IMO.  Solid comfortable build, responsive, and easy to set up.",5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:33.797623,"Pretty awesome, graphics are cool and immersive. There are issues with speed though. Slows and freezes when you aren't expecting it. A little frustrating, but not terrible.",4,4

2022-05-18 19:36:34.453719,Honestly not overly impressed with the oculus. The games are just not up to par. May be okay for 10 year olds but doesn’t quite suit the adult gameplay experience as well.,2,2
2022-05-18 19:36:34.453719,Daughter played this at her cousins house and loved to so much and added it to her Christmas list this year so the family can enjoy with her. Will be the favorite system..,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:34.891116,Unit had a bad display on arrival.  No help from support other than return to vendor or work with them for a replacement.  I advise not giving FB your money on this junk.,1,1

2022-05-18 19:36:35.344169,This thing is awesome. We bought 3 of them for the family to use from long distance. It’s so fun to be able to play with and almost really see people who are so far away.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:36.343902,overall super fun but it should come with a back thing to expand the thing because i bought one and what if it does not have a thing to rearange but overall 100000- 100,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:36.812542,Oculus quest 2 is awesome. the memory size is perfect. The strap had to get replaced immediately with the kiwi version. original strap gave me headaches. Now i love it,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:36.812542,Bought the Oculus for my kids as a Christmas present and they're pretty happy. We did have to buy multiple games separately so extra costs can build up pretty quickly.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:36.812542,This thing is so much fun. I bought it for my kids and had to try it out myself. The games will give you a workout without realizing it. Would definitely buy it again.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:37.265561,Fairly user friendly although I know I’ve barely skimmed the surface of what thing is capable of. Battery life kinda sucks but others than that the optics are amazing,4,4

2022-05-18 19:36:37.265561,"I bought this for my sons birthday gift but, we all get to enjoy it.  I like the fact that is wireless.  I must say it does get you a little motion sickness at first.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:37.265561,The Oculus ad that I saw said there was great interactive corn on here. That was incorrect. I can’t even find cornography on Oculus. There are some cool games though.,3,3

2022-05-18 19:36:37.265561,Wow this is a lot of fun. I believe as games continue to get added that utilize the full function of the Oculus Quest 2 the better it will be. Beat saber is a blast!!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:37.265561,I am having so much fun with my oculus! It is a bit pricey but worth the exercise! I play with my kids and that’s great we do this together. Fun for the whole family!,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:37.734200,My kids love this. We’ll need to get some accessories including a different head strap that is easier to adjust.  That’s the only negative thing.   It’s so much fun!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:37.734200,"Pretty convenient VR set: no cables, easy setup, fits well enough (unless you're wearing glasses). My biggest complaint is that it doesn't stream to TVs very easily.",4,4

2022-05-18 19:36:38.749588,"The Quest 2 is simply not as good as the first one.  It is more portable yes, but relies on a phone type processor so can only play lesser games.  Still fun though!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:38.749588,I love this virtual reality game the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is the battery seems to die pretty fast but it also charges fast so it’s not really a bother,4,4

2022-05-18 19:36:39.671247,"This is something I’ve always wanted to try and I’m glad I did ! Simply put , this thing is Amazing ! A easy to use all in one VR set . Oculus (or Meta) has done a wonderful job making a quality product and a pretty impressive experience. It seems to have something for everyone. The controls are pretty intuitive and seem to track well for all the games I’ve played thus far. Battery life is ok as is the comfort of the included head strap . It is definitely worth upgrading to the better strap with built in battery, this is a must . I personally experienced some degree of dizziness but it quickly passed. Something to note ; the Oculus store has a policy on most of the games it sells , if you experience motion sickness and have played the game for less than 2 hours, you can get a refund! One more thing, as of this time, you must have a Facebook account to use this . It’s not a big deal as you can change  All of your privacy settings so whatever you do on Oculus is not all over Facebook. I have no regrets about this purchase, it’s been pretty amazing so far and look forward to what’s ahead for VR . The whole family loves it !",5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:40.592906,Fun gaming experience! Charging cable is very short and it’s awkward enough that you’ll want a case for when it’s not in use but game play experience is awesome!,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:40.592906,Did not work as well as I expected.  The focus was not as expected as well.  Any movement off the center of the eye piece caused the device to come out of focus.,3,3

2022-05-18 19:36:41.014683,Could be more realistic. Games could be a better price. Headset battery could last longer. Shouldnt have to pay more for the battery to last longer then 2 hours.,4,4

2022-05-18 19:36:41.498944,"Two kids enjoy it very much.

2022-05-18 19:36:41.951963,I loved it when it worked but day one after my first time using it it over heated and wouldn’t allow it to charge just by plugging it in… less than 3 hours in.,2,2
2022-05-18 19:36:41.951963,"Pretty fantastic, Only problem is with the system itself. Kinda glitchy and make sure your careful because the games are not compatible with other Br headsets!",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:41.951963,"My kids really enjoy it.  Definitely find enough space to play so arm movements don't hit any surrounding furniture.  Easy set up, requires a Facebook account.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:41.951963,Better than expected however still not on the tier as PlayStation and Xbox. Games still lacks major productivity and storytelling. Still fun to pass some time.,3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:41.951963,"My wife loves her Oculus. She has found lots if games. The VR experience is amazing. Watching someone play is fun, but nothing compares to playing it yourself.",5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:42.420603,It is so cool.  It is like being in a different world.  So much potential.  I wear glasses with it but it took awhile to figure out the best head set position.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:42.420603,My son loves his Oculus Quest 2. He says the headset is comfortable and fits better in his face than the original quest. Great purchase for a reasonable price.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:42.420603,It keeps breaking. Had it only 10 months and have had to replace it twice. Thankfully oculus is replacing it but it takes weeks sometimes to get a replacement.,3,3

2022-05-18 19:36:42.420603,"Love this system, everything about it is awesome, does hurt after wearing long time on head, recommended another pair of head straps or leave it a little loose",5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:42.420603,All I can say is that the metaverse is real.  Its very fun and there's tons of things to do.  If you want to experience VR this is the best bang for your buck.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:42.889244,"Works as expected, selection of VR games on the headset alone is slime it would be worth it to pick up a data cable to plug it into your pc to play steam games",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:42.889244,I really like it I’ve haven’t had it that long and I’m in love with it still it is super amazing that you can put that on and jump into a whole new reality!,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:42.889244,This is the gift my grandson wanted for his birthday  and one last grandson wants one for Christmas.   It take time understanding how to work the game system.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:42.889244,This headset is great and very fun to use. It’s very easy to set up. The only complaint I have is the battery life because it dies after about 2 hours of use.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:42.889244,Absolutely love it. My kid loves it too. She loves riding the roller coaster. The headset is comfortable and there is a wide variety of games and experiences.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:42.889244,So much fun with friends.  Typically an xbox guy and didnt know how much i or the family wpuld enjoy this thing but it is amazing.  Recommend bowling and golf,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:42.889244,"Purchased this so our son could do a baseball training app.  I struggled to give it 4 stars and not 3.  First, its dependent upon Facebook to operate.   Facebook went down and the headset wouldn't work.  It seems like they would have this operating separately and not dependent on it.  Also the headset has been glitchy since the crash that happened at Facebook. The battery life on it isn't the greatest but fortunately you can attach an external pack.  Laat but not least is the app store.  I browse through it and I feel as if i dont see all of the games.  I typed a few in search to find but i didnt see those games when I went to Browse All.

Now you're wondering why 4 stars then.  Well it's because its still pretty neat.  My son can train and take BP in the garage whenever he wants.  Although there seems to be a lack of blockbuster games so far, there are still some cool games in the store.  Also you can expand the library by using as PCVR.  I like to tinker so you can modify the headset to how you like it.  So far we've added a halo headstrap but will do a battery pack and RX lenses in it.  So for $299 its a pretty cool item.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:42.889244,"Wow. As a VR first timer, I was shocked. It's so real. The experience is extraordinary. The controllers are a little slippery for some games like table tenis.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:42.889244,"Is a good produc but when I started to play my head hurt, I even felt dizzy and even started to sweat , i don't know the reason thats why i return the product",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:43.404747,"Surprise Xmas present for my 20 year old sons, they loved it! Trying to pull them away from the Xbox and pS5, it worked! Awesome experience, super fun games!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:43.404747,"This was my first experience with VR, I play it wirelessly with my PC running the game and it's awesome! Be careful of your surroundings when playing though!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:43.404747,"It is a fun set to use, but spend $60 extra and get warranty, because the thing sometimes turns off whenever it wants, and who knows, maybe you will drop it.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:43.404747,This was a great buy especially with the new update and larger storage size.  If you used the PS4 VR you will not regret getting this.  Better games as well.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:43.404747,I received a Quest 2 as a gift and i thought it would be a gimmick. Holy cow! It's so much more than just a gaming device. Great fun for watching movies too.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:43.404747,Love the oculus 2!  I started playing poker yesterday (for free) and it's crazy how it actually feels like you are playing with real people at a poker table.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:43.842146,"Heavy on the face even with the headstrap (sold separately) the system is still too new to have a good selection of games, but some of them are still great!",4,4

Also this game should be Able to purchase games for it join",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:43.842146,"I bought this for my grandson for Christmas. He wanted the Rift, but it was discontinued. He doesn't know he's getting this. So I hope he will be surprised!",5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:44.966884,It’s pretty cool and fun. I just don’t like how the battery drains so quick. And the screen sometimes will glitch. Might be just this one that is defected.,4,4

2022-05-18 19:36:52.152505,Such a great VR headset. Don't need to plug it into a PC. So many great games to choose from the Oculus store. Continuously gets monthly updates.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:52.152505,"Love, love, love it. Battery drains pretty quick depending on the game. But, I love the workouts and the effects. Very realistic!!! I bought two.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:52.152505,amazing product for the price. Can connect it to your PC without even having a cable and that alone sold me. Works great exactly how I imagined!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:52.152505,Works well and I’m loving this VR. It is really easy to use. However the setup take a bit of time but once you done it is very simple to use it.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:52.152505,Dope product with some great games and  services within the headset. Got it to learn more about the meta verse and so far it’s very informative.,4,4

2022-05-18 19:36:52.152505,"The smile on his face was worth it all! Great buy, reasonable price and awesome system. Purchased for my finance on Christmas. Highly recommend.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:52.152505,It was a good product but it hurt my eyes It wasn't worth keeping it for me maybe other people would be OK and and it would not hurt their eyes.,4,4

2022-05-18 19:36:52.621146,VR has come a long way.  When you put the headset on you are instantly in another realm.  The movements are accurate and the graphics are great.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:52.621146,I use this headset stand-alone since I don’t have a PC. This is by far a much better experience than the PSVR especially since there’s no wires!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:52.621146,Got one for myself and my wife.  So far they're pretty awesome but make sure your parents are sitting down if you decide to let them try it out.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:52.621146,Very nice game system. I recommend the battery strap pack to go with this. Long lasting game play and it feels comfortable with the battery pack,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:53.074165,I love it it’s a great way to get exercise in if you don’t have the time to go to a gym. I’m still going threw the headset but so far I love it,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:53.074165,"Good product What I expected. fun to use. Connection chord that comes with unit is not long enough

 Had to purchase extra long extension chord",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:53.074165,My son favorite thing to use. He also has PlayStation VR but the fact that you don’t have to stand in front of the television puts this on top.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:53.074165,Overall my family really likes this device.  It is a bit awkward to get a clear picture which I don't love but the interaction is a lot of fun.,4,4

2022-05-18 19:36:53.542805,A brunch lf fun for my 9 year old son. He has both psvr and oculus quest 2. He enjoys the oculus more because he is not connected to a console,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:53.542805,"One of the best tech purchases I've ever made. So much fun. Highly recommend everyone at least ""tries"" VR. It'll blow you away the first time.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:53.542805,It’s very cool technology speaking lots of interesting things to do and see.. I wish I had more parental control.. i like the casting feature.,3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:53.542805,"Kids really wanted it so we got it. They played it for a couple days and now rarely use it. Like a pool, “Better when your friend paid for it”",2,2
2022-05-18 19:36:53.542805,Perfect Christmas gift for my kids. Bonus $50 used to purchase games. Only drawback in my opinion is that you have to have a Facebook account.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:53.542805,Fun for my 12 year old but since you need a Facebook account to use these and kids under 13 can’t be on Facebook creates a bit of a problem!!!,3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:53.542805,"I got it as a Christmas gift for grandson, he is 10 years old. He absolutely loves it. The games are a little pricey but overall a great gift.",4,4

2022-05-18 19:36:54.011444,"I had a wonderful time using this product.  It provides hours of entertainment and joy.
I liked the opportunity to play poker and other games.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:54.011444,"Really a fun console, specially during these time. I would definitely suggest getting the geek squad warranty with all the swinging and moving",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:54.011444,Perfect exept you will get a headache every 25 mins about but other then that and the games cost 20-30 dollars its perfect so if u get it good,4,4

2022-05-18 19:36:54.011444,This is a very cool game that actually allows you to feel like you’re right there in the scene. Even get roller coaster sickness from the ride,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:54.011444,Great gaming console!  My son is 12 and loves it. It’s a little difficult to set up but we figured it out!! Love it! Keeps him very occupied.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:54.464463,This is the number one! I owned 3 VR devices before but no one close to Oculus 2. Perfect purchase if you don't care about Facebook exposure.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:54.464463,So much more fun than I was expecting. I have poor eyesight but I was still able to see clearly (which was my main concern). My kids love it!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:54.464463,I’ve never played a game in my life . And was nervous to buy this . But so far I love it. I bought a few games and will continue to buy more.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:54.464463,"once again the oculus 2 does not disappoint.  After buying one for my son, my daughter loved playing too.  Now they have endless hours of fun",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:54.464463,"Let me tell you… this is a new type of experience of gaming. It is beyond crazy. Please, to all the gamers out there. It’s so crazy amazing !",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:54.464463,It's really amazing sadly you do need extra batteries or a battery charger because you can't charge the controllers but all in all really fun,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:54.464463,We purchased this to entertain our 92 year old father.  He loves it!  He likes to fish so there were a lot of underwater places he could see.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:55.115783,Really fun for all the family. Just wish battery would last longer. But other than that everyone that has tried it says they need to get one.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:55.115783,I wish the screen was a bit better but for the price this is the best way to prepare for the coming metaverse or to play hours of beat saber.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:55.115783,It's only been since Christmas and the one controller is already not working!! It stopped working and of course the kid is very upset over it,3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:55.115783,"Headset is OK, There are some are ways to adjust the headset, however it doesn't work well for everyone. Battery life is not the best either.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:55.115783,"The Quest 2 is the best Vr system out there. It has lots of accessories and games and apps to play with.
We love the parental controls on it.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:55.115783,Got this for my sons up coming Christmas present. Best Buy sent me a notice and it was at a price I couldn’t refuse. Fast shipping as always.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:55.115783,It's ok overall I feel like more games could be added and there could also be better graphics I feel if they tried harder it could be better.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:55.615636,"Got it as a Birthday gift for a friend. Great for being portable VR with no computer tower, laptop or console needed. Game selection is good.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:55.615636,Its definitely a change in technology since the first oculus I go days without touching it and then days where i dont want to put it downs.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:55.615636,"This VR is awesome and so real, i love the graphics and sound. I can also stream to my phone and record what I'm playing. Best way to game!!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:55.615636,"Overall enjoyable experience, and good for the price. Only fault is the strap support, but as long as you don’t play for too long it’s fine.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:55.615636,One of my best purchased. Family and friends having lots of fun. Also works well as a daily workout. Very satisfied with this VR experience.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:55.615636,"So amazing. I am so happy I got it and made an impulse buy. If you’re even thinking about buying an Oculus, quit reading reviews and buy it!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:55.615636,"Love it, great for getting more movement. Can use it almost anywhere. Family fun. Particularly love saber beats which was an extra purchase.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:55.615636,We bought thinking we could use this with PS4 however this is an independent VR system.  All games are like aps you purchase through headset,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:55.615636,Love the new technology.  Still has a ways to go in terms of video quality and battery life.  Will get motion sickness if you play too long.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:56.084277,Being able to have a wireless vr headset is awesome especially coming from psvr and if you got a highend pc with great wifi its even better.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:56.084277,"Works very well,  easy to set up and learn.  Very fun games! Not good for people who get dizzy easily or have problems with motion sickness.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:56.084277,"Had the rift, kind of a pain to set up. Got this for my daughter for Christmas, it is so much more convenient to set up and play right away.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:56.084277,The Oculus 2 is a big advancement from the initial product release.  The graphics are good.  I would recommend the purchase of this product.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:56.084277,Great purchase. My only recommendation is for the battery life to improve. Two hours of battery life seems low for such an expensive device.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:56.084277,My son loves doing 3D modeling with these and playing 3D games.  Make sure you get a case to put them in as well to protect your investment.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:56.084277,Such a fun device to be able to bring on the go! Just having the chance to play freely without the need of a pc defeats every other headset!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:56.084277,Excellent VR! Had one of the 1st ones that came out and this is 100 times better. Purchased as a Christmas gift and was definitely worth it!,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:56.521674,"Great for gaming and chill 
Does have a moderate battery life but enough to let you game for awhile . Great buy for people who like to game",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:56.521674,"simply amazing. not only have i fully enjoyed it, my wife who hates everything technical and game related just made buy her one of her own.",5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:56.521674,I tried my friends Oculus & I had to have one for myself I love this thing so I bought one for my family we all enjoy the Oculus very much,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:56.521674,I just had to get one from hearing and seeing everyone having fun its still pretty new to me and in not a gamer but i am enjoying it alot!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:56.990315,Love this new model since you get kore memory for the same price. The oculus is an amazing product and is a great way to get a workout in!,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:56.990315,Meh. Can’t get the oculus to connect to the pc. Tried everything but no joy. Will end up collecting dust if the problem can’t be resolved.,2,2
2022-05-18 19:36:56.990315,My husband and I picked this up for his parents. My mother-in-law absolutely loves it. It was easy to set up and shr says its easy to use.,5,5

2022-05-18 19:36:56.990315,Its was a little pricey but very entertaining not realizing that we have the Playstation 5 we really wouldn't use it enough for the money.,3,3
2022-05-18 19:36:56.990315,Great product the oculus is probably one of the best purchase I’ve ever made for only 299 the things you can do with the Oculus is amazing,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:56.990315,Super cool VR rig. My wife absolutely loves the beat saber. Only flaw is that the Chromecast streaming has a fairly significant audio lag.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:57.443334,My children love it and it has awesome graphics.  It also a great activity for them for they are always sweating with the games they play.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:57.443334,I have a couple VR headsets. This is the easiest to use. No mounting motion sensors and no big heavy cords. Just put the headset on and go,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:57.443334,"My son loves his Christmas gift. The headsets are pretty amazing technology. But the video is a bit blurred, especially towards the sides.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:57.443334,"Good upgrade, feels amazing compared to Quest 1. FB making us have accounts isnt the way VR should go, but for a budget its okay i guess.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:57.443334,Worked great for the first week or so. Then out of No where it will No turn on. It just goes to a gray screen. We will be returning ASAP.,1,1
2022-05-18 19:36:57.443334,This was a gift for my daughter - she loves it. In fact her sister bought one and now her brother in law wants one. A lot of fun for them,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:57.443334,This is a great product at a great price.  The only negative thing to say is that you have to have a Facebook account in order to use it.,4,4
2022-05-18 19:36:57.443334,Great quality VR for a reasonable price.  Lots of available options.  Do not like the FaceBook requirement.  Be mindful if kids will use.,5,5
2022-05-18 19:36:57.443334,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. Worth the price!!!
She cancelled her gym membership for now, and loves the workouts on here.",4,4

Delivery was as promised no issues with packaging or how quick the item was received.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:37:04.987505,"The Oculus Quest 2, is as basic as any Virtual Reality ( VR) Headset could be, while it does offer advanced features not offered by most off brand headsets, these features, show little promise in anything that isn’t on its main menu.

Hand Tracking- For apps that people would want hand tracking to be used for, is not available on. Hand Tracking is slow, and movement is very off time if you move your hands quickly as the outside cameras fail to properly catch your movement.

AirLink- Mediocre at best? It offers a very interactive and open system to which you’re freely available to play offline listed games which refers to games on different platforms, an example being steam. 
Offers an unstable fps, and most games completely crash even when the pc being used is more than capable of running the specific games, this evidence was provided by steams VR Performance Test.


Fit: Decent fit, if you’re working out make sure you tighten it or else it will fly off your head, it is very bouncy and hard to tighten at that.


Battery; Battery is very sensitive, if you don’t immediately remove the battery after it reaches 100% you run the risk of damaging your battery.",4,4

2022-05-18 19:40:17.621074,"After reading so many FB comments *I barely go on FB* I convinced myself I would never be able to figure out how to get it to work when it arrives. Doom, Gloom and a lot of Zoom - if I couldn't figure this out by myself I was out a lot of money! By the way, has anyone else notice the huge price comarison of the Quest? Anywhere from $299 - $699 for the same Oculus Quest 2? Anyway, jus sayin...

Today - It finally arrived and boy was I terrified opening the box. I stared, should I send it back - can I do this... well, a long time later I did it, I tore the plastic and out came my Oculus Quest 2 with two cool controllers.

Within 15 minutes I was hooked up to WiFi, FB and playing tennis. I got tired and did meditation for 10 minutes just floating in space. The realty is - its plain awesome! It looked so real that I found myself suddenly afraid of heights! Then it was time to charge the quest - which took around 2 hours.

Yes, it was that easy!!! I love it! So, lesson to everyone - if I can do it all by MYSELF you can too - because you are awesome! Especially if you reading my review. Thanks!

A quick note: You have the option to move the eye piece to make you vision clearer. The eye piece does not rotate. You must take your thumbs and slide right or left.",5,5

2022-05-18 19:40:19.500414,"This thing is WAY too cool!! Very easy to set up, very intuitive process. My 13yr old son set it up, I just had to link it to my Facebook account, then we were done. You have to download games. There are MANY to choose from depending upon your tastes - first person shooter games, fitness type games, etc. The graphics are incredible, with VERY realistic 3-D VR imaging. I'm not a big fan of heights and this thing tricks me into thinking I am at heights. It can be downright frightening, that is how realistic it can be! The audio / sound is top notch, whether playing music or whatever during the games. It is truly a very immersive experience. We only have one in our house and that is going to change since me and my two boys are always scrambling to play it. If you are into gaming or know someone who is, this is a must have item.

Warning - this is very realistic. If you get car sick, motion sick, suffer bouts of vertigo, and or have inner ear or other balance/stability issues - this will definitely trigger those. The depth and motion clarity it combines in its 3D VR graphics are absolutely amazing. It makes you feel like you are physically there, hence the meaning behind VR. I don't like heights too much and I got light headed with cold sweats during one game where we were riding high altitude coasters.",5,5

As a matter of fact, the first game I played was the Darth Vader (Star Wars) one and I was completely blown away with just how realistic and immersive it was.  (Although, the game was rather short.  Part 1 took me maybe an hour to complete.  Not a criticism of the Oculus, obviously, but be aware that gaming experiences are not always like those on a traditional gaming console or computer regarding the ""depth"" or length of the experience.)  The controls are intuitive, for the most part (and there is a tutorial included within the unit that you can go through help become acquainted with the unit).  The focus does not always appear to be perfect when looking around, but overall that is a minor annoyance that does not detract from the experience.  The unit is also comfortable for the most part, but after gaming for a while you do notice the weight and the ""pressing"" of the unit against your face.  Along those lines, the ""seal"" around the unit may not necessarily fit every size face perfectly.  Toward the bottom, around the nose, I do get a little light bleeding in.  Lastly, I tried the International Space Station simulation and it did make me a little woozy (I did not have that issue with the Darth Vader game).  The experience is very realistic, but motion sickness can be a very real side effect with some games.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:40:19.500414,"Gamer since the Nintendo and Sega days. Currently on the Xbox Series X.  My VR experience has always been at Dave and Busters or Main Event. Few at the mall. Used those goggles with your phone too. I thought VR was trash, dull and polygonal. 

Got this thing and wow. NO HYPE this thing has bright and colorful graphics. I've played SKYRIM, SYNTH RIDERS, WALKING DEAD, AND PAVLOV and I get immersed and lose track of my surrounding. 

*Helpful tip* Battery life depends on graphics and game. Average about 2 hours. Buy a 6' cord (USB-A to USB-C), and a slim battery power bank that fits in a back pocket. You now turned 2 hours of gameplay to 4 hours or more depending on your battery bank. Can be done as little as $20-30. I use a 4kmah battery. Gives me 2 hours of gameplay.

This thing is so cool. VR is about to take over. Especially at this price range. I love that you can connect to your PC and play PC VR games wirelessly with AIR LINK at no extra cost! I read before you had to buy an app.  If you want to entertain, connect to AIR LINK with your PC, hook up your TV HDMI to PC and entertain your friends and family watching you play or explore. 

What I dont like is that there's a small SWEET SPOT in the goggles. If you're not in it, then it gets blurry. Wish the sweet spot was bigger I guess. Have to adjust every now and then back in it. 

If you're going to cry about having to sign up with Facebook. Make a new profile just for gaming. Duh!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:40:19.516036,"This is the best standalone headset on the market right now (jan 2022. The resolution is one of the highest on the market right now, and with the experimental 120hz refresh rate, the visual quality is very good. The controllers are alright, however the thumb tracking could use some work, and without using a controller cover, they are an absolute sweat and grease magnet. The headset can also be linked to your pc with a link cable, although I would not recommend the official oculus cable; it is overpriced and is not a noticeable enough improvement to be worth it for me. Pcvr works great, however the battery can still drain while using it, unless you have enough power going to your usb port, and if you don't have a usb 3.0 or 3.1 cable, battery while in pcvr might be an issue. 

The headset does have a few downsides, like the uncomfortable strap that it comes with out of the box. If you plan to play for more than an hour or two, I would definitely upgrade. The facial interface is also not the best, because it absorbs sweat like a sponge. The included silicone cover works okay, but I would definitely recommend upgrading. One of the biggest drawbacks of the Quest 2 is that there are only three IPD (Inter-pupillary distance) settings. If your IPD is one of these settings (58mm, 63mm, or 68mm), than this won't be an issue for you. If your eyes don't fall at or near one of these settings, you might have some issues with clarity. 

Overall, this is a very good headset for the price, and definitely recommended.",4,4
2022-05-18 19:40:19.516036,"I guess if you use it as a complement device to your PC to get a VR experience in games you play than it might be worth it. But as a standalone product (as FB currently actively advertises it) it is mostly a geek toy. My kids had some fun initially, first few days, with Beat Saber, RecRoom, some other games, but they became bored very fast and quickly went back to Roblox and other games on their laptops. Yes, it is fun for friends gatherings as entertainment, but since you can't play together and you need a lot of space, it is not ideal. The traditional console is much better. My sound had a birthday recently. We had an Xbox Series S and this Oculus, and although every kid on the party tried Oculus once or twice, and one (5yo) kid really liked it, most quickly switched to XBox. Oculus does have a novelty factor, but the selection of games is very poor. Some videos are cool, like the one narrated by David Attenborough, but in general - not there yet. And apps/games are so outrageously expensive. Doing physical exercises app has a subscription of $19 per month! Not one-time payment, but MONTHLY subscription. Maybe it is fun to try it, but exercising with big something on your head isn't such a great experience, and I don't many will continue to do it after a couple of extensive sessions. Apple Fitness plus provide much more for less money, and better integration with other Apple devices, including AW.  
So yeah, you can spend $299 on Oculus, but expect it to spend most of the time on your self or in the closet",3,3
2022-05-18 19:40:19.516036,"I love my Oculus Quest 2 Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset - 128GB.  I can play games in the Oculus store as well as games from SteamVR on the PC.  I'm coming from the Samsung Gear VR, so this is an upgrade.  

There are lots of reasons to commend it. First, the price point is accessible. Second, the availability of games is plentiful and growing. Third, the accessories you can purchase to make your experience more personalized are vast, and many are reasonably priced.  Finally, the headset is rich with features to make socializing fun, like casting to the Oculus app on the phone or to your PC.

Please don't think you must have the 256 GB version to have room for the games you play.  Some experiences will be once in a blue moon experiences, and there will be no need to keep them on your headset.  They can be downloaded on demand when you get a taste for the app again.  More frequently played apps can easily be hosted on your headset with room to spare for many folks.

The one con, and it's a major one for me, is that you must have a Facebook account to use the Oculus headset.  One of the reasons this is a problem was made evident when Facebook and its holdings went dark recently.  Nobody could access Oculus.

A word of advice for folks new to VR, use your hand straps on your controller.  If you don't, I promise you that you will drop or throw your controllers at some point.  Been there.  Don't that.  Let's hope you don't send your controller flying through something like your TV or your friend's eyeglasses.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:40:19.516036,"I  put off getting a VR headset for a long time because I didn't think it would be worth the price. 

Got it on special. 

It is one of the greatest experiences with technology you can have! It does an amazing job at completely immersing you into environment you are viewing. 

There are several apps that are free to use on it, but be prepared to dish out hundreds of dollars for a better experience. 

I would have given it 5 stars, but here are the cons that made me lower my rating:

This is owned by Facebook. A multi-billion dollar company. You would expect nothing but the best. Yet there are several re-occurring glitches.

1. Sometimes, it randomly gives an error that ""tracking"" has stopped working and it won't let you do anything. You would have to restart to get it working again.
2. Once in a while, you'll get an error: Oculus Assistant stopped working. Again you have to restart and hopefully that resolves it.
3. Sometimes its hard to indicate what the ""floor"" is. You can press reset, but it still wont detect the floor properly. It should be easier to do this.
4. You don't have absolute freedom in choosing what position you need to be in when wearing the headset. Eg. You can't always just lay down and see everything properly. It depends on the app if they allow it. Sometimes, you want to watch something in 360 while laying down.
5. Should have a quick button that activates the cameras so you can pause your interaction and view your surroundings quickly. I hate having to remove the headset to quickly see something around me.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:40:20.387399,"I've played on other VR headsets before but I never purchased one myself because I never felt they were quite there yet. When I heard this one was not only standalone, but could be used on the PC, was 120hz, is completely wireless and only 300 dollars I couldn't believe that all the complaints I had had been addressed. Another big selling point for Oculus vs the Vive is having access to both the Oculus store and Steam available to play games on PC.

The two main things I had worried about when comparing online, resolution and tracking accuracy, have not been an issue at all. Could the resolution be better? Absolutely, but it is more than good enough to fully enjoy any title you play. The accuracy, however, is a different story. I've only had very slight issues with the tracking and it hasn't once affected gameplay. In fact, I am incredibly impressed with how well the controller and floor is tracked. It's very apparent when you're playing shooter type games where aiming matters a lot.

The main complaint I have is the Air Link feature to wirelessly connect to the PC did have issues at first. My desktop is in a different room than the router and connected wirelessly over AX. The signal is more than good enough for gaming, but I guess it just couldn't quite cut it when it came to streaming VR wirelessly. I ran an ethernet to the living room where the router is and it works near flawlessly now. I can even play the Oculus in other rooms (including where my PC is) and there's no issues either. It might just be something not quite optimized yet since Air Link is still in the beta phase right now.

Overall I really couldn't be happier. My wife and I had talked about getting a VR headset for years but never could quite pull the trigger, but for 300 dollars getting this as our first full VR headset was a no brainer. Love it!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:40:20.387399,"First off, if you're considering waiting for a newer headset for the first time, just send it on this if it's going to be your first VR experience. The Quest 3 is still probably a year away, and getting the Quest 2 now is much more fun. Facebokk has millions of users on the Quest 2 so you know it'll be around and keep receiving updates for a long time. ONLY bad news that everyone knows is it does require a Facebook account (meaning the user account needs a signup age of 13+), but I don't mind that personally for this experience! I suggest playing for 15-30 minutes maximum for your first experience, so use the First Steps app to get used to it. (Even though I used it for the first 2 hours as my first time amd haven't got sick. Maybe using the Gear VR first helped with that). Comfort isn't bad if you use the new silicone cover and use the TOP STRAP to support your head mainly, but I highly recommend a new strap (the official Elite Strap is known for snapping so use a 3rd party) and facial interface (best from VRCover). If you want PCVR a cable can do while starting but wireless is where it's at. 
Wireless is a feature best for use under the conditions following:
At least a Wi-Fi6 router solely connected to your Quest wirelessly and PC with ethernet. (Around $80 for the router)
Potentially a power bank at the back if your strap for added playtime as the Quest 2 only has a 2 hour battery life (the power bank will add support to thr headset making it feel less front heavy, and will have less issues with battery degradation).
A new strap is recommended for longer play sessions, and a VRCover facial interface too.
The Oculus Rift app is required on your desktop for PCVR. 
SteamVR is your best bet for PCVR games. Although you have to use the Oculus Rift app in combination with SteamVR.

Lastly, take your time getting into VR (I know it is really, really fun!). You'll probably enjoy yourself more if you take your time and explore all the opportunities. Play how you want and enjoy!
Happy Questing!",5,5
2022-05-18 19:40:20.387399,"Hands down one of the best purchases of 2020 for me was the Oculus Quest 2.  I bought a 256GB for myself, and recently this refreshed 128GB model for a friend.  The display, quality, and longevity have been top notch.  There are some rough patches on the journey, but overall the Oculus Quest 2 is how VR should be.

Overall the physical design is surprisingly light.  It's only slightly heavier than my first generation WMR headset.  Tracking is lightyears better than the Windows headset, and the display/resolution is just as good.  Optics are quite good for the price - this still represents a lower end headset, but most people will be impressed.  The Oculus is still immersive, but not in the same way as say the Index or other wide field of vision headset.

Controllers are smaller than what I was used to, but they're durable and easy to use for even smaller hands.  Triggers are responsive and easy to use, and the Oculus button allows you to re-center yourself easily.  Great usability because of that.

The wire free nature of the Oculus is one of the biggest selling features, and I can attest - after coming off of a WMR headset - that wire free is the way to go for most games.  It's just plain more immersive, and being able to swing away during beat saber is a million times better than worrying about a wire.  First party and exclusive games are ok, but the experience is great.

Oculus keeps updating the software, and features, flexibility, and battery life all seem to benefit.  I've been using the Quest 2 for over 9 months now, and I can attest to the software maturing and benefiting the user experience.  The ability to cast, and record is fun.

The included band is cheap and not very comfortable. The pro band lasted me like 2 months before breaking (I have a large head, and my kids small heads, so a lot of adjusting seems to have killed it).  Third party bands pretty much do the same thing, so I've resigned to replacing them every few months after they crack and break. 

Overall this is a great time.  Software isn't the cheapest, and this is not $4000 gaming PC, but overall the experience is top notch.  This is worth your time and money if you enjoy the game selection.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:40:20.402988,"By far the best value in VR today, hands down. The fact that it works both standalone and tethered with a PC really makes it the best of both worlds...

Unfortunately I don't have a lot of good to say about VR in general.

Issues specific to this device design:
* It lacks focal adjustment, and the virtual focal distance is far enough away as to require corrective lenses for us near-sighted while using...
* Unless you have a tiny head with thin frames, your glasses will not fit - with or without the extension.
* Using without glasses isn't terrible, but not great
* Peripheral vision is blurry even with the lens separation properly adjusted.
* The head strap is also intended for people with tiny heads, and it doesn't do a very good job keeping the headset aligned with your eyes
* Head tracking performance degrades quickly if conditions are less than ideal (lower lighting, room isn't super clean)
* Playing VR is not and cannot be a social activity. It is inherently isolating, and not safe to use around other people unless you can trust them implicitly. The temptation to mess with a blindfolded person is too pervasive.

The Oculus Software / experience:
* Does not work well at all your feet aren't on the ground (recliner, bed for example)
* Basic accessibility features are lacking - what if your legs are paralyzed? What if you have balance issues and cannot stand with your eyes covered? What if you are missing an arm? What if you have tremors / neuropathy? Good luck typing lol
* You must show it where the floor is, and if you are seated your head hight will be wrong. An experimental option bumps up your head height... But there really needs to be a more basic ""I cannot stand up with this thing on because of a disability""
* You cannot reset your view with respect to the ground. If you are in a reclined position it is nearly impossible to look at or reach thing on the ground.
* The only option for left-handed folks moves the oculus button, but the switch isn't honored by all apps
* Games are WAY too expensive. Don't believe the hype - VR isn't significantly harder to develop for that any other 3D. The excessive pricing is because of the ""rich nerd"" assumption and greed. Prices NEED to come down if they want people to embrace VR. VR doesn't stand up to marathon gaming - these games are going to be mostly on the casual / small bites side of things.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:40:20.402988,"The headset is way to uncomfortable to wear longer then 2 hours
Been playing consistently for over 2 weeks and still get motion sickness fairly easily so at best I'm getting 2 hour gaming sessions before either the blood in my face is squeezed out and it feels bruised on my cheeks and forehead.
There are solutions to this but they're mostly third party.
On top of all this, everything has to be rebuilt instead of just transferred like a phone would be.
Instead of having the same apps as your phone, those same apps need to be rebuilt from the ground up, which means not only is there next to zero useful apps, but the ones you can find are entirely different from what they actually are on android or pc.
Instead of having one epic system, we have three slightly infinitely broken systems that can never be completed until they agree to be one system.

Be willing to jump through a lot of hoops to get things like basic android apps working and getting screen sharing with you computer working easily without some  serious modifications and know how.
2022 will hopefully changed this, but based on how the economy has been playing this out, I'd say they're going to take 10 years just to get N64 working again instead of just running android with the android store.

Aside from all this, its essentially the same game over and over rebranded and reskinned.
Either shooting games, tag games, or table tennis like games.

Some good experiences to be had, but not enough yet to make it worth a full fledge console price when you'll have to stretch to get 200 hours out of this thing when you can accidently dump that amount of time into a computer or game console without even realizing this.

Where as the Oculus will cause you a great deal of pain, discomfort, and anger over how annoying it is to use this headset as a virtual desktop

From the moment you turn it on you'll start having thoughts like:
Why isn't this done yet? Why can't I find this app? why doesn't this basic app that's over 15years old work properly? 
Why can I stream fast past games to kids around the world where we can real time shoot each other with guns, but I have to pay 150$ yearly subscription just to stream my screen to my headset? 

Why is it such a crap experience when streaming 3 feet to my headset?
I've been playing real time COD since I was 13 years old over wifi, yet some how, some way, it takes to much information to have real time updates with a computer 3 feet infront of me.",3,3
2022-05-18 19:40:20.402988,"The Oculus Quest 2 is a neat glimpse into the future bogged down by a plethora of issues. Privacy concerns withstanding - as Meta is aiming to monitor every movement and facial expression one makes whilst using the device - there are many practical problems with the design of the device itself. It only has 3 different IPD settings, meaning that anyone whose IPD falls in between or outside of the presets will have an issue with blurring vision and an unclear image. This was a huge part of what I disliked about my experience with it, as it gave me significant headaches and visual distortion well after stopping use of the device. For clarity's sake, I used it for about 30 minutes at a time, once a day for a few days in a row.  Many people tend to complain about feeling motion sickness when using these devices and while I did feel a little goopy in the gut, I didn't enjoy the sensation of motion enough to get to where this was a serious issue for me. I grew up playing video games regularly and still do occasionally, so it was entertaining to see how I could interact with games in a 3D space. That being said, none of the games felt very satisfying, and these days if I want to play a video game I certainly don't want to be strapped into an uncomfortable near-eye projector to be fully engaged in the experience. The headstrap is a well-documented nightmare and it's absurd that they charge extra for a higher-quality one instead of changing out the one included. They finally added a silicone cover to the padding around the eyes after countless complaints about the foam irritating people's skin, and I'm not surprised as it feels kind of like fine sandpaper to the touch. What would have been the most relaxing experiences were dulled by low-resolution image quality (on a high-speed connection, no less) and in the case of multiplayer games, a disturbing amount of young players - well below the recommended age for using the device in the first place. It's a shame that parents don't monitor their kids better to prevent this from happening and instead slap them into a device that will invariably detriment their developing sense of balance and spatial recognition. Further still, it is disappointing that Facebook (now rebranded as Meta) has done so little to mitigate these issues. 

Ultimately, perhaps this product is merely not for me. However, I would recommend against it to anyone who is looking to use it for relaxation and absolutely insist that nobody use this for long periods as it can be dangerous - as is stated in the health and safety information included with the device.",1,1
2022-05-18 19:40:20.418609,"Overall, I think the Quest 2 is a great VR headset as it provides a full VR experience without the requirement of a separate computer for a price far below any competitor.  This doesn't mean that the Quest 2 necessarily provides an overall better experience, but as someone that has used the Vive, Vive Pro, Quest, and Samsung Odyssey, it's hard to ignore how much simpler this is.  However, there are some worthwhile things to note for any prospective buyers:

1. Facebook did simplify the headset as a means to help reduce the cost.  For example, IPD adjustment is not as effective on the Quest 2 as it was on the Quest.  Interpupillary distance (IPD) refers to the space between your eyes, and it is important to get this value correct on your headset to avoid feeling like you're not staring cross-eyed.  The original Quest provided a granular slider with options from 58mm to 72mm.  The Quest 2 provides three settings: 58mm, 63mm, and 68mm, which are set via physically moving both lenses (at the same time) inward or outward where an indicator at the top center will display 1 (58mm), 2 (63mm) or 3 (68mm).  This change was a bit problematic for me, because my IPD is 71mm, so I always feel a little bit cross-eyed while using the Quest as I'm forced to stare a bit inward instead of straight ahead.

2. You should consider getting accessories to better the overall experience.  Probably the worst offender is that the provided strap is not terribly comfortable.  The issue is that the Quest 2's weight is all located in the headset, which means you want a robust strap to allow for the back of your head to help remove the weight from your face.  You can either consider the strap that Facebook sells separately or a strap from a third-party vendor.  Personally, I use the latter.  If you use glasses, I would also strongly consider getting prescription lens adapters, and if you don't, you can buy similar adapters with non-prescription lenses.  The non-prescription lens can help protect your Quest 2's lenses.

3. If you are planning for a child to use this, be aware that the Quest 2's software does NOT support parental controls.  Similarly, the Quest 2 currently requires a Facebook account, and if you would prefer that your child not use Facebook, you would need to create one for them to use with the Quest 2 or use your own.  Facebook/Oculus have stated that they are looking to remove this requirement, but as of writing, nothing has been announced as to when this will occur.

4. You can use the headset with a computer if you want.  The headset supports displaying computer-based VR either through a cable or wirelessly through WiFi.  Just be aware that wireless will depend heavily upon your WiFi signal in the area that you're trying to use for play.

In the end, I think the best way to look at the Quest 2 is that it provides a great VR experience for its price point.  It's easy to point out how a headset like the HTC Vive Pro or the Valve Index are arguably better in certain ways, but they also cost considerably more and have additional hardware and setup requirements.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:40:20.418609,"I'm having a blast with this thing. There are some slight differences between this and the wired Oculus. 

You can't move around and decorate your home area (I really enjoyed that). 

I find downloading files a little irritating sometimes. If I select a game to download and then go plug it in, it promptly shuts itself down and stops the download. I have to leave it on and trick it by setting it on the chair, unplugged, and it usually downloads fine. 

The playtime is great for me but I'm a casual user and don't even like to play other games while I wait for the download, but I think I get a couple of hours of play out of a single charge. It takes forever to charge this thing, though. I'd have to guess, because I haven't timed it, but I probably get about one hour of play for every two hours of charge. 

It can be a little glitchy and I hate when it decides it can't find the internet but, if you compare it to the setup time on the original Oculus, that is almost petty in comparison. 

I was worried about getting the 128GB since the larger storage wasn't available but there's plenty of room to store a variety of games and, quite frankly, I've found that the games I like to repeat have to be removed and re-downloaded anyway. I don't know about all of them but the story games I like don't let you just wander back through your favorite chapters. For me, the extra space would be a waste so I'm glad this was all that was available. 

There are some great VR experience files for free and there are some free games too. The free games all look like multiplayer games, though. The most expensive games are around 30 bucks but some of them go on sale. There are cheaper games too and there are plenty of reviews on the internet for most of the games. There are reviews in the Oculus browser too, if you are inclined to trust those but, either way, you don't have to buy blind. AARP has a game bundle in the browser too so if you are looking for something for an older person who is trying to stay sharp, they can play this even if they aren't particularly mobile. 

Overall, this is AWESOME. I still wish they would allow you to download a home that is more like a stand alone game so you can interact with the environment. I'd even be willing to purchase a sim like home environment if they made them but, unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any options for that.

The other thing I wish it had was an actual sample of the 3D movement before you buy the game. They do have previews of the game but until you purchase the game, you just can't tell if it's going to move in such a way that you become disoriented. I get motion sickness and there are games that I can definitely play and games that make me feel sick after .034 seconds. I feel like they should have a better way of making sure you are compatible with the game before you purchase it.  

You can't beat the price for what this does and how easy it is to use while it does it. For any glitch or inconvenience, the enjoyment of leaping into another world and being blown away by the detail and movement is indescribable. The sounds on this are great and I don't use earbuds, I just use the built in speakers. I've used this almost every day since I got it and it, literally, sweeps me off to another world where I am so engrossed that I can't help but relax for awhile. What a joy.",5,5
2022-05-18 19:40:20.434230,"This is my first VR headset. I bought this one mostly because it's cheap, doesn't require base stations, and is able to be connected to a gaming computer to use SteamVR and such, rather than using it for the self-contained ability to play games. 

I didn't want to invest in a more expensive headset designed for gaming rig use, because I didn't want to drop more money on something that I may potentially not use due to the fact that I can get motion sickness pretty easily. I didn't want to deal with setting up base stations either, because it's not very convenient. I would've gotten the Rift S, but by the time I was in the market for a VR headset, they'd essentially discontinued it, unfortunately. As a result, this was my best option. 

It's pretty easy to figure out how to use. Strap it to your face, and do what the prompts tell you to get things set up, and then from there, if you want, you can hook it up to your rig. You simply plug a USB type C cable into the side of the headset, and the other end into the fastest USB port on your computer (it must be USB 3.1, if I'm not mistaken). 

So here's what's great about it: It's an excellent way of introducing yourself to the platform of VR without making a HUGE financial leap of faith, relative to other VR headsets anyways. You don't need a computer to use this, you simply need the headset and a phone in order to get things paired properly. There seems to be a decent selection of games that are compatible with it on the Quest app, most of the ones people would normally want to play, so there's no shortage of fun here. It's also really easy to let someone else try it out, if they've never had a VR experience. You don't need to drag someone to your place, or drag your gaming computer somewhere else, you can simply take the headset and a charger and you're good to go. I have only played it while connected to a computer, so I can't make any accurate comment on battery life, or performance in standalone mode, or anything like that, but I can say that this is a good value for people looking to get into the platform and figure out if it's the right thing for them. 
It was recently announced that there will no longer be a requirement to have a Facebook account in order to use it, if that's something that bothers you. It certainly bothered me for a while, at least. 

Here's the not so good things: The strap. The strap to keep this thing on your face is terrible. It's uncomfortable, it moves around way too much, it's not secure feeling, and adjusting it for other people to use it safely is a huge pain in the rear. You can purchase the elite strap, or some cheap knockoff of one, but the fact is that it comes with a garbage strap out of the box, and you'll need to pay more money to get one that doesn't suck. Given how cheap it is for VR, it's not that big of a deal, but it's definitely annoying, at the very least. 

The next thing is more of a complaint with VR as a platform rather than the headset, but the truth is that VR games are almost universally gimmicky. A gimmick isn't necessarily a bad thing, but VR games are more like arcade games than immersive, interesting experiences for the most part. There's certainly a few exceptions to this, but seriously, you're not going to find an immersive world or story in most of the games you'll come across (excluding ports, like Skyrim, for example). Beat Saber, Superhot, Pistolwhip and games like that are obviously fun, but there's really not much to them. It gets old quickly, and soon you don't play your headset for weeks at a time because when you've played the game enough, you're burnt out for a good while. 

This is, of course, not relevant to the headset itself, so I'm not counting it against the headset in the review or anything, but I felt it was something that you should be aware of if you're thinking of purchasing one. 

Overall, aside from the strap complaint, I think that this is a lovely headset for people who don't have a VR headset yet, and/or don't have a machine capable of running VR games. The strap is honestly really obnoxious to me which is why it cost the headset a star in this review, but that's not to say that this is a bad headset. It's definitely worth a try, at the very least!

For those of you concerned with motion sickness, by the way, here's my input. I get motion sickness pretty easily, and frankly, whether or not I feel sick with this depends solely on what game I'm playing or what I'm doing. I can play Beat Saber without an issue, but playing No Man's Sky made me feel horribly sick. Hanging around in the ""hub"" when you're not in a game made me very sick too. Playing Pavlov made me very sick. My mom put it on to try it out, and she got sick after about 45 seconds of looking around in the ""hub"" as well. In short, it depends on what game you're playing, and how prone you are to motion sickness to begin with.",4,4
