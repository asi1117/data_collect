2022-05-18 18:18:50.298665,Very nice.handiness and easy to use.it's very cool look like.,2022-05-18 18:18:50.298665,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.298665,"As always the packaging and unboxing is an experience in itself, and it's fun to get setup and turned on but honestly the pairing process was frustrating. 

One issue I had during setup was on my app it didn't show an option for Quest 2, and the app was up to date. So without any indication why it was because I didn't merge the FB account at first so it just wouldn't acknowledge the option of a Quest 2 even existing let alone pairing. This was frustrating for about 10 minutes and wish they'd made this clear this is how it would restrict non-FB access. 

Once setup, first impression were that the head strap included didn't adjust as dynamically to let me fit it more uniformly on my face, and with the removal of the eye adjustments and changing it to only 3 static settings, I see permanent edges on the edge of my vision now which is annoying when I notice it, although during play my brain blocks it from my conscious site. 

Once setup and in play, the headseat is lighter which is a big plus, and controllers feel a bit wider for a better grip, the image quality is smoother and cripser being higher resolution and refresh rate, and the load times are much better for the games I've played on both this and Gen 1. 

Overall if this is your first VR headset you will absolutely love it, but ultimately having both I've found myself using the Gen 1 more and letting my wife use the new one.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.298665,3,3
2022-05-18 18:18:50.298665,"Awesome investment! I’ve always wanted something different besides the average game console, AND I FOUND IT! Huge difference In game play between Xbox, PlayStation etc. If you’ve never tried VR  DO IT, it’s awesome. For the price the quality, and on top of all that, it’s mobile! Worth the money.. I think the only complaint I have is the battery only gives you about 45-1.5 hours of play time, so I had to purchase an external battery pac for it. Also when you have been on it for quite some time it does start to get a little warm/hot and does start glitching or freezing while on a game or whatever you may be doing at the time. other that that it’s a super buy.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.298665,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.313663,"Excellent stand alone VR headset, no PC required, easy to travel with, take it anywhere (dry) Can also play PC VR games if you connect to a PC. Charge it, download your games and play. Once games are downloaded, no WiFi needed. Multi player mode available online with friends, not all games.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.313663,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.313663,The oculus quest 2 is AWESOME I would totally recommend for anyone it is the best thing that has EVER entered this earth,2022-05-18 18:18:50.313663,5,5

2022-05-18 18:18:50.313663,"This is exactly what I wanted out of a VR headset. The stand alone portion of the Quest 2 is an excellent alternative to needing a strong gaming PC. Quest 2 optimized games are so far fluid and with great detail. The upgraded 90Hz refresh rate does make a nice  difference over the original Quest's 72Hz for smooth movement in games and applications. I have no regrets in purchasing this headset. My only gripe is the stock head strap is a little flimsy and doesn't really provide a great fit for extended use. I definitely recommend purchasing the Elite Strap for comfort and fit. The photos I've uploaded are with the Elite Strap installed, not the stock one.

Aside from the built in VR hardware you can use the Oculus Link cable for a pretty great PC VR experience. I've played many games via the Link and all have been great. It works equally well with SteamVR as it does with the Oculus software. I played Halflife: ALYX via SteamVR perfectly fine with the quest 2. The visual quality using the link cable is very nice. Just make sure your USB 3.1 drivers are up to date and Windows 10 has it's latest updates installed.

The included controllers are as good as any other VR controllers I've used. They are a little less cumbersome than the PSVR wands. They are also as good as the original Quest controllers. The battery life is better than the original Quest's. Make sure you use the attached hand straps to avoid throwing your controllers. Seriously, just use them.

My only regret, and I knew this going in, is the Oculus software and link are only supported on recent builds of Windows 10. I would love to have some sort of Linux support, even if minimal. But like I said I knew this going in so I didn't have unrealistic expectations. There is always the off chance the hardware will be reverse engineered and community created Linux support may be possible. But don't buy this headset with the hope of this happening.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.313663,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.313663,"Let me start with this. If you want to get an amazing VR headset, standalone or PC, without shelling out the big bucks, I highly recommend this.

Pros:
Lighter on your face
Higher resolution (1832x1920 per eye)
90Hz refresh rate (is currently locked to 72Hz but can be unlocked with some tinkering, will be enabled more easily in future update)
Amazing tracking
Up to 256GB of storage

Mehs:
Strap is uncomfortable (I’m picking up an elite strap today and will edit the review if I can)

Cons(?):
Facebook login required (I don’t really mind this but I understand that some people aren’t comfortable with this)
IPD adjustment (3 settings instead of a slider fixed at 58, 63, and 68 mm)",2022-05-18 18:18:50.313663,4,4
2022-05-18 18:18:50.313663,"I had the Oculus Quest (1) 
The first difference that I noticed is the material of this device, you can see a huge difference this white one does not looks pricey, it lighter you can really feel this while playing and that is the best, If I had to tell someone if they need to change your old device for the new one, I would says do it, sale your currentone and with that money the nee one, so you will be ready for the next games.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.313663,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.418645,"This is my first venture into VR and I couldn’t be happier. I’m not a big gamer and it was a week before I even tried one since I spent so much time looking at VR scenery around the world and watching concerts in virtual reality that made it seem like I was there. The exercise apps are also incredible and I am getting good home workouts. Once I tried a few games, I found them to be incredible and am now becoming a gamer. 

I also got the Logitech G333 VR earplugs that I recommend as they are designed for this device and can be left permanently  attached. 

This is a great device for gaming but even if you are not a gamer, it is worth getting.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.418645,5,5

2022-05-18 18:18:50.433623,Exactly as ordered. Could not be more pleased with the products. We have 3 Oculus Quest 2 and my family loves them.,2022-05-18 18:18:50.433623,5,5

2022-05-18 18:18:50.433623,I've never had VR before but I am really enjoying the Oculus Quest 2.  I find it's very comfortable to wear.  It's also very lightweight.  Just waiting for more games to come out. The virtual hands are really out of this world.,2022-05-18 18:18:50.433623,5,5

2022-05-18 18:18:50.448639,"I have done several VR games in physical locations and absolutely love this next level gaming style.  So naturally, when the Oculus Quest 2 came out, I did some extensive research on the product (youtube channels), and made the decision to purchase. 

I swear, this is probably the best purchase I could have made. As a huge star wars fan, I absolutely love the Vader Immortal episodes. There are 2 games I havent started yet, out of respect for my fiance and the fact that she wants to do this together, which are Thrill of the Fight and Pathogen. 

I usually lift weights in the evenings and after Im done, I'll put on the Oculus 2 and finish off with a light cardio at the light saber dojo. Make sure you place the settings for 360 attack. Another awesome feature that I have just figured out is that when Im fighting against droids and a laser is about to be shot in my back, I can move the light saber over my head and deflect the shot, then turn around and take out the remote droid shooting you. 

My fiances birthday is coming up in a week and I have ordered her an Oculus 2 and other accessories as there is a movie app called Big Screen in which we both can watch movies together in a virtual reality environment (movie theater, drive-in theater, campfire, etc), when I am gone on a business trip. 

Best part about this is that on long flights, I can put on the headset and watch stored movies and shows through the BigScreen movie App and completely immerse myself in the movie environment. I bought seperate battery from VRcover that gives an extended 8 hours of play to add onto the 2 hours you get with the Oculus Quest 2. Throw on a power bank and youll be playing for hours. Give the Oculus some time to cool down every hour or so. Other than that, absolutely perfect!

Another awesome feature is that I can sync my desktop from my laptop using the Desktop App, lay in bed, and undergo additional I.T. training as if Im sitting on a computer and studying. This thing is freaking awesome! 

Ive had this since the end of march and the more I use it, the more Im realizing its capabilites.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.448639,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.599781,"Santa got this for my 16 y/o son. I don't have much experience in VR, but this system blows me away. The controls are tricky to get used to, especially for the kiddos who are used to XBox controllers. If you have a weak stomach, you might not want to dive too deep. The tutorial was enough for me. Besides, just watching someone else do it is hilarious. For the price, whether it's the 64 ($299) or the 256 ($399), it would've been nice if it had at least ONE game included.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.599781,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.615145,"Great purchase! I had it shipped to my house without any problem. I got notified ahead of time letting me know when it would be delivered so it didn’t get stolen off my porch! Yay! In my opinion, The Quest 2 is way better than the Original Quest, with the exception of the controller button pad having the circle shape vs. teardrop shape on the original. The bigger circular pads keep you from being able to fully wrap your thumb around the controller. It only allows you to rest your thumb on top of the button pad next to the buttons, which makes it feel like you don’t have a solid grip when playing games where you want to swing the controllers as hard as you can (like Echo Arena). But, they do have better haptic feedback so it’s a trade off I guess. The headset is awesome though. It’s lighter, has better graphics, and better audio.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.615145,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.619136,I love my quest 2 and the fact you can communicate with others on the game system meet new people etc. You can travel everywhere do just about anything without leaving your home. I really enjoy it. The only problem I have is the headset straps hurt my head and gave me an headache so I can to purchase a different head gear from Amazon to make it comfortable also the games can be a bit pricey games range from 9.99 to about 40 dollars. Sometimes the games go on sale or have a bundle packs. You will need to purchase a extra battery to keep the vr charge if you want to play longer. Other than that I love it!,2022-05-18 18:18:50.619136,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.623158,"I own the First Oculus Quest 128GB and Bought this Oculus Quest 2 256GB for My Girlfriend. I was Curious to See how much better it was compared to mine. It is a Noticeable Difference. The Visual Quality is Much more Sharper and Clear. The System Seems to Load a bit Faster as well. It is Very Nice! I'm jealous. But, I like My Black Quest Better because I Modded it with the Deluxe Audio Strap from HTC. Plus, the White makes it look like it is for a Girl. 
My Girlfriend Loves it! She Mainly uses it for Exercise. Fit VR is here go to game. She is Happy! Which makes me Happy with My Purchase. Also, 256GB is Actual only 238GB due to OS installed. So imagine how much memory the 64GB Version actually has...? Probably 40GB Something to Consider if you plan on putting a lot of Games on it. Overall, it is Awesome! You will be Happy with it. See you in VR i'll probably be in the Casino playing Texas Hold Em' poker in ""Pokerstars VR""",2022-05-18 18:18:50.623158,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.626144,"Bought two of these because why not! It’s so fun playing games with my wife, it brings everyone together, I’m a VR lifestyle for life! The battery could use some work but with these extra battery packs on the head straps I purchased separately, it improved it, I have a lot of games downloaded already (32) and I still have so much storage space.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.626144,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.630105,"After waiting several years to jump into VR, this seemed like the right time to do it. First I have to say I am glad I got the 256 GB version, just for future proofing capacity. After using this unit for around 200 hours or so already, it is awesome fun. I had several friends get one as well, and we have had a riot playing mini golf, fishing, shooting Zeds.. playing Steam games , you name it... Using the link cable for steam works perfect. FYI I am using a very fast Desktop computer setup to play Steam games. I will say that getting the VR legs took a little bit of time, but doesn't bother me any longer. This thing is great.. if you are on the fence on getting VR, this is a great value, and works very well. I also got the elite head strap, and with the problems that were reported, i can say that mine is still fine. I have added an external 10,000Mah battery pack with a couple velcro straps that brings the battery life to 6-8 hours easily. Get one.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.630105,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.634109,"Amazing. 

I owned the original rift and being untethered is just amazing! Now if there were only more games and I had an empty room for roomscale it would be perfect.

Also get yourself a Vive digital audio strap from HTC, frankenquest adapter from Etsy, replacement face from vrcover and halo and grips from vrcover.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.634109,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.638112,As soon as I put that thing on it was a beast. Played onward and all other games flawlessly! I tried out the 90hz worked great! The strap on the headset though it took me like 20 minutes to get a good fit but after that it was great! I would recommend this headset to anyone! The controllers also feel so good to hold.,2022-05-18 18:18:50.638112,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.643070,The Oculus Quest 2 (256) GB storage is highly recommended because if you plan on purchasing lots of games this is the best way to go. The games are not very large to install. But I’m one of those kind of people that like to make sure I don’t run out of storage space.,2022-05-18 18:18:50.643070,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.647059,"Overall a good step forward but they cut corners in my opinion compared to version 1. Much prefer the cloth exterior, as well as the wider adjustment option for eye distance. In addition, I think going from 2 panel OLED to single panel LCD was a step backwards, regardless of the increase to resolution. The room headset also sits a little too close to the eyes so everything is very tight. Facebook would have been better off charging a little bit more instead of cutting corners to keep the price down. 

However, with faster refresh, higher resolution, and much more power this is a well worth while upgrade. Just understand the new “don’t have’s”",2022-05-18 18:18:50.647059,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.737234,"I've been exploring worlds and experiencing thing most people haven't seen. I actually built a world from the ground up with my hands. I've fought invaders to our kingdom with a bow and arrow. I've battled alongside aliens to defeat those who wished to destroy us. In my free time, I like to hang out above the earth and look down on the beautiful landscape it offers. 

Those who actually know me understand that everything i said just now is out of character for me, but I started playing the oculus quest (again out of character for me) and I honestly have a hard time putting it down.  

I've interacted with people all over the world, even in these difficult times, and met some great people in this virtual world. I don't write product reviews much, but I believe this system is breaking barriers that social media and other gaming systems have not been able to ( Facebook owns oculus and you have to have a Facebook account to play). 

I am so happy I stumbled across this,  especially in the midst of a pandemic. It truly brings me joy every time I use it.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.737234,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.737234,"I upgraded to this VR from the Samsung Gear VR since Oculus stopped supporting the Gear VR and so far I am very happy with this purchase. Exploring the VR environment is smooth as well as gameplay. Navigation takes some getting used to but not difficult at all. I really appreciate the ability to set room or spatial boundaries which will help you avoid bumping into things. I recommend getting the Population: One game which introduces new movement and mechanics in gameplay, overall a very fun game. The only small grip I have with the Quest 2 is that the battery only lasts about 2 hours of constant use, but maybe that's not such a terrible thing.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.737234,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.752232,"I really like the Quest 2 compared to the Oculus Rift S. It's more comfortable and you can move the lenses left or right. I gave it three stars though because it's not truly wireless like i thought it was going to be. Upon receiving it, I thought I would be able to play all the games I bought on steam or on the Oculus Rift S. This kind of wasn't the case. You can't play your games wirelessly unless you buy the Virtual Desktop, which is $20, and download a few things on your computer to connect the Vr too and then you will be able to play those games. Also, the head straps are super annoying, but other than that, It's really good for the price.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.752232,3,3

I was amazed at the difference.  This is LIGHT YEARS ahead of the PSVR, and has the ability to play QUEST optimized games wirelessly, or play PCVR games as well with Oculus link!  This is a no brainer, especially for the price.  There are issues people have with requiring a facebook login to use one of these, and I understand, by the online privacy boat sailed a long time ago for me so I don't have any issues there myself.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.771743,5,5

2022-05-18 18:18:50.779687,"The graphics are better than my previous VR headset Oculus Rift. I also bought the link cable to be able to play games that are for Oculus Rift. You can purchase an app VR Desktop that lets you play Oculus Rift games without any wires and anywhere in wifi range but batteries last about 4 hours of play time this is just an estimate haven't really timed it. the link cable which is about $75 keeps the battery charged while playing. I have really liked the Oculus Quest 2 no sensors, no wires, play anywhere, better graphics, words look better, games play fine with Link Cable or VR Desktop. Started ALYX-HALF LIFE with Oculus Rift but it died so I purchased the Oculus Quest 2 and cable link and the game looked and played better with the Quest2 and then I purchased the app VR Desktop and it played ALYX-HALF LIFE without any problems or use of link cable. I am glad in a way that my rift died because the Quest2 has been so much better to play and use.I would recommend the Quest2 with the link or the app VR desktop because there are so many more games to play. I have a I7-7700K with 32GB Ram and 2 NVIDIA 1070 Graphics cards and i am enjoying playing Medal Of Honor Above And Beyond with the Oculus Quest 2 and the VR Desktop app",2022-05-18 18:18:50.779687,5,5

I really love the VR gaming it is for sure a new way to game and interact with others that was never possible before at such a low price point.
I think the head set needs a little improvement the strap is a big PIA, I am really looking forward to the next one that comes out.  By then I think the small bugs and glitches will be figured out and the platform will also have a ton of more games. It dose get quite expensive to buy the games and have this fee and that fee for this and that.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.945240,4,4
2022-05-18 18:18:50.945240,"We bought this for our son for his birthday. Easy to set-up.  The one thing that I thought that should have been advertised is that it requires a Facebook acct. to play.  with our son only being 15 we haven't allowed him to have one. so we now have it linked to my acct.  but aside from that.  we have a blast playing with it.  it's fun.  depending on the game you are playing depends on the amount of battery life you have.  but with constant play, again depending on the game can last 2-5 hours.  headset is comfortable once adjusted to your head.

The controllers feel amazing in the hand and the tracking is superb. Ive used and have a PSVR and when I switched on the quest for the first time, I was amazed by the quality and stereo sound. It was enhanced by knowing that it is an all in one product that is portable and doesn’t need to be connected to a computer or use a wire that you can get tangled in. Having used VR before, I was still amazed and if you have never experienced VR, your mind will explode. Great price and quality.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.945240,5,5

The controls seem awkward at first but once you get used to them, they are easy to work with. I do recommend buying some grips to add to them to better secure them to your hands. I purchased some on Amazon that were $15 that work great. The headset is a bit heavier but stays on well. The overall experience compared to the Go is outstanding. It’s so much better being able to use both hands and you really feel immersed in the games. Saber is awesome, if you’re looking for somewhere to start.

I think I have had every game system that has come out throughout the years but this VR system takes gaming and entertainment to a whole different level.  

My first game was Real VR Fishing and I was in awe with the realism of this game. I spent 2 hours and 15 minutes playing this game when I downloaded it. 

My only issue is the strap that came with it.  I was getting headaches after about the second day but decided to buy a new headstrap from Amazon and let me tell you...…What a big difference!!! It feels more secure and not so heavy on my face.  

I also bought a new blue silicone cover mask for sanitary reasons.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.960212,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:50.960212,"Very fun; easy my boyfriend and I love it. Only reason I knocked off a star is because battery life. It lasts maybe 2 hours of play time and then it’s dead and needs to go on the charger. I know there’s additional things you can purchase to make the battery last longer. But as far as just this item goes, it’s one of my only complaints. 
Also, I love how I am able to play this with my glasses on. That is definitely a great perk!
We bought multiple games for it right away from the oculus app and have been in love since. Can’t wait to get accessories to help with battery life so we can play it longer than a couple of hours at a time.",2022-05-18 18:18:50.960212,4,4

The inclusion of a higher resolution display and support for WiFi-6 was reason enough for me to upgrade. Others may take issue with the Facebook requirement, the switch to an LCD screen from OLED, and the 3 choice IPD adjustment (rather than the slider on the original Quest), but the price to quality ratio makes this a no brainer for anyone looking for their first VR headset. It’s a wonderful all in one, stand-alone experience, but couple it with a capable PC and you’re ready to go toe to toe with headsets 3 times the price.

No wires, no towers, no ridiculous setup, just a headset and two well-designed controllers. This is one of the most cost-efficient and comfortable VR headsets currently on the market, and the upgrades from the original Quest to the Quest 2 make it my overall favorite at the moment.

Just got sick after playing for more than 30 mins.  My wife nor myself suffer from motion sickness and have been on many cruises and boats with no issues.  This thing would make us sick though.

The speakers are fine but the experience gets even better with headphones for earbuds. Battery life is okay for the average user but if you are a person who plays for hours and hours at a time, i recommend either a battery bank or the Elite Strap with battery. The quality of the screen is also great, its crisp enough for games and movies. The storage that i have bought is the 256 GB but this is not at all necessary, the 64 GB version is enough for up to 10 or more games and some Photos or Videos.

There are a ton of accessories available to customize and make the experience most comfortable to you. My only complaint is the battery life which is about 2 hours and the time to charge is about 2 hours. But, that is expected with something this powerful in a wireless package.

I first bought the 64gb version but discovered I really needed more space. So I gave it to my sister and bought the 256gb version. I would say if you plan to do any gaming you should go for the larger memory. This headset is well made, sturdy and does all it claims.

1.) I wish there were some sort of detachable face guards.  When we play as a family games like say, Beat Saber, it’s really gross swapping the VR as the foam just soaks up any sweat. I put it on after the next person and it’s just sopping with sweat. Gross. There’s no way to wipe it off. I’m reluctant to purchase any work out games for this reason. 

2.) I wish it was easier to adjust to fit your head. More difficult on heads with long hair as you have to grab and pull to adjust and hair gets pulled along with it.",2022-05-18 18:18:51.101513,4,4

Playing games on this vs. the PSVR really shows it's pitfalls. It can't keep track of hand movements, so when playing Beat Saber or other games that require lots of hand and arm movement, you'll just lose

Facebook doesn't offer giftcards, so gifting kids the ability to buy things on their own isn't possible. The Oculus is pointless. Just buy a PS then get the PSVR...it's the exact same cost when you factor in all the extra accessories you have to by just to make the Oculus Quest 2 workable",2022-05-18 18:18:51.120808,1,1

Takes some fiddling with the straps to get the right fit, and the battery has been lasting around 2-2.5 hrs.  I[m looking forward to higher resolution in future models, but the built in speakers are extremely crisp and clear, and i haven't found the need to use any headphones yet.

Add in the facts that you can use a stationary or adjustable guardian and that most games are cheap and it’s no wonder this is the VR set to buy right now. Some downsides are that your face rests on foam that is a sweat sponge and don’t expect great battery life if you just play games that use lots of rumble and tracking, but even without using this for exercise there is a ton to see in VR.

I will buy more later on for sure. I myself need one. I'm always using my kids Oculus 2. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because the battery drains quick. Last about an hour to 2 hours. Then after 10 minutes of using it my cheek hurts so much. The Oculus is heavy so it weighs down on your cheek area adding pressure to your sinus areas. I also would like for Oculus to create a family account so I won't be buying the game 3× on each headset. Most games are $15-$50.,2022-05-18 18:18:51.134904,4,4

I tried to problem solve it without success until I switched to my Quest 1. That solved the problem. I played SURV1V3 without any lag.

There’s many free downloadable games and many great deals. Regular game price run from 30-50$ most are about 30$.

Text is easier to read, which is huge in games like Elite Dangerous, where you're in a cockpit reading various panels.

I've had a bit of trouble with tracking in low-light. I didn't realize that was the problem at first, so be sure to play with enough ambient light that your hands don't ""disappear"" and go flying all over the room in the middle of your gaming session.

Games range from $10-30, but there is also a good deal of free content out there too. 

The one thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the strap. I highly suggest getting the Pro Strap that Oculus makes, but it really should come standard.

The oculus quest 2 itself is amazing. Out of the box it is comfortable compared to the original oculus quest. The controllers are slightly larger, easier to hold, the battery “door” doesn’t slide off while playing intense games and the battery usage is far less in comparison to the quest 1. 

This is the best option if your looking to get into VR as it doesn’t require a PC but you can link it to a pc or even play pc games wirelessly if you have the proper set up and do some research. 

The Quest 2 is really easy to set up and use just make sure your IPD won’t be an issue as the IPD settings are the only thing that has been down graded in my personal opinion in comparison to the original oculus quest.",2022-05-18 18:18:51.254923,5,5

The only thing this thing has going for it is it's wireless The graphics are not very good at all Even when you hook it up to the PC they are not very good at all. I bought six game for this thing and every one of them look the same The only one that actually looked any good was the Star wars game and I'm just assuming that was because it was made by a company that actually had a lot of money to put into it but the graphics were still not like they should be for our time that were in for gaming at the moment. Now the fact that it's wireless that was awesome I wish the PlayStation would figure it out for their VR system and do it wirelessly.,2022-05-18 18:18:52.084262,1,1
2022-05-18 18:18:52.134129,"Excellent if you need a portable VR system. Battery life is pretty decent and this is amazing cord free solution. Can be paired to PC with link cable but I have not tried that. Screen door effect is very good in terms of being less noticeable. Personally I enjoy the HTC Vive more, however if you need a cable free system this would be the best solution. This system is less powerful if you do not link to PC, but that is an option as well so give it a shot. Awesome entry level VR for certain games. VR Chat needs a lot of processing power though and you do not get the full experience with this headset unlinked.",2022-05-18 18:18:52.134129,5,5

The package was left on my porch with the word OCULUS showing so big that you could see it from the street! If we didn't have an Echo Show, I would not have known it was there. That could have been a $400 porch pirate's dream! I indicated online that I was purchasing as a gift! My daughter saw the package on the Echo Show in the kitchen and had to block the screen from my husband.

The battery power isn't great but 2-3 of play is impressive concidering it's an untethered standalone vr kit and the ability to attach to a pc for pcvr games is great! Most games are about $15 and there's tons of free content and ways to get cheap and free games. Logging into FB is a drawback but not worth complaining about since it doesn't make you do anything but use your FB to login. You can choose a username in-game so there's no way anyone can find you if you don't want them to.

There wasn’t enough variety on the oculus game store to keep me entertained for hours on end. Games are also a little expensive for what you get (sometimes). Some games are packed with content, others are short and have virtually no reason for you to play it again so do your research before you buy a game. 

There is something for everyone though. Ping pong, shooters, a battle royale game, poker etc.

Pro: the quality is amazing if you have been waiting for VR quality to get better before getting into it this is a product for you.
The controllers feel good in your hands.
It captures your hand movements amazingly with the controllers
You can change to controller free controlling which still works great in tracking your hand and fingers
I promise, try it and you will not regret it.

I use this for both entertainment and business.
With apps like Immersion, we hold meetings and share desktops

Beat Saber is a must buy game. The entire family is having fun and getting an arm workout!  Other virtual ""experiences"" we have tried so far include a shooting range and roller coasters. The range was absolutely fun! The roller coasters take a bit to get used to.

After my oculus would no longer work correctly we took it to Best Buy with my receipt showing I had the warranty on it and absolutely no questions were asked they replaced it and I could have gotten my money back after that but decided to keep the warranty because who knows, right?

The immersiveness is also left up to what app you are using, some do it better than others. As being one of the popular VR headsets out there, the accessories available are endless and some are must have particularly those that offer longer battery life.

The battery life will deplete depending on how intensive the experience is. I would also suggest you wait prior to purchasing this if you do not wish to you use a Facebook account.

I would definitely tell you to buy either the elite strap or the elite strap with battery though, the included strap is actually worse than every 'pro' review I've read.

They only issue I've had so far is getting the headset to fit comfortably. I've been told that most of the ""elite"" after market headbands should alleviate this....we'll see.  As for now, I'm still very pleased with this purchase.",2022-05-18 18:18:53.172160,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:53.187159,I owned the oculus rift and had a lot of fun with it BUT it had a lot of wires and those dang motion sensors had to be connected to pc which took a lot of USB ports. So naturally I wanted to replace it with something that didn’t have so many wires and accessories to take up ports. I was hesitant about getting the quest 2 because in my head I thought it was just a beefed up “place your cell phone in here” type of headset but boy was I wrong. It plays all my crap stuff on my pc with a usb-c cable I purchased separately for it. Amazing head tracking with no sensors! Yay! Love this quest 2!,2022-05-18 18:18:53.187159,5,5

My wife didn't really play games with me, was hard to get her to play anything. With the Quest 2, she played way more than I have. I love using the Quest 2, it's so fun and there are many games where you can actually get a good cardio workout. This is hands down, one of the best investments for this cheap. I was waiting to buy the LG's new style 60"" OLED TVs, but there's no point as I cannot get the new video cards.. and besides, they increased the price point on their TVs.

Great screen resolution with no screen door effect is what we have been waiting for in the vr world. The ability to hook it up to you computer and play Rift games is a nice feature too. Warning! If you have had a Rift or a Rift s you will have to re buy some games you have already bought for the quest 2 such as Beat Saber, onward, Arizona sunshine etc. The 256 gb is a little overkill as my biggest game, the walking dead: saints and sinners is only 7gb or so.

Oculus supplies an extender for the faceplate that is supposed help with this, but it is such a small extension that it doesn’t help relieve the pressure at all in my case. The tightness that you need on the head straps in order to keep the optics aligned and stable will absolutely smash your glasses into your face with much discomfort.

Putting on the glasses adapter you had to pull the straps to an extremely uncomfortable level to get close to having clarity but the plastic glass adapter is hard plastic and digs into you forehead.  Without the glasses adapter you had to pull the straps extremely tight and snug , again to a very uncomfortable level to gain clarity.  For the price, it was definitely not worth the aggravations.  Suggest you review consumer reports and the issues everyone is having with this...the common denominator is clarity by far.  Many many disappointing reviews on this product.",2022-05-18 18:18:53.232151,1,1

This is my first VR experience, and I was surprised at the realism and what it can do.  I also figured out that roller coasters feel real - so I'm skipping them = had to close my eyes!  LOL.

There are some things I wish they actually put in a manual, like:
1) Hold the power button down to turn it off
2) There is a volume button on the bottom of the headset (took us a couple months to discover that)
3) HOLD the Oculus button to recenter the screen (the sideways O)
4) Tap the Oculus button to get to the Oculus menu so you can quit whatever you were in...

Thinking about getting the additional battery head strap as we run down the battery pretty consistently because EVERY member of our household loves the device.  We have used it every day since we have gotten it.  The trick is to get to it once it recharges before someone else in the family does!  We love it and are blown away by the content available.

The head piece itself is very light and feels secure on the head.  The hand joysticks are better and feel weighty in the hands.  Very happy to have this version. I like both but the quest 2 is obviously better.  A great improvement and addition to my experience within the VR world

Very easy to set up guardian area to define play space and avoid damaging things or yourself.  Wide selection of games/experiences.  Some will definitely get you sweating, so I recommend a silicone face insert.  For group/party play also highly recommend casting to tv (e.g. chromecast), so others can see/hear what you're doing instead of just watching you flail around.",2022-05-18 18:18:53.397121,5,5

I was also impressed by the audio and how the speakers are positioned with in the headset so that the player can hear but it's not loud enough to bother others.  I also like that you can stream this to the oculus app to watch the game play.  The fit and comfort of the headset is also great.  I have a feeling that we will be purchasing another one for us to use.  The only downside is the mandatory facebook account which we had to create one since our daughter did not have one nor is she old enough to have one.

This will literally transport you into other worlds.  The online content for virtual tours of places is also really cool.   I like that this is a self contained unit so it travels well.

The headset is a bit on the heavy side but comfortable. The straps be easily be adjusted front-to-back and side-to-side for the best fit. You can also use a spacer to make extra room for glasses. Most size glasses should fit fine in the gear but oversized frames will not.

The hand controls are easy to learn and easy to use. The feedback is great and I have not had trouble with lag. The system as a whole is very responsive. The speakers and microphone are very clear. 

The OS is very user friendly and the system walks you though many tasks when first being set up. The audio controls even understands my Pittsburgh English. The tracking technology is amazing, a very scary type of amazing.

Quest store is convenient and easy to navigate. I love being able to purchase games directly on the headset and be able to take it with me and play. Setting up the headset with your PC (I play through Steam VR) can be a process on initial set-up. After that it’s pretty smooth sailing. What I didn’t know about the headset is that the graphics vary between steam vr and the quest store. In my opinion, steam vr  graphics  are way better than buying directly through the quest store. The catch though, is you have to plug your headset into the PC while playing games through steam vr. 
Overall, highly recommend this headset. Haven’t had any issues playing any games (yet) both through quest store and steam vr.",2022-05-18 18:18:54.018762,5,5

My mind was blown within seconds of trying this out! So impressive how far VR has come. The resolution and the experience in general is great. The games have all been fun, although some are a little on the expensive side. 

Oculus link is a great option to use the headset with your PC but the cable is pretty expensive also. 

Altogether I think Oculus Quest 2 is a great deal for what you're able to do with it.  Now if I can just get past the motion sickness I will use it more!",2022-05-18 18:18:54.148277,5,5

The meditation subscription Tripp is wonderful. The visual imagery is amazing to me.  The head strap that comes with it is very uncomfortable with hard plastic pieces.

2022-05-18 18:18:54.361801,"This is a lot of fun to play.  It's amazing how far VR has come over the past few years.  I would give it 5 stars, but the right side eye has a much smaller field of view than the left.  If the headset is not positioned perfectly, the right eye seems blurry, or double visioned.  If you're interested in one of these, I wouldn't let that deter you though.  Unless you want to pay the premium for an HTC headset, this is a great deal.  Also, you're supposed to be able to connect this to a computer for better performance, so maybe that would make it more appealing compared to the more expensive options.  I would highly recommend this for the excercise options like Beat Saber, however the explore games like Star Wars are fun too.",2022-05-18 18:18:54.361801,4,4

But you will definitely need 2 if you are playing multiplayer games in your own house.  The strap that came with sucks really.

2022-05-18 18:18:54.496807,"This Quest 2 has made a lot of improvements from the Q1, and I now own both. My Q1 was awesome, and I had enjoyed my first experience into VR with it. Now this Q2 is ten times better with the higher resolution to almost 4K the details are much clearer that it made replaying my games, like Arizona Sunshine much better. The headset is much lighter, so there is lesser weight at the front. No need for counter weight. The headset runs faster and smoother, and it being an all-in-one, like the Q1, it is ready to play right out of the box. The best VR for everyone to experience that do not have a gaming pc!! But if you have a gaming pc, like myself, the link cable is a plus bc you can play more titles with the Oculus Rift library and SteamVR. Yes, you have to have a Facebook account, and you have to sign in with the headset. But I have Facebook for a decade now, so I don’t have an issue with fb showing me more options of what I was searching. Even though my Reverb G2 is my preferred pcvr headset... the Q2 is the one I put on when I want to quickly play some vr without booting up my pc. Like all my headsets, I’ll equipped it with a lot of accessories and protection. GET THIS Q2... and you won’t regret it!!! Enjoy!!!",2022-05-18 18:18:54.496807,5,5

2022-05-18 18:18:54.691759,My only complaint is that within the first month of using the Oculus the charging cable and charging cube both went bad. Not a major issue considering the oculus will charge using any C type USB cable so that was a quick and easy fix. Other than that I've had no other issues with it so far (going on 3 months of use) the games are fun to play. It being wireless just adds to the experience unlike using the PS4 VR headset. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to give VR a try and even to those that haven't had a chance to experience a wireless VR headset.,2022-05-18 18:18:54.691759,5,5
2022-05-18 18:18:54.691759,It’s pretty cool. The graphics are very good.My only complaint is my child had an allergic reaction from wearing it less than an hour. The company has a specific page for allergic reactions which I find very odd. My kids played the PlayStation VR and never had an issue. The company sent me a third party replacement made of a soft material. My son hasn’t had a reaction to that face replacement. It would have been helpful if it was originally made of high quality materials for the money we spend on it. The issue was resolved after answering MANY questions about the use of our system. The only reason why we bought this was because it’s wireless. If it wasn’t for the wireless we would have just continued with our PlayStation VR.,2022-05-18 18:18:54.691759,3,3

Games like Start Wars Vader Immortal, Beat Saber, and Pistol Whip can keep you going for hours. There's stuff from golf, to boxing, or horror games and zombie shooters. What sets the Oculus Quest and Quest 2 apart from the competition is the ability to work standalone OR with a gaming PC.

Just make sure you research all that before you buy. Me i wanted one now and had the money so hopefully i get my money worth. One thing i learned is i had to change the setting on it to not match the  North American united States hz 60 hz to 50 hz for some reason an update they did set it back to 60 hz. If you youtube this issue it will explain why and how to do it. I thought i was going to have to return it because it wouldnt see my remotes but once i changed it they worked perfectly also you HAVE to have a real facebook account bot a fake one because if they find out its fake your oculus will be worthless,2022-05-18 18:18:54.826718,5,5

Given the rarity in seeing my daughter surprised and extra excited for anything, I also love this thing. Every day she grabs this guy with the same excitingly joy as it’s been given as a gift over and over again. Furthermore, it’s unbelievable to see her wipe it down and put it back within the box after each use ... I’ve never seen her take care to anything she’s owned before as she does to this.

I'm sure that most VR devs will be putting most of their games and apps on the Quest as it's headset most VR users have.

Taking away star because the default headstrap is terrible. It doesn't support the weight of headset well and it's not comfortable to wear. Definitely invest in a 3rd party head strap if you are interested in the Quest",2022-05-18 18:18:54.841719,4,4

I barely get any time to play this now as my son has taken over the device to “virtually chill” with all his Quest buddies around the world.  VR is a life saver during the COVID-ERA.

I'm still working on adjustments for the nose but I'm enjoying it a lot. My only disappointment is that I thought the Oculus came with full games such as Jurassic World or Star Wars. They need to be installed separately for cost. I do like however how it shows the user how to maneuver the joysticks and how it has you measure a safe area to move around.

I have never used VR before, but if you want to immerse yourself into the virtual world, this is definitely one headset you'd want to purchase.  The graphics are incredible and you feel like you are in the places that you are taken.

My mom came over and tried it and fell in love. She’s getting one too. I feel like the oculus quest 2 is the way VR should of been introduced to the world (not that insert your cellphone here) type of equipment lol hands down the best thing to escape reality. I ended up getting the 256 gigs which isn’t necessary as of yet because there’s not much games that take up more than 10gigs of data yet.,2022-05-18 18:18:55.051680,5,5

With a couple of software to download you can play your whole oculus pc game or steam library without any wires.  Not going to lie. It does look a little better on the rift because of decompression but hopefully they figure out how to get the best of the quest 2 in future patches. I would get this over the rift because I can play anywhere in the house and not just next to my pc. I can sit outside and do things on my pc desktop which is 50 feet on the other side of the house with the quest.,2022-05-18 18:18:55.051680,4,4

No more screen door effect, where you can see pixels.  The only knock on this is the IPD spacing isn't fluid like the last version.  You have 3 settings that will hopefully match the distance between your eyes.  Other than that, this is a buy.

Lasts for a super long time before needing changed. Ability to use link cable or now stream games from computer with Virtual Desktop is also a huge plus.

A great selection of games and new releases are constant in the store. The resolution is Amazing compared to Oculus Go and the Battery life has improved drastically for the Oculus models.

I think the most fun is had when he is playing Monkey Tag with people all over the world. I can watch the game on a computer as he plays. The graphics are great, controllers are comfortable in the hands. I highly recommend getting a better headband so the system stays on your head better and a storage/carrying case. It is also worth the extra cash to get the extra memory space. Great fun!",2022-05-18 18:18:55.111668,4,4
2022-05-18 18:18:55.126666,This is the first time experiencing VR and I have to say I am super impressed by how well it works.  I got the 256GB version because I wasn't sure future wise how big content will be.  I have used this on its own as a VR headset as well as I plugged it into my PC using Oculus Link to play FS2020 in VR.  Both experiences worked without any issues and made me realize that VR is the next big thing that will change our lives.  If anyone is on the fence about VR I would suggest getting the Quest 2.  I know a lot of people complain about having to use your facebook account as the login but it doesn't bother me at all.  I just change the privacy settings so only I can see my activity.  It was very easy to setup and start using right out of the box.,2022-05-18 18:18:55.126666,5,5

The only down side is that the head strap is not the most comfortable. However, it is good enough to get through a 1-2 hour gaming session. The optional Elite Strap is strongly recommended Also, the lenses tend to fog up, especially if it's cold.  Lastly, the facial interface is not very comfortable.  It's a bit rough against the face.

It’s more so with games that you can move around in game, while your body isn’t moving IRL. I can’t recommend trying if not just getting a VR headset before you buy!

Another dad said the roller coaster ride made him threw up.  I'd say for kids its great but as adults get older the unbalance in our ears might make some games unbearable.  Setting up took a bit- my husband did it and was cursing under his breath.  I'd say set at lease an hour to do it and if gifting I would recommend doing it before hand so when it's open it can be played immediately.,2022-05-18 18:18:55.261642,5,5

On top of that you can always buy a link cable and use your PC to use it like a dedicated PC VR setup. Oculus outdid themselves with this one. My only complaint is that there isn't enough cushioning in the nose cutout to make sure your eyes are isolated from outside light and they make you buy a different pad to solve this issue.",2022-05-18 18:18:55.291636,4,4

I've been using the HTC Vive since it was released, but it was always inconvenient to set up and every time we move it takes months before I get around to setting up the base stations. With the Quest 2, you can be playing within minutes of unboxing it. Sure, the tracking isn't quite as good, but it's not game breaking, and the ability to wirelessly stream from a PC to keep using games I already own is great.

One of the biggest problems with VR has been the lack of wide spread adoption. The need for expensive PC hardware on top of the headset and complicated setup, or settling for low res phone quality games made it unappealing for many.

The Oculus Quest 2 is beyond impressive in many ways. It’s affordable. It doesn’t require any other devices, such as a computer or extra sensors.

Bought two more the next day. Now, we have THREE of these in the house (each has our own) complete with docking stations to charge batteries! Since our original purchase, we have had no fewer than 3 other people go and make the purchase as well. They are AMAZING! 
A few items to note: 
1) If you wear glasses, there are companies online that can make lens inserts for you. They take a couple weeks to get. I use a prescription that includes ""prism"" lenses and they are phenomenal. The company we ordered from is actually in Thailand and they did a perfect job with them. They are actually clearer and protect your Oculus from accidental damage from your regular glasses.
2) You can decorate the fronts with ""skins."" We made our own with the vinyl cutting machine. Be sure not to cover the cameras.
3) Invest in silicone protectors for the ""halo"" portion of your controllers. You WILL hit stuff with them. Buy them reasonably from that famous online retailer for cheap. If you get the full covers, you can't charge them on the Official charger sold by Best Buy.
4) Have a good spot to store and protect your device; as well as a GOOD microfiber cleaning kit.
5) Turn on the calorie counter with the ""move"" app if you are interested in using this to get some exercise.
6) Spend the time to get it adjusted to your eye position and your head size/ shape.
7) Spend the time to get to know your device - play with all the settings, watch online videos, become acquainted - don't rush into playing games before you are ready.
8) have lots of light around you (for the cameras) and for the love of all that's holy - remember to take drink breaks!
9)) Had we known how awesome these were, we have gotten them sooner!

We bought 2 headsets thinking we could play together or buy a few games on each that were shareable but instead you would need to buy 2 of the same game to have on both headsets or take turns exchanging headsets with one another rather than play together.",2022-05-18 18:18:55.876532,3,3

The graphics and games are extremely realistic looking and makes you feel as if you’re really a part of the scenario and scene. Price is not bad for this item for the 256mb. The only downside to this purchase is that Oculus does not currently allow multiplayer, multi avatars, or a family option. If someone wants to play the same game on your system that you’ve paid for and downloaded and have an established avatar, the game will require deletion of the existing avatar to add. New player. All of your saved game data is lost. Oculus needs to update and provide multiplayer use or it’s not worth the purchase for a family with a couple of kids since they are not able to have their own avatars or share games.",2022-05-18 18:18:55.891532,4,4

The biggest con is this thing is heavy and for long term use it could make you feel like your forehead weighs 5 lbs more and if you can deal with the heft of this thing then you will love it. There may be some more comfortable cushion inserts to help.. I would definitely recommend this VR

I guess I really thought the quality of games would be much more realistic. If you’ve ever seen the 1992 movie The Lawnmower Man, then you might know what I mean by lack of quality. Those were high end graphics then. Why, in 2021, are the graphics so corny? I have found that YouTube 360 videos can be quite fun.",2022-05-18 18:18:56.041502,5,5

Other than that he seems to love it.t I like that  you don't have wires that get all wrapped up i around u. I do think it's easier to set up than the PlayStation VR.

There just isn't a ton of content out there yet, and anything with high production value is really short. For example, the star wars games can be knocked out in an afternoon.

My son loves the Oculus and to be honest I like it as well.  It has something for everyone in terms of content and the library keeps growing.  The only reason I rated it a 4 is due to the fact you cannot use it without it being connected to a facebook account, and the fact that they are sold individually so you have to purchase multiple devices if you have more than one user in the house and they want to interact together in the VR realm. It was also somewhat challenging to find quality accessories or replacement pieces for it in stock anywhere.  Some of the ""off brand"" items aren't quite up to snuff.",2022-05-18 18:18:56.131489,4,4

2022-05-18 18:18:56.251466,"I can't recommend the Quest enough! This device will change your life! Seriously.

Before reading this review, understand that I am not comparing it to other headsets on the market. This review is evaluating the Quest for what it is meant to be... The Quest is a casual VR headset. It is not intended to be compared to $700+ VR headsets or powerful gaming computers.
I think of the Quest as the Nintendo Switch of VR headsets. It's perfect for doing what it has been designed to do.
I play every night. I'm 45 and I have lost over 20 pounds since I purchased my first Quest three months ago. When the Quest 2 came out, I bought it on release day.
I purchased the 256GB model because I am interested creating 3D video and storing media on it permanently. However, if I was just using it for games, I would have only purchased the 64GB version. The largest game is 5GB (The new Star Wars game) but most are well under 2GB. Like a smartphone app, once you purchase a game or app, you own it and can uninstall and re-install it as often as you'd like.
The setup is easy. VR games are something that you have to experience to appreciate and the Occulus Quest is the perfect device for introducing yourself or anyone else to the possibilities of VR.
I believe that the Quest's strengths are in social VR experiences, fitness, and casual gaming.
If you are looking to play flight simulators, AAA games, or graphic-intensive gaming, the Quest is the wrong device and you will need to invest at least $700 in the headset, not to mention a $1500+ gaming computer to connect it to.
The Quest is an all-in-one device, although you can also connect it to a PC and use it to play the fancy stuff too.
There are only a few negatives:
1. The construction is not excellent. VR headsets are not intended for anyone under 13, so this Quest expects the user to take care of the device. It's sturdy enough to withstand anything the average adult might use it for, but I wouldn't trust it to hold up to a birthday party of 10-year-olds.
2. The screen contrast isn't as nice as most cell phones. The blacks are more of a dark gray. However, the resolution is Amazing and it will only get better as Oculus unlocks some of the more advanced features that are currently disabled to make the headset compatible with the previous generation.
3. The game/app library is somewhat limited. However, it is continuously expanding and there are also ways to sideload games that aren't in the official Oculus library. This is a nerd thing, but it's not difficult for anyone who is even slightly comfortable tweaking with the settings of their gadgets.
The best of the Oculus Quest:
1. This headset is worth every penny! If you've never played games in VR, it will change your life. If you are a heavy VR user, you will love the ability to play without being tethered to your computer by a cable.
2. Welcome to the community. There are Oculus users all over the world and you will quickly discover that they are eager to help others learn the tips and tricks of the ""culture.""
3. You will get in better shape. Unless you already get your heart rate over 120 at least once a day and stretch regularly, you will see changes in your physical fitness. Finding games that don't require above average physical activity is difficult. I actually bought extra foam mask inserts from Oculus because I don't like swapping sweat with the people I show it to.
If you buy any extras for the Oculus 2, I recommend buying third-party accessories. The extra strap, Link cable, and case made by Oculus are vastly inferior to the similar priced (or in many cases lower-priced) third-party alternatives.",2022-05-18 18:18:56.251466,5,5

Pros:
No cables (Even to connect to PC through Virtual Desktop Paid)
Very comfortable and intuitive controllers.
Setup is fast and no external sensors to worry about
Great visual and minimal screen door effect.

Cons:
2 Hour battery is great to prevent long sessions but wish it could be longer.
Can be front heavy and adds a little more pressure than PCVR headsets.
White headstrap gets dirty easily.

Had to recover my account and ensure I updated all of my privacy settings since I don’t really use facebook and would prefer people don’t suck me back into facebook. Only other minor downside is there are a few games I always wanted to play that are unavailable because they are exclusive to other brands.

For the cost it's too good to be true. So I'm skeptical about the longevity of this unit. Currently the best games are on steam or just flat out expensive. I installed ALVR on my PC but if you want to pay for a less troublesome experience, try Virtual Desktop then use Steam VR after.

This issue also lead me to consider downgrading to the 64gb, but during this time quest 2 volume was stretched thin.

It's easy to setup, though it forces you to have a facebook login, for obvious reasons. To protect others around you and your household items, the virtual boundary is a nicely implemented safety feature. There are some cool games, my favorite so far has been the pingpong - where you can practice and play with AI at different levels..simply amazing.

Even the “cartoony” games without the realistic graphics just suck you in.

We ended up with two (shipping issue right before Christmas- FedEx lost it!) so we ordered another for pickup for Christmas Eve, same day the missing one showed up, a week late! We are ended up keeping both and thank goodness we did, with 4 of us dying to play constantly 2 was definitely required!

Now, Oculus has their own version of wireless streaming that works pretty well too. Playing VR without wires is what this headset is all about! The only downside to owning this system is that you have to have a facebook account connected to use it.

One of the coolest features I am stumped about is that if you leave a certain area that you have previously marked, the headset has a grayscale camera that reveals what's in front of you.

The equipment is built well and easy to understand.  Some of the games definitely take some training to get used to how to operate the controls, but most are fairly easy to understand. The system does not come loaded with a bunch of games you don't want, just enough to get you up and going, and that is nice. 
Negatives about the system. For the money that you do pay for it, it would have been nice to get some credit for some game purchases. Also the system is not set up to support multiple player usage. So basically the entire shares one account.

If you have 2 devices, the secondary account on the one with app sharing and the other one is using the admin account then all is good.  If you have a third one you have to buy the apps on that one because app sharing across up to four accounts only works on one device.  If you want to play most games in multi player mode as your own user then you will have to purchase the apps on the third device.  Only a few games will allow two devices to log in with the admin account with the third as a different user on the app shared device.  This needs to be changed from a device sharing to a user app sharing.  Define your shared accounts within the oculus and good to go, but for now, not worth buying a third device.",2022-05-18 18:18:57.827769,1,1

Hate the Facebook integration. I cannot for the life of me understand why that is mandatory. But thankfully for me, I haven't faced any issues with getting locked out etc. 
Hate the fact that the perfect viewing angle is very elusive. I always feel that something isn't in focus. 
Don't like the graphics and text being jagged. Very irritating. 

Like the fact that it is simple to set up. Starts working without too much hassle. 
Love it when my older folks get to view immersive videos and enjoy them.

So family members can't play games with each other unless they are willing to invest some serious cash on the games. But they can play online with any unknown stranger around the globe who happens to be online. 
Shame shame shame on Facebook yet again. So glad I've never used any of their services in the past, only created a ""fake"" account to be able to use this headset.

CONS:
* battery life is about 2.5hrs on a full charge (this can be extended to another 2.5hrs, total of 5hrs, if you purchase the Elite Head Strap with Battery)

The Star Wars games are worth the headset alone just to swing a lightsaber around.

Why it's 4 and not 5. Price. They trick you in thinking that the Quest 2 is a greater value compared to Quest 1.

Can buy a ""link cable"" to connect to a gaming PC, so you can play SteamVR games, which usually have better graphics than the standalone oculus store games.

Feels like you're at a imax movie theater with it on. Would be bery good for watching movies and tv shows.

FPS games have free range of movements (can hold a gun, throw a grenade however you want)


Cons: Original headset battery life lasts 2 - 3 hours. (Buying a Elite battery strap will fix this or a long usb-c charging cord)

Considering we don't currently have a gaming PC, this was the best option out there for us, and it allows us to play with/against my brother and his family on various games. We've been enjoying it so much, I'm considering getting my own. The only downside right now is that not all of the apps are currently App-Sharing, so with games like Beat Saber, I'm going to have to purchase my own copy of the game plus all the add-on songs we already bought under my husband's account, so I can have my own scores. It does have a short battery life (about 2 hours) but we attached a mobile power bank to the oculus and stuck it in a back pocket for extra play time, and that worked.

Another thing that was surprising was the stock audio is also much improved over the original, so much that I don’t even feel the need to use headphones.

It's very immersive and you use your whole body to interact with the environment instead of just moving your fingers.   I like the safety feature where it allows you set boundary (virtual wall) so that it can track your position and warn you when you cross that boundary line.  I don't exercise much but this vr has been making me want to work out.  There are a few features that I didn't really like about this vr.  First, the head strap isn't really comfortable.  Second, spongy face cover didn't really work out for me well especially when I sweat.  Third, if you wear eye glasses it might not fit you well.

It's so well done that it's easy to ""get lost"" in the game you're playing and feel like it's real.  There are a significant amount of games available for all ages and lots of learning as well.  

The only Con I could come up with is that it does run out of battery and you have to put it away for a while.  

I believe it also needs to be tied to a Facebook account to purchase games.  The charges come through as Facebook charges.  So if you're against Facebook, this might not be the VR for you.  Other than that...it is great.  Even works with Youtube and Netflix!  It's also a great workout when you use games like Beat Saber.

One very good Pro is that you build a virtual wall and floor so it will alert you with gridlines as you play so you don't fall or trip over anything.",2022-05-18 18:19:00.701498,5,5

2022-05-18 18:19:01.599594,"My advice: if you’re buying for kids, just make sure you have them research the system, and get them to list some games that they’ve either got to try or watched properly what the gameplay is like. If they can name enough games and explain the gameplay - get it. It’s worth the extra if you or your kids frequently play multiple games, and it’s worth it to get the oculus quest opposed to other options because it’s wire free. VR is truly getting sufficiently advanced to justify spending a little more to get the most uninhibited experience. Like I said though, make sure if it’s for kids they really understand the gameplay of the games they’re excited for, reminds me a bit of NES or SNES days - the fun artwork and hype around a game might not be what you’re expecting. Worth it if you know what you’re getting and enjoy that, just make sure your kid understands they aren’t yet entering the Oasis. :)",2022-05-18 18:19:01.599594,5,5

YOU CAND USE IT UNLESS YOU HAVE A FACEBOOK ACCOUNT.
It has cameras  ,  a microphone , and WIFI.
Facebook collects as much data about you to sell to anyone and use it to change you habits.

The mic will pickup every sound you and around you and facebook will you that and sell that data.

The camera will capture and everything it see , faces , finger prints , bills you left out ,how messy you house is, your kids faces , if your window is open cars outside etc. collect that data and sell it.

etc. etc. etc.  this is will its really good and cheaper then most , the data it will collect will be far greater the what they are selling it for.

Using on pc doesn't seem to work as it should.

After doing that, I'm now getting many unwanted request for ""friends"" request on Facebook. You have to install the Oculus software on your phone to be able to setup the Oculus Quest 2 so that must be the vector for all the notifications from Facebook that are trying to get me to participate on Facebook. I decided long ago that I would leave Facebook, but now I'm back on their platform. Not happy about that. I would have given 5 stars except for the Facebook account requirement.

I've used it for games that come on the Quest 2 store, and for games that also come on the Oculus Store (some rift games) and on Steam, all through the link cable that's sold separately. The graphics have been pretty decent, and the options were decent for adjusting the eyepieces to avoid blurring. My 14 year-old son has gotten a pretty good cardio workout from some of the dance and sport games. What's even more fun is you can cast the image from the game onto a TV via Chromecast, so the whole family can be part of the experience. The only thing I've needed to work around has been getting my glasses on with the headset, but it comes with a spacer to help with that process.

The games you can download that is native to this headset are super fun.. I played Onward (FPS/COD type game) mostly, and a few of the social games like Rec Room.... but things changed after a few weeks of use.  I learned I could connect to my VR capable gaming PC and have another ***WORLD*** of VR games to experience.  Currently I've got over 100 hours of gameplay logged on Phasmaphobia. 

Enough of what I've been playing... Do yourself a favor, and get one of these.  You won't be disappointed!",2022-05-18 18:19:04.074939,5,5

2022-05-18 18:19:04.241979,"I had an Oculus Rift which requires you to be tethered to a computer with a long USB cord.  The great thing about the Quest is I don't need the computer and  can take it anywhere and not have to worry about cords.  I don't see any reduction to the graphics quality, controller tracking, and headset weight compared to the Rift.  

The only issues I have is the stock head strap is essentially an elastic band that wraps around your head.  It did not feel stable if I needed to turn or tilt my head and would slip loose.  When I tried to tighten it, the pressure on my head is not comfortable.  I would recommend getting the Elite Strap.  

Another thing to note is if you had an Oculus Rift and switch to the Quest, know that you may have to re-buy some games that you already have on the Rift.  You can check Oculus website to see which games have Cross Buy.  If a game has it, then it will be available on Quest without having to re-purchase.",2022-05-18 18:19:04.241979,4,4

Afraid it was a fad (3D TV's *cough) and the wow factor would wear off in a week and the unit would just sit in the corner collecting dust. I'm glad I jumped off that fence and got a Quest 2. 
The reason I chose the Quest is it's ability to be a stand alone unit yet, works perfectly fine with a USB-C 3.0 or higher cable (or if you're lucky enough to have good enough internet, you can use Virtual Desktop, to ditch the cable and run PCVR wirelessly.) You do need to have a some what decent computer. I'm currently running it with a relatively new gaming laptop and it runs decently.
If you were like me, do yourself a favour and just buy it already. Take the plunge and see you in the Oasis!

The new Oculus Touch controllers feel great and I have yet to lose any tracking and everything flows. There is also the Guardian System that you set up by drawing your boundaries your play area and will come on if you start to get near those boundaries. And since a lot of Oculus titles are cross-buy, meaning if you have an Oculus Rift/Rift S, you can play those titles directly from the Quest 2.

I'm sure side by side one can tell the difference, but pop on the Quest 2, jump into the world of VR and totally enjoy your experience. The wireless freedom is amazing no more tripping over cords.

Visual fidelity won't be as high since it's a standalone device but it still has a very high resolution display. And if you have a powerful enough PC, you can always hook it up to that for more games/better visuals.

So far my experience with it, the ""downgrade"" in visuals hasn't been noticeable. Walking Dead is fun af. Beat Saber and Superhot look just as I remember on PC.

The biggest downside so far is the fit. I wear glasses and have bushy/thick hair so it's hard to get the headset on easily with my glasses and I usually have to go without glasses.

Another downside is a smaller library of games. Using it as a PC headset, you'll have access to a larger amount of officially released games, even on the official Oculus storefront. As a standalone device their are far fewer games available to you.",2022-05-18 18:19:04.995004,5,5

For the price you can't beat this thing to get into VR. The sound is very amazing considering you don't have actual head sets on. It is very immersive and real feel experience.

A couple of small critiques but nothing that would stop me from recommending.

1. The battery life isn't that great but you can resolve that by plugging in an external battery pack.
2. On the hand controllers, I keep pushing the button that pauses the game. I'm sure there may be a way to adjust that in the settings but I haven't figured that out yet.
3. I did try and connect my Sony blue tooth headset and although it did work, it slowed down the gaming experience and made things jittery. But you can hook up the headset to a audio jack on the Quest 2 and headphones so that is a work around.

So I will give a huge thumbs up to this!",2022-05-18 18:19:05.761380,5,5

Pros:

It’s so much better then the previous versions. We can play some really cool games present on the oculus store but I hope it just get better from here.

Cons:
Playing for more then 40 mins becomes a little uncomfortable
The graphics needs improvement 
Sometime the oculus freezes sometimes",2022-05-18 18:19:07.016470,4,4

I only gave ot a 4 because white is a silly color to have made it. The games make you sweat so otbstains pretty quick.

Played capture the flag in the free Rec Room app and felt like I was 13 years old playing laser tag again.  Its really  like have the world at your fingertips, which is really incredible and difficult to describe. It has great resolution and absolutely stunning visuals and its a great price.
The head strap isn't very comfortable but so I've ordered a replacement.
The Facebook account isn't a big deal to me, already had an one, which I barley used. If you actually read the oculus privacy policy they only collect general user data and they only do it to improve the experience in the future.
Would recommend creating an oculus account with facebook, or merging your 2 accounts before buying because I've heard some have had issues, but Im sure they'll fix them soon.  And the library is great and expanding plus tons of free content.

My only complaints of the headset itself are the relatively low resolution of the lenses and the restricted field of view.  It never really has that ""Fully Immersed"" feel of some other headsets.  However, it runs flawlessly.  Seriously, even though we push (and even break) the limits of what the software can do, we never have any complaints with the headset hardware itself.  

Another negative to keep in mind.  If you aren't familiar with VR setup and navigation, trying to work with Facebook's Landings/home room can be...frustrating (and that's being nice).  Poorly designed by committee is the best description I can think of.

What an experience!  So I absolutely had to get the Oculus Quest 2.  I’ve been playing video games since PONG was considered cutting-edge, and I’ve played almost all of the the consoles from then to now and while the games get shinier and shinier, it’s been the same experience, sitting in front of the t.v. with a controller mashing away.  I’ve been wanting more from gaming for years and the OQ2 gives me what I’ve been wanting.  Playing in the games with the OQ2, (and I do mean IN, you are IN the games, or should I say immersed), gets you off the couch and moving and it’s so much fun.  The graphics are terrific and the experience is beyond any gaming on any console. No wires needed!  

I highly recommend upgrading from the stock head-strap to the HTC Deluxe Audio Strap.  The DAS increases comfort and adds built-in headphones.",2022-05-18 18:19:11.165283,5,5

I've been waiting to buy into the Oculus world for a couple years because I didn't think it was quite mature enough.  However, with the Quest 2, I felt the time had come.  I will never get into the high end action games that are being introduced for the VR world, but even the simple, free media that comes bundled with the headset is cool.  iMax theaters will no longer be needed with the filming that is being adapted to the VR headset world

Just make sure you have decent internet service as the file downloads are large.  20mbps download speeds are what I consider a minimum as the files are quite large.  However, once you get the downloads completed and they then reside on the headset, it's no longer a concern.

You're even able to link it up to your PC to play games from there (with some setup). But this headset offers the convivence of straight out of the box and play feeling. There are no wires or cables needed while playing, only when you need to charge it.

Some of my only concerns with this is that you do need a bit of setting up if you would like to play Steam games on here, more so if you plan to do it wirelessly and stream them to the headset. You need to purchase another application to do so.

You do also need a Facebook account to buy and play games from the store, since Oculus is owned by Facebook. I created a separate account just to use the Oculus for, so you can do that if you'd like.

Until now.  Let me say, this device really blew my mind!  The Ease of use made it fun from the start.  And the virtual environment..breathtaking!  It really is an experience that’s better experienced than explained.  I watched an animated roller coaster and let me tell you, even if you’ve never been on a roller coaster before, the ability to look all around you, below you, the immersion itself will make you feel like you’re in the coaster seat!  It does this so well, you’ll feel the anxiety and thrills of the ride.  If your on the fence about getting one, I urge you to try it out.  The worlds and environments are so beautiful and real, and you go anywhere.

You can upload your videos and pictures to the Oculus Quest 2, however it doesn't turn them into 3D versions, but it does show them on a large screen.  You can access your Facebook account and there are lots of 3D Youtube videos that are very realistic.

1)  The video quality sharper
2)  The motion is smoother
3)  The headset is indeed lighter

Using the Oculus Quest 2 for wireless VR experiences is simply fantastic.  However there are a few things that annoyed me:

1)  The all-white surfaces show the dirtiness faster
2)  The controllers feel like the grips are slightly smaller
3)  I'm not a fan of the new head strap.  I opted for a 3rd party adjustable head strap system and the headset is now much more comfortable.

The biggest disappointment with the OQ2 is the dark levels.  It's not something that's really noticeable in bright games and experiences, but if you use the OQ2 to watch videos and movies in a VR theater, etc., you're going to notice it.  It's actually pretty bad in my opinion - and there doesn't appear to be much you can do to mitigate the problem.

Beat Saber is tons of fun to play with your friends and family. We started out with one headset, and that quickly turned into 5 headsets so that we could all play together. There is a fun MMO game too called Zenith that I've been enjoying as well. 

The biggest downsides are that:

1. a facebook account is required. I suggest making a dummy account so that they can't leach all your personal information to sell. 

2. In game purchases due add up if you want to get the full experience on some of the games (I'm looking at you beat saber) 

One thing to note, that isn't necessarily a downside, is that the battery life taps out between the 2.5 - 3 hour mark. Which, is honestly pretty impressive for a computer you're essentially wearing on your face. To remedy this, we bought 15ft USB-C cables to plug in while we play.

I debated for a very long time, whether or not to buy an Oculus since I had a VR gaming system already. When I thought it through logically, PSVR is a gaming experience, the Oculus Quest is a total VR experience! You can enjoy and do everything with it that you could possibly imagine. The only problem I have with it is the fact that my youngest stepdaughter isn’t able to use it comfortably. Sadly she is 8 years old and her head is too small for the headset itself. If they were to sell some sort of attachment or adapter to compensate for that fact, I would happily buy it and there would be absolutely NO NEGATIVITY with this at all. I would highly recommend anyone who is considering buying this, bite the bullet and go for it. You will not be sorry. I do have to say, the major pro in favor of the PSVR is there is a larger game library than there is for the Oculus.

We have to set an alarm clock so we don’t spend too much time on it. It is very immersive. This particular one needs no computer, everything is built-in. The only big drawback to it in all seriousness is the expense of the games and apps. The machine was $400 itself and came with no games or apps to speak of. There are some free stuff that you can get. A fishing game that’s a lot of fun and variousOther things but if you want to get any decent games look at forking out at least 20 bucks per game. Our favorite so far as a zombie game where we can team up and just blast zombies for hours.
I would highly recommend this to anybody. We are 53 years old and we have a ton of fun. I know it’s not just the games. You can go traveling without ever leaving your house. You can immerse yourself in oceans or deserts or jungles.

By reasonable, I mean don't expect PS4 graphics on a 4k screen for resolution.  Graphics wise, it displays like an early 2010 home console.  Graphics are good enough, it's the world this puts you in, it's the fact you don't have to cable it up to a high end PC, the ease of setting up boundaries so you don't hurt yourself while immersed in the game, the controls that feel so natural, the very reasonable cost, and the game library (If you don't purchase Walking dead, you're really missing out).  I have one complaint about this device, and it's an obvious one... The included head strap is so uncomfortable that I can't use it more than 10 minutes.  I'm not deducting a star because I feel this was such a great deal for what it offers you.  I'd rather have paid $50-$100 more and had a really comfortable head strap.

If you plan to use this as a standalone experience like I have so far, I recommend the 256GB model. The only complaints I have is that you NEED a facebook account to set this up, and dummy/tossaway accounts will brick the headset. For someone like me whose had a Facebook account for a while, this wasn't much a big deal for me, since i rarely use FB nowadays. I also recommend getting the elite strap. The headstrap that comes with the headset is garbage. Without the elite strap, It is uncomfortable.

2022-05-18 18:19:22.296203,"I loved the Quest 1 but the Quest 2 already has a number of issues:
1 - The Android app doesn't allow you to pair the headset, even after updating it.  You have to clear the app cache in order for the Quest 2 to appear (nothing tells you this unless you do a Google search and find other who have had the same issue).
2 - The left controller does not appear in VR even though it is paired and connected, and the battery level registers as 100%. (I have gone through all of the troubleshooting steps, but still no controller.)
3 - The audio sounds tinny, like there is no bass at all.
4 - Anything that should look black actually looks dark grey, apparently because they're using a cheaper form of display.
5 - Even the elite headstrap doesn't feel as secure as the Quest 1 basic headstrap.
6 - Anything white, like text, appears to have a streak of light coming off of it unless your viewing angle is perfect.

If you are happy with the Quest 1, you might want to stick with it for now.  It seems like there are a lot of issues to work out with the Quest 2.",2022-05-18 18:19:22.296203,1,1

2022-05-18 18:19:24.224008,"Coming from the Oculus Rift S, I had high hopes for the Quest 2 since Oculus had discontinued the Rift S and the higher end segment of VR. I had done some research as I wanted to make sure the Quest 2 was able to run most of the apps I had already purchased for the Rift S.

Unfortunately support for those apps I discovered later required the side-loading of apps via developers loop hole. I still could not get Google Earth VR to run even though I invested in the $75 cable to connect the Quest 2 to my recently purchased (from Best Buy) Alienware Gaming Laptop. Sadly, I learned Google had discontinued support for VR 3 years ago.

Other apps I had would also not be supported such as Alyx.  Alyx was one of the best graphical apps/games I have but even though I was running it off my laptop I used with the Rift S the Oculus system would still not allow the apps to run on the Quest 2.

So for lighter graphics games like arcade and lower graphics the Quest 2 worked fine and the lack of cables and the need to plus in to a computer would make it fun for play.",2022-05-18 18:19:24.224008,3,3

We have a few more years till we hit the PC graphics era.  Is it cool, yes I think it is.  The boxing is fun: Thrill of the fight, Gorn is fun, Star Wars games were great, but all cartoony like Nintendo. But a good work out and getting people off the couch is a good thing!  Easy to get sick if you are walking around in the game, but games have ways around moving and not bothering you so much.  The lens also has a blur, you can download SideQuest and easily tweak that a bit, but still has a blur. The field of view I wish was a little more wider, can see the edges slightly on the sides.  Oculus keeps updating with surprises like 90hz and then 120hz.  They also are finally doing PCVR with native Air Link that allows you to play games powered by your PC wirelessly and get access to Oculus Rift games.  Still the graphics are not as good as a PC.

Customer support is being notoriously strict about using the warranty. I had to actually send in a video demonstrating the issue and despite clearly showing it, they are continuing to make me re-do troubleshooting steps that I already performed. I have never had any other company do this to me before when resolving an issue with a faulty product. It is obvious that at least one batch of these headsets had a manufacturing issue, and they want to blame everyone but themselves. I now have a lowered trust in Facebook and how they do business, and I now actively avoid their products. I was skeptical ever since they deleted the account of the guy who broke his neck playing VR.

2022-05-18 18:19:28.466557,"I mean let's face it.. regular reality has pretty much sucked for the past two years.  So why drudge through the day-to-day slog of real life when for a few hundred bucks and some disapproving looks from your family, you can escape to a reality that is virtually your own?

Sure, this reality may seem like you're looking at the world through a screen door attached to horse blinders, but isnt that a small price to pay to eliminate all that pesky personal exposure to coughy, sneezy people?  And the fact that you are untethered to an electronic anchor allows you the freedom of movement that will have you feeling like you are *actually* running through fields of flowers and dispatching zombies with your bare hands.

Unlike reality reality, you will find yourself unburdened by a breadth of options and choices of things to do.  Much like an episode of the Kardashians, the content doesn't run deep.  But again, you get to live in the shallow pool of your own design and that can't all be bad.

1. Haven’t used the cable, there has been enough memory for what I use. 
2. This will most likely make you motion sick. It does me on a lot of the games, but you get use to it with time. It’s one reason I don’t play it as much as I first intended. 
3. The feature to cast can be tricky. I could get it to cast to my phone (IPhone) but not my TV (Samsung). 
4. The head strap is a bit uncomfortable so I got the upgraded version at $50. 
5. The pupil distance feature requires you to move the lenses by reaching inside the Oculus. Would be nice if it had a dial that you could adjust. Only has 3 settings but should allow you to fine tune. 
Overall if you have the money to spend on upgrades and you plan to use frequently then I would recommend. Upgrades are all pretty expensive. So far I’ve spent almost $200 on the cable, head strap and case for it.",2022-05-18 18:19:29.510082,5,5

2022-05-18 18:19:33.487708,Great product! Extreamly Fun! Not good for anyone who get motion sickness. The only problem i had with it was battery life but does charge pretty fast. Will look forward to buying a portable battery for this.,2022-05-18 18:19:33.487708,5,5
2022-05-18 18:19:33.517704,"Overall easy to use, fun to play and super addictive. Only thing I would say is the 256gb, for my 2 sons at least, is way more than enough space. I could’ve saved some money by purchasing the smaller HD size.",2022-05-18 18:19:33.517704,5,5

2022-05-18 18:19:33.764819,Love it the only issues I have is the battery life and the foam around the glasses. It also makes you use your Facebook account which is understandable since it's owned by Facebook but wish you didn't have to,2022-05-18 18:19:33.764819,4,4
2022-05-18 18:19:33.793742,The oculus quest is awesome. The hands free nature and price are awesome for a quality car experience. While a gaming pc and link cable are needed for large gaming experiences this keeps the option available.,2022-05-18 18:19:33.793742,5,5

2022-05-18 18:19:34.283274,"Great product, reasonably priced. It just sucks that they include a crappy strap with the original purchase instead of the improved strap which of course they charge an extra $50 for as an add on accessory.",2022-05-18 18:19:34.283274,4,4

2022-05-18 18:19:34.558845,Accessories are disappointing. Best part is sideload apps and stream wireless from real PC or Does a great job on its own from the get go. Competes on overall scale with wired VR with headsets 2x this cost.,2022-05-18 18:19:34.558845,4,4

2022-05-18 18:19:36.718099,You’ll want to get the 256 GB if you are planning on having a few games on the Oculus. Realistic virtual reality and great family fun. You can stream and watch what others are doing to be more involved.,2022-05-18 18:19:36.718099,5,5
2022-05-18 18:19:36.748094,"I am not a huge gamer, but I must say the Oculus Quest 2 VR rig is the most immersive gaming experience I have ever had. Pistol Whip is the best first-person shooter I have ever played, and I have not played that many. Eleven table tennis feels just like playing real ping pong. The free app to explore the International Space Station can induce vertigo and motion sickness. The Thrill of the Fight is a brilliant boxing game and a real cardio workout. You can connect the Oculus to your gaming PC with a cable (purchased separately), but I have only used it as a standalone system. You download the games directly to the Oculus using wi-fi. The setup could not be simpler. No wires. Just you, the Oculus headset and two hand controllers. All for less than the cost of the Xbox or PS5. I am honestly blown away by this system. It is accessible, intuitive, so there is not a steep learning curve, and fun. Heck you can even watch Netflix in a much nicer VR house that any of us could afford. If you are bored, have a few hundred bucks burning a hole in your wallet, this could be the therapy for you.",2022-05-18 18:19:36.748094,5,5

2022-05-18 18:19:36.883071,My favorite part of 2020.  I love playing it when I can get it away from my 7yr old.  And so far most of the games are fairly priced. 2 friends have already purchased them after playing mine just once.,2022-05-18 18:19:36.883071,5,5

2022-05-18 18:19:41.151958,I bought this because they said it was sharper and more balanced than the first Quest and it is.  All of my games transferred to the Quest 2 with no problems.  Its lighter and more comfortable.,2022-05-18 18:19:41.151958,5,5

2022-05-18 18:19:41.240254,"Lots of fun and educational! My teenage boys like the games. Hubby & I enjoy exploring immersive videos and locations. You can hook it up to a Windows pc with a cable to access apps & games available for the oculus rift but the cable is $75 in store and a bit confusing to choose the correct cable type on Amazon. $75 is too much in my opinion for the cable and we’ve been pleased with what we can use on the Quest 2 store. We’ve also heard you can use an app called Virtual Desktop to access the Steam library but we haven’t tried it yet. For first timers, stick with apps rated “Comfortable” when starting out, otherwise you’ll get queasy. The headset can get heavy, but by the time you notice that, it’s time to take a break anyways. It does get dirty, showing a dinginess on the white straps and if your kid’s sweaty friends use it, you’ll wanna wipe it down and figure out how to clean the face shield. I’m hoping for an improved face shield cuz that was gross. A gentle wipe down took care of that for now. Overall, it was a great family activity for the family over the holidays and we like it a lot.",2022-05-18 18:19:41.240254,5,5

2022-05-18 18:19:43.203822,Awesome gaming! It’s a totally immersive experience but if you get dizzy easily then this is probably not the best thing for you. Get the travel case for this also. You’re going to need it.,2022-05-18 18:19:43.203822,5,5

2022-05-18 18:19:43.602116,This thing is fun as heck.  I did have to buy the link cable on line to access Quill and Medium but that was AOK.  Having no cables while working up a bit of a sweat in Beat Saber is great.,2022-05-18 18:19:43.602116,5,5

2022-05-18 18:19:43.693871,I love this thing. Battery is a little on the short side when you play non stop and cast to your tv. Still very worth it. Recommend purchasing the elite strap with battery as a work around.,2022-05-18 18:19:43.693871,5,5

2022-05-18 18:19:44.411894,Extremely fun to play with. You will definitely lose track of time when you're wearing this. I have to say that the Star Wars games are what got me hooked and keep my playing quite a while,2022-05-18 18:19:44.411894,5,5

I really like it, and it is truly immersive.  My only complaint (and why the lack of 5 stars) being that there is very little content.  I was really hoping that it had been enough years for more games to be playable on it...and instead I felt like I bought a Windows Phone.  It is BEAUTIFUL, and it works GREAT...but you can't do much other than stare at it.  Some people complain about having to use your Facebook account on it, but you can select to keep your information private and not announce that you own it, so what is the concern that is different than having any other Console login?  The inclusion of Documentaries and such is interesting, but if I wanted that, I would fire up my 3D glasses for my TV and get as immersive as I want and be able to have my Family next to me able to enjoy it.  It just seems silly to me to have a platform like this, and then have a severely limited supply of content that isn't a game or social networking.",2022-05-18 18:19:47.635976,4,4

This device reminds our family of our Vegas trip and we were @ Caesars' Palace. We rode the Race To Atlantis.   Fun and safe for the entire family. Emerging yourself into the actual environments is way to real. Once you learn how work the controls you'll never tire of playing. You can also play against others in your contact list if you so choose to allow. Grand kids love it, There are some free games pre loaded, but you are able to try before you buy others, Games are bought through Oculus, not iTunes store. Game storage case is sold separately. Initially you have to have a Facebook Account and then download Oculus App. Oculus will not work without FB account. I recommend this for everyone. It's addictive and if you're home alone, please play SIT DOWN GAMES ONLY because you can injury oneself if playing standing games. There EXTREMELY REAL LIKE.

2022-05-18 18:20:05.400724,"Upgraded from 2 Gear VR to Quest 2. What a difference, I didn't have to  deal with the overheating issue of the galaxy series  and  pain of  sticking the phone in and out of the headset. Don't get me wrong, the Quest 2 is not perfect but it is 100% improvement from any VR headset out there and that is including the original Quest 1 that i was trying to purchase but it  was out of stock. The IPD is a bit on the hard side to  get the best match to the viewing eyes. Sound is little weak but if u would like to deal with wires  around your neck or anywhere around  the side of your face, then  the sound can be improve. Battery is not the best by getting about 40 or so minutes of run time. But since it is not healthy to be staring through all the 3D effect, then it is a good excuse for the headset to  be taken off and put on charge when the battery is low before it completely shut down because of no power.

When I received the Quest 2, it requires you to consolidate with your Facebook account.  I did so, having an active Facebook account for 10+ years.  However, after doing so their Oculus store would no longer accept any of my payment methods(I've got plenty of valid options).  It will not let me add any payment options, giving an error message that payment methods cannot be added at this time. I started a case with their customer service team 11 days ago, and nothing has been done.  I ask for an update regularly, and receive no response.  So I haven't been able to order a single game for my Quest 2.  Oculus is never going to resolve the issue, their customer service just offers a refund.  I don't want a refund, I want the issue resolved, as now I can't even buy games for my Quest 1 or Rift.  I've seen numerous people complaining about having the same exact issue in Oculus forums.  Oculus just advises them to open a ticket, but have not resolved the issue for anyone.  Worst customer service ever.",2022-05-18 18:20:21.507456,1,1

2022-05-18 18:20:32.596700,"The Oculus Quest 2 is an amazing headset, whether it's for standalone use or tethered to a PC. The price is more affordable than ever and it's simply better than the Quest 1 in every way, except for one. The unit itself is lighter, more comfortable and faster than the Quest 1, but the screen has taken two steps forward and one step back. 

It's a higher resolution panel with greater pixel density, which allows for crisper images and helps reduce the screen door effect. It also supports higher refresh rates, providing a smoother experience. However, while the Quest 1 had OLED panels, capable of rich darks, the Quest 2 switched to standard LED panels which can't get nearly as dark. This leads to dark scenes in games and content being more of an ugly grey. While this isn't a big issue for most games with bright, colorful scenery, it completely kills immersion for dark games such as the Vader Immortal series and other Horror themed titles.

Overall, it's a much better product compared to the Quest 1, but it's *almost* a deal breaker that the screens are no longer OLED. Luckily, the improved resolution and faster refresh rate make it a worthwhile tradeoff.",2022-05-18 18:20:32.596700,4,4

2022-05-18 18:20:40.083267,"This has become an essential product for me, I use it more than my game console sometimes, and often as much as my projector.

The browser works very well with online subscriptions, and having that extra space is worth it for your downloadable content.

It also has a lot of fun apps and games, and many entertaining video services too.

I have been using VR technology since 2015, and it has never been this convinient, you don't have to worry about being trapped, and you still get the best available resolution, plus having both controllers from the start allows you to take advantage of all the features from the start.

It is also completely responsive and functional, you never have to worry about that because the sensors work well. You can walk around with it and get closer, unlike Gear VR where you are stuck with the same perspective.

The only downside is that it doesn't work well when you use bluetooth, but they probably can solve that in the future.

I recommend having rechargeable batteries for the controllers, and the headset battery lasts 2 hours, so it is a good time, but an extra long cable us recommend to recharge if you need more time to enjoy it.",2022-05-18 18:20:40.083267,5,5

This headset is great for both the beginner to VR up to the veteran VR gamers. Whether you're looking for casual fun, active gaming, or fitness that's way more fun than running a treadmill, Oculus and the Oculus Store is an excellent choice. The technology is more advanced than I even realized. I play in multiple parts of my house and it remembers my outlined playing area each time. The 4 cameras that track your position do an outstanding job in various lighting conditions (do not use outside in sun) and make it easy to quickly access passthrough to view your surroundings without removing the headset. The touch controls and even hand tracking make your experiences so immersive.read the instructions on how to best adjust the lenses, including using the spacer if you wear glasses. There is no difference in the 64GB and 256GB other than storage capacity. 64GB gets youaybe 20 games, which you can always uninstall to free up space. I opted for 256GB to never worry about it and also have tto for recording my experiences.

2022-05-18 18:21:01.700660,"I owned a Quest 1 until my ex stole it.... So I was happy when this one came out. There are some pros and cons here. 

It's definitely lighter on your face than the first one. It's also a LOT more painful. The straps that come with it are a complete joke. They have plastic pieces that will dig into back of your head. 

Another con is that they removed the piece on bottom that left you change eye width. Instead now, you have to physically reach in and move the eye pieces manually which is both stupid and causes fingerprints. I need it on to see if things are clear. You can't do that now. 

Another con is the wristbands on the controllers. The bands are cheap and thin, unlike the old quest. Sound is also not as good on this one.... Definitely will require ear buds if you are hard of hearing..

Screen door is gone now! This does improve on the screen door effect. Picture is clearer and it seems faster in general.

So while they beefed up what's inside, they went cheap and chintzy on comfort and function . You also now have to have a Facebook account or you can't play.

With tech support i managed to get that fixed but it took me several hours. Hours. Then the hand sets were non-responsive. i could not figure out how to get them to work. After a couple more hours fussing with them, i had to go back to tech support and learn how to factory reset the controllers. This was an insane amount of work to undertake for something brand new and never used. The instructions are insufficient. They assume everything goes flawlessly and have scant info in them. Useless. i was further annoyed to note that the unit was only manufactured two months prior. Seems to be _ poor quality control at The factory. After getting it fixed finally i was able to try it out. i have to say it's pretty cool once it works. Lastly, the head band is very poorly designed. It's annoying if you plan to allow multiple people to take turns using it, _ forget about it!! The strap is a pain to adjust for each user. It's really designed to set and forget.

2022-05-18 18:21:30.692543,"There have only been a few times in my lifelong love of all things tech that I have been amazed by a product.  I was fascinated with the first digital calculator I saw (apparently I'm old), awe struck with the first colour computer, and loved my first smart phone.  Using the Quest 2 was one of the times where I was truly blown away.

I was predisposed to expect a Facebook (Meta) hardware product to be clunky, navigationally challenged and limited in function.  The Oculus Quest 2 is none of these things and an absolute must have for my family.  

The image quality greatly exceeded my expectations.  The audio volume and quality are very good.  The best part of the experience is how smooth everything works together.   The battery is giving two hours of operational time.  It seems to recharge quite quickly although I haven't timed it.  There are quite a few free apps to get started with.  I can many possibilities for rapid expansion of the app offerings.

I would highly recommend this product.

To Facebook: Do whatever it takes to keep the leadership of this product team in place.  They did everything well!  I'm pleasantly surprised and grateful that you delivered such a great product!",2022-05-18 18:21:30.692543,5,5

2022-05-18 18:21:34.781916,"Great VR headset, the only real downside to it is battery life. You should already know if you're looking at the Quest that you are trading mobile, PC-free convenience for a hit in performance. That being said this things still performs quite well, especially since most VR games are very simple in terms of graphics and texture. If you've ever played VR games before you are probably already aware of that. To me, the ability to take this thing anywhere and use it wire free (not to mention share that experience with others) far outweighs being able to run a select few titles that require the horsepower of a PC. The one major downside to this device is that the battery life sucks. On a full charge the HMD gets about 2 hours of battery life before it needs to be plugged in. The controllers last a  good bit longer so they aren't as much of a concern. The good news is you can buy a battery extension pack or plug in to a battery charger (mobile pack or plugged into the wall) while you are playing so you aren't completely limited to 2 hours.

I've found I typically don't play more than an hour or two at a time anyways, but it is somewhat bothersome having to charge it after every single use.",2022-05-18 18:21:34.781916,4,4

2022-05-18 18:21:37.004858,"Overall a decent product.  Well made, controllers work, with a very little learning curve.  Most people take to it quickly when I put them in their hands.  I've only purchased a few games so far, but I carefully vetted what I purchased, so I am very happy with them.  Some games only play standing up,  some sitting,  some both. 
 There's a lot that I wouldn't use much, so do your research before wasting money on games.  
As for motion sickness, this is far better than my Playstation VR, almost non existent.  I said almost, not without.  They do a good job of adding anti naseau settings in the headset, and in the media you purchase, which honestly I haven't had to use.  So they took measures to address that.  
Battery is well over an hour, close to the 2 hr mark I would think, and that is MORE than enough.  Honestly I'm only good for around an hour.  I need a break then.  This is still not nearly as easy as playing a standard game watching a TV.  Don't mistake it, you will need a break every hour.  I'm 56, and youth definitely has an advantage here.  
If your ok with what you just read from me,  stop contemplating and go pick it up.  I'm sure you'll find some interesting media to play.",2022-05-18 18:21:37.004858,4,4

2022-05-18 18:21:44.502547,"Using this headset requires that you have and maintain a Facebook account. If you get banned from Facebook, even for reasons beyond your control or knowledge, or cancel your account then this headset will not work, and you loose any game purchases you have made in the Oculus store. 

If that sounds too crazy for you to believe me about, then do a little Google searching and find out for yourself. 

If you don't use your real name, Facebook will likely ban you for life - making this headset an expensive paperweight. If you are under 13, you are not supposed to have a Facebook account - so technically you should not be buying this for young children.

Facebook does this so they can collect data on you and be sure it is you they are compiling the data about. This headset has external cameras and maps your playspace - it is uncertain, but Facebook may have access to those maps of the interior of your house. Facebook will track what games you play, how long you play them and even what you are looking at in the game.

If you are OK with that, then by all means go get this headset, it is an excellent VR headset. Well worth 5 stars otherwise -- you just need to know what you are signing up for.",2022-05-18 18:21:44.502547,1,1

2022-05-18 18:22:09.791157,"I've always been a gamer since as far back as hanging out in arcades. I bought this on a whim because I wanted to gauge the state of VR gaming for myself. I've had the headset for 2 weeks and I honestly don't want to go back to traditional gaming. The immersion, the fun, the variety of things you can do in VR aside from gaming, is just astounding. As far as buying a Oculus Quest 2 versus another brand, that is your call. A lot of controversy over Facebook being a requirement but for a lot of us it isn't a big deal - we already have Facebook accounts and we don't use them in a malicious way so there's no worry about getting our account banned. But if you're the type of person that feels the need to comment on all the drama you come across on Facebook, putting your account in jeopardy, then maybe you should pick another headset. For the rest of us the Quest 2 is a wonderful device for everything from children to the elderly. I would however, recommend buying the Elite Strap or some other solution for a strap, as the included strap, while suitable, isn't very comfortable and you'll want to upgrade before long. I bought the non-battery Elite Strap with mine and haven't had any issues at all with it.",2022-05-18 18:22:09.791157,5,5

2022-05-18 18:22:22.848671,"I had very low expectations going into this after using my cousin’s Valve Index, but I’m happy to say that I was thoroughly impressed and feel absolutely no buyer’s remorse. There’s something to be said about the sense of freedom and comfort this headset offers with its completely wireless approach, and the only noticeable difference in the screen performance compared to the Index is the field of view and lack of very fine tuning adjustments. The only real comparison where this falls short, in my opinion, is with the controllers. Valve absolutely nailed the design of their controllers and the experience is far more natural when compared to the Quest. It is also 3x the cost though, and the experience the Quest offers is still fantastic so take that comparison with a grain of salt. I’d confidently say this is the best option for the money for both beginners and avid gamers though. One thing I will add, if you intend to use this with a PC, go for the 64gb option and get the Oculus Link Cable with it. The only viable reason I can think of to get the 256gb version is if you intend to use this on the go and want to save a large amount of movies and songs onto it in conjunction with the oculus games have.",2022-05-18 18:22:22.848671,5,5

2022-05-18 18:25:36.137980,"Love the Oculus Quest 2. I bought 3 of these as Christmas gifts for my kids.  They have turned into entertainment for the whole family.  These things aren't perfect but I think they are pretty amazing and a good starting point for VR. 

Pros: 
Easy and fairly intuitive to use and setup if you have even minimal technical ability

Lots of entertainment options for the whole family from shooters to puzzles to exercise

Really fun to play games, socially interact, or watch media

Cons: 

Some people will be sensitive to the movement and may get motion sickness. My wife and youngest get sick pretty easily, the rest of us have no issue. Plus side is that many games give a comfort rating.

Battery life is not great. I typically get 1 to 1.5 hours on a single charge. There a battery packs available to extend battery life. 

Facebook account required - maybe a con if your not on Facebook or don't want to be. 

Multiple accounts - if you buy multiple Quests for use with friends and family do a little research into best way to setup game sharing before you setup. 

May not want to leave younger aged kids unattended to play.  As with any platform where people can freely socialize and interact there is going to be some amount of inappropriate conduct.",2022-05-18 18:25:36.137980,5,5
2022-05-18 18:25:36.197059,"I love this thing.

a few things to know for a much better setup-- 

you dont need a Oculus link cable to connect to play games on a gaming pc ,you can use ""Virtual Desktop"" (youtube how to side load onto the quest ""cas and cherry vr"") for a wireless setup that works great. 

also the issue with the battery strap and them breaking alternative 

go with a frankenquest setup---get a vive deluxe audio strap (could find for (100.00 found mine on ebay for 86.00 new)

the D.A.S. adapters are sold on etsy. I bought ""Metaversemake""20.99 for a sturdy setup .
for a more seamless build you can get one from ""Businesscompanyvr"" (doesnt use velcro for middle strap which i like )19.99+ shipping.

Annnnddd you can get a universal battery mount from ""tycotech3dprinting"".24.99 also on etsy.

Comes a little over the battery strap (which i have and compared) but i much rather have this superb setup.

it's definitely better in terms of being a counterweight and way more battery life depending on the powerbank you choose.

 the vive headset is way more comfortable  then both straps from oculus. 

The audio built in the headset vs the vive strap is *pffffttt* (meaning trash) compared to the strap. 

All in all its modular and well worth it.see you on population one .#joshmagosh25",2022-05-18 18:25:36.197059,5,5
2022-05-18 18:25:36.275238,"Simply put: Oculus Quest 2 in AMAZING!.  The games and videos are so immersive that they defy description.  It is literally like being transported to another world.  You can climb Mt. Everest, or cliff dive.  You can play games that allow you to fly.  You can watch movies on an IMAX theater sized screen in your own living room.  It is truly incredible.
That being said, I would have given it five stars if not for a few things that are a bit of a drawback.  The first (and biggest for me) is that there is no way to have more than one user account.  My husband and I both use it but he is the sole account holder so if advances in a game, I must play at that level also.  I also could see this being an issue if you had young children and didn't want them to have access to a more graphic or scary game.  
The second issue is the navigation--it is not very intuitive and I sometimes find myself spending a ridiculous amount of time just finding apps that we've purchased or a video I wanted to watch.  There is talk of updates that will improve navigation and even a rumor that a pending update will allow mulitple user accounts but, for now, this is what we have.  It's still an unbelievably fun piece of tech that has provided hours of entertainment and (suprisingly) exercise.",2022-05-18 18:25:36.275238,4,4

2022-05-18 18:25:37.048621,I need to preface this review by saying this is the first real VR I have had other than the one that came with your galaxy phone which is required to run it.    The Oculus 2 is light years better in every way.   I love the fact that you can cast out to a mobile device or chromecast with a touch of a button.   The weight of the device is not too bad and even better with purchase of the elite strap.   Battery life for me seem to run about a solid 2 hours or more.   It does get a little hot on the face.   Not the unit itself as much of the lack of airflow to the face.   That's pretty standard with this tech.    Graphics are great and the sound is very good for not having to wear headphones.   The head strap speakers do an adequate job for my taste.    The pass through cameras are very helpful in knowing your surroundings.   I opted for the larger memory unit since games are stored on the device.    I wish they had a larger catalog of software for it on the Oculus app.   Once I purchase the link cable and connect it to a PC - it should give a broader selection.   Games i've purchased so far is Walking Dead & Start Wars Episode 1.    Both are great games.   I am having a blast with this thing.  Highly recommend.    Don't forget to go in and adjust your privacy settings to limit the amount of data that is shared with Facebook.,2022-05-18 18:25:37.048621,5,5
2022-05-18 18:25:37.132448,"This is my first VR.  The first day I put it on, I was amazed on how I am fully immersed not only in playing games but watching online movies.   The unit goes to standby mode when watching movies.  I read that you have to constantly move your head to avoid this.  Oculus engineers are aware of the problem and are in the process of fixing it.  It had one update since I bought it, but unfortunately it has not been fixed yet.  It does not go on standby during games though.  The standard headstrap is not at all comfortable.  I never tried the elite head strap but I am reading that that too easily breaks.  Each controller uses one AA battery and it lasted me a month before I had to replace it.  I am not sure how long the battery of the unit lasts because I never tried it with the headset unplugged.  When it is plugged, the battery level stays at 77% the whole time until you turn it off.   The sensors work at the dimmest red light.  I had no problem dimming my lights and the unit can still keep track of my hand movements.  The foam that touches your face is also not the most comfortable foam.  It leaves red streaks after an hour of using it.   The unit itself if great though.  You just have to spend more on aftermarket accessories to make it even greater. The clarity of the screen is acceptable.  Watching 3D movies is a great experience!",2022-05-18 18:25:37.132448,3,3
2022-05-18 18:25:37.205265,"So I give the Oculas Quest 2 ,four stars because the head strap is just enough of a strap to work, the rest of the system it self being contained in a head unit and have the capabilities that it has is pretty amazing, 

Now graphically I was expecting to be a bit better but it still beats out a Nintendo switch easy and is almost Xbox S graphics in comparison depending on the game and you have keep in mind that graphics are all around you over being on a flat screen in front of you,

Game play is what Nintendo should be at by now being they did the whole work out get your body moving thing with the Wii, and sorta the Switch but it’s just done right with Oculas.

I love the thing I look forward to when I get off of work to go play this thing, it can get the adrenaline flowing! 

I’ve gotten some good moments of motion butterflies in my stomach a fair amount of times and just work through it and I have a great time!

There don’t seem to be very many games but they are adding stuff fairly frequently and they just allowed Side quest stuff to be added so you can play other games other than Oculas quest 2 games, even demos or unfinished games companies are allowing you to try out.

So I’m impressed with it and I’m adding things as fast as I can to make the experience even better.

I recommend this highly snd your missing out on something very cool!!",2022-05-18 18:25:37.205265,4,4
2022-05-18 18:25:37.288059,"I can't say enough good things about this VR headset.  Having started with a Pixel Phone Daydream, then to an HP connected PCVR headset, the freedom of having a wireless VR headset with the high quality 6DOF tracking is just amazing!  Right now, I'm using it to play Star Wars Squadrons using a Thrustmaster flight stick and it is just mind blowingly good (game purchased on Steam, played using SteamVR, with Virtual Desktop App on Quest, and Sidequest loaded Virtual Desktop app).  For work, ImmersedVR allows you to map a physical keyboard to a virtual keyboard and work with as many monitors as you want, or even share them with others working with your in the same virtual room.  Microsoft's AltSpaceVR, Facebook's Horizon, VRChat, Rec Room and others provide social interaction in a time when many are in lockdown and can get it no other way.  VR's time has come and this headset is at the forefront!  There are a couple negatives to this unit though including the default head strap which is not very comfortable.  I recommend upgrading to the elite or elite with battery, or using the FrankinQuest mod found on YouTube.  Also, you have to be sure to shut it all the way down as letting it sleep seems to drain the battery quicker than I would expect.  Perhaps it's waking up because it sits on my desk and picks up movement. No other issues for me and I can't get enough of this thing.",2022-05-18 18:25:37.288059,5,5
2022-05-18 18:25:37.375796,"After having the Oculus Go, this was a good upgrade worth the money.  It is a little heavy and the head strap on the top is a little difficult to adjust, making it a little difficult to get comfortable.  But once you get everything set the way you want, you are good to go.  The upgrade in graphics and speed is a good step up.  Battery life is about the same as the old one.  You can play for a couple of hours before needing a recharge.  The guardian system field of play works good.  I don't like the haze on the lenses though. I wish they were clear.  I think they do it to help remove the ghosting affect.  Overall I think they are worth the money, but still need some improvements.  Every iteration Oculus comes out with seems to make the game a little better.  I also have the Oculus Rift and I play this more since I don't have to deal with the wires and the graphics are almost as good.  The one thing they messed up on was the speakers.  Why would they want everyone in the room to hear what you are playing??  This causes me to use my plug in ear buds to play.  The last model's speakers were much better as they were over your ears and only the player could hear what's going on.  Hopefully they fix this on the next model.  My kids and grandkids love to play this game.  Two of my daughters have the Quest 2 also, and they bring them to the house and we play against each other.  It's very easy to connect.",2022-05-18 18:25:37.375796,4,4
2022-05-18 18:25:37.508443,"I am a first generation gamer. The modern graphics processor begins with the 3D add-in cards in 1995. I bought the first PC version Tomb Raider game and excitedly spent hours trouble shooting installation errors to achieve an amazing 320x200 experience.  My 4MB 3Dfx Voodoo1 Graphics card patched 640x480 resolution. Quake got 41 frames per second at a resolution of 320 x 200.  “Back in the day’s”, this was geek speak for unbelievable and awesome.  Today, 60 FPS is workable and 120 FPS look like real life. Back then a single graphics card cost more than the Oculus 2. And the Graphics card required installation into a computer that in today’s standard is less powerful than a free watch inside a box of cereal. (Only a slight exaggeration)  Your phone has 100,000 times the processing power of the computer that landed man on the moon 50 years ago. Today with the Oculus 2 you can VR walk on the moon.  You can adjust the resolution at 5408 x 2736 compared to a pixilated 320 x 200 resolution.  The Oculus experience feels so real that weightless remains after removing the headset. At this rate of change, Oculus will develop Quantum mechanics technologies for photon entanglement and teleport our bodies to the moon. Forgive the Sci-fi, but the fantasy is real… get the Oculus. An error free experience. Today I walk inside a magical, and nearly hologram version of Tomb Raider.   You can’t imagine the exceptional experience.  Get the Oculus2.",2022-05-18 18:25:37.508443,5,5
2022-05-18 18:25:37.681825,"The Quest 2 is amazing. I'm an original Quest owner, and the improved resolution and clarity in the screen alone make these well-worth it (not to mention these were actually cheaper than the original Quest!) I recommend getting the elite strap upgrade with the battery. A bit pricey, but worth it. 

For those who were owners of the original Oculus Quest and looking to upgrade, be warned of two things:

1) I lost most of my progress of my games. Any game that does not do a cloud save will lose all progress. (Not a big deal, but do I really want to start my Beat Saber campaign all over? Did I want to start The Room from scratch again? Sigh.) Had I done my homework in advance, I would have realized this and took some time to copy some files from my original quest first from the few games I didn't want to start over. Not a big deal, just a little irritating. Search online for methods to move your game files from your old quest to the new one before you put the old Quest to rest.

2) The screen is LCD, not OLED. Great resolution, and higher refresh rate. However, you sacrifice being able to see true black. This is definitely noticeable in games with dark scenes. It's by no means a game stopper, and I only noticed because I was an original Quest owner. That's about the only thing the original Quest had going for it over this new one. Everything else makes this a superior upgrade. 

I highly recommend these for both gaming and fitness.",2022-05-18 18:25:37.681825,5,5
2022-05-18 18:25:37.754628,"Overall, this headset is pretty well built and user-friendly. There's also the convenience of not needing a PC, as you can just wirelessly connect to Wi-Fi. 

However, if you have the money, room space, and a powerful PC, I would highly recommend the Valve Index or HTC Vive Pro 2 instead. 

There were a few factors of this headset that I didn't like, one being the issue of battery life. According to a couple articles and YouTube reviews, you'll receive an average of 2-3 hours dependent upon the game or media app you launch. But according to my own experience, you'll be fortunate to receive BARELY 2-hours of gameplay before this headset dies. 

Another issue I have with this headset is the need for a Facebook account. While it doesn't personally affect me that much, it still raises the question of why it's necessary. Regardless, I just decided to make an ""inactive"" account, and hope for the best.

Last issue I have with this headset is the uncomfortable headstrap. I understand that you get what you pay for. However, it's obvious that if you want to have a ""good time,"" you're going to need to buy oculus accessories that provide that extra comfort, and battery life. In the end, you'll probably end up paying just as much for this headset and its accessories as you would the other headsets I mentioned above.

But even with these issues, if you don't have the money, the space, a strong PC, or these problems just don't bother you, I'd still recommend this headset as it's the best one out, for now.",2022-05-18 18:25:37.754628,3,3
2022-05-18 18:25:37.824487,All I can say is wow wow wow oh I love this machine my husband and I wanted to purchase a PlayStation five but we're over the 35 crowd so we weren't sure if we wanted to invest in another playstation again. Mind you at the fact that PlayStation right now is almost impossible to get your hands on unless you want to be ripped off. So we chose to go through the oculus direction of soon to be meta-Facebook. Lotta people are not too sure if they want to buy this oculus because of the new change of name and ownership. But I'm gonna tell you something right now there's no new machine expect it to come out for the next 2 to 3 years so regardless you still get updates on your device. You should and it would be very intelligent to buy this machine because they are flying off the rocks if you can get your hands on them I've never had an experience quite like I have on this machine as a kid always dreamt about what having VR would be like and it is amazing it feels like you are really there. The next day after we played it my husband and I had dreamed that we were in this world we were playing it was really wicked you were going to love it it is so much fun. It definitely opens up to its name and let me tell you something yeah the price might steer you away but there's no price that you could put on the experience you get with this virtual reality it is amazing and it's only going to get better Mark Zuckerberg is improving and he's about to throw a big bang out there in the market so if you have one of these bad boys you win!,2022-05-18 18:25:37.824487,5,5
2022-05-18 18:25:37.893286,"What a great bang-for-buck gadget! The Quest 2 is priced much better than the Quest 1, and that is a huge deal if you can understand how overpriced last years version was (+100$).

As an out-of-the-box gadget, you're getting a great easy to use VR device that will entertain users of all ages. Yes, you're not getting the full fidelity graphics of a high-end video card enabled computer with VR, but you're at least getting the same immersion and smoothness that tricks your brain into ""being there"" which is the core of this generation's VR experiences.

As a tethered ""Oculus Link"" cable (sold-separately) HMD supported by your high-end video card and desktop VR games upgrading from say, the Rift CV1, you're basically getting Rift-S functionality out of this setup, which is pretty darn great value not having to side-grade and spend more money.

If the last paragraph meant nothing to you, no worries because the standalone capability and the Quest 2 app store is probably all you will be needing to enjoy this purchase without regret.

A few things to note. You are unable to use this device currently in darkness and will need low light for the sensor cameras to keep your orientation in the VR environment. A workaround to this is to invest in a small and cheap IR light meant for security cameras to illuminate your gaming area, as the cameras also on the Q2 would be able to see in complete darkness in the same way.

I bought this system because I discovered a couple years ago that everyone in my family could enjoy VR--even my special needs son, who really loves ""riding"" virtual rollercoasters! The fact that you can take it anywhere without a computer is amazing!

I've also discovered that, because it is so much more physical than most gaming consoles, it's a great way to get a work out! Don't even think about wearing any warm clothes while you're playing Pistol Whip-- I get so sweaty after a few rounds of that game!

My biggest complaint is something that I hope they'll consider changing in the future with a software update: Unlike Xbox or Playstation, You can only have one account on the system at a time, which means if the individual games don't provide separate save slots (thankfully, Super Hot does), then any time someone else gets on, you'll lose your progress on that game when they play it! This seems like a huge oversight, and is why I deducted one star. I also don't like that a Facebook account is required, but considering its owned by Facebook, I don't expect that to change any time soon.

PROS:
• All-in-one advanced VR gaming
• Decent graphics
• Excellent selection of games (I recommend Superhot, Pistol Whip and The Climb, as well as the Vader trilogy)
• Great way to exercise!
• It just feels so immersive!

• Only allows for 1 user account
• Must connect to Facebook",2022-05-18 18:25:38.006954,4,4
2022-05-18 18:25:38.078770,"The only way I can describe owning the Oculus is that it is just like having an indoor/outdoor pool that you don’t have to do any work to maintain. Whenever you feel stressed, bored, or tired of your surroundings all you have to do is put the headset on and jump right on in for the experience of a lifetime.
It’s like being on vacation when everything you know disappears to morph into a totally different environment. Amazing.
I also love the Oculus because you don’t need the TV or a computer to play it. So if other household members have claimed those devices you can still play the Oculus.
I play in the kitchen sometimes in between my chores.
If you like puzzles, or if you like meditation, or maybe you just like to be terrified...this is the game for you.
The downsides? After about 45 minutes of play the headset gets uncomfortable. For us this is a good thing because it keeps it fair for the next persons turn.
Also, the battery life only lasts about 2 to 3 hours.
Lastly, if you want to play games from the computer you need a 65.00 USB cord especially made for the Oculus. STEAM has some games you can enjoy but get the cord first if you want to do that. We haven’t done this yet so I can’t say what that’s like. My son does enjoy YouTube videos specifically made for Oculus. 
Also, there is an age limit on children playing this game but I am not sure what it is. I would look it up first, it can be scary if they suddenly find themselves up high somewhere or if freaky creatures or scary things come at them.
Other than that, I fully recommend this game to anyone I come across. Beat Buy always gives me great customer service.",2022-05-18 18:25:38.078770,5,5

Better than Rift S:
1. Image quality is certainly better. Less screen door effect.
2. No cord, no PC required. Turn it on and play. Can connect to your PC wirelessly and play many of your Steam games through the wifi connection. (Some assembly required) 
2B: Can install apps like Netflix and Hulu and watch your favorite shows on a ""huge screen"" from the comfort of your recliner. It's pretty cool.
3. Built in speakers are WAY better than Rift S. I spent hours trying to cobble together proper speakers for the S and eventually broke the headphone jack. Sound is really quite good.

Worse than Rift S:
1. Janky head strap. Premium strap an absolute requirement to attain any sort of comfort. Once purchased and installed, it's great and quite comfortable.
2. ""Sweet Spot"" is smaller. Anything outside that small area becomes increasingly blurry.
3. Manual IPD has only 3 settling which creates more of a binocular image than the S. You can tell you're looking through two different lenses/screens. Very noticable and distracting when playing 1st person games with any sort of fast/large movements. Had to disable the comfort ring (forget what it's called) for movement in Skyrim it was so bad. 
4. Cannot play top tier/heavy system requirement games even through the link cable. USB is simply no replacement for a dedicated Display Port. Skyrim was playable but Fallout 4 was not, and these are older titles. No way you could run Cyberpunk (assuming they make it VR) through USB.",2022-05-18 18:25:38.174505,4,4

The games are really fun, the entertainment is awesome, and in some cases, you can get quite the workout from some of the apps (there are even fitness apps, which I haven't tried yet, I'm just talking games alone, but I'm looking forward to trying everything else the Oculus has to offer).

All in all, they are amazing. After buying a set for myself, my family started buying their own, and we've been playing online together. There's even a microphone so you can chat live with the people you're playing with (or against).

What surprised me the most, was how good the built in sound quality is on the unit itself, without headphones. But if you want the full immersive experience, I do recommend a pair of noise-cancelling ones. 

The reason it loses one star from me is that the battery life is abysmal, topping out at around two and a half hours, with a charge time of about an hour and a half. Additionally, it doesn't really show you everything it's capable of. You have to figure out a lot of things on your own, but that can also be a lot of fun, as you discover all sortsa new features you didn't even know the thing was capable of. 

At the end of the day, I'd still rather play video games traditionally in front of a television screen with a controller, but this is definitely worthy the moniker of being one your ""game systems."" The best I can say is that you need to try it for yourself. Bite the bullet and buy one, or find a friend who has one and demo it, because chances are, you'll be picking up one for yourself after. It's absolutely worth the money.",2022-05-18 18:25:38.381952,4,4
2022-05-18 18:25:38.545515,"I’m a VR enthusiast who’s owned nearly every major VR headset for the past several years.  I’m currently using the Oculus Quest 2, an HP Reverb G2 and a Valve Index.  All three of those headsets have their pros and cons, but the easiest one to recommend to anyone new to VR is the Oculus Quest 2.  It’s truly amazing what Facebook has been able to do in a stand-alone headset (no PC required) for only $300-400, and Oculus Link works surprisingly well if you want to play PC only VR games (assuming you have an adequately powerful PC).  It’s very easy to set up and use (since a PC is not required), the software library is extensive and high quality, the controllers and tracking work great, and it’s comfortable - although I’ve been using the Elite Strap with Battery Pack from day one, so I can’t really comment on the stock strap, but the Elite Strap is comfortable enough (although nothing compared to the G2 or Index).

If you’re upgrading from an Oculus Quest 1, be warned that not everything is better...  The resolution upgrade is noticeable, but the lack of fine IPD adjustment was a big step back - the Quest 2 IPD presets don’t fit me perfectly and that’s negatively impacted me personally.  Also, the sweet spot on the Quest 2 is noticeably smaller than the Quest 1 - anything slightly off center of your vision is much blurrier than the Quest 1.  Finally, the black levels on the Quest 2 are not nearly as good as the Quest 1 - this was to be expected when moving from OLED panels to LCD, but you’ll definitely notice the much lighter blacks.  So while I was hopeful I could retire my Quest 1 when I got my Quest 2, I’m still holding on to it for now due to all of these issues.  If you’re wondering, I haven’t noticed a big difference in the controllers and tracking between the Quest 1 and 2.",2022-05-18 18:25:38.545515,5,5
2022-05-18 18:25:38.760009,"I have a PSVR but decided to try out the Quest 2 due to the good reviews, the fact that it might be some time before Sony comes out with a updated PSVR2 and the fact that is not hard wired to anything.  I am very happy with the Q2, the graphics are much better than the PSVR though the PSVR has decent to good graphics depending on the  game you are playing.  I also picked up the extra battery that is in the much better head strap.  The extra battery along with the battery in the headset makes a big difference for extended game play.  With both batteries, I have yet to run out of juice during the times that I usually play.  Also, I don't have to play in one particular place due to being hard wired to a PC or a game console.  I now play in the living room which is a more open area. 

Pros:

1. Very nice, sharp graphics
2. No cables  attached
3. See thru mode (so you can see what's going on in the room 
    without taking off the headset.
4. light weight unit
5. Great tracking
6. Load times are short
7. Able to set up safe room boundaries to play within
8. Store available (through Wi-Fi) to buy and download games 
    directly to the headset
9. Downloads are fast

Cons:

Top volume on the headset is to low, the first 3 or 4 bars don't even get you any sound.  It's just enough sound but I would like more.  I'll have to look at options for a set of phones that has a volume control to get more loudness and some bass.  I'll miss the sound I could get with the PSVR coming from a multi speaker audio system which would be all around me.

Not enough good games (yet).  I'm sure more are on the way but the PSVR has a ton in comparison.

Requires a FB account.  For a person like me who doesn't care for social media, I had to weigh the good and the bad and decided to sign up.  I don't plan on using the account for anything else.",2022-05-18 18:25:38.760009,5,5
2022-05-18 18:25:38.830846,"This is actually the worst headset I've owned. I've tried original oculus and rift s and I have owned a psvr for some time, here's why this is gets 1 star:

-Poor choice of  materials that come in direct contact with your face  with no suitable first party replacements.

- poor head strap and replacing the headstrap with the better one available is nerve wracking and could have been designed better.

-Good screen, almost. The screen is clear, but theres still alot of glare with any bright white text, this is... passable.

-good controllers, no complaints here

-decent battery, but for some reason the headset would come on  its own so even if I left it with 90% it would be dead by the end of the day.

-decent game and apps library, if you've never been apart of the vr ecosystem you may be impressed, however as a psvr owner, I have most of the good games already and theres far more interesting games on psvr with the exception of supernatural, which is great! But it doesn't make a 400$ investment worth it.

-absolutely awful is that this thing has to be tied to an active Facebook account, even if you can activate it without triggering a ban on your account ( which has apparently happened to more than a few already, your still stuck giving money to Facebook and your allowing them to essentially have cameras and microphones in your home so if you were scared of alexa, then be terrified of this.  Originally it was my understanding that you wouldn't be forced to have a Facebook account as long as you had an ocules account for atleast the next 3 years. However thats not the case, apparently you have to merge accounts the moment you get a quest 2. So if you thought you might just wait and merge accounts to see if face books going to start shoving ads in your face you'll be disappointed, let's all just hope they don't start making it like actual Facebook.",2022-05-18 18:25:38.830846,1,1
2022-05-18 18:25:38.885834,"Hi ... this is my 2nd VR headset, I bought a Oculus Riff right after it came out. I enjoyed the headset but hated the light house sensors (little sensors on a couple of stands that point into your playing area). I had to reconfigure the playing area every time I went from standing to sitting (driving and racing games). 
When the Quest 2 was introduced, the price point was low enough for me to ditch the light house sensors and play games, watch movies and videos anywhere. I was finally rid of those pesky sensors.
This headset is standalone. You can take it anywhere and play without the need for cables, a PC or any sensors.  
Download games and videos right from the Oculus or other third party web sites. I highly recommend Beat Saber and Pistol Whip. 
Add a direct link cable (the one that comes with it is way too short) and connect to a VR ready PC and play a bazillion VR PC games. Haven't tried the wireless link yet ... to busy playing Pistol Whip.
This headset at the $300 price point is a steal. Jump on YouTube and watch video after video where reviewers praise this headset. 
Yes, they took some short cuts to meet the price point, but the video resolution on this device was not one of them.  Some don't like the head strap, I'm fine with it. Some say the sound quality is sub par, it has a headphone jack on the device. Just plug in your favorite headphones or earbuds if you want better sound. I myself worry about the white color getting dirty, but so far ... so good.
If you wear glasses, they will fit inside the headset ... or at least mine do. They also offer the option of buying frames that include you eyeglass prescription that snap right into the headset. I wear bifocals and I have tried playing and without them. I generally play without.
The headset does only offer three eye distance settings. This is fine for most people. Your results may very.
This headset out performs headsets costing twice as much in video quality and resolution. 
Again ... at this price, it is an amazing value. The most bang for the buck out there in VR headsets.",2022-05-18 18:25:38.885834,5,5
2022-05-18 18:25:39.021450,"I've never really used vr before (well except a quick try of google cardboard but compared to the quest that was very primative), but I really wanted to get into it without having to also shell out for a souped up pc to connect to a headset. So when I found out about the quest and how it can run in either standalone or tethered mode I was excited to give it a shot. 

Pros are the guardian system works very well, I was worried about knocking into walls and stuff in my small room but having the ability to draw a safe boundary is awesome. I also like that you can side load android apks, which extend the usefulness of the quest. Additionally the controllers work very well and the AA batteries last quite awhile. Build quality is superb, no worries everything could take a good whack and still work fine. 

Cons are the headset battery isn't so great (around 2 hours of heavy use), the strap that comes with the headset is pretty uncomfortable, and no native support for usb otg devices plugged in to usb c (though this can be worked around using android file browsers but it's not ideal). Finally my biggest gripe at the moment is that while the oculus store has some amazing games that will give some unique experiences, the selection just isn't very big right now and some of the pricing is questionable ($25 for some rather short 2-3 hour games with little replayability is steep imo). And last but not least is I've found certain fast moving games tend to make me rather motion sick after a little while (this isn't a knock on the product, but something I need to work on personally lol and may affect other's purchasing decision).

Now this can change in the future, and I really hope more developers adopt the platform to release even more content going forward. That's what I think the future of the quest hinges on, the store environment growing into something like the apple store or google play. Anyway all in all because of the strengths and in spite of the weaknesses I think the current iteration of the quest is definitely worth the asking price and I look forward to seeing future versions and how they shape the vr landscape!",2022-05-18 18:25:39.021450,5,5
2022-05-18 18:25:39.089298,"As a gamer and technology enthusiast, I’m usually excited about new consoles, gadgets and technology. However, VR was not one of those things. When Zuck outlined his vision for the metaverse, I was intrigued by the fact that if this takes off, it creates a whole new digital economy with new business opportunities for creators and artists alike. So I picked up a headset to see what all the hype was about. Wow, was I blown away! The Q2 presented me with a digital experience that was far beyond my expectations. It really opened my eyes to a new world that I didn’t think twice about before but I’m happy I took a chance on it.  While it is an impressive display of tech, it falls short on a few key marks. 1. The headset is not extremely comfortable for long periods of time. Even with the Elite strap with battery, I still find that it weighs my head down and my neck and shoulders get tight, so it isn’t as well balanced as I hoped. 2. The IPD adjustment is fixed to three specific positions. 58mm, 63mm, and 68mm. My IPD measures as 66mm, so it will never match my IPD for a perfect display alignment. The image is good, but its not as crisp and sharp as i’d really like it to be. Hopefully Meta develops and implements software adjustments for users like me with an IPD that lands between their fixed positions. 3. While the variety of software is good, it’s not great. I’d love to see a wider selection of more casual and social style offerings and options that aren’t infilitrated with 11 year-olds. On the flip side, there are outstanding titles to play like “Golf+” and “PokerStars VR” and i’m sure in time, the titles will grow and expand into great franchises and VR experiences. If you’re still a skeptic, try one out first and see if you like it before purchasing one. If you’re on the edge and leaning towards getting a Q2, take the leap, you will be glad you did. Just don’t expect everything to be perfect and refined, there is certainly still room for improvement on Q2 and as long as you maintain reasonable expectations, there’s a lot of fun and exciting new experiences to be had as you explore the world of VR. Bottom Line: It’s good, not great but Quest 2 is dripping with potential and possibility.",2022-05-18 18:25:39.089298,4,4
2022-05-18 18:25:39.159082,"The Oculus - Quest 2 is just okay.  The product is nice and cool.  The VR experience without a doubt is awesome, but short lived for the cost of the unit.  I don't feel the price is reflect of the production environment available.  

Without a doubt this expensive toy will get tossed in the closet in less than 6 months along with $430 price tag after taxes plus any extra games I bought.  I'll be more disappointed when I see the sale price kick in and wonder why I bought it in the first place.  For the kids of course, duh...

The system did not come with any free game content or experience.  There is not a lot of game content to really choose from or demo.  Not a big store to choose free games that bombard you with advertising like on Android or Apple.  Would be nice to see some Apple or Android games ported over.  Something like Angry Birds would be so cool in VR.  An online library with paid subscription would be better.    

With that being said, the quality and experience of the product are good.  I just feel that price associated with what you get is less than production worthy.  A lot of the extra accessories they sale on the side should of been included with the Oculus.  For example, the more advanced headband and carrying case.  Those two items combined are about $200.  Only $100 shy of the low end version of the Oculus.  No protective case?  That's right, but you get to keep the nice box it came in!  The out of box headband is a headache sometimes.    

Also not a big fan of 64 GB vs 256 GB version for an extra $100.  They should of just integrated a micro SD expansion slot.  I think that would of been better than locking the end user into two choices.  Would of rather had a cheaper version in the middle with 100 GB with an expansion slot option.

For my last Karen Cry, I do not use Facebook and did not have an account until I was force to create one by simply owning the Oculus.  So by entering the VR world, Facebook gets to enter my world now.  I'm so 1984, I don't want to be trolled.

In conclusion the Oculus - Quest 2 is a quality made product with a awesome new experience.  I just feel the product is over priced and not equally matched with a wide selection of games to support it just yet.  Still has a long way to go and the public is being used to test it.",2022-05-18 18:25:39.159082,3,3
2022-05-18 18:25:39.235880,"I initially purchased this to use as an alternative for fitness. With the state of the world right now, I don’t enjoy going for jogs having to wear a mask. Treadmill has become too monotonous. Enter the Oculus Quest 2. 

There are some standard demos and immersion videos you can experience, but I just went straight in and purchased FitXR ($29.99). Immediately felt it was worth every penny. Just keep in mind that to get the maximum workout you have to mindfully squat and lunge deeply using current form. Sure you can just bow or lean out of the way, but why? The boxing has impact visuals that show when you hit harder. I go for blood jabbing/hooking/uppercutting hard like a real fight the whole time. The dance workouts? You’ll laugh at yourself for having so much fun with them! Guaranteed!!

Interestingly enough, you can even play this while sitting down or in bed. Just set the floor level correctly. The game is customizable to remove features like dodging/ducking. Even someone in a wheelchair can use it and have a great experience. 

Powers on quickly. Connects to your WiFi easily enough (typing in the long wireless passphrase is a bit annoying using the virtual keyboard). Graphics are fun as you can literally turn 360 degrees and look all around and above you. You “carve out” the area you want to play in using the controller (you literally see - via external cameras - your real world environment). If you start to close to your carved out boundary? A virtual wall appears to remind you where your limits are. Swimming with sharks was interesting as is traveling to say Dubai or Mt. Everest. The next day I went all in and got the following:
   o Beat Saber $29.99
   o The Thrill of the Fight $9.99
   o Vader Immortal Episode III $9.99

I wish it came with a storage case, but I just got a Hermitshell hard case from Amazon. No need to spend $30-50 on a stand. Just use cheap wall mount hooks or even plastic ones with 3M adhesive on the back (like I use for loofahs in the shower). 

The only NEGATIVE I can think of is shared use of the headset is kind of gross and unsanitary to me. You will sweat. Facial oils (and/or makeup) will transfer. They really should include multiple colored pads to connect to the head unit so each user can pop on their own color coded spacer. 

Totally recommend getting an Oculus Quest 2. Most innovative fun I’ve had in decades.",2022-05-18 18:25:39.235880,5,5
2022-05-18 18:25:39.312672,"Virtual Reality is a word that inspires a lot of phrases, many revolving around the word ""gimmick."" But with this 2.0 update to the Oculus Quest system, it makes the VR world a little bit more accessible and mainstream.
The only real compromise is giving up your facebook details.

Tackling that last item first, since facebook owns the Oculus brand they now require your credentials in order to use the item. If that's a huge no-no for you, then this item will NOT work. Period. You cannot use the device without linking your facebook account, so avoid if you value your online privacy.

Bearing the above in mind, this is an excellent intro experience for VR games and services. Oculus has crafted some really great games like Population One and Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge with Quest 2 in mind. The tracking and the controls are easy to get through and there's no feeling of crash course when starting up. You're gently guided through the process and allowed time to adjust.

Battery life is about 2 hours, so don't expect to game for an extended period of time. Remember to set it on the charger after every use, otherwise you'll be disappointed at how life is left, especially if you've only taken it off and left it idle. The controller battery life is solid, but don't be surprised if your dominant hand controller eats up faster (which makes complete sense).

Beyond the facebook requirement, the only negative I would give is the comfort level. The strap for the unit is clearly designed for ease of make, not wearer comfort. It's just a hard cloth strap, held on via velcro, which makes it very awkward to adjust while on your head. And then there are the lenses. Unlike other VR headsets - where there is an adjustable scale for the lenses for the wearer's comfort - the lens have three different lock-in spots that can adjust to. That's it. Take it or leave it. If you're like me, you're never getting a ""perfect"" alignment of the lenses to your eyes, and it's less than ideal. Eventually you adjust, but it's something that could be a potential issue for some.

Overall, if you're interested in VR and have the 300-400 to spare (go for the larger one as games development for it gets more intense) this is definitely worth it. You're getting a device that isn't bogged down by cables or a PC link, allowing you so much freedom, minus the freedom of anonymity from facebook.",2022-05-18 18:25:39.312672,5,5
2022-05-18 18:25:39.409414,"I've been having an excellent time with the headset! No problems so far, a ton of fun to be had, and with PC titles possible via a wireless link to my network (my PC does need to be connected to my ethernet network via a hardwire cable for reliability and speed, but it was anyway so it didn't really matter).

I've owned the Oculus DK1, DK2, and the CV1, and it's been a blast following the legacy that original Kickstarter all those years ago has been leaving. Every time I used my CV1, I would think to myself, ""this would be perfect, if only I didn't need this cable hanging from my head"". It was literally the one hang-up I'd had with the platform. Well, when the headset is doing what it's designed for - playing games on its native android environment - let me tell you, I've finally gotten lost in VR. I'll take my headset off and legitimately have no idea which way I'd turned, the world presented to me via this technology being just that enveloping. Mind, you never forget you're using VR - it's not a magical experience, and it's nowhere near approaching ""The Matrix"" films, but ever since the CV1 it really has been something special. Less the cable with better resolution, no dedicated computer required, and no extra cables to run - yes, this one's worth it for most people.
Now, if you happen to already have a PC with strong enough hardware and it happens to be connected to your network via a hardwire cable (or can be), then a wireless link to your PC is not only possible, it's downright viable - enjoyable even. I've been using it to play the PC version of VRChat wirelessly on my Quest 2. And, it doesn't have to be in the same room as your PC if your cable is long enough.
Honestly, this is the best price I genuinely believe anyone will find on a headset with the features this one has. Now, that's very likely due to the fact that you require a Facebook account to use the headset. At least for the first time you power it on, you'll need to connect it to the internet and log into your Facebook account. This may, rightfully, skeeve some people out. If you're one who just can't allow Facebook to pervade any experience you have or if you just do not want to create a Facebook account then I'd look elsewhere for your VR fix. Just know that, for this monetary price tag, there's far more here than I expected, having a lot of experience in VR - and specifically with Oculus - under my belt.",2022-05-18 18:25:39.409414,5,5
2022-05-18 18:25:39.528001,"This is a solid product with compromises. 

The graphics is decent for what it is. The resolution of the screen is good. Tracking is acceptable in ideal conditions.

A facebook product is always going be problematic because of ... well facebook. The social aspect of the platform is lacking, it's not quite integrated with facebook (although it REQUIRES you to have a facebook account.)

I have idiot friends that freaked out when the apps asked for ""recording permission."" Recording permission is just android's way of saying Mic permission. If they can use the mic they can record you. The choice of wording sucks but no it's (likely) not keeping recordings of you.

You should consider buying the elite strap (after they get the quality control in check). Because it is all-in-one, the thing is front heavy. You'll experience greater comfort if there is some sort of counterweight in the back.

FIGURE OUT YOUR IPD BEFORE YOU BUY IT - oculus supports 58, 63, 68. Unfortunately my IPD is 73. I have a big head. like with the facial interface, I had to buy the extra fit pack in order to get one that fits my face. In order to cut cost, they left people like me behind. (there is nothing you can really do to fix the IPD issue especially with a single LCD screen design) Essentially, I get a much narrower FOV than you would normally.

Tracking requires you to be a room without lights that distracts the cameras from seeing the controllers. You'll find yourself missing blocks in beat saber if you have something like Christmas lights hanging on your walls. Experiment as your millage will vary.

Apps are extraordinarily expensive compared to games from big developers. Do calculate that into your total spending.

Audio is decent for on device solution. It's a bit quiet if you ask me. I have yet to find a good solution since having a over the ear headphone while I am sweaty playing VR is just not an attractive option. In ear headphones will create this suction on your eardrums when you move about so that's not pleasant either.

They are constantly making improvements on this device via software update. notionally 120hz support and native remote desktop etc.

Oculuslink is one feature that made this thing an no brainier for most people looking for entry level VR headset.

conclusion: 
If this device is physically compatible to you. It's well worth the price.
If you want better graphics, add a computer. The latency with Oculuslink is acceptable.",2022-05-18 18:25:39.528001,3,3
