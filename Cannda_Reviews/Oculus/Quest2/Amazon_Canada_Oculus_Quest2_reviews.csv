The ""new"" 128Gb Quest 2 is a welcome increase in storage space over the prior 64Gb model, as the OS eats up a fair bit of space on that storage.  Fortunately the apps and games are mostly small in install size.For a standalone VR headset (with ability to connect to a gaming PC for PCVR), it does a fantastic job at bringing you this experience.  However, the requirement for Facebook is a sour note to using it as it is tied to your real life social media account.  You can make a alias for it though so other gamers don't see your real name.. but still, the writing is on the wall that this is for personal data collection while you use it.  Take that for what it's worth, as the low cost is clearly subsidized from Facebook's personal data collection as the unit is sold at a loss otherwise.The Pros:-Small and portable.-VR capability is great.  It's not powerful to provide realistic graphics, but the games are really effective at giving you a sense of scale and being in the VR world.  Framerates are fast and colors are vivid.  It works great.-Low cost compared to everything else on the market (which requires a PC - which this doesn't).-Ability to cast gameplay to a chromecast type device for others to see.-Install sizes are small (most),Cons:- Facebook required.- The strap is uncomfortable and doesn't do a good job of keeping the weight off your face. It's essentially a fabric belt, so you'll want to invest in a better headband for more support.- Battery capacity gives you about 2+ hours playtime so it's quite low.  If you supplement with an external battery, the Quest will run off of that before it goes to it's own battery, so you'll want to invest in a battery pack for more playtime.- Lenses have a small focal ""sweet spot"" and this coupled with the troublesome headstrap means that you will frequently adjust the headset to reduce fatigue to your eyes.- Resolution varies in standalone games as the headset may need to lower resolution to allow for appropriate processing power - depending on the app.  While the headset is ""almost 2K per eye"", there will still be some blur, and in some games, you will notice a fair amount if the game drops the resolution as needed. This is not a frequent issue, but I am mentioning it just in case some owners wonder why game X is clearer than game Y.  Having said this, a number of titles have been patched for the higher processing power of the Quest 2's headset and do have increased resolution over the original Quest 1.- The Oculus game store does not have big-discount sales like Steam or Playstation for their VR headsets.  There is a daily deal and sometimes weekly deals with a couple of games in them, but the discounts range from about 9% to 30%.  Overall, games on Quest 2 will cost you more to purchase as most will stay at full price.In conclusion ..  don't look at the small list of Pros as a negative as what it does, it does great and is well worth the cost.  Just know that the cons show that it does have limitations so don't expect the moon, and the basic headset will likely need a better headband and external battery to get the best enjoyment out of it.  It's a 5 star headset absolutely - but Facebook's requirement is something to understand, as if your account is ever banned on Facebook... you will lose all your purchases and the headset will become useless.

I had the elite strap on for a few weeks and had gotten to use my headset roughly around 20 hours in those two weeks. It was fine during that time, fit well, seemed firm. However my computer's graphics card failed, and so I left my VR headset on the desk, next to my computer for several weeks while I got the warranty for my card to replace it. After I had my computer up and running again, again after the VR headset was sitting not being touched for several weeks, I picked it up (from the front, heavy side, not the strap) and the snap just snapped in half under its own weight. This is absolutely unacceptable for the price they are charging.  I had read the reviews of others saying the band snapped, figured it couldn't be as bad as they said, but sure enough, it's true, with no pressure, no force, just leave it on a desk for a few weeks and it will snap all on its own. Extremely disappointed.

I've been having disconnect issues with the Oculus disconnecting from my PC when using the link cable, since i bought it, when playing PC VR games.  I've seen the issues repeated by multiple users all over the net the past few months, with different ""fixes"" or reasons, from my USB port being loose, or software updates causing the problem.  It's none of these, its the cable itself thats the problem.  Look online into getting an Anker cable, or some other cable that is up to par with the transfer rates to play using your PC.  DO NOT BUY THE OFFICIAL CABLE, it is cheap crap.  I switched to an anker cable and extension, and it runs fine now.  IT was literally the Quest 2 link cable that was disconnecting.  What a waste of $120.  This cable is a legit scam.

While the link cable looks nice, feels nice, and works part of the time, it's incredibly faulty to justify the ridiculous pricetag.  I bought it thinking this would ensure the best connection for using my Quest 2 for PCVR, but no, it's junk.  I can't go more than half an hour without a random ""PC Disconnected"" message, which is insanely frustrating when playing lengthier games like Halflife Alyx.  Whenever this happens I have to take off the headset, shut down the game, shut down Steam, restart the Oculus app on my PC and start again.  This happens regularly using either the USBC port on my 2080TI, or on the motherboard itself.  Not sure if it's a faulty cable, bad link software, or what, but Oculus has been zero help in correcting the issue.  Spent two weeks dealing with support, sending logs back and forth, over and over, went through their standardized checklist of generic possible fixes(most of which having nothing to do with link, but humored them anyway), just to have them say ""will have to look into this further"" and stop responding.This is what I get for buying the first run of new hardware before they work out the faults.  Don't buy this cable.  Quest 2 is still good on it's own(for low level games/apps), but if you're wanting something for PCVR I'd highly recommend a different headset.  They might be pricier, but well worth it to avoid this headache.

I bought the Elite strap when I pre-ordered my Quest-2.It is much better than the standard strap that comes with the headset but at it's price point isn't that great. Yes, it does improve comfort, the strap tightening mechanism feels really cheap and it has no built in headphones (Something the Quest-2 desperately needs). Since getting this, I bought a Vive Deluxe Audio Strap and used 3D printed parts to attach it to my Quest-2 (Now called a FrankenQuest2), this is a amazing solution, yes, more expensive but you get what you pay for, this is very comfortable and the the built in headphones sound great. Personally, I'd skip the Oculus Elite strap and put that money towards a Vive Deluxe Audio Strap and make your own FrankenQuest2. :)

Initially I was planning to send this unit back, it gave me a headache after prolonged use and found the original strap sufficient, however, for programs demanding intense or medium movements the Elite strap is an absolute must. I purchased a couple of additional padding products to make it more comfortable. The back portion of the Elite strap is made of flexible rubber material which, in my opinion needs a bit more cushioning to make it  more comfortable, especially if the program demands the strap to be fairly tight to prevent movement of the headset. With these alterations I would happily recommend the Elite strap.

I first purchased a 128GB model at the end of September and it functioned well with my use of the Supernatural VR fitness program.  Then one day after my return window expires, the right controller became unresponsive and could not connect to the headset.  Oculus customer service took forever to connect and I  didn't receive a response.  When tried to factory reset the headset following Oculus's official instructions, the reset stuck on the initial page and could not progress further, and the right controller still remained as unconnected.  Out of frustration, I contacted Amazon to express my frustration and Amazon very kindly offered me a replacement unit despite my return/exchange window had expired the day before.  Hooray for Amazon!  Boooo for Oculus.

When I first got my Quest 2, it only took 20 minutes for it to feel completely uncomfortable on my face. Once I put the Elite Strap on, I was able to leave the headset on for over an hour. What a difference it makes! It really does help to balance the weight off your face. Highly recommend this. I did read that some people have had theirs crack, I've had no issues so far, but I'm also very careful when I take it off. I make sure to loosen it up first. UPDATE: Its only been a month and no matter how careful I was, mine ended up cracking and breaking.

The item arrived on time, no delays. The package was well done and felt very safe for what was inside.Connecting the headset to Wi-Fi and starting up + playing a game was like breeze. There is no detailed user manual but there is a start-up document inside the package. There is a small booklet which explains about the headset but I am not sure if that will help to deal with any problems connecting internet and playing games. Best is to check online as there are a ton of videos and forums.Personally, I had no problem to start up but had lot of issues connecting to a PC. Wireless connection was a little hassle in the beginning, but found resources online.Wired was pretty easy but you need to know the steps to do it, you can find it online too.Overall I am giving it a 5-star rating. The experience is amazing, although it could be a little stressful to the eyes and will get used to it after couple of times.Good luck!!

My strap broke on one arm after 5 month purchase. I contacted the Oculus Support, filled out the form, submitted all the information they required.  After a month of waiting, Oculus Support sent me an email today and it says ""......Based on all the information you provided, we would like your Quest 2 Elite Strap returned for further review and have a replacement Quest 2 Elite Strap sent to you. Note: this replacement may be refurbished. ""It has been a really long process and frustrating experience. The strap was broken within 6 months, and it's been over one month since I contacted Oculus. Now Oculus ask me to return it and then replace it (potentially with a refurbished one) subject to review? and I don't even know when I will be able to receive it!

The strap is extremely fragile

2022-05-21 21:00:44.795201,"
To start off, I want to make it known that the Elite Strap has a well-known manufacturing issue causing premature wear and cracking of the side straps. Oculus has gone so far as to pull the product off the market for a period of time, and extend their warranty to 2 years from 1. You won't need that warranty though, it will crack on you within weeks/months. Oculus tech support will also give you the run around and eventually tell you they have to ""troubleshoot your issue"" to figure out a way to solve it.I actually own of these straps for two different headsets. One strap failed so catastrophically that the plastic was literally crumbling in my hands, and the other side of the strap was also cracking in multiple places. The second strap has multiple horizontal hair line cracks, as well as vertical cracks developing.Is the headset comfortable? Totally, it's far more comfortable than the stock strap, but you're basically stuck once it cracks (and it will). Just buy a 3rd party product, it's way cheaper and it's not going to self-destruct on you, the warranty service will probably be better too. If you still want to buy this one, go ahead, but when it breaks, don't say I didn't warn you.

Product is so bad, I have no idea where to start.1- the device is very heavy on your face. You feel the weight, a lot!2- unless you super tight in the strap, the device will fall. If you tighten the strap then in addition to the device being heavy, your entire head is now tight.3- there's actually no room for glasses in this thing. Even with the glasses spacer, the width is not enough for the glasses to fit.4- The PD is not well adjustable, no matter which setting you pick. You will see a lot of black sides.5- there are crazy Hollow effects and ""God rays"" coming from the lenses, even when you are not using your own glasses. they are worst when you put the in your glasses.6- the LCD seems very poor quality, and the image seems extremely washed out. I have not found a way to fix that.7- coming from a Samsung gear VR with my S9, this seems like a huge downgrade. I will be returning this product.8- bluetooth headphones are not out right supported, enable them in experimental features.9- as others say, the strap brakes fairly easily.

I bought an oculus quest 2 virtual reality headset a month ago and already have skin irritation. The symptoms are clear, I should never have bought this product.These skin irritations left black marks on my skin around my eyes. It was a product that destroyed my life and weakened my self-esteem with these marks on my face.This is a purchase that I greatly regret, the cost of this product is very high, the majority of applications are paid or free applications as a short demo.Unfortunately, I expect the company to offer a better quality product that is good for both mind and body.My personal opinion is to avoid this product if you want to protect your skin and your wallet.

I wanted to like this very much. I did a lot of research beforehand and after i got the quest 2. But despite its nice packaging and relatively slick initial startup to get you playing, there were some deal-breaking flaws.In a nutshell: the sweet spot for visual sharpness is too small. What i mean by that is if you put the headset on, you have to make 100% certain that1. The ipd (distance between the lenses) is set properly. I ended up having to set it between the second and third longest setting. Though I simply couldn’t find the perfect spot2. The the straps have to hold the headset perfectly in place on the x-y plane in front of your face. Not too far left-right, nor too far up-down.3. The strap has to be tightened a lot to ensure that the unit doesn’t move. You can’t even sneeze cuz you’ll lose your sharpness sweet spot. And you have to reef on the straps to bring the device closer to your eyes also, to maximize sharpness. I had to have it so tight that i had welts on my face for an hour after taking the device off.4. If you use glasses, forget it. Even with the spacer, the device wanted to ram my glasses into my skull. The optics just wouldn’t align properly if i used my glasses.With that said, the fiddling with the device was too much. And it ends up being too uncomfortable for me. It actually hurt. Not only that, but it made me nauseated.Lastly, i tried a game via Steam VR. I found the graphics to be very poor compared to my laptop screen. I’m using a laptop 3080 rtx so it def has enough power. I just found the vr screens to lack visual clarity and fidelity… it just seemed washed-out or sparkly and strange.Overall, it was easy to setup, had great tracking and a generally slick interface. But the discomfort, poor graphical prowess and tiny sharpness sweet spot destroyed the experience for me. I actually dreaded the thought of having to use this thing.

Bought February 17th and is now in the garbage on April 8th. Less than two months of use. The side plastic support strapping that extends along the side of your head cracked and eventually snapped in two. I pieced it back together and used gorilla duct tape to re-secure the side strapping. Worked temporarily until another crack developed and snapped. Got popscicle sticks to create a splint over the broken area then re-taped with gorilla tape. Last night the round cap at the back of the head strap that cups the back of your head snapped off on one side. Tried super gluing it back together. Now the tension crank handle at the back won't turn. Found it a new home in the trash bin. I am retired and only use the device in a sitting position to play PokerstarsVR, so it's not like I was doing any wild shootemup games or sword play daily.

So to begin, I'd like to say the Quest 2 is quite a blast and that Meta is literally selling the hardware at a loss due to hoping to hook you on the product in the long run.That being said it has a number of flaws, the biggest of which being that you need several other devices to make the Quest 2 as useful as it can be.To begin with, if you want to play any games that connect to your VR computer to enhance the experience, then your going to likely need a separate and long high Quality USB wire to connect to your computer.  That's $30.Then your going to want to buy some rechargeable AA batteries and a charger if you don't have one for another $30 for the Controllers.Finally you;ll really need a much better strap than the default one, the Elite Strap is an option for $55, but I prefer the M2 Pro which cost me $70 and came with an additional battery to extend it's life.  Finally you'll really want a sweatband for any active game otherwise your sweat will cause you to stop, which you can get for $5.That all amounts to another $130 CAD, and the quest starts at $450, although if you bought during sale like I did you got a $70 discount.  But even with that included I spent over $500 on the Quest 2 all in all.That being said, comparing it to it's direct comparisons such as the PS5 and such, I do feel that the Quest 2 is different enough to be preferable if that's it's direct competition, especially with how amazing Beat Saber is, and the fact that exclusives are getting less and less important, and I'd also rate it above the Switch personally although those are harder to compare, as the Switch is designed for outside use VS Quest 2 which is strictly indoors.That being said, if it's competition is something like getting a better computer?  Such as you not having a good enough computer for VR to begin with?  Then I suggest you invest in just saving the money until you can afford a better computer to be honest, especially if you also use said Computer for gaming.Overall I think I likely should have saved for a new computer myself, but I didn't realize the accessories needed or the sunk cost fallacy, but overall it's not a big loss and I'm quite emotionally satisfied regardless and it has gotten me a fair bit more active.

Cons :- not impressed by image quality- image quality deteriotes when you don't look in the center of the ""screen"", you have to move your head, not your eyes- the ""sweet spot"" where you need to be looking on the lenses to get the best image quality is very small- headset is relatively heavy and does not breathe that well, it seems the solution would be to put all the hardware (CPU, etc) somewhere else (in a backpack, in a pocket or let's do the processing remotely on a PC)- I tried to play Squadrons on my PC, I had to install SteamVR, go through a few not so obvious steps, then I learned that the Oculus controllers are not supported by this game so you must use a joystick or keyboard/mouse, not really impressed- no demo as part of the setup to let you try a game but I was found a free game that pretty much does that : Echo VR (also owned by Facebook)- the Echo VR game was relatively great but I had ""mild motion sickness"", similar to what I get when I go to the theme park to try ""spinning rides"" with my kids- needs to be linked to a FB account for no logical reason- I was not able to receive sms from FB to verify my FB account to unlock Developer Mode for some reasonsPackaging cons :- does not come with a case- it does not come with headphones, only built in speakers, you can add your own but I would have preferred that Oculus/Facebook at least sell some headphones designed to fit the headset- elite strap not part of the kit (I mean it's great to have options but it would be best to have a better level of comfort by default)Cable cons :- it includes a usb 2 cable while their own software recommends a usb 3 cable ...- included cable is very short- official usb 3 cable is quite expensivePros :- got 35$ oculus store credit from being referred by a friend (he also got 35$)- I tried hand tracking, controlling the device without controllers, it worked relatively well- I tried using my computer by plugging a usb 3 cable in the PC, I was able to see my Desktop, relatively cool as an experiment but at the same time, it just look better in real life so why bother- it was fun to see the kids trying itTLDR : it looks more like a demo product to me, I think it still needs to be improved to be a great alternative to non VR gaming, it's not enough comfy nor impressive to make me want to spend time using it instead of doing other activities

I bought another chinese version of the same idea and it was trash. The fit was wrong, it didn't block light. It didn't include anything but the rubber itself. This kit includes 2 sets of both foam and the rubber light blockers plus the eye rings - and they are awesome. Was foolproof and took like 2 minutes to put everything together. Added bonus my wife and I both prefer a different interface (that you're buying here) and we can swap them when we swap the headset and no one has to deal with the other's sweat.I understand wanting to save money and buying cheaper - but on amazon cheaper almost always means inferior.

 👍🏼Pros:✔️Gets your Oculus up off the desk, couch or floor✔️Very simple to install (took me 5m)✔️Thr LED lights add a nice touch✔️Comes with a guide for the nail markers👎🏼Cons:❌You must plug the magnet into the Oculus USB port, which is fine if you never use the USB port on your Oculus. However, my son likes to use the Oculus for Roblox so he needs to unplug the magnet from the Oculus to plug it into the PC. The magnet is very difficult to get out of the port on the Oculus. Not a deal breaker by any means, but just something to be aware of.❌This mount slips off the screws when you pick up the Oculus off of it, sliding off of the wall. I remedied this by using 3M double sided tape on the mount so that it's very secure to the wall with both screws and double sided tape.Overall I'd recommend this mount. It's a bit pricey for what it is, but it's almost a must have if you have an Oculus. The last thing you want is for your $400 machine sitting on the desk or floor. This mount gets it up off the desk and also displays it nicely.

I was hesitant about VR - worried it was a gimmick I'd only use once or twice and then end up on a shelf.Decided to make the plunge when I realized I could purchase prescription lenses to go inside the headset.I wasn't prepared for the absolute Immersion VR provides.  The Quest works great wirelessly (with great Wifi) using Virtual Desktop. Rare glitches are far less annoying than the advantage of being entirely wireless.My eyesight isn't the best, in the real world I have a weak eye and frequently have double vision, but I found the binocular vision I get from the quest to be better than the real world.  That staggers me - I would have never expected that result.I love my quest and use it every day - it's my desktop computer that's been neglected!

This device is basically a data mining device. The only way you can play games on this is basically to have a Facebook account.Look, I don’t even mind website tracking or “selling my personal data”.But when I want to be online, I don’t want to be connected to my irl acquaintances or want my legal name to be everywhere on online communities.Is it too much to ask to keep online and offline separate?But no. Get a machine from a competitor instead of you’re worried about your privacy online.Device itself is okay, not the best, but definitely worth the price. The reason why the price is so low is because that’s the cost of your personal info, otherwise other devices of similar specs will cost quite a few hundred dollars more. It’s also not the most comfortable of devices, so be ready to shill out some more money to make it comfortable-ish to wear.

I knew my son and the fam would love this… I did a lot of research before purchasing and yup!!! So cool… some really cool free games but the good games need to be purchased but it’s worth it… I have anxiety and this helps me to focus on other things and they have some cool meditation experiences which are so cool. I recommend it 100% if you’re looking for something that is really high quality in regards to graphics you may be disappointed but for me it’s perfectly fine… just watch YouTube reviews and make your own decision… it’s sure to “wow” you and your family.

Watching movies in prime is amazing.Cons:Head strap is completely useless. Doesn’t fit at all. You have to shell out more money to buy the better head strapsOculus itself keeps hanging all the time. The device just goes blank at random intervals while playing games. Defeats the purpose of fun.Oculus app is really buggy.

I got this for MS flight simulator. For the first month I just watched all of the videos and games before getting around to the flight sim. Then the fun began. Spent another month getting the flight sim to work with VR, eventually got the Oculus USB cable and now all okay. Flying in VR is amazing, well worth the trouble and cost.Now the cons. Bit pricey but c'est la vie. I got the 256GB vesion but now know that the 128GB would have been more than enough - can always delete and add stuff via a PC. It is a bit uncomfortable to wear for long, maybe an hour tops. Heavy (0.5kg), sits on the bridge of my nose, position matters so can't just move it. Battery life is so-so, so I use a big (26AH) external USB pack.VR is still a bit of a gimicky novelty unless you have specific games or simulators in mind. For example, amazon prime has a VR section - with 14 videos averaging under 10 minutes each inc 3 minutes of credits. Youtube has some too but resolution is almost useless. A good quality VR video will be 0.25-0.5GB a minute. Yes, 1GB might only be a few minutes (depends if 2D-3D, VR180-VR360, 3DOF-6DOF).All that said, if you want VR, don't go cheap, go Oculus or HP.

UPDATED MAY 5 2022 - see the end. We purchased this a month ago. We both love it. Then after an update the right eye piece failed to work. Rebooted, both hard and soft, did at least 6 factory resets but nothing worked.  We were able to log onto the chat (and after being dropped 2 times) and uploading a video of the unit not working (along with the particulars such as Serial numbers etc) just to be told we would be getting a replacement.  We were adamant that we did NOT WANT A REFURBISHED UNIT  as this was just a month old. The staff were excellent so I can’t fault them - but the company’s policy sucks.  We were recommended to get a refund through Amazon.  Nope they don’t refund things like this. Back to oculus for the refurbished unit. Sigh.  I’m starting to think oculus only replaces with refurbished units because they know of the glitch in the new original units. Admitting to said known glitch would mean a recall of extraordinary magnitude. This way they get the bad units back, send out a fixed previously bad unit to the customer who’s returned unit will be fixed sent out to the. next weary customers.  It's way cheaper than a recall but long after the sweet taste of saving a buck comes the bitterness left behind from your customers dissatisfaction.  We have long memory’s.  UPDATE - I have increased to 3 stars from 1.  Our replacement unit FINALLY arrived - Thank you.  We were delighted to have received a NEW REPLACEMENT UNIT (not a refurbished one - as far as we can tell).  So far, it is working well.  I will update this again in July or August 2022.

I really, really, really hate the strap configuration that comes with the Oculus 2 by default.As someone whos first VR setup was a Odyssey+, I got very used to the idea of a very solid structured support system - especially with adding after market supports like the Studioform headstrap. The Oculus 2's maze of cheap fabric and velcro always felt like it was horrible, and it was very difficult to adjust.So the Elite strap is a god send - it restores that addition of a solid strap to a VR headset, and offers a built in battery. The battery addition is super convenient too: it plugs directly into the charging port, so when you go to charge the ocoulus, you just plug it into the back of the headstrap where the battery charge port is. Since its a first party product, the oculus natively reads the battery level and will report it in your menus. A solid strap isn't unique to Elite, and the battery addition isn't unique, but to my understanding third party solutions do not give in-app readouts of battery level. This could be wrong, but going to flag this to differentiate why a premium paid for the strap might be worthwhile.That being said, there is something major that must be identified: There has been a historical concern about Elite straps breaking. Seriously, give ""Quest 2 Elite Break"" a google and you're going to find a ton of results. Its pretty consistent that Oculus has been on the ball for replacing strap breaks with absolutely no fuss (and quite quickly), but its a concern that must be flagged. There is some discussion that its quite possible/likely that newer straps are made from a different material combination that means they're less likely to break, but its substantively difficult to tell when straps were manufactured, and there's no publicly facing information saying that they've addressed the issue.An advantage that I personally find is that the elite strap is substantively easier to clean than default straps - outside of the velcro strap over the top of your head, its all hard/plastic material, so you can clean it quite easily. The velcro strap isn't removable, but being a velcro strap its fairly easy to sanitize.In general: Highly recommend it, with a buyer beware there's a historical issue with the straps breaking, but they've been dealt with quickly/without issues in the past.

Found pain along cheek bones no matter where I set the strap. (upgrade is a must to the elite or other offerings on Amazon that use the turn dial adjuster on back)-lcd display has terrible black levels......this would've been an incredible experience if it was OLED.-foam around vr will soak up sweat but is much more comfortable than the silicone.....this is another upgrade point for comfort....go for the ventilated option using the pleather material IMHO.Overall, after performing the couple comfort upgrades, I am very happy with this unit and would consider another one.

Quest is a nice headset & an amazing VR experience. The games are real fun & enjoyment for the whole family. The set is a bit heavy so you may feel a bit of pressure on your neck after 30 minutes of play, so keep turns short & those neck massagers handy.The worst part of the experience is the facebook account needed to use the headset. Basically, all your purchases are locked in with facebook account. There is no point of linking a social media account when you just want to enjoy games.  And who in their right mind will share their personal info and purchases with facebook, who are proven to sell your info to third parties.So, there is always a sword hanging on your head that if facebook decides to suspend your account, for any stupidest of reasons, you will lose your occulus account as well, with little to no reprieve. This is such a shame.Cannot think of any other product out there which has such limitation on their consumers. They really need to jot down a predictable way to sort out account issues so you can retrieve, transfer or moneyback your purchases (which can end up in hundreds of dollars)

I wasn't sure what to expect from such an inexpensive VR headset but i've been amazed at how polished the experience has been so far. I mostly wanted to use it for PCVR with Steam and originally bought a USB cable to tether it to my PC, but i soon realized the performance was not as good as expected on my older system (3930k / GTX 970) I then tried air link, and the experience wasn't much better, despite my high end network and wifi. I was able to get a very good wireless experience out of SteamVR after discovering VirtualDesktop for Quest2 however, it's an elegant solution that delegates a lot of the networking workload to the headset itself, freeing your PC to focus on the games and it's been wonderful so far. I was able to play Beatsaber on my PC at a very respectable 60-80FPS without too much input lag. VRChat was also playable even at low 30-20fps, it's not a bad experience if you mostly hang out with friends in private worlds.Do yourself a favor through, buy an upgraded head strap, the default offering is terrible for large head and will be too tight and front heavy.Finally, i was skeptical of buying a FB product due to privacy concerns, but if that bothers you, a separate FB account exclusively for your Quest2 is a good workaround until Meta goes through with removing the FB account requirement to use this headset.

59 years old and tried VR for the first time at a games room restaurant.  They had a vive pro 2 system and it was fun,  but glitchy on a simple program.  Still enough fun to make me want to check out others.  I settled on this one as most reviewers seemed to favor it.  And for the money,  this is better than the experience with the vive.  Clearer image,  great game play, easy to use and you can still connect with a computer for even more apps.  10 times less than buying a vive (with the required gaming computer).  However, you have to add the cost of a case and the elite headstrap with battery, about an additional $200.  If you are looking at a vr set, this might be your best bet.  So far, I am very happy with the purchase.

I noticed a crack starting just 17 days after the (extended) Amazon return window.  The crack is on the INSIDE face, so it's hidden from normal view. This is just from casual use, and reasonable care.Fortunately, Oculus has extended it's manufacturers warranty to 2 years, and a call ticket that I sent in yesterday with Oculus Support has already given me the details for replacement.  I'd much rather a refund though.  I've heard that replacements can also suffer from the same manufacturers problem.  At a rate of one failure every four months, I can only hope that the replacements are eligible for replacements, and that the problems in manufacture are resolved before my 2 years are up.  $80 is a steep price to be a beta tester.

The video quality is very good but not outstanding. The audio quality is also very good but not outstanding.I would say that headset is good value and most people won't be disappointed. I wear large glasses and I 'm able to slip the headset on fairly comfortably with the provided adapter. Battery life is reasonable but if you have a juice pack that will definitely help. The only thing I would have hoped for would be free game demo's to try out before purchase. There is a limited amount of free interactive content, and lots of non-interactive. The overall build quality is pretty decent and I suspect that Meta probably doesn't make much or anything on the headset, it's hoping for domination of the industry I suspect.

As you will see if you look online this strap is very susceptible to cracking. I am 32 and the only one who uses the headset. I am very careful with putting it on and off and always hold it by the top strap or the headsets front. Never grabbing the thin sides of the Elite Strap and yet still it has only lasted four months before cracking. Do not waste your money, buy the ""knock off"" products they seem more durable.

I bought the 128gb model, slightly hesitant that maybe I should have forked over the extra cash to upgrade to the 256gb model. I'm no longer concerned about it. After having bought and downloaded a dozen or so games directly into the Quest 2's memory, I still have over 90gb of storage left.  Don't sweat it if you can't afford the memory upgrade. Unless you're buying a ton of stuff off the Oculus store, it's unlikely that you would need more than 128gb.Very happy with this purchase.

Bought the Quest 2 after years of waiting on the VR scene. Definitely lots of fun to use. I bought it without any accessories (no halo strap or extra battery) and I find that the battery life is more than enough for my personal usage such that my eyes will fatigue before the battery drains. My only complaint is that while the strap is comfortable enough, the face cushion is very stiff and is a bit sore on the head.

Came with the tip bent, I didn't think much of it but while using the link if I tugged the line at all it would disconnect. Due to this, I tried to get it replaced. The replaced copy came in proper condition but after a month of use windows started saying ""power surge detected"" and it promptly stopped working.The replacement copy that I sent back got sent back so now I have two extremely expensive cables that don't work properly.The cable also tends to coil, pinch and bend a lot which sucks for a cable attached to your head while you move around in VR.I have worked with audio equipment before and know proper cable maintenance but even with proper care, after a month of use, I still can see damage building up. It was not enough to cause my issues but even if the cable worked properly I don't think it would last long which is ridiculous for a cable of this price.

Anyway the strap arrived quickly and packaged nicely, I swapped it onto my Quest 2 and it was fantastic and much better than the stock strap. I spent quite a few hours in it on multiple days with no real issues for two weeks and then I noticed a stress crack on one of the arms, and then it finally split in half a little while later. Maybe the unit I received was from the earlier pre fix production or maybe the production issues haven’t been fully resolved...(🤷‍♂️)...either way EPIC FAIL

I wanted something to get me experiencing some VR finally. I'm sure there's better units out there but for the money you cannot go wrong with this unit. That being said its not perfect. You definitely want to get an Elite Strap of some kind, but since the Oculus ones are defective as far as I know, there are plenty to choose from on Amazon that work just fine.Also if you plan on playing with the link cable, its easy to put stress on the USB C port on the Quest 2 itself. So try to tape or zip tie it to the head strap, giving plenty of slack at the port itself. And however you anchor it, make sure its tight enough so if you do step on the cable or yank it during use, the stress is on the anchor points and not the USB C port. Mine already got a bit loose compared to what it was day one. Its fine for now but I haven't seen any videos about repairing it so you may get stuck to buying a new Quest 2 if it is beyond damaged.I've read as well that games bought from Oculus for Quest 2 are somehow attached to that specific headset so if you do end up getting another one not sure you'll have access to the library. Another reason to take care of the headset as much as you can.Overall I am more than pleased. Airlink feature works well enough to allow PC Linked games to play without the link cable. The minor stuttering I am happy to deal with when playing something like Lone Echo where you just want to spin around in your office chair full 360 degrees without worrying about the link cable. And there is a ton of Quest 2 stuff that can load right into the headset that doesn't require a PC to play.

I was happy to see this unit comes with a Amazon credit at Black Friday sale. To be fair, VR was way overhyped back around 2015 and to play any graphics intense games you would need a $1000 level VR set and $2000 level computer which is not for most people. I am glad to see this unit has only been at $400 and does not require a PC. But in that regard, you would need to keep your expectations low.

Once you've been playing VR for a while, you will begin to realize the worst thing about it is the inconvenient. It's inconvenient to remove and put on. It's not a difficulty thing, it's just a pain. This strap is the first strap I've bought that actually fits comfortably on the base of your skull, with a gentle give for comfort. The best part is that this same flexible ""cup"" is suspended, so it's free to slide out of the way easily when you slip it on and off. I don't much like the original fabric strap, but it's clear that that strap holds the same theme: quick on and quick off.

I find this strap really stabilizes the Quest 2 VR headset.  If there is a downside, you have to be careful how tight you tighten it because if it's too tight you may get a sore back of the head which can induce a headache.  It's all trial and error but the strap is easily adjustable so you can find the right tension for you.  It is still very stable with a much looser tightness of the strap for me.

Also the hands don’t charge so if they die on me, I guess I will have to figure that one out.  I also wonder about storage space on the device, but we haven’t used up our space yet.  So far I rate it a 4/5.

A great entry level VR headset.Pros:- stand-alone with good games-128gb base version, previously 64gb- wireless air link plays pc vr games well over 5ghz wifi 6-wireless-priceCons:- blurred peripheral- facebook login required (heard this is being removed?)- battery life ~2-3 hours- audio quality- head strap isn’t great (I think it’s ok but some people hate it)- inside out tracking can lose the controllers when reaching too far back- limited inter pupillary distance settingsI play in a 6x8 ft space and rarely need more space. The wireless air link works well with no major lag using a 5ghz wifi 6 router in the next room over.I am able to wear glasses with the headset without the glasses extension but find it a snug fit width wise. I have ordered a pair of prescription eye pieces to try out.Overall very happy.

This is my first ever VR headset and I was amazed at the most little things that I did on it. I played games like Rec Room, Help wanted and loved every moment of it. It was an amazing experience for the first week but then I started to notice performance drops and network connection drops. This mostly happened within the quest 2 software. I tried quest link but it was slow because of the cable and laptop I had so I just decided to play on it standalone. I also hate the very low resolution of the quest 2. I know it is running standalone and it could look a lot better using a pc but the resolution is very bad. I'm sadly going to return this VR headset. I really loved it but I can't keep playing with such low resolution and uncertain software. Rec room is a light game and it didn't go well on the quest 2 because of the bad resolution and random lag that happens here and there.

The product is ok for the price but I have a big head so my glasses won't fit in there, the problem is that I have astigmatism which cause some parts of the images to be blury if I don't correct my vision with contact lenses or glasses, so I would have to wear contact lenses to see well which I don't have. My facebook account won't register and would freeze trying to login to the meta worlds, so because of those issues, i returned it.

Overall it is nice. It creates a virtual world for players. But there are some disadvantages. First, people will feel uncomfortable after they wear the headset for several hours. Second, compared to switch or ps5, the game on Oculus is fewer and more unitary. In addition, the battery time of Oculus quest 2 only lasts around 2 hours, which is too short. I have to say now I rarely played Oculus in my free time.

It was a terrible way to start VR. On the set up screen after turning it on for the first time all I had was a frozen screen. There was no troubleshooting I could find online that could fix this. It took 3 weeks for me to receive the Oculus Quest 2 in the mail so I didn't want to wait another 6 weeks for a new one. But I did find a work around; I kept pushing the power button on and off quickly to see where my oculus touch controllers' are in the screen. It wasn't easy as I had to keep using references of the last location where my oculus touch were and the clicking sounds of the cursor moving over selectable options so I was essentially blind as a bat during the entire set up process.But after finally getting all the set up finished while blind the Oculus Quest 2 functions just fine without a frozen screen and I no longer needed to use the power button to see the last location of my oculus touch controllers are. This product could have been 5/5 stars but because of its Facebook requirements and the frozen first time set up screen it can only receive 3/5 stars from me. It works but the set up requires a very tricky work around.

Edit: Oculus replaced the strap with a new one,  so that's nice, and we will see how long it lasts. However, my off brand cable no longer works, even though it was perfect for a while. I charges still so there is nothing wrong with the cable or port, my guess is they have some kind of proprietary lock out to prevent you from using an off brand cable.Product broke - seems to be a common issue. Perhaps there is something wrong with the plastic or design but It just cracked without me doing anything to it. I hope I can find an after market one because this cost a lot of money and honestly should have come with the headset to begin with. I hope they will refund me, but I doubt it. I will update if they do.

Quest 2 review (as of Quest 2 software v23):As far as VR goes, the quest 2 delivers. Image quality is great, and the included speakers do a great job. The controllers feel great, and the experiences are simply immersive to a point where it almost feels real.This is it, VR is ready for the masses. The Quest 2 is the most affordable one, and if you can get past the mandatory Facebook account issue, the Quest 2 is an awesome experience.However, it's not perfect. My qualms right now are twofold:1. Microphone doesn't work with PC VR link. It's been 2 months since launch and it's not fixed yet, that's 1 star off the score.2. The included strap is indeed pretty bad. You'll need the elite strap, so be sure to prepare to spend some more cash...Elite strap review:A must have if you buy a quest 2. The basic strap will become uncomfortable in about 20-30 minutes, completely unbearable of you're intent on playing a long session. This ""elite"" strap should be the one included with quest 2. Its fine, not extraordinary. It does it's job.

It's a pretty good case, it's fairly small and can perfectly fit the Quest 2, its controllers and even an Elite Strap if you buy one. However, any other accessories you may have and there's a good chance they won't fit here. I, for example, wasn't thrilled to buy the Elite Strap, so I decided to go with a third-party solution, but very few of them could actually fit into this case - so keep that in mind!

I dived right into VR without ever using it in the past and was very impressed and still am.  without the extra battery strap you will get over an hour of usage with the oculus head set.  For newbies, that's LOTS.  it will take time to get used to the weight of the vr head set and it takes time to get used to the hand controls.  I would not purchase the elite strap until you find that you are using up a full charge and still want to use it more.  keep in mind that the battery strap will add weight to system and it will take time again to build up your neck muscles so it doesn't hurt using the system.

Don't buy a Quest because it can happen to you too! I should add because Facebook does not allow ALT accounts Oculus specifically warned me not to create one and if I do I can expect both my original and new Facebook accounts to be banned. I should also not buy anything. They literally told me to not spend money and it might be easier to just not use Oculus.

I don't understand why so many people claim you should order the elite strap. I didn't, and the basic elastic strap works great if you set it properly. I suspect too many people set the strap too tight or too loose and never bother to take the time to adjust it.

I love this headset, and would highly, highly recommend it to anyone who is just starting VR (With some exceptions)!The issues I encountered caused a bit of a finicky start up. Additionally, you NEED a facebook account (unless you have an oculus account). If your facebook account is in bad standing, I WOULD RECOMMEND TO STAY CLEAR OF THIS HEADSET!Additionally, the headset only recognized my rear USB ports as 3.0 (even though all of my USB ports are 3.0). If you purchase this with intentions to use it on PC, which most do, YOU MUST have a compatible USB C (USB 3.2 Certified, however you can use as low as 2.0, with degraded visuals/performance) cable, unless you can figure out how ""Oculus Air Link"" works, and you're okay with latency that way. Oculus sells a cable themselves, but it's not cheap.Overall, a great purchase, especially on sale.

First off, this thing is awesome. You can't get a better deal for a VR than this right here. Yes, you have to have an FB account, but to experience entry level and even some mid to high level VR experiences for only 400 bucks AND it's completely wireless? That's amazing!A few things that take the final star away are the comfort of the strap that comes with the console. Very bad, makes switching to other people a pain. The lenses also only have 3 settings for IPD which is kind of important for VR. Thankfully you can kinda get it stuck in between two if it's really that bad for you.Tracking was good, just have to make sure you keep the controllers in front of you and that the room is well lit.

Obviously using a link cable will pro long this and having an extra battery will help too. Id say anyone wanting long play sessions needs either the batter or a link cable of some kind to keep the headset charged.As well as the battery being small the requirement for a fakebook account sucks.

I really enjoy the product it definitely provides lots of enjoyment and it works great. The motion capture on the remotes is flawless. The machine itself works like a dream. Unfortunately the games available are sort of half baked video games that have been adapted for use on a vr system. Most camera functions across several games operate as a 45 degree “snap” rather than a fluid motion. There are exceptions ofcourse but this seems to be the default camera operation.The games available are all essentially the same game; a collection of community based mini games with a shooter, a sword type game or boxing. It seems motion based gaming was innovated by wii sports and since then absolutely no progress has been made. Though this complaint is more so directed at game developers rather than the product.I would recommend this product only if you are looking for a fun, low stakes minigame type of experience.If you are looking for a robust, varied gaming experience this product is not for you.

I didn't have much problems with the original strap, but I'm also used to the weight of the Quest 1.Thought I'd give the Elite strap a try and won't be going back to the original strap now.It takes even more weight off your face and is very easy to adjust.Once adjusted I don't fidget with it like I used to with my Quest 1, just adjust it once and good to go.

If your a person who gets motion sickness , driving in a car looking down etc DO NOT try vr lol used it for maybe an hour over the span of a couple days and was sick for a week. Nauseous all day, head felt like it was gonna explode and just walking or turning my head faster would induce vertigo to the point of running into walls and falling over. Imagine being motion sick stuck on a spinning ride… for 7-8 days. Medication does not help tried it all, you will have to just except your life sucks for a week haha the equipment was awesome but you couldn’t pay me enough to ever put one on again haha

Been wanting to try VR for a while.  Bought a quest 2 128 GB because it is much more reasonably priced than other headsets.  Bought it through Amazon because of their return policy -- if it made me sick, it was going back.  Fortunately, I am not prone to motion sickness and VR is great for simulation games.  Remove 1 star because it currently still requires a Facebook account.  Not sure I will continue to use Facebook, err Meta products in the future, but I am very happy with the quest for now and can wait to see what the future brings for new headsets.

The oculus quest 2 is amazing, I really enjoyed playing and all the awesome games that are on the platform. I used the oculus link which made it possible to play steam games on the quest. The only downfall i have is that i start getting a bit of motion sickness after playing an hour. I would really like to keep this but vr isn't for me as I almost threw up haha. Great tech to own.

Much more comfortable experience and has allowed me to play high-intensive games like Beat Saber for prolonged periods of time.

It's pretty great, infinitely better than the regular strap that comes with the quest 2. A problem is that it starts to hurt when wearing for a while, not particularly great for prolonged play but odds are it'll stop hurting or you won't be playing for that long. the mechanism that loosens and tightens the strap is also pretty loud, and the strap itself feels really fragile so don't be too violent with it.

I have to say, after my first three hours of playing around with the Oculus Quest 2, I’m impressed. I purchased the 128gb version from Best Buy but wanted to leave a review here for everyone to see.Set up is super easy, head strap adjustment is equally easy. Headset feels very durable and high quality. I could go on and on. I have loved VR Since the first time I tried it So this purchase was definitely not a disappointment. My only complaint is it didn’t come with earbuds or headphones. The internal speakers on the headset do not go loud enough to put out enough bass for my taste. I’d love to be able to connect my headset via Bluetooth to my television sound bar but apparently Bluetooth connectivity has been taken out of the menu. I guess I’m gonna have to find some headphones If I want the bass I’m looking for. Updates to come Once I’ve tried the headset with headphones.If you’re trying to decide I’m buying a VR,this one is definitely worth the money. Best part is, you don’t require a PC!

I'm not going to go deep into details like head tracking and tech specs on this review as those are readily  available everywhere. This will be more about my experience with the system and software and user experience.First off, as far as a nice entry level system to get into the world of VR this one is it. Its ability to use it stand alone, or tethered is a game changer, and the price for what you get is more than acceptable. The packaging is well designed and the materials and build quality are quite nice. The unit comes with the 2 controllers the VR unit. the head strap, charging cable, and a spacer for anyone who wears glasses. The head strap that comes with the unit is serviceable, but it's hard to get a nice tight fit and the headpiece tends to slip and slide, especially when moving around a lot. I would suggest one of the first things you do, is get an elite strap, as it makes a world of difference. Especially if you are sharing the system with others as it's can be difficult to adjust the fit with the original strap.After getting everything set up and powering on my unit I ran into the first problem. In order to use this system you must have a Facebook account. Not that big of a deal, but it does mean that everything you do on the unit will be tracked by Facebook. Any movies or games, or even websites you visit will be tracked and we all know how well Facebook respects everyones privacy…The second problem I ran into was trying to set up the wifi. For some reason it would not display any networks that were available and even using the companion app I couldn't get it to connect. After a bit of research I discovered that this is a know problem with a few suggestions fo fix it. I tried a few with no success and eventually the only thing that worked was resetting the system to factory.After that I was up and running and quickly playing some VR games. There are some fantastic titles for the unit available and finding and installing new games was intuitive and easy. Besides the few minor bumps getting everything up and running I was super impressed with the unit and it is amazingly fun to play and use. The Oculus 2 is capable of tethering to a computer to run some more graphic intensive games and Oculus sells a cable, however there are some other 3rd party cables that are around 1/2 the price that seem to work fine. All in, if you are looking to take a dive into the world of VR this unit is the perfect place to start

My son let me try his 64gb unit and I was so impressed that when the newer version arrived I bought one.As the pictures show you I also bought a halo head strap and new facial interface but these are not must buys but I do like both purchases.The vr technology does deliver and is certainly vertigo inducing if not careful.It is worth mentioning that this is not a game console such as we’re used to. I doubt you’ll be buying 10-20 games  for this like you would a ps4 or Nintendo Switch.There are no games like Far Cry or Final Fantasy the hardware just can’t support it.Although an apples and oranges comparison it looks like ps2 or ps3 graphics might be the best if that helps.But what it can do it does incredibly well.Games like Beat Sabre, Racquet Nx, Space Pirate, and others really do envelop you in difference worlds and can give you a real workout.Just don’t expect this to replace a Switch or ps4 let alone the newer consoles and remember you must have a Facebook account

What an absolute marketing disaster.I have no words for how bad this product is.I can only say the following:You now need two accounts to use this device- an Oculus account and a Facebook account.Both of these accounts are forced to use two-way authentication by phone.  If your phone number dies or you get another one, you're screwed.I was with tech support for *hours* trying to solve this problem.  Email authentication is still being figured out.  Terrible product.

While my kids enjoy the product, my experience with their customer support has been the worst I've ever experienced.  I would recommend purchasing this product from Amazon as I'm sure they will offer better service than buying direct, like I did.  We purchased a elite headset with battery and I'm certain hey sent a refurbished unit since when it broke, it was apparent the unit had been GLUED to hold it together.  Getting customer support to even reply was painful.  Finally, they sent a return shipping label, but stated we would likely get a refurbished item and not new.  To this, I complained and insisted on a new unit.  They then changed their tune saying 'of course it would be a new unit'.  We have now returned the unit and have been waiting forever for the exchange.  Again, they will not answer my messages.  When they have answered, they just say they will respond in 3-5 days (which they don't).  The last thing was they made me track down the copies of the shipping label together with proof of delivery from Purolator, which I did.  They have been ""looking into it"" for about 2 weeks now.  Honestly, you shouldn't buy their product.  Wait for a better VR from the competition.

I always make the joke that the Oculus commercials took weeks just to get the actual VR to play the game they wanted.Since I've received the Quest 2, I have found some extreme drawbacks.For positives, if you are looking to simply blow money on a product in which the total amount of games accumulate less of a value than your actual headset, this is for you.That's it for positives, now onto the negatives.""Air Link"" as they call it - is nonfunctioning. Your Quest App will tell you that your PC doesn't meet the specifications, though mine has a 3080 XTREME with a Ryzen 9 5900X.Clearly not the case.You can waste $100 on a cable, just for the exact same outcome.Air Link will make my PC crash almost instantly. No games work / are compatible / are even playable.The Quest 2 is mainly a very, very beginning step into the world of VR.Save your money.Buy a Valve Index.- From somebody who sold their Quest 2, and bought an Index. And hasn't looked back since.

The oculus quest 2 elite strap is a good upgrade for your quest 2, my only problem with it is after 1 hr on it it gets uncomfortable and I have to take it off. you have to be VERRY careful using the strap because it is very thin plastic.

Fun games for all ages and activity levels. Whether you want to sweat and get fit or just curl up and escape the day to day stress for a break this thing has them all. No wires is great. Don't need a gaming computer also great. So far from the few weeks my son and I each got one the only draw back I have found is the battery life is only 2 hours if you don't have a battery pack strap or plug it in while wearing it. Other than that 5 stars for the interactive experience and the quality time we have spent together laughing and playing. Highly recommend

It’s the only USB C/C cable and the only Fiber Optic.  Yes, it performs better than the cheaper alternatives, but the $36 ones still work!

Beware! I am 3 for 3, with receiving a used unit.First of all, there was no cushioning in the shipping box. Instead, it had a single piece of parcel paper, draped over the contents. I just want meta to know how their retailers are shipping their products.This unit is clearly used and scuffed up. It even comes with some free DNA!I don't really feel to keen on putting this on my face.A little history: I have purchased the quest 2 128gb unit 3 times, now, in only the passed month or so, and every single one of them has been used and/or defective. The first 2 units I received were not from amazon, but from another online marketplace, but still through the official oculus store. They were both uncleaned and used and they both had left controller drift issues within 3 days of use, and one had display problems.This is why I decided to try amazon. I thought maybe, just maybe, I'd get a decent, NEW unit. But nope! I guess meta is just selling uncleaned returns, with fresh shrink wrapping.Have a look at my images. I have a couple macro images in there, to show the gouge near one of the cameras. There are scuffs and stains all over it. But the worst part is the nose grease from some unknown stranger accompanied by old dust and who knows what else is in that fabric.In these times, you'd think meta would take better care and clean their products properly. And maybe stop selling used stuff as new. It's bad enough that they only really give you refurbs when you call in a warranty. But now I think the refurb days are over, because my last 3 units were definitely beaten up, and anything but new, and unused. It's just sad when you spend a fortune and receive a used and/or broken product, over and over.

画像の通り、ポッキリ折れました。通常の使用しかしてません。折れた時の状況を説明すると、かぶろうとした瞬間頭にかぶろうとすこし力を籠めたら折れました。使用期間は１か月経っているかいないかくらい。使用頻度は週2，3度程度。もともとプラスチック製で、ちゃっちな作りと取付方法があまりにも力任せな感じだったので細さも併せて不安でしたが問題なく装着できたのでそのまま使用してました。頭の後ろのノズルをまわすと締め付けたり緩めたりできますが、毎回調整するのは手間なのである程度ちょうどいい位置にしたまま頭の装着や取り外しを行ってました。若干力がかかる使い方をしていたのは否定しませんが、こうもあっさり簡単に折れてしまうとは思わず、正直呆然としました。純正ストラップとレンズを安くする代わりに高くてもちゃんとしたストラップを提供してくれると思ってただけに、このエリートストラップもお金をかけて作られているようには見えず、頑丈さもなく、プラスチックなので伸縮性もなく、あっさり折れるというくそ仕様でした。もともと締め付けるように使うパーツなので、きつく締め付ければその分力がかかります。でも力が分散するところがなく、特に細いプラスチック部分に引っ張られる力がかかりやすい構造上の問題で使用者全員そう遠くないうちに全員折れると思いますので、購入はしないことをお勧めします。

1) Overpriced.  I don't care if it's fibre optic, in real world applications I found existing USB leads that work just as well for less than half the price.2) It's USB C both ends.  I believe most people will need to purchase a converter to use on a standard USB A socket.  It wouldn't hurt to include one (especially considering the price point)

Not a great deal i can say about a head strap so just a few pros and the one conPros....Very well made sturdy but of kit.Makes a huge difference to the vr experience on the quest 2.Makes putting on and removing  the headset a lot quicker and easier.Should stay cleaner for longer and easier to clean unlike the standard strap.Cons...Over priced for what basically is a piece of plastic although be it adjustable. No expensive electical components inside, no different sizes or fitment to accommodate, no screens. Just a piece of plastic so no idea how they come to the price tag of 49 quid.

It's a lot better than the Quest1 strap and the cheap one they give you on Quest2. I just wish they put the weight on the top of your forehead like PSVR/Rift-S. Comfort should be before portability especially when all you need is a bigger case to fix the portability issue.The other issue is that the fan is working so hard the vibrations are traveling across the rigid elite strap and into my headphones. I get a constant hum from the fan vibrations.They should of used a vapor chamber or a little bit of copper in the heatsink to reduce how hard the fan has to work. And stop the fan vibrations.

This is one of those things where you get what you pay for. Having bought a cheaper alternative that claims it's ""This is the next best alternative to the official Oculus Quest Link Cable."" I can categorically state that it isn't. In this case there's nothing better than the genuine article.  I know it's not the cheapest but there's a reason for that. If you want to enjoy your expensive Oculus Quest 2 headset on a PC you'll want to get this cable. You can always try the WiFi 6 method but that's another kettle of fish altogether.

I'll start off by saying, I personally thought the original Quest 2 strap was... okay, but I ordered the Elite in advance from watching YouTube reviews.I'm so glad I did.I find the Elite strap to be a significant improvement not only in comfort but stability as well. When I'm playing games like Beat Saber, Pistol Whip or Vader Immortal I move around alot, which made stability iffy sometimes, the Elite strap solves this entirely. Highly recommended.

Se avete soldi da buttare e siete fissati con l’avere tutto originale e ufficiale non leggete neanche quello che sto per scrivere.Consiglio di leggere l'aggiornamento in fondo.Ho aggiunto un secondo aggiornamento in cui ho tolto una stella.Spero questo serva a chi cerca un prodotto di qualità e che non ha voglia di perdere tempo.Materiali:Rispetto alla borsa del primo quest i materiali sono molto scadenti.È un uovo di plastica, non molto rigida. Al tocco sembra un cartone ricoperto di pelucchi di cotone o lana. Saranno gusti ma a me sinceramente non piace per niente, anche per una questione igienica, se lo sporcate dubito seriamente che riuscirete a pulirlo riportandolo all’aspetto originale. In più io ho i classici calli da sala pesi, non vi dico che fastidio accarezzandolo, sentire tutti quei fili che fanno attrito 😒 quasi come sfregare sul velcro.L’interno ha lo stesso stile dell’esterno ma di colore più scuro. Se entra polvere non penso sia facile riuscire a rimuoverla come lo sarebbe su una superficie liscia.I supporti all’interno sono in gomma, ottimo per non graffiare le lenti ad esempio.Il laccio non saprei dire se è pelle vera, non sono andato a cercare, comunque al tatto è simile al camoscio 👍Uso:Tanto per cominciare la chiusura: c’è un laccetto, quello è quello che dovete accompagnare lungo il bordo dell’apertura per aprire la cerniera.I separatori all’interno sono posizionati in modo intuitivo per riporre il visore, tutt’altra storia invece sono quelli per i controller, ok dopo aver visto l’immagine si fa perché c’è il posto ma non c’è quasi niente che li tenga in posizione.C’è abbastanza posto per il caricatore col suo cavo e ospita per costruzione anche lo strip opzionale col powerbank integrato.Estetica:L’unica cosa che mi sorprende della linea di questo oggetto è che in foto viene molto bene, tanto che quando l’ho ordinato non avevo il minimo dubbio che mi sarebbe piaciuto. E invece... ci sono rimasto male.Conclusione: se tornassi indietro non la ricomprerei, sto pensando se sia il caso di effettuare il reso visto il rapporto qualità prezzo pessimo.Aggiornamento:Rettifico, ho fatto bene a comprarla perché purtroppo non ho trovato altre borse in cui la disposizione interna sia pensata in modo intelligente come in questa. Ho comprato anche la fascia Elite e ci sta benissimo.Penso sia una scelta obbligata se vi è la necessità di portarlo fuori casa spesso e soprattutto se si utilizza lo strip Elite.Il mio voto non cambia, non vale 50 euro e non ha senso che una borsa da trasporto non si possa pulire facilmente come la versione precedente dove bastava un detergente e un panno.Aggiornamento 2:per 50 euro un magnete, come in tutte le custodie di qualsiasi dispositivo serio, potevano anche metterlo sul rialzo che tiene fermo il visore per indicare al dispositivo di spegnere almeno lo schermo sapendo di essere chiuso in una borsa/custodia. Ma veramente. Ho tolto la seconda stella.Questa relazione sta comportando più compromessi del previsto 😛

Having read many reviews on here relating to the Oculus Quest 2 link cable, seemly many people don’t understanding or have the technical knowledge relating to dual function data and power transfer cables (not surprising really as the cable connectivity world has become utterly mind boggling)  and whilst I’d agree this cable is on the expensive side its actually totally designed to do the required task, but moreover and I feel it’s important to understand, this expense is because active cables (active cables support much longer reach than their passive equivalents), cables capable and used for both data and power transfer are far more expensive to produce than passive cables (passive cables are liable to degrade data they carry).This branded 5 metre (16.40 feet) of premium spiral shielding fibre-optic core link cable delivers exceptional performance for PC VR gaming on your Quest 2 whilst powering up the headset.  It’s lightweight and highly flexible in comparison to many of the unbranded cables available, many of which also do not offer charging capabilities.  I also found no channel impairments including attenuation, crosstalk, noise, irregular fluctuations, minimal signal loss and group velocity distortion with this cable.With Oculus ‘O’ branded high-quality link cable and the Velcro hook and loop fastener, Quest 2 feels and acts like a proper tethered headset, like it was meant to be used this way. Your computer requires a USB-C port providing sufficient current and you’re going to need USB 3 – C adaptor (which is not included in the box) if you don’t have a USB-C port. This link cable came nicely packaged in an Oculus branded box, and email order information and service by Amazon was highly professional and premium delivery swift as ever.So in conclusion, I feel this is an actual case of paying more for something, but in every sense getting what you paid for, offering blistering-fast data speeds while powering the headset at the same time, and being one of the longest USB-C 3 cables, therefore allowing you to move freely to every corner of your playing space. I’m therefore happy to submit this product review and recommendation to fellow would be purchasers.

If you own an Oculus Quest and a gaming PC then chances are that you might have tried out Oculus Link. I've used a selection of different cables with Oculus link with mixed success, some of the cables are too thick/heavy, some are too short, some have a USB repeater halfway through or some of them simply don't work properly at all.Being an Oculus genuine product I had little doubt that this cable would work but it is very expensive. It's unlike most other cables out there in the sense that it contains a fibre optic inside for the data so it should make the cable much lighter. It's a little thinner, lighter and more flexible than some of the other cables I own but you can't tell there's a fibre optic in there. You do need to be careful not to bend the cable too much though because that may damage the fibre optic inside.One thing that to bear in mind is that this is a USB Type-C to USB Type-C cable. Annoyingly Oculus do not provide a USB Type-C to USB A adapter with the cable which is actually outrageous at this price point! A lot of people's front USB ports on their PC are USB A and not USB Type-C, I only have USB Type-C ports at the back of my PC which means losing a metre or so of cable. I had to buy a USB Type-C to USB A adapter (ASIN B083DS8GDH seems to work).Being able to play PC VR games, such as Half-Life Alyx or Asguard's Wrath on the Oculus Quest 2 is amazing but going back to the cable is a little immersion breaking. However, I have found using this cable to charge the Quest 2 whilst playing slow paced games like Walkabout Golf or Pro Putt works well and doesn't interfere with the gaming experience too much.One thing many users don't know about is an application called Virtual Desktop which can be side loaded on the Quest 2 and allow you to play PC VR (i.e. Steam) games over 5Ghz Wireless to to your PC. I always suggest checking that out. There's a bit of config to do and it's not perfect but it's definitely a step in the right direction for wireless PC VR gaming.Pros:- It feels decent quality- Works well with Oculus Quest 2 and Oculus Link to PC and is more reliable than other cheaper cables I've tried- Can be used to charge the headset whilst playing Quest 2 games- Slightly thinner, lighter and more flexible than other cablesCons:- Expensive, like other Oculus Quest accessories- No USB Type-C to USB A adapter supplied

I should have read the reviews before I bought this however, I was a fool and thought to myself ""This has well over 14000 ratings, and 4 and a half stars, this should be perfect"" I was wrong.I would kind of understand of it broke whilst doing something extreme like wild head movement or dropping it, but for me it broke as I looked down to pick something up in VR, almost had the headset slide off and hit the floor before I caught it.The second photo shows the aftermath of trying to remove the strap from the headset, which I was trying to be as gentle as possible not to break anything else since removing the strap seems like it was made to be the most difficult thing.

Used this for about three weeks and then, when inserting a headphone plug and holding the Quest 2 by the strap, the strap snapped.The plastic the strap is manufactured from very brittle plastic.  The attachment point to Quest 2 is structurally a vulnerable potential point of failure (it's where my strap failed) as the thin and brittle strap can undergo large bending deformation at the interface to the headset.For me, the strap is a must purchase as it holds the Quest 2 correctly on the head.  Unfortunately, it is made extremely cheaply and a good majority of its purchase price looks to go into the fancy packaging.If buy this strap, handle with care.

Wow so little for so much money. When I bought this I was expecting a decent quality case for money. It's just compressed felt and a little bit of thread where the zip toggle should be. Honestly, there's a bit of string instead of a toggle on the zip. Why? Did they run out of parts? The string gets caught between the 2 halves of the case and you have to use a pen to dig it out before you can open the case. It's an embarrassment for Oculus to be putting their name to this.

This cable worked fine until a month ago the desktop app began saying that I would have a better experience with a USB 3.0 connection (The port I'm using is 3.0 and it was fine up until then). However recently the cable no longer connects my Quest 2 to my PC. Ive tried all the fixes and nothing works but when I use the charging cable to connect my headset it works perfectly. This is painfully overpriced for a cable that breaks after a few months. Buy a cheaper alternative because they are higher quality.Edit : I just discovered that while the cable was working fine with the 90 degree corner plugged into the headset and the straight end plugged into my pc now the cable only works with the 90 degree plugged into my computer and the straight part plugged into the headset. This is incredibly impractical and I have not idea how this is even possible.

*UPDATE - Still under warranty so a replacement is being sent. Still had to jump through multiple hoops to get the end result, including sending back the broken strap. Bit of a pain but at least the customer service was good ...Only purchased this in April and by July both bands on the side of the strap have broken. Not sure why, perhaps from the weight of the device itself. If that's the case then why was this not taken into consideration as part of the design?The strap itself is really comfy but the price is a joke, even more so considering it has broken with moderate use. We don't use it daily and it isn't used heavily or excessively which makes it even more frustrating that it has now broken.Save your money and buy an unofficial one instead.

we already had the Anker equivalent cable but decided to upgrade to the official one as we were getting a new computer and wanted to optimise the VR link.  It worked for about a month then started having problems.  Switched back to the old (much cheaper) cable which worked great (still does).  Tried to return this one and was met with a million technical hoops to jump through.  We aren't that technical but we know that this cable doesn't work, the other cable does, heck even the oculus charge cable works fine (albeit at a lesser connection speed).  I gave up with the support request, and resigned myself to having thrown a lot of money down the drain on this overpriced disappointment.

I’m not going to lie and say I’ve tried loads of straps, I haven’t.  I’ve tried the standard strap obviously and an add on that integrates with that strap to make it more comfortable at the back.  I’ve also tried the Bobomvr (or whatever it’s called) halo strap.  This Elite strap is by far the best one so far.I went for the Bobo halo strap as the first total new strap as I’d heard it takes the pressure off your face.  That was not the case for me at all.  I found the cushioned pad at the back kept sliding up the back of my head and left the full weight of the VR unit on my cheeks.The Elite strap is really easy to get on and adjust, takes about 5 seconds to get it right.  It does not take the pressure totally off your face but it is significantly better than the others in terms of comfort.  I have seen stuff about it cracking and breaking but, touch wood, it’s been fine so far.  I’ve been very careful though about loosening the top head  strap before untightening the main strap to ensure I’m not putting pressure on it.It’s expensive for what it is but I’m very happy with it so far.

Its a lot of money, more fool me for buying it, cheaper ones available. Check you have the appropriate connections. So far seems to be of little real use. It connects the Oculus Quest 2 to my PC when you've downloaded the app. Like the Quest it comes with little in the way of helpful information. Found out about the app by doing an internet search.  I've yet to find anything that makes it worth buying in the first place. VR content appears linked to individual sites like Steam. You have to have bought the game there to play in VR.

It's not much more comfortable than the basic strap that comes with the Quest 2, I thought it would help relieve the pressure on my checks and forehead, but it does not.

Ho usato il quest 2 fino ad'ora senza sfruttare bene le sue potenzialità.Con questo cinturino elite è tutta un altra esperienza, sembra di non indossare nemmeno il visore. Il peso è molto più distribuito e la visibilità è perfetta, non bisogna più star lì ogni due minuti a regolarlo di nuovo per vederci meglio. E' un must per chi possiede un Quest 2. Non mi spiego il prezzo sinceramente data la scarsa qualità del materiale, banalissima plastica che sembra anche abbastanza poco resistente.

3 stars not 5 as this should come with the headset as standard. The developers must have known the discomfort of the original headset and strap when it was tested, the strap it comes with is too uncomfortable to wear for more than 20 mins. Consumer shouldn’t have to cough up another £50 on a product already costing £300 minimum, just to play the £300 product. Plus you have the games on top as let’s face it everyone wants Beat Saber.Aside from the above points, the elite strap is very well designed and a necessity.

Coming from an original Oculus Quest I found the basic strap on the Quest 2 to be a massive step down. I simply can't get it comfortable and have to keep readjusting it and it also catches on my ears and irritates them too. If you're constantly have to fiddle with the headset during a game then it's breaking the immersion.It's clear that Facebook have reduced the cost of the headset to appeal to more people but have cut some corners to achieve this. They also charge a lot of money for the accessories, so this Elite strap is about £50 and the Oculus Link cable is about £90.This Elite strap does transform the Quest 2 into a more comfortable device and allows you to balance the weight a bit better. The headset itself is still heavy due to the battery etc. but this strap does help to negate that. The adjustment wheel on the back makes it much easier to adjust and less fiddly than the basic strap.It is perhaps a little expensive for what you actually get but it does improve the comfort significantly for me. The Oculus Quest 2 paired with this Elite Strap is still £50 cheaper than an original Oculus Quest was though.

This does provide a more comfortable and secure-feeling fit than the standard strap. By cupping the occipital part of your skull, it does take some of the front-heavy feeling from the Quest2. It's quite easy to fit too, taking only couple of minutes.With that said, there are a couple of negatives. The more secure fit means it's a bit more fiddly to quickly put on or take off than the simpler straps since you'll need to tighten and slacken it as required. The other is price - almost £50 for this is a bit of joke.

Save yourself your time and money, and go with a third party headstrap.I waited a couple months for them to sort out the issues but still ended up with it breaking after using it a handful of times. Oculus was well aware that these headstraps were garbage but didn't recall them all. Don't bother trying to get a ""good batch"", they're all trash.

Headset (mine with elite strap) fits perfectly as you should expect ditto for charger and cable.  Controllers I'm not so sure about.  There does seem to be a special way to place them in but not convinced I get this right every time however they stay in place regardless.  I returned my first one after receiving a flattened box and thinking it looked damaged (the lid did not look a good fit with the rest of the case).  My next one looked exactly the same so I supposed that was what they should have looked like.  Really overpriced for what it is but everyone seems to be following Apple's lead on that!

I expected more for the money. To be honest if it wasn't for the fact I wanted to use a set of PSVR headphones on it I'd have kept the default strap. I also must have a funny shaped head, as I find the lower rubber ring part in the back digs into the back of my head and neck and becomes uncomfortable after a while! I wish they'd just used a strap like on the Quest 1. After all if it ain't broke. Don't fix it!

This is far more comfortable than the standard strap that comes with the Quest 2. However, if it just had a weightier back end, which balanced out the front end weight of the Quest 2 , it would be pretty much perfect. That said, it still deserves a 4 star rating as it is far easier to put on and far more stable at holding the headset in place.  16/08/21 Additional:  the side of the strap now has 2 cracks in it, see picture.  Apparently Oculus will replace these FOC, so if they do, I will put the review back up to 4 stars but I have currently dropped it to 2 stars as, after only 3 months, the thing is broken and I use it about once a week.

 Having purchased the aftermarket one’s previously and returned the both, I know it is a bit pricey but paying the extra £20-30 for this is without doubt the best choice. As the pictures show you can fit the elite headset and there is ample room for everything. Good quality case and when spending £300 odd pounds on the device this is very much worth the money, buying both as a bundle with the breakdown care is the best choice. Zip is nice and smooth and all can be done with ease with one hand as shown in the video.Not much to say by way of pro’s and con’s, it does what it needs to and does it very well at that.

I purchased the Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap for Enhanced Support and Comfort form Amazon on 24th November 2020, and the return window was closed on March 1st. However, without me present, I noticed the strap snapped and broke. I was really disappointed because it cost £40 and I expected a good quality product (that's why I purchased the original Oculus one). I checked 10 times, and was surprised there is no serial number on the head strap, the only information written is ""Made in China"" (see photo), which makes me feel I wasn't sold a good quality product (it comes from Oculus though).I need to clarify, I was always careful with the headset, I NEVER dropped it or forced it in any way, and it did not break while I handled it, but while it was sitting on the side. I would like some explanation and I would appreciate compensation/replacement.I changed my review from 1 star to 3 stars because Amazon allowed me to return and get a refund.

Also please do note for your safety purposes please refrain from playing VR while charging it's just for precautionary measure for I care about your safe.In line with that, I would suggest I you want a longer span of playtime, there is an Elite Strap with Battery that serves as an expansion for the battery of the headset.I apologize that we are not able to give you a possible replacement for the issue will always be the same as the Oculus Link is typically not for charging purposes.

Slightly less comfortable than the halo strap of the rift s I am struggling to understand why this is not the default strap to ship with the quest 2.  It feels good but I can understand why they break so easily as you can overtighten this on your face quite dramatically.  Would I recommend it to anyone?  Yes and no.  Yes it does the job and is good, no as there are literally dozens of alternative straps at a cheaper price point that do nearly the same thing.

The elite strap makes using the quest 2 massively more comfortable, I've owned my quest for just over a year now (boxing day 2021) and I had never once played it long enough for the battery to go flat purely because it would get uncomfortable long before that. Now I've got the elite strap I wish I'd gotten it long ago at the same time as the headset itself, because it's completely unbelievable the difference it makes, plus it's much easier to adjust the fitting of this strap in my honest opinion.

Despite there being a lot of alternative cables on the market which claim to do the same thing for a third of the price - I decided to buy the official version because I just wanted it to work properly. I also have a usb C port on my pc so all the negative reviews about it being usb C didn't put me off... Well, even so - it just doesn't work well at all. I set it all up in the Oculus app, but every 5 minutes it says my headset is not connected. I'm sure if I were very technically minded I could troubleshoot and change a few settings and get it all to work - but I'm not, and if I pay £90 for a cable I expect to be able to just plug it in and have it work without hours of faffing and watching tutorial videos etc. to work out why it doesn't seem to work.

I bought this more for the comfort of the strap rather than the battery (though the longer battery life makes a huge difference too). I have only had my Quest 2 a month or two but in that time I struggled to play for more than half an hour because of the throbbing headaches I'd get from having the headset strapped tightly to my face. With this elite strap, that issue has now gone. With the support at the back which moulds around your head and the dial to tighten or loosen the strap you can now easily have it sat snuggly around your head without being too tight, and no more headaches!I would say that this should really be part of the base headset. It's much sturdier than just the strap and the weight of it counterbalances the weight of the headset so it feels much less like it's pulling down on the front of your face. It's a little pricey for what it is but it does make a huge difference.

I'm really glad I bought this case. The Oculus Quest 2 is an expensive piece of kit, and I was keen to get a rugged case that I knew would be protecting my investment. Needless to say, this case delivers the protection I was after. It's a hard shell with appropriately sized compartments to hold the headset, the two controllers, and the charging cable.Sometimes when I'm lowering the headset in, it does feel like the foam surrounding the eyepieces is getting caught on the hard plastic interior of the case, but this is a minor comment.

Para comenzar, mi primera impresión debo hacer hincapié en que la pantalla es pequeña, comparada con las vive. Soy de fusionar la el visor a mi cara, cual careta de buzo (que después de minutos, dejan un tatuaje permanente enrojecido en las zonas de contacto) ello ocasiona que vea los bordes de la pantalla y sus esquinas ""redondeadas"" (entiendo que son bordes tratados por software, para ajustarse a los 3 IPDs). Vengo de una pantalla Amoled, así que pierdo colores sobresaturados pero atractivos y negros negros, bien negros, super negros... no grises... pasar a un panel LCD se nota, colores más pálidos y negros más grisáceos.No obstante, nada de esto es capaz de eclipsar lo bueno. Pantalla casi sin SDE (no comparemos con mis antiguos visores... es una pasada poder leer con claridad sin dejarte la vista en el intento), con una resolucion escandalosa, que en PCVR hace sudar a mi equipo, y en standalone te permite ver una pelicula en netflix, o un video de youtube, con una calidad excelente y sin que te duela la vista.Mi IPD no tengo ni idea de cuanto es, en las vive lo ponia en 63mm, aquí lo pongo en posicion 2 y veo perfecto. Un punto dulce bastante amplio cuando le coges el centro, y con un glare mejor que el de vive. La mejor manera para obtener un buen punto dulce es colocar el visor en la cara, ajustarlo al centro donde veamos mejor, y ya luego ajustar las cintas. Aunque recomiendo el Halo Strap de chinolandia.En cuanto al tracking, hecho de menos la fidelidad de los lighthouses, sobre todo con luz escasa, o cuando se pasan las manos detrás de la espalda, pero los sensores internos de las manos, y las cuatro camaras de las gafas, hacen su trabajo a la perfección. Hasta la fecha no me ha dado ningún tipo de problema en ningun juego.Como guinda del pastel, tracking de manos. En su época fui backer de leap motion, me encantó, a pesar de lo poco práctico que era esa barra metálica pegado al visor DK2. Este tracking de manos, funciona de manera similar (aunque sin sus camaras IR, pero usa varias cámaras para discernir profundidad), no es perfecto, pero es un añadido gratuito que metieron los desarrolladores para sacarse la minga frente a los demás visores quedar por delante de visores más caros y/o modernos. De momento no me ha dado fallos al usarlo y se agradece que cada vez más aplicaciones lo vayan incluyendo como modo de manejo alternativo.Los mandos son excelentes, tras hacerles una cinta al mas puro estilo Valve Index (por supuesto, con coleteros, mas gratis imposible) hacen que la sujecion con mi mano sea perfecta. Me encanta la disposicion de los botones, gatillos y el joystick. Como otra guinda, sobre la guinda, tiene sensores que te controlan dónde pones los dedos y qué presión ejerces en los gatillos. Brutal!La batería me dura algo más de dos horas con los dos juegos que tengo de momento: Blaston y Pistol Whip. No he tenido ningun problema de apagón en mitad del juego, ya que siempre dejo cargando el visor cuando acabo, tarda aproximadamente dos horas en cargar al 100%. Se puede usar cargando, pero no es nada practico. La bateria de los mandos es eterna, dicen que dura uno o dos meses con unas pilas normales. No he gastado ni el 1% en el tiempo de uso que llevo.El sonido es muy bueno. No es tan malo como otros dicen. ¿Por qué? Porque no te anula el exterior, si no quieres. Si subes el volumen lo suficiente, puedes anular el ruido del exterior, pero vas a provocar que TODOS se enteren de a qué estas jugando. Pero tiene un compendio muy bueno entre graves y agudos. Para mi gusto personal, OJO! para mi gusto personal es mucho mejor que el sonido del Deluxe Audio Strap de HTC.Bueno, la guinda, sobre la guinda de la guinda, está en el Oculus link. Ese cable largo, pesado y caro (si no recurrimos a nuestros amigos asiaticos) que te permite convertir un standalone en un PCVR casi en condiciones. Digo casi en condiciones, porque en ciertas aplicaciones o juegos se nota la compresión. Pero con la ultima actualización y un poco de optimizacion manual cacharrera, he conseguido que se vea de escándalo. Cualquier aplicacion, juego, ya sea de oculus o steamVR, se puede jugar con total normalidad.Conclusión a este testamento.¿Me arrepiento de comprar las quest 2 de 256 por algo mas de 400€ gastos incluidos porque vivo en Canarias? NO!!¿Si tuviera 300€ más me compraría las HP REVERB G2? No! no tengo gráfica para tanto. Con la RTX2060 voy raspando en ciertos juegos más demandantes, sin embargo, he tenido que trastear por los ajustes de link para que no me haga mucha distorsion por compresión y poder mantener un buen equilibrio entre calidad grafica y rendimiento.¿Hecho de menos mis antiguos visores? No. Es un salto en tecnología desde que salio vive en 2016. Sin embargo, si tuviera el quest original, quizás si me replanteaba el cambio.Con esto no quiero decir que las HP sean peores. Simplemente quiero decir que para mi juicio éstas cumplen con mis expectativas con creces.

I wasn't sure about spending so much on this strap but it seems well worth it, I no longer have to keep adjusting it to fit different heads and as I wear glasses it's so much easier to put on and remove the headset. Just turn the dial at the back and tilt the headset upwards and it's so easy to lift off.

Perfect for the extra play time and feels just as good as the quest headset, not as convenient as cheaper headsets that can easily slip on and off without having to twist the rear control to release and tighten, this becomes an issue when other people use it, as it cups the back of the head, they risk breaking it by yanking it off, still best option for extra battery

This is a good strap - but I found the cupping straps at the back to be a bit hard and they did cause discomfort. I fitted the rear strap padding available from VR Covers (Gauss Tech) that they produce for the original Quest.The velcro fasteners are not ideally placed, but it stays in place just fine using just the bottom ones and the two together make the Quest 2 extremely comfy.

When I first looked at this item the price seemed a bit steep! It was to accompany an Oculus as a Christmas gift. After already spending £400 on the Oculus itself I was slightly out off spending another £50.However, spending that £50 was worth it as it’s was a great gift. The receiver was able to unpackage their Oculus and put it straight into this case.It’s a high quality item and looks very classy. My only issue was I would of appreciated a picture of how the Oculus went into the case. I did have to Google it!

Bought in January and is used probably 2 to 3 times a week. Noticed that the side straps are made of very thin plastic. After 5 months these have become brittle and you can see them cracking. Today one has side failed leaving a razor sharp thin plastic edge where it has broken. Looks like a few of them go this way. Amazon have directed me to the Oculus support site for any warranty enquiries. Whilst it's a good strap - it's made of very poor materials

£0 for an official cable in an official box, and the cable is not a stable connection. I have connected a couple of times to my Unity developer programme with some issues, but mostly i get a blank screen in the Oculus Quest 2 headset. Funnily enough, Unity is following the tracking of the headset so there is some information getting through, but the important visual information from the computer to the headset is missing. Perhaps 5m is too long for a steady connection but my 2m bog standard cablehas no issues whatsoever other than not being ergonomic and flush with the power insert on the OQ2 headset.

La correa que viene por defecto en el visor a los 6 días ya se está poniendo fea y no parece que vaya a aguantar el año/año y medio de vida que vaya a tener el visor, así que si no es el Elite Strap habrá que buscar una alternativa.Su instalación es sencilla: primero quitamos la cinta blanca grisácea tirando de los laterales y quitando el velcro de un pasador tras retirar el ""antifaz"". Al ponerlo en el Strap nos indican en la parte interna con L y R el lado donde debe ir cada parte y el proceso de montaje es apretar los laterales, pasar el velcro por el pasador y colocar la almohadilla.Pros:✔️ La sujeción es buena y hace que no haya que estar reajustándose las gafas cada vez que se mueve la cabeza.✔️ Aunque se incremente el peso sobre la cabeza, se siente mejor distribuido al apretar sobre la nuca en lugar de la frente.✔️ No molesta en la parte superior de las orejas.✔️ Es de bastante mejor calidad que la cinta que trae de fábrica y fácil de limpiar.✔️ Muy rápido de poner y quitar con el sistema de rueda.Contras:❌Me resulta algo incómodo en la parte de la nuca ya que hay que apretarlo considerablemente para que quede bien fijo y no se mueva el visor.❌ Estaba usando una funda pequeña que tenía de las antiguas Quest y con el Strap ya no me sirve. Aumenta las dimensiones del producto en un par de centímetros.❌ Me parece algo caro y seguramente salgan alternativas que lo superen más baratas. Sin embargo, si hubiese venido de serie y el visor hubiera costado 30 euros más no hubiera habido pegas.Conclusión:Creo que la cinta original prácticamente todo el mundo la acabará cambiando. Esta correa es una buena alternativa si no nos importa que aumente las dimensiones del dispositivo ni que la presión se ejerza sobre la nuca. 4/5Edito a día 23 de octubre de 2020: Está habiendo muchos reportes de problemas de calidad, en reddit mucha gente ha posteado que se le ha roto jugando a beat saber.

I received my Oculus Quest 2 Elite Strap a few days ago and upon using it I've noticed that when it's done up tightly and I unitighten it, it makes a loud pop noise which can get annoying.It just feels as if the scroll wheel on the back is a bit loose.Otherwise, it's great.

For watching movies while laying back and relaxing it's uncomfortable. It sticks out too far and I can't sit back in any chair which has a head rest. This is something I hadn't considered and thought I would let people know.This is a much needed upgrade for stand up gaming with the oculus quest 2. It does feel more secure than the basic strap.Luckily it takes less than 30 seconds to switch the headstraps.I recommend this as an upgrade.

Hi All,I have had a few third party usb c cables that claim to be good for the quest 2 using the usb Type A ports and to be honest third party cables can't hold a candle to the offical oculus fiber optic cable for oclus link.The main benefits are you head set will charge and it will charge fast, how ever you need a REAL usb c port on your computer  NOT AN ADAPTER I do think alot of the issue with people having problem are before there computer is not up to date, mainly there MOTHERBOARD if you have cheaped out on the motherboard in you PC built, you will most likely not be able to use this cable. Only get this cable IF YOU HAVE A MODERN MOTHERBOARD that is decent with usb c ports on the back.Over all I am blown away how good the quality of graphics are now that oculus link are out of beta and the link cable shines, you want PC gaming to be lag free this is your cable handsdown but only if your PC has a USB C port, if you don't have that don't bother getting this untill you upgrade you motherboard or buy a pcie usb c port card.This cable is for people that don't cheap out on motherboards and get the latest IO on there boards.I have also tested this cable out on a macbook pro 16 inch intel in bootcamp windows and works great too.

The elite strap is great in terms of added comfort for longer play sessions. I could barely play for an hour with the original strap due to the lack of support from the back of the head.Due to the multiple reports of the elite breaking, I was hesitant in getting the product, but now that I have had it for a bit it is clear how the design is flawed. Pretty much the main thing to avoid when using the elite strap is do not hinge the strap and headset by grabbing the rear and pulling up/down when putting on or taking off the headset. This will put too much stress on the plastic arms, which have no real strength or reinforcement.My advice is, only put the headset on/off by significantly loosening the strap via the knob and lift off by holding the headset itself. I have been sticking to this and always being cautious on how much stress being placed on the arms and my strap is still break free after months of using it.Other pros:- easier to put on vs original strap- easier to get the headset in the best position for visuals.- comfort- better for holding a link cableCons:- weak design requiring caution and care but can prevent breaks if treated right- can’t really use over ear headphones with the strap

Parto col dire che è un semplice case per il Quest 2, i controller e per altri piccoli accessori che possono essere inseriti nello scompartimento laterale, ed è come me lo aspettavo. Il case è probabilmente più grande di quanto ci si possa aspettare ed al tatto restituisce un buon feeling di solidità: praticamente sembra un grosso sasso vuoto rivestito di peluria. Gli inserti sembrano di alta qualità, e il laccetto per l'apertura non sembra così fragile come lo descrivono. Chiaramente tutta questa ricerca di materiali, design e feeling si paga 49€ (nel mio caso), costo non totalmente giustificato secondo me, dal momento che la scocca superiore risulta essere stata incollata un po' male sul tessuto: il risultato è che, quando chiuso, il case non risulta essere perfettamente simmetrico come nelle foto, cosa che mi lascia l'amaro in bocca. In buona sostanza lo consiglio solo se trovate soddisfazione nel possedere accessori originali, altrimenti indirizzatevi su altro.

I'm sure the cable works fine if your one of the few people that has a USB-C port on their PC. Unfortunately I assumed it would come with a USB-C to USB-A adapter for the other 90% of VR gamers that don't have a brand new motherboards. So I'll havta buy some adapters that claim to be 3.1 and hope for the best since most of them will probably be scams. Oculus really screwed me over on this.

Ce type de sangle rigide est indispensable pour assurer un bon maintien du casque. Le côté très rigide de la sangle permet d'ajuster le casque en le serrant moins sur le visage. De plus, beaucoup de sacoches de transport sont dessinées pour être compatibles avec cette sangle.CEPENDANT, le plastique utilisé pour les tiges latérales ne résiste pas aux flexions et à la force de serrage. En effet, au bout de seulement 2 mois d'utilisation (environ 200h de jeu) une fissure importante est apparue sur la branche gauche (comme pour beaucoup d'autres clients, cf. tous les autres commentaires sur le sujet). La sangle est donc inutilisable sans risque de casse.J'ai formulé une demande d'échange au SAV Oculus directement, qui est assez réactif, et suis en attente de ma nouvelle sangle, en espérant qu'elle soit plus solide, car pour le prix demandé, la qualité n'est clairement pas là.

Very cheaply made. Feels like furry cardboard. There is not a flat side on the entire thing so don't expect it to sit neatly on a coffee table or shelf. The zipper arrangement is also terrible and can easily disappear inside the poorly fitted halves, providing a much unwanted challenge in its retrieval.Can confirm it does offer decent protection and fits the Q2 + elite strap inside with no issue. This is no way offsets the negatives.Instant regret in buying this over priced rubbish. I wish I had gone with litterally ANY of the other case options.

Not sure what the deal with this product is - and alot of online posts seem to indicate others have this issue - but this doesn't seem to work well using it with a usb c to usb a adapter the software doesn't detect the oculus being plugged in - plugging it directly into the usb c port in my pc it keeps connecting and disconnecting - however using a 3rd party cable works perfectly - for the minor benefit of charging while playing at a very slow pace it would be better to look at cheaper options to avoid the headache

値段が高いのは電線ではなく光ファイバのためだと思いますが、1～2千円の通常のUSBケーブルと比較しても体感上の違いは分かりません。速度もほぼ同等です。音楽用のＵＳＢケーブルでも、高価で品質がよいのは光ファイバではなく電線なので、光ファイバにするメリットはほとんど無いと思います。むしろ光ファイバだと足や椅子で踏んでしまうと破損してしまいそうです。また、ＰＣ側はType-Cですが、これは相性がありそうで、私のデスクトップの前面と背面のtype-Cでは認識できませんでした。ノートPCのtype-Cコネクタでは認識できたのでケーブルの不良ではないことが分かりましたが、最初はUSB2.0 0.3GHzで認識されました。これを左右ひっくり返して接続しなおしたらUSB3.0　1.8GHzで認識しました。ただし通常はデスクトップで使用するため、現在はType-Cからtype-Aの変換アダプタを使ってデスクトップのtype-Aコネクタに接続しています。ただしこの場合も最初に数百円の安物のアダプタでは認識できなかったのでCableCreationのアダプタに交換したら認識できるようになりました。結論としてはこのケーブルを1万円で買う価値はありません。1～2千円のPC側Type-Aの電線ケーブルをオススメします。

Akku vom Strap lässt sich nur zu 100% laden wenn das Strap mit der Brille verbunden ist, während des Ladevorgangs.Brille zieht vom Strap Strom, auch im ausgeschalteten Zustand.Also unbedingt ausstecken bei seltenen Gebrauch.Ansonsten ist das Strap hochwertig verbaut und lässt sich gut am Kopf tragen.Vielleicht kann wegen des Ladens und entladens des Akkus ja Softwaretechnich noch nachgebessert werden. Bis dahin gibts nur 3 Sterne.

Basically a waste of money. VR ready PC does not recognise Oculus Quest 2 as being connected - via USB C port which tests ok with mem stick.  Does not recognise headset being connected via working USB 3.0 port with C-A adapter. Get the genuine article they said :(  no Steam yet. Virtual Desktop sideloaded to Sidequest isnt recognising the headset on the wireless network either. Painful process to go through, especially trawling forums for fixes, which this cable was supposed to mitgate.

El producto está bien, ajusta mejor que la correa elástica que viene incluida y es rápido y cómodo de utilizar. Mejora la experiencia de usuario al quedar las gafas más fijas y reduce la pérdida de nitidez que a veces se experimenta con la correa elástica.Pero... lamentablemente se ha roto una de las patas al poco tiempo. No han sufrido ningún golpe, caída ni forcejeo. Debe ser que no soporta bien la tensión a la que es sometida.Una pena, porque estaba contento con el producto.

Es un excelente añadido. Ojalá fuera configuración por default del Quest 2, para no tener que comprar más, pero finalmente comprarlo vale mucho la pena. Añade la comodidad del Rift s al Quest 2 y la mejora aún más. Es muy sencillo de instalar. Simplemente retirar el anterior y aplicar el nuevo con presión, nada difícil. En cualquier momento puedes cambiarlo fácilmente. Vale la pena. Posiblemente lo pudieron haber echo más barato, pero si vas a jugar mucho es un agregado que debes tener.

Aparentemente um produto porreiro, mas após 25 horas uso (33 dias depois da compra), descubro uma estaladela do lado esquerdo.Infelizmente passou o prazo de devolução em 3 dias, senão tinha devolvido.Para minha surpresa após um pesquisa na internet, muitos utilizadores têm o mesmo problema, mas que acabou por partir. Certamente que se utilizar uma vez mais, a faixa vai partir também.Muito desapontado por ser um produto oficial da Oculus e para não falar que não foi barato (50 EUR).Mandei pedido de suporte para a Oculus, e agora estou a espera de resposta. Não faz sentido um produto destes partir com tão pouco uso, e também não faz sentido estar a comprar uma faixa todos os meses.Não recomendo.

Un articolo da avere a tutti i costi se si vuole godere a pieno dell'esperienza di oculus quest 2. Gli elastici il dotazione sono molto fastidiosi ma con questo upgrade si può usufruire del quest 2 senza pericolo di movimenti involontari o senza star li a manovrare i tanto scomodi elastici per sistemare il visore in testa. Questa è la versione senza batteria che ho preso siccome lo uso fondamentalmente attaccato al pc con il cavo, se lo usate fondamentalmente come stand alone o con il virtual desktop, prendete il bundle con custodia e HeadStrap con batteria.Molto comodo, sta perfettamente in testa senza dare fastidio, personalmente lo trovo più confortevole dell'halo strap del Rift s (ma è una cosa soggettiva).Per l'installazione ci vogliono meno di 5 minuti, lo togli dalla scatola ed è pronto per essere installato.Imballaggio super e spedizione prima del previsto.5 stelle meritate.

Il primo accessorio che dovete assolutamente acquistare per Oculus Quest 2 e’ questo cinturino. Estremamente più comodo di quello in dotazione anche grazie alla calottina di gomma sulla nuca, facilissimo da montare, con un po di pazienza e calma. Facile da indossare, evita anche di toccare le lenti con la fronte e comodissima la rotellina posta sul retro per regolarlo a piacimento. Il tutto con una batteria supplementare che, oltre ad allungare le sessioni di gioco, permette di avere un buon bilanciamento dei pesi.Consigliatissimo!Aggiornamento:Dopo giorni di utilizzo tolgo una stella perché esiste un problema di hardware, per ora non risolto dall’assistenza ma noto, che fa scaricare la batteria del cinturino se questa rimane collegata con il cavetto al visore, anche se quest’ultimo è spento! Il consiglio è di scollegare la batteria quando non utiizzate il visore. Purtroppo è un problema che si verifica su tutte le unità quindi non risolvete sostituendola, basta dare uno sguardo al forum di Oculus. Speriamo che l’assistenza fornisca prima o poi una soluzione.

Llevaba unos dias usando el Oculus Quest 2 con la correa que viene de serie y tenia la sensación de que ya funcionaba bastante bien y no había ""mucho motivo"" para cambiarla, lo hizo por recomendación de unos amigos.Una vez llegó ésta, la verdad es que el cambio es brutal, ahora sí que queda absolutamente fijo a la cabeza y es capaz de soportar el peso de un cable si juegas con las gafas conectadas.

The elite strap is definitely a whole lot better than the strap that comes out of the box with Oculus Quest 2 in that, at least, it makes Quest 2 usable without smashing your face up completely. But, it still doesn't quite do the job - for the steep price point, you would expect that it would but it doesn't. Suggest going for a halo strap instead.

I rated this 3 stars only because this carry case feels light and flimsy and leaves me wondering how long the zipper will last positioned where it is, also if the small string attached to the zipper happens to break, then let’s say your up that creek without a virtual paddle,With that said, it does fit the Oculus Quest 2 and both controllers comfortably, although controller positioning is very important to ensure the lid will close properly.There is also not much room for both charger and link cable if you want to store everything in there.Feels like it was designed with functionality in mid but with no thought to material quality and extras that may be needed.To be honest, for the price, it’s ok, but there are better carry cases out there that look like they are built to last with extra storage pouches for not much more than this.The choice is yours

Der Drehknopf zum fester ziehen ist genial.Es hält den Oculus Quest 2 fest am Kopf und balanciert es genual aus.Ja, man muss es zusammen mit dem Oculus laden, aber wie sollte man es sonst tun?Wenn der Saft aus ist (was nicht so schnell passiert), schliesst man halt sein Oculus am Strom an.

Artículo que parece con materiales de bastante calidad, elegante y ocupa poco espacio, pero no es nada versátil.Apto principalmente para transportar las gafas y los mandos con algo de protección si vas en el coche o recogerlas para guardarlas cuando no se usan si es no tienes un soporte para ese fin.Para llevarlo andando o en bicicleta no es cómodo. No dispone de una cinta para llevarlo estilo bolsa o tirantes para echarlo a la espalda estilo mochila, solo una cinta para sujetarlo en la muñeca y eso es poco práctico para trasladarlo.Por otro lado, está preparado para la correa original que viene con las gafas (desconozco si alguna más) pero yo tengo 2 correas más rígidas (una de ellas de batería) y ninguna sirve para este estuche, lo que lo hace un estuche demasiado limitado.

La custodia è carina da vedere all'esterno, ma i pregi finiscono qua.Il materiale è sufficientemente robusto ma troppo sottile, una caduta potrebbe danneggiare qualcosa.La zip è incredibilmente scadente, sembra debba rompersi da un momento all'altro. Inoltre la zip è INTERNA, si apre e chiude tramite un laccetto esterno, il che rende inutilmente difficile la sostituzione in caso di rottura.L'alloggiamento per i controller non include alcun supporto per tenerli fermi. Semplicemente si poggiano in mezzo alla custodia liberi di muoversi.In generale penso non sia una buona custodia.Un prezzo ragionevole potrebbe essere 20€, ma solo per il logo Oculus questa custodia costa 50€.Prezzo veramente ridicolo.

El primer propósito de la compra fue tener mas tiempo para poder utilizar el visor lo cual se cumple muy bien. A pesar de que muchos reviews lo califican como más cómodo, yo siento el strap un poco mas rígido y pesado lo cuál me cansa un poco más, hay que acomodarlo muy bien para que quede cómodo, igualmente según he visto en varios reviews los brazos laterales por ser tan rígidos tienden a quebrarse si no se manejan con cuidado, lo que me lleva a manejarlo siempre cuidadosamente por miedo a que se rompan. Otro aspecto negativo es que aunque el strap tiene su propio conector para cargar, si conectas el link cable para la computadora este no transmite datos es decir no funciona, lo cual me parece mal por que tienes que conectarlo al puerto original evitando que puedas usar la batería con el link cable, solo podrás usarlo en modo air link lo que si no tienes un bien wifi causa respuesta lenta en algunos juegos, ojalá en una versión futura esto pueda ser arreglado, por lo demás lo considero buen producto

Bought this on sale so the pricing was a bit less outrageous. However just keep in mine that buying this official link cable will probably saves you a headache (and some neckpain) since you get the best bandwidth for the task plus the fibre cable is very light and flexible like people said.The MAIN issue is that, this IS NOT the best way to experience PCVR on your quest headset, not by a long shot. I find my performance lackluster while using this cable.I would suggest someone who is aiming to play pcvr to try the MUCH superior method of wireless streaming via virtual reality, it's 80% cheaper, performs better, wireless, and its just mind blowing tbh. Try that if your network can handling it first before buying this cable.I move around alot and live in sharehouses so having this cable as a backup makes sense.

Compré un cable de cobre de alrededor 500 mxn antes de este, no pasó ni el mes y ya se había estropeado el interior del cable, tenía que dejarlo en una posición determinada para que este marcara cómo USB 3 en el software de oculus; a pesar de que el cable fuera super grueso y pareciera de uso rudo, no duró nada. Lo bueno que aproveché la ventana de 30 días de amazon para la devolución del cable defectuoso.Y para no volver a gastar otra vez 500 en algo que probablemente iba a desempeñar igual que el cable anterior, opté por este, hasta la fecha todo bien, no han pasado 3 semanas cómo el otro, pero puedo decir que este durará si no me tropiezo con el, es bastante más flexible y te deja moverte más libremente, lo único que podría cambiarle es que la entrada usb c al oculus es un poco floja, cosa que no pasaba en los cables chinos, pero bueno; mientras no la toques deliberadamente, no pasa nada.

Dicho y hecho, lleva otro plastico para hacer que las gafas estén mas ajustadas, las correas son de calidad, y el montaje se hace en 5 min.La satisfaccion es total, y puedes pasar un par de horas sin dolor de frente, orejas, o cabeza.Las recomiendo si se van a pasar mas de 1h con ellas puestas.No pillé las chinas, porque me comentaron que las correas hacían daño en la sujeción, pero todo es cuestión de gustos.

Sicuramente è più comoda della soluzione stock, ma non di così tanto da giustificare 50€. Scricchiola spesso e volentieri e non da per nulla la sensazione di solidità.Fatta rimborsare, e nel frattempo tengo d'occhio soluzioni third-party migliori.

Ho comprato questo headset a Ottobre 2020, ho utilizzato il visore per un buon monte di ore, ma non in modo eccessivo (4/5 ore a settimana se non meno) e trattando tutto con estremo rispetto (visto anche il costo del dispositivo).Siamo a fine Luglio 2021 e noto una cricca su uno dei 2 braccetti semirigidi, di quelle cricche che solo la plastica esausta può dare.Eseguito immediatamente il reso con sostituzione di Amazon, e in meno di 24h il corriere è arrivato alla mia porta.Vedremo se questo secondo cinturino resisterà per più tempo, magari è stata una delle prime batch fallate, per ora il voto è 2 essendo che altri visori durano anni prima di presentare i medesimi problemi.

Cheaply made, poor quality control. Much larger gap exposing zip on one side. Doesn't appear to be a defect, just high tolerances. Materials feel cheap also.Despite being specifically designed for the quest 2 it doesn't hold it very securely, if you shake it everything will shuffle around.Luckily go it on sale, and it does the job. I'm mostly using it for home storage. It's overpriced for what it is and likely not suitable for someone traveling with their device.

""Is it worth the premium"" is probably what you're looking to answer. After sitting on the fence for a while and using a shorter third-party cable I took the plunge. I think it was worth it. The cable is very good quality, quite light and flexible which helps reduce the drag of being tethered to a PC. Works great as you'd expect but I guess it's a quality of life purchase rather than a necessity when there are other much cheaper cables on the market that will do the job. Still, highly recommended.

Bueno pues llevo 2 meses discutiendo con facebook para que me reemplacen la correa rota, 2 meses. Mi opinion es que os dejeis de tonterias y no compreis esta porqueria, os sale mucho mas rentable comprar otra correa por menos precio que tiene 1000 veces mejor calidad que esto, mejor gastarse 20€ y que te dure 3 meses, que gastarte 50€ que te dure 1 mes y que cuando se te rompa facebook no te haga ni puñetero caso a la hora de reemplazar el producto al que ellos mismo te dan la garantia.

I really wanted an upgrade for the default elastic band on Oculus Quest 2. So bought this without it giving much of a thought. But I soon realised that this product has a design flaw because of which majority of the straps just break. It didn’t take long for my strap to face the same issue.My recommendation would be to go buy any other cheap alternatives of this one. Apart from the design issue this is quite expensive for a piece of plastic.P.S. This does not have any battery pack at the back, this is just the strap.

There are a lot of long USB cables out there, good and cheap, but the fibre optic construction of this cable is fairly unique and usually reserved for professional-grade equipment costing several times more.In the case of this cable, that construction makes the cable much more supple and lightweight, yet capable of great speeds and can positively charge a quest 2 during play. When you buy a cheaper cable you're going to be making a compromise in one or more of those areas.If you only sit to play racing or space sims you might get away with a cheaper 3m cable, or a heavier active cable, but for anything more active or where you're standing that weight of the cable is going to become more of an issue.But the other option to look at is a wireless connection via Virtual Desktop. Because i play a lot of FPS games and don't use stick turning, even the mighty official link cable becomes twisted and loses its length. So now i use the link almost exclusively for seated experiences, and VD for everything else. The best USB cable still has limitations.

The case itself had a hard plastic exterior even though it looks like soft felt in the photos.. and yes the zipper looks quite thin but as long as you don't try to break any speed records when using the zipper it'll be fine.

The USB-C connector at the end isn't properly engineered for this so it bends really easily just by sitting in the headset. It can't support its own weight. The strap tries to mitigate this, but fails to do so clearly because my end is starting to bend so badly its splitting the casing in two. The USB-C cable is the perfect length. I would just suggest using AirLink unless you need less latency and the superior image quality for say Beat Saber. No need to buy this if you're thinking of using it for... adult reasons... 3 stars for good functionality, poor build quality.

The strap works pretty well 99% of the time, however there is a design flaw with the strap. Any bending or especially twisting to the plastic just behind the connector to the headset will snap it with absolutely no force. You need to be careful even when just putting it down.

The head strap sits comfortably when playing standing. The adjustments are easy and also easy to install. The extra battery adds an extra hour or so of game play. I’d say it’s only average.As for what I didn’t like, it’s really not well thought through. If you have to check something like quickly looking at your phone or check the surroundings for obstacles, you need to unhook and readjust the whole thing again. Also, if you have some games such as guided meditation, which requires you to lay down, with this head strap is impractical as it adda quite a lot at the back of your head and basically you can’t lay down comfortably.

Battery on strap did not charge and it did not charge the main unit as well. Sent back for inmediate replacement. Received replacement a week later and another problem occured. The glue and screw on right side of the rubber headrest came off the hinge, it is impossible to fix this at home due to the position of the screw, everything is already snapped in place and unsnapping it may break the unit more. Very dissapointed with a genuine product from Facebook. Their quality assurance department seem to be sleeping at the wheel. How can such a simple item have so many faults, it's not rocket science.

ベルトの装着感が悪かったので、こちらの商品を注文しました。しかしエリートストラップを使っても装着感に納得がいかずバッテリーパックを真似てモバイルバッテリー等をポーチにまとめたおもりを用意した所装着感がかなり改善されました。そこで、装着感が悪かったのはバランスのせいではないかと思い試しにとベルトに戻しおもりを取り付けた所、あれだけ苦しかったベルトが絶妙なフィット感に。結果ベルトの方が快適になってしまったのでこちらの商品は不要になりました。純正品である事を加味しても値段が高いのでこの商品を買う前に、適切な重さのおもりを探してみる事をお勧めします。

Gare a vous si vous prenez ce cable, car ce qu'Oculus ne dit pas c'est qu'il y a de gros problèmes de compatibilité !Du coup sur certaines config l'utilisateur se retrouve en USB 2.0 au lieu d'USB 3.0, et perd tous les avantages du cable ""high-tec"". Casquer 100 euros pour ca, c'est juste de l'arnaque.De plus vous pourrez comptez sur le support pour vous ballader en accusant le pc, les mises a jour, windows, l'alignement des planetes et vous faire perdre des heures des heures en réinstallation alors qu'en fait le bug est juste chez eux. J'ose pas imaginer ce qu'ils auraient osé me sortir sorti si j'avais pas eu le cable officiel.Bref...Virtual Desktop c'est bien, et tant qu'a subir le bug vaut mieux le subir avec un cable a 20 euros que celui-la, car non l'officiel ne garanti rien du tout.

Fantastic upgrade to the Quest 2 headset! First thing you will notice is how much better the weight distribution is. No more front heavy issues, yes it still feels like you have something on your head but so much more comfortable than with the original strap and more comfortable than the Quest 1. I had a friend that likes to come over and play VR on my Quest 2, he found the elastic strap uncomfortable on his head and so I purchased the Elite Strap to make it more enjoyable for friends and family to play, he immediately found it a far more enjoyable experience, you can play for hours without any issues. No more sore neck from the uneven weight. And as a bonus it makes the headset look amazing! If you have the extra money and want to improve the Quest 2 then definetly grab the Elite Strap! This is a must buy and you won't regret the purchase!

I am not a frequent user of my Quest 2, I mainly use it when the interest arises. I have looked after my headset and there is not a single bit of cosmetic damage, outside of some mild discolouration caused by sweat. When I tried to use it today, the side plastic, used to adjust the size, broke completely down the middle. No pressure was put on it, I merely picked it up and it broke. I am very disappointed, thus far I have had a great experience with the elite strap and to have it break so early is a real shame.

Nice and comfortable than stock strap however i have had 2 now and both have cracked in roughly the same area on the main frame. I've been accepted a replacement and i am just awaiting delivery however kinda annoying how the majority of them snap. It doesn't seem like ""Just a bad batch"" i think just faulty design and bad material used. I'm contemplating on the frankenquest which involves the HTC Vive deluxe audio strap

Overall, it's pretty good!I've taken a star off because the zip strap could be a little easier to grab and doesn't seem as sturdy. The carry strap at the top is good, but there's no way to for it to clip on other things as it's just a strap, you have to clip other things onto it if you know what I mean, which isn't bad, but might reduce some possiblities.

Beware the positive reviews, it works fine until it breaks and then you'll wish you didn't buy it.Strap has become misaligned, wont tighten on one side so one side is always closer than the other.

Cette nouvelle sangle fait la différence par rapport aux élastiques proposés de base pour le Quest 2 toutefois il semble qu'il faille quand même serrer pas mal cette dernière pour qu'elle tienne au moins aussi bien tous les élastiques point alors certes il n'est pas question d'avoir un truc qui nous sert le visage autant que ce que proposaient les élastiques mais je comprends mieux maintenant pourquoi les commentaires disent que ça peut se casser car en effet on aurait tendance avoir envie de serrer plus la molette pour que le casque ne bouge pas... je pense donc que ça n'est clairement pas la fixation la plus adaptée

C'est consternant qu'au prix où est vendu cet article, il soit aussi fragile. J'avais vu plusieurs commentaires mentionnant la fragilité de la sangle, mais au vu des retours majeurs et de l’inconfort de la sangle de base, la plupart des critiques sur le net recommandait l'achat de la sangle élite.Hors, je suis désolé mais au prix où cette sangle est vendue, on est en droit de s'attendre à mieux ! Ma sangle s'est cassée en moins de 2 semaines, alors que j'ai bien fais attention à ne pas abîmer le casque justement au vus des retours des autres commentaires. Et c'est justement en l'utilisant comme il est pensé que la sangle c'est fendue. Le casque et la sangle sont pensé pour être rétracté et relevé afin de mettre le casque ou le retirer. Cependant, c'est apparemment ce geste qui aurait finit par l'abîmer.La sangle apportait pourtant relativement plus de confort que la sangle de base (que je trouves vraiment désagréable lors d’utilisation intensive et en plus de cela à tendance à ne pas tenir le casque correctement.) Mais au vu de sa fragilité il m'est impossible de la recommander.Reste a espérer que les alternatives 3rd party proposent des sangles plus robuste que celle-ci.

Use this for VR boxing so ideally you want a tight fit so it does not slide around.The strap tightens on both sides until it goes under slight pressure were it then just tightens one side causing the rear of strap to be uneven and therefore slide around while moving my head.

Etui très jolie mais un peu juste pour ranger le casque avec une sangle en option (NEWZEROL Sangle De Tête Compatible pour Oculus Quest 2, qui est plus pratique que la sangle original de base), impossible de mettre également les manettes si elles sont équipées de protections (NEWZEROL Couverture de la Poignée du Contrôleur [Couverture Complète], car la place dans l'étui est seulement étudié pour mettre l'ensemble sans rajouter des options ...Dommage !!! De plus la fermeture par zip est un peu à mon avis fragile...

The strap is great. Much more comfortable than the one that comes in the box, and makes switching between people much easier. Unfortunately, like many others I've ran in to the issue of the plastic arms cracking. I've been very careful with it but it wasn't good enough. 1/5 for durability.

Housse de rangement de la marque oculus. J’ai testé que celui ci et il ne m’a pas donné envie d’en tester d’autre. Ça reste un rangement imposant mais vu la taille de l’oculus à la base faut s’y attendre. Petit compartiment pour ranger le chargeur très pratique, dessin à l’intérieur pour le sens de rangement des manettes (très pratique aussi même si ça parait bête). Ce sont les deux petits détails auxquels je n’avais pas porté attention avant de l’acheter donc c’est pour cela que je précise. Bon achat je recommande

Malheureusement, le support de tête est cassé à plusieurs reprises. Juste à la tête avec de nombreux mouvements, le plastique devrait être plus flexible et ne pas se casser. Après la dépose, j'ai constaté que même dans un endroit protégé à l'intérieur de la partie arrière de la tête, le plastique était fissuré. Garantie ?

Un lot de deux protections, une pour visage plus large et une pour visage plus fin que la protection d'origine. Une des deux est donc inutile.Dans mon cas la protection pour visage plus fin améliore légèrement le confort mais est inutilisable avec mes lunettes...J'ai suite à ça pris la décision de commander des verres correcteurs qui se fixent directement dans le casque, plus besoin de lunette avec ça (très agréable) mais ça rend les anneaux anti-lumière inutilisables...Bref, ça fait cher pour le peu de confort gagné.

光ファイバーのアクティブケーブルなので1万円と高価ですが、軽くて柔らかく、Oculus側がL字になっているので使い勝手が良いです。Oculusに留めるマジックテープが収納時はそのままケーブルを止めるバンドとして使えるので、良く考えられています。昔は仕様が違ったみたいですので、ある意味改良された部分だと思います。購入前は2mのUSB3.0ケーブルを仮に使っていましたが、それに比べてラグが出たり画質が落ちるという事も体感的に無いので、ちゃんとUSB3.0の速度は出ていると思われます。中身は光ファイバーとの事なので、踏んで折ったりしないよう気を付けて使いたいと思います。その点と、やはり価格がネックなので、星4としました。

割れる、割れたと聞いていたので無理な力がかからないように使っていたつもりでしたが、割れました。おすすめできなくなりました。以下、購入時のレビュー純正のゴムバンドを使っていても、特別気になるところはありません。上部のマジックテープの長さの調整がうまく行けば、結構快適に使うことができます。それでも、長時間使用していると不満が出てきます。頭をぶん回したり、反復横とびをしてみせたり。そんな使い方だと、純正のゴムバンドはズレます。顔に当たる部分もだんだん気になってきて、ゲームどころではありません。このELITEストラップであれば、後頭部の出っ張りを大きく支えることでしっかりとホールドできます。これが、純正のゴムバンドと違ってキツく締めなくてもいいところがポイントです。そして、ELITEストラップを使うとOculus Quest2本体のストラップ取り付け位置が水平位置から上下に動くことの意味が出てきます。ELITEストラップを先に固定して、Oculus Quest2本体を上下にひねることで顔に当たる部分の負担を減らすことが出来ます。Oculus Quest2本体が頬に当たって痛い方は、これでだいぶ解消されます。唯一の難点は、寝ながらのプレイがやりにくいことでしょうか。寝ながらのプレイ時にはゴムバンドに戻すことをお勧めします。結構なお値段ですが、純正のゴムバンドに不満がある方は買いです。おすすめいたします！

SECOND REVIEWTLDR: Many reports of straps cracking or breaking off. Be wary of spending $50 as this may happen to you. Not a great step up so unless you plan on using your headset often, reconsider.After a week of usage, my opinion has not changed too much. In terms of fulfilling it's purpose, the Elite Strap does a better job distributing weight than the cloth strap. The twisting mechanism to tighten the strap is also easier to do compared to the cloth strap. However, there is still the issue of the headset being too front heavy. Even with the Elite Strap, it's definitely noticeable. After an hour or so of usage, your neck will get pretty sore from carrying the weight of the headset. It would work a lot better if the back of the Elite Strap was heavier to offset the weight.Even with this, I was considering changing my review from a 3/5 star to a 4/5 star, however, an issue came up.Quality (2/5)One of my main worries when using the strap was how thin the side plastic was. Sure, it was solid, but for certain VR games that require a lot of movement, the strap may not hold up. While this hasn't happened to me (yet) many other people have reported the side straps cracking or snapping off entirely. Apparently only after a few days of use while playing moderately intense games like Beat Saber. Others have also claimed that simply adjusting the straps lead to them cracking. While I'm unsure if this is universal or just certain product malfunctions, the fact that this has occurred to certain people is concerning.----FIRST REVIEWTDLR: Feels better than the cloth strap but painfully difficult to install. May not be worth the $50 unless you're planning on using your headset often.If you're someone like me who did a lot of research into the Occulus Quest 2 before buying it, you probably know the gripes reviewers have about the quality of the cloth strap. This product serves as a replacement and in some ways solves the issue but has its downsides.Installation (2/5):There is no nice way to say it. The installation was frustrating at best and potentially dangerous at worse. The Quest 2 comes with some removable parts that are necessary when installing the elite strap. First, you must remove the cloth strap. For some unknown reason, there is no sliding mechanism or a way to lock it in place that doesn't require pulling it out. Doing so is difficult as it requires quite a bit of force and its hard to tell which part is part of the strap and which part is part of the headset. I spent a couple minutes prying and seeing where it was supposed to come off before I resolved to just force it off and hope for best. It came off fine but its not unlikely that you may accidentally damage your headset as its just that confusing.For installing the strap itself, this part was even worse. The instructions are pretty vague so it takes a bit of interpreting to find the best way to approach it. It works similar to the way the cloth strap came off where there is no sliding/locking mechanism. You just have to force the strap onto the headset and hope it locks. Trying to gently attach it isn't an option as the arms of the headset are pretty thick and requires a lot of strength to get them to go over it. Like with the cloth strap, I spent a couple minutes trying to attach it before resolving to just roughly pushing it onto the arms. This took a couple tries before it finally clicked. Once again, it worked, but its not unlikely that you may damage your headset in the process.First Impressions (4/5):Works as advertised. It distributes the weight far better than the cloth strap though the headset is still very front heavy. The size adjusting is a dial which is far more convenient than the cloth strap.----I'll be updating this review as I get a better feel of it.

初代に比べて本体付属のバンドではのフィット感が（さほど悪くはないのですが）イマイチに感じたので、評判の良いこちらのエリートストラップを購入しました。前後に重心が分散されつつしっかり固定されフィット感は改善したのですが、自分にとっては重さの方が気になってしまい結局元のバンドに戻してしまいました。プレイしていれば重さはそこまで気にならなくなりますし元々気にならない人も多いと思いますが、自分のような方も他にもいるかもしれませんので、一度本体のバンドが自分に合うか合わないか確認してから注文すれば良いのではないかと思います。正直、自分にとっては初代に最初から付いていた伸縮ストラップがベストでした…コストカットのためとはいえちょっと残念です。

The cable works great for both charging the Oculus Quest 2 and providing Oculus Link connectivity to your headset for playing PC VR titles.  BUT, it's practically worthless at this price!  Here's why:The Quest 2 comes with a charging cable that works perfectly well for charging the headset and providing data access for things like SideQuest, an app that allows you to sideload (install without using the Oculus app) apps and games on to your headset.The Quest 2 also supports the WiFi 6 wireless standard.  If you have a WiFi 6 wireless router, you can use an app called Virtual Desktop to play all your PC VR games without the need for a wire running down your back.  The latency is incredibly low, making for an amazing completely-wireless Link gaming experience.If you don't have a WiFi 6 wireless router, you can still use Virtual Desktop and play your games completely wirelessly!  The latency is slightly higher and the bandwidth is lower (you may need to drop your graphical settings to get it to play right) but still completely enjoyable for everyone not playing in competitive gaming tournaments.There are two advantages to this cable over using your Quest 2 wirelessly: latency is virtually eliminated when playing over wire, and trickle charging your headset while in use.  Most reviewers agree that the cable works perfectly well for Oculus Link gameplay (though some argue playing through Virtual Desktop wirelessly instead of through Oculus's Link interface is actually faster).  And while plugged in, your Rift 2 battery gets a partial charge while plugged in.  That's not to say you can use the headset indefinitely; the battery still drains faster than the cable tops it up.  But it does allow for longer gameplay without having to buy an external battery pack or the expensive Elite Strap with Battery.tl;dr: this is a very expensive USB cable that almost no one really needs.  If you don't have a PC, or PC VR games you want to play on your Quest 2, don't buy this.  If you have a relatively new wifi router that offers 2.4GHz and 5GHz connections, don't buy this (get Virtual Desktop from the Oculus Store instead, and find a youtuber that can show you how to play PC games wirelessly).  If you need absolute-zero latency for competitive gaming, then this is the closest you'll get.

購入当初は付け心地が良く愛用していましたが、他の方が指摘している通り、1か月もしないうちにひびが入ってきました。特に無茶はせずむしろ噂を聞いていたので負荷をかけないよう緩めにつけていたぐらいです。対策としては、ストラップを出来るだけ縮めないほうが良いらしいです。縮めた時にストラップ部分に負荷がかかって割れているという説があるようです。ひび割れた段階で返却期間を過ぎており途方に暮れてます。6000円近くも払わせてこの品質はあまりにも酷いです。そして12/5現在アナウンスもなしでだんまりを決め込んでるようです。Facebookの製品に対する姿勢は良く理解できたので、他社から良い無線PCVRが出たらQuest2ごと売り払ってFaceBookの製品は二度と買わないことにします。万が一購入を考えている方がいたら迷わず他社製のストラップにすることをお勧めします。値段が安く、少なくともこれよりは耐久性あると思いますので。

ヘッドストラップの内側は逆三角計のような黒色フレームで後頭部を包み込むような構造になっていて、頭をスッポリと包んでくれます。黒色フレーム部分はゴムと樹脂の間のような質感で、滑らかな手触りかつ、しなやかで柔軟性があり、髪の毛が引っかかったり、締め付けた時の痛みはありません。バッテリー内蔵と同じ構造で軽いので、装着感は当然こちらの方が上です。Quest 2 Eliteストラップ」で1つだけ惜しいところは、バッテリー内蔵版にあるケーブルガイドがないところです。このケーブルガイドがあると、純正Oculus Linkケーブルを装着した時にケーブルの取り回しが改善され、不意に引っ張られた時にも方向によってはコネクタ破損をガードしてくれそうなので、付属させて欲しかったです。軽くて装着感が良く、Oculus Linkとならバッテリーの心配もなくなってベストな相棒と言えただけに非常に残念。

9月10日に予約して10月29にようやく到着。oculus quest2は買ったはいいがマジでフィット感が最悪で、流石に我慢の限界で先にMOMOVR M2のストラップを購入。これで不満の8割は解消したが、やっぱり接顔パーツのフィット感が気になる。quest初代機では何ら不満なかったのに何故にquest2はこんなにフィッティングが悪いのか？・・・・まぁ安く出す為にワザとオプション買うように設計したとしか思えないが・・・。という事で、結局はその思惑に嵌って純正OPのフィットパックを購入した訳だが、結論から言うと5千円出した価値は微妙。ワイドと標準で明らかに変わるけど、期待してたquest初代機レベルのフィッティングは得られなかった。まぁそれでもフィッティング自体は明らかに良い方向に変化はした。ここをどう考えるかは個人差があるだろうから他の人がどう思うかはなんとも言えない。ちなみに標準の接顔パーツとこの純正オプションのワイドを並べた写真を2枚添付したが僅かに薄くなってるだけなのが分かると思う。quest初代機の標準とこのワイドを比べた写真（1が初代標準で2がquest2のワイド）を見れば何とまぁ全然ワイドじゃない。これはもはや絶対ワザとやってるレベル。リコール？かかっただかで無料でシリコンカバー配ってたが、これにはワイド&ナロー共にちゃんとシリコンカバーも付属していたのはgood。しかも標準用に送られてきたシリコンカバーはヨレが出やすいがこっちは激しく動いてもヨレが出ずに工作精度は上がってる感じなのもgood。遮光ブロッカーもカチッと嵌まるしホントこの辺の工作精度の高さは相変わらず素晴らしい。ただ遮光ブロッカーは想像よりも遮光しない。ある意味効果は感じない。これも顔の作りと大きく関係するから他の人でどうかはなんとも言えない。結論としては、良い方に変化はあったが5千円出した価値は微妙。quest2のフィッティングに我慢できないなら、まずはストラップを購入した方が効果が高い。私はMOMOVR M2というのを買ったがフィッティングの不満の8割はそれで解消したので、ストラップと接顔パーツでどっち先に買うか迷ってるなら絶対的にストラップを買う方をお勧めする。気になる方はそっちのレビューもしてるので是非ご覧ください。結局、フィットパック5千円とストラップ4千円の合計9千円出しても、まだquest初代機標準のフィッティングの方が僅かに良いという結論。なんだかなぁ・・・。

As quite a few others have mentioned on here, the materials used for the strap are sub-par, like some flimsy vinyl polimer. Mine broke with under a hundred hours of use, just adjusting the pivot to get it on, like you're supposed to. It really wasn't much force either, and it ripped like soggy paper. Aside from that, the strap was ok at best, not much of a game changer from the cloth strap. I have a pretty big head and this needs to be fully extended to put on. If I tightened it down a little too much I noticed pain in my neck, you really need to find the sweet spot. The ratcheting mechanism that tightens it down feels extremely cheap and like it's going to break at any moment. This is definitely not worth $50, $20 tops. I'm sure glad Amazon is pretty decent with refunds. There is a third party strap on here for $40, not sure of the quality, but it'll burn a little less if it breaks.

Quest2に使用しています。もっと安価なケーブルでも略同じ速度が出てしまうので速度的なメリットは薄いです。もしかしたら極度に外部ノイズの多い環境だと差が出るかもしれません。一般利用において規格上限の+2m程度の延長では影響が少ないという事でしょう。材質などがOculusLink用に調整されていて使いやすい点だけが取り柄です。接触云々のレビューを見かけましたが、私の物はそういった事はないです。実測こそ殆ど差が無いですが、電気的なアクティブケーブルと比べてノイズには強いはずなので無意味ではないのかなと思います。無理なく延長されてるので気分は良い。本当に画質を求めるならRiftSをDisplayPortに繋いだほうが幸せです。

値段が下がること自体は大歓迎ですが、標準のベルトはあまりにひどいと思います。初代より安くなった恩恵もこれを買うことを考えると、なんか微妙です。ただ、商品のデキ自体は現状で最強で、初代のベルトより遥かにいいです。本体とベルトが水平になるようにするのが本来のベストの装着だと思うのですが、初代のベルトの構造だと本体の重さもあって、うまくいきませんでした。今回は後頭部下側にパッドを当てて、うまく固定できるようになっています。ダイヤルで締めたり緩めたりできるもイイです。初代のベルトより高コストかもしれませんが、会社があれだけ儲かってんだから、標準でつけてくれても良かったのでは。商品自体は★五つですが、企業の姿勢はいろいろ思うところはあります。

本体購入後、標準のストラップの装着感がイマイチで、Eliteストラップを購入。標準と比べると脱着のし易さ、本体との前後バランス、本体の顔に対する当り具合、あらゆる面で改善していて大変気に入りました。ところが、使用し始めて10日ほど過ぎ、いざ使おうと頭に被ると何かおかしい…確認すると、現在破損報告が多数上がっているのと同じ個所（ベルトの側面部）で綺麗に割れていました。　特に力を掛けた訳でもなく、落としたりもしておらず、被る前に「あれ？」という感じです。しかも、1カ所ではなく、1㎝程間隔を空けて2カ所割れており、一方は完全に破断、一方は皮一枚繋がっている、という状態でした。明らかに素材の問題と思われ、脆性破壊の様な、光劣化の様な、何とも説明し難いですが、脆過ぎるのは間違いありません。Amazonへ現象の報告をし、手続した所承認されたので返品しました。これが無ければ良い製品なので、対策品が出ればまた購入しようと思ってます。

The straps looks well designed and uses good quality materials.However, it does not wear good and the Oculus 1 default strap feels much better.- Lack of tension/spring mechanism make it feel very uncomfortable. This is NoT like the one used in the Quest 1 or the Index. It is either too tight or too lose. The complete lack of padding aggravates the situation.- Over the head string is hard to adjust. It connects to the movable back of the strap, so it's tension depends on how much you tighten the back.

The product is actually fine, it does what it says on the tin, but it used a USB-C connection, which I was not familiar with before purchasing. I don’t know if all computers have this port, but if you do, be very careful. The inevitable movement can cause the plug on the computer end to bend and snap off like cheap garbage. If you’re going to use this, make sure it’s secured. Tie it to the leg of your computer table or something. My port was in the back, and moving around caused it to snap off in less than two weeks of use. Monumental waste of money, if you’re not careful.

※注意　ベルトの交換時にはマニュアルを良く見た上で、できればYoutubeなどの動画を確認した方が良いです。私は取り外す場所を勘違いしていて、あやうく本体を壊してしまうところでした。改良版になって販売再開されたようだったので購入してみました。確かにフィット感は向上しますが、脱着のたびにダイヤルを回さなければいけないので面倒くさいです。また、装着時に全体としての柔軟性がほとんど無いので、メガネをかけた上から装着するのは困難です。ベルトには柔軟性が無いので標準のゴムベルトのように、「メガネの上からOculusを被せるように装着してからベルトを後ろ側に回す」という装着方法はできなくなります。私の場合は、これに変えたからといって、便利になるわけでも装着感が向上するわけでもありませんでした。

タイトルの通りです。先人の方のご指摘の通り私は周りと比べて彫が深いと言われておりまして他皆様のレビューの通り見え方についてはあまりよくなりませんでした。購入した理由としては”見え方については効果ないような気がするけどビートセイバー等の激しく動くゲームなら効果あるだろう”という点になります。上記にはそこそこ効果がありました。ALTDEUS: Beyond Chronosのような四方八方を見るようなゲーム。Pistol Whipのような激しいゲームでもある程度ずれません。(元のストラップでビートセイバー2曲分、こちらで4曲分ぐらいでしょうか。)ただ見え方についてはそこまでは大きく変化は感じませんでした。なんなら見え方については元のほうが見えやすいと感じたほどです。・元のストラップは緩い代わりに好きな位置に持ってこれて焦点が合わせやすい。・こちらの商品はキツイのでズレないが見えやすい位置に持ってきにくい上記を踏まえた上でこの高価な商品を検討されるのが良いと思います。デメリットを踏まえた上でこちらの☆となります。やはり値段が高いのがなんとも、、勿論映画をＶＲで見よう。という方は元のほうが寝ながら見れますし、見え方も遥かに良いです。動かないならば数時間は一番良い見え方のままですし。

前機に慣れていた方はQuest2のバンドだと物足りないと思ったかと思います。私もそうでした。装着もしづらく、ゴムバンドが捻れてしまうことも多々ありました。この商品は前機と同じ仕様になるものなのかと購入しましたが、その予想の上を行く商品でした！取り付けは説明書があるので間違うことはないかと思いますが、フレームの根元から取れる訳ではないので無理やり外そうとして折らないように気をつけてください。付け替えてみると見た目も良くなりました。実際装着してみると後頭部のダイヤルを左に回せば広がり、右に回せば閉まっていきます。片手でサイズ調整ができるようになり、かなり便利になりました。なにより装着までのスピードが全く違います。スピーディーにベストな位置に固定することができます。実際にゲーム（音ゲーとスポーツ系）もしてみましたが、ヘッドセットがズレることもなく安定性も抜群です。重心もバランス良くなったため、これで長時間のプレイも耐えられるかもしれません。

快適にVRを楽しみたかったら、エリートストラップは必須です。これを付けていないと、重心が前に行く為、そういうのが少しでも気になる方は、エリートストラップがないと、確実にストレスになります。エリートストラップを付ける際に、フェイスカバー？をそっと取ってください。やサイドの部分をひねって取ってください。などがありますが、説明書の通りに取ろうとしたら、これは本当にあってるのか？と思うと思うのですが、フェイスカバーは割と強く、再度の部分も割と強くひねれば、しっかり取れると思います。レビューを見て、折れるかもしれない！と不安な方々は、安心してもらってもいいと思います。荒く扱わない限りは、おそらく絶対に折れることはないと思います。

If you are looking for an expensive and aesthetically pleasing case, feel free to read no further - this is likely the case you want.If you interested in function, read on:Pros: The case seems reasonably hard and well made. It has a strap to carry to carry it. The Quest 2 fits in it as expected. It will fit the elite strap no problem. It is aesthetically pleasing in many ways.Cons: I hate the feel of the outside of the case. It feels like hard felt to me and when my fingers graze the case it’s like tying wet shoelaces. It makes me shiver and cringe. The zipper is hidden which is aesthetically pleasing, but I could never once get it to open or close all the way without the zipper jamming at least once. Oculus has also tied the thinnest piece of string in the world to the zipper so when the zipper inevitably gets jammed, the string pulls right off. Then you have to replace it with something thicker/tougher because putting that tiny piece of string back on only means pulling it off again very soon. The inside has a tiny compartment at one end that fits the charging brick and not much else. If you do put something small in there (like spare AA’s) the case design has space between the compartment and the lid that allows those AA’s free access to the headset’s lenses. So you probably shouldn’t put spare AA’s in there. The middle section for the controllers where has a weird design that just about everyone will struggle with. I considered cutting out the diagram of how the controllers are supposed to fit in there and taping it inside the case for reference. Intuitive? No. And last, but certainly not least, the size of the case is quite a bit bigger than the Quest 1. Again there doesn’t seem to be a purpose other than aesthetics. The Quest 2 headset is actually smaller and I didn’t get any meaningful storage space inside the new case to warrant the larger size.Bottom line, I am returning it and getting a 3rd party case because I’d much rather have function over aesthetics. But that’s me. If you don’t care so much about function and love the aesthetics, go ahead and spend the $50. You won’t be disappointed with the aesthetics.

買ってみると確かに効果はある。頭のてっぺんからアイアンクローで頭全体を締め付ける感じ。ただし後頭部が出っ張っているので、寝ながら視聴は難しくなる。ただし販売姿勢がよくない。PS5を1万円で安い安いとたくさん売っておいて、後からコントローラーは別売り10万円デースという消費者をあざむく手法。それを良しとする企業姿勢。発売前にOQ2の安さを売りに宣伝したからなおさら安くない。標準でつけるべき。後付け商法。また設計上の不良で側面部がすぐ割れるようだ。どんなに丁寧に扱っていてもある日突然割れる。使用者の問題ではなく製造した設計上の問題。facebookも認めている。最悪1日、1回の使用で割れる。よって大切に長く使えるものではなく、壊れたらまた買う前提の商品であることを考えれば、価格が高すぎる。いずれまた買う前提だとすれば1980円が妥当。たとえ壊れなくても、いつでも壊れる可能性と不安感、気楽に扱えない不便さは否めない。説明書が不親切。届いて取り付け時、絵を見てもよくわからない。力づくで取り付けする構造なのだがよく壊れなかったなと思う。２０％の人が取り付けで破壊すると思う。力がいるので、一般男性なら問題ないが力のない女性は取り付け無理かも。追記）１カ月使ってみて、長持ちさせる個人的なコツ。外すときは左手でゴーグルを支えながら、右手で限界まで緩めてから外す。使わないときは常に限界まで緩めておく。この２つ。そうしないと常にアームに圧力がかかって、割れにつながる。2本の細いアームで形をカッチリ固定しているので、落としたりぶつけたりして一定の方向に大きな衝撃を与えるのも危険。万一のためにも保管は低い場所で。追記）購入後60日ほどで、左こめかみにヒビ。持ち方や本体にかかる圧力など、ヒビのことを毎度ケアしながら、誰よりも丁寧に、赤ちゃんよりも繊細に扱ったにもかかわらずヒビが発生。自分だけは大丈夫、わたしもそう思っていた時期がありました。追記）購入後180日ほどで、ヒビに加えて、左右後頭部に割れや剥がれ。これは材質に問題がある。材質がクッキーだ。常温のときは形を留まっていても、頭から発する熱や水蒸気で濡れると、材質の性能が変わる。固いクッキーも水分をくわえればすぐに割れるしふやけるし潰れる。プラスチックのパキンとした割れではなく、湿気を含んだ段ボールのようにしっとりふんわり破れていく感じ。TOFビーセイFITXRやれば汗もかく。もともとの設計ミスに加えて、頭からの熱や汗の水分で材質が弱り変形し、ヒビや割れに繋がるんだと思う。半年間毎日ヒビ割れないよう細かく気にしながら触ってみてそう断定する。追記）その後、オキュラスに連絡し交換済み。なれない書類のプリントアウトやfedexなど相手に合わせながら2週間ほどで届いた。1年弱に購入したものと全く同じ。改良などはされていない。今からヒビが出ないよう新たに改良ではなく、交換で対応するという姿勢なのだろう。新品のままもう使っていない。どうあがいてもヒビ割れる運命なので。デフォルトのストラップを使っている。色々自分で手を加えればそちらの方がフィット、安上がり、安全、気楽だ。アドバイスするなら初見で購入するのは全然アリだが、間違いなく1日以上～1年未満でヒビ割れは100%と断言する。そして慣れない国際郵便の手間がかかる。それを良しという前提で値段に目をつむれるなら買ってもいいと思う。二度と使わない新品が手元にある自分は、もう二度と買うことないが。

他に同様のレビューを書いている方多数ですが、左右に延びるプラスチックのバンドが兎に角脆いです。私の場合、購入後3ヶ月目くらいで装着前に締め付け調整のダイヤルを回していたところ突然破断しました。また、破断したのとは逆側の同じ部分をよく見たらそちらにもうっすら亀裂が。これはもはや設計上の欠陥かと…。一応、本体付属のストラップがひどすぎるのでそちらと比べれば快適にはなります。が、後ほど購入した、Eliteストラップの半額程度で売られているサードパーティ製のストラップでも正直大差はありませんでした（色々出ているので、物によるとは思いますが）。無理やり褒める点を探すとすれば見た目のスタイリッシュさですが、その為に強度を犠牲にしていると考えるとやはり何処を取ってもまともな製品と評価するには能わないと思います。結論として、こちらのEliteストラップを購入するのはおススメしません。それでも仮に購入する場合は販売元にご注意ください。Amazon.co.jp以外から購入すると公式の2年間無償交換の補償対象外になります。私の場合は購入したショップに連絡したところすぐに返金対応していただけましたが、他ショップでも同様の対応をしていただける確証はありませんので…。

結構頑丈で綺麗に入ります、ぴったりです、少しの収納ポケットもあって良いEliteストラップも綺麗に入るのがいいですね。主観ですがケースもそこまで大きいとは思いません、Eliteストラップを綺麗に入れようと思ったらこのサイズになると思いますし。ただ、チャックの持つ所が紐で開け閉めをしないといけないので多少の不安はあります、ケースが丸っこいのでケースが動いて収納時に少し入れにくいです、丸っこいので立てかけたりは無理です基本は寝かすしか出来ません後、このケース単体で持ち運びには少し向いてないかと思います、持つ所が少し持ちにくいので、収納目的ならアリな商品です。

SteamのVRテニスを好んでやっているのですが、サーブを打つ時、上を向いてから急激に首を振るという動作を行うためデフォルトのゴム紐だとズレまくりでした。もちろんこの首の動きにはカウンターウエイトなどもってのほかで、迷った挙句PSVRっぽいオデコと後頭部で支えるタイプのサードパーティ製のストラップを購入。これは見た目は最高だったのですが激しい動きだとこれもズレまくり。しかもこれ本体との固定はなんと摩擦のみなため位置直しのたびに固定部が緩んでそれもなおさなければならないという・・・。正直デフォのゴム紐の方がまだマシなくらいでした。次に後頭部のデカいパーツで支えるタイプの物を購入しましたが、これは固定具合は良かったのですが耳に干渉して痛くて長時間はツラい。それでも我慢して使っているうちにこの純正品が販売再開されたので購入したところ、ビックリするくらいきっちり固定。しかも耳にもかからない。もうホント無駄な時間と金を消費してしまったと激しく後悔。世の中には純正品より安くて高機能なサードパーティ製品もたくさんありますが、このQuest2ストラップに限って言えば「高くても黙って純正買っとけ」と言いたいです。

OculasQuest2の低価格で犠牲になった外付けパーツになります。正直な所これは標準付属していてほしかった。けれど本体を布教させるという目的でやむなく省かれたのでしょう。残念。とはいえ本体+これでも他のハードに引けを取らない価格なので、Quest2到着直後に購入しました。ゴムバンドとは比較にならないフィット感。長時間プレイするには必須ですね！　後下頭部から全体を包むようにサポートしてくれるのと、調整がダイヤル式なおかげで初期ゴムバンドとは比べ物にならない快適さです。星-1なのは値段、5000円を超えるのは財布に痛い。あとはQuest2純正のダンボールにエリートストラップを付けたまま収納できなくなる点ですね。別途ケースや必要によってメガネレンズ等を購入すると追加で1万くらい飛んでいきました。快適さは段違いです。ゴムバンドが合わなくて迷っているなら、ぜひ購入をおすすめします。

性能は抜群と言えます。フィット感は標準のストラップと比較して、比べものにならない高さがあります。アジャストも極めてしやすく、これを標準のストラップとして本体に附属して販売しても良かったのではないでしょうか。ただし、耐久性には極めて厳しい難があります。ストラップのプラパーツ自体が非常に薄いため、気付いたら折れていました。仕方なく接着材とガムテープで補強をして利用継続。しかし、いつの間にかまた別の箇所が折れていました。軽量化のためにパーツを薄くしているのだとは思いますが、この耐久性は実用の上で難点となっています。性能が高いために、引き続き補修して利用を続けようとは思いますが、サードパーティーのものでなにかもっと良いのがあれば、そちらを使いたいかなとも思います。

サード製のストラップでハズレを引いたのでこちらを買いなおしたのですが、結論から言うとめちゃくちゃ良いわけでもなく、粗悪品というわけでもない微妙なラインの製品です。ちょっと意外だったのですが、製品画像だと後頭部を支えるパーツが硬いプラスチックみたいに見えますが、実際は柔軟性のあるゴムみたいな感じです。【良い点】・取付けが簡単付属の布ストラップを外してこのストラップをQuest2に取り付ける必要があるのですが、両方とも思ってたより楽ですぐにできました。力を入れて差し込んだりする必要がないのは助かりますね。・装着感が良くなる少なくとも付属の布ストラップに比べれば装着感は上がります。後ろにカウンターウェイトとしてモバイルバッテリーなどをつけるとさらに良くなります。・調整が楽いちいち外して微調節が必要な布ストラップに比べると、つけたままダイヤルを回すだけでいいので調整が簡単です。複数人で使いまわすような場合には便利だと思います。【微妙な点】・おでこへの圧迫感主におでこと後頭部で挟む形になるので、ダイヤルをきっちり締めるとおでこへの圧が結構かかります。布ストラップと違い、その分頬への圧力はなくなるのでトレードオフな感じです。・耐久性が心配箱から出して手に取ってみて最初に思ったんですが、ストラップ部分が結構ペラペラなんですよね。思ってたより薄くて変形しやすいので、本当にQuest2の重量を支え切れるのか心配になりました。壊れやすいという話も納得です。これで7000円弱か…とはいえ、2年保証がついているので壊れても期間いっぱい保証を使いまくれますね。こんな感じで全体的に可もなく不可もなく、といった製品です。特にオススメしたいとは思えませんが、絶対に買わない方がいい、とまでは思いません。もし保証を利用する前提で買うのであれば、バッテリーが付属していない方をオススメします。［追記］書いた後からQuest2側のアームの向きを変えられることに気づき、うまく調節してみたらおでこへの圧迫感が分散され顔全体にフィットしました。装着感が上がったので星をひとつ上げておきます。少なくとも布ストラップよりは使いやすいので買ってみてもいいかもしれません。値段さえもうちょっと安ければオススメできるんですが…

Quest 2 を購入した後に持ち運びに困ったので購入してみました。表面は硬めのフェルトっぽい触感で、閉じた時の耐衝撃性はなかなかのように感じます。ジッパーの取手部分は非常に細く頼りなく見えますが、ジッパー部分の隙間に収納できる細さなので見栄え的には悪くないと思います。内部にはかなり余裕があり、Eliteストラップ無しの場合追加で充電器が1つ余裕で入るぐらいのスペースがあります。Bluetoothイヤホンや重り、バッテリー、タオルなどを入れても良いかもと思いました。Quest 2 自体の電池消費が激しいので、充電器を入れるスペースがあるのは助かります。欠点としては大き過ぎます。リュックサックに入れた場合ほとんどの体積がコイツで取られます。かと言ってリュックにかけるには大き過ぎます。これだけ手で持つのも絶妙に持ちにくいです。また値段も高過ぎと思います。サードパーティの価格帯を考えると、ものは良いですが4000〜5000円が妥当と思います。無印良品のメイクボックスMがちょうどストラップ無しの状態で収納するのに良いらしいです。

Quest 2購入後、標準ストラップが自分には相性が悪く、使用中も動くとレンズのスイートスポットからズレる等の問題を感じたため、こちらのストラップを追加購入しました。結果としては大正解でした。重量バランスが改善した事で顔だけに掛かっていた負荷が頭全体に分散され装着感が格段に向上。後頭部からしっかりホールドしてくれるので激しく動いても全くズレない。調整方式がダイヤルに変わった事で調整自体もとても楽になりました。家族や友人に遊ばせたいという方にもオススメです。唯一のデメリットとしては後頭部にプラスチックの硬い部品が追加されるため寝ながら動画を鑑賞する等の使用には向かなくなります。ゲーム中心か動画中心かでこの商品の価値はかなり変わってくると思います。私のVR生活には欠かせないアクセサリになりました。

Eliteストラップはバッテリー内蔵のものと、内蔵していないものがありますが私はバッテリーなし版を選びました。バッテリー内蔵モデルはやや重いのと、Oculus Linkが使えなくなるので。そもそもVRデバイスってそんなに長時間使いませんし。標準のストラップは嵩張らないというメリットはありますがズレやすく装着感には若干の難があります。Eliteストラップは硬さがあるため、帽子やヘルメットをかぶる感覚で、スッと装着できます。締め付け調整もダイヤルを回すだけなので、楽ですね。収納時に嵩張るようになるのが唯一の難点かと。

すべてが劇的に変わった。ゴムバンドの頃は重心が前だったので両目あかんべえ状態だったのだが、バランスが取れてあかんべえ状態が改善された。脱着が楽になったのでストレスがない。使用頻度が増えた。最初からつけて欲しかった、高くなっても良いから。

Oculus Quest 2 を使うのに標準のストラップだときつかったりしめるときに髪の毛を巻き込んだりするうえ、しっかり固定できないので動いたり顔の向きを変えるとずれてしまいます。こちらは脱着もはるかに簡単で、ちゃんと固定でき、それでいて通常ストラップよりも軽く感じるくらいです。あえて言うと、めがね用スペーサーをつけたうえでメガネをつけて取り付けようとすると少しはめにくかったりします。とはいえQuest 2使う時はこれなしは考えられない必須アイテムです。

In short I'm very pleased I chose the official hardware over the cheaper alternatives.I received my Official Oculus Link cable extremely quickly with my prime membership. The product feels well made and has a nice tactile feel to it. The packaging had a very expensive feel that was on par with the quality of the product inside. For an outrageously priced cable it seems the manufacturer didn't want the product to appear cheap in any way.Pros:- Shipped fast- High Quality Materials- Exactly as described, USB-C to C cableCons:- Excessively packaged, leaving the impression I probably paid for the box it came in.- No bag or clip to keep the cable when not in use

Much better than the regular strap. Can't comment on the battery pack since I can't figure out how to charge it. The details on this page say no extra cables needed to charge but I see a USB port with no USB cable.  Not sure if I'm missing the charging cable or if I'm just confused on how it charges.Update: Finally figured it out...duh!  You plug in the battery cable to the oculus charging port and then plug the Oculus charging cable into the battery charging port. Your HUD will display the current charge for both batteries which is really nice.  Last long too! I spent 3hrs playing and still hadn't gotten to the oculus battery. Best investment for the Quest 2 so far.

I bought this around January. I saw all the reviews posted around October thinking that the problem was solved after Facebook said it was just a “processing inconsistency with some early units.” Also saw they were selling them again after delaying them back November. I thought the problem must have been fixed with that on top of extending their warranty an extra year.It’s still not good enough apparently, because mine has now cracked after only using it a week.I’ll be using their warranty to get another one, but even if it is much better quality and never breaks the headset itself is very tight for people with big heads even when extended all the way. I’ll update on how annoying it it to use the warranty.

Everyone head is shape differently, so one headstrap might be amazingly comfortable for one person but gives another person a headache. Because of this, it is hard to really tell what headstrap is the ""best"", but I think this one has been well thought out.I've tried the Bobovr M2 Pro and Kiwi Elite Strap before landing on this one. I was hesitant to use this one because of all the reported issues, but the 2 years warranty somewhat puts my worries at ease since by the time that warranty does expire, you probably already moved onto a different headset. I think this will be very comfortable for most people, but again there's going to be some who find this not so comfortable.At first the strap would touch the top of my ears. This would cause my ears to get a bit sore after an hour of use. However, after adjusting the strap so that it sits a bit higher up, this is no longer an issue. Compared to the Kiwi Elite strap, this is narrower which not only looks a bit better, but also makes it work with more headphones. The Kiwi's back padding is pleather on hard plastic while the official Elite strap has a rubbery cup. I think the official strap actually does a better job to conforming to the back of your head, but it's not like the Kiwi strap is uncomfortable. The biggest advantage this has over the Kiwi is that it has a built-in battery. This helps makes it a little more comfortable as it acts as a counterweight, but it also significantly extends play time. You can strap on a battery pack, but this is a far more elegant solution.Compared to the Bobovr M2 Pro, I think still comes out on top for most people. Unless you are dead set on a halo-style strap, this beats the M2 Pro in many aspects. One, the build quality feels better. Yes this has been known to snap, but the M2 Pro just feels ""cheap"". There's a lot of rough plastic, the pleather is very firm, it's got Bobovr branding all over, and it has some questionable design decision. The battery pack on the Elite pack is double of what you get on the M2 Pro, so you can go longer in a single session. However, the M2 Pro battery is hotswappable, allowing you to pretty much have infinite play time.I also tried the DAS frakenquest mod and I think the Elite strap makes more sense. Both have a very similar mounting style, but I think the Elite strap does a better job as it conforms to the back of your head better. the DAS has a hard plastic shell with thin padding, which hurts my head after an hour of play. The headphones of the DAS provide a bit more body to the audio, but you lose a bit of ""spaciousness"" due to the fact you have some things sitting on your ears.You should try a few different headstrap before this one since this is one of the more expensive options. It's a bit pricey even if you consider convenience. If it was a bit cheaper this would be a no brainer, but at this price you really have to make sure this is the most comfortable solution before going for it.

I think the OQ2 is absolutely fabulous. However, it is very very uncomfortable to play. At lease for people with larger head/face. I have redness over my cheek area all the time. But if I tried to loosen it a bit then it goes blurry. So I had to stop evert 30 mins or so which is very disappointing.First impression:For this elite strap, assembly is a bit tricky like some other reviews already mentioned. You have to be very careful not to tear your OQ2 apart. Other wise, it takes about 10 mins or less to do.Pros: helps a little bit with fitting, but still not good enough.  It just makes you feel a little bit better by giving a little bit more support from the back of your head. Also it helps when you use action/fitness apps. But remember, it would be totally naïve to think this would solve your problem.Cons: way too much overpriced! I am planning on a long term use but this is still not the 'perfect solution'. You still have problems with whatever you had with your original head strap. And you need to pay extra to get comfortable playing OQ2.

Honestly. This product works great. The fault lies in the design. I’ve maybe used this thing for about 20-30 hours of gameplay, and I’ve had no issue. Well I just got done playing today and removed the usbc3 connector from my computer. I noticed the connector was a little loose so I kinda wiggled it a little bit to see if it was just like that or if it was broken and it fell right off. I really don’t understand, I’ve been VERY careful about this cable because it’s so damn expensive. It’s ridiculous.I’ve reached out to Oculus support because I’ve had it for a little over a month now, hoping I’m not just SOL and out $70.Will never purchase again, terrible design for the computer/laptop connector side. The headset connector is great and sturdy. (Added both sides in photos)Like I said, I was insanely careful with this product.I would make sure I was facing one direction the entire time so I wouldn’t pull or step on the cable. The design really needs to be rethought. Honestly just having the computer connector mimic the headset connector would be a huge upgrade to durability.Hopefully they re-think this design because it’s not worth the risk.Edit 6/23/2021I am sending the cable back through Oculus Report to exchange for a refurbished replacement through the warranty. Will update when I receive it. I also ordered a way cheaper alternative through Amazon. Will update how that goes as well.Edit: 7/1/2021I sent the cable back and UPS said they received it 6/25/2021. Haven’t heard anything yet.The cable I bought as a temporary replacement is way better than I thought. Quality wise it’s literally the same as the oculus cable, the only thing is it won’t charge your headset. But if you aren’t playing for more than 3 hours 30 minutes at a time you’ll be fine. This is the one I got: KRX Link Cable Compatible for Oculus Quest 2, Fast Charing & PC Data Transfer USB C 3.2 Gen1 Cable for VR Headset and Gaming PC. You’ll have to copy and paste the link. There’s no drop in quality of picture or performance, only downside is the charging. I recommend that cable as an alternative to this one. Another bonus is that it is USB to USBC3 instead of double USBC3.Edit: 7/13/2021STILL waiting on a replacement cable. They’ve confirmed they received my return but it’s been since 6/25/21, so not sure why it’s taking so long to send out a replacement. Terribly long time for support. Really glad I bought the other cable for cheap. Honestly it does everything but the charging, just get that one.Edit: 7/15/2021I’ve been contacted by a representative after I asked what was taking so long. I was told that the “Warehouse team is trying to locate your returned item so we can get the replacement to you.”  So I guess we’ll see where it goes from here.Edit: 7/23/2021 -FINALI was told by the Oculus rep that “the warehouse could not locate your return”. But they sent me a brand new cable anyways so that was good I guess. Disappointing that it took a month to get a replacement on such an expensive cable. Just go third party way cheaper and more reliable.

Final update: Virtual Desktop rocks and I rarely use the cable anymore, so can not speak to The new one holding up. It still works, but who can turn down wire free. In hindsight this remains an overpriced cable and would have saved myself the money and headache. Live and learn.Update:  A week after the limit for returning the cable with Amazon it failed. I suspect the straight connection. Treated gently and it is not a system issue, as my PartyLine 10’ continues to chug along.  I have been going back and forth with Oculus support as they troubleshoot the issue, but it is taking a lot of time and after the first wave, most of the directions became hard to see as relevant to the issue. When I questioned the process I stopped hearing from that person. After a week or so I had to start a second ticket because the first one was somehow closed. Feel free to interpret that as you will.  Another two rounds of partially  relevant requests and I finally got an RMA. I am now about another week or so away from getting a replacement because mine has to get to the warehouse before they will send another. Long process and not user friendly.  Glad I have a backup cable from another company. Depending on your needs and patience level, I would recommend buying from a place like Best Buy where you can buy into their warranty and limit dealing with Oculus support.  The process for me was a marketing person’s headache. All that drama for an overpriced cable that clearly failed. All relevant info was presented after the first exchange of emails. For Reference, first email to support was on 7 Sep. and it is now 10 Oct. will update once new cable shows up. Grips aside, when it works it is/was great. Mileage may vary.  Leaving the 2 star for the moment. Will climb to 3 if I get a working cable and will consider another bump if it lasts a few months.Original: I have been using a 10’ usb-c to usb-c from another company since the link became an option due to the high cost and limited supply of the official cable, but decided to cough up the money to get more range. I spend more time on Steam VR games than on Occulus titles, so the link is regularly used.  My experience is on day one. Love the extra length, cable is solid, and data seems faster. Yes it should have an adapter and yes it still feels overpriced, but it works great.I really don’t get low reviews from people who can’t read the description or comprehend pictures. It is usb-c to usb-c. That is it. That and a clip for the side to guide the cable down the strap is all you get. Nobody else at this time puts out a cable that will do all this one does at the same time. On a normal day I would give this a 4 of 5 because of the cost, but too many low ratings for reasons that are weak, so have given it a compensatory 5. This works, will see how it lasts.

I was able to test this by taking it to a hospital parking garage to use while waiting for a surgery to finish. The case looks and feels premium but I don't think it's worth it's initial asking price. It feels 30% more expensive than it should be. The front pocket compartment is great for storing lens wipes. However the compartment wall doesn't extend to the top of the case so there's a gap that would allow small objects to escape from that compartment. I wouldn't put small objects like batteries in there as they could eventually find their way to your HMD's lenses. I'm sure I'll get better at putting the controllers away but I don't like it. The controller placement is not intuitive and it takes a few tries to get the orientation right. They include a card that shows you have to put them away. I guess I could cut that down and put that inside the case.I initially came here to give this a 4 star review but after typing my thoughts I think 3 1/2 would be more appropriate. It feels so close to perfection though, I like it.

This broke after just a couple of weeks of having it. Was not abused. It was a slow build crack that ultimately broke through once they asked me to give them the s# on it. There was none. Just said “made in China” Reported it to Oculus support on November 3rd. After going back and forth with oculus support, now a month and a half later they want me to box it up and send it back. Done wasting my time with them. Very frustrating piece of junk. They had so many failures they pulled them off the shelves. Very poor customer service.UPDATE: they did end up sending another one later on. It broke just like the original one did. Not good quality at all. I purchased a knock-off version and I could get three for the price of this junk.

This strap is great, but only for the small time that it lasts. It definitely helped with headaches and pressure on my face. However, we only had it for 2 weeks and it snapped completely in half WHILE playing. For $50 it’s an absolute shame that it only survived 2 weeks. We are super careful with the oculus and never throw it around or move around like crazy with it on. It is always stored away properly. So for this to snap with little wear and tear is absolutely crazy!

Broke while using it as directed, plastic band on the sides are very weak and are unable to handle the tension. It just went ""bleh"" and it was broke - no snapping, or breaking sound - just ""bleh"" and fell apart.  Lasted only 2 weeks, Oculus won't replace it cause it was through Amazon.  Also bought a Elite Strap with Battery which finally was delivered direct from Oculus and it broke in the same exact way in 2 weeks as well.  DO NOT BUY THIS!  Find another option!Also, doesn't work with the Anker Wireless Magnetic Charger, always have to fiddle with the wireless charger port to get it to snap. without this strap, works fine.The Elite Strap with Battery definitely doesn't work with the Anker Wireless Magnetic Charger as the straps battery cable gets in the way.Seriously, don't buy this.  It isn't worth your trouble and if you do decide to punish yourself, just buy it from Oculus so you can get a warranty replacement on it every time it breaks.

Despite there being numerous cheaper alternatives available, I decided to shell out the $80 for this product because I wanted the best cable available, and everything I read suggested that the official Link cable from Oculus was a good choice with its light weight, highly flexible design enabled by fiber optic data lines. What I received in the mail however was NOT the official Link cable from Oculus, but instead a cheaper copper-based knock-off!The knock-off works fine, but it's not what I ordered. If I wanted a cheaper cable I would have ordered a cheaper cable, and I *certainly* wouldn't have paid $80 for it!Personally, I plan to return the product I was shipped and instead buy a new one directly from Oculus, so as to avoid the possibility of me receiving a counterfeit a second time.If you do decide to order this product from Amazon, be sure to check the following upon arrival:1) Make sure the product arrives in the official white box pictured in the product description, and NOT in the cheap plastic bag whose photo I've attached to this review.2) Make sure the cable has the Oculus logo stamped on the straight plug as shown in the product photos, and does NOT have a small hole in the plug as shown in the photo I've attached to this review.Note that as a result of this scam, many of the other reviews on this product may actually be reviewing a different product than the official one sold by Oculus, and may not reflect the quality of the product you'll receive if you manage to obtain a genuine cable, so keep that in mind.

You would expect that spending almost $50  for a strap to improve the comfort would actually improve the comfort.

I wanted to like this product. I would have happily paid twice as much for it if it actually worked like you expect it to. Sadly, looks can be deceiving.Pros: Its a gorgeous looking product! Packaging. Style. Small zipper footprint. Subtle Oculus logo. Smooth strap. It his every checkbox. Overall, from the Amazon pictures, it appears to be a simply-designed high fashion product that should keep your equally well-designed Oculus 2 product stylishly safe and portable.Cons: Execution of the design is an absolute mess. The problems start with its super thin cardboard like material that makes up the shell. It not only has a cheap hollow sound but the feel of the gray exterior is rough and irritating. I was totally amazed at how badly this clamshell style fit together. Its not a well aligned zipped connection that you think it would be but rather two poorly formed halfs which destroy the aesthetics since they thin and never really align right. It would be like owning a zip lock plastic container and trying cram a spare lid from a different brand on. Its never really going to fit well. The problem continues on the inside with it awkward layout of goggles to controllers and wasted interior space at the front of the headset (like a square peg in a round hole). About the only rewarding aspect to the interior is the backend headrest to keep the goggles level. Lastly, even when zipped that perfect parting line created by the zipper is non-resistant. One light touch on the lid and it basically falls into itself has it not like a hard suitcase connection but a long piece of flexible material.Overall this product goes down in flames as the best looking failure I've purchases in a long time.

This is a known issue and Oculus had suspended shipping in 2020 because of it.This strap failed about 6 weeks after we received it in January 2021.  This was after the Amazon return window closed - which is a shame. Amazon has a streamlined process to handle these issues - Oculus does not.  Took them a week for a live person to respond to the warranty inquiry.  Only a response- no resolution yet.Updated - still waiting on Occulus to ship the replacement. Seems very strange since this is a known issue and required them to stop shipping product for a time.Amazon ( not Occulus) - stepped up an replaced the broken strap in March. Kudos to Amazon for covering for a poor supplier.  Problem is - they replaced with another one of the bad production lot straps.

I'm like you. I saw all the reviews about it breaking, but wanted to get the name brand strap because it felt more reliable than third party. I committed to being extremely careful with it. If the oculus was not on my head, it was in a secure case and on a shelf out of harms way. It was never dropped, abused, bent, twisted, strained, or otherwise tested. I got it out yesterday to play at home the first time since getting back from college and it was just... broken. I had not opened it since at college a few weeks ago. It rides in the car securely in its case, with extra padding completely filling the inside of the case, in its own seat, surrounded by pillows and blankets. It's ridden this way in my car countless times. Yet when I opened it up, it had somehow managed to break while in the safest conditions it could possibly be in . It's not a matter of if, but when will your strap break. Don't but it until they have fixed the design and guarantee returns.The strap worked great, and I found myself playing a lot more VR with the improved comfort, but I wish I had saved myself time and gone third party.

Reasons for 1 star review:- This cable does not work where their ultra short charging cable works (meaning my PC setup is fine, their cable isn't).- Using this cable, my PC doesn't even recognise my Oculus Quest 2 is connected.- So far Oculus/Facebook support had weren't useful.- In Web forums I found 0 solutions and a lot of frustrated people.- The *worst*: The only reason I convinced myself to buy the Oculus Quest 2 is because I understood I could connect it to my PC hardware. Now all I'm left with is a glorified Oculus Go with a small variety of 30$ 1990 Nokia games.Considering all of the above, I never paid so much on a cable and it hurts. I also never had such an important feature on hundreds of dollars worth of hardware just not work, fresh and new out of the box.P.s.,My PC rig is very modern, very strong and very new.

 I really did like the new head strap for the quest 2. What I did not like was the fact that it only took 30 days and one week for it to break I’m very disappointed, very disappointed with  this especially that I shelled out $50 for this. And it happened so soon after, of my purchase, in February. When I looked at the return date it said the window of return had closing March 14. Very angry. I don’t know if this was sitting in the warehouse for quite some time or not. Maybe they don’t Schechter items before they ship them out. but this is unbelievable to me that this could happen in such a short amount of time.

I should have just trusted my gut and gotten an HTC Vive. The Quest 2 is woefully lacking content so you need to buy this POS cable to use the Rift app on a real PC. Then the rub is that almost all the apps that are sold on the Rift store aren't compiled to work on the Quest natively, and vice versa. For example, if you bought Beatsaber from the Rift store, you don't get a version that works with the Quest 2, even though it's the same Oculus account. So you have to buy everything again for the Quest 2, or be forced to play tethered to your PC which was the whole point of getting the Quest 2. And then there's all the add on's like a head strap that actually works, Rx lens inserts so you don't break your glasses or scratch lenses, useful battery life packs, no slip controller grips, swapable face gasket liners so you don't share a sweat soaked mask with everyone else. The list goes on and on. Unbelievably sleezy corporate greed, but what else can you expect from Suckerberg.

For 49.00 I would have hoped for a much more comfortable experience. The stock strap is absolutely horrible if you want to use your Oculus for more than an hour at a time. I purchased this strap in hopes that1. it would be more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. and2. it would be easier to mount an external battery to it.I got 50% of what I was hoping for. Mounting the VR Power 2 battery to this strap is much easier than mounting to the stock strap, however the Elite strap is just as uncomfortable as the stock strap. Within 30 minutes or so I have to remove the VR headset and readjust it to take pressure off my forehead and temples. After 60 minutes I start to get a headache from pressure and have to take a break. This makes it hard to play in VR poker tournaments that can sometimes last hours at a time. Since I just purchased this I'll keep looking for that sweet spot on the adjustment and hope I find it, but until then I definitely have regrets on buying this strap. Will update review if it gets better.

At first, I was liking the Elite Strap over the standard one because it really did help with balancing the weight better. Then I became quite cautious when in the middle of playing Beat Saber with my sister, she announced that her Elite Strap had suddenly broken on the right side. Well, that was a shock to us both. We're not irresponsible or rough-handling kids. We're 40 and 50-years-old and take very good care of our possessions. But as a precaution, from that moment on, I became extra careful by making sure that I never handled or carried mine using the side straps. It's not something that I was doing regularly anyway and neither was my sister, but I was sure to remind myself to be conscientious about it. Now a smidge over 2 weeks after her incident, my Elite Strap has broken on the left side. It's almost cracked all the way through vertically and horizontally there is fracturing on the top left side edge that's no less than 6"" long. Had I not noticed the cracks tonight while taking a break, it likely would not have lasted through the weekend. When I buy a $50 item like this, I expect it to last. From all of the reviews, I am appalled to see that this is a common issue which makes me wonder why Amazon is continuing to sell this item knowing that it's poorly made and that there are so many complaints about this same type of defect? How can Amazon in good faith sell junk over and over again and be okay with that? I haven't even had the dang thing for 2 months yet! Thirty days be damned! Somebody's giving me my money back!

Functionally this upgraded strap with an external battery is well designed and easy to use. The strap attaches to the quest 2 securely and the battery housed in the rear balances the weight of the vr unit against the rear stabilizing strap with barely any noticeable added weight to top strap. The cable connecting the external battery to the quest 2 is good quality and the right length to fit the unit to the strap with no issues. The battery life on the quest 2 is rather disappointing but this product is a viable solution, I would recommend to anyone from casual gamer to more advanced.

Solid strap. I just got the elite strap, not the battery pack etc. The strap that comes with the Quest 2 is actually decent, not nearly as bad as the strap that came with my HTC Vive 3+ years ago.Elite Strap took seconds to install, very rigid and holds solidly on my head while playing intense games like Beat Saber and Blade and Sorcery(SteamVR).I would not say its a necessary upgrade but if you get blurred vision after playing these more intense type VR games then maybe its worthwhile to upgrade then.The strap does pivot upwards to wear it, but I wish it would pivot higher up even... still I dont think its a problem from the strap but the headset itself.

I hope there are better aftermarket cases out there cause this one is pretty poor for the price.Pros:The material is okThat’s about itCons:The zipper sucks. It’s too small and feels awkward opening and closing it.It’s not all that sturdy. Sturdy enough to survive a fall, sure, but I could also crush this thing with my barefoot and fling it across the room like the cardboard box that it is.If you can solve the riddle that is fitting the controllers in the center holder in less than 5 minutes I’ll buy you a steak dinner. Whoever designed that should be on Saturday Night Live because they’re hilarious.The size of the case isn’t utilized. The headset sits in there with lots of wiggle room, and there’s a small round thing for the charger and cable. The charger is a rectangular block guys. The holder for it is a roundish compartment. It fits weird, because those shapes don’t fit together well. And they somehow managed to leave too little room to put anything else useful in that compartment.My last con is a somewhat unfair one, but I would love to have a case that allows you to also charge the headset somehow. At the end of the day, your oculus quest 2 will be on the charger. Because it’s awesome, and you’re going to use it. It would be nice if I could leave it in its case when not in use, instead of sitting on the desk.Dear Oculus, when you design a better case (and I know you will, cause you guys can design good stuff, the headset is awesome) please send one my way to replace this awful one I overpaid for.

Slower and heavier than the 3rd party cable I got for $38. After running a few tests, there is no discernable improvement in quality or durability compared to 3rd party products. You could buy a very short 3.0 USB-C to USB-A and connect it to a 10 ft 3.0 USB-A extension cord for a fraction of the price and get better speeds with a more cost-effective long-term system. Alternatively, if you have fast enough internet and a nice router, you can just buy Virtual Desktop for $20 and go completely wireless.

We have had our Oculus Quest 2 for about 2 weeks now and we love it. Our two complaints were battery life and comfort. This headband rectifies both of those issues.The Quest 2 battery lasts about 2 hours; this headband increases that significantly. I can't tell you how long because we haven't depleted it yet.The factory headstrap isn't terrible, but this one is definitely better and much easier to adjust. Being that it is made by Meta/Oculus, it fits perfectly which is nice.I would say this is a must-have upgrade for the Quest 2. The Anker charging station is the other one.

I used this for a few hours then took it off and put the strap that came with the Quest 2 back on.  This one did hold the unit a little more firmly to my face but it was to the point of discomfort.  Mainly my issue, though, was that I wear glasses.  Since the strap that comes with the unit stretches I can pretty easily pull the thing off and on when I need to.  There's no stretch at all in this one so once you're screwed in by turning a knob on the back, you're not getting out quickly, and when I'm futzing around trying to get Steam games working over Virtual Desktop I seem to have to be doing that quite a bit, so this one just wasn't practical.

This thing is awful, plain and simple.  Want to feel like you have your head in a vice grip?  Want MORE prominent lines on your face after a playthrough?  Want to make the headset more difficult to store, risk damaging the side speaker ports during installation, and pay $50 for the experience?!?  THEN HAVE WE GOT THE ELITE STRAP FOR YOU!  Enhanced comfort and support?  Only if you consider increasing your neck pain as increasing your comfort.  I'm dumbfounded as to how this was ever produced, as it was clearly never tested pre-production.I bought this stupid thing because I was enjoying my Quest 2 so much I actually wanted to play longer and thought this ""enhanced support"" headset would make the headset more comfortable so I could easily do so.  At first (first 30 seconds) I was like, ""wow, I can see how this thing IS more comfortable!""  Then the neck pain started from the base of my skull, radiating outward.  I thought I had it positioned poorly or something?  Nope.  No matter how you adjust this thing, you can't make it comfortable for longer than 30 seconds.  It redirects the stress of wearing the headset and puts it all on your neck.  I was actually having a mental battle telling myself, ""you'll get used to it, just keep wearing it, just keep wearing it.""I would liken wearing this POS to wearing bad ice skates.  You know they're supposed to be somewhat uncomfortable and people keep telling you things that don't reduce the pain, like, ""they're supposed to be tight,"" and it's not until you get a pair that kinda fits you that you're like, ""man that pair I was wearing was awful!""  This ""elite"" strap is that bad pair of ice skates.  Unless you've used the original flexible strap that comes with the Oculus, wearing this thing would make you write off Oculus and never want to play again.Putting BACK the ORIGINAL flexible strap that came with the Oculus fixed everything.  Now, I'm gonna see if I'm allowed to return this POS or if I'm stuck with it.  Guess I could use it as a vice grip in my shop, if nothing else?

I don't think the Official link cable is worth it after using it, especially because when you go tethered after being wireless, you really feel inconvenienced and totally RUINS INMERSSION, so get yourself a wifi 5/6 router (for the same price that this thing costs) and set up Airlink or virtual desktop.Also when using this cable with SteamVR games, It's all laggy when I open up the oculus link menu.Also, I would not recommend anyone without a USB C port to get this cable as a means to play PCVR games. First off, this thing does NOT include a USB A adapter. Secondly, your Quest 2 will most likely discharge if you use an adapter because it won't get the 3 amps that it requires, so you will have 2-3 hour playing sessions at max. What I recommend is: get a third-party strap with a battery, or get a battery pack and a Wifi 6 router and enjoy the best of both worlds. This product is definitely overpriced for what it does compared to other solutions. NOT recommended.If ever you are looking for a link cable, get yourself a third-party one that could even include a USB A adapter.

The solid head straps (this Elite Strap included) are usually going to offer a much better experience than soft head straps because the headset does not shift with motion as much. This reduced shifting translates to less motion sickness and an overall clearer experience. When playing active games, it is highly recommended to have the headset as rigidly secured as comfortably possible. This particular strap is what I have on my Quest 2. It has an adjustment nob on the back to get a firm tightness dialed in while on the head, foam padding to reduce unwanted pressure spots, and a top band with Velcro to set the sitting height. This strap is easy to adjust on the fly and has worked well for demoing as most users can quickly set their desired tightness without the need for the height adjustment and get on with playing.

This thing is freaking adorable and classy looking. I love the felt texture, the hidden zipper, and the whole look of it. It gives off kind of a futuristic vibe, while still looking classy enough to not be out of place in high end homes.The interior is a bit problematic, however, in that it is specifically designed for the official Oculus accessories, and even then just barely. You'll find after having an Oculus for only a short period that you will be buying all sorts of accessories for it. New head straps, face padding, chargers, etc. None of that stuff will fit in this case. The case is just large enough for your headset with its original fabric headstrap, the controllers, and the charging cables. Anything more than that, and you have to start getting really creative. I have managed to get it to fit the Elite headstrap and an additional silicone face cover as well as a couple of extra cables for other accessories, but it's tight.Basically, this looks nice and would be a good travel case for minimal setup, but if you hope to use it as a 100% home storage solution, it's probably not going to cut it unless you are just a minimalist by nature and also happy with the standard Oculus equipment. I prefer the Kiwi headstrap, which absolutely will not fit in this case. So I really won't be using it unless I travel with my Oculus, and that is not likely to happen much. I probably would have just saved my money and not gotten this case had I known at the time of purchase which accessories Id want versus which will fit in this case. But I can hardly blame the case for that.

So, the Quest 2 is able to be sold for so cheap, due to a bunch of cost cutting decisions that they made, including the fact that the default strap, and the general type of strap used with the Quest 2 are utter garbage. To get a decent fit, you need to tighten the included strap like crazy and crush the headset against your face, which is extremely uncomfortable.This ""premium"" version is only a barely noticeable improvement over the stock strap. For all of the billions of dollars that Facebook (I know they want to change their name, but it will never not be Facebook, in the same way that Alphabet is only known as Google) has, they couldnt design a premium strap that is properly comfortable. This should have been the included strap with the headset, as it looks and feels cheap anyways, it may have increased the bill of materials for the final product by like... $2 at most? I doubt they are selling the Quest 2 for a profit anyways, so I dont know why they didnt want to try to actually impress to some degree. You still need to crush the headset against your face for it to fit well and stay put.You know that Facebook has failed the market when the 3rd party accessories sell a MASSIVE amount more than the official stuff, and that people rave about the 3rd party accessories. Its not a mark of shame to have the 3rd party stuff, instead, its a mark of shame to have the official items.Go get a nice halo-style strap from a 3rd party manufacturer. I will almost guarantee that it will be many times more comfortable and well designed. The halo straps dont actually push the headset against your face, they just hold it in front of your face, so you dont have nearly as much problem with comfort.

I bought this cable thinking I would have a better experience than using Airlink. I recently got the oculus quest two and upgraded from the oculus rift. So I’m used to using a cable and I don’t mind it however there’s simply no point in spending $80 on this useless overpriced garbage. if you have a 5 GHz Wi-Fi connection then just use air link. The cable does not charge your headset while playing, and there is no noticeable improvement over Airlink. In fact my VR experience is worse using this cable. I thought there would be less than the occasional stutter I get with Airlink and better latency using the cable. But every game across-the-board performs worse when using the oculus link cable. there is also a black screen glitch that happens pretty often when are using the link cable. The glitch happens once or twice every time I play and I’m not sure what causes it but basically whenever you boot up a game sometimes your entire display is just black. I do not have this issue with Airlink. When this glitch happens I have to restart my headset. There is already a little bit of set up and inconvenient factors of playing VR so experiencing this glitch is a little frustrating when you just want to get in the game. So basically there is no noticeable improvements over Airlink and performance is actually worse with the cable.  my specs are rtx 2080 super, i7 9700k and 16gb of ram.

This headstrap is definitely an improvement over the jockstrap that comes with the Quest 2. However, it's baffling why this isn't the default strap as opposed to a $40 upgrade. To those that would make some comment about the Quest 2 already being a low price as it is, I don't think including the elite strap as the default would have been too much of a financial hit for Oculus since apparently the materials are very low quality (if previous reviews are anything to go off of).

This is nowhere near the comfort of the PSVR or Rift S halo straps. I love the halos for those headsets and was hoping to add that same level of comfort to my Quest2 but that is not what I got. The attachments to the speakers is janky at best and there is almost no adjustment for where the headset sits on your face with this strap. It doesn't transfer the weight very well either, during play the headset is constantly sliding down my face slowly. I've tried all sorts of adjustments on the top strap and halo tightness but it's never worked better than the Q2 elite strap from oculus. On top of all that the band of the halo strap blocks my headphones from sitting in the right place on my head so I can't use my good headphones for VR with this strap. The quality is definitely there and I will buy another one if they fix some of these design issues but in its current state it just is not there yet.

When I first bought this, it was much better than the original head strap that the headset came with.  It was more comfortable and provided a more secure fit to my head.  After a while though I noticed that when looking around, it would easily come loose.  Just the weight of the headset alone seems to loosen the strap when looking around quickly.  The wheel on the back that tightens the strap doesn't seem to have the strength to stay tight even from just a light tug on the headset.  Ideally, that wheel should be the only way to tighten and loosen it.  I shouldn't be able to lightly pull on the thing and have it loosen up.  Kind of makes it worthless as the whole point of VR is to look around and be surrounded by your environment.  So, that's my experience with it.So, 3 stars since it seems to be built well and fits nicely.  It worked well in the beginning.  Much better than the original strap, but I'll need to find a way to make this thing stay tight on my head.

As a link cable and to use SteamVR it works fine, however, it does not charge / slow down discharge for the Quest 2 AT ALL. The headset died in less than 2 hours, which was quite annoying and forced me to end gaming sessions / VR Raves far too early.After a quick Google search, I found that TONS of people were having the same issue. some possible solutions offered were purchasing a Type A adapter and plugging it into a USB 3.0 type slot on your computer, however that did not work out for me.I ended up purchasing an Anker powerline USB 3.0 type c cable and it works faaaarr better at 1/4 of the price. I attended a 5 1/2 VR chat rave and the Quest 2 battery percentage barely reached 70%. I am very impressed with the Anker cable and deeply regret purchasing the Oculus link cable.if you need a link cable for your quest 2, go with the Anker powerline type c cable.

We do not use our headsets very much, maybe 3 to 4 hours a month. We purchased 2 elite straps and this one is falling apart.  The side of the solid plastic support is cracking in multiple places and is no longer able to be used.  It's most likely a factory defect since my other elite strap is still mint condition despite being used the same amount as the defective one.  I guess just be cautious when purchasing and look it over thoroughly before using.

This product does what it is supposed to do and it does it well.The price is a bit steep in my opinion but it is a high quality cable and delivers very fast transfer speeds.As others have stated, you will need a usb c connection on your pc to take advantage of the high speed transfer rates. Using an adapter to usb 3 will throttle the connection but it does work. I used an adapter at first and then installed a true usb c port on my PC. The difference was noticeable to me.The one thing to bear in mind with this cable is that it is heavy and subject to getting twisted up.I would highly recommend using a cable support system to suspend the cable from the ceiling or another high point so that the cable does not drag while you are playing.Better yet, use SideQuest and Virtual Desktop to run a wireless connection. You will need this cable in order to connect wirelessly so definitely pick one up.

This Product is a waste of money. I'm upset that I bought it. It performs worse than third party cables, and has the added deficit of only being a type c to type c connection. Type c is a horrible connection especially for vr you are moving all the time and the poor grip from the type c connection will loose. The quest 2 is a great product, but this chord is not, and I would recommend a third parties chord. One with usb 3 to type c.

The battery life supplements normal use very well: you get an indicator of Oculus battery as well as the % of the extended battery which is very useful. It also doesn't have the problems 3rd party batteries have where you have issues with Oculus using the available power efficiently (or at all occasionally). In short, it just works.The strap sucks so hard. It very brittle. It is SO UNCOMFORTABLE. I can't overstate that enough. It was so uncomfortable that I didn't even want to play. You can't slip it on and off like you can with the fabric straps. They are also super anti consumer and have glued the entire elite strap together. You can't disassemble it without breaking something off. I saw screws and thought I could disassemble it; WRONG. They're there for appearances only. You have to break this thing to take it apart which means it's a paper weight after warranty, or if you aren't covered by warranty like if you buy from a 3rd party seller or ebay.I ended up cutting the straps off and I velcro strapped the battery to my fabric harness. It is way more compact now, more comfortable to wear and I get a better battery for AirLink use.

I bought this after oculus restarted selling them after they paused to address breaking issues.  I thought they would’ve sorted it out by then but less than a month of using it it broke in a similar way as others have reported.  I think what finally did it was when I was trying to tighten it for someone with a much smaller head then mine.  After they finished using it the crack appeared.  Besides the cracking issue it has so much better than the standard strap.  I was able to workout with supernatural which requires a lot of physical movement without the oculus moving around so much.  Since I sent my elite strap back i went back to using the standard strap to workout with supernatural and the amount of motion it has while working out makes me feel sick.  You have to do squats in the game and sway side to side and for me without the elite strap it was unbearable.  I’m in search of another strap that won’t break.  Currently waiting for the eyglo strap that had the same cupping concept behind the head as the elite strap.  I believe that played an important factor in how it limited the oculus from swaying around while working out.

One of the side plastic parts had broken after a few months of light use, around a dozen uses in total. Oculus is aware of the quality issue (just google ""broken quest 2 elite strap""), but won't ship the replacement part to a ""warehouse"" address and won't explain why.I'm basically forced to pay full price for another copy of the same item, which makes the already expensive part waaay too expensive.Going with a 3rd party alternative this time - hopefully these are made from higher quality materials...Super disappointed with their support.Whoever is interested in the details:I live abroad and, while I can easily buy the part from Amazon, Oculus provides support.They won't ship abroad even at my expense and I don't have a residential address in the US, so my only solution to use a 3rd party service that has a US address and can forward the package abroad.For some reason they treat this address as ""warehouse address"" and refuse to ship there, leaving me with no solution.FWIW, the support people are very nice, but they just repeat ""can't do anything without a residential address"".

9 out of 10 for comfort....1 out of 10 for durability.Looks like just preaching to the choir now..but the original strap was such a nuisance I told myself I would go with the elite strap and be ""very careful""...despite all the cracked strap reviews (folks must be shortcutting the loosing to take off part and getting  too aggressive).  Thought it was a game changer...very comfortable and easy adjusting between different folks.  Recommended to many. But then it happened...snapped like a potato chip after 2 months of use...shocked me because it really wasn't getting stressed when it snapped.  You would think for the price it cost they could use a more durable material ( i swear is must have be purferated the way it snapped)  Now I wish I would have used a strong duct tape to give the straps some reinforcement skin to prevent this ( though im not sure how much more life that would have bought me)  Back with the awful original strap until I can find a better more durable alternative..not going to burn another $50 with this again.

My husband and I both got Oculus as an early Christmas present from my in laws. Mine had this strap but my husband's did not.After trying both the standard elastic one and this solid one we both agree that the elastic one give us pressure headaches if we play for any slightly long period of time.But not this solid one. It adapts better to your head without having to setting up super tight to keep your eyes in the right position. Oculus have a very specific spot in the googles that your eyes should be lined up with to see things well and not blurry. So with the elastic one there's no wiggle room. Either you put it very tight so it stays in a good position or it tends to move around (causing everything to look slightly blurry) while you play.If you get headaches or have issues with the standard elastic strap I highly recommend buying this one. It helps a lot.I get headaches very easily (sunglasses, headbands, headphones, etc ) and this strap really makes a difference.

Only had this for a little over three months and just noticed a crack n the band. You can see it in the photo provided. I am afraid to use it now for fear of it breaking it completely. I am now forced to go back to the  original cloth head strap, which I found uncomfortable and difficult to keep the headset in place.I would like to return it for a refund so I can hopefully find a head strap that I can trust. It just seems it is not a matter of if, but a matter of when one of these straps will break. For some reason, I no longer have a link in my previous orders list to instigate the procedure. Also, I cannot find a contact link to the seller either.Now it is just a matter of whether I can find someone to fix this issue.

What makes this strap different than the original is that in the back - there is a turn know (like a construction hardhat) that allows you to tighten or loosen the strap.  I like the design but it is not designed for people with 'fat heads' (I'm 6""6"" adult male) and the pressure on my cheek bones (even at the 'most open' setting) was too much.I wish they would include a 'max suggest' size so that you can know in advance if it will work for you.  OR maybe if they made other sizes!?

This is exactly what I expected and what I needed. I had bought the Vive custom audio strap and it was big and bulky and would not fit in any of my cases. I had bought it for the head phones that come with it but now that I have my gaming chair, I don't need the head phones. If I need to be quite and not make any noise I can always use my Bluetooth headset, which fits comfortably around my VR headset. I prefer the chair because of the extra entertainment value and the way it sounds that also includes vibration.The Elite strap now fits perfectly in my case and I was able to secure the VR Power battery onto it with no issues. The battery actually sits much better on this strap because of the way it sits on the strap. I can push it down into the case in the center of the strap as opposed to the Vive custom audio strap that was stationary and was not possible to move down into the case and thereby making it positioned to high for the case to close. All in all, this is what you want for a perfect fit into the case, a more comfortable fit, because it's lighter and just fits around my head much more ergonomically. Last but not least, it has the adjustment knob indented into the back part of the strap. This is important for it to fit just right into the case. Don't cheap out and buy any of the Frankenstien versions of this strap. The knob on the back sticks out making it more of a challenge to fit into a case. I hope this helps. Rock on!Update: Wow! This keeps getting better and better. I've found that while using my stand for the Oculus, it's much easier to take on and off the stand. As I continue to use it I find other advantages. I've discovered that the control wheel on the back that's used to adjust the fit around your head works much faster. I can adjust the fit in a matter of seconds as opposed to the Vive, which was harder to turn the knob, took more turns to adjust the right fit. The adapter that's required for the Vive kept sliding off if you tightened it to much. I had to wrap velcro around it to keep in place but even then, it would slide off just not as easy. I just thought I would add this information to help you make a better buying decision. This is really a no-brainer. I know I'm siting but for those that are standing, I would seriously consider buying a good set of headphones, or hooking it up to your home theater receiver thru Bluetooth.

I purchased one of these to try it out, and was at first quite happy, as the fit was much better than the included elastic strap. I quickly purchased another and that was our defacto strap for our two Oculus Quest 2s. I did noticed that it was fatiguing on the eyes/face/temples, so I bought a third-party ""forehead"" strap, which I prefer; my kids prefer the Elite Strap.Unfortunately, I can say that after a few months of use, one of the Elite Straps snapped. Thankfully, we had the spare, since I was using the third party one. I have been attempting to repair the broken one with some epoxy and plastic supports this weekend. As I did so, I examined the other Elite Strap. It, too, had split halfway on one side! For a $50 strap, this seems a poor design, and I definitely won't be replacing either with a new Elite Strap. The third party one is working like a champ, so that's where my money will be going.

Does the trick, better than the strap the quest 2 comes with. Not the best balance, doesnt completely balance the front woth the back weight but if you did want that much weight overall on your head it would start to feel too heavy if you wanted the front and back of quest 2 to be completely weight balanced. Battery status of this unit can be seen in game along with quest 2 status too, which is nice. But it wont last as long as some random battery bank you buy on amazon.

Broke after a couple of months of use. Same story you read from others. The left side started cracking and eventually it broke. Now I am in contact with Oculus to get a replacement, hopefully. Too bad Im beyond the 30 days for a refund. I would advise others to seek out other straps from 3rd parties. The Elite Strap is more comfortable than the default one, but in my experience, there was still some noticeable discomfort, specially because it doesnt support the front portion of the headset that well, and it weighs down on your forehead. However, it is easier and faster to put on than the original strap thanks the dial on the back. If you are a glass wearer like me, I can say it's not that much more comfortable than the original, and because this weighs on your forehead, you will want to tighten it a bit more to your face so it's not dangling, which will push your glasses back and into your eye sockets. It all depends on the size and shape of your head, and how big your glasses are, but my head is average, and I got small glasses to play VR, and I still had issues. Like I said, look into 3rd party alternatives.

This gets a 1 star.. No way in heck this item was quality tested. No sir.. We've all been the idiot who disregarded people's comments thinking the error was on the user.. But this product here has some real flaws. Mainly from the long hard plastic strap that connects the headset itself, to the circular crank in the back..Unless you want to be the annoying guy who is always lecturing people on how to take on and off the headset properly, then this isn't for you.. We brought this product to easter this year, and it passed through many folks hands, without the disclaimer of ""Blah blah blah you have to put it on and take it off like this blah blah blah"". Let alone, i'm not going to spend my evening cracking down on people putting it on and taking it off properly.. I'd rather not be annoying and just eat the $50 cost, which i have now done.TLDR- The strap is a hard plastic, where if you don't put it on or take it off properly, it will crack. Ours had 1 major crack after the night, and a plethora of spider cracks all the way up and down the strap.A family member replaced it after they found out it was broken at the party, i told them to return it and keep their money cause the product isn't worth it.. Survived about 2 months with just me, and only 1 family function.. Back to the stock strap which is the better strap at the end of the day.. Sad..

The USB-C cable ecosystem is a mess and it's hard to find proper cables for linking Oculus, or to know whether a given generic cable would work; this one's primary value is that we know it will work for sure. I would recommend trying something cheaper but from a known brand, and then relying on a seller's return policy if it does not work out. I will say that the wired Link experience that this cable enables is OK, but I think a completely wireless (AirLink) situation would be much, much better. If your home wifi isn't fancy/new enough to support Airlink though, then a cable like this one will be needed. I would recommend a cable like this to every Oculus Quest 2 owner who also PC games as it is very neat. Again, this is guaranteed to work which is why I spent the money, but there are much cheaper alternatives.

This strap was pretty sweet for a few months. I preordered it with my quest. It’s way more comfortable than the elastic cloth strap that comes with the headset, and it fit over my gargantuan head with glasses pretty easily. Which was a huge relief. Then people started reporting them breaking. So, naturally, I started babying the heck out of it. At this point I was sure it was going to be okay, but better safe than sorry, right? Finally, the day after Christmas, I go to put it on and I notice it’s feeling pretty loose and unstable. BOOM! Right by the back where it tightens, it’s hanging on by a thread and looks like a cracked window. So that sucks.

Got this so I could develop VR apps on my Quest 1 running the Unity dev environment on my PC for fast scene iteration and play exclusive Rift / Steam VR games.I had bought some other compatible Link cables before the official Oculus cable was available/in stock which worked but these cables were a lot less convenient as they were fairly inflexible and shorter at around 10ft so I felt tethered to the PC by something that could do double duty towing fully laden oil tankers.The Oculus cable worked great initially, plugged into a powered USB C expansion card so it was able to keep the headset charged even during heavy use and was flexible so there wasn't the same degree of annoying drag on the headset. The Oculus PC app also reported I was getting full USB 3.2 speeds so performance was spot on.My issue is similar to other reviewers, I wasn't super careful with this cable and recently saw a right angle kink in the cable where it probably got caught under something and then yanked or bent. When I foolishly tried to straighten it out I felt/heard a nasty ""tink"" noise, which I assume was one or more of the fiber optic cables cracking and now the cable doesn't work correctly.I'd love to replace my broken cable with another Oculus Link cable as it really is the best wired Oculus Link experience I've tried but at $80 (or ~$70 on sale) every time I or my family is momentarily careless around one of these cables that could turn into a really expensive hobby so I'm probably switching back to the cheaper, heavier, slower but more robust cables unless I can get AirLink working?

Oculus has not yet fixed their quality control issues with this headstrap. There are alternative and highly reviewed straps available here and you should steer clear from this product. Not only because it will break, but because the replacement process is arduous for a product with known defects.My headstrap broke within a week of normal use, down the center of the left piece. I contacted Oculus customer service and proceeded to be asked to provide a picture of the broken strap, the serial number, the serial number of my Quest 2, my name and address, and several bits of personal info. I was handed from one rep to the next and sent 7 emails over the course of a month to get a replacement.Instead, they sent me a friggin code to print out a shipping label and ship back the strap after all that and asked me to provide my own shipping package. No. I'm not finding my own box, printing a label, and taking 15 minutes of my day to head to the Post Office because of how terrible you're product is.

I have seen that this is a common issue with the elite headstrap. It snapped right at the connection point.

I have tried using the official cable since day 1 with Steam VR, but it is consistent in disconnecting me at random only to ask if I want to enable the link again from the Quest Home. I have searched online and none of the solutions currently available resolve this issue. I bought a third party cable for a fraction of the price and have not had any issues with it dropping me like this, but I sacrifice the ability to fast charge while playing and no access to my mic for speaking to others. In doing this, this confirms for me that the issue is the cable itself. I do not recommend the official cable for the quest 2.

I bought this and have tried to make it work for 2 months now… and I’ve absolutely failed. The zipper (CHEAP) is constantly snagging due to the shape and design of this container. The zipper also, if that wasn’t bad enough, has an extra small strap on it meant, I guess, to make zipping easier, but with how small and thin it is, and with how often the zipper snags... what it really seems to be made to do is cut into your hand and/or fall apart at any second.And if any of this wasn’t enough, since the exterior is a fabric.. exterior which slowly but surely gets dirtier with no reliable/simple way to actually clean it.. making this day by day look worse and worse.Well it’s obvious that Oculus has an absolute blunder here.

You will want this cable over the unofficial link cables if you want low latency tracking. The fiber optics and fast two way data transfer rate make this cable the only choice for a quality VR experience with the quest 2. The differences are particularly noticeable on higher end hardware at 120hz, and in fast paced games like beat saber which was completely unplayable for me on expert + wirelessly with air link/ virtual desktop or with the unofficial link cables. Just be aware that this cable will not charge your headset, so gameplay time will be limited (heavily at 120hz to about 2 hours) but the quality is quite good after forcing bitrate to 500mbps and turning off dynamic bitrate in the oculus debug tool. There are almost no video compression artifacts present after doing this! A much better experience visually than wireless play and the only way to experience pcvr with solid tracking on the quest 2. I have yet to do quest 1 testing, but I assume the results would be similar.

We appreciated the comfort of this elite strap.  It was delivered to us in mid February and it's now early May and the strap just literally snapped.  We aren't hard on our equipment and we take care of all the components.

As others have mentioned the plastic is inferior and will break.  I assumed when I read about others issues that they were heavy users or were simply careless.  This I think however is simply the type of plastic that takes very little stress to fracture and you'll not have used it for a while and suddenly notice a new break in the side straps.  I'm an extremely light user and yet multiple breaks have appeared.  Its reasonably comfortable but thats of little use with this sort of quality.  (Updated to 1 star as the plastic has continually broken down.  Unless they've changed the plastic, AVOID!

The top negative reviews for this cable are laughable... They don't know what they are doing and don't understand modern technology... This cable will allow you to max your bitrate out in oculus debug tool to 500 mbps, making it exactly like a native display vr headset (oculus link compresses the video, etc.)... It will also allow you to keep 100% battery charge the entire time you are using it... I only use it for PCVR so the battery not draining is a huge plus.... Also the weight is half or more than any other non-fiberoptic cables... Have had this cable for over a year and it's the only one you need....

The cup design at the rear of the strap cradles your skull like a baby.  Love the sleek design and the inconspicuous knob for adjusting the fit.  Unlike other no name designs where it looks like a bulky knob, the Elite has it integrated with the design so you don't see it.

One of the most disappointing purchases I’ve made. This product was supposed to be a game changer in comfortability, it is listed in everybody’s “must have” accessories for the oculus quest 2. However I’ve only had mine for about 5 weeks and it clean snapped in half while I was putting it on. I hardly applied any stress to the straps, as I’m always careful with my oculus, but as you can see in the photo it just snapped while I was putting it on to play today. Not to mention I only play my quest for about 3-5 hours a week. There isn’t a single scratch on the headset as I try to take care of my things. The only explanation is that this is made from a pretty cheap plastic. It is very comfortable and noticeably stopped the headset from wobbling, but we are about 7 days outside of the 30 day warranty window. I would not buy this again. I’d rather try my luck with a 3rd party option that is cheaper.

I made this purchase because the standard battery life for the Oculus Quest 2 is subpar. I felt like I couldn't have any extended gaming session without having to plug my headset in and stand near the charger - a completely unintuitive way to play.Installation was very simple. You just unsnap the old head strap from the sides of the Oculus and remove the strap from the loop on top.Additionally, the Elite head strap fits much better on my head and is easier to adjust, thanks to the dial on the rear that you can twist to make it fit perfectly.The extended battery life is great. I wish this was included with the Oculus straight out of the box, but since it isn't, this is the best purchase for those seeking added battery life and comfort.

Very useful for streaming when Wi-Fi connection is poor or nonexistent. Hooked up to my PC with this cable, I can use Side Quest to cast to my computer and then connect an HDMI to the TV and everyone can see me play.

This strap works fine, but I quickly switched it out for the Kiwi strap and am far happier with that one. I will still be using this one when I travel because it fits in the official travel case, while the Kiwi strap does not. But for comfort level, this one just does not cut it. It works far better than the fabric strap the Oculus comes with, but the back is not large enough to really cup the back of the head and prevent the weight of the goggles from pressing down into your cheeks. As a result, wearing the device with this head strap causes face fatigue much faster than with the Kiwi strap.

The end that isn’t elbowed, the one meant to go Into the PC, yeah it’s super fragile.  I took steps to avoid a break with my second, but that didn’t save it.Save your money, buy a USB-C to USB 3 cable.  The ones with really high data transfer rates do a good job of keeping the headset charged as you play linked to your PC.  Your battery still drains but you’ll be fatigued well before that happens, trust me.  VR is best played in short stints anyways.

Pro: much more comfortable than the original head strap.Con: Like many others have reported this broke with under 50 hours of use. This has never been dropped, over tightened, or stored incorrectly. Around the 30 hour mark the back rubber head strap randomly detached (picture 1) after playing one day, but we continued to use it. Yesterday around the 50 hour mark the plastic band just broke while putting it on.In short: you would probably have better luck getting a different brand. I loved the headset before it broke, but an item of this price that breaks that easily, without any sort of rough handling, is not worth your money.

I wish this just came with the Quest 2 out of the box. it's worth the extra 50 bucks. With the cloth strap, the pain in my forehead would linger for a day. It's that much pressure. (Might also be that I have a big melon.) With the elite strap, the pressure is still there but it doesn't cause any pain. It sort of splits the pressure between your forehead and face. I'm definitely staying in VR longer and more comfortably with the Elite Strap. I wish the comfort was more like the PSVR where the headset sort of just hangs in front of your face and putting zero pressure anywhere but I understand that's probably not possible for a stand-alone device.I've read that it would probably be even better with the one that has a battery built in but I'm probably gonna get a third party battery.

This is definitely a much better and more comfortable setup than the soft strap. Where the soft strap went over and hurt my ears this takes most of the weight and distributes it evenly through the top rather than the sides. It’s much easier to adjust and take off and put on than the original soft strap that comes prepackaged with the Quest 2. If you wear your VR more than once in awhile this is a must have addition as it makes it much easier all around and more comfortable, allowing not only longer gaming sessions but peace of mind.

Avoid at all costs. Having gone through three of these things now, handling both with kid gloves to the point of absurdity, I've come to the conclusion that whatever process they use to manufacture these things is fatally flawed. They will snap on you eventually. It may take two weeks, two months or several, but there is a high chance they will break along the side, even if you treat them very delicately. They stopped selling them at the end of last year to fix the manufacturing process, or so they claim.

The Elite Strap functions well, and is a far better and more comfortable choice than the standard strap that ships with the Quest 2. However, I still find that I struggle to find a balance between too tight and too loose of a fit. I think some of the issue is balancing, and that can only be corrected with counterbalancing in the back to compensate for the weight of the unit in the front. So in retrospect I do wish I had purchased the battery pack model of the Elite Strap rather than the standalone model. The battery pack would provide a counter weight and also obviously provide more hours of use. Keeping that in mind I still give the strap a 4/5 because it functions as designed and does provide a significant upgrade to the stock strap.

I mean you will probably feel pain eventually if you are on it for freakin 10 hours a day. But for the average human being that touches grass and has a real life, this is excellent! All you need now is a battery pack so that your headset doesn't die so quick and it turns off right as you are on a poker match and YOU WENT ALL IN!

The unit fits nice and snug and it's well protected. Wish they'd other colors. I think it should be more like 25 bucks. I've read the reviews, I'm not sure what people are looking for, but I don't plan on sitting on it, or throwing it up against the wall. It functions well as a protective case. The only thing that was wrong with it was the zipper function, and the price. The unit does what it's supposed to do, protect your investment. It's the same with the elite headstrap, if you rip it off of your head rather than adjusting it by unscrewing it and removing it by grabbing the headset, of course it's going to break. It's not a pair of glasses it's a plastic strap. I cannot recommend this until they drop the price but it does do what it is supposed to do.

Pros:- The most compact way to carry the headset, controllers, charger with cable,  and spare batteries for the controllers.I even added a 5$ aftermarket strap padding to the headset - and it fits inside.- tough hard case, even the zipper is half internal and protected.- the carrying strap is positioned so that the case will be carried easily with one hand,  while keeping a low profile.Cons:- external and internal material that my cat likes to sharpen it's nails into...- the ""accessories"" compartment is a little too small, and can BARELY fit a 2A charger, 9 feet usb cable, and spare batteries for the controllers.- cannot contain any aftermarket replacement for the original ""Elite"" strap.Bottom Line:- definitely recommended (if you don't need extra room for ""halo"" or aftermarket ""elite"" strap) .- does exactly what it should,  in the most efficient way.- not buying a case for the headset - is like buying a 1,000$ smartphone and ""saving"" by not spending another 50$ on a good case...(Only for brave people)

This thing is made very poorly. Most of the design and build is ok, but the side pieces that connect it to the headset, are very cheap and weak. I have had mine barely over a month and the side piece cracked, very easily, rendering it useless. To put on or take it off, you have to snap the side pieces, over the pieces on the headset. You literally have to force it in and they made that part paper thin. I assume they did that on purpose. Amazon conveniently does not accept returns after 30 days. Don’t waste your money on this, buy a good one made by a small business.

3/17/21 *update:Today the strap broke in the 2nd spot. I've taped together with gaff tape until off brand head strap arrives. My elite strap must have been in the original batch with faulty material.I assume the majority of people breaking their Elite Straps are simply applying too much pressure. Granted, you do have to apply more pressure than you should have to especially if you wear glasses like me. Its a constant annoyance balancing/adjusting or removing the headset but no reason to exert more force than necessary. The Elite strap is infinitely better/more comfortable than the stock strap

This would be a great head strap if it were not defective. I just returned my second headset. I was putting it on with very little pressure and I heard a snap. The strap cracked again. The design is defective due to the material used for the side strap. It's just to delicate.

Funny thing is, this has been sitting in a VR storage box for a few weeks and it just became brittle and snapped like a thin cracker. NO blunt trauma, no twisting, no heat or pressure.

I just got an Oculus Quest 2 about a month and a half ago. Since it does not come with a case, I decided to pick this up to keep things organized. Overall, the case serves its purpose, but the quality leaves much to be desired. I know there is plastic in there, but it is so thin and lightweight that it almost feels like it's made of cardboard. Unfortunately, I tore off the packaging after it arrived, or else I would have returned this case back to Amazon. At a price point of $50, the quality just isn't what it should be.

This is a really expensive cable for what it is, but it's of good quality and works well.But when I pay $80 for a USB cable, to some degree I'm paying for confidence in the quality and a certain retail experience.

The Quest 2 Elite strap allows easy fitting of the headset. Just make sure that you turn the dial on the back to snuggly fit it to your head. If it is not on snuggly sometimes the software doesn't start properly. I found some articles that said to make sure it is on snuggly. Once I started doing this it always works the first time.

Stop reading, just go click on it.  This headstrap is weighted just right so that the headset is no longer front-heavy.  I never knew that the Quest 2 was too front-heavy until after I tried this strap.  It is an amazing difference.  Pro tip: Get a removable surface-mounted hook, and it hangs very nicely on the side of your desk (from this headstrap).(Update Feb22)  The strap is cracked in the same place that everyone else is mentioning.

While this cable is pretty good quality, I don't use it nearly enough to justify having ever bought it. It's great for when I want to keep playing or watching a movie, but need to be plugged in to charge back up. The length is generous and the cable itself doesn't feel cheap. However, I'm sure you can find cables that do the exact same thing at a much more reasonable price. $80 is A LOT for a cable that I never even use since I bought Virtual Desktop, which is only $20 and works very well while still allowing me to play wirelessly.If I were you, I'd find a much cheaper option and get Virtual Desktop instead.

Others have already mentioned the terrible zipper... while it's cool to have an invisible zipper for the look, it makes opening and closing the case a chore - until the zipper cord breaks and then it's easy because it's just open all the time.My bigger complaint is that I got an extension cord to allow charging while wearing the Oculus Quest II -- it doesn't fit.  I'm going for a roomier case with a better zipper.

This was the only case on the market so I got it, haven't really used it at all. Occulus fits when it is just the one out of the box, but if you put something else besides the straps on it to hold it on your head then it no longer fits in the case.If you play the occulus for any decent amount of time then you'll want to upgrade to something besides the straps it came with which then means this case won't work for you.Also no way to charge it while it is in this case, if you want to zip it up, which would have been convenient.

Replaced the fabric head strap on my Quest 2 and it feels so much more stable and comfortable on my head.  A bit more pricey than some of the aftermarket straps but I like branded stuff and this works great.  While the elite strap with battery would have been even better, I rarely find myself playing for more than about 2 hours at a time so its fine for me to have a nice gaming session then take a break to rest my eyes while it charges and I get something to eat or go out for a walk.  This or other aftermarket straps are a MUST if you are more than a casual gamer.

The only reason this strap is highly rated is because people are comparing it to the default strap which is garbage. One of the sides of my headset snapped randomly when I was putting it on yesterday.

Though at first, It worked perfectly fine, And it felt amazing. About a month in the way to tighten the strap to your head starts to loosen by itself while you are playing and makes the whole experience uncomfortable. I have not been able to use the headset with this strap without it almost falling off. Honestly, the whole thing looks and feels cheaply made for a 50$ price tag. id suggest this thing is worth about 10 or 20. not to mention some other people (NOT ME) have had their straps snap, rendering them totally useless.

When I bought my Oculus Quest 2, I got a package that included a link to PC cable, the same cable you can find on Amazon for less than $20. It wouldn't stay constantly connected to the PC and would disconnect at the worst times (like landing on XP11). I decided to get this official Oculus Link cable and it hasn't disconnected a single time, and the graphics quality seems to be more stable than just using Air Link, plus it let's the headset stay charged when doing longer flights, whereas AirLink only lasts about 1½ hours.

After using this strap, I will never be able to use the strap that comes with the stock Oculus Quest 2 again!So, so, so much more comfortable and it helps balance the weight of the whole unit on your head.If you're going to play your Oculus for more than a few minutes, you really should pick this up this strap upgrade. You won't regret it.My only complaint is that Facebook gave me that garbage strap with my Quest when I bought it in the first place.

It is absolutely ridiculous that for a $300+ purchase, the original headband is restrictive and painful and you have to spend an additional $50 for a comfortable headband. For the price of the Oculus, the headband should not have to be replaced just so that wearing it can be tolerable. The kid wasn't playing much with the original because it hurt his head too much regardless of adjustments being made. However, once we bought this and put it on, he has begun using the Oculus again.

It's pretty obvious to anybody who spends more than 2 seconds looking at this that $80 is definitely overpriced. Many reviews state as much.However, this being said, it is absolutely a fantastic cable for what it is. Everything about its construction is fantastic, and it's easily the best C to C cable I've ever had. If it was in the $40-50 wheelhouse, it'd still be on the pricey end, but I could easily justify its cost for the quality to anyone.As is though, you'd be better off looking around. Other C to C cables can easily be used for the Link, and you can find some good 10ft+ ones for a quarter of the price of this. Only spring for this if you're wearing through cables quickly, or you really need the full 16 feet (most people won't).

I own both the Quest and Quest 2 and I have to say this is the best of the straps.The first Quest strap was pretty good but just needed a counter weight and to cup the back of the head better. I’m a female so maybe a smaller head was the issue.  Anyway, it worked right out of the box with little issues that could be fixed. But the Quest 2 elastic strap is just painful.  The two plastic pieces bother my head after awhile and it wasn’t very secure moving around.  I have long hair and it didn’t stay at all.  I used the VR Power battery from Rebuff Reality to try and stabilize it but it didn’t help.  And the Studioform VR strap wasn’t going to work at all with no structure to hang on to.This Quest 2 elite strap is very comfortable.  It cups the back of my head nicely for a secure fit.  This helps with the weight distribution.  But I still added the VR Power battery pack to it for more balance.  It’s a must buy. Or you’ll have to wait to FrankenQuest it. For me this is the cheaper buy and  it’s very comfortable.

The original strap is good if you plan to use your vr for mild things and or play for less than 1hr but keep on using your vr for longer than that and you get a head ache that starts at the front of your forehead because of all the pressure you apply with the original strap.This item aliviates that issue as it places some of that pressure towards the back of your head and it makes the over all fit more snug.Definitely recommend if you plan to game on the vr or if you are afraid of the vr flying off your head.

I love the design of the strap, compared with the one that comes with the Quest 2. It worked great for a while.Unfortunately, after a bit over three months and treating it carefully, avoiding adding too much pressure on it broke. I was not even using it when it happened. I just grabbed the headset to use it (always from the middle band), and it broke in my hand.Was this a bad batch? A design flaw? A poor choice of material? Not enough testing in QA? A combination of all?Maybe it was bad luck; who knows.The idea behind the design is great, and I truly like it. I mean, if it wasn’t for that, it feels comfortable using. I never pushed it because I heard lots of stories like mine after I ordered.I’ve been using the fabric strap that came with the Oculus, and I have to say it is surprisingly good, and even if it looks more durable than the “elite” version, although it doesn't fit as well as the ""elite"".UPDATE:I contacted Oculus Support, and they offered either a refund or a replacement. As I bought it through Amazon, the refund must be handled by Amazon; but as I like the strap design, I requested a replacement. They emailed me a UPS tag to return the broken strap (so make sure to keep it if you one to go this route and its original box). A few days after, I received confirmation that a new elite strap was sent at no cost, so I want to express thanks to Oculus Support for taking care of this problem.

While it’s fairly comfortable, it has to be pretty tight or it moves around on your head which makes games blurry. I really hoped this would relieve some more of the pressure from my cheeks and distribute the weight better throughout my head.  Far too overpriced for what it is.

It took me a second to figure out how to place the controllers but I figured it out eventually.  The only thing I would add is a pocket on the top of the case. That would be cool to put loose items such as the the power cord and extra batteries so it doesn’t move around and possibly damaging the vr.

My boyfriend and I both have an oculus (his on the left, mine on the right). He got his before mine and bought an elite strap to go with it and suggested I do the same. I’ve had this elite strap for almost a year now and haven’t realized we had a different brand this whole time. My boyfriend’s unofficial oculus strap is 1000% better than what the oculus store is offering and $15.00 cheaper. This official oculus strap is very uncomfortable with a silicone/rubber padding and leaves all the weight of the oculus hanging on your face. My head is left sore and cramped early on and my playtime is therefore limited. I also find the muscles in my face start quivering after trying to hold the oculus up without any real support. My boyfriend’s strap on the other hand is padded with extra support in the back to balance the weight of the device. I wish I could get a full refund for this item but the return window has unfortunately closed.

While I love the Head Strap, it is not very durable.  My strap, or the band whatever you want to call it has broken in several places, I find it extremely brittle.  I have had mine since Oct 13, 2020 and it has already broken.  What I find even more troubling is that while I am still within the Amazon return window, they don't have any in stock for a replacement.  Because of that I have used some superglue and some 3D printed parts to use to try to keep it together.  I really do like the band and would give it 5 stars except for the durability.

If you have a quest 2, or are thinking about buying one, so yourself a huge favor and replace the included head strap. I used the included one for a while thinking that I didn't need to spend the extra money on the elite strap... When I couldn't take the discomfort anymore and finally bought this strap, I wished that I had just bought it right away and avoided all the pain. It is seriously worth the money. I also zip-tied a battery pack to the back and the counterweight takes all of the pressure off of my face. Game changer for the Quest 2!

I don't understand how this doesn't come standard with the Oculus Quest 2. I had gone for 2 months convincing myself that I didn't need this strap, but then I noticed what YouTubers were saying- the default strap caused the headset to gradually slide down my face over a session of using it. The elite strap keeps the headset snug in place on my face, and it's a must own for any daily user of the Quest 2, particularly those who use it for working out.

I find this very comfortable and easier to put on than the cloth strap. The only other VR headset I have experience with, was the Rift S that had a halo style headband but the same rigid circle ratchet on the back. I much prefer something like this compared to a fabric.I thought the back part was padded, I was wrong there is no padding. I still find it comfortable, but I also have a counterweight so your mileage may vary.This was easy to install, I was scared I was going to break the plastic side pieces but they come off and snap on just fine.

I bought the Elite strap with my Quest 2 upon reviews that read.  I'm new to Oculus and never used the original straps that come with the Quest 2.  While comfortable, the fitting and comfort is not perfect.  The comfort is great but I don't have experience to compare to.  My concern comes after I purchased the Quest 2 and Elite Strap I started reading other users experiencing their Elite Strap breaking after a short period.

One of the problems I had with the off the shelf straps was neck strain at the back of my neck. This has immediately resolved the uneven weight distribution and actually makes the headset feel a lot more comfortable to wear.With it's well made construction it would obviously jack up the price to say it should be standard, but I wouldn't advise using an Oculus Quest 2 without this.

I had issues with the default strap putting too much pressure on my face, and rubbing against my ears. The elite strap fixed all of these issues. Installation was super easy, and took about 5 min. I did hear about some users struggling with removing and snapping on the strap, so I came into it expecting I'd need to ""snap"" off the old strap.

If the cable was manufactured incorrectly or with faulty materials, that could be one issue. It seemed to work at first, but it stops working after about 5 minutes sometimes. The third party HDMI cable I have for the phone is much more efficient, sturdy, and reliable. The error could be internal or with the Verizon phone or with Windows.  Rather than place blame, I'd rather find the solution.

I purchased this upgrade as part of a bundle after reading that. If you’re going to buy…or even already have the Quest 2 without this upgraded Elite Strap (more than just a strap really)….do yourself a huge favor and GET IT !!! You won’t be disappointed!It dials in to a perfect fit with every sized head….it also made a difference with potential fatigue. Keeps the headset from moving around while you’re active….and it just feels more comfortable

Update 4 months later: it is still really comfortable, but we now have 4 cracks in it from just handling it. The plastic is super brittle. I have duct tape around several parts to keep it in place. It is rather expensive to be so flimsy.Original review: Honestly worth the money. It fits all the heads in my house (from really big to really small). Perhaps some of the cheaper options are good, but I am glad we just decided to get this one.

Got this in the bundle with my Quest 2, so I'd assume since it's gonna be worth the $79 I paid for it. Instead, I got a faulty wire. Doesn't charge my headset while connected to my pc. Worse than that, it regularly and spontaneously disconnects the Oculus Link even though the cable is firmly plugged in to both my computer and my Quest 2. Strangely this wasn't a problem until recently (No, I didn't step on the wire or pull it or anything). No clue what's going on with this, but it's not worth $79.

Most everyone agrees you need a better strap on the Quest 2 than what comes in the box.  I first ordered a third party head strap that was $10 cheaper, but couldn't get it to click onto the Quest.  This one was back in stock and I haven't regretted it at all.  It fits the Quest perfectly and is extremely comfortable.  I can finally get a tight fit so that the screen doesn't go blurry because the headset moved on my head.

I caved in and bought this cable after the anker one I bought was defective upon arrival. And like the title said, it worked great and never gave me an issue. Until yesterday while I was playing Pavlov on my quest 2 and I accidentally had the cable get caught on my arm and tugged on it while turning a corner in the game. Surely an $80 cable should be designed to withstand being tugged one at least a couple times. I can’t believe that at the price you pay for this cable you get a cheap plastic non-reinforced housing for the connectors.

I knew this was a common complaint but bought it anyway because the Q2 default strap was just so bad compared to the Q1. Only getting two months out of it was still a disappointment. Otherwise a good headset strap, but too expensive to buy as a disposable over and over. This was with me treating it carefully bit perhaps wearing it on the tighter side (which the dial enables)Edit: Second one broke after a year of being careful not to over-tighten or lift from the back. Also during the colder months so that's probably a thing with the cheap plastic. Superglue doesn't help. Gonna try some other straps now that there's more options.

This might be the best upgrade you can make to the Oculus Quest 2.  It makes switching between users very convenient.  More importantly, it actually keeps the Oculus in place during more physically demanding games and apps.  It does little to improve the comfort of the Oculus pressing against your forehead - so don’t expect that design flaw to be solved with this accessory.

I'd been using the strap that comes with the unit and didn't even realize there were accessories available until I watched a YouTube video. This is definitely worth it. It's makes for a more adjustable and comfortable fit. There's a wheel in the back you turn to adjust the snugness of the fit and you can get it 'just right'.The strap that comes with the Oculus isn't horrible, but this is definitely a worthwhile upgrade.

Oculus should likely include this as the default rather than the elastic strap that comes instead.  The elastic strap required so much pressure to keep the headset in the right position on my face that it caused pain after just a few minutes use.  After replacing the elastic which this, wearing the headset seems almost effortless.  The weight of the headset is carried on the top of the wearer's head rather than the face.  In addition, the rear-head support comfortably balances the headset to prevent it from sliding down the wearer's face during most movement.  As a result, the headset only requires moderate pressure to keep in place with this strap installed.Installation was a piece of cake as well.  No tools required.

so, i wear glasses, and was told by oc\fb to buy this headstrap in order to combat this. this did not help, it bent the hell out of my glasses, gives me neck pain the day after im done using it, and can also caise headaches. the elite strap does not compare to the original q1 strap which had a tilt on the backing to help distribute weight, this does not. IMO, both the base strap and this one are equally bad but for different reasons. Also these only cost FB 10 bucks to make, so why is this 50? it will work for some but not for everyone, also the craftsmanship is shotty at best, Get the franken one for best comfort and stability, or just 3d print this one for way cheaper if u think it will work for you.

I mostly play flight-sims and seated games and this is a major negative as it completely breaks immersion every time it scrapes against the headrest.

When u plug this into your headset, your battery will go down about 10% even if you've been charging this thing for 2 days straight. It will say you have extended battery life but I just dont see it. The strap itself though is very comfortable and does seem necessary next to the one that comes with the headset. That one is trash. Your best best is too just plug your headset in with a long cable so u can move around or buy a backup battery bank and velcro it to the top of your headset.

You might as well just get a router and a cable for the same price. Less hassle, and might even just be less expensive.The main issue with this is that it is expensive and keeps disconnecting, it is REALLY easy to disconnect this on accident. Not to mention, it's a cable. I really recommend going wireless, I got the ASUS rt-ax55 and it works just fine for me.

Didn’t use very durable strong material I treat my stuff with ALOT of care and noticed that it had broken when I went to use it. It also has a stand on my desk away from everything else not just thrown around. Disappointed should have listened to the reviews sounds like vibe is better for the price. But as of right now their customer service bot says they will contact me and send me a new one. Hopefully they eventually make these straps more durable in the future.

When I put this on the Oculus Quest 2, the additional battery weight was very noticeable, but it is worth the trade off of not having to go through re-adjusting the Velcro each time my kid and wife want to use it. So far, the extended battery life will let my kid play for hours on it.

The strap is very convenient compared the built in one. It ratchets to your head for a nice tight fit, and it has great support.However, after a month of daily use, the side started to crack. I placed a little gorilla Twitter on the inside to help support it, but now after 3 months of use, it has fully cracked. Not the worth the money for how long it lasted

I would take this on a trip unless packed in a bag wrapped by a blanket.  3rd party cases are just too bulky or for some stupid reason neglect to accommodate the bigger strap most of us use on our Oculus 2.

The Quest 2 carrying case is a nice way to store your Quest 2 when you’re not using it, and a great way to transport it without having to worry about damaging the device. While it is similar to the Quest 1 case, the major difference here is that the zipper is hidden, and the inside is built specifically to hold the Quest 2 controllers and accessories. It’s a great case, and well worth the asking price.

The Quest 2 will fit with the strap in the box.Cons$50 might be a little pricey, but it was the only option on launch and it is a must have until 3rd party options become availableOther notesThe installation wasn't as bad as others might say it is. However prying the original cloth strap off was a little nerve wrenching, since I didn't want to hurt my new headset.

The strap that comes with the Quest 2 is pretty sub-par.  It makes the headset hard to take off and on, hard to get adjusted properly,  uncomfortable to wear and conducive to neck strain.

It was great compared to the provided strap, much more comfortable. But after less than 50 hours of very mild use, like many others have experienced it developed a crack. The plastic is very cheap feeling, and after getting hands on, nowhere near the $50 price tag, maybe $25 at most. I am currently working with oculus support to receive a replacement, and hoping the have truly fixed the issue. The crack fully split when removing to find date code requested by support.

I liked using this strap because it was far more comfortable than the one the Quest 2 shipped with. I also liked how easy it was to adjust it. For these reasons, it's a solid strap and why I gave it 2 stars instead of one. HOWEVER, the quality of the strap is quite poor and it breaks easily. Mine broke today after very light use.Until Oculus can improve the quality of this strap or lower the price, I highly recommend going with something else. You can probably find a similarly styled strap for far less money on here. This strap just feels like a scam.

I had to come back and re write my original review.The pictures above show regular wear use has still caused the strap to break. This is 3 months of use at maybe 3-4 times per week.

When the strap appeared back on the market, I assumed the problem had been solved and placed an order.The strap really is an upgrade from the basic strap included with the Quest 2. Not ideal, but many times better. I would give it 4 or 5 stars except for the fact that after two months of use, it abruptly snapped for no apparent reason.It's possible I received a first run strap and not a newer, better one.

I've been using this strap off and on for the past few months whenever I would use my Quest 2, and I thought that they had fixed the issue where they would break, but the headstrap finally broke this afternoon. Thankfully I thought to hang on to the strap that ships with the Quest 2, but it's still annoying that it broke after less than 100 hours of use, probably even less than 60 now that I think about it. Upon further inspection I found cracks that were beginning to form on the other side of the strap.For context I was using the Logitech G Pro headset (which is one of the approved accessories by FB, not that it matters) as well as a third party link cable when it snapped. the headstrap itself was comfortable while it lasted, but I would look elsewhere if you want a longer-term solution.

I knew when I ordered this in January 2021 that there had been many reports of the strap cracking, but I was under the impression that this problem had been addressed. Nevertheless, almost exactly six months after careful use, mine cracked in exactly the same way as had been reported elsewhere. Fortunately, Facebook/Oculus replaced it for free, but I had to ship it back before receiving a replacement so I was without a strap for a couple of weeks (and I ordered a different make/model to replace it). It was good while it lasted, but I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone else.

It looks cool and feels cool but if you add an accessory headset that isn’t oculus it’s quite a tight fit. My zipper seems a little janky around the last turn closing, hasn’t broken but, not so smooth. It’s really a nice looking case , just needs to be bigger.

When I first bought this, I thought why did I get it? I purchased it as a package deal, but once I switched, I loved it. It is a lot more comfortable than the band that the oculus comes with and feels more secure. It also helps with keeping pressure off of your face and evenly distributing it throughout the entire head to not strain one spot to fast.

Alr starting offThe head strap is great... Once you get used to it. I've been using the normal quest 2 strap for a few months and finally got a new head strap! It wasn't so comfortable at first though.. It took a few weeks and finally got used to it. I love it but it broke too early. I'm pretty sure oculus has fixed this and they gave me a replace!Conclusion: It's a great head strap, but the shape of your head also depends on what head strap will be comfortable for you. I love it but I'll probably look for other options!

First, this type (back head support) strap should be standard equipment. There are much better straps out there, the battery while it is a benefit makes the unit a lot heavier and hotter. I'm not returning it but I'm also not using it.  Waste of money as far as I'm concerned.  It was replaced with a $25 model that works great.

Honestly, the product itself has been great. It's not the most comfortable thing in the world, but it certainly beats the elastic straps that come with the quest 2. I've only had this for 40 days or so, and the plastic just gave out. I keep my quest stored in a case designed specifically for this product and the quest 2 when not in use. I've got maybe 50 hours (I'm being generous with my guess) of playtime. I pulled it out of the case, popped it on my head, tightened the head band and snap. And it's just past the 30 day return period. Great design if you want to sell lots of them.

1st I'll start with saying this headset is the most comfortable I've tried, which just makes the situation so unfortunate. Bought 2 for both our headsets and unfortunately both of them cracked/broke soon after we installed them. After the 1st one broke we were extra careful with the remaining 1 and after taking it off we went to plug it in and it twisted just slightly and we heard the crack. TOTAL BUMMER. Its really such a disappointment that they don't have a reinforcement on the sides like the other straps do.

This case, while an eccentric design, is perfect for taking your VR wherever you go. It fits the charger plug, charging cable, headset, and both controllers perfectly. Most importantly, when it’s shut the items don’t fall out of place, stay very secure, and won’t get hurt if it suffers a fall.Would highly recommend!

While this product is good in theory, the quality of the materials is less than what I would call good. Less than 2 weeks into use, one side of the connector to the quest headset snapped off. Tried to contact Facebook to process the warranty, and kept being put in a cycle of send us info, and we'll send you a new one.Well. I gave up after the first few months (sent the requested information 3 separate times)So, if you are lucky enough to get one without a material defect it is more comfortable than the base heads trap and does fit more securely.Otherwise, it is completely useless.

If they replace my strap quickly and the new one is of better quality, I will update my review.*Update* - While my second strap lasted longer than the first, it has now failed at about 6 months of use.

When I first received and started using the elite strap I was very impressed with how light, balanced, and comfortable it was. About 4 weeks into use I started noticing the tightening knob ""slipping"" every now and then but didn't think much of it. However, over the next couple weeks the slipping was happening more and more frequently and I started to notice the back head-strap portion was very off center and the strap would not sit properly on my head. I looked up solutions online and they worked as far as straightening the head-strap back to normal, but now the slipping happens almost immediately when i begin tightening the strap and I can no longer tighten it enough to fit properly.

When I first received my elite strap for the Oculus Quest 2  I was very excited.  It was extremely comfortable and fit well.  Unfortunately, that feeling didn't last long.  Within 2 weeks of use the plastic arm that connect to the headset snapped.  I glued it and retried.  Snapped again. It didn't break in the same spot. It broke about 3/4 of an inch down.  Again, glued and retried.  Once again it snapped further down.  I give up. I am very disappointed in the quality of this ""elite"" strap.

I bought this product with my headset, and it worked well for the first month or two until I tripped while playing a game, and the USB-C connection sheered clean off of the connection port on my computer. Given the high expense, and the complete lack of warranty options for this product, I would recommend that any buyers seek a cheaper alternative. If it can break due to a simple misstep and cost 80 dollars with no recourse, any benefits it may or may not provide the cheaper variants are not worth the risk. I plan on ordering a third party replacement that costs less than half the expense of this cord.

It broke in the middle of me using it and good thing I was able to catch my quest 2 because that would have been more expensive to replace.

Fantastic fit, works exactly as advertised. For about a week. The first crack developed in a few days, despite not being work very tight (or too loose,) and followed by another crack and eventually the weight of the Oculus Quest 2 snapped it. Perhaps this one was particularly brittle or something, but this was a terrible outcome for such a useful and otherwise well-designed item. I'll try again, but be cautious and wear it gently unless you like replacing purchases.

Bought in March.  Worked fairly well, very comfortable, I was more or less happy with it until a few days ago when it snapped.  I only use the Quest every couple weeks, so I don't know how long that translates into use hours.  Certainly not enough for the cost.  I figure I'll try to epoxy it, but being a stress break I doubt it will hold for long.  Too expensive for this kind of defect, given how many other users have the same issue.

I bought the Quest 2 Elite strap for $50.00 thinking it was a quality item, boy was I wrong. I saw in the reviews that a lot of people were experiencing the plastic strap cracking and breaking, but assumed they were just being too rough with it. Needless to say, after gently using the strap a few times, it cracked and broke. Since it’s over the 30 day return window, I guess I’m stuck with a $50.00 paperweight. The strap that came with the Quest 2 may not be as comfortable, but it least it lasts longer.

This strap did a great job of holding the Oculus more securely and comfortably than the original strap.  But one of the side straps snapped the other day when I reached to pick it up.  I'm a very light Oculus user - maybe 1-2 hours a week, and I've only had this about 6 weeks.  It has never been dropped, banged, or been subjected to any stress other than normal wear.  The hard plastic side straps are either too thin or just a bad material to use for that application.  Very disappointing that something that cost $50 broke after less than 12 hours of normal use.

Item is okay and seems to hold the Quest 2 well. My only complaint is that the case could be a little harder for protection and the zipper is awful! It is hard to zip up and the zipper is difficult to hold on to while zipping (zipper is weird/too thin). Overpriced.

I thought they fixed the breaking problem but I guess not. I purchased the improved, problem fixed version of the elite strap and it broke the same as all the others. It's suppose to have a 2 year warranty but must not be allowed through Amazon because it won't let me return it. I wonder how difficult and how long it will take trying to have it replaced through Oculus. Disappointing.

This case, as you might assume, is the ideal Quest 2 case, period. It doesn't have a whole lot of space reserved for accessories or any additional things you may want to carry with it, but it's got a little, like *maybe* enough for a counterweight/battery, but I have not tested this. Regardless, it fits the headset, the controllers, the charger, and it will fit it with the glasses spacer, too. It is well designed and hides the zipper in a beautiful way.

I thought it would be a lot thicker and more of a hard shell but it’s not.  For my use which is around the house and storing it away when I’m not using it seems to work perfectly. But if you plan on taking it around the globe when traveling or to grandmas house I’m confident it would be broken within a couple drops. So just be aware of traveling with it but for use at home it’s perfect.

This head strap is great until it isn't.  I'm not the first nor will I be the last to have this snap from normal use.  The plastic is cheap and will eventually break.  I have had this since the end of January (today is March 3) and it broke today.  The return date was February 25th.  I would look to find a third party head strap.  It is too bad because before it snapped it provided a great fit.  Occulus needs to stand by their product and offer replacements/refunds for this cheap plastic.

If you want to play the Quest 2 with PCVR games on steam VR then this is a must have. Don't buy the knock off brands. If you just want a cord for charging while playing the Quest 2 portably then buy off brand as you don't need the connectivity speed for quality PCVR games.

Its flawed in its materials and craftsmanship and should be recalled entirely. They break from basic use, or rather no use at all. having it connecting causes stress on the plastics, the plastic is rigid and becomes brittle and snaps. I've glued mine back together  about 5 places, every time i glue one spot it splits in another. I did  not have heavy usage i simply kept it connected to my quest and in a chest. I came back after about 2 months of no use and found it snapped.

Compared to some other cases that you could buy, this case doesn’t allow your oculus to move around, which protects it even more. However, if you buy a different head strap other than the oculus provided strap or the other headstrap from oculus, it MAY not fit in the case.

The Strap works well.  But, it broke after 5 months.  And I handled the strap carefully due to others reporting similar issue with it breaking.  Oculus needs to look into improving the design or using better plastic material to insure that the strap can last for at least a year.  The price is pretty expensive for a known problematic strap.  However, as I do like the strap, I did buy a new one and hope it will last longer that 5 months.

The screws in the back fell out and the strap snapped just from regular use and carrying it, I knew it had a possibility of it breaking so I took really good care of it but it still broke, and the problems weren’t even easy to fix, I tried tape and superglue, I even tried to screw the screws back in but nothing worked for too long

It is super comfortable and way better than the strap the headset comes with but it cracked and broke in half within a month of normal use. Oculus was kind enough to send me a new one but still, breaking within one month is super bad, especially for 50 dollars.

High quality connectors and molding, the cable itself is supposed to be fiber optic cable - with USB C connectors, thick, flexible.On the other hand - any day now - Oculus should release their ""Air Link"" solution, so check that first before buying the cable.(I bought the cable before ""Air Link"" was a thing...)

Awesome strap the only thing that bugs is that this is a need you have to have when having the oculus because the regular strap is really uncomfortable. But this one feels really great. The only down side is having to purchase the system itself then this. I think for the cost of the oculus it should come together and the price should stay the same for the quest.

I've been using the quest for a few weeks now and this headstrap is way better then the stock one. Even after long times using the headset, it doesnt feel stressfull on the back of my head or my face. The only thing i've noticed is I sweat a little more because its tighter on my face but thats usual.

This item is very good. Before I bought this item my Oculas Quest 2 Headband strap was trash and I had a better time using it while having my hand on the VR the whole time but then I bought this because my friend told me about it and it is the best item i’ve bought in a long time. 5/5 stars.

Funciona perfectamente hasta el momento ningún problema con que se vaya a romper o algo así, el único problema es que cuando la ajustas demasiado la parte de atrás tiende a irse hacia la izquierda. Para solucionarlo desajusta hasta el límite y sigue desajustando hasta que llegue a su posición

Después de dos semanas de uso ligero, menos de una hora al día. Quede sorprendido de ver trisaduras en uno de los brasos. Nunca lo forcé. (2020)Pensando que fue una mala tanda, compré oto nuevo a principios del 2021. Me duro 4 meses hasta que aparecieron las trizaduras nuevamente. Es un problema de diseño. No lo compren!
