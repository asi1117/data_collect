Long time vive user, sold my vive and decided to try the rift, this is visually way better in my opinion (less screen door), I also prefer the controllers, much more natural and it feels like a new experience all together, oculus VR software once your in is pretty sweet, weight of headset is nice and light, doesn't feel clunky like the vive, integrated headphones a bonus. Once you get it going it's nice...but.... be prepared to be frustrated. This thing takes hours to get going and the initial setup software I find to be very unstable. Be prepared to spend extra on good usb 3.0 extension  cables, a good usb 3.0 controlller,  extra sensors... It's not an out of the box room scale experience like the vive which you can have up and running quickly. In the end it costs more than the basic vive with all the the stuff you need (if you don't have all the ports etc). Tracking with 2 sensors is nowhere near 360 room scale like the vive. Vive wins in ease of setup and initial tracking. Waiting to see how good 3 sensors will be. I'm still definitely happy with my purchase but would have rated at higher if it was an out-of-the-box 360 room scale vr experience and easy to set up. If you're getting this for someone for Christmas make sure you set it up a week before and get it running.

I have seen the future and it is amazing! Not specifically this product. VR in general. Though this headset is great. It's easy to wear and simple to use, and surprisingly easy to set up. Get it when it is on sale though, don't pay full price. This is an early-ish gen product and I wouldn't spend so much if it weren't for it was on sale and had come down a lot since I last looked. Ignore the Vive unless that is on sale too. But new versions of both headsets are probably coming out soon so depending on when you are looking make sure you aren't going to buy just before it gets outdated. But still, this is really fun! It's great exercise, gets me moving compared to sitting and twiddling my thumbs with my XBox. And the immersion is just so much greater than anything I've ever experienced before. that is until some of the less comfortable games make me barf. That is a genuine issue until you get used to VR. But you can stick to more comfortable games first and work upwards.Warning! If you wear glasses check to make sure they fit (goes for any headset really), mine don't fit so I'm going to get a cheap new pair or some lenses and 3D print a mount to hold them in my Rift. Anything less than 12mm (or there abouts, please check Oculus faqs) should fit.Oh, fair warning, since you may be plugging and unplugging this from our GPU often get a short adapter if you haven't already gotten an extension cable (two, one HDMI, one usb 3.0). This is especially true for some Asus cards like mine. The pins on the rift's HDMI connector are pretty tight and pushed the loose pins on the gpu's port inwards to where they don't work anymore. MY card is fine except for an HDMI port. Now I have to use an adapter, and I consider it Asus' fault for making a flimsy HDMI port. But regardless, use an adapter so that will get damaged instead of your GPU.But seriously, check if  new headset from any of the manufacturer's are coming out soon. THis is still an early gen product and even if the next gen is completely the same but without the cable (as Oculus hints it will be), it'll be 100 times more worth it. The cable is tolerable but annoying and I'd pay to get rid of it. More peripheral vision would be nice too.

This is a keeper. I know they will reduce the price and the cameras will get better. But this is still a keeper. Firstly, the free applications are in the Oculus store and you get it after you register. Secondly, take your time to set up a good sized play area ( more than 6 x 6 ft): worth. Once you put the visor on, you are immersed in an alternate reality. Your eyes tell you your brain that you've moved to another world but your ears will still hear the door bell. You might get tired of the exercise, make sure you've got access to a chair.Yes you can watch movies: try an IMAX movie or one which fills the entire 180 or 360 area around you. This will take you close to the  IMAX experience.Bear in mind, the camera resolution is not the best. I understand that the Vive is better. But your brain will fill in the gaps and you will hardly notice it unless you are looking. But this is partly the limitation of the medium rather than the Oculus cameras. Once the price comes down OR this becomes a must have, the cameras are going to get better and the rendering resolution is going to improve.The material is very well made for a Chinese product. The cables could have been braided instead of the plain plastic sheathing.The visor is very comfortable and I had none of the barn door effects that the others have. I tried with and without glasses and both were surprisingly comfortable.I am going to try actual videos/photos from my own astro and underwater collection. Plus videos from others (like the ISS, ESA and Woods Hole Oceanographic). Imagine swimming with a blue whale in your den.Anyone for tennis, hoops or chess? And...while we're on two person sports....

Bought a new Asus ROG gl702vi laptop with a GTX 1080. Installation was simple. Unit worked for about 5 minutes then the display shut off. Audio still worked. Simple research online results in so many possible issues it could be. Could never get the display to come on for more than a few seconds. After dozens of attempted solutions, either the unit is defective or there's an issue with the laptop. Could be a bandwith issue with the USB 3.0 ports. Returned for a full refund and bought an HTC Vive that has never had an issue. A cousin recently purchased an Oculus Rift and it works fine for him.While there are many VR solutions out there at the moment, the best choice really comes down to an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. The best choice would be a Vive Pro if you have the money but we'll ignore it for this review. The main differences between the 2 are price, controllers, sensors, connections, and scale.Rift requires multiple USB ports with many being USB 3.0. The cameras are connected to your computer so room scale setup is difficult. You need 3 USB ports and an HDMI port available. The Touch controllers are much nicer. A third camera is recommended for room scale (plus USB extension cable) and that brings the price up to the Vive level. Room scale is smaller than the Vive 1.0 sensors.Vive has wireless sensors instead of cameras that you can mount on the walls. Only an HDMI and USB cable connect to your computer. Room scale setup is a breeze. The Wand controllers are not as nice to use and feel large and clunky. The upcoming Knuckles controllers look better. Deluxe audio strap is almost required and costs extra. Room scale is larger with 1.0 sensors and almost double that with 2.0 sensors (may need the Vive Pro for 2.0?).

Shipping was fast but it was through Puroilator who are extremely rough on packages and their mail outlet is in the slummiest part of my city and the store doubles as a cellphone repair store. The entire pickup process was incredibly scary looking when 90% of the store is tailored to cellphone and laptop repair. They kept my $3,000 pc sitting on the floor on the consumer side of the counter right next to the door to leave the store. I literally took the day off work and sat in a chair at the entrance to my apartment for 5 and a half hours waiting for them because I didn't want to to both wait 24 hours to pick up, and have to go to their scary mail depo to get my riftAnyways on to the product, The Rift came sealed and in seemingly new looking condition but upon inspecting the lenses, there are very noticeable glue smudges under the lens from poor construction. I did some research and other amazon buyers have had this problem, only to return it several times for a replacement that also ends up having some lense smudges but in different places. It looks like everyone us just giving up and accepting their damaged lenses instead of the headache of sending things back and forth with replacements. Compared my lenses to my friends and his are completely clear no smudges under the lens. The smudges make my peripherals very blurry at all times.. The main point of VR is visual so if you can't see things properly, it's worthless.

The product had a film or residue on the lens so it went back to Oculus support under warranty which sent me a replacement refurbished unit.  This unit was in far worse condition then what I sent away as its lenses were scratched up.  This happened 2 more times.  That is correct 3 refurbished units sent my way all with damaged lenses.  Since January I have only had the unit in my possession for roughly 30 days, the remaining 60+ it has been in transit or I have been waiting for them to send replacements.  I am completely dissatisfied with the customer service I have received as they are now claiming the scratched lenses on the refurbished units are my own fault.  The only mistake I made was purchasing the unit through AMAZON!  Because I bought it through them I am unable to get a refund on the purchase.  Overall this has been the most negative experience I have had purchasing anything.At this point I will never again purchase an Oculus product and am seriously reconsidering my purchasing habits using AMAZON.

Pros:- amazing tracking- controllers are the best: capacitive touch sensors, feels damn good, has analog sticks- feels good on head, not too heavy- the headphones are just amazing, sounds deceptively good- works great on GTX 1050 TICons:- needs at least 3 to 4 USB ports, 1 of them needs to be USB 3.0- small sweet-spot comparison to Vive. Kinda blurry too- Oculus app is not the best, sometimes crashes too even during setup- setup is flaky, never consistent- guardian setup is absolutely not intuitive- horrible for people with glasses, at least I couldn't wear one at all, just wouldn't fit normal sizeOverall, it's not bad. Obviously these generation of VR headsets are not future proof and pretty much test product until Oculus Quest or something better, mainly because they're not practical (not wireless, need good gaming pc, 3 sensors, etc.)

A lot of people are writing reviews that try and say this VR system is the best thing since sliced bread.Reality check:1. Video is blurry. The ""screen door"" effect makes everything look blurry.2. There is no room for you to wear your glasses, no matter how small they are.3. The lenses are constantly fogging up because4. The lenses are so close that your eyeballs are almost touching them. I can feel them every time I blink,5. Your eye lashes will contact the lenses.6. There are NO instructions included with this $450 device. The only option you have is, immediately upon opening the package, go to their website for all instructions.7. There web site will have link that says ""is this you first time setting up the rift?"", and when you click it, it takes you to another page, and on that page is a link that says something like ""First time users, click here to see our easy setup guide"", which, of course, brings you back to the first page you were on.Here is the best instruction you can get: Download the driver and install it and follow the instructions, ignoring anything on their website.Once installed:The VR effect is pretty good, but in my opinion it doesn't make up for the blurriness overall. You do get a couple of free games and some other software, but after the initial cool factor the novelty wears off pretty quickly.There is a Steam VR game called Overload based off of an old PC game called Descent. It was an excellent game at the time, and the people who developed it are doing Overdrive, but it's unfinished. It has single player and PVP, but that's it. You can't have multiple people in missions (co-op).Many VR games don't support the Oculus controllers, which can be a big disappointment, and some apps only support the Rift Remote Control, which doesn't even come with the rift. How dumb is it to only support a controller that no one has?There is some free educational software that's pretty good, and some space walk software, and ISS software that's also free, but the good stuff costs bucks.There is software that will let the Rift work with games that don't support it, but it only gives you a 3D view, not VR, and makes them look like you're playing them on a huge monitor.I'm a huge Star Trek online player, and they don't support the Rift at all. In fact, from what I hear, it used to work in 3D and then the devs did something to prevent the rift from working. Some games work very will in the 3D mode (like Diablo 3).I'm not going to return this because it's not bad and I'm hoping they are going to finish Overdrive, but it's no where near the awesome experience some people make it out to be.EditDon't get ripped off. You can get this same set at Best Buy for $469 Canadian last time I looked. That's the same price I paid for it when Amazon had it in stock. The Rift is not worth $1000. You're better off to go with something else rather than be overcharged by $500.If you don't need PC compatibility, I recommend getting the Oculus Go. It's actually better than the Rift, it's under $300 for the 32GB version, but it's stand-alone Android. It will not work for playing your PC games.

Pros:-Comes with free games-Excellent packaging-The two sensors work well for 360 tracking. Followed a Youtube tutorial on 2 sensor room tracking.-  Many free and inexpensive VR games on Steam. Works with Steam VR.-Many more fun applications than simply gaming.-Climby and SuperHot VR are a legitimate workout - I’m actually grabbing velcro resistance weights to make it even more legit.- Runs most games at full frames well with only a 1050ti and 6600K (more about this in cons)Now onto the headset itself:Pros:-Amazing build quality-Easy set up-Lightweight-PPD slider for different eye pupil distances!-Extremely immersive, with very little lightbleed.Cons:You’ll need a better rig. I’m actually building a new PC so it’s not an issue, but The Forest VR will make you nauseous as it’s not going to hit optimum framerate.-Screendoor effect - Though it is far less noticeable in some games. Anything that has writing seems to be blurry and low res. With this being said, this is Oculus’ first consumer implementation of VR and I’m excited to see what’s next.-Visible condensation on the inside of the mask when playing a session of superhot.Final thoughts: I wish that Oculus had a mounting system like in the Windows Mixed Reality and PSVR headsets that simply flip down.VR is incredible and has rekindled my joy of technology and gaming!

I'd only used the HTC Vive prior to making the purchase. Really it was the cost difference and a few write-ups on performance that made the decision for me.I bought a third sensor and it definitely makes a difference so assume you'll have to do that but the experience-to-price ratio is awesome and I'm very happy with the purchase. Read up on the HTC however and make sure your'e making the choice that's right for you.  They both have their pros-and-cons and it's worth the research.

This is an awesome VR headset. You will need a proper PC to run it tho. I have a 1070ti and a Ryzen 2600 and it’s perfect. I have solid 90fps.I tried this and the HTC Vive and for the price, you can’t beat the Oculus. While the HTC Vive has slighty better tracking, the Oculus is just as good if you get a 3rd sensor. Also, the Oculus controllers are just natural and amazing. Years ahead of the HTC Vive controllers. The oculus is also lighter, so it’s more comfortable for long periods of time.While the Oculus cable is a little short, it’s managable. You can always extend it with an Hdmi extension and Usb 3 extension.So if you want to get into VR, this is the best deal. It also comes with a bunch of cool games.

I’ve used this for about a month now, everything came in a very nice box that can be repurposed for storage or transport. Came in 2 boxes + the box for the unit itself so there was zero damage to rifts box. Set up was fairly easy and quick maybe 20 minutes till i was downloading my first game.I’ve tried it on my gtx 970 and gtx 1080ti. The 970 for me didn’t give me a good experience it didn’t have enough power for everything to be smooth like the 1080ti is butter smooth. It fits snuggly and tight to your face (without glasses) and is comfortable to wear for a few hours at a time or till your tired and need to take a break. Some cons would be the “god rays” noticed them mostly on dark backgrounds and bright words or pictures. And the “barn door effect” it’s there but not overly noticeable unless you look for it. Some thing make it more visible then others like a white loading screen but when playing games I don’t notice it at all.I would definitely buy this again without a doubt just make sure you have a decent graphics card I’d recommend a 1060 or better and a play area where you can take a step in every direction from the center plus a bit of room it move your arms should you end up there I know I’ve hit my desk a few time going threw there guardian barrier without realizing.If you do end up getting one, one thing to remember is you will sweat playing these games standing up so remember hydrate and use the controller safety tether

Had some difficulty finding the ""sweet spot"" at first but after watching a few youtube videos I realized I was wearing the HMD wrong. It is very important to loosen all straps and pull the rear of the HMD down to base of skull and then pivot the front of the HMD down. When looking at screens it almost seems like you are peering about 3/4 of the way up instead of in middle.Only issue I have is with the foam, it does make you sweat more and can be irritating against your skin after a while. I have ordered a replacement from VRCOVERS and looking forward to it. Games are awesome, RoboRecall is what VR is meant to look like and very engaging and fun.Got it when on sale this past summer (last day pulled the pin). Definitely worth it when on sale.

First of all it depends on your pc. I have GTX1060 which is good enough for me. I feel no lag at all playing VR games on the oculus rift. And compared to PS4 VR in case you are choosing between these two like I did, I would say buy Oculus instead. It has better performance than PS4 and higher resolution. PS4 is not bad by any means but Oculus is just better. Also a really important factor is Windows VR is basically an open source platform unlike PlayStation. For games like Beat Saber, you will ONLY be able to add custom mods and songs(which you WILL absolutely want to) if you’re playing a PC version.

Really amazing experience.  Finally there are better games coming out for VR so this is truly worth it.  I've had one die on me already, but Oculus did a warranty replacement on it which was nice.  They even sent an extra set of headphones, facial interface and cable since they don't make you return your originals if they still work during an RMA.  I have 2 of these now in case one goes down, but I'm glad to know the warranty will pull through.

It's pretty cool, but I'm one of the lucky souls who gets motion sickness. Before making a purchase, I recommend giving it a try if you can. For me it only happens on first person games where you walk instead of teleport.I also find a lot of the games are still quite limited to standing and shooting. If you own Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, you automatically can download the VR version for free. So that's nice. Still, I'm hoping to see a lot more extensive content over the next year.I did have an issue with not getting the six free games that are supposed to be bundled with it. I contacted support and had a reply within minutes! After I gave them all the pertinent information, the issue was resolved by the next day. Superb customer support.

VR is legitimately amazing, it really feels like you're in another place. When you sign up with your new Oculus + Touch you also get a couple Oculus Exclusive Games free - hooray. Also didn't realize that it comes with headphones attached already (which i think the base Vive doesn't?)For optimal performance you're going to want a third sensor, though apparently you should be able to operate with two diagonally positioned. Also had to purchase a powered USB hub (tp-link powered USB 3.0 hub) because my new computer couldn't handle the sensors and the headset. so i have two in the hub, one on the front USB and the headset plugged into the back.The touch controllers are really comfortable to use, at first I thought they were awkward but using them they're generally more ergonomic and intuitive to use than the 'egg holder' style of the Vive.

I loved the original headphones that came with my rift, because they are good quality and conveniently built-in.  When my 15yo sister had friends over, they got their hands on my rift, and afterwards the headphones didn’t work.  I figured it was because they pulled wires or were rough with the HMD itself, and nothing I tried fixed the problem.I decided to order these in-ear headphones to see if that would fix it, figuring that I could return them if not, and they work like a charm!  So while, unfortunately, my original headphones don’t work anymore, my rift wasn’t damaged and, as someone who doesn’t usually buy any IEMs for under $100, I can assure anyone looking at these that the quality is as good or better than the headphones that come with the rift, with the same convenience.

It looked amazing and was very comfortable but I had to return it, sadly, because it wasn't compatible with my Alienware 17 laptop (because my graphics card was not connected to the HDMI port).

I got this for DCS World after a friend showed me their setup, and it opened up a whole new world to me. I hadn't played with flight sims in forever because it never felt very immersive -- just staring at a flight, narrow screen, even when the graphics were amazing like in DCS or FSX. But having the ability to look around and actually feeling a bit of vertigo the first time you bank the plane after takeoff is an unreal experience. This is probably as close as you can get to the experience of flying without actually stepping in a plane (or an expensive commercial sim).That said, this version of the Rift still has the grainy ""screen door"" resolution and a relatively narrow peripheral vision. I think the updated version is better. For my money, i'll happily spend this amount annually to get a more and more immersive experience.

The Rift is a great system, it's a value VR option with more bang for the buck with better controllers than the Vive (for now), I was mainly planning to use it for art (Tilt Brush, Medium, Quill, Gravity Sketch), the touch controllers are great for content creation but the headset was too small and the face mask was putting too much pressure on my cheekbones. It's a great system but you'll have to look elsewhere you if you have a larger than average head.

Just beautiful. The display is awesome, I don't notice any SDE and the god rays aren't that bad (but they are there frequently). The touch controllers fit like a glove. The tracking is surprisingly good for room scale with only 2 sensors. 3rd sensor on the way now, because what's another 79$ when the HTC Vive is over twice the price to begin with.ORDER USB 3.0 EXTENSIONS 6-15ft! You can definitely get by without them, but it will make all the difference.The actual headset cables are pretty decent in length.

Having your hands in VR makes an overwhelming difference. It is a bit disappointing that so many games don't use the thumbsticks for movement, making these feel a little too much like a stopgap for true gloves. That said they are incredible comfortable to hold, robust (I have smacked them into my walls full force a few times) and only take a single AA battery each. The cost also makes a little more sense when you consider that all the buttons, triggers and even a few selected blank spots are touch sensitive, giving the illusion that it's tracking your fingers.

This adds so much to the Oculus Rift experience, it really is a must buy for anyone who owns just a Rift HMD. The controllers are very comfortable in the hand, much better than the HTC Vive controllers. I much prefer the design of the 'grip' button over the HTC Vive's as well. They are quite durable as well, having punched my wall with them a number of times (Echo Arena and Gorn) and they did more damage to the wall than the controller.

I had the Samsung gear vr and this is SOOoo much better, the gear only allows for head turning and point/click/aim with remote controller, but the rift supports your actual movements, tracks if you stand or kneel or move around. Much better interactivity and the hand controllers let you do more things like grab thing. Only drawback is that oculus apps for the gear very are not compatible with the oculus rift and you will have to repurchase any apps you had for the gear if you want them on the rift as well.

Got it with a 150$ deal off and seriously, to access at the VR world, it was the best deal. Touch controllers surpass thise of Vive. Setting up the sensors demand a bit more patience then the Vive to obtain the best results. Resolution is better with the Vive Pro obviously, but the price goes with it too.

Other than the HTC Vive that i tried for 20 minutes in a Microsoft store demo, I'm totally new to the VR world of entertainment. So i did my research on the Rift: other users complained about how difficult it was to setup and configure because of their system hardware, while others complained about not being able to get Rift to work at all and how Oculus tech support is completely useless. My system has the MSI 970A Gaming Pro Carbon mobo with 16 GB of RAM and I'm using the AMD R9 290 Video card (3 yrs old at this point!). There's enough USB v3.0 and v2.0 ports to support the Rift requirements. All of the hardware is running at stock speeds, nothing is over-clocked. Installing the Oculus s/w was simple... trying to get the s/w to detect the sensors and headset was a nightmare... I was experiencing the same problems that other users had. My mobo uses the VIA USB eXtensible Host Controller and Oculus says that this is incompatible... i guess they're right! So i bought the StarTech PCI-e superspeed USB 3.0 card... still no luck and after 4 hours of f***ing around with everything I said the hell with it and plugged EVERYTHING into the USB v2.0 ports and Rift works absolutely perfect (go figure) under Win 7 pro and Win 10 pro (i'm dual booting). I don't know why they say to use USB v3 because the sensors seem to work perfect and fast enough... i haven't experienced any lag or slowness under USB v2.0! Getting the sensors placed right took some time but eventually got it! I am totally and completely blown away by the Rift VR experience that i would buy this again and would recommend Rift to anyone! You have to try Robo Recall and Google Earth VR... they're both amazing!! Want to mention too that I bought the extra sensor for that 360° roomscale... it makes your VR experience completely immersive!

By far the best purchase I made last year. I purchased it to play with a flight simulator Il-2 sturmovik. There’s plenty of oculus reviews I’ll just focus on the pros and cons for the game I bought the headset mainly for.Pros: The immersion is far better than I expected. The best feature surprised me, which was that you have depth perception like in 3D movies. The only way I think this works is because you have two separate eye screens which makes telling distances completely intuitive. I actually find leading aircraft easier in VR than on a screen.I had to fly carefully for my first 10 hours or I’d get sick looking down at the ground below. After 15 hours or so Im doing loops and rolls and never feel sick.Cons: Spotting aircraft is a little tough in il-2 due to the screen door effect (lower res) but the VR zoom feature helps a lot. Requred a new processor and some graphics settings optimization to keep Il-2 running at 60-90 FPS.

I purchased a computer particularily because it was VR ready. I had a very difficult time to get it to connect up and when I did finally get the visual working on the head set, I was not impressed with the dropout on the image with a slight side to side eye movement. With a head rotation at all, the picture completely collapsed and was very slow to recover. The computer would crash completely and require a total re-boot to get the monitor to come back on. Ran through this pain a few times and returned the system for a refund. Should have bought a cheap computer and left VR to someone else to learn about.

Well lets start this review off with the positives but the negatives are VERY important.relevent system specs: win10, AMD R9290x i5-3690kPros: interesting novel feel of being ""inside"" the game.Extremely fun for non competitive and BVR aerial combat (slighly nauseating dogfighting in WW2 airplanes)Extremely fun for rally driving sims (dirt rally) as you get 3D depth perception making driving feel more realistic.Cons:Even though my video card supports the oculus rift you need to make sure your GPU has atleast 1 Available HDMI slot that is not occupied by your main or secondary monitor as you need to have your main display AND Oculus rift (OR) plugged into it simultaneously. (costed me 20 bucks for a VGA cord and my main monitor now uses VGA :(Lenses fog up constantly for about half an hour into your game session (probably depends on your local climate as not everyone experiences this.Low Resolution: Resolution is quite low so in war thunder simulated battles you only see a black dot without a visual indicator of what type of vehicle it is until its within 1k, with your monitor you can zoom in and tell via silhouette from easily 8+ km away what plane it is. Also textures tend to look much worse in your sim games (almost like there is no anti aliasing and your screens are very close to your face so you can see individual pixels.You tend to see a bloom affect from lighting due to the design of the lenses so you are frequently finding yourself fiddling with the device trying to keep it as centered as possible on your face to reduce obscurities. (this tends to take you out of the ""zone"" that VR has the tendency of getting you into.Many games get frame stutter and i'm not entirely sure if this is the device being poorly optimized or the fact that your GPU MUST display the game on your main display + 2 albeit lower resolution images (1 per eye) on the rift. This means a game you are normally displaying just once must now be displayed 3fold instead of 2fold.On December 14th a REQUIRED update that was unannounced or optional (also released Friday night due to inexperienced development company) bricked my device for the weekend. There is no way of rolling back my software for the device to use it for the weekend. (this isn't the first time this has happened either, march 2018)This device (and it would seem these devices) are meant for extremely casual gamers who spend enthusiast bucks and rich people who want the novel experience.

I have owned a rift for over a year and have never had a physical problem with it. There have been the occasional software glitches but nothing that hasn't been fixed pretty quickly. You need a fairly decent sized room if you want to do room scale, but I use it for racing/driving sims primarily and will not use a racing/driving game now unless it supports vr.  On a side note, if you want a second or even a third sensor if you have the touch bundle, I suggest you buy from oculus themselves if you live in Canada because their price is $79 vs $99 upwards to $140+ from sellers here....

Works even better than I expected. You definitely want to have as much space as possible. As for the 6 games they give you, 3 of them aren't really games. They're more artsy stuff like drawing and sculpting. But the 3 other games are pretty awesome for being free. The Robot one is basically full fledged VR game. The zombie one is fun and has online multiplayer. And Lucky's Tale doesn't necessarily need to be VR but it's surprisingly still really enjoyable being VR. Set up is pretty easy and straight forward. The cord is decently long but I ended up buying another 6 feet extension (HDMI and USB 3) just so I didn't have to worry. Might eventually buy another sensor for the full 360 tracking but it doesn't seem too important yet. My only concern is that Facebook owns Oculus now and I don't trust Facebook...

I got this at the $550ish price range so I am thoroughly pleased.  Some key things to keep in mind:  A) You need a VR-capable video card / machine.  That's not cheap.  B) You need a large enough area to make this work well.  10 by 10?  Doable but tight. Bigger really is better.  C) You are not going to like the resolution.  It's okay for now, but we're all holding our breath for the next gen with higher res.  Years? Maybe.  D) The hand tracking is amazingly well done.  E) The 2 sensors are good enough if you can get them high and in opposite corners of your play space.  FINAL) If you have / can afford all the other dependent things, and have been waiting for VR since you were a kid and love everything about it, go for it.  It's a blast.  Otherwise?  Visit someone who has one.  Have some fun.  Eventually, the novelty will wear off.

It's wonderful, works almost perfectly with only 2 sensors in a full roomscale 360 degree environment for me, note that i have absolutly nothing in the way that could obstruct it tho. Some small tracking problems here and there but it is sorta my fault... You don't need extra headphones or a microphone which are in the headset itself, the controllers feel great in the hand due to wonderful ergonomics and the field of view is quite nice. This product completly demolishes the Vive, which might have slightly better tracking out of the box, but with an extra sensor which will still leave you 200$ cheaper then the Vive (if you get an audio strap with the Vive it's more like 300...), then you'll even surpass the Vive!

Touch controllers are amazing, although my right one is having a weird issue with the bumper sticking when I press it down. I will update this review based on how Oculus/Amazon handles this issue

Got my own system during the summer sale, and I am super impressed. I used to play on (and develop for) the Vive at work, but the Oculus just feels more... polished. Vive's tracking and room-scale is better, but the highlight for me here are Oculus' touch controllers - super ergonomic and much smoother to use than Vive controllers.As for the content, depends on what you want to do. I've found dickin' around in Oculus Medium (which is a fantastic program!) or working out with Soundboxing to be my calling. There's plenty of decent content to keep you interested, and the games that come with the system are testaments to that - Robo Recall is prolly one of the best FPS in VR.For this price, it's an amazing piece of technology and will blow even the most skeptical away. Buy!

I just installed the Oculus Rift on my new computer. I encountered some minor problems during installation but I was able to get through with it. The result is simply fabulous. The first time you enter in a VR room, you almost think it’s real. You are completely cut off from the real world. I did not give five a 5 star rating because it took me numerous tries to get the setup finally working. You also need a powerful computer with a powerful video card.

When I first received the rift my expectations were really high and I was a little skeptic about the quality of this but let me tell you this is AMAZING! Everything about this is just perfect. The design, the interface, the games and way more! I ordered it with the green pack and the purple pack for the extra games. The first-party games are amazing like robo recall and lone echo to name them off the top of my head. The only con i have would be the 2 sensors included when there should be three. But either way I ordered a 3rd sensor and I don’t regret it at all! Over all I give the head set a 9/10.

The touch is a pretty awesome addition to the rift VR experience, if you can get it all to work together that is.Positives: hardware works greatWhen it works correctly the touch tracking feels spot on, and works very well.I've tested the beta roomscale setup, it kind of works, I can get a 360 play area about 5x5ft in size that works reasonably reliably. For a beta feature it works quite well, and since it's in beta still I'm ignoring any oddities with this setup until they fine tune it a bit more.Negatives: Driver/software issuesBiggest issue I've had with these is terrible driver/software issues. Getting all 3 devices to detect as USB 3 (rift and 2 sensors) appears to be next to impossible. (if anyone is wondering I am using the oculus recommended USB 3 pcie card with the Fresco logic chipset).Frequently one of the trackers or the rift will re-detect as a USB 2 device, which causes it to stop responding for 10seconds before it comes back again.  Just having the items plugged in and not in use, you can hear them disconnecting and reconnecting all day long. Oculus needs to look at this. Nothing is more nauseating than completely losing your head tracking while moving. These issues happened before the touch controllers were added, but now its much more frequent. I was originally going to buy a 3rd tracker for roomscale VR, but I'm going to hold off, hopefully they can figure the drivers out...My recommendation:If you already own a rift, buy the touch.The trackers do add a lot to the immersion, and they are worth buying. The touch ergonomics are great, and they are very intuitive to use and get used to. It's probably worth the buy even if you have to suffer through the driver issues.If you don't have a rift yet, consider the vive instead.I don't say this lightly as I've been an oculus fan since day one. But after my experience with the now whole experience, the HTC Vive is the better package. Their software supports the hardware very well. I've used my friends vive on countless occasions (we both took it to a friend's place and set the systems up side by side). I fiddled with mine for over an hour working on camera placement and angles,  he had his setup in about 15 minutes. And no USB da-dunk noises coming from his setup. The vive just works, the rift needs  'some encouragement' to work, and then it still complains once in a while.Update: January 26, 2017A quick update on the USB driver issues. After searching for a solution to the HMD or sensors dropping out randomly I got directed to Windows USB selective suspend. It's buried under the advanced options of the windows power profile settings. I made a new profile which I called VR, and disabled anything relating to USB and power savings. After this tweak, I'm happy to say my USB disconnect  issues are a thing of the past! I hope Oculus can find a way to get their software to override that setting somehow down the road. But for now this works for me.  Bumped up to a 4 star rating.

Ok before I get into the product I'll just say something about VR in general. IT'S AMAZING! I've been a gamer for 35+ years now and I haven't been so floored with a video game experience since I first tried 3D gaming with Mario 64! Aside from enjoying some portable gaming on my Switch, I've had a hard time going back to non VR gaming on a standard monitor. (and I have a high end liquid cooled PC with a 1080ti etc). I bought a 3'rd sensor and set things up for room scale and I've had no issues with tracking.As for the hardware itself, the headset feels nice and seems to be high quality although I've read about a lot of people eventually having issues with the sound on the right ear piece over time. I've also heard people say that there is a rubber piece in the trigger(s) of the touch controllers that are known to come off and cause the feel/tension of the triggers to change for the worse. After owning my Rift for only 1 month, the index finger trigger on the right touch controller sounds squeaky, like there may well be something going on with that trigger, although the feeling itself of the trigger remains the same, so far anyways. In regards to USB ports, I have tons of USB 3.0 ports but I kept getting notifications every few days that a given sensor was not tracking well or some such, and would redo the setup and have them be detected as being plugged in a USB 2.0 port although they were in fact in USB 3.0 ports. It bugged be enough I eventually bought a dedicated 4 x USB 3.0 port, 4 x USB Controllers, USB PCIE card and haven't had any issues in weeks since then.While I have yet to deal with customer service as my unit is still basically fine, (aside from the right touch index trigger starting to squeak) I've read a LOT of Rift related Customer Service horror stories on Reddit and the general consensus on Rift related CS seems to be that it is fairly bad. I find this somewhat surprising since the Rift should have all that FaceBook money to support it; It's not like it's backed by some little startup.

VR is amazing. The headset is pretty great, the controllers are comfy but apparently customer service is rather lacking.

I did go to a local store where you can rent both Rift and Vive for 1 hrs each. Even if the Oculus were more expensive I would still choose Oculus over Vive. Both headset are awesome, tracking is perfect for both... But the Vive controller are a joke compare to the Rift. With the Touch you get the perfect immertion, you forgot that you have a controller and think you use your real hand in game. Vive controller are just non natural huge stick. Maybe the initial setup is a little bit harder on Rift, but do yourself a favor and buy wall mount  like this one https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B06WRWV7RT/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ... Once correctly set, you will be done forever with setting and enjoy awesome immertion.

Room scale works flawlessly with 3 sensors. Excellent build and solid with many ways to adjust for comfort. Very light and tracking is super accurate. I have been a gamer since the early 80's and this is by far the most amazing piece of hardware I've ever bought. Games are more fun than ever, thanks to this. I have high end screens and don't mind this not being 4K. I don't even notice it since it's so much fun and the graphics are still impressive especially if you can super sample with your rig. Don't let the price or the talk fool you, this IS currently the best headset on the market! It is light, you can read text with it and has superb sound from the built-in headphones. (I'm rather picky about sound too) The controllers are just amazing and you get six good to excellent games. Just get it.

Great product. Beats the HTC Vive hands down. I tried both before I purchased and there were no questions after. It sits on the head in a balanced way. I haven't had tearing or disconnect. Can't go wrong with the Oculus!  I do wish they offered compatable extension cables and a third sensor through the company instead of having to hunt them down.

...and so the VR wars start.  People going on which system is better...  The Rift is great,  never tried the Vive, so I can not compare.  I used the Rift mostly on games such as DCS World and Elite Dangerous.  Both cockpit based games.  Changes a lot with the experience , even if you're using a TrackIR or something similar.  FPS games are completely different than just using a mouse and keyboard.  Instead of clicking a button to aim down the sights, you move the weapon to your eye.  If you shoot rifles in real life, you may find it very awkward to use them in VR.  Not having a stock to put in your shoulders, or a fore-end to hold weird.  One handed weapons, such as handguns and knives are okay.  Bows are in between.  You trade off some visuals for an immersive 3D experience.  If Dead Space became a VR game, I would need lots of spare pants.  The number one thing do realize, is that VR is still in an experimental stage.  Spending over $500, on something you don't know if you'll like is a gamble.  I have zero regrets on my Rift, and can't wait when the 2nd gen of VR comes out.  I refuse to play any flight/space simulator anymore, unless I have a VR headset.

Its nice the graphics are OK up close but any distance is not great  head set is comfortable but sweaty as it gets warm about 20 or thirty minutes is all I can stand between the sweat in the eyes and nausea, flying games are OK but get too close to the ground and the stomach starts rolling  VR will be great soon I think but just not up to par yet, but looks promising it is an awesome experience even with the for mentioned things I didn't like, do not regret my purchase but for now just a novelty as I still do  %90  of my gaming on conventional monitors.

Although it is a fantastic product, my standards are higher than the average consumer when it comes to video games. Although this provides a fantastic experience when playing something that doesn't have fast movements from side to side, it's not that great for racing games. The resolution is too blurry to see the dashboard gauges and when looking to my side to see another car, there is a double image that hurts my eyes.Apart from the headset, the touch controllers are amazing. Very comfortable and light and easy to learn. When you get this product, make sure to try Robo Recall and Echo Arena (possible motion sickness at first but you'll get used to it).This is a quality product when it comes to VR, only get this if you have the money for it and absolutely need it. If you are a gamer into higher end gear, wait for the next generation.

We love the Oculus. It's so much fun. There are games for the family, games that make you sweat and provide a great workout. It's truly amazing. The future of gaming for sure. Just a warning to people looking at buying it. Read the limited warranty. They only provide you with a refurbished device if you have a hardware problem. We ran into a hardware problem 1 month in and they are telling us they are sending us a refurbished unit. Not okay. They only have email support and it takes them days to reply. You will never speak to a live person. Common occulus, get with the times, everyone has online chat support these days. I'm not saying don't buy the Oculus. I think for price, it's an amazing product. Just research before you buy. Look at the other VR competitors and see what their service is like by reading forums, and find out what their warranty period is before buying. We can't wait for A headset to be returned. We've grown to love it and have had so much fun with it, in the little time we've had it.

If you are on the fence about VR this setup is amazing. I looked into it a bit before buying and bought the 3rd sensor and any extension cables required for true roomscale and installed it like that. Blew my mind. Its so great. Ive never used the conpetitors hut will say this. Occulus is all about the user experience. They want smooth gameplay and a good experience, so sometimes wont put features in even though it might say look better but could end up causing stuttering or small jerks. This means in general an occulus experience will be a good one. I highly recommend. Hard to play normal pc games after this. Something as simple as google earth is amazing in vr, flying around, frombsitting on the top of mount everest to watching the sun come up over mount fiji. Its feels like you are there, and you just dont get that feeling in normal google earth.  I have zero regrets about this purchase.

It took me about a week to get this headset working between tech support(no help) and eventually having to do a clean windows install.  I spent about a hundred additional in peripheral upgrades like pci-e usb 3.0 card and hdmi and usb extensions which you need because the cords that come with it are only about 6 ft long.  Once it works it is amazing, the resolution is insane on the head set and tracks really well.  I would have given it 5/5 if it didn't need the extensions and was such a complete pain to setup.

Bought this for work ( I work for a physical rehab clinic), was supper complicated to set up on windows 7 because I kept getting an error installing occulus home. Once I figured a work around that, the headset would not be detected...After 10+ hours of troubleshooting, I found out I had to re-install windows 7 and manually install certain security updates from the Microsoft website before turning on automatic updates on the pc.

Amazing headset, I love the controllers on this one more than the ones that the Vive has to offer, and when I purchased this during the rift summer sale it was $700 CAD less than the Vive (Less than half the price). I can't believe how much fun you can have with a Rift! I recommended getting at least one more sensor to really get the immersion. I personally ordered 2 extra for a total of 4 because of my oddly shaped room, but I don't have any issues whatsoever with tracking, both up high and down low.

Makes more of a difference than you think in general - Makes a HUGE difference immersion wise - Great at blocking out other sound.  Only negative is they just dangle there..would have been nice if Oculus thought ahead and made some sort of clips or method of attaching them to the headset when not in use (I just dangle mine up over the headset, but they are still bouncing around)Cables are also about 1 inch shorter than they should be - RIGHT on the border of being too short so it feels when putting them on that if i adjust my headset a little bit, I could pop them right out of my ears.

I was honestly a bit disappointed when using the Oculus Rift headset on its own. I never felt immersion, being able to look around a space was interesting but not really worth the low resolution of the headset.After getting these everything changed. I feel much more immersed in games, shooting and picking up objects with my real hands provides gameplay experiences I've never experienced before, and I don't even notice the low resolution anymore because I'm so immersed and most gameplay with these controllers involves interacting with objects close to you.If you are interested in VR, these are essential to the experience. They are a bit expensive but feel worth the price. They do not need a USB port, once you insert the AA batteries into the controllers and press a button, your Oculus app should detect them automatically. A lot of effort was clearly put into the design and ease of use of these controllers.

The hype is real. If you haven't tried a VR system from one of the three main players - Oculus, Vive, and Sony - and think it's not worth looking into, you're clearly missing out.I've tried Sony's PS VR last October launch and was floored on how ""real"" it can seem. From the get go this was the poor man's choice. For under a grand (including the console), you have a great VR system.Fast forward to three months later and Oculus finally improves their VR system in December 2016 with the release of their Oculus Touch. To date these are hands down the best VR controllers you could ever use. No dorky Sony Move motion controllers with a big ball of light at the end. No gamepad devices needed at all. And that's the point of this Oculus bundle - to prove once and for all who is the best at making a VR system.This bundle takes pre-existing hardware - the Oculus Rift, 2 x Oculus Touch devices (for each hand), and 2 x Oculus Sensors - and packages it into one big box.So unlike the earlier days where you get a ""free"" Microsoft Xbox One controller with the package (simply because they didn't have the Touch then), now you can kiss the gamepad goodbye and rightly so. Using the Touch is so comfortable after an hour of actual play and the device becomes natural to hold and the resulting buttons become second nature.GET READY:1. You'll need a PC that meets minimum specs. If you're not a techie and don't know or understand what you have, all you need to do is download and run the Oculus Compatibility Check Tool.If you have an older machine and would like to take the opportunity to upgrade, I would highly suggest looking into their Oculus-ready certified computers from manufacturers such as Asus. If you're a techie, then you probably built one yourself and at this point more than meets the recommended requirements.2. In that PC you will need the following extra outlets:- 2 x USB 3.0 ports for the two Oculus Sensors (not USB 2.0 ports on this one)- 1 x USB 2.0 port for the Oculus Rift hardware for power and digital audio- 1 x HDMI port from your video card which effectively makes the Rift a second (or third) monitor depending on your current set up.- optional (1 x USB 3.0 port for the third Oculus Sensor for true 360 degree of play)GET SET:From unpacking the bundle, you can get a head start by already downloading the Oculus software. This application is essential and walks you through connecting the devices into your computer, to getting you up and running by positioning the Sensors correctly and creating room boundaries, to finally explaining how their VR works in conjunction with the Touch controllers.GO:The same Oculus software installs the actual application that runs the Oculus hardware. Whenever you wear the headset, it sends a signal back to the computer and launches the application, if it isn't open already. This is the gateway to running everything that feeds into the Rift controlling the Sensors.The software is also where you purchase and download games and movies. After having set up and registered your Oculus Touch this is where you check which free games (if included) you can download as well.Most of the games/videos are around 1GB in size so not only will you need a fast internet connection, you'll definitely need a very big hard drive as it fills up fast.REALITY OF VIRTUAL REALITY:You'll want a computer system that runs on the recommended specifications. This ensures zero lag. Remember, your world is now 360 degrees and your computer processing needs to keep up with you as you interact in the VR world in real-time. When you look, up, down, left, right and all the way back, everything needs to be rendered and there for you instantaneously to interact.First-time users can also expect to have motion sickness. It does take getting used to in having your senses adapt to the VR world.So why choose Oculus?For one, comfort. The headset isn't heavy, but it's not light either. They have created one that is very easy to wear and very easy to make adjustments. The velcro straps for the left, right, and top bands are easy to move about. This is important especially while wearing and when sharing among different users.There is one long cable attached to the headset and onto your computer which splits into an HDMI and USB port. This is unlike HTC Vive's more awkward cable set up. The least you can do is try to have cables including the headset itself be unobtrusive as you immerse yourself into the VR world. In the future when VR can finally go wireless, this won't be an issue.The Touch is the most comfortable and most intuitive gaming pad than the other two. It fits natural and feels like an extension to your hand. Where the Touch starts and ends is where you expect your whole hand to be. No extra length like the Vive and no glowing ball like the PS VR.There are exclusive contents between the three VR providers and that's the reality you just have to accept. Some of these exclusive contents do cross-over to the other platforms as the exclusivity ends unless it's co-devloped by the manufacturer themselves.And with Oculus, you can actually run Valve's games by enabling third-party support.I wouldn't hesitate recommending Oculus VR hardware and would buy two if this was possible in one PC. It's the best combination out there for 2017. And with the Summer of Rift promotion, you can't go wrong. It's been a hit that supply couldn't keep up with demand. And in fact Sony followed suit and lowered their PS VR pricing as well.Don't hesitate. The hype is real for Oculus.

I bought this a year ago, very few days went by without me putting this thing on my face. I met a lot of peoples in Oculus home, VR chat etc. even made a few good friends. Some have the new rift S some have the GO and the Quest from what I heard from peoples who have them all or a few, the original Rift is the best, all of them have their plus and minus but even with the pain of setting up the sensors the original Rift seems to be the best bang for bucks. You definitely need a dedicated place to set it up once and for all and there's the cable but it's just awesome. Some peoples will b**ch about the poor resolution and that the other is better but believe me once you put this on the resolution is definitely not what you focus on. I don't have eagle eyes and that (for some) annoying ""screen door effect"" is not a problem for me, I just focus on the content like i'm supposed to do instead of squinting my eyes to look for the annoying things. I replaced the foam face thing with a VR cover(VR cover.com) The headphones on the headset broke after a while and I'm using a separate pair of headphones, no problems what so ever to replace. After a year and a few months i'm still happy I bought the original Rift

When watching people play VR on YouTube, I assumed it was just like a game screen in front of your face where you controlled the look by moving your head...which sounded fun, so I bought one.Holy cow! When actually putting on VR it is much more realistic than just a game screen in front of your eyes, plus the graphics look different, less cartoony, more realistic.I wear glasses to see far away, I assumed that because I was putting a screen close to my eyes that I would not need glasses, but this thing emulates real life so well that I actually need to wear my glasses.I have a basic gaming PC that does not meet the minimum requirements, although I can still play some things, it is enough of a motivator for me to build a better gaming rig, but for now I can do enough on my current PC.2 Cons:1) I went to plug in my rift this morning only to find that the HDMI was not working, I tried another item in the same HDMI port and it worked, so I thought my rift was broken...Turns out I just had to unplug and replug where the cable connects to the actual headset. It would be nice if I was told to try this as I had to google a lot of articles, most telling me that my computer/rift was broken.2) After coming back to ""reality"" I do feel a slight wavyness, kinda like the feeling you get after you get off a rollercoaster, but not as intense. This lasts for about 5-10 minutes then goes away. It would be nice if they could somehow get rid of this side-effect.My favorite part of the VR experience is when things almost kill you, like in robo recall when the robots turn from good robots to bad robots and come at you, or when the spider robots jump and almost land on you, but you shotgun them before they damage you. These scenarios are actually terrifying yet so much fun at the same time.This brings gaming to a whole new level, you gotta try this thing! 10/10

I can't say much other than I didn't even try and use two sensors when I bought my Oculus. I ended up ordering a 3rd one from Amazon early and it was here a day before I planned to purchase my Oculus. (purchased Oculus Rift in store at Best Buy because Amazon would take 2 months to deliver.) Sensor works great. I'm using it with https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01FJJ3Q2K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 (light stands) and https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0179LJV6Q/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 (so I can adjust them). The box came with a 16ft 2.0 usb active extender by monoprice so don't do what I did and assume you need one and waste 18 bucks.

I ordered this directly from Oculus during the boxing week sale and got it even cheaper with a referral discount. The packaging is awesome and I haven't had a better unboxing experience than this. Everything comes well secured and the sensors are even held into place in the box by velcro that's a part of the box. Everything came well protected and setup was quick and easy when you follow the instructions in the software. I do run a pretty basic full room setup for games like beat saber and superhot. If you want a proper full room setup you will need a third sensor at least and I plan on making it four. Love it and recommend it highly.

Rift itself is great. No issues with setup etc. Although I highly recommend looking into using the debug tool turn up the supersampling to 1.5 so it's not so blurry. That's if your pc can handle it.You will need a third sensor to be able to turn around without it losing track of your hands.The game bundle is not good. The only thing worth playing is robo recall. Two of the games are for drawing, one is a lame tech demo, Lucky tale is just a old school platformer that will make you a bit dizzy.

Product is as advertised. i can't recommend it though on account of windows not supporting this many usb devices.To make the 3rd sensor work requires at the least 2 usb device controllers in your pc, and possibly an externally powered usb hub. I have a 1kw psu and can't plug 3 of these in. Keeps saying poor tracking or not recognizing the device/usb port. Buy a Vive instead of the oculus rift as the 2 sensors it comes with are more than enough for most setups.

My friend purchased this and I got to use it. It's pretty much all I can think about! Completely blew my mind. My own computer isn't currently powerful enough to run an Oculus, but that's the only thing holding me back from buying one. You should check out the game, The Climb to see just how different and amazing the experience of VR is. It's an infinite screen - you can look in any direction at any time. The visuals are all LIFE size. And you can actually move around and see your hands in a virtual world! The only thing holding this back is the need for a more powerful computer, but that's only a few years away for most people, I think! VR is coming!

Great product, very fun games. However the first one I received had a line of vertical blue stuck pixels. I noticed it on the first day and replaced through amazon easily. Then when I got the replacement the trigger on one of the new controllers needed to be pressed a little harder to register a full press. Not a huge deal but for sure bothersome. So did another replacement (very easily again, no questions asked) and finally seem to have a fully functional set.The games and apps are truely amazing, never experienced anything like it before. It’s like being in an interactive 3D movie.Despite my problems, Amazon customer service and speed on the replacements was top notch both times.

Excellent technology. The Rift Headset is amazing already.  The Touch controllers feel great in your hands, well balanced, with more options for interactions than the Vive controllers.  VR is the future of computer interfaces. Buying the Touch includes over 100$ worth of games and sculpting software too, such as The Unspoken, Dead and Buried, Robo Recall, Medium, Quill. Try Rec Room paintball as well, good fun.  It does need a bit of space to move around in and some tinkering due to some problems with USB 3 sensors not getting enough consistent power, so Oculus recommends getting an extra USB 3.0 PCI card (Inatek one on Amazon is ~ 30$) and disabling power management on USB ports.  I used a powered USB hub and that helped me.  So then there are also all the Steam/Vive games the oculus can now play because it is SteamVR compatible.  There is so much software/games now for it, that I can't get to it all. Sims, shooters, arcade, social, etc.  With the Touch, Oculus has completed their VR vision and caught up (and surpassed even?) to the Vive and once it is all working well, it is a marvel to play with.

[UPDATE vom 27. Januar 2019]Ich muss hier mal kurz was richtig stellen, da ausgerechnet die verlogenste und falscheste (Ein-Stern-)Rezension ganz oben als Top-Rezension gelistet wird.Sie ist einfach komplett falsch und zieht das Image dieses grandiosen Produkts völlig zu Unrecht in den Dreck.Erstens: ""Spionage seitens Facebook""--> Man kann die Brille/Software komplett ohne Facebook verwenden und man muss sich nicht über Facebook anmelden. Das ist Fakt, Punkt.Eine einfache Registrierung mit ausgedachtem Nutzernamen, Passwort und Email genügt um die Oculus Rift in vollem Funktionsumfang zu nutzen.Zweitens: ""10EUR im Monat für Batterien""--> Ich weiß ja nicht wo Sie ihre Batterien beziehen, aber für 10€-12€ inklusive Versand bekomme ich auf Amazon 40 Batterien, die etwa eineinhalb Jahre halten dürften. 30h Batterielaufzeit ist auch nicht wenig, sondern sehr viel.Ich benutze einfache AA-Akkus, welche ich etwa alle 4 Wochen (noch vor Entladung) auswechsle und auflade.Drittens: ""Beschränkung bei der Sensoreinrichtung""--> Man kann die EMPFEHLUNGEN, die Sensoren anders im Raum aufzustellen GANZ EINFACH per ""Weiter"" überspringen und mit der Einrichtung fortfahren.Man kann die Sensoren aufstellen wie man möchte und es gibt keine Probleme.So...Und ich möchte nach ziemlich genau einem halben Jahr Nutzung nun nocheinmal sagen, wie zufrieden ich mit der Oculus Rift bin. Ich habe schon sehr viel Zeit in der virtuellen Realität verbracht und viele unvergessliche Spiele gespielt und Erfahrungen gesammelt.Weiterhin kann ich dieses Headset jedem wärmstens ans Herz legen.Es gab bisher wirklich niemanden, der zu Besuch kam, die Rift testete und nicht völlig von ihr gehyped war.Die Zukunft des Gamings hat begonnen![Ursprüngliche Rezension vom 21. Juli 2018]Ok ein paar Worte...Ich hatte zuvor die Samsung Gear VR mit der Oculus Home Software und das war schon ganz gut.Aber das hier ist einfach unfassbar geil und noch viel viel viel (...) besser!Habe mir das Rift Bundle inkl. zwei Controllern am Prime-Day für 399€ gekauft und ich kann nur sagen es war jeden Cent wert!Die Controller fühlen sich an wie die Verlängerung einer echten Hand. Das sorgt für perfekte Immersion.Übrigens reichen die beiden beigelegten Sensoren für ein 360°-Setup.Wenn man sie in die USB-3.0-Frontpanel Steckplätze steckt braucht man noch nicht einmal Verlängerungskabel.Ich habe mir dennoch 2x 3m Amazon Basics USB-3.0-Kabel dazugekauft um sicherzugehen, dass der Platz reicht.Jedenfalls muss man in der Kalibrierung einfach die Warnung ignorieren, dass die zwei Sensoren etwas zu weit auseinander stehen.Für ein optimales 360°-Setup sollte einer der beiden Sensoren von unten und der andere von oben auf den Spielbereich gerichtet sein.Desweiteren sollten sie genau 180° zueinander stehen, damit alles genaustens abgedeckt wird.Danach muss man wirklich keinerlei Abstriche machen - Es funktioniert perfekt!Wer bei 400€ nicht zuschlägt ist wirklich selbst Schuld.Günstiger wirds nicht. Habe mir wie gesagt noch 2x Kabel dazugekauft, sowie heute noch ein VR-Cover/Polster, da man beim längeren Zocken schon ein wenig ins Schwitzen kommen kann und dann dieser schwammartige Schaumstoff sich mit Schweiß vollsaugt.Allerdings kann man diesen recht schnell wieder mit einem Handtuch trocken drücken. Ein bisschen unhygienisch finde ich es trotzdem, weshalb ich mir das Polster bestellt habe.Angeblich soll 2020 die Nachfolgegeneration erscheinen.In zwei Jahren wird also aufgerüstet - Ich bin völlig verzaubert.Please take all my money!Danke.PS:Die Oculus braucht MINDESTENS eine Grafikkarte des Typs GTX970.Ich habe sie auch auf meinem Laptop mit der deutlich langsameren GTX970M betrieben, was akzeptabel funktioniert in anspruchslosen Anwendungen und Spielen. Ich empfehle jedoch dringend mindestens eine GTX1060.Selbst nutze ich eine übertaktete und wassergekühlte GTX1080 mit Power-Limit-Mod.Je besser die Grafikkarte, desto besser das Erlebnis! Das muss einem klar sein.

Stunning, absolutely stunning.I got a little bonus through work that significantly reduced the 'real' money cost of my picking up a Rift, which I had been mulling over for a while, so I pulled the trigger and bought it.  Had I known what the experience would be like, I would have paid full price a long time back.I last used a VR headset probably in the early 90's on an old arcade cabinet, and remember the screen chugging along to keep up with my head movements.  As my PC, while reasonably pokey, is getting on a bit in years, with a 980GTX powering it, I envisaged something similar.  Wrong.  When you put the headset on, every tiny movement of your head is replicated in real-time in your view through the Rift.  It can be quite disconcerting - one of the early things I did was a series of demos, one of which places you on a gantry hundreds of feet above a city street, which made my stomach back-flip with vertigo despite knowing I was stood in the middle of my office.But what about the games Snowy, I hear you ask?  £400 is a lot to put down just for a clever tech demo right?  Well there are some amazing titles.  Robo Recall - free with the Oculus Touch controller package - is great fun, shooting, punching, tearing robots to pieces.  Skyrim VR is quite breathtaking (although I had forgotten the giant spiders, which in VR are utterly massive and made this late-40's male reviewer make a VERY un-heroic squeak).  SuperHot VR makes you feel like Neo from The Matrix, grabbing weapons, hurling objects, all while avoiding incoming bullets and enemies.  Beat Sabre will become a party-game classic with it's rhythm-based lightsaber action.  I own but have yet to try Subnautica.The game that has wowed me the most though, Elite Dangerous.  I have played E:D since the beta, and always loved the scale of the game.  Played in VR it is a completely different experience though, as you are teleported into your ship's cockpit, and suddenly the scale of the world around you is breathtaking.  Space stations are immense, planets and suns look like...planets and suns.  Other spaceships can be huge.  Glancing at different screens within the ship lets you adjust things on the fly that would usually require extensive keyboard shortcuts, so I fly using my Saitek X52 setup exclusively.  Dogfighting enemy ships is a whole new experience, as you naturally head-track them, allowing you to fly that much more accurately and aggressively.  It really is mindblowing what a difference a new perspective makes.All told, this will not be a flash in the pan gimmick, it is a truly revolutionary experience.  If you are on the fence, take the plunge, you will not regret it.

Alleine wegen der Spionage seitens Facebook, und wie aufwendig die Workarounds dafür sind gibt es bereits 2 Sterne Abzug, desweiteren Wird alles was man im Virtuellen Raum von näher als einen halben Meter betrachtet extrem verschwommen, was ein bekanntes Problem ist, ich hab mich darüber mit einigen Oculus und Vive Nutzern unterhalten, es ist ein Fehler seitens Oculus der selbst nach 2 Jahren nicht behoben wurde. Dann wären da noch die AA Batterien in den Controllern die ca. 30h halten also entweder 10EUR im Monat für Batterien ausgeben oder Akkus kaufen, und so oder so muss man die Dinger andauernd tauschen was absolut nervig ist und nichts im Jahr 2018 verloren hat. Einen weiteren Stern musste ich wegen der absolut lachhaften Beschränkung bei der Sensoreinrichtung abziehen. man muss mindestens 1,5m vom Sensor entfernt sein, Sie müssen Zentral aufgestellt sein, ich will sie verdammmtnochmal aufstellen wie ICH will, nicht wie Oculus es VORSCHREIBT. Dann hätten wir da noch den Preis welcher nach wie vor absolut übertrieben ist, dennoch werde ich bei all den Mängeln lieber 600 EUR für die Vive in die Hand nehmen.Fazit: Ich rate vom Kauf ab.Edit: Ich bezahle lieber mit EURO als mit meiner Privatsphäre. Ich habe jetzt seit einer Woche die Vive und bin glücklich damit. Und die meckert auch nicht bei der Sensoreinrichtung rum, bei der kann ich sogar hingehen und einen Sensor unter meinen verdammten Schreibtisch stellen, funzt perfekt, die Oculus meckert, mimimi du bist zu nah an den Sensoren, mimimi die Sensoren sind zu nah beieinander, mimimi sie sind nicht zentral, mimimi du musst einen nach außen drehen. Es ist ein krampf bei kleineren Räumen... Ach und bei meiner momentanen Nutzung wären es sogar 20 EURO im Monat für Batterien, NEIN DANKE.

Here are the major issues with VR at the moment:1. almost all games/experieces are expensive gimmicks, meant to keep you interested an hour at best; some of them are only a few hours long;2. The best games out there, in which you manually move your character, produce nausea and need to be played in short bursts;3. easy to get caught in cables when using the headset;4. large playspace required for best feeling; best I can do is 1.50m x 1.50m and i can feel the borders;5. graphical textures are sub-par, resembling something of the 16-bit textures of the original Medal of Honor;6. all VR websites are, at the moment, gimmicks. fun to see once, maybe twice, but not exactly part of your daily feed;7. (Oculus VR specific) very finicky to set-up; had to look up online solutions since one of the sensors wouldn't install; you also need 3 (THREE) USB ports free and 1 HDMI port, which is a bit bollocks; at that price you'd think it could come with a USB extension;8. Gets EXTREMELY hot under the headset;9. If you have a big head and glasses, better get some contact lenses, otherwise it's impossible to wear them comfortably.It's not all bad though and when it hits, it hits home. VR is by far the most immersive experience you will get with a game; no-matter how bad the graphics are, you can't beat the ""being there"" feeling. Also some of the most fun games/apps to use with it are cheap or free and a few of the games the Oculus VR comes with are rather fun.But the main problem is that VR at the moment is a gimmick. A fun gimmick with great potential but still too expensive for what it has to offer (and that's just talking about headset price, without adding high-end PCs into the mix).If you are not rich and don't live in a mansion with your own gaming room, wait a few more years until the next gen of headsets come out. For everybody else, Oculus VR is currently the superior choice on the market but that's not saying much.

I could just blow smoke up you know where telling you all about this and that feature and how great it is, however you will never know unless you try it yourself because nothing, and I do mean nothing can prepare you for what you'll experience in VR as the level of immersion is on an entirely different level.I've investigated spacial anomalies and rescued my captain as an AI robot, to exploring the depths of an ocean planet where I've crashed landed on. Driven cargo with a truck to flooring it through a dense forest in a rally car. Danced the night away slashing boxes with lightsabers to traversing creepy buildings or watching movies on a massive 50ft screen.After 7 months of use, I've just replaced the original 1xAA battery in each controller after light to moderate use since buying. At £349 when I purchased, this has been the single most best purchase in the last year. Do yourself a favour, invest in this piece of kit, you will not be disappointed.

I owned the HTC VIVE previously before buying this, I must say I am very impressed by how this feels over the VIVE, if I was to compare on comfort alone this is in a different league! Feels much lighter and the build in speakers are perfect for what you need.Controllers feel much better than the weird VIVE wands too.On a slightly negative side you can easily see that VR still has a long way to go to being perfect, the god rays can be annoying and the resolution isnt anything to write home about.. however as a first generation its still very fun to play around in and id highly recommend buying one if you have a decent enough computer to run it, also Rec Room is probably one of the most fun games I have played.

VR is not for everyone. Make sure you try it somehow before buying as it makes some people nauseous. If you can handle it, have a decent spec PC, a few square metres of space and the money to spare then this is a good buy. I use mine a lot. It's not just games, there are experiences to be had too. You can explore the world map in Google earth or see what astronaughts saw flying to the moon. There are horror movies you can watch that are immersive and creepy. The surround sound from the built in speakers add another layer of depth to any experience. The games range from amazing to very poor as is the case with 2d gaming but all games in the oculus store and on steam have user reviews so there's no need to waste money on the rubbish. Some games require more space than others but the oculus store will warn you before you buy so again you need not waste money. The kit itself is sturdy and well made. The touch controllers are intuitive and comfortable and well thought out. I love mine, it's nice just to escape the real world for a bit. It's also good for a bit of exercise. Games like robo recall and beat sabre will have you using your arms a great deal and you'll break a sweat in no time.

I find it hard to give much credulity to all the gushing reviews about this product. I recognise that, in reasonable conditions, VR can be very stimulating and occasionally impressive. But once you get over the initial shock of seeing 2d images in 3d, you start to assess the woeful shortcomings of the Oculus Rift.Before that I'd like to comment on the setup process. If I go to a store and buy a monitor or tv, I pay the price, bring the box home, set up the device and it works. I do not need to go online and open an account. There is a manual which explains how to set the monitor up, and I certainly do not have to join Facebook to get it working.But no, Oculus forces you not only to be online, but also forces you through a ridiculous setup process which has little to do with helping you to actually run it with decent instructions, but is obsessed with you opening an online account, entering your payment details, and joining facebook. While you can opt out of some of these requirements, Oculus makes it awkward to do so. I DON'T WANT TO JOIN FACEBOOK just to run a visual device. I do not want to give Oculus my personal details so they can now send me endless emails urging me to buy more stuff. I do not want to give them my personal data so they can perpetually badger me to buy more - the device cost enough as it is.By all means give me a CLEAR OPTION, but the setup process is all about marketing, and very little to do with helping me run the Rift effectively.Coming to the Rift itself, I concede that the introductory setup 3d video is amusing, intelligent and a pleasure. The sensor setup is very fiddly and is aimed almost entirely at a user who wants to stand up and thrash around. But actuall, the vast majority of users want to sit down while viewing in VR and do not want a vast area to maneouvre in. But the Oculus setup doesn't like you setting a small, seated area and keeps rejecting any setup that is less than around six feet squared.The packaging is well done and the touch devices and headset at first glance look quite well done, but there are two major flaws with this device. The first is that Oculus claims that using spectacles is no problem. That is completely false. I need glasses, and I have several of them, for reading, distance viewing and other purposes and they are all different strengths. I also have spectacles that have the smallest possible dimensions. NONE of the glasses were wearable with the RIft, Even the tiniest glasses got jammed in the very small space between my nose and the Oculus lenses even if I pulled the fitting to its fullest length. Once you start wearing the device, the tiniest spectacles jam against the lenses, scratching them and also making it impossible to get the headset off with embedding my glasses in the sidewall of the device. That is an ergonomic disaster.Despite the impressive and well built sensors and touch devices, which work very well, the major letdown of the Rift is the lenses. They are of extremely poor quality, scratch easily, get clouded up at the slightest provocation and the horizontal adjustment is far too small. My eyes are an average distance apart but the somewhat tacky adjustment for distance between the lenses is FAR too wide. They need to have a much greater adjustment potential and I would guess that nearly everyone adjusts the lenses to be as close together as possible.There is a so-called ""sweet spot"" where Oculus claims the lenses come sharply into focus in the vertical plane, but this is also completely untrue. The amount of leeway between vaguely in focus and completely blurred is absolutely tiny. Just half a millimeter rotation up or down makes any detail or text grossly blurred.Now we come to the settings menu, together with the FAQ and so-called ""guides"" on the Oculus website. NOWHERE on the website or the instructions does Oculus tell you that there is a ""debug"" mode, without which you will not achieve anything near even vaguely acceptable images. Why is it called ""debug"" mode and buried away in a folder, unannounced, within the many folders in the Oculus directory? It is a VITAL aid to decent adjustment of many parameters. If you rely on Oculus to help you get to this debug mode, forget it. I only found out by researching away from Oculus's own website. How stupid of them!Not only that but there is no proper explanation of what various ""debug"" paraments do. The explanations are woefully inadequate.Coming to the resolution and quality or otherwise of the moving image, I have to say I am underwhelmed. I accept that resolution is low for practical reasons and I also accept there is quite a bit of screen door interference. But there is also a huge amount of chromatic aberration, colour mismatches, unwanted flare, washed out contrast, artefacts, etc, all of which point to the poor quality of the lenses, which are by far the most import component. While the packaging and presentation is generally good, the lenses are the one component Oculus have skimped on. They are not up to the job.I use the Rift mainly for flight simulation. Once you've adjusted to the at-first quite impressive and wondrous 3d world you are immersed in, you start to realise that the aircraft gauges are quite impossible to read unless you zoom in ridiculously close, but then the surrounding scenery turns into a mushy blur. It is not that the resolution is too low, or that the screen door effect is off-putting. They are by-products of an as yet unsophisticated technology. What I object to is that the entire image is poor, blurry, fuzzy and indistinct.3d videos do present much better and certain games and other sims just about make the cost of this device worthwhile, but there are so many basic flaws in this device I have to conclude this hardware is nowhere near the standard that could be described as useful in the long term.I recognise that VR is still in comparitive infancy, but Oculus has concentrated too much on nice boxes and slick looking components at the expense of the most important item, the lenses and the fitting of the headset. While it is a bit lighter than the Vive, it is not comfortable for more than around 20 minutes, and after 3 minutes the pressure on the nose support of spectacles is intolerable.I simply do not understand why this product has won so many five star ratings, and I'd be interested to read some long term assessments, which I suspect will starft showing irritation with the basic flaws in this device. While 3d is of course magical and stimulating, this product is nowhere near the sophistication in needs to be in order to use with much enthusiasm in the long term.I realise 3d monitors and Nvidia glasses are now old fashioned, but arguably they give a much better experience than donning a claustrophic device with very poor optics. So it's a thumbs down from me.

This item is a must have for VR lovers. 360 tracking is smooth, fast and adds the extra immersion to the games you play. before I purchased the third sensor, I was almost unable to get the enjoyment I wanted out of games like Robo Recall and Echo arena. Having that extra sensor not only gives you 360* tracking, but it also allows your play space to be slightly larger and your controllers will not ever lose track when you are inside your play space. If you use the oculus and play games like Robo Recall, Echo arena, Lone echo, Rick and Morty: Virtual Rickality, Super Hot VR and any other 360* games, then the third sensor is something you wont regret buying. (Each sensor you purchase also comes with an extension cable that is about 4 meters in length).

As an 80's kid I grew up in the time of Nintendo NES, Sega Megadrives, Gameboys etc... It was great, and as a kid it all seemed kind of amazing... then it all became...well, a bit familiar and boring. Graphics have got better, games more complex but you never get that giddy wow feeling you did as a kid. Well Oculus Rift is like re-living that youth, it genuinely is the next big leap in gaming...and the first time you put it on I guarantee you'll be grinning from ear to ear.Although £399 seems expensive, it's an amazing bit of kit, and assuming you have the hardware already to run VR, it's a no brainer at this price. Everything is extremely well made, it looks and feels every bit of it's £400 asking price. Setup is relatively simple...it takes a while but you are walked through each step in the software.It is worth nothing my graphics card has one HDMI port and three DisplayPort's....this is quite a common setup and if you have your monitor plugged into the HDMI port, you need to move it. I purchased a 4K DisplayPort to HDMI adaptor... I tried it initially with the Rift but although recognised in the software, it displayed a blank screen. Easy fix, just swap your monitor/TV over to the DisplayPort and use the HDMI for the Rift.The bundle doesn't include the Xbox controller anymore, but to be honest, the Touch controllers are so superior you would never use it anyway. They feel very natural to use and don't really have any learning curve. Also the fact you can see and move your hands in VR is not only really cool, it means you can look and see where the buttons are. It also makes games very immersive and gives a surprising feeling of presence.The two cameras allow for room scale (virtually mapping out your play space so you can walk around it) and this works pretty well... it tracks perfectly with the exception of if you have your back to the cameras and your hands are out of view, it struggles.Games and experience are not cheap...although there are a good number of free options (Fantasynth a personal fave). I find I can only spend so long in VR, it's quite intense initially and expect some motion sickness. It also left me feeling very odd days after using it for the first week or two... hard to explain but just not quite ""with it"" and an almost floating feeling. Honestly Google it, I'm not alone, it seems a common thing for new users - just goes to show how powerful VR is.Only other thing to note is that once you've let your friends have a go...they'll never stop asking to play with it!

Avete un pc che abbia le caratteristiche raccomandate per l'oculus? Avete 400 euro che volete spendere per videogiocare in un modo totalmente nuovo? Bene. Acquistate l'Oculus Rift.E la recensione potrebbe tranquillamente fermarsi qui, perchè finchè non lo proverete coi vostri occhi non potrete capire il livello di immersione, coinvolgimento e divertimento che questa periferica potrà regalarvi.Tutte le persone a cui l'ho fatto provare (me compreso) rimangono a bocca aperta la prima volta ed è davvero difficile cercare di spiegare a parole la sensazione che l'oculus genera.In questa recensione vorrei infatti semplicemente rispondere ad alcune domande che io mi sono fatto prima di acquistarlo e che magari ora vi state facendo anche voi:- il tracking com'è?Molto buono coi due sensori in bundle, perfetto con 3. Il terzo sensore potrete comprarlo direttamente sul sito dell'oculus a circa 69 euro.- e la risoluzione dell'immagine?2160X1200 pixel, che sono più di un monitor Full HD. I due schermi dell'Oculus sono molto vicini agli occhi e daranno un lieve effetto sgranato, ma nulla che possa compromettere l'esperienza.- giochi ce ne sono?Tantissimi. Moltissime esperienze brevi per testarlo e farlo testare ad amici e famiglia, e molti giochi completi. La maggior parte di questi ultimi nasce per essere usata esclusivamente con visori e garantiscono un'esperienza veramente diversa da qualsiasi altra cosa a cui eravate abituati.- è difficile da usare?No. Ha imparato ad usarlo mia nonna di 84 anni e si è divertita come una matta.- dopo un po' stufa?A un mese dall'acquisto lo uso ancora quotidianamente.- fa venire nausea/mal di testa/morte istantanea?Molto soggettivo. A me solo pochissimi titoli fanno venire un po' di nausea, ma normalmente lo uso anche per più di un'ora consecutiva senza alcun problema.- ma oltre a giocarci ci si può fare altro?Sì. Gli ambiti applicativi sono davvero tantissimi. Oltre a videogiocare potrete: usare maps VR per scoprire posti in 3d in giro per il mondo e visitarli, disegnare in 3d con alcune delle app di grafica, vedere qualsiasi film come se foste in un cinema (BigScreen), vedere film in 3d come se ci foste dentro, imparare qualcosa di nuovo tramite le numerose app di divulgazione scientifica e non (Body VR ad esempio), conoscere gente nuova attraverso le app social (e giocarci assieme) e potrei continuare.- quanto sono lunghi i vari cavi? Ho bisogno di extender/prolunghe?2.5 metri i cavi USB 3.0 dei sensori, 4.5 metri il cavo del visore.Io ho dovuto usare delle prolunghe per i sensori, ma tutto dipende da come li sistemate nella camera. Se vi dovessero servire comprate pure gli extender usb 3.0 di amazon basics che vanno benissimo e costano poco.- quanto spazio devo avere per potermi muovere e giocare decentemente?Io ho creato uno spazio di circa 3 metri x 2 metri ed è perfetto. Si riesce comunque a giocare anche con meno spazio, tipo 2 metri x 1.5 metri.- che scheda video devo avere? Processore?Io uso una RTX 2070 e viaggio senza problemi. L'ho comunque provato con una gtx 970 e tutti i giochi andavano comunque lisci come l'olio (abbassando ovviamente le impostazioni grafiche). Fate attenzione al processore, io ho un i5 6600k a 4.5 ghz e gira spesso tra l'80% e il 90% di utilizzo, credo che un i7 gestirebbe meglio la VR.In conclusione, come ho scritto all'inizio, è difficile spiegarvi PERCHE' dovreste comprarlo, ma fidatevi, se ne avete la possibilità è davvero un'esperienza unica nel suo genere, e questo è il primo passo per il futuro del videogioco.

I wasn't sure how much difference a 3d sensor would make but after giving a few games a try like In Death, Robo Recall and Superhot VR to name a few and I can honestly say it makes the vr experience so much better,  no more arrows saying face sensor no more lost tracking and you can turn round completely no tracking glitchs its great very pleased definitely recommend a must have for anyone who enjoys vr... .Setting up the sensor wasn't just plug and play you will need to run complete sensor setup and use the 16 foot 2.0 extension cable that comes free with this sensor!!I thought it would work better if I used all 3.0 cables but I kept getting a warning sign and an error message that says bad tracking fatal error and it will not allow you to finish the 360 setup, I tried many different USB 3.0 ports all came up with the same error even after a system reboot and driver updates, after few web searchsI found that 3rd sensor has to use a 2.0 connection, I quess that's why they provide you with a free 2.0 cable lol  :-)...

While the Oculus Rift itself has been great with my brother very impressed with it compared to his PSVR this product relies on the software/games it provides and the service provided around that software. One of the very first game purchases I made through their website was mistakenly for the Oculus Go (which I don't have), I asked to be refunded. I promptly received a reply back saying that they would make an exception just this once and they gave me a refund. I thought that strange that they felt they needed to make an ""exception"".Busy at work on Black Friday an email comes in from them with their deals. I take a quick look not wanting to miss out, click on a link, scroll down reading the game descriptions and buy a couple of package deals. Wanting to get the download going so they would be ready when I finished work, I went to the app to find they weren't there. Yes again, I bought for the Oculus Go by mistake.I immediately emailed Oculus to ask for a refund which they declined as they had already given me a one off ""exception"" despite me not even being able to download or run the games.With a product that is so focused around the software it runs and the service it provides in delivering that software I feel that Oculus has fallen short in their policy.While I can recommend the physical product itself, as an entire package defined by including the service of delivering the software, I cannot recommend the Oculus eco system.

Top quality VR for a good price. Complete with Touch controllers and two sensors. These controllers are very good ergonomically. The sensors are quite versatile in their setup and can cope with awkward shaped rooms (it takes practice). There's even an ""experimental"" setup to get 360 degree tracking using just the two sensors (which works). There are good built-in headphones and mic so no need to wear another headset on top (they are detachable if you want though). Pixel density is only behind that of the HTC Vive ""pro"" version which is about three times the price and has its own cons like weight.The nature of VR at the moment is that your eyes are near to the screen and you will notice pixels if you look hard enough. Just like games played on a monitor, some look a lot better than others and bad anti-aliasing is very noticeable. Some games more than others induce motion sickness, especially if walking using smooth locomotion. There is also a cable to trip over, and you are wearing a mask at the end of the day. I found wearing glasses uncomfortable and ended up getting a Widmovr prescription lens adapter (you can get them with blue light protection). Oculus says frames up to 142mm are ok but I got fed up of using a plaster to relieve  bridge pain :D You only really need glasses if you're short-sighted and objects are too blurry about 2 m away. Remember to blink now and then to lubricate those eyes!What's it like? Well take Steam VR for instance. Instead of looking at a flat dashboard you're in a room that you can furnish and entertain in, etc etc. As far as VR goes, believe the hype. Look behind you using a monitor and you see your wallpaper; look behind in VR and you see another world. In fact you don't just see another world, you're in one. And it's full-sized.

Product recieved and I would love to give this a 5 star review yet I can't as the product just doesn't work. Was working perfectly the first day I recieved the product, set it up and bam in vr. Next thing I knew I was going to be late for work so I unplugged the headset after closing down robo recall and turned off my pc. Next day, wen't to use the headset, hmm whats this, an orange led instead of white. Must just need to open up the oculus app. Nope still orange, hmm let's just google it. First support page, says to make sure connections are fully connected both in the pc and in the HMD done that, still orange, okay next forum, restart your pc, obvious sollution that I missed, still orange, okay next, reinstall oculus app, did that, still orange. Next tip, downgrade graphics driver to a more stable version e.g 388.31 as suggested by many others. Still orange. What next, change hdmi ports and usb 3.0 ports. did that, still nothing, other than when connecting the hdmi to hdmi, it then says, hdmi cable not connected and led still orange. OKay really frustrated now. Contacted support. Obviously not going to hear back from them for a while. Next step, reset pc to defaults and remove everything for a fresh install. Still orange, great waste of time. Next step. Take out all redundant usb devices e.i webcam, headset etc. Still orange. Okay, now im really trying to not throw it at a wall here. Whats next. Nothing, literally nothing other than try using it on someone elses pc. Yes great now that means if it works it's my pc, yet it's not, as it was literally working 12 hours before.

It's great fun experiencing Virtual Reality with an Oculus Rift, but it's more of a 3 days wonder. Then it gets boring. At least it did for me. The reason being that VR is still not there yet. Gamers are having the most fun when playing with their friends. For what they are, these plasticky VR kits are way too overpriced and only accessible to few. If VR is to take off and catch speed, it has to become more affordable. The more people get to experience VR, the faster it'll grow and improve.What you'll first notice when using an Oculus Rift are the annoyingly pixelated graphics. Transitioning from the crisp video quality of your 1440p gaming monitor to Oculus, can be quite upsetting at first, but your brain will get over it and choose to ignore this aspect eventually. I get that this is due to the lens magnifying effect, but it's 2019. It's time to step up your game, Oculus.The second aspect I want to discuss about is that, while objects that appear in the center are pretty well focused, everything becomes blurry towards the edge of the lenses. Then again, you get used to this too, eventually.I like the controllers, though. They're very responsive and ergonomically designed. A nice addition for the future would be GLOVES, instead of controllers. Gloves that will have individual sensors for each finger and also for the palms, so that we can control everything through hand gestures and not buttons on a controller.I also noticed that the video feed stutters hard when I turn my back to the sensor readers, which would normally sit in front of me.For the entertainment and the fun of it, I was willing to overlook the inconveniences and enjoy the experience. There are plenty of apps and games to choose from in the Oculus store or the Steam store, many of them free. However, for the premium VR feeling, you're going to have to dig into your pocket. And it doesn't come cheap.It is, overall, an unique experience, but it feels outdated and can't keep up with the current level of entertainment that PC and Console gaming has to offer. VR feels like the slow kid who's always trying to catch-up with the cool kids, but can't.It's time for improvements to be implemented and it's time for a serious price drop. Else, suffer the same fate of 3D TV's!

This really is a great experience that I fully beleive is  bend new experience thst everyone needs to try. I was skeptical but after playing it for over a month I am happy to say I would recommend if you find there are alot of games you would want to try. I found in all there are just not enough games at the moment and it would probably be worth waiting until more games come out. You spend 400 on a headset and then only a few full length games are out there and you hace to shell out another 40 each for them. Still if you have the money to spare it's  really good product. There really is no other experience quite like being VR

What's nit to like? Well, adding another sensor made my PC complain (so had to plug it in elsewhere) and it is more cables for a slightly better coverage. But really my complaint is more VR general (not even Oculus specific) more string around the place and that makes it harder to justify and use of course - shame.Came with an active USB cable (but I used my own UGreen one).But it works perfectly and is nicely designed so I can't be too hard, put another half star on there for me would you...!

Easily the best VR headset currently available, fantastic build quality, great touch controllers, great audio quality and very comfortable once you've adjusted it right, only negatives are you will want to buy a 3rd sensor for good room scale tracking and the glossy tops of the touch controllers are impossible to keep clean, still better than the Vive in my opinion and cheaper too even with the 3rd sensor.

As a family we clubbed together to buy this for my son’s 18th Birthday, as it was his dream gift.We luckily bought it on Amazon Prime Day and got it at a reduced price. Or it wouldn’t have been possible to get it...thank you Amazon 💛Despite being 18 yrs old, it took me back to when he was a small child opening his gifts. The sheer excitement and delight on his face, melted our hearts.I’ve yet to try it out, but I’ve one extremely happy son.The down side is I will hardly see him lol. At least he’s the 6 weeks holidays to enjoy it daily until college starts again.I can’t wait to try it out, it’s going to be amazing.Arrived next day, well packaged and the box is well designed and sturdy to keep the equipment in longterm. Nice added bonus.Happy days. Thank you

If you are thinking about getting a VR headset, here is my view and some things to consider.If you have tried Google Cardboard or any of the other mobile phone headsets out there and not been impressed, You won't be.They are a not a true representation of ""Proper"" VR.  These types of devices track your head rotation only, there is no ""translation"" awareness, so you cannot move around (Forward, Backwards, Left, Right, Up or Down), you are fixed in position. You are free to ""look around"" only.""Proper VR"" has the ability to let you move around freely within your enthronement in all 6 degrees of movement, the extra ingredient that brings VR to life if the inclusion of your hands in the environment. THis give you the ability to interact naturally with object withing the environment. something a phone device has absolutely no way to provide.Personally I have an Oculus Rift, it has an isolated (zero-crosstalk) stereoscopic display which uses image distortion and fish-eye lenses to achieve an wide field of view. This is a big deal, it adds tremendously to the sense of immersion. You really feel like you are ""inside"" the virtual space, and have an accurate sense of where objects are in relation to you, depth wise. The hand trackers are so perfectly positioned, you do not, (And cannot), see them in the real world when wearing the HMD, but just moving your hand naturally to the position you see in the virtual world, you will be able to pick them up!  That in itself is impressive.The PC needed to power this headset also needs to be fairly substantial and requires a dedicated 3D graphics card, but then any PC game these days worth its salt requires that. the more powerful the better the experience though.  I think the minimum specification GPU is an Nvidia 960, but this will not run the most demanding games at their best graphic ability. I'd recommend a minimum an Nvidia 1080ti for the GPU.The ""Elephant in the room"" : Some experiences WILL make you feel sick. Its something they are working on. Some games have solved it, some haven’t.It all depends on weather the game or experience you are using has was is known a ""free locomotion"" or not. long with the frame-rate the graphics are delivered.Free locomotion allows you to ""glide"" around your environment smoothly just by pushing the hand controller joystick in the direction you wish.This sounds great, but in VR it is very confusing for you brain/vestibular system to correlate their differing inputs and as a result motion sickness can be felt.It does need to be said that this is a ""beginner"" symptom, and with regular ""training"" you will overcome this feeling and gain you ""VR legs"" so to speak!It's not a question of “Does a VR headset actually feel realistic?”.  The only question is if you are ready for such a jump in technology.This is NOT Nintendo Wii 3.0 or XBox X-5 or PS 5! This is NOT an updated console system or fun little gadget. This is something different.Something you have never experienced before. It's another dimension. The future of gaming and home entertainment.For me, its the most amazing thing I’ve ever had the pleasure of being a part of, and cant wait to see where this will go.When I first got it, the only way I could explain it to people was that its just blows your mind and is an absolute game changer in every way.No amount of watching YouTube videos of people using a Rift, or me saying ""it is good"", can't relay the feeling of of actually wearing and being in the headset.I read recently that 2/3 of the population still don’t know that VR even exists or think its just a gimmick and are reluctant to take that step into VR.To that I say, after Mark Zuckerburg was shown the Oculus Rift, he immediately offered $4,000,000,000, (Yes 4 Billion dollars!), to buy the company.Now that is a response!!Regarding the price of getting started with VR, people often say it is ""too expensive"". Depending on your needs, VR is not “too expensive”.If you have a relatively recent generation smartphone (last ~3 years or so), you can buy a Google Cardboard (or similar) adapter for as little as £1For a step up, you can get something like a Google Daydream or Samsung Gear VR. They both still need a smartphone, but they are both under £100.You can get an entry level all-in-one system like an Oculus Go for £200. Still not terribly expensive.Now all three of these systems are entry level, and as with all things in life you largely ""get what you pay for.""For someone that has never experienced VR, all three can deliver something exciting, but it is not ""true"", full immersion VR.Over the £200 price point, things get a little more interesting...You have Playstation VR for about £350, or less if you already have a PS4.After that, you get into things like the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality. Those range from £200 to ~£600, but you need a pretty beefy PC to run them. The total cost is £1200 – £1800, which is starting to be expensive, granted, but not ridiculous. If you have a PC that can be upgraded (you can often just upgrade the graphics card) you’re looking at £500-£800 all in.For this amount of money, you get a top notch immersive VR system that can cover an area as large as 15′ x 15′ (4.5m x 4.5m), which is pretty big.You’ll be free to walk around that entire space within a virtual environment.VR can provide some escapism, exposure to new things, engagement, excitement along with everything else you can get from other media, books to a movie or video game. In my opinion, and according to the growing body of academic research, VR is more immersive than other media. In other words, you can, and will, get more engrossed in what you are doing when in VR.Estimates show about 6 million units have been shipped of higher end systems (PSVR, Vive, Rift, Windows Mixed Reality).At the other end of the spectrum, Google cardboard alone was over 10 million units!That’s comparable to a gaming console like Sega’s Dreamcast, and ahead of Nintendo’s Wii U. And we’re only a couple of years in to VR.Uses for VR at home span the range from educational/practical to pure fun, but many of those uses combine a little of both.On the practical side, there are a variety of things you can do in VR at home:Visit real places around the globe — see VR Travel: 10 Ways To See the World From Your Living RoomVisit real places on other planets — see Mars: Curiosity RoverImmerse yourself in a concert LIVE with NextVRHelp house-bound seniors deal with depression and isolation with Virtual Reality for SeniorsVisit museums with Amazing virtual museum toursExplore a new kitchen with Virtual Reality from IKEAWatch news feeds from around the globe with 360 video.On the fun games and experiences front, whilst there certainly is plenty of ""shovelware"" on Steam (and to a lesser extent Oculus Home), there are plenty of great experiences to be had from both stores.My personal favourite VR games/experiences which have given me many hundreds of hours of fun include:-Skyrim VR, Lone Echo, Arizona Sunshine, Assetto Corsa, Battlezone, Brass Tactics, DCS World, Dead and Buried, Echo Arena, Elite Dangerous, Lucky's Tale,Minecraft, Onward, Project Cars II, Robo Recall, Superhot VR, Willson's Heart, Google Earth VR, Farlands, Sparc.I could go on, but think I'm doing that already :-)I would argue that no gaming system in history has ever had a line-up so involving, exciting and physically jaw dropping at times, and the best is still yet to come :)I have played many games in VR but I have been extremely impressed by the conversion of the Skyrim from Bethesda to VR.Even though these are not perfect conversions, as they were not ""built for VR"" in the first instance, and you will run into bugs or oddities, they nevertheless convey a world you can get completely lost in. I regularly spend 8 or more hours per session, but it feels fleeting!You have a huge world around you that when you play in flat-screen is nice but its like watching a movie, now replaying it in VR it feels strange, almost like a religious experience at times. You stand on the top of a mountain and look out over the land and all its majesty, but its all just code, realistic looking code, you are left with a feeling like you are in the matrix.I am still awed and find myself sat with my mouth open, by the vistas presented in Skyrim (Modded to hilt of course).I am that Barbarian with a hunting bow in hand, crossing Tamriel in search of adventure ;-)All in all, it is the biggest leap forward in home entertainment since the Atari 2600!If you can, buy one, I whole heartedly recommend it, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

The best piece of Tech I have ever bought
"
2022-05-22 17:25:11.461779,"
I bought a GearVR for my phone and tried the games a few times and wasn't really that overwhelmed, yeah it was new but kind of wore off and got bored with it and left it alone but new that it had potential as I've always been into the idea of gaming in virtual reality but it didn't really immerse me the way I wanted it to.I thought I'd give the Oculus Rift a go as I had read many reviews and watched many YouTube videos of people playing it and seeing their reactions to it and gave it a gamble to see if I thought the same and yes a very expensive gamble to make but I'm glad I did.After setting it up which wasn't as simple as I had hoped with the setting up of the sensors giving me the most problem like it talking me I wasn't in the centre or I was too close over and over again I finally got it set up and then a demo started with a flying robot telling giving me floppy disks and to insert them into a disk drive and there I had my first wow moment.As with any hardware it depends on the kind of software you use to get the most out of it so with the Oculus Rift it depends on the games you play, I've tried many and a few seemed like tech demos to see what you could do in VR and then there are games like Lone Echo, Dirt Rally and Skyrim VR which really show that having the right games will really give you your moneys worth as these games were fun to play and gave me the experiences I was looking for and really immersed me into virtual reality.You do need a bit of space though as games I tried like Superhot do intend you to walk around a bit and without enough space you'll find yourself hitting furnature like I did with a chest of drawers but other games you can Judt stand there and have enough room to wave your arms around.One thing I did really like was the guardian system that enables you to walk around your room pressing down the controller button so you can map out how big your room is so if you go past it a kind of cage pops up to warn you if you're close to your boundary which I didn't do before I played Superhot so make sure you do all the set up procedure before starting the Rift as accidents can happen.Now having my Rift I can't understand why more people aren't gaming this way and that more developers aren't making games for it as for me this is the way forward and really hope that more games are to come which will take me away to another dimension to game like I never have before.

I bought this back in July, its now November. I've used the rift for about 40 hours total in that time and when not in use it is stored tidily.With even this limited use and being well looked after the headset cable has managed to kink at the point it leaves the headset via a small hard plastic clip. Not so bad i thought, i will order a new cable... how much could it be... £50 pounds it could be. Not ordering a new cable at that price and i would highly recommend not buying this product until they either fix the design flaw, package it with better cables or sell replacement cables at a more sane price.

...A new fantastic point of view.Literally, though.  From the moment you put on the headset and enter the demo game (Contact) there is an undeniable ""wow!"" feeling.  There are lots of free mini games that the kids love (Toybox, Waltz of the Wizard etc.) and proper AAA titles like Skyrim VR.  Who wouldn't want to explore the world of Skyrim with a sword in one hand and shooting fireballs from the other?  The fact that you are actually swinging the sword and aiming the fireballs adds a whole new dimension.This isn't the complete VR experience yet (we need tactile bodysuits still) but for the price it is the best you'll get right now.

After developing tracking issues a few months after receiving this, I contacted Oculus who were utterly useless at helping - telling me to go through all the common procedures found on their forums which I had already taken the time to try. After Oculus wasting my time they informed me I would have to collect an invoice from the 3rd party seller on Amazon - Electronic zone Wholesale Ltd - it would be fair to say they f*****d me, completely ignored all emails, ignored emails from Amazon directly and never provided any invoice or receipt, a task which would take little effort and time.Amazon, Oculus and Electronic zone Wholesale Ltd have not shown a single ounce of courtesy or respect, I will not be doing business with Oculus or Electronic zone Wholesale Ltd again and I will not be relying on Amazon for customer service in future.

Bonjours, ça va faire une semaine que je suis en galère à cause de la gâchette de mon Touch droit qui reste bloqué assez souvent ce qui est extrêmement gênant pour tous les types de logiciels/jeux. (Mais bon, première ça arrive...)Je fais donc un retour chez Amazon, que le site me confirme.Deux minute plus tard je reçois un coup de fil pour Amazon qui me dit de contacter par mail Oculus. (C'est pourtant Amazon qui m'a vendu la chose non?)Je contact donc via le mail donné le support Oculus, pas de réponse, je décide donc d'aller sur le site.Sur leur site, ils me demandent de leur envoyer une vidéo du problème... Bon, ok, je tourne le tout sur mon portable et j'envoi le tout sur leur support... Mais le fichier est trop volumineux... Une vidéo d'à peine une minute.Je leur demande donc qu'on se balance ça via mail. (Et en plus il faut penser à partager avec l'interlocuteur la vidéo via W10 et Google Mail...)Pour eux ils ne voient pas le problème, obligé de leur rebalancer deux vidéo hier, j’attends toujours une réponse de la part d'Oculus.Ça fait une semaine que je galère pour me faire remplacer un produit défectueux entre deux boîtes qui se renvoient la patate chaude, ça commence à bien faire, j'en ai ma claque!REMPLACEZ-MOI CE TOUCH QU'ON EN PARLE PLUS!Il m'aura fallu une semaine pour pouvoir me le remplacer, enfin.Sinon emballage nickel reçu dans les temps annoncés, pour une première expérience, sans tenir compte du SAV c'était franchement génial, le design des Touch sont vraiment bine fait (Par contre faites un effort pour la qualité par pitié.), et malgré la pixellisation on est tellement dedans qu'on parviens presque à oublier ce qu'il y a autour de nous.La boîte est toute belle, le poids de la bête est très correct.La bonne idée qui dois rester sur des casques VR, c'est le système de branchement des écouteur, qu'on peux enlever avec un tour de vis, ça, c'était bien vu, par contre pas de micro, donc de facto le casque est totalement inutile (Pour moi.), même si pas mauvais du tout.Qualité où défaut à vous de voir, ayant une petite tête, il me suffit de regarder en bas pour voir en dehors du casque, ce que je trouve assez pratique.Défaut pour moi, j'ai découvert cette merveille en août et outre le fait de transpirer dedans, les lentilles ont tendance à s'embuer assez rapidement surtout sur Robo Recall (Bon défouloir au passage.^^).Dommage par contre qu'on ne puisse pas se balader dans les environnements d’accueil du rift, mais le Steam VR le fait bien.Conclusion: La VR DOIT se démocratiser, c'est vraiment un support génial, les défaut de conception du début finiront par être gommés, par contre améliorez votre organisation de vos SAV Amazon et Oculus, ça vous fera pas de mal.Allez je rajoute deux autres étoiles pour soutenir le support.

Using this with my Oculus Rift Touch, it came with 2 tracking sensors, but I found that to get perfect 360-degree racking, a third sensor places behind me allowed for much better tracking. When setting up 3 sensors it can take a little bit of time to get it all set up in such a way that the Oculus software is happy with it. You also have to be careful what type of USB extension you are using and the ports you are plugging into, but once it is all set up it provides a great VR experience.

I got exactly what I expected, one of the best high end virtual reality headsets currently on the market with by far the best controllers currently available. This bundle contains everything needed to play almost any virtual reality games and although the tracking may cut out at very specific areas because there are only two sensors included in the package, I think it is one of if not the best VR packages out there. The set up part is very easy to do and rarely needs to be re-calibrated.Things of note:beware, you will need to buy a fair amount of games because most of the current games are pretty short, I would recommend buying the VR essentials bundle from steam and Elite Dangerous if you have a joystick available.Another thing to note is that you will need a good computer for this to work without getting VR-sickness after longer play sessions, I can play for hours on end with my high end computer but with lower frame rates this gets harder to do as I noticed when I brought this over to one of my friends and everyone there got a little sick with only about 30 minutes of playing.Yet another thing to note is that the cables on the headset are VERY short and if you intend on having your computer stationary as you play you will pretty much have to buy an extension cable for the HDMI and USB cable don't skimp on these cables either as that might have an influence on your experience.

If you are on the fence about getting this, just get it. Its incredible! as soon as you load it up youll know where that money went and youll forget all about the price tag. Really simple to setup, controls are intuitive (its just the same as opening and closing your hand) and very comfortable. Just dont loose track of time when your in there, it can get a bit disorenting to realise you were in another world for an hour!

It's an event.The Oculus works great and the Touch controllers are soooooo comfortable. Even on my very modest PC everything plays great. I don't play it much but I would still consider it a worthy purchase, it doesn't feel like a normal game, it's more akin to an arcade game from my childhood, the best fun you can have standing up.PS the porn is dope.

Was dubious of VR in the beginning, I though it'd be like 3D.. a fad.  But after playing on the PS4 VR kit I knew I wanted one. I don't have a PS4 but my PC is more than capable and so I opted for the Oculus over the Vive. It's been great fun, the games that come with it are superb mix of what's available, I play Elite Dangerous with it and it's almost as if I'm there in space. The best experience though might be the free Google Earth app that let's you browse the globe as if you're some vast space giant staring down at the planet.

I always wanted to tryout VR but put off with the huge costs. This tech is now a complete bargain if you have a decent PC to run it. It takes a little time to setup and you need decent space to fully use it. If you do, you won't be disappointed. It blows away expectations, the head tracking is flawless, controllers integrate perfectly also with perfect tracking. only if you move them behind your back will you momentarily lose tracking. Incredible experience, now at an affordable price.

It's great for depth perception, and head tracking. But lackluster everywhere else; the resolution NEEDS to increase two fold at least, as the scceen is very blurry, especially in games that involve large distances and high quality textures.Field of View needs a major improvement, once i got used to the ""immersion"", i began feeling like i'm looking down a 2cm hole at the eyes. which prompted a rot of head movement.

The Rift itself is awesome.

There are very few decent games to make £400 seem worth it.

Immersive 3D, sound and control that pushes you into VR in really strong way. The controls are easy-hand fit, the sound is cool and the Oculus it self is really nice. Minor settings like fogging, lens adjusting and the low Hz/FPS in some applications don't show the fully of this. A warning, some experiences provides seasick/nausea so, go with calm, slow down and get used to it and that will be past.

Me había tardado en comprarlo gracias al precio, que usaba un control de Xbox, no tenia una PC que lo corriera con facilidad, etc. Ahora que bajó de precio, hay mejor disponibilidad en México, sustituyeron el control de Xbox con los “Touch Controllers” e incluyen muchos juegos, sentí que subió la relación precio/beneficio y decidí comprarlo. Estoy más que impresionado.Lo bueno:- El efecto “screen door” si es aparente, pero solamente cuando se están cargando los juegos y no estas jugando, después ni te das cuenta de que existe.- Funciona muy bien con 2 sensores y perfecto con 3, especialmente en cuartos grandes.- Los “Touch Controllers” son fenomenales, son los mejores controles que he usado en mi vida.- El nivel de inmersión de mover la mano y agarrar una pistola, dar la vuelta, apuntar hacia un robot y dispararle es algo fuera de lo real.- El visor es de muy alta calidad y muy ligero, todo se ve increíble. 360 grados en 3D, es el futuro.Lo malo:- Está conectado por cable, esto reduce un poco la inmersión.- Se calienta un poco y puedes sudar un poco, el material del visor se puede humedecer y no es muy cómodo.- Al ser tecnología de primera generación no hay tantos juegos que aprovechen bien el estar en VR. Cada vez hay más.Todo se resume en la primera vez que lancé mi mano a mis hombros buscando una escopeta para matar al robot que se aceraba a mi mientras jugaba Robo Recall. Solté un grito de emoción y no conozco a nadie que al hacer lo mismo no quede totalmente impresionado. Cómpralo, úsalo y nunca mires atrás!

The headset itself is really fun but the Oculus specific hdmi cable that runs it can get broken easily. I've been trying to get one as a spare just incase anything happens but people are reporting that Oculus have now discontinued these and so they are really hard to source. So, if yours breaks.. you own a £400 paperweight!

It's OK. Poor resolution to be truly immersive, bulky wires make turning 360* a pain and with only 2 sensors your calibration will mess up (needs 3 to cover all angles) Good quality audio from built in speakers. Fair product for the price but nothing mind blowing.

Having used both the Rift and the Vive, I have found that the Oculus is much lighter and more comfortable to wear. The touch controls are much more natural to use. If you set the sensors up in opposite corners, or add another to make 3. Room scale VR is no issue.

Ciao a tutti, dopo circa un mese di utilizzo di Oculus Rift mi sento obbligato a dover lasciare una mia recensione e una mia opinione generale sul prodotto. Saltando la parte dell'imballaggio ottimo come al solito, partiamo direttamente dal visore in sé.Oculus Rift permette all'utente di entrare in un mondo virtuale e di provare emozioni veramente grandi. Il visore è veramente ben costruito, unica nota particolare sulla costruzione di esso è il posizionamento in testa. È molto leggero ed ergonomico (quasi non si sente), ma per vedere al meglio e senza sfocature bisogna fare un buon settaggio delle regolazioni. Mi riferisco a tutti quelli che si sono lamentati dicendo di vedere sfocato eccetera, è tutta una questione di regolazione del visore. Assicuratevi di allargare tutti gli strappi prima di indossarlo, solo dopo averlo fatto indossatelo e muovetelo su e giù, destra e sinistra davanti agli occhi finché non avrete la migliore visione possibile, chiudere poi gli strappi. Tracking perfetto, performance molto buone anche su PC discreti (1050ti). Consigliato per vrchat.Reputo questo visore attualmente il migliore avendo anche provato htc vive e Windows mixed reality. giá solo per il fatto che Oculus ti permette di muovere le dita per dare comandi (e il suo prezzo onestissimo) fa capire chi comanderà il mercato VR nei prossimi anni.

Anfangs war ich skeptisch mir überhaupt schon VR zuzulegen. Ich wurde jedoch eines besseren belehrt. Mit VR eröffnet sich eine vollständig neue Spielweise. Sehr unterhaltsam allerdings ein Zeitkiller 😅Die Auflösung lässt in dieser Generation zwar Wünsche offen aber nach einiger Zeit fällt das kaum noch auf. Sobald Prozessoren und Grafikkarten nachziehen denke ich, dass kommende Generationen von VR Systemen durch die höhere Detailtiefe nur gewinnen werden. Zur Zeit spiele ich mit meiner GTX 1060 3GB und meinem i7 7700, dem 16 GB Arbeitsspeicher zu Seite stehen Elite Dangerous in Ultra Settings und kann mich nicht beklagen.Das Tracking funktioniert auch mit zwei Sensoren in 360° Setup ziemlich gut, allerdings sollte man bedenken genügend Kabel bzw aktive Hubs zu besorgen wenn man eine genügend große Spielzone aufbauen will. Unter Umständen ist hier ein dritter Sensor sehr sinnvoll. Falls ihr sowohl im Sitzen als auch im Stehen in die VR wollt, müsst ihr entweder probieren wo ihr die beiden Sensoren am Besten positioniert oder euch einen Dritten zulegen. Entsprechende Tutorials gibt's im Internet bzw. bei YouTube zu Hauf.Man sollte unbedingt darauf achten ausreichend viele USB 3.0 Steckplätze (root hubs) an seinem Rechner verfügbar zu haben (einen je Sensor und einen weiteren für die Oculus selbst). Eine Erweiterungskarte für PCI Express ist hier, je nach Mainboard-Ausstattung, zu empfehlen.Wandhalterungen für die Sensoren empfehle ich sehr.Falls eure Spielzone entsprechend groß ist, solltet ihr auch in Verlängerungen für das Kabel der Oculus investieren (USB und HDMI). Achtet hier auf gute Qualität, gerade bei HDMI Verlängerungen geht viel Datenrate aufgrund von schlechten Rohstoffen des Kabels verloren. Sucht nach Testberichten von vertrauenswürdigen Quellen. Manches ist einfach schlichtweg Wucher.Ansonsten bietet das bundle interessante Spiele damit ihr einmal testen könnt, wie euch VR gefällt. Ich bin jedenfalls begeistert.Eins noch: Wenn ihr verhindern wollt, dass eure Kabel euch im Weg sind, besorgt euch eine Kabelführung zur Deckenmontage.Kabelmanagement: https://www.amazon.de/dp/B06XFMY8G9/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_9NFwBbA565BE4Wandhalterungen: https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0782RYF81/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_QPFwBbE7DABE4

I was really on the fence with VR for such a long time, I finally bit the bullet and ordered a Rift. No regrets what so ever! This thing is really well made and feels top notch ( what I would expect from a $600 piece of hardware ). The controllers are comfortable and fit in the hands nicely. Honestly I have no complaints about the headset at all, sadly though the games library still isnt there just yet but that has nothing to do with the headset itself. Cant recommend the enough if you are looking to give VR a go

It's a must have gadget for any gamer. Just remember you should have GTX 1050 or more graphics card and recommended configuration of PC.. I had GTX 960 , which is below minimum requirement, so I had a low frame rate , which can cause a dizziness and motion sickness to the user. So better use high configuration hardware.Build quality and feel of Oculus Rift is premium.Overall I am happy with this product.

Al principio creía que no daría buena calidad de sonido, pero me equivoque. Los Touch están ergonómicamente pensados para cualquier mano, y los botones están bien distribuidos. La única pega que se le puede poner sin dos cosas, la resolución, y la interfaz que tiene el visor, que es de esponja, pero eso recurriendo a las vrcover se soluciona. Y la resolución, es que, al utilizarlo en juegos preparados para monitor, hay letras que sin difíciles de leer. Y en otros casos, es óptima.

Das beste Spielzeug, das ich je hatte! Gott sei dank bin ich offenbar nicht mit der berüchtigten VR-Reisekrankheit geschlagen, am ersten Tag war mir nach schnellen Bewegungen kurz etwas schwindelig, aber schon am zweiten Tag fühlte ich mich in der virtuellen Welt sehr zu Hause. Ich muss dennoch etwa alle Stunde eine Pause einlegen, erstens weil die Brille bei Schweißausbruch zum Beschlagen neigt, vor allem aber ist das Spielgefühl sehr immersiv. Alles fühlt sich so echt an, dass ich einfach eine Pause brauche!Natürlich könnte die Auflösung noch besser sein (und das Headset noch leichter und billiger und und und...), aber zusammenfassend kann ich sagen, dass ich kein 2D-Computerspiel mehr angerührt habe, seit ich die Oculus Rift mein Eigen nenne. Für alle Simulations- und Ego-Shooter-Spieler, die das Geld und vier Quadratmeter Platz haben und die sich immer schon gewünscht haben ""mitten drin, statt nur dabei"" zu sein, muss ich die Kaufempfehlung dringend aussprechen. Der einzige Nachteil ist die immer noch recht übersichtliche Auswahl an Spielen, aber ich habe für mich drei - vier Titel gefunden, welche meine Zocker-Träume haben wahr werden lassen.Vorteile:1. Immersives Spielen wie noch nie. Der gefühlte Unterschied zum Spielen ohne VR-Headset ist kaum in Worte zu fassen.2. Flüssiges Tracking, ausgereifte Technik sorgt für intuitives Raumgefühl, 3D-Sehen ""wie in echt"".Nachteile:1. Nicht ganz billig2. Man benötigt etwas Raum3. Der Aufbau der Sensoren kann sich kompliziert gestalten, bis das System mal zu Frieden ist.4. Für manche Menschen auf Grund von Reisekrankheit (""VR-Sickness"") wohl ungeeignet.

Also Preis ist war ordendlich aber immer noch billiger als die HTC vive. Die auflösung ist auch um einiges besser deswegen haben ich mit auch mich für die rift entschieden.Positives: - Das ingame gefühl ist wirklich cool und macht auch extrem spass  - Die touch Controller funktionieren gut und gibt noch das gewisse etwasNegatives: ( Zu beachten ist das das Positive viel stärker ist )  - Nach einer gewissen zeit wird mir übel ( ist bei jeden anders und man gewöhnt sich langsam daran )  - was schlechter entgegensatz zur vive ist die Verbindung vom sensor zum Controller( hinter dem körper verliert er die verbindung.Fazit : wer keine achtenbahnen ( reallive) verträgt sollte sich das gelt sparen ) und wer genug geld hat kann sich das auf jedenfall leisten, bin immer noch zurfieden nach 8 Monate gebrauch und würde es für etwas geld weiterempfehlen

La primera vez es brutal la experiencia e inmersion, no lo boy a negar,cada juego que vas probando te sorprende mas y mas,pero eso se termina a los dias de uso,despues de probar los juegos gratuitos no te quedara de otra que comprar los juegos mas populares de oculus,y creeme no son nada baratos entre 20 y 40 dolares,tu decides.Despues de una semana de uso te acostumbras a la experiencia,y llegas al punto de aburrirte con ellas,ya que la jugabilidad en cada juego casi siempre es la misma,el visor suele calentarse muy poco,pero es suficiente para hacerte sudar tras unos minutos de juego,tendras que limpiar las esponjas y lentes cada vez que los utilizes de nuevo y es algo tedioso,los controles tienen un fallo muy conocido entre la comunidad VR,y es que el gatillo pierde suavidad despues de los dias de uso,y se escucha un click algo molesto al presionar,recuerda que son controles de 200 dolares y eso no tendria que pasar,tu decides.Por la inmersion que ofrece vale la pena,sin embargo ten en cuenta todo lo anterior ya que te vas a topar con ello,tu decides

Heut kam sie an, die Oculus Rift. Nach einen 4,4 GB Download der Software ging es los mit dem Einrichten der ""Anlage"". Dies gestaltete sich einfacher als befürchtet.  Man wird Schritt für Schritt durch das Setup geführt ohne das ich mich überfordert fühlte als VR Neuling. Vor allem ging es ziemlich fix. Danach startete die erste VR Erfahrung mit dem Titel ""First Contact"". Tja was soll ich sagen... sehr beeindruckend.  Will da nicht zu viel verraten. Ab der ersten Sekunde war ich überzeugt von der Technik. Die Bedienung empfinde ich als leicht zu lernen und intuitiv.  Habe jetzt ca 1 1/2 Stunden mal alles probiert (die kostenlosen Spiele downloaden leider noch) und mir ist ein bisschen schlecht. Puh... Das wäre auch der einzige negative Punkt bis jetzt.  Ok... und ich hab ne bessere Grafikkarte gekauft.  Mal schauen ob es einen merklichen Unterschied gibt. Hatte bis jetzt eine GeForce GTX 780 ti mit 3GB und ersetze diese durch eine 1060 mit 6GB. Ich berichte dann mal die nächsten Tage.Update: Also die neue Graka hat jetzt nicht wirklich spürbar etwas verbessert.Positiv ist allerdings nach mehrmaligem Nutzen der Rift das Schwindelgefühl/leichte Übelkeit verschwindet. Ich kann locker mal 2 Stunden zocken ohne ""Nebenwirkungen"".

Lo consiglio vivamente a chiunque sia appassionato di videogiochi, e che vuole giocare a qualcosa di nuovo ed esclusivo.Il rapporto qualità prezzo, l'oculus rift è decisamente imbattibile rispetto agli altri. La prima esperienza è stata fantastica, la prima sessione di gioco era assolutamente entusiasmante; poi però come qualsiasi altra cosa diventa sempre meno entusiasmante, è naturale. Io personalmente l'ho amato e lo consiglio. Vi farete una sessione di gioco da un paio di ore ogni 3 o 4 giorni, ne vale la pena!Ovviamente ci sono anche i contro, le lenti si appannano molto spesso, soprattutto quando si fanno giochi in cui bisogna essere veloci. La visione a zanzariera di cui tutti parlano è quasi impercettibile, bisogna davvero farci caso di proposito per notarla. Una cosa importantissima che dovete sapere è EVITATE I giochi in cui si cammina o in cui si è trasportati da una macchina o un apparecchio come le montagne russe, a me personalmente ha causato una forte nausea in meno di 10 minuti di gioco, e mi sono dovuto sdraiare al letto per un paio di ore. Ho il motion sickness con  tutti i giochi in cui la telecamera non è spostata dal mio corpo ma da un comando del joypad, per fortuna la maggior parte dei giochi li fanno con spostamento a teletrasporto, altrimenti non sarei riuscito ad usare il VR.A parte questo, ci sono molti giochi gratuiti, tra cui Robo Recall che è bellissimo, e altri che ne vale la pena giocare.Io sono rimasto soddisfatto!

Nachdem das selbsterklärende Setup der Sensoren abgeschlossen ist, kann es auch schon mit der ersten Einführung los gehen. Wow! Einfach atemberaubend! Die Nutzung der Touchcontroller geht sehr leicht von der Hand, nachdem man die Gesten erst einmal verinnerlicht hat.Auch das Spiel RoboRecall macht sehr viel spaß, bevor es anfängt monoton zu werden.Nun zu anderen Spielen.Für mich war Elite Dangerous (ein Game, das von Grund auf mit für VR entwickelt wurde) der Haupt Kaufgrund der Rift.Auch hier war das Spielgefühl erst absolut überwältigend! Insbesondere mit einem HOTAS-System hat man eine nie dagewesene Immersion im Spiel. Man fühlt sich, als sitze man tatsächlich im Raumschiff. Einen guten Beitrag leisten auch die Lautsprecher der Rift, die trotz ihrer geringen Größe einen außerordentlich guten Sound abliefern.Schnell stellt man allerdings auch fest, wo die Probleme der Rift (bzw. aller aktuellen VR-Headsets) liegen. Die Auflösung ist einfach noch nicht hoch genug!Feinere Texte sind unscharf, bzw. muss man mit dem Kopf ""näher ran"", damit die Texte größere und entsprechend besser lesbar werden.In einem Spiel wie Elite Dangerous ist zudem der Kontrast ein riesen Problem. Es gibt viele helle Elemente auf dunkeln Hintergründen. Da zwischen Bildschirm und Auge eine Fresnel-Linse liegt, treten hier starke Reflexionen auf (lt. Tests soll dieses Problem bei der HTC Vive geringer auftreten, dafür ist die Schärfe dort ein noch deutlicheres Problem).In dem angesprochenen RoboRecall gibt es eine durchweg homogenere Helligkeit, daher fallen die Reflektionen hier kaum auf.Meine Bedenken bezüglich der Leistungsfähigkeit meines PCs (Intel Xeon 1230v3, 16 GB DDR3, GTX 970) lösten sich schnell in Rauch auf. Alles, was ich angespielt habe, lief butterweich. Zwar teils nur in geringen bis mittleren Grafikeinstellungen, das ist aber fast schon nebensächlich, da man in der VR weniger darauf achtet bzw. z.B. schlechter auflösende Texturen durch den Fliegengittereffekt einfach nicht so stark ins Gewicht fallen.Als Brillenträger ist die Rift ungeeignet! Die Brille passt zwar unter die Rift, allerdings drückt sie unangenehm auf den Nasenrücken und die Rift sitzt nicht mehr so gut und wackelt bei Kopfbewegungen stärker.Ich habe daher immer Kontaktlinsen genutzt.Persönlich habe ich aufgrund der besagten Reflektionen in Verbindung mit schlecht lesbaren Texten die Rift wieder abgegeben.Ich bin allerdings auf die nächsten Generationen und Weiterentwicklungen gespannt.

Avendo acquistato il suo rivale  HTC VIVE. che dopo 2 mesi incominciava a darmi problemi .. fino a chiedere il reso x un bag sul display che non si riusciva a togliere .. oltre ad essere molto pesante e nonostante fosse collegato a un 1080ti -11gb v-ram la qualità erano veramente fastidiose.. poi tutto un botto ho comprato Oculus rift  molto + economico leggero affidabile le immagini sono+ chiare niente sfocature veramente perfeto  superiore al HTC VIVE in tutti i sensi.. per i giochi non abbiate timore  la compatibilità è garantita.  Un altra nota favorevole sono i controller alla quale potete inserire delle batterie e in se per se sono molto comodi e leggeri . Il secondo oculus rift è attualmente colegata su una macchina non molto prestante parliamo di un i5  a 3.9 con 16 gb di ram a 2.4 con una gpu 8gb rx devo dire che va benissimo nonostante il pc sia di fascia media .

Ich habe lange überlegt ob ich mir eine VR Brille kaufen soll, habe es in diesem Fall jedoch nicht bereut! Die Brille ist genial, lässt sich gut an den Kopf anpassen und ist auch nicht all zu schwer. Man sollte sich etwas spielen mit den Einstellungen des Headsets, je besser man die Brille auf die Augen einstellt desto besser das 3D Erlebnis. Die Gratis Spiele auf der Oculus Seite reichen für einige Stunden an Spielspaß!Einziges Manko für mich ist, dass die Kabel der Sensoren sowie der Brille etwas zu kurz sind, könnten ruhig noch nen guten Meter länger sein.

Inizialmente avevo dato 2 stelle perché mi ero basato sulla mia esperienza personale ma il prodotto merita cmq 4 stelle perche di per se è perfetto e non presenta difetti. E poi amazon ha una attenzione al cliente eccezionale! La confezione è stata ben imballata es il pakeging è ottimo. Ma ora parlo della mia esperienza che ripero è personale. Ho acquistato questo prodotto con tutta la buona volontà di tenerlo per un bel po prima di cambiarlo con la prossima generazione ma... niente da fare. fin da subito ho avuto difficoltà di posizionamento e di messa a fuoco ed ho notato i fastidiosissimi God Ray che danno un fastidio cane soprattutto nelle scene ad alto contrasto. scordatevi di usarlo in modalità desktop perché vi fondete le pupille cercando di leggere i testi che risultano sfocati per l'effetto zanzariera. Visione ottimale solo al centro e quando dico centro dico centro perfetto perché più sposti gli occhi per guardale ai lati più si intensificano le aberrazioni cromatiche che sono brutte da vedere ed alterano le immagini in modo non accettabile. Quindi sei costretto a mantenere lo sguardo al centro e spostarti con la testa per guardare qualunque cosa e la cosa può stancare. L'effetto wow c'è ma solo all'inizio e dipende molto dai titoli. Se quardi le cose ""lontane"" ovviamente appaiono sfocate e poco definite e questo è a stretto contatto con la risoluzione che non è abbastanza per rendere l'esperienza ""vera"" e ti sembra tutto sempre poco dettagliato e quindi la realtà ne risente...insomma per tutti questi motivi ritengo che cadano bene per chi non ha l'occhio allenato e quindi per un giocatore occasionale, se invece siete dei giocatori con esperienza o dei grafici con l'occhio sensibile a risoluzione e realismo lasciate perdere e attendete la prossima generazione puntando su dispositivi con risoluzioni maggiori. Ritengo di non acquistare più cuffie virtuali che non abbiano almeno 8k di risoluzione, ovviamente la scheda video deve essere adeguatamente potente e si parla di RX 2080 altrimenti non se ne fa nulla. Il sistema touch è perfetto e difficilmente sbaglia un colpo... molto ergonomici e migliori della controparte HTC VIVE. Spero che questa recensione possa essere utile a qualcuno che pensa di acquistarli e che si attende il prodotto definitivo per la realtà virtuale... il mio consiglio è di attendere ancora un po... restituiti ad Amazon, che come sempre è ineccepibile, in attesa della prossima generazione.

Wanting to take my first steps in VR I decided to purchase the Oculus Rift. The convenience of the bundle and the price tag were the main reasons to choose this instead of HTC products.I bought the Oculus to experiment with VR ArchViz and flight simulation. Being a seasoned IT professional, nowadays little or nothing is capable of amazing myself. The VR experience blew me away. The potential of the technology is endless, both for professional and recreational use (including games).I tried the Oculus Rift with IL 2 Battle of Stalingrad and the sense of immersion was breathtaking, and vomit inducing too :)Google Earth VR is pretty amazing too just to name a couple .

VR ist definitiv nicht für jeden was. Und ein entscheidender Punkt, weshalb das so ist, ist der Preis. Das muss einem klar bewusst sein. Die Rift an sich ist relativ teuer und dann braucht man zusätzlich dazu noch einen leistungsstarken Rechner, da VR Anwendungen immer mehr Rechenleistung benötigen als vergleichbare nicht-VR Anwendungen.Wenn einem das klar ist, und man das in kauf nimmt, hat man mit der VR ein meiner Meinung nach sehr beeindruckendes Erlebnis, was man garnicht so richtig mit anderen Spielen vergleichen kann.Erstmal zum Gerät an sich:Ich hatte bisher mehrere Cardboard VR-Brillen auf (Handy-VR), die HTC-VIVE und eben auch die Rift. Von denen hat mir die Rift mit abstand am besten gefallen. Zum einen weil Handy-VR halt irgendwie nix halbes und nix ganzes ist, aber auch im Vergleich mit der VIVE gefällt mir die Rift besser, zum einen ist der Preis deutlich besser. Außerdem fühlen sich meiner Meinung nach die Controller einfach besser an, auch wenn die Form erstmal gewöhnungsbedürftig ist. Aber auch vom reinen Tragekomfort, die Rift ist gefühlt deutlich leichter als die VIVE, was gerade wenn man vor hat, mehr als ne Stunde zu spielen doch ziemlich wichtig wird. Was die Bildschirme und die Trackingqualität angeht ist mir kein gravierender Unterschied aufgefallen. Ich hab allerdings nur die normale VIVE und nicht die VIVE Pro getestet.Was das Tracking angeht ist wohl die VIVE vorne, da sie einen größeren Spielbereich abdecken kann.Ansonsten wirkt alles solide und stabil. Die Controller sind auch schon das eine oder andere mal aus der Hand gefallen und auf dem Boden gelandet, haben dabei aber keinen schaden genommen.Software und Einrichtung:Das war der meiner Meinung nach nervigste Teil. Ich musste ein bisschen Geduld aufbringen beim installieren der Oculus Software und auch das einrichten war ein wenig friemelig.Teilweise wurde ohne erkennbaren Grund einer der Sensoren nicht richtig erkannt, weshalb das Setup nicht fortgesetzt werden konnte. Also hin und herprobieren, USB Stecker hin und her wechseln bis es irgendwann funktioniert hat.Ich habe alles an USB 3.0 Ports angeschlossen, die Sensoren werden allerdings teilweise trotzdem nur als USB 2.0 erkannt. Keine Ahnung, woran das liegt, scheint aber keinen erkennbaren negativen Nebeneffekt zu haben.Auch das einrichten des Spielbereiches war ein bisschen nervig, da man sehr oft milimeterweise die Positionen der Sensoren nachjustieren muss und jedes mal kurz warten, dass alles erkannt wurde.Das VR Erlebnis:Je nach Spiel variiert das ganze natürlich und ist mal mehr und mal weniger immersiv.Das Reine umsehen in der VR ist schonmal ein Erlebnis für sich. Wer das nicht kennt und eine ungefähre Vorstellung davon haben will kann sich ja mal mit Google Cardboard vertraut machen, dazu muss man nicht so viel Geld ausgeben.Die Touchgesten und das Greifen hat man schnell verinnerlicht und sie werden zu einem natürlichen Ablauf, sodass sich das interagieren mit der Virtuellen Welt sehr natürlich anfühlt.Das bewegen ist leider jedoch mit Hindernissen verbunden. Es gibt im Wesentlichen drei Arten, sich in der VR zu bewegen. Das eine, und auch das, was sich am besten anfühlt ist das bewegen innerhalb des Spielbereichs. Das ist der Bereich, den man vorher eingerichtet hat, der unterschiedlich groß ausfallen kann, was dann aber wiederum an die Fläche gebunden ist, die man tatsächlich in dem Raum zur Verfügung hat. Wenn das Zimmer also sehr vollgestellt ist, oder Möbel im weg sind, fällt dieser entsprechend klein aus. Innerhalb dieses Bereiches ist dafür aber ein uneingeschränktes Bewegen möglich.Die zweite Möglichkeit, die im ersten Moment sehr unnatürlich wirkt und die Immersion ein gutes Stück abschwächt ist das Teleportieren in der VR. In vielen Spielen ist es möglich, sich mit Druck auf eine der Tasten auf dem Controller einen Bereich vor sich auszuwählen, zu dem man dann teleportiert wird. Das ist ein Kompromiss, den man halt leider eingehen muss. Die dritte Möglichkeit ist das Laufen innerhalb der VR mir den Analogsticks. Mein erster Gedanke war, dass das doch viel besser sein muss als das Teleportieren. Ist aber nicht so. Dadurch dass du die Controller als Hände und die Rift selbst als Augen bzw. Kopf benutzt möchtest du auch deine Beine zum laufen benutzen. Jetzt mit dem Analogstick zu laufen sendet deinem Körper widersprüchliche Signale, was bei mir schon nach wenigen Minuten zu derart heftiger Motion Sickness führt, dass ich aufhören muss zu spielen. Es fühlt sich einfach richtig ekelhaft schwindelerregend an, sich so durch die VR zu bewegen. Aber ich schätze das ist auch Geschmackssache. Gewöhnen kann bzw will ich mich daran allerdings nicht, das ist mir die Übelkeit nicht wert.Man muss aber sagen, dass die meisten Spiele, die ich gespielt habe das ganz gut gelöst haben mit einer kombination aus dem freien Bewegen im Spielbereich und Teleportation.Lieferumfang:Die Rift kommt mit den beiden Controllern und zwei Sensoren für das Tracking, sowie einem kleinen Werkzeug mit dem die Kopfhörer abgenommen werden können.Was hier ein bisschen schade ist, ist dass die Kabel meiner Meinung nach recht kurz ausfallen. Ich habe mir zusätzlich noch ein USB 3.0 Verlängerungskabel, einen USB 3.0 Hub und ein HDMI Verlängerungskabel kaufen müssen damit alles funktionierte.Sonstiges:Leider ist VR noch nicht so verbreitet, weshalb es auch eine überschaubare Menge an Spielen gibt, die dann auch noch häufig recht teuer ausfallen.Außerdem muss man damit rechnen, dass man evtl bei den ersten 2-3 Sessions in der VR eine mehr oder weniger starke Übelkeit empfindet und sich erstmal daran gewöhnen muss. Sobald man sich allerdings dran gewöhnt hat kommt das eigentlich nicht mehr vor.Scheinbar gibt es ein Paar Probleme für Brillenträger, die ich persönlich aber nicht so ganz nachvollziehen kann. Die meisten Brillen passen nicht unter die Rift, man muss sie also absetzen. Einige meiner Freunde, die die Rift benutzt haben und Brillenträger sind haben sich beschwert, dass sie teilweise sehr unscharf sehen. Ich bin selbst auch Brillenträger und hab keine derartigen Probleme. Allerdings hab ich auch eine relativ schwache Brille, vielleicht liegt es daran.

Muy fácil de configurar, el visor da una muy buena sensación de inmersión y los mandos te permiten usar tus manos virtuales con bastante realismo. Con los dos sensores incluidos se puede hacer room-scale y moverse con bastante libertad pero es recomendable un tercero si queréis ampliar vuestra zona de juego y mejorar el reconocimiento de los mandos cuando estáis de espaldas. Importante recordar que el visor utiliza un puerto HDMI de la tarjeta gráfica además de el que utilice el monitor del ordenador y que necesitaréis por lo menos 3 puertos USB 3.0, yo he tenido que comprar un HUB y un adaptador de displayport a HDMI.

After a small misunderstanding everything was hooked up and installed and updated super fast just as it should. Wearing the head piece is comfortable and the view is very good with great depth perception and great tracking as my head moved. The controllers are a bit small in my hands but once I start using them I got use to the feel of the controls. The first problem I've had is that the lens seem to fog or get smudged after a couple of hours and need to be cleaned and sometimes they require cleaning more often. The last is that I find my forehead starting to sweat along the cushioning material and during play have to stop and wipe my fore head and the cushion dry with a towel. And MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ROOM, just as the video showed I moved around and touched a light but realized before it was knocked over and then took the extra time to make my play area larger.

Faccio questa recensione qualche mese dopo il mio acquisto, in quanto ho voluto provare per bene il visore Oculus Rift prima di dare il mio giudizio.Personalmente sono sempre stato un appassionato di tecnologia e di Videogames, quindi appena usci questo prodotto ero entusiasta per quel che prometteva e per quelle che erano le possibilità offerte, nonostante ciò però ho deciso di aspettare che il suddetto prodotto scendesse a un prezzo ragionevole prima di fare il nuovo acquisto, quindi ho aspettato qualche anno e quando il prezzo era diventato finalmente ragionevole ho deciso di fare il grande passo, I visori per la realtà virtuale sono una tecnologia rivoluzionaria, perché ti permettono di immergerti all'interno di un esperienza virtuale, che può essere un videogioco, un film oppure anche altre esperienze di vario tipo,ad esempio visitare un luogo dall'altra parte del mondo, oppure guardare dall'alto verso il basso dalla cima di un grattacielo. Qualsiasi sia l'esperienza che vogliate fare è completamente immersiva e vi sembrerà tutto estremamente reale, certo ancora vi è il lieve effetto zanzariera (ovvero in alcune occasioni potrete notare la griglia dei pixel sullo schermo), ma per come è immersiva la realtà virtuale non ci farete nemmeno caso. Ho fatto provare il visore a un gran numero di amici e parenti e anche quelli che all'inizio erano un po' dubbiosi dopo ne sono rimasti completamente affascinati e stupefatti e alcuni di loro hanno deciso anche di voler comprare un visore, chi per playstation chi proprio l'oculus.Nonostante io scriva questa recensione a mesi dall'acquisto devo dire che non ho mai smesso di usare Oculus Rift e che sono ancora entusiasta del mio acquisto. Non posso che consigliare a chiunque di dare un'opportunità a questa nuova tecnologia, che sono sicuro, presto diventerà di massa, si tratta solo di dare occasione alla gente di provarla più spesso e alla fine molti rimmaranno entusiasti di questa tecnologia e decideranno di acquistarla.

Wer bisher nur die Handy VR Spielereien gekannt hat, wird hier in eine völlig neue Welt katapultiert. Zwar gehört die Oculus Rift noch zu den VR Pionier-Projekten, sie zeigt aber wohin der Zug in den nächsten Jahren fahren wird. So ist mit der aktuellen Technik sicher nicht alles perfekt, z.B. das erkennbare Fliegengitter oder die wenig komfortable bzw. nicht vorhandene Anpassung an Brillenträger, dennoch bietet die Rift jetzt schon ein Erlebnis, welches sich mit nichts vergleichen lässt.Die ersten Gehversuche mit den freien Spielen sind auf jeden Fall schon mal ein guter Einstieg in das Thema, wenngleich sich die allgemeine Erfahrung und Begeisterung natürlich nach einiger Zeit leicht abnutzt. So definieren die Anwendungen und Spiele fortwährend die Qualität eines VR-Systems.In meinem Fall sind das Tennis und Tischtennis Spiele, von denen es insbesondere zwei gibt, die alleine schon die Anschaffung der Brille wert sind: ""Eleven Table Tennis"" sowie ""First Person Tennis"". Für VR sind beide Spiele perfekt, was beim Tennis ein wenig überrascht , da man nicht mal eben 10 Meter laufen kann in der eigenen Wohnung. Über verschiedene Bewegungs-Optionen, insbesondere einem Auto-Slide Modus, kann man aber sehr gut und vor allem sehr realistisch Tennis spielen. Nach ein wenig Eingewöhnung spielt sich der Simulations-Modus beim ""First Person Tennis"" sehr gut und mit ausreichend Gefühl für Schläger und Ball. Die Motivation steigt stetig an immer mehr Turniere zu gewinnen und technisch immer besser zu werden.Besagtes Fliegengitter sieht man bei der Rift auch irgendwann nicht mehr. In jedem Fall ist die Rift erst der Anfang, man darf gespannt sein wie realistisch das Erlebnis erst wird, wenn Technik und Spiele noch einmal einen Quantensprung machen, was mit Sicherheit in den kommenden 5 Jahren der Fall sein wird.

Es ist schwer zu beschreiben, wenn man noch keine Vr-Brille auf hatte. Aber die Darstellung ist der Hammer. Natürlich abhängig vom Spiel. Spiele mit schlechter Grafik sind nur wenige Stunden am stück spielbar (2 oder 3), bevor man eine Pause machen muss. Ein Beispiel hierführ ist Skyrim-Vr. Durch die gigantiche Map ist die Auflösung der Landstriche gering, während die Städte und Items Tadellos sind. Spiele mit besserer Auflösung so wie etwa Beat Saber oder Robot Recall lassen sich Problemlos länger spielen. Positiv überrascht hat mich das Oculus home, was es einem ermöglicht die spiele zu wechseln ohne ständig die Brille abnehmen zu müssen und in Vr auf den Desktop zu zu greifen.

Détection inductive du contact/pression des doigts, mouvement très juste et extrêmement précis, même avec seulement deux capteurs bien placés en 360.Côté poids, rien à dire, c'est vraiment pas gênant.Il s'adapte intelligemment à toutes les tailles de têtes.Un seul petit bémol peut être, je porte des lunettes, et bien qu'elles soient peu volumineuses, ça peut parfois être gênant.Problème réglé en mettant les lentilles pour ma part, mais tout le monde ne le peut pas.Je pense qu'un travail d'amélioration devrait se faire dans ce sens là.Rapport qualité prix vraiment très bien, même si les jeux restent soit chers, soit courts.Le milieu est en pleine naissance, le contenu n'est pas aussi abondant que sur plateformes habituelles, mais je ne regrette pas une minute mon achat.Si tout le monde en achetait un, les concepteurs de jeux s'engouffreraient dans la vague et alors ce serait l'extase, mais dommage que le matos nécessaire pour faire tourner ça correctement soit si cher.D'ailleurs, une deuxième piste d'amélioration serait de pouvoir poser deux casques sur un même pc par exemple.

Das neue Touch-Bundle besteht nur noch aus einem Karton und enthält jetzt keinen XBOX- und keinen Oculus-Remote-Controller mehr. Es sind 2 Sensoren, die Brille, 2 Touch-Conroller, ein Putztuch und 2 Batterien vorhanden. Und natürlich die Spiele wie RoboCall usw..Für das Spielfeld benötigt man mind. eine Fläche von 1,5 x 2 Meter, ansonsten mache einige Spiele keinen Sinn. Die Anfangszeiten wo man mit seiner VR-Brille direkt vor dem Monitor sitzt sind vorbei. Zukünftig soll der Oculus-Shop auch andere Brillen unterstützen und somit werden wahrscheinlich Brillen mit Inside/Out Tracking auch möglich sein. Einmal gestartete Steam VR Spiele erscheinen jetzt auch im Oculus Home Bereich.Ich hatte bisher eine 3 Meter Verlängerung (HDMI und USB - Amazon Basics - geht aber nur bis 3 Meter), die leider nach Raumumgestaltung etwas zu kurz waren.Nach dem letzten Update der Oculus SW auf 1.16 musste ich die Desktop-Auflösung auf 1080p reduzieren. Ansonsten kommt es zu einem Neustart des PCs sobald das HDMI-Kabel angeschlossen wird.Ich nutze jetzt auch eine aktive 5 Meter USB3.0 Verlängerung von deleyCON (https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B073J92722/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) .Update: Das Kabel gibt es jetzt nur noch als 2.0 USB Version über den Link.

It's difficult to describe VR to people who, like myself up until a few days ago, have no prior experience with it but are otherwise very curious (I would guess stemming for so many people right back to the very neat Holodeck concept from Star Trek TNG). Suffice it to say that the technology is finally at a point now where the resulting effects possible on the human brain are, remarkable.You know that it's not real, that in reality you're just standing/sitting in a room somewhere - however on some level your brain does wholeheartedly believe in it. You feel as if you're IN these places, to the point where the best experiences and games can make you completely forget that you're wearing this thing on your head and face. It can make even the most otherwise mediocre, demo, freebie, 5 minute, not worth £3 on Steam etc type experience tangible in a way that isn't possible from even the biggest triple AAA budget title on a traditional monitor. No youtube video, news report/tech video, VR advert etc can do it justice.Is like the Holodeck from Star Trek? Well of course not, but it's a damn sight better than I think many people realise. This is a definite foot in the door. It's not perfect - it can be fiddly to set-up, there are wires everywhere, and for me never quite enough room. The lenses fog up and are generally a bit of a battle to keep clean (especially when you have a family fighting over it). It's also expensive to run requiring an at least ""respectable"" gaming PC before you've even bought the actual headset. And despite some good quality titles appearing now the overall content is still thin on the ground compared to traditional monitor gaming.But again, NONE of that matters when it all comes together. There simply is nothing comparable to VR when it comes together... Buy an Oculus, or a Vive or whatever's coming out next... If you fit into my first paragraph in even the smallest way (and have the cash, hardware and space to run one) then for goodness sake get one! I very much doubt you'll regret it.

Prinzipiell bin ich ein Riesiger VR Fan und konnte mich am Anfang super auf die Oculus einlassen.Die mitgelieferten und Kostenlosen Spiele im Oculus Store machen sehr viel Spaß und sind gut optimiert.Leider lässt die anfängliche Euphorie nach einigen Wochen stark nach, wenn keiner der Freunde ebenfalls die Oculus hat.Man versinkt dann ein wenig in der Virtuellen Welt, solange das Tracking ordentlich funktioniert, welches sehr oft Aussetzer hatte und somit für leichten schwindel sorgte.Die beiden Sensoren wurden Fest an der Wand montiert, und Trotzdem passierte es mehrmals in einem Spiel das sich das bild kurz nicht mit bewegte, da das Headset nicht getrackt werden konnte, trotz dass es im frontalen Sichtfeld von beiden Sensoren war.Daher warte ich lieber bis eine Ausgereiftere Version mit einer besseren Auflösung sowie Trackingfunktion kommt.

Comprato a fine 2018 l'ormai vetusto CV1 mi ha fatto immergere nel mondo della VR ed é stato subito amore. I giochi inclusi sono a dir poco sorprendenti e, anche se sono poco longevi, fanno capire le potenzialità di questo oggetto: Robo Recall ad esempio é uno dei più sorprendenti al livello di immersione e di meccaniche di gioco. Strabiliante é anche Google earth VR fa quasi venire le vertigini quando si zoomma dalla visione della Terra dallo spazio alla destinazione scelta. Da allora sono uscite altre app e giochi molto più sofisticati che non mi hanno fatto stancare della VR. Sicuramente il CV1 non é tra i più immediati caschetti se confrontato con quelli attuali tipo il Quest 2, per via dei tempi di caricamento lunghi (per via soprattutto del mio hardware al limite per questa tecnologia), per via della presenza del cavo HDMI che limita la libertà e la presenza delle torrette per il rilevamento della posizione nello spazio di gioco che ogni tanto viene persa. Punti a favore sono l'ergonomia e il poco peso del caschetto, l'audio delle cuffie integrate molto buono e i controller fenomenali e precisi. Straconsigliato!!!!

Ce casque est très imersif. Je note tout de même un flou assez léger dans 80% des cas mais qui seras se faire oublier compte tenu de l'immersion que propose ce casque. La première fois j'ai vraiment été bleufé par son realisme. Je trouve néanmoins que le contenu proposé actuellement ne vaut pas le coup d'acheter un casque a ce prix. Dans les jeux d'actions on se retrouve très souvent stopper net par un mur alors que l'on souhaiterais avancé. Les deux capteurs ne propose pas une detection complète, il y a toujours une petite zone qui la aussi enleve de l'imersion. Pour les jeux plus calme ou courir et tirer sur tous ce qui bouge ne s'avere pas nécessaire, ce casque est parfait, l'immersion est bleufante. On regrettera tout de même la nausée procurer par les deplacement via l'analoge. Une solution existe pour contourné tous ces problème. Un tapis roulant multi directionnelle qui suprimera et la nausée et les murs. Quand a l'angle mort ajouté un capteur de plus réglerais le soucis. Mais il faudrais ajouté un cable usb de plus. Actuellement il faut posséder 3 ports usb 3.0 et 1 port hdmi sur la carte graphique. Je rajouterai qu'il ne vauy mieux pas y joué en été sous peine de devoir essorai la mousse du casque. En conclusion, très bon casque mais l'achat de certain accessoires le rendrait beaucoup plus plaisant.

Meine Rift hatte leider einen Wackelkontakt im rechten Kopfhörer und es war schwer überhaupt gescheiten Sound zu erhalten.Da der Fehler schon bei der ersten Einrichtung aufgetreten ist, bin ich von der Qualitätskontrolle sehr enttäuscht, zumal es anscheinend ein Fehler ist, den nicht nur mein Gerät hat.Ansonsten ist es eigentlich ein ganz nettes Gerät, nur die Auflösung ist für meinen Geschmack doch zu niedrig, weshalb ich nach der Rücksendung der defekten Rift auch kein Ersatzgerät mehr möchte.Drei Sterne vergebe ich noch für das zuverlässige Tracking, den gelungenen Controllern und dem guten Preis für das Bundle (399€).Wer nicht so viel Wert auf hohe Auflösung legt, kann bestimmt glücklich mit dem Gerät werden.

Il prodotto è veramente ottimo, considerando nel bundle visore, due pad, due telecamere e sei giochi (con il prodotto nuovo, di cui solo 2 realmente allettanti: robot recall e dead and buried). Tuttavia le limitazioni di tale periferica sono ancora molto tangibili e prima tra tutte è un leggero senso di nausea durante un esperienza troppo movimentata (considerando un esperienza in cui ci si sposta rapidamente come su delle montagne russe, vedendo l'immagine e non avvertendo stimoli da tutto il resto del corpo inizia a crescere un senso di nausea).Una pecca che devo assolutamente rimarcare riguarda invece i pad: dopo un paio di giorni, accendendo il dispositivo, ho notato che sul pad sinistro il trigger posteriore se premuto non arrivava a fine corsa e superata una certa pressione il tasto rimaneva direttamente bloccato. Cercando in rete ho scoperto che questo problema relativo ai pad e molto diffuso tra questi dispositivi. Al che, contattando l'assistenza Amazon mi è subito stato inviato un pacco sostitutivo con cui al momento non ho alcun problema.Un ulteriore problema riscontrato sul primo ordine è il seguente:inizialmente era tutto perfettamente funzionante ma non mi era possibile utilizzare il visore con prolunghe USB e HDMI compatibili.Detto questo considerando che solo i pad presi esternamente al bundle costano intorno ai 130€, questo tipo di difetti, per quanto mi riguarda, è totalmente inaccettabile, quindi dovendo valutare il bundle metterei volentieri il massimo ma, questo difetto mi fa calare la valutazione finale dando ai pad una valutazione molto bassa per i materiali utilizzati ma molto alta per la comodità dei pad stessi, in quanto sono realizzati in modo da risultare praticamente quasi assenti durante un'esperienza VR.Se qualcuno avesse intenzione di acquistare il bundle consiglierei anche di acquistare una terza telecamera per triangolare la stanza ed avere un tracking decisamente superiore rispetto alla configurazione con due telecamere.Ricapitolando il tutto direi che il prodotto è veramente ottimo e da un senso di immersività mai visto con giochi convenzionali, anche se tale senso varia in base all'esperienza che si sta sperimentando. Per quanto riguarda la realizzazione del prodotto avrei preferito spendere un po' di più ma avere un prodotto solido e duraturo, ma considerando il prezzo e considerando il contenuto del pacco per quanto riguarda il rapporto qualita/prezzo credo che questo sia il miglior prodotto attualmente in commercio.

Das Gerät an sich ist Top. Keine Probleme, lies sich super einrichten. Auch das ""VR Erlebnis"" an sich ist anfangs überraschend gut. Leider ist die Spiele-Entwicklung noch lange nicht so weit. Es gibt ein paar lohnenswerte Titel wie z.B. ""Arizona Sunshine"" oder ""Paranormal Activity"", diese sind aber meist schon nach 1-3 Stunden durchgespielt. Ich würde noch ein paar Jahre warten da auch neue Produkte in der Entwicklung sind und zumindest ein Vielversprechender Titel angekündigt ist. Sehe aber in der VR-Spiele Welt ein unglaubliches Potential. Für manche Spiele muss man allerdings auch eine gewisse Konstitution mitbringen, da Körpereinsatz häufig gefordert wird.

Hallo, zum Produkt selbst.Bin sehr begeistert von der Rift bis auf den Tag wo mir ein Touchcontroller leider krepierte. Der Analogstick blieb hängen und der Controller fiel selbst ab und zu aus. Batterien wurden gegen neue getauscht, das Problem blieb allerdings. Oculus direkt konnte auch nicht helfen und verwies mich auf den Händler.Eigentlich wollte ich nur einen Ersatz für den Controller, da ich jedoch das Bundle gekauft hatte musste ich alles retounieren. Also gesagt getan.Nun Reklamation und Austausch beantragt. Diesmal bin ich jedoch von Amazon entäuscht. nach ca. 1 Woche wurde das Lieferdatum ohne ersichtlichen Grund um 1 Woche verlängert. Jetzt sind wir in der 2ten Woche und das Paket wurde lt. Amazon noch nicht versendet sollte aber Pünktlich ankommen. Lt. Amazon geht auf meine Wohnadresse leider keine 1 bzw 2 Tages Zustellungen.Ansonsten zu Rift:- macht echt Spass- Tracking funktionniert sehr gut- Fliegengitter-Effekt ist vorhanden aber anscheinend wird da bald von Gehirn kompensiert und man merkt es kaum noch- bei mir keine Probleme mit USB oder HDmi (wurden immer erkannt und haben sich nicht von selbst reconnectet)- Bin Brillenträger was auch kein Problem darstellt (hab ein sehr dezentes Brillenformat was auch eng an den Augen sitzt) bei grösseren Brillen könnte ein Problem entstehen-zu den Spielen, es gibt viele Titel die vielleicht keinen Spaß machen obwohl die Idee top wäre (um den vorzubeugen empfehle ich sich genau über die Spiele zu informieren und Rezessionen zu lesen.- Mit 2 Sensoren funktioniert das ganze recht gut für Shooter empfehle ich jedoch einen 3 Sensor falls man sich schnell drehen muss um Gegner hinter sich zu erwischen- Einrichtung der Sensoren funktioniert bei mir ohne Probleme und ging sehr schnell von statten- Auch mit der Software hatte ich keine Probleme, das einzige was anscheinend nicht so gut klappt ist wenn man sich mit der Oculus Software einlogged und gleichzeitig im Browser das Oculus annimmt man wurde gehackt und das Passwort resettet.Das Bundle um 399,- ist ein guter Deal. 1 Stern abzug weil kleine Details noch fehlerhaft sind und 1 Stern abzug wegen dem Defekt und der Reklamationszeit.

16 August 2017Great cutting edge device. I bought this specifically to fill a need, I wanted to use it for more immersive racing and flight simulation.For these it has surpassed my expectations. I`m using Aerofly 2, IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad and DCS natively and both FSX and X-Plane 11 with an add-on program for flight simulation and using Assetto Corsa, Project Cars and Dirt Rally for the driving/racing.My only gripe is for the availability of quality VR games  generally (which can`t be blamed on the hardware).The Occulus store in particular seems overpriced and vary sparsely populated, games are far too short, overpriced and basic. Steam is a little better but add a performance hit with the steam VR overlay, - it`s really slow and laggy.Although the earphones attached are relatively OK soundwise, I have removed them and opted to use a set of dolby gaming headphones for the sound. The headphones are a comfy fit over the viewer and I found the Occulus ones a tad annoying and uncomfortable. I bought the headset with bundled touch controllers and two sensors when the price was dropped and consider the price I paid to be a good deal.5 November 20172 months on and I feel I have to add to this review. For me personally its still a no-brainer and I`d buy the rift again, but I have to add this information.If you are looking for a polished ""plug and play"" experience, look elsewhere, or wait for this technology to mature as it can be very frustrating getting things to work well with the Oculus Rift.  The games that are available all seem to have been rushed out to take advantage of the new market, and to be brutally honest, most of them are really terrible. Its very hard to find GOOD titles that engage you in the same way as the better established titles do.The titles I mentioned at the top of this review are still the best you`ll find, and they are all older PC games that have VR options, rather than titles written exclusively for VR.Hardware. - you need at least, a GTX 1060 or better, (preferably a GTX1070 or 1080) to get the most out of it. Many games WILL work with less (I was using a GTX 960 for a while) but anything below the recommended specs will lag and drop frames, - Oculus got the recommended specs just right.If you are like me and keen to get a first view of what VR is all about, then I say go for it and buy one, but if you are at all put off by the thought of a lot of tweaking settings to get the rift running smoothly, or not being able to find really good VR games, then I`d advise you to wait a while for the technology to mature properly.

Sehr zweischneidiges Schwert aus meiner Sicht verdient die Technik an sich 5 Sterne aber die Daten Politik von oculus/Facebook ist eine echt bittere Pille. Zudem sollte man sich im Klaren sein dass die meisten Spiele nur für die vive erscheinen.Und selbst wenn sie für oculus erscheinen ist der Software Katalog so mager dass ich mir nicht sicher bin dass man sich eine VR Brille zulegen sollte das ist allerdings natürlich nur meine Meinung. Und auch wenn ich die Hardware gelobt Habe sollte man sich über die Limitierung im Klaren sein. Da das Bild auf zwei kleine Schirme aufgeteilt wird ist es schon sichtbar pixelig und man braucht einen ausreichend starken Computer. Im Prinzip GTX 1070 oder einigsten 1060 aufwärts (natürlich reicht eine GTX 980 auch). Mit der aktuellen RTX Serie von Nvidia sollte das dann allerdings kein Problem seinFazitTechnik HuiSoftware Pfui

My first time playing VR was on this device and it was mind blowing. I've had more fun gaming lately than I have in a very long time, and although it takes some getting used to, the Oculus is super comfortable and easy enough to set up. The built in headphones and mic are also very good, I was very surprised by how well they work.The controllers feel so natural in your hands you quickly forget you're even holding them, brilliance.ConsI wish the sensor chords were longer and I wish a third sensor was included, as even in small spaces you can notice some immersion breaking lulls in the sensor's range. Wouldn't recommend just having them in front of you like the setup recommends, as soon as you turn around your hands would float away. You want to have one sensor on either side of you, one high and one a bit lower if you can manage it. Once it's all set up though you should be okay.Most of the games are $30+ for a game that takes an hour tops to finish, most games feel like Demos and aside from Arizona sunshine they've all felt kind of weak. Poker VR is pretty great to sit down and chill, very social too :)Not a fault of the oculus, or even VR necessarily, but getting past the motion sickness will take a few solid hours of gameplay, especially for thumbstick fluid movement rather than 'teleporting' which I highly recommend getting used to, to play most games better. Some people give up and assume it will always make them feel sick, but trust me, you get used to it after a few days tops.I'm very excited about the future of gaming and I believe the Oculus is as good as it gets for now.

Tiene 6 meses que lo adquirí, y debo decir que fue una excelente compra, la calidad de imagen es impresionante, no provoca nada de mareos. Yo lo uso hasta para hacer algo de ejercicio con BoxVR, cada vez hay más títulos en realidad virtual que valen mucho la pena pero lo mejor es comprarlos desde SteamVR y no desde Oculus Home. Ya que en la tienda de oculus los juegos pueden costar más del doble que en Steam y funcionan igual, los controles son muy cómodos, el tracking que provee las cámaras es igual muy bueno. Lo único que puedo decir en contra es que debes tener mucho cuidado de usar lentes cuando juegas con tu Oculus, lo más seguro es que se rayen los lentes del visor, en la medida de lo posible no los utilices y si lo haces sigue las instrucciones especiales para personas con anteojos.

L'installation du logiciel n'a pas fonctionné le premier jour et j'y ai passé presque 7 heures a essayé diverses solutions. Bugs sur bugs, j'ai passé la plupart de ma journée sur le forum du support pour l'oculus rift. Apparemment, beaucoup d'utilisateurs ont eu des problèmes ce jour là et les choses sont revenues dans l'ordre le lendemain, donc pour être gentil je suis tombé sur le mauvais jour.Pour être plus critique, le manque de communication de la part d'Oculus pour nous informer des problèmes techniques en cours est déjà assez gênant...mais de plus, qu'il y ait autant de problème pour une simple installation de logiciel, en 2018? C'est tout simplement inacceptable.D'après mes recherches c'est d'ailleurs loin d'être la première fois qu'Oculus font des conneries de ce genre (pour en citer l'un des plus importants, cf les problèmes qu'a eu Oculus Rift en mars 2018).En gros, quand ça fonctionne, c'est une expérience assez impressionnante. Mais quand ça fonctionne pas (ce qui arrive apparemment bien trop souvent), bah le casque 'haut de gamme' ne sert absolument à rien.D'autres points peut-être évident mais qui méritent d'être mentionnés : s'assurer d'avoir une pièce de grande taille dans laquelle jouer ; l'idéal serait d'avoir au moins 2*2 m² d'espace. Le minimum pour le confort serait autour de 2*1,5 m² ; pour ceux qui ont des lunettes, c'est pas évident de les porter avec le casque, donc il vaut mieux supposer que vous ne les porterez pas forcément.

Faut vraiment l'essayer pour comprendre ce que ça fait ;)Je pensais que ce serait un gadget, mais une fois dedans, c'est vraiment addictif !On s'y crois vraiment au point d'avoir presque les mêmes sensations qu'en vrai.Ses points négatifs, car il y en a tout de même :- un 3 ème capteur en plus n'est pas refus, car lorsque vous tournez le dos aux 2 capteurs (fournis), ça se met à buguer, et le rift à du mal à suivre. bien sûr ça dépend des jeux, pour la plupart les 2 suffisent amplement.- on vois quand même les pixels, mais on fini par oublier. Ce point est celui qu'il reste à améliorer, en augmentant la résolution notamment, mais qui nécessitera une carte graphique encore plus puissante !Bref, pas déçu de mon achat.

Die Möglichkeiten sich im Raum zu bewegen sind noch relativ beschränkt und auch die Bildqualität der Brille ist gelegentlich schwammig.Ich hab die Brille wieder zurückgeschickt, da ich der Meinung bin das dies noch zu teuer ist für das was man geboten bekommt.

Hallo,habe das Ding leider nicht zum laufen gebracht. Selbst mit den vorgeschriebenen Mindestanforderungen bekomme ich lediglich ein schwarzes Bild. Die Installationssoftware von Oculus selbst sagt zwar das alle Vorraussetzungen ok sind (grüner Haken) aber bei HDMI steht weiterhin no connection. Auch an einem Linux-System mit entsprechender Gforce 1050 Ti wird das Teil nicht erkannt. Treiber etc. natürlich von Nvidia und neueste Version. Dies steht in krassem Gegensatz zu den entsprechenden Wikis und Foren bei der direkt nach dem einstecken ein entsprechender Monitor (Rift) angezeigt wird. Der Support von Oculus konnte auch nicht helfen. Offiziell ist zwar nur Windows unterstützt aber dank openHMD (auf dieses Projekt wird sogar von Oculus auf der Website verwiesen) soll alles unterstützt sein. Nachdem ich es sowohl mit einer neuen Grafikkarte als auch mit einer Ersatzlieferung von Amazon versucht habe (danke hierfür an Amazon für die schnelle Ersatzlieferung) gebe ich entnerft auf. Während die erste Version dieser Brille (DK1) einwandfrei von allen unseren Rechnern auch unter Linux erkannt wird, bekomme ich bei dieser Version nur und ausschließlich ein schwarzes Bild. Ich zweifel wirklich an mir selbst - falls jemand einen Tipp hat woran das liegen könnte bitte ich um Nachricht. Ich versuche es jetzt mal mit der HTC Vive...Danke an Amazon für die unkomplizierte Rückabwicklung. Ich hätte Sie lieber behalten nur was soll ich machen... Kann nicht verstehen warum Version 1 hier bei uns problemlos überall läuft und erkannt wird und die neuen einfach nicht funktioniert. Facebook sei dank!

Nicht nur dass ich nach jedem Update ( was ich in der Firewall ausgestellt habe) die Sensoren neu einrichten muss. Jetzt habe ich mir einen überteuerten dritten sensor gekauft und er lässt sich nicht einrichten. Die komplette Oculus Software ist sowieso für ahnungslose Schulkinder geschrieben worden.

I have been playing way too much of this lately.  My only issue is that I need to buy a 3rd sensor if I want to be able to get tracking when turned around.Most people think that VR is just about head tracking, but they don't realize this generation of VR has motion tracking, and the Rift takes it to the next level with their Touch controllers, allowing you to make a fist, point your finger, give a thumbs up all in VR. It makes for an amazing experience.

Con suficiente espacio y una buena colocación de los sensores, el tener un tercero mejora completamente la experiencia VR, dando mucha más libertad de movimiento e incluso la posibilidad de girar 360° sin que se pierdan los controles.Este sensor incluye la extensión activa de USB 2.0.  Recomiendo adquirir un par de extensiones activas USB 3.0 para la colocación de los otros dos sensores, de esta manera la computadora puede quedar atrás, y estorbar menos durante la experiencia VR.Indispensable para una optima experiencia VR

Con el Oculus Rift es mi primera incursión en la VR y es impresionante. El casco es ligero y cómodo, pero el plástico del visor hace que se sude un poco después de un tiempo de uso, el ajuste de la parte superior no es muy bueno pero los laterales si, por lo que el casco queda muy bien sujeto. Los audífonos que tiene incorporados suenan muy bien y ayuda mucho a la inmersión en el mundo VR. Los controles Touch son excelentes: intuitivos, ligeros, reconocen perfectamente los movimientos de la mano, se debe sujetar a la muñeca para que no salgan disparados en algún movimiento rápido de mano. Compre el oculus en lugar del HTC Vive después de ver comparaciones y por el costo-beneficio y fue una excelente decisión.Es importante considerar que la PC a usar debe ser de muy buen nivel así como la tarjeta grafica, para ver compatibilidad se baja una utilitaria del sitio de oculus que analiza el equipo a usar.El único punto que considero un problema es que el cable que se conecta en el caso se mueve fácilmente y causar falso contacto entre la PC y el oculus, que entonces ya no reconoce el caso, al principio pensé que era la tarjeta gráfica o la configuración pero después de investigar e invertir bastante tiempo encontré que era un falso en el cable en la parte de la conexión al caso, lo desconecte y volví a conectar y todo funcionó Ok, entonces le agregue un sujetador de cables y acomode para evitar este problema y ha funcionado bien. Por lo demás todo excelente y existe una gran cantidad de juegos y programas VR compatibles con oculus (muchos y muy buenos)

Tellement de chose à dire sur la VR, mais je vais tenté de rester sur la qualité du casque et seulement le casque.Alors première chose, l'installation.Celle ci que facile et assez rapide, il vous faut absolument un endroit très dégagé pour pouvoir y jouer dans de bonne condition.Par ex, moi sur des jeux ne nécessitant peu de mouvement (assis avec des mouvements peu amples) j'ai tenté de jouer sur mon fauteuil gamer... Et bien, ça ne marche pas super. Il est quasiment impossible de jouer sur son bureau. La plupart du temps, les capteurs n'arrivent pas à détecter mes manettes si je descends un poil trop bas les bras.De ce fait, je suis obligé de m'écarter sur bureau d'1 mètre au minimum afin de pouvoir jouer.Ce qui est pénible dans mon cas.Sinon, le casque en lui même est assez agréable à porter. Les angles de vue sont assez bons, on a un effet de cadrillage mais même sur les nouveaux casques ça existe encore.La mousse qui fait le contour est agréable. Le soucis c'est qu'on ne peut pas la détacher. Et ça après plusieurs utilisation ou joueur... Pas très hygiénique. Faudra penser à acheter une mousse détachage en accesoire.Cependant, les manettes sont ultra ergonomique, prendre en main un jeu est très facile même pour quelqu'un n'ayant jamais trop joué sur manette. Ca fait penser un peu au Wiimote de l'époque avec les mamans qui arrivaient à jouer aux jeux vidéo.Sinon il y a un poil trop de cable, et il faut bcp de port usb (3 en tout).Un bon casque en somme.

Ich habe die Oculus Rift gebraucht erstanden. Ich habe mich bewust für das ältere, computergebundene Modell entschieden. Es war ein Geschenk für meinen Sohn. Er war auch total begeistert, als er es ausgepackt hatte.Das Anschließen und installieren war für uns erst schwierig, da mir nicht klar war, dass der zweite HDMI-Anschluss am Computer meines Sohnes nicht dafür geeignet ist (Er befindet sich am Motherbord und nicht an der Grafikkarte, wie ich inzwischen weiß...).Leider hat die Grafikkarte meines Sohnes nur einen HDMI-Anschluss. Dieser wurde bislang vom Monitor genutzt. Da sie aber auch noch einen älteren Monitoranschluss hat, konnte mir der Verkäufer den Tipp geben, den Monitor mit einem Adapter an den alten Anschluss zu nutzen und die Oculus Rift dann mit dem freigewordenen HDMI-Anschluss. (Die Grafikkarte ist für VR zwar am unteren Level aber mit ihren 6 GB gerade noch geeignet.)Das hat dann super und schnell und unkompliziert funktioniert!Mein Sohn ist total begeistert von seiner Oculus Rift und ich, dass es duch die schnelle und sehr freundliche Hilfe des Verkäufers auch wirklich gut funktioniert!

I never tried VR before and it was a shock when I first tried. It's a whole new world whats wanting for you when you put on the glasses. The headset is very comfortable, and the touch controls are very, I mean very intuitive to play with. It's been like I've been using them for years. I think the only issue with the Oculus(and other VR headsets I guess) the cable management. So many cables to manage. First I used it with 2 sensors for 360 roomscale setup, but there was minor tracking issues. I think my playing area is too big for them, so I got a third sensor. Now its working without any problems. I really recommend the Oculus Rift to anybody who wants to bring home entertainment to a whole new level.

Si vous achetez le casque en achat reconditionné Amazon, vous ne pourrez pas obtenir les jeux gratuits (je confirme donc le commentaire de BG). La politique d'oculus est d'affecter les jeux sur le premier compte qui déclare les manettes ""touch"" ; les jeux ne sont pas transférables d'un compte à l'autre. Si on achète le casque pour 250 euros ça va, si on le paye 340 la pillule est un peu dure à avaler (pour ma part prix d'occasion = 312 euros, donc c'est entre les deux... ; Les prix fluctuent chaque jour sur les offres reconditionnées. Pour moi à plus de 300 il ne faut pas acheter, et encore pour ce prix l'appareil doit être ""comme neuf"" sinon il faut mieux attendre et acheter neuf).Je trouve dans tous les cas la communication d'amazon sur le sujet plus que légère, la description du produit DEVRAIT OBLIGATOIREMENT mentionner ce détail qui pèse lourd dans l'addition finale.Pour le casque en lui même, rien à signaler, il fait le job ; jouer à Lone Echo en VR est tout simplement grisant. Si vous êtes naturellement sujet au vertige, n'espérez pas néanmoins faire des sessions de jeu de plus d'une heure sauf si vous voulez vous rendre malade :-) Un bon produit, j'enlève deux étoiles pour le manque de clarté sur l'offre reconditionnée ; sans cela j'aurais mis quatre étoiles.Attention également => nécessite trois ports USB (dont deux ports en usb 3.0) et un HDMI libre. Vérifiiez bien les prérecquis matériel avant d'acheter. Pour ma part core i5-3570 / 16Go ram / Nvidia gtx 1060 6Go ; je joue en LOW à lone echo (seul jeu testé pour l'instant).

Finally got around to buying a VR set. The bundle is expensive but great value considering what you get. I was very torn between the Oculus Rift and the Vive and still not too sure if I made the right choice. Firstly VR is great. I was wondering if I would actually get the usage out of it, and the price coupled with an expensive video card upgrade really made me hesitant. I am pleased I did buy it and it does get plenty of use. There are loads of games and videos available, a lot of them are free, so there is new stuff to try on almost a daily basis. VR is great, you feel like you are literally in the virtual world. My observations below are in no way detracting from my enjoyment of the Rift headset, but if you are coosing one, they are worth noting. I don't own the Vive so can't comment on whether it suffers from the same issues, but these are things worth looking into prior to deciding which one to buy and parting with your hard earned money.Observations:The Rift is not Glasses friendly. You can use it with glasses but it is not very comfortable. There are websites that clip in lenses speciallyfor the Rift but even these do not get fantastic reviews.The Rift lenses suffer from lens flare. This is very noticable on darker screens. Some people seem more perseptive than others though and find it ruins the experience, I find it quite noticable at times but it doesn't bother me.If you are a Steam user, then a small number of games are for the Vive only. 90% will work on both and there are still loads and loads for Oculus but Steam is obviously going to cater for their own as a priority. Even some of the Vive will work but tend to have minor glitches. Oculus does have it's own store though, but I don't like having two libraries for games.The Rift needs room. I thought I could get away with a small amount of space and play seated or standing games, but you soon find that even thoughs require a reasonable area. For these you need at least 2m x 2m and setting up the sensors so everything is visable from floor to standing hight means that you need to be seated an additional couple of meters from the PC.Everyones face is different. If you want multiple people to use the headset then you have to recalibrate the eye distance, and undo three straps. Doesn't take long, but annoying that I have to re-adjust eveything just to show a game to the wife.The headset gets warm. Not hot, just warm. This is quite a big problem if you wear glasses as they will steam up very quickly. There are loads of tricks that people have advised to get around this, but it is my biggest annoyance especially if you are moving around and sweating a little.The faceplate sponge is a sweat magnet. Protectors and replacements can be bought through Amazon thoughDon't let any of these observations put you off from buying, just be aware of them. I'm under the impression that all the VR sets suffer to some degree from these issues and none of them really upset my experience. The difference between Vive and Rift is likely down to personal choice rather than design and both will do room scale out the box. I was swayed more by price at the time of purchase as Rift was discounted. Now that Vive has also come down in price I don't know which way I would sway. However I do not regret buying the Oculus Rift at all.

L'emballage sera endommagé."" ayant déjà commandé un autre produit par Warehouse dans le même état décrit je ne m'en faisais pas.À l'arrivée du produit, celui-ci présentait un grand défaut sur la manette droite : La gâchette principale restait enfoncée  lorsqu'on appuyait dessus. Le casque n'était pas reconnu par le logiciel d'Oculus ni même correctement par l'ordinateur, le câble USB / HDMI du casque se déconnectait et le voyant USB clignotait ""validé"" puis en recherche après. À l'intérieur du casque se trouve un voyant avec un détecteur, ce même voyant n'arrêtait pas de clignoter orange à chaque fois.J'ai contacté le support Oculus qui m'a demandé d'effectuer une série de tests et d'essayer divers solutions qui n'ont pas fonctionné. Je me suis alors rabattu sur les forums et divers sites parlant de ce même problème de non reconnaissance du casque sur le logiciel Oculus mais aucune solution même une réinstallation complète de Windows n'a résolu le problème.Les deux capteurs fonctionnent parfaitement en revanche et sont tout de suite détectés.Mis à part ça de ce que j'ai pu tester pour le casque et les Oculus Touch. Le casque en lui même est léger, beaucoup plus qu'un HTC Vive, le câble a l'air d'être moins encombrant également et les Oculus Touch sont elles aussi plus légères que les manettes du Vive, à voir comment c'est en jeu mais la prise en main est agréable.L'Oculus a l'air d'être un bon produit, mais je ne recommande pas aux personnes qui souhaitent le prendre, de le prendre d’occasion mais plutôt en neuf si ce n'est pas sur Amazon, alors allez directement sur le site d'oculus.

Bought this for my grandson who has used it extensively and reported very happy overall. Placement of the sensors is a little limited by the length of the included leads if you want a room type setup where you move around. If you are happy with a desk setup then all is fine. Headset can fog up a bit on hot, humid days, but not a major problem. Motion sickness problems vary with users and games you play. Can be quite nauseating.

Rien à voir avec les bidouillages fait avec un smartphone.L'immersion est très prenante.Toutefois, il faut prévoir des rallonges HDMI et USB 3.0 de 3m à 5m si vous souhaitez jouer en room scale 360 (j'arrive à faire sans trop de soucis du 3m x 3m malgré que ça ne soit pas recommandé par Oculus.).Dommage que les câbles entravent de temps à autres les mouvements.

Der Lieferung kam in der Zeit (sogar früher), die Verpackung ist absolut makellos und die Verarbeitung des Geräts ist ohne Mängel. Funktioniert alles tadellos und die mitgelieferten Batterien für die Controller halten echt lange. Ich kann dieses Paket (damals für etwa 380,00 gekauft) nur empfehlen. Auf Steam laufen auch einstweilen der Großteil der VR Spiele mit der Rift. Man sollte aber immer zur Sicherheit vorher schauen ob es auch ausdrücklich bei dem Spiel dabei steht. Habe zu diesem Produkt nichts negatives zu melden. Auch die Kalibrierung geht einfach und ohne Probleme.

J'ai acheté ce casque pour jouer en VR, principalement avec Elite Dangerous, d'ailleurs c'est carrément un autre jeu en VR, c'est difficile de décrire l'immersion que ça procure avec ce jeu. Époustouflant pourrait convenir. ! (Avec HOTAS). Sinon le casque est super bien emballé, le matériel respire la qualité. La configuration est simple. Une bonne carte graphique est cependant nécessaire (mini une 780 pour ED), une mémoire 8 Go mini  (16 c'est mieux) faible latence est fortement recommandée. Reçu en temps et en heure via Amazon. On verra ce que les futurs casques feront de plus ou de mieux. Pour le moment, je suis très satisfait de ce casque.

Mir persönlich gefällt die Oculus sehr gut. Die Sensoren funktionieren perfekt. Die Spiele,die gratis dabei sind, sind ebenfalls sehr gut. Noch dazu gibt es eine große Auswahl an Spielen die man dazu kaufen kann, welche ebenfalls sehr viel Spaß machen und auch nicht zu teuer sind.Das Erlebnis ist auch einfach nur perfekt. Allerdings an alle die unter motionsickness leiden, sollten  es lieber lassen. Sonst kann einem sehr schlecht werden. Ansonsten eine glatte Kauf Empfehlung.

Leider ruinieren die ständigen Verbindungsabbrüche der HDMI Verbindung jegliches VR Erlebnis. Wofür brauche ich einen Oculus Client wenn alles ebenfalls über Steam VR abgedeckt wird. Meine Spielebibliothek befindet sich auf Steam, nicht bei Oculus oder Facebook. Ich will auch nicht drei verschiedene Anwendungen maintainen nur damit ein Gerät funktioniert. Das Oculus Home ist im Prinzip ein 1:1 Klon zu dem Steam Home. Bis jetzt eine negative Erfahrung im Vergleich zur ersten Generation der HTC Vive. Der Preisunterschied kompensiert leider nicht für die Differenzen, wie z.B. längere Setup-Dauer, kleinerer Sichtwinkel, fehlendes Laden der Controller über micro-USB, Probleme bei der Connectivity über HDMI, mehr Anwendungen, die im Hintergrund laufen müssen etc.Der einzige positive Aspekt gegenüber anderer Geräte ist die Größe und das Gewicht, welche aber bei der Vive unbedeutsam werden sobald man in die VR Welt eintaucht.

There were some initial issues with the USB 3.0 connections. (In short connecting Oculus messed up windows recognition system so that every connection showed as 3.0 even when only 2.0 which caused issues with connecting older items)That said, the device it's self works well. It's not heavy or cumbersome. The immersion is incredible (Using gtx 1060 6gb graphics card) Touch controls are fluid and responsive and when paired with the right games the experience is really out of this world.If your thinking of entering the VR arena, think carefully about your choice. There are 3 options on PC being the Vive, Oculus and Windows mixed reality. Then there is the PlayStation 4 PSVR. Each has its strengths, cost being one of them but the thing to remember is EXCLUSIVES!! Each is trying to tempt you to choose them over their competition and as a result are paying for game exclusives. Like Resident Evil 7 VR is playstation exclusive. Fallout 4 VR isn't offically supported on Oculus. ARKTIKA.1 is Oculus exculsive. My way around that was to buy the PSVR in blackfriday sales which gave me access to games like Fallout VR and Doom VRF as well as other PS exculsives.I personally like the Oculus Rift and it was priced better for my liking. (The Vive is still to pricey) but a word of advice. If you decide to plum for the Oculus, invest in some USB 3.0 extension leads, HDMI extension lead and if you want 360 tracking (like the Vive) invest in a 3rd sensor. The reason, the cables attached to the sensors are to short. Restricting placement for good coverage and without 3rd sensor all action is front facing which means if you turn away from sensors you loose tracking. It can be immersion breaking, but not a massively. The leads are really cheap, but a 3rd sensor is around £50. I personally think its all worth it, because once you've played say a horror game like Paranormal Activity or FPS like ARKTIKA.1 in VR nothing else compares.Hope this helps those thinking about VR, but if you have a question ask away.

Alors oui, ce que l'on dit de mal sur l'Oculus Rift est vrai : il y a un effet de grille, c'est un peu flou, les textes sont durs à lire, la résolution n'est pas fantastique et certaines expériences peuvent se révéler déstabilisantes... Mais quelle claque ! Je ne m'attendais pas à une telle aventure ! On se retrouve littéralement plongé dans l'univers des jeux, rien à voir avec les anciens procédés 3d, ici l'immersion est totale. Moi qui suit sujet au vertige, je vous dit pas les sensations et les déséquilibres éprouvés lorsque je me suis retrouvé à incarner Spiderman au sommet d'une grue !...Les jeux et logiciels fournis dans le bundle permettent de découvrir un large panel des possibilités offertes par la réalité virtuelle. Les occulus touch répondent parfaitement, pouvoir se servir naturellement de nos mains c'est quand même autre chose que d'interagir avec une souris ou une manette.... Du coup, peindre et sculpter en relief se révèle fascinant et certains artistes ont déjà accompli des oeuvres somptueuses, ouvrant à ces disciplines de nouveaux horizons. Lucky's Tale révolutionne le jeu de plateforme, Robo Recall est excellent et que dire de Dead and Buried ? A part que je me suis retrouvé à plat ventre dans mon salon à tirer  sur d'autres Cow-Boys planqués derrière le comptoir du Saloon...Revenir à un écran plat pour jouer me semble désormais bien... plat, justement. Des textures, aussi fines qu'elles soient et une haute résolution, ce n'est pas aussi immerssif. On oublie donc tous les défauts de jeunesse et on attribue la note maximale à cette révolution numérique, car oui, le passage à la VR, c'est l'avenir dans bien des domaines...P.S.: J'ai rencontré un petit problème qui a été très vite réglé par le support technique d'Oculus. Si comme moi (et d'autres, si j'en crois les forums qui traitent du sujet) les logiciels fournis en bundle n'apparraissent pas dans la bibliothèque, n'hésitez pas à les contacter. Ils vous demanderont les numéros de série des Touchs (dans le compartiment à pile) et celui du casque (collé sur la boite) et en deux temps trois mouvements vous pourrez profiter de tout...

The rift was not originally planned for room scale tracking and it shows as needing the 3rd sensor for proper 360 room tracking.Distance and field of view and reach of the base stations are not the greatest.Expect to buy USB extension cables for stations when having medium place space.Screen door effect is noticeable but mostly ignored after you immerse yourself.The headset cable is not that short for a medium-sized area.The face pad it comes with is not the greatest.The touch controllers are amazing battery life is about a week so investing in rechargeable batteries is a must.Base stations definitely need some better mounts, but fortunately the use industry standard 1/4 threads so any cheap security camera mounts would do.Also had problems with people using it while wearing glasses so be aware.The god rays effect is also quite noticeable.

Après avoir tester l'HTC Vive qui est pourtant très bien mais j'ai préférer l'Oculus Rift, pourquoi ?Et bien pour plusieurs raisons:- Le coût, et oui, on ne va pas se mentir le coût de la technologie est très élevé même si elle a quand même diminué depuis quelques temps.- Le confort, j'ai largement préférer le confort du Rift à celui de l'Oculus, déjà il est plus léger et on ne le sens pas trop même après plusieurs longues heures de jeux.- L'ergonomie des manettes, les Touchs sont très jolies mais surtout très confortable et pratique à utilisé que celle de son homologue qui par ailleurs sont beaucoup moins esthétique.- La qualité d'affichage, sur le Rift j'ai moins vu l'effet de grille que sur le Vive de plus je trouve les couleurs plus vive et plus agréableSeul un petit défaut notable, il existe un léger jour entre le casque est le bas de notre nez mais il n'est pas visible une fois en jeuxPar contre niveau performance il vaut mieux avoir un très bon pc, GTX 960 recommandé au minimum, personnellement j'ai une GTX970 et un I7 4790K et tout va bien, couplé avec 8Go de RAM il arrive que certaine application comme Oculus Medium galère lors de grosse création mais sinon tout passe bien

The oculus rift is a winner, the experience is fantastic if you can get through the set up.A few pointers I'd make is:1. Be very careful with the lenses, they can become scratched by glasses, leaving marks that leave an irritating blur in the centre of vision.2. If you want to be able to turn 360 degrees and be able to face away from your computer, you need to set up a good sized space with either two cameras high in opposing corners (ensure they are facing towards the center) or purchase an additional sensor or two and place them facing inwards at equal distances around your play space.3. The controllers can sometimes become faulty and become loud and clicky due to the shifting of a rubber bumper in the trigger over time.Oculus support have been outstanding in my experience, simply make sure you have a good case for return, be polite and provide GOOD evidence.4. Sometimes the screens in units can be faulty, with unbalanced illumination in one screen over the other, this can cause a distracting effect in dark environments ingame, where it feels like one eye is blind.I have successfully applied for a replacement for this issue, but gathering evidence was difficult. If you encounter this issue and it bothers you enough to request replacement here is how I got my replacement: use the ""big picture"" oculus app, launch into the black environment and place something over the oculus proximity sensor, get a halfway decent camera (anything that can take long exposure photos) and take photos of the oculus lenses, this should show a difference in brightness, which is good evidence to use.Finally be aware about what cables you buy for use with the oculus and sensors, and make sure you have at least 3-4 USB 3.0 ports free and a decent computer before purchasing to avoid disappointment.

I want to preface this by saying I've used every form of modern VR. I've used the original DK1 Oculus. I bought the DK2. I own a Samsung Gear. All of these made for pretty decent VR experiences, but I could feel the future was definetely in this tech.Then came the CV1 of Oculus Rift - and it was great. Something was definetely missing though. Something HTC Vive later added with the full 360 degree freedom and touch controls.Now - here comes Oculus and completely blows the Vive out of the water with the Touch Controls.Here's reasons the Oculus Touch controllers are better than the HTC Vive controllers:[ * ] Controller: Smaller form factor makes for more ergonomic grip.[ * ] Controller: Better buttons & softer, more flexible triggers[ * ] Controller: Every button has touch function, adding yet another layer of depth to the controllers abilities.Here's reasons the Oculus Headset is better than the HTC Vive headset:[ * ] Headset: Much lighter - doesn't stress the neck as much as the Vive - I've played 5-6 hours without getting strained.[ * ] Headset: Less noticeable screen-door effect (and by extension, zero motion sickness)[ * ] Headset: Better straps that auto-adjust to your head, better lens distance controls[ * ] Headset: Built in microphone and earphones that make communication in multiplayer-games easier.[ * ] Headset: Less bulky cables - the whole headset connects through just one thin tube-cable as opposed to the Vive's flat 3-cable solution.Here's reasons the Oculus trackers are better than the HTC trackers:[ * ] Tracking stations: Better built with full-metal, weighted stands.[ * ] Tracking stations: Draws power from USB 3.0, doesn't require additonal power-supplies.[ * ] Tracking stations: More flexible in placements - doesn't really need their own tripods/mounts.You might ask, ""okay, but what's the drawback?"". You're right to ask!The major drawback of this bundle is that with only 2 tracker stations, you're limited to 180 or 270 degree tracking, depending on your setup. Beyond that your controllers might lose tracking briefly, and your headset can ""jitter"" a little bit when it loses the positional tracking. In order to get full 360 degree tracking, you should to buy an additional tracking station. It's possible to get 360 with just 2 trackers, but it's not as good. In my opinion though this isn't really a dealbreaker - especially not at this pricepoint. A lot of games offer a secondary form of turning (like using your joystick), which is honestly preferrably in a lot of cases to avoid tangling into the cable.So, overall, the Oculus Rift is a fantastic device and when it comes down to the headsets currently out on the market this is the most bang for your buck you're gonna get. Oculus slipped behind a little in the race when every other company started churning out their own headsets, so it's sad to see that they've caught such a bad rep in the VR world when they've honestly produced THE best headset on the market - it just took them a little more time to perfect it.

It's very good product, after 3 years it still works perfectly with a slightly lower resolution than its successor the Oculus Rift S but with better Black colors and obviously cheaper price. The competition is either much more expensive or cheap on the hardware and will deteriorate faster over time (htc vive). The only thing you really need with this is a tissue designed for the mask that will be in contact with the skin of your face whenj you put the mask on. so you can clean it when you sweat too much instead of letting the foam of the mask absorbing the sweat from your face, the tissue costs like 5 bucks and is good quality.

Concept des manettes confortable mais trop petites.6 Jeux offerts bon début pour les utilisateurs.Casque simple et capteurs aussi, mais comparé au vive je prefere l’autre puisqu’on peut ajuster la vue pour les myopes et non seulement les lentilles.Mais cette marque est toujours de bonne qualité.

I jumped at the opportunity to get this package at the bundle price, I can't wait because my eyesight seems to be failing.ON the positive: It is an amazing experience. It can really fool your brain, and put you into a different world. Elite dangerous, a space game, is particularly amazing.and the negative? Only if you wear glasses. It is scarcely possible to use this headset. I have tried many things, including making my own custom glasses to fit into the headset. But they simply don't work. I only use my contact lenses with the Oculus, glasses are simply not workable.You WILL scratch the internal lenses if you wear glasses, that is unavoidable.So that is it, brilliant, but with reservations. You can buy special lenses on the internet, I'm debating doing this since they are pretty expensive.

I purchased the Oculus Rift for Prepar3d and Elite Dangerous.The headset is well made and surprisingly comfortable. It worked first time out of the box except for issues with sound disengaging in game. This was fixed by turning off USB power save in windows 10.Setup is a little confusing but after an hour of trial and error everything works well. Sensor placement can be challenging if you have limited space but works flawlessly once setup correctly.You will need to invest in a good HOTAS joystick and throttle as you cannot use mouse with ED.The immersion with this headset is unreal. The view through the headset is a little pixelated and blurry at your peripheral vision but the immersion more than makes up for this. It does actually fool your brain into thinking you are inside a spaceship or aircraft. Try walking to the hatch in the rear of the Asp. I nearly fell down it!The only big issue is eye strain. An hour tops before your eyes are very tired.The built in ear phones are weak and do not fit my ears so I removed them with the supplied tool and use my own.The touch handsets are brilliant and work perfectly unfortunately ed doesn't work with them. They are still worth it.I give the rift 8 - 10. Better resolution and less blurries gets it a 10. However this is cutting edge so if you want vr this is it.

No instructions on how to install the setup.  Did not work at first.  Problems with usb not working and updated software not being recognized as updated.  Got stuck at the continue in headset part.  Was no stuff to look at except the background.  Uninstalled all the software.  R4einstalled the windows update parts and it worked.  As for the product when it is working.  The controllers could fit a bit more snug in hand.  Gets tiring having to grip them.  Lenses steam up a bit.  Turned on my cieling fan and it cured that.  As for the games and experience... IT IS AMAZING.  For the price now its definitely something you should buy if you got a decent PC.  As for the wires I have installed 3 bungee cords on ceiling.  There are alternative ceiling mounts and wire booms.  I chose this method and it only cost me £7 This is important as 3 times we stood on the wires and nearly ripped pc of the table.  Until you tried this on and had a go its impossible to be described how it feels.  I have felt sick, dizzy, screaming in fear. In fact it brings out emotions i thought had gone forever.  Watching Amazon Videos with it is great too.  Even find myself putting my feet up on the virtual cinema seats and wondering where my legs have gone.  There are many types of VR experiences and one will suit you.  Project Cars is so realistic.  All thats missing is the G forces and wind.  If you ok with messing about for an hour or so to get it set up then grab it at this silly price.Yopu can use steam with it too and many other software companies.

After having the PSVR on PS4Pro and playing most of what was on offer it was good but just didnt have that 'wow' factor for me, So I took the risk and purchased the Oculus Rift Touch bundle while on offer @£399 and hoped it was better in some way and to cut a long story short im glad I did the feel, Graphics, Resolution, Polish and overall experience is almost night & day difference for the better and the controllers are amazingly accurate. So if your wondering if its worth it or your on the fence I would say go for it 100% but I'd like to share a few tips before you buy that may help..1) Go to the oculus website and download the compatibility check program, It will tell you if anythings lacking from your system before buying.2) Unless you have 3 Free USB 3.0 slots at the back of your computer and even then it's picky if you do, your going to need a USB 3.0 PCI Card as extra I went for the Inateck 5 Port model which works fine.3) The Headset plugs into a HDMI slot on the back of your graphics card which my single slot was already taken by my 4ktv/Monitor and the only free slots I had was Display Port only, You cannot simply hot swap between the two devices because you need to see whats happening on the montior so I solved this problem by buying the 'CSL - 4K Ultra HD Displayport to HDMI adapter with audio transmission' Priced at £8.99 from Amazon which again works perfect.4) There is virtually no instructions in the box and until you goto the oculus website and download the app your flying blind, so dont be hasty and start plugging things in until you have installed the Oculus Home App which takes you through the whole process step by step.The setup process is a bit of a pain and took several tries with setting up the much smaller than expected sensors and play area, But after that's done your good to go and enjoy the tons of content on the oculus & steam store.

Absolutely amazing vr experience until today I'd only tried psvr and today after a easy and simple set up my mind was blown by the Oculus. The free games are great especially Robo recall and I also bought Superhot Vr and it was mind blowingly cool it makes you feel like you're in the matria.  If you want a vr for a great price and trust me I think all £405.99 Inc postage was worth every single penny not a single regret. The headset is very light compared to the psvr and the touch controllers feel so natural and when handling guns in game the touch controllers feel like you're holding a weapon. Trust me buy one if you can you won't regret it ; )

I bought this after owning the Google daydream headset, the daydream was good, but it lacked the immersion required to make you feel you were somewhere else. The Rift is a hugely different experience, deliving an interactive world that you can move around in. In the demo I was blown away by being able to crouch down and look under the desk. When I tried to pull on the virtual desk to stand up I fell on my real face. My brain was tricked! Google Earth VR is one of the most amazing  experiences I've had. Honestly no idea how they have mapped a 3D world.Set up was fine, although I was hampered by one of the earphones not working. I spent a good few hours messing around with drivers, only to find that the earphone is connected with a screw and contacts, tightening the screw fixed the issue for me.You need 3 free USB ports for the sensors and headsets. I'm using 3 USB 3.0 ports, but I think it allows you to plug one of the sensors into a USB 2.0The guardian system allows you to map out a virtual playspace in the real world, so if you are approaching a wall or furniture in the real world the system throws up a virtual blue Grid to show you the limits.I've set a play space up in the front room, spacing the sensors fairly wide gives you almost 360 degrees, a 3rd sensor will give you full 360.I bought the bundle for 399 during the summer sale, at this price with everything included it's a bargain.You can also set it up to work with Steam VR for even more experiences.Highly Recommended

Oculus Rift est un bon produit irréprochable avec une prise en main agréable cependant je déplore le manque de jeu VR en effet actuellement je n'ai que 3 jeux dessus après en avoir retourné certains qui ne me plaisaient pas. Outre le catalogue de jeu encore un peu faible c'est un bon produit.

Gaming will never be the same.  Where to start?  From the moment you start installing this I could feel the excitement building and I was not disappointed.  The setup was seriously simple and I lost count of the times I said WOW.  But this is VR for the first time for me so I guess that's to be expected.This device is easy to setup, not as uncomfortable as it looks and the controllers are great.  Be sure to spend some time adjusting the straps and not have it too tight as this did give me a headache to start with - and this device makes it easy to adjust.My one criticism is about the cable attached to the side (USB and HDMI) to the PC.  Some games that require you to spin around can be tedious because the cable gets tied up in your chair. Even in a cockpit style game I find the cable draped over my shoulder to be annoying so I've stuck a plastic cable holder to the back of my chair to keep the cable behind me.Overall I love this device and look forward to seeing more choice of games and apps.

I bought this during the Oculus summer sale at £399 and found it very easy to setup and have working. I also purchased and Anker 4 port USB 3.0 hub, that I use for the two sensors and both show as connected via USB 3.0 within the Oculus set up software. I plugged the headset into an HDMI on my graphics card, with my monitor attached to a Display port as well as to it's own USB 3.0 direct on my PC motherboard.I also own the PlayStation PSVR and can confirm little difference in the quality of the display during use. I do like the PSVR nose cover as the Oculus leaves this more open and you can see through the gap around the bridge of your nose. This was however, less of a problem when playing a game as I was very immersed and did not notice the gap. It is great that the Oculus comes with attached speakers where you really need additional headphones with the PSVR. The speakers are loud and give good detail and kept me in the vr experiences I have tried.My other main difference is that the PSVR seems mainly designed around a seated experience except when using the aim controller, but again this is a more static experience from all the games and experiences I have used on my PSVR and play pro. The Oculus, now coming with the touch controllers has opened up into more of a room scale and during setup, you mark the edge of your room to allow it to tell you when you are reaching past your borders and about to hit the wall!My problem with this is that I do not have a large room, where my PC is stored. It is about 6 foot by 11 foot but with my computer and desk there is little movement room left and the sensor view to reach the floor is limited by my desk. There had been no recommendation for room size and this is why I have dropped a star! It seems from running set up for SteamVR for room scale, my play space is not big enough and within Oculus it is not the best. I have noted that the PC versions of games and experiences use moor movement and allow you to pick items from the floor. This has occasionally been difficult for me to do as they have been laying in VR space, just beyond my physical space, so I have had the warning  to let me know I am reaching a wall.This has been a slight loss in my experience and it seems that each game is different. However, as a general rule, the PC version of VR seem to give more freedom of movement whereas the PSVR limits this but makes it a better headset for limited space.Now the touch controllers are fantastic and very easy to use. I love the fact that the top edges and triggers are touch sensitive and know when your fingers are off them allowing you to raise a thumb or point a finger or make a closed fist. They are very responsive and track very well, even when I have completely turned around, which I find I am able to do far more with Oculus. I often forget which way I am facing and yet the tracking still seems to work well.Now, the comfort of the headset... I wondered if the strap was going to be too tight and give me a VR mark around my face, but no problems as long as you don't over tighten the straps. I actually found that having loooser straps made the fit more comfortable and stilll held the headset in place. It is also lighter than the PSVR headset which has a band that tightens onto your head and then the headset slides up to your face. So different approaches but both seem to work well.Finally, when your headset is not in use, put it back in the sturdy box that the headset arrived in. I keep mine plugged into the PC and put the headset and extra cable into the box, close the lid with the cable out of the side and lay it alongside my PC. This will keep the dust from my VR headset and protect it from unwanted knocks or bangs.

An sich ist das Gerät genial, ich habe richtig meinen Spass damit, jedoch muss hier Oculus einiges nachbessern, aber eher beim Qualitätscheck und dem Support als wirklich bei der Technik....Erste Brille kam mit einem ""Klebefleck"" hinter der linse auf der Linken seite, funktionierte zwar trotzdem, jedoch für das Geld nicht einzusehen. Also Nachbestellung angefordert.Nachbestellung angekommen, hier nun auch auf BEIDEN seiten Klebereste hinter der linse, auch wenn diese nicht so Stark waren. (Oder Beschädigung, keine Ahnung, zumindest auch nicht hinnehmbar)Jedoch nun zum (meiner Meinung nach) krassen an der Sache...Beim Direkt-Vergleich zwischen beiden Brillen war bei der ersten eine gewisse Farbunechtheit festzustellen, außerdem war das Tracking schlechter als bei der Nachlieferung, wie kann sowas bitte vorkommen?! Wären die Linsen okay gewesen und ohne direkten vergleich hätte ich es nie gemerkt, das ist aber einfach ein no-go weil bei sowas motion-sickness vorprogrammiert ist!Also mit Amazon und Oculus geschrieben, Amazon klasse reagiert, haben wohl ihr Lager überprüft, nach 2 Wochen nochmal nachgefragt und anscheinend gabs da wirklich eine schlechte Charge... weitere Packung geschickt bekommen und diese ist nun Perfekt ohne jegliche Beanstandung!Zum Oculus Support:Ich wollte zumindest ein Feedback abgeben, und trotz genauer Beschreibung und Bilder etc. habe ich erstmal eine Standard Mail bekommen das es der normale Verwischeffekt wäre, dann nach kurzem hin und her und Erklärung habe ich ein Video geschickt um zu verdeutlichen das es das definitiv nicht ist. Dann kam ein Software-Troubleshooting Guide wegen des Farbeffekts, was soll ich damit wenn's definitiv ein Hardware Defekt ist? Habe also freundlich zurückgeschrieben das ich bei der ersten Brille definitiv kein Softwaretroubleshooting durchführen werde wegen der Farb-Unechtheit, vor allem da ja im direkten Vergleich ohne Reboot etc. die neuere Brille genauso lief nur eben besser, sowie das ich das restliche mit dem Händler kläre. Danach kam dann eine Mail das man Verständnis dafür hätte und ich bitte noch einen Auszug aus meinem Kompatibilitätstool schicken soll. Warum denn? Reine Datensammlerei? Was hilfts bei einem eindeutigen Produktionsmangel?Ich behalte diese Brille da ich keine Lust habe 2 Jahre auf bessere Technik zu warten und diese einfach die beste vom P/L verhältnis ist, denn dafür ist sie wirklich klasse und macht wie gesagt einen Heiden Spaß auch wenn der Weg dafür jetzt lange war bis zum besten Erlebnis. Die Software benötigt auch noch einige Verbesserungen, aber ich denke das wird noch kommen.Also, Augen auf beim Oculus Kauf ;-)Edit: Habe noch ein paar Fotos angefügt das ihr seht worauf zu achten ist, das Bild ohne die roten Kreise bzw markierungen ist das wo man die makellose Linse sieht wie sie sein sollte.

I recommend that you check the Oculus rift compatibility tool before purchasing as unfortunately it's incompatible with many common usb 3.0 controllers. Here's some of the following incompatible ones:Etron USB 3.0 Extensible Host ControllerVIA USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller - 1.0 (Microsoft)ASMedia USB 3.0 eXtensible Host ControllerASMedia XHCI ControllerRenesas USB 3.0 eXtensible-HostcontrollerUnfortunately my usb controllers are Etron and as a result i'm having difficulty with my setup, i'm determined to make this work however and have purchased a USB 3.0 PCIE expansion: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00B6ZCNGM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1i'm short on space however and don't know if I'll be able to make this work as I'll also need a PCIE 1x extension as it's buried under my graphics card, failing that 'll upgrade my motherboard to experience the awesomeness of the rift.Long story short, save yourself a headache and check the compatibility tool first.Edit: The headset works on my current USB 3.0 ports while the sensors throw back errors and point blank refuse, I've had to connext these to USB 2.0 ports until I upgrade my motherboard.While this is working well even with the sensors on usb 2.0 I feel the experience would undoubtedly be smoother on usb 3.0 and I look forward to testing the difference. Will update this review once new motherboard installed.Update:My new motherboard and usb 3.0 pcie card has been installed and the Oculus Rift is running like a dream, absolutely brilliant experience. The lenses on the headset and my own glasses do tend to fog up a bit during play which can be irritating but you can take care of this with any number of anti-fog solutions. Personally I'm using Cat Crap.I've upgraded my initial review from 3 stars to 4 stars. While the Oculus is amazingly fun the fogging on the lenses and incompatibility with some of the most common USB 3.0 controllers around means it's a step away from being a perfect 5 stars. I suspect that in future the oculus will go through software revisions and design revisions to alleviate these issues.

I have never used a vr headset before and was not sure if itvwoukd be any good. I went by the reviews which are mostly positive. Got to say, I was gobsmacked when I tried this for the first time . The word immersive does not do it justice. It is like being teleported into the game. I have a mid spec gaming pc, core i5 with a 1060 graphics card and all games are very smooth. The rift comes in premium packaging and is lightweight on the face. The controllers are amazing and gives a very natural interaction with the game environment. The first game I tried was no limits roller coaster, incredibly realistic although don't try it on a full stomach. Vol flight sim was just like being in a plane cockpit. Lots of the shorter experience type games are free. Agree with many reviewers that the headphones are great quality. However, having only games in hd I was also impressed with image quality which looks as good as  hd to me. I tgink this is the most amazing piece of tech I have ever tried, and will only grow better as more titles are released. Simply awesome!

Started with the Oculus DK2 ,two reasons ,1st to see if i would get dizzy or feel sick using it and second save money if i did .While the DK2 is an utter mind blowing experience, the consumer oculus rift CV1 with touch is mind blowing +++ .The optics are far better albeit slight distortion from the revamped fresnal lens which causes slight flare from white on black background .The touch brings your hands into the game ,a real must for games .It is a lighter weight than the DK2 and much more comfy on the head ,the earphones work fine and sound great .If you want to get into VR and not sure about the price/feeling sick ,get a DK2 for a few weeks and see what happens before the big buy on this but all i can say is ""Fantastic product and utter out of this world"" .Just to let you know ,im 52 years old and love this.

Absolutely amazing product. I bought the playstation VR when it was released. The lack of games and their prices made me buy Oculus when it became cheaper. I can not be happier, it was the right decision. Compared to this one, PSVR is just a toy.If you like flight simulators then you will need one of this. You feel literally like you are inside the cockpit. Actually you will feel teleported to another world.The setup is fairly easy, but I would recommend this to people who have at least a basic knowledge in computing and only to people who like gaming. Most of the negative reviews I saw are because of the lack of knowledge of the users. I didn't have any problems with the setup or the hardware itself, but If you do, just try to google for an answer.

VR is the future, its still missing the one killer app but I am sure we will get that soon.I have had various VR headsets, DK2, Gear VR, PSVR and now this. All I can say is this is by far the best. Its so easy to set up (You may need to update a few of your drivers, Graphics card, audio etc. Also your USB 3.0 drivers (Although the Rift software warned me it needed updating)).This £399 bundle does not have the Xbox one controller or the Rock band VR attachment for the guitar. I thought they did but on reading the description I was mistaken.

To start with, my overall opinion is very positive, in fact its better than i thought it would be, games like robot recall are stupidly impressive and immersive.Pros:Very responsive tracking, the fact you can wander around a virtual environment on foot is just awsome as is the ability to duck and dodge.Hardly any screendooring.The hand controllers are really well done, using them becomes second nature very quickly.The gfx in most games are extrordinary good, your senses are fooled by the immersion. Try the app where you fall off a skyscraper, i guarentee you will get a sinking feeling then flinch as you hit the ground.The headset itself is very comfortable to wear and easy to adjust.Sound quality through the earpieces is suprisingly good (although see below).Cons:On my unit the sound cuts out on the left headphone every now and then, flicking it a few times fixes it. Dont know if its a sensor issue or my unit has a loose wire but its not serious enough to send it back.Although the setup app is really well done, there could be more detailed instructions in the box to get you started, theres liturally 1 note saying go to this website and nothing else.So overall, i love this product and look forward to whatever vr developments lie ahead.

I was there is the 70's when Space Invaders hit the local chippy. I was there when Dragon' lair appeared in 83 in the arcades. I've owned every games console and computer since the VCS. There have been some fantastic breakthroughs across the years and this is one of those moments. Trying Occulus vr for the first time is simply breathtaking. The fluidity of movement and most of all the ability to hold your hands out and pick thems up and manipulate them in the virtual world is something that even after owning this thing for 6 weeks or so still amazes me.Like any new technology there are a few issues that i have with the device. The main one is that I can only play in 20 minute sessions as it can make you feel a bit ill in some experiences. I feel that the second issue of the user getting quite hot when wearing the headset contributes to this but i suspect having a fan in front of you when playing would help considerably. I should say that i only really experience motion sickness in games where you are floating and have no fixed position to relate to such as a car dashboard. In driving games i can play for much longer (1hr +).A great bit of kit.

Not going to write a long review as it's time I'd rather spend in the vr world with the rift!!  It's simply amazing. Social aspect of this game is incredible too as it has built in mic and headphones. I didn't realise this at first until someone in a game I was in started talking to me and helping me through the game! Which was an experience in itself as the guy was moving his arms and hands as some people do when they talk and this was shown in-game with his character thanks to the excellent motion tracking of the controllers.If you've clicked reviews to see what people are saying...then you're already interested enough to buy one! You need no more justification trust me! It's worth every penny!I'm currently playing this on a gtx780 graphics card which is a good 4-5 years and it still runs very smoothly on this!  Which surprised me but nice to see.

I'm 46 years old and rarely get exited by new technology now. Everything nowadays is a small step forward rather than something completley new. I have been through computing ages from owning a ZX81 computer, having no internet or mobile phone, and being able to choose from only 3 channels (yes 3) on TV, but I can honestly say that the vr headsets (oculus & vive) are a major jump forward rarely seen in technology and it's a pity these companies haven't been out demoing their headsets as you have to use one to truly appreciate how good they are.

I'm a Vive owner and bought this for comparison for my business.The Vive is great, but Oculus is almost identical but far more comfortable and so much cheaper. I bought a third sensor which makes tracking almost the same as the Vive, still way cheaper. Many games for rift after really good and run better with the touch controllers, which are also really great. I now prefer the rift and use it all the time because of the comfort. Considering selling the Vive.

Bought the bundle on sale for £349. Worked flawlessly first time after setup.Here's the lowdown: Running a fully updated Windows 10 x64 with the Fall Creator's Update, the latest 388.71 drivers for the Nvidia 980ti, the latest bios and drivers for the motherboard, Asus Z170 Pro Gaming, also the latest firmware and drivers for the 3rd party onboard USB 3.0 controller from Asmedia.First I made an account on the Oculus site, then downloaded and installed the Oculus Home software, turned off the PC, connected the sensors to the Intel USB 3.0 ports, there are four in a row so I used the left most port for one sensor and the right most port for the second, this is apparently the best way to connect them, since it puts them on separate controllers. Then I connected the headset lead to the HDMI port on the 980ti and the headsets USB lead to the Asmedia USB 3.0 port, again to make sure in was on a different controller. This apparently ensures that any one controller doesn't get flooded and overrun with data.Turned the PC back on and waited for a minute or two for Windows to finish doing it's thing of detecting the new hardware in the background, then ran Oculus Home software, the software ran and recognised I'd connected the hardware and started going through the set procedure, I'd placed the sensors to my front left and rear right facing each other diagonally about ten feet apart as suggested for the experimental 360 setup, everything went smoothly and setup was done in about 5 mins and then I was in and playing the First Contact tutorial demo. No issues.I'm very impressed overall with The Rift, the tracking works very well when setup right and games looks much better than I was expecting, the sense of depth and immersion is really quite incredible. There are one or two annoyances, the God Rays, this is when you have something bright in the foreground against a darker background, you get streaks of light coming from the brighter object, which can be distracting but overall it doesn't happen often and you start to eventually tune it out anyway unless it's really bad. 2nd the headset can be a bit of a pain to get just right, if the straps and lens spacing aren't absolutely spot on then the image will be blurry, the difference between sharp and blurry can be just a matter of a couple of millimeters, this is especially true for the position of the headset on your face with regards to how high or low you have it. Getting it just right also helps alleviate the god ray effect. It's also tempting to put it on really tight, but I find if it's too tight and close to your face, it's becomes uncomfortable fast and makes the god rays worse, there appears to be an optimal distance that makes the god ray problem a minimal annoyance.In summary, an awesome experience so far and worth every penny.

Ich habe seit der Veröffentlichung der Rift mit einem Kauf geliebäugelt aber die Sache war mir einfach zu teuer. Den entsprechenden PC hatte ich war aber einfach nicht bereit über 600€ für diese Brille auszugeben wo man doch ab und an wieder von Dingen wie Fliegengittereffekt, eingeschränktes Sichtfeld usw. las.Jetzt kurz vor Weihnachten waren ja alle diese Preissenkungen und dann war da im Amazon Warehouse eine Rift inkl. Touch Controller für 355€ und da konnte ich nicht mehr anders als zuzuschlagen.Das Gerät kam hier im ungeöffneten Original Karton an, alle Klebebänder und Linsenschutz-Aufkleber waren noch drauf, also gehe ich davon aus eine nagelneue Rift bekommen zu haben. Allerdings ist der rechte Köpfhörer ""defekt"" bzw. hat einen Wackelkontakt, was lt. Internet-Foren eine Art Serienfehler ist und von Oculus problemlos als Tauschgrund anerkannt wird. Wenn man weiß wie man damit umgehen muss funktioniert es ohne Probleme und ist im Moment kein Grund für mich die Brille zum Tausch einzuschicken, habe ja noch einige Zeit Garantie drauf.Der erste Eindruck und das erste Erlebnis mit der Brille war: WOW !!!  Der ""First Contact"" der Touch Controller - also das Minispiel mit dem Roboter auf dem Holodeck ... wie geil ist das denn? Der Hammer! Die Immersion ist so dermaßen gut gelungen, man fühlt sich wirklich mittendrin. Auch Robo Recal usw. echt klasse und jeden Cent wert!Klar, wenn man sich mal die Zeit nimmt und alles ganz genau anschaut sieht man das Fliegengitter, auch der ""Blick durch die Taucherbrille"" fällt auf - aber hey, das ist alles nichts gegen dieses hineinziehen in die Spielewelt.Egal ob es der Rennwagen in Project Cars, RaceRoom oder Assetto Corsa ist - dieses mitten drin sein ist Weltklasse! Hier merkt man dann auch ob der PC ""nur"" den Anforderungen der Rift entspricht oder ob man noch ein bisschen Reserven an Leistung hat. Project Cars 2 braucht schon richtig Rechenpower von CPU und GPU.Wie geschrieben, ich habe den Kauf absolut  nicht bereut und würde es jeder Zeit wieder tun! Wie geil wird das erst wenn die nächste Generation von VR Brillen kommt... ich kann's kaum abwarten, aber bis dahin spiele ich noch gerne ein paar Runden in PC2 ;-)Viele GrüßeHolger

I'm not a wealthy person, but I thought VR would be good enough to warrant the £400.I was wrong, it's FAR FAR better than I imagined it would be. The resolution is much higher than I felt I had been led to believe (by hearing other people talk about it). I'm on a 970 and everything looks amazing. Textures are cleaner than I could have dreamt.Using the Rift is the greatest thing I've experienced in 30+ years of gaming. This thing is phenomenal.

Fantastic peice of kit that transforms your room into another living breathing world. The sensors pick up just about every bit of movement which was the part I was sceptical about you aim a gun and it hits where you aim simple !!!The other part of the headset and experience comes from the amazing headphones I personally can't believe how good they are. I've played a couple of games which were Apollo 11 and Arktika.1One was the amazing Apollo moon landing that puts you right in the centre of it all which is a fantastic experience and Arktika.1 is (almost) my perfect game , the games shooting mechanics are what I've always wanted to experience in a game, and i cannot imagine  that they have actually nailed this it's literally like being in an actual shoot out, hiding behind cover with decent AI flanking you then popping out shooting back is amazing, the guns and environments are also brilliant i can't recommend this game enough.I bought an Xbox one x 2 weeks ago and after buying the Oculus Rift Ive not used the Xbox one X since!!!One piece of advice is if to are skeptical go and try one if yo can and have a go on one but I assure you that to will wish you had bought a Rift ages ago.I can't wait for what the future holds for VR and I am IN for the long haul.

Was a little sceptical initially as thought it might be a fad thing, but after seeing plenty of reviews and the Rift dropping in price a lot I thought I'd treat myself for xmas, so glad I did.Just like all the reviews said, without playing it yourself its hard to explain just how good it is.Its a crazy experience, some of the games Ive really enjoyed are Google earth VR (which is free aswell) Epic Rollercoasters (although after a while I feel a bit quessy due to the fast motion), Luckys Tale (Free with the rift), Cmoar Cinema (its like sitting in a cinema watching your movies, amazing), Pinball FX2 VR and Retro Neon Arcade.I bought some cheap USB and HDMI extenders so im not limited in movement and also a 3.0 usb hub aswell, I also intend on buying another sensor for behind me aswell, but thats not a must buy right now.I did have a slight issue getting the sensors set up, but that was due to my small playing space, which I do intend to sort out soon but as for now its all set up and can happily play in the small space I have.Would I recommend the rift? Most definitely and I can only see more development from software companies in the future, so if you were like me and just trying to decide I'd say take the plunge you'll love it!!

Absolutely blown away with this product. Very easy to set up and get going. Also pleasantly surprised by the lack of cable mess. The touch controllers are also amazing.My only negative that's stops it being 5 stars would be that I can see some like coming in from the bottom of the head set where the space is for my nose. Also it can be hard to focus as you can only change the lens spacing. You also have to move the head set up and down on your head to adjust but this is all part of the setup.I felt a bit of buyers guilt after spending £400 on this but can honestly say 10 minutes into playing this that was totally gone.

Since the price came down to ~£400, this is now actually a worthy alternative to the Vive. While the Vive is still better, this offers pretty much the same experience, just on a budget. The tracking can be a little iffy at times, and I only have a small playspace so I'm not one to comment on how good the room-scale is, but overall it works great and offers exactly what I wanted from VR. To be honest I prefer the Touch controllers over the Vive ones, too.

Yes I love it but, it was a bit a an Ass to set up.  I got there in the end but only after starting again after digesting a lot of advice from various forums.  In reality, the set up is simple, when it works first time, and I think for most people it does.For anyone reading this, make sure your graphics drivers are up to date.  Install a copy of the Oculus tool tray which is a free app that gives you a few extra settings to play with  Check your anti virus hasn't decided it does not like it. Don't put your headset usb into a powered port and if it does not work correctly first time, just calmly start again :)One more thing ...if you are trying to play games purchased from steam, remember to click the option in settings that allows you to play software oculus does not ""approve of""- amused me a lot that one.When it finally works perfectly its very worth it..

Just thought id share my initial impression of the rift as it only arrived yesterday. I also own PSVR and to be honest despite having that VR wow factor there are too many things wrong about it for me to have an enjoyable experience so its basically been gathering dust for the last couple of months. Oculus is a whole new ball game.Initial impressions are good, upon opening the box it just has a premium feel. and its very easy to put everything back in for portability. So I went about setting the machine up with my I7 1060 laptop. And it couldn't be easier, just go to website and follow a very easy tutorial and a few minutes later your good to go.All I can say is for me this leaves PSVR in the dust. Everything is just right!Headset is very comfortable and easy to set, One of the biggest problems I had with PSVR was light leaking in where my nose was and id literally have to jam my face as far into the headset as possible to get darkness and the sweet spot for clarity. None of this with the rift, it just fits perfectly so no light and sweet spot is very easy to achieve.Resolution is great and isn't as misty as PSVR but be aware at the current time none of the headsets have super pin sharp visuals, but at the moment this is as good as it gets and after a wee while you no longer notice.Tracking is superb, another issue I had with PSVR was that the tracking would drift. this would completely destroy immersion as I had to correct the controller position which would start to rotate to the left. Oculus is just spot on, its like having a second pair of hands.Lastly id like to mention how good the headphones and sound are, its so much better having them on the side of the headset, psvr makes you attach yet another wire to the mess of wires you already have and means your constantly untangling wires.And this is the crux of the matter, PSVR compromises trying to squeeze VR into existing peripherals. The Oculus is designed for VR and the touch controllers are a game changer It really is like having real hands.So bottom line is if you have a powerful enough pc don't hesitate just grab this as at this price its about the same as a PSVR and your getting a much better experience. And you`ll never forget the first time you open your eyes in a vr world and realise this is the future of gaming.VR will improve with things like eye tracking, higher screen resolution and wireless connections in the future but that's at least a couple of years away. So jump on in :)

Can't describe how good this is.The little picky things people complain about. Like the screen door effect and the god rays, are just picky. Get in a game and you don't notice. It's like looking for a particular detail on a painting. It doesn't matter compared to the bigger picture.Comfort is good very adjustable straps fits perfectlyTracking is very good. Can only compare this to PSVR and not a HTC vive, however this doesn't lose tracking. Unless you turn your back to the sensors and they can no longer see your motion controls. Headset has a tracking triangle on the back so stays tracked.The controllers themselves. Are fantastic. Very very comfortable buttons are all in the right places, easily found and work flawlessly.The price.. worth every penny!If you have the PC and your considering buying one. Just get it. You won't be disappointed!

So I took the plunge and purchased this bundle during the £399 summer sale and I have to say I am really pleased with my purchase and the massive discount. At full price (£499) it is still worth the cost though.If you are an advid PC gamer like me you will really enjoy getting into VR. It's unlike any other innovation in PC gaming. Offering a whole new experience.I was worried that the lower resolution would bother me as I had tried the PSVR before which has no comparison to RIFT really. The image quality is significantly better on the RIFT and can even be improved with super sampling if your rig can handle it.I would advise picking up some wall brackets/clips to get the sensors up high, they work much better when totally stable and you wont have to run the sensor setup everytime you nudge a sensor on your desk.If you like me you have a limited play area and 360° gaming is not really an option, there are still plenty of games to play so don't worry about that.Currently there are not enough substantial games for the RIFT but it's getting better and there are some definite must buys out there now.Highly recommended. The next RIFT/VIVE is likely 2+ years away so don't wait on them, just go for it!

I’ve had this now for a couple of months. I run it on a very good PC (1000W psu, core i7, 16 Gb DDR4 3000 RAM, GTX1080 Ti graphics card). The VR experience is just awesome - even once the initial ‘wow’ factor subsides it is incredible fun. I play some games in VR and others is normal desktop mode. The bundled game - robo recall is very well designed and huge fun. Elite Dangerous Horizons is great fun in VR too. If you have a PC that’s up to the job I would thoroughly recommend the rift.

Having spent around six months contemplating the pros and cons of delving into VR, I finally took the plunge with the Oculus Rift. I spent time reading lots of articles comparing it to the HTC Vive and other VR devices, and watching YouTube videos of owner reviews. Having experienced it for myself now, one question comes to mind: Why didn't I get it sooner?!Let's face it, there are only REALLY two main competitors out there when it comes to experiencing VR on your home PC. Oculus or HTC. And the one thing i've learned during my six months of contemplation is that there are a lot of people who believe that one is ""better"" than the other. much like the age-old Android/Apple smartphone debate.Ultimately, the specs between the Oculus and the HTC are very much the same, but each device has it's own merits and demerits, as does everything these days.So, why did I go for the Rift? Well, a BIG deciding factor was the price difference between it and the Vive. Aside from the additional tracking sensors and a camera for the chaperone system on the Vive, I really didn't see how it could possibly cost £200 more than the Rift. The additional sensors apparently make for a much better room-scale VR experience, but since I live in a tiny studio flat and only intend to use VR for standing or seated experiences, the Rift is better geared for that out-of-the-box, whereas the Vive would have been overkill for my personal needs, requirements and limitations. Also, the Oculus Touch bundle seemed to offer excellent value for money since the headset package alone costs £80 more. Crazy!Regarding the controllers, it seems that the reviews I had read and watched favoured the Oculus Touch controllers over the Vive controllers, and understandably so. The Touch controllers are smaller and are a comfortable fit in the hand. The buttons, triggers and thumbsticks are naturally placed, and I love how the controller knows what position your fingers and thumbs are in, even if they're not touching any buttons. Each controller takes one AA battery (pack of 2 included in box), and it will last for around 30 hours of gameplay. That's a LOT of gameplay, with experienced owners saying they are replacing controller batteries every 2-3 months.Setup seems fairly straightforward, as long as you have a minimum of 3x3 feet of play area, so the sensors can do their job effectively. Incidentally, I read many reports of people having tracking issues with the Rift. I've not experienced any tracking issues at all so far, and it's had a lot of use over the last couple of weeks. The sensors have also been relocated twice while I was rearranging furniture and making more room, and still i've had no problems. (If, during the setup stage, the software tells you to continue setup in your headset, and you find the setup video continually looping the last few seconds, just restart your computer to solve this issue.)So onto the headset itself. I love the design. Its somewhat smaller and less ugly than the Vive. It's also reportedly lighter, making it more comfortable to wear for long periods. The adjustable straps are durable and comfortable, and the built-in headphones are unbelievably good for their size, and have such good clarity and wide frequency response, with crisp, clear highs and prominent lows. I was expecting to remove them on the first day so i could use my own headphones, but I haven't used any other headphones as yet. They really are that good!The display quality is as to be expected for current VR devices. VR is still in it's infancy, so it will likely still be a couple of years yet before we can expect to see HD resolution in these tiny displays. That said, what i've experienced so far is still nothing short of absolutely mind blowing! Yes you can see individual pixels, but only really if you're thinking about them. Once you're drawn into a VR video or game, you won't be thinking about it. You'll be lost in the immersion of 360 sights and surround sound. I'm using my unit a lot on flight sims, and while cockpit/instrument text can appear grainy, the overall immersive quality is breathtaking, giving you a real sense of height, speed and distance. I've heard that the Vive has a brighter display, but I do wonder HOW much brighter, since I personally wouldn't want the Rift display to be any brighter than it already is. To me, that would be uncomfortable and headache-inducing. Speaking of which, I haven't yet experienced headaches, sickness or dizziness as a result of VR alone. I did initially experience slight nausea the first time I went into a flight sim in VR, but that's something i've gotten used to. Everyone will have their own tolerances and sensitivities, so I would recommend trying out VR first if you've never experienced it, so you can gain some idea of how it might affect you, as well as what it can offer in terms of enjoyment. Lastly, i've heard people complaining about the heat from the headset. At this point i'm lost, because I haven't felt any real heat from the unit. It gets a little warm, but only a bit. It's barely noticeable.I don't know what the microphone quality is like as I haven't used it yet, but the sheer fact that a built-in mic, headphones AND the display itself all runs through a single trailing cable as opposed to the multiple cables on the Vive was another deciding factor for me.The trailing cable from the headset is around 12 feet long, and while it's not really suitable for room scale VR gaming, I am led to believe you can use extension cables up to 16 feet to allow extra freedom of movement. You may want to clarify this prior to purchase, if cable length is a concern to you. The cable terminates into two ""tails"". One for HDMI connection (which needs to be connected to your graphics card HDMI socket, NOT the motherboard HDMI socket), and a USB 3.0 connection.Both sensors also have USB 3.0 connectivity. Oculus say that both should be connected to USB 3.0 sockets, but subsequent sensors can be connected via USB 2.0. I have one sensor connected to USB 3.0, and the other connected to USB 2.0, and they are both working fine. The setup software even acknowledges and accepts these connections.Finally, there are many places advertising spare parts and accessories for the Rift. It seems most of these items are not readily available through online retailers though, at least not here in the UK. Personally, i'm not worried about that, but if it's readily available parts and accessories you're after, you might want to consider the Vive.I definitely feel I made the right choice with the Rift, and don't regret my purchase one bit. I think if I had spent the extra on the Vive, I would be grossly disappointed. I'm more than happy with my experience so far, and I hope there is more to look forward to in due course.If, like me, you've been wasting time debating this purchase, and you can afford it, hit that buy button! I can't recommend it enough!

It is difficult to explain how great this is if you have never tried it.  The level of immersion is amazing and using the touch controllers really adds to the experience.  If you are thinking of buying a vr system then buy it. Even my hard to impress 14 year old thinks it's 'awesome' and has invited his friends over to show of 'his' vr system.I waited to buy this and wish I hadn't and just got it ages ago.

This is my second time trying VR, first time I sold my Oculus as I just didn't have the time to use it, this time around I have a little more time, so glad I gave it another go, that ASW really makes a huge difference, not only does it lower the minimum specs but also allows you to run with higher settings if you have the recommended spec or above, I am using much higher settings in Elite Dangerous than I was last year with no perceptible hit in frame rate, I know there must be a drop in actual frame rate but ASW does such a superb job of hiding it, outstanding.

I am a newbie to Virtual Reality technology as I write this review.  So you can understand when I say, oh my goodness!  This product is amazing!  I am a big fan of the Elite Dangerous (Horizons) game and play it quite constantly.  I do get motion sickness on some games such as Project Cars, which is freaky as I am sitting down not moving.  Within one day I found the sound stopped working in the left ear of the headphones.  However the screwdriver that comes in the pack fixed this in a couple of minutes, and I have already bought the in-ear headphones as I prefer them.  I love the product and well worth the price I think.  Thank you Oculus.

It's impossible to go back to a flat screen for sim racing now.  Once you've blasted an Evo around Wales in Dirt Rally over undulating hills there is simply no going back.

Purchased during the 'summer special'. I now understand why people use words like 'awesome'. Videos such as 'The Blue'  certainly demonstrate its capability (you feel immersed as though you are there) and games that were designed for the Rift like Elite Dangerous are great. The only downsides I have found are the 'screen door' effect (you are looking at a high res screen but as it encompasses your whole field of view the pixels are noticeable); the lack of available software (hopefully in time more may become available); and of course the fact that you can no longer see your mouse/keyboard when gameplaying (to a large extent I overcome this by a mixture of voice commands and HOTAS controls). I do usually wear glasses but found the headset was OK without them; frankly I think it would be very difficult and cumbersome to wear them within the headset (but I did find a third party offering lenses that clip inside the Rift). I found the Rift straightforwards to set up, the headset adequate and overall the experience impressive. Of course it would be nicer to be free of the cables and to have a higher resolution but probably some way off for those!

I am not a gamer, more of an outdoors kind of person, I like to travel, I actively play sports 5 days per week. I bought this out of curiosity and, of course, after having read all these raving reviews. Conclusion, add all the reviews up, they are all true, I am not able to add anything else to praise this thing even more. Unique experience, unlike any other I've ever had gaming or otherwise. The same goes for my wife, my 8 year old daughter (she can play without wearing her glasses) and 6 year old son. Children need the straps adjusted properly and, depending on their age, shouldn't be left with the headset on for a long time (no more than 30 minutes before you really check if they are ok) as, for them, the headset feels heavy. I have the 360 degree setup of the 2 sensors, it works well unless you get some into some strange position while playing Robo Recall. For this game alone, I have already ordered a 3rd sensor. I haven't played much, not as much as I want, unfortunately I don't have time for that. Even so, I would buy it again without a second thought. It is an experience worth having in your life... just like having _ex ;)2-months update: The experience keeps getting better and better! The 3rd sensor setup eliminated any problems that used to occur with the 2-sensor setup. It is not an easy task though and any movement of the sensors changes the playable area border. There are good online guides on the optimal setup worth looking up.Some beginner tips.Tip 1: For the sweaty forehead, you can wear a headband. Tip 2: For not tripping over the cable, fix it on your waist line, behind you. Any simple clip works.Tip 3: If you have the sensors on their original base (eg sitting on your desk), you could buy non-slip/sticky pads to keep them in place from minor, accidental movements. Tip 4: Many more games playable on the Rift are available on Steam. The playable area on Steam is a bit different, you might get 2 ""borders"". In that case, turn off the Rift ones from the Rift's settings. Tip 5: Spend time experimenting with the straps, the tilt, the between eyes distance, the position the headset rests on your head. It can eliminate both blurring and discomfort. Tip 6: Clear your schedule, make time or you are going to lose your sleep :)2.5 years update: Besides family, most of our friends with their children have tried the headset. We call it an ""Oculus visit"" :) The only problem hardware wise has been a loose screw on the headphone that caused intermittent sound cuts. I have already ordered the Quest but I am planning on keeping the Rift as well so that 2 persons can play together in the house. Favorite/most played games: Beat saber, thrill of the fight, eleven table tennis vr, google earth vr, darth vader immortal and toy box (kids' favourite).

Ich hatte bereits das vergnügen mehrere VR Systeme ausprobieren zu können.Mein Fazit zu dieser und anderen Brillen ist wie Folgt:1. Oculus Rift2. Htc Vive3. Rest...Bevor sich einige Fragen warum ich nicht die Vive an erster Stelle gewählt habe ist erklärbar damit dass nach meiner Sicht für den Konsumer kein besseres Headset zur Zeit auf dem Markt verfügbar ist.Die Oculus Rift hat den Komfort und die Super optimierten Spiele welche für so viel Immersion beitragen dass keine der anderen Headset ihr das Wasser im Consumer Bereich reichen können.Was man aber bedenken sollte wenn man sich eine Rift anschafft sind die Mehrkosten welche noch für einen 3. Sensor und die entsprechenden aktiven usb und hdmi kabel anfallen. Erst dies macht die Rift in meinen Augen optimal genießbar (natürlich mit entsprechendem Platzangebot).Um noch auf die Bedienbarkeit zu sprechen zu kommen. Ich habe grosse Hände womit mir eigentlich die Controller der VIVE besser gefallen müssten, jedoch aufgrund des groben handlings niemals so immersiv sind wie diejenigen der Rift welche sich perfekt in die Hand einschmiegen und diese nicht in ihrer Fähigkeiten einschränkt.Seid Euch bewusst, dass nach den ersten paar längeren Spielsessions mit diesen Controllern das Gefühl für eure normalen Hände abhanden kommt. Das ist eine Lustige Erfahrung die man auf jeden Fall gemacht haben muss.Den realen Preis für mein Setup nach kauf des Zubehörs (ohne Berücksichtigung des entsprechenden PCs) beläuft sich eher gegen die 580€ sofern man die Brille im Weinachtssale für 400€ gekauft hat.Ich Bereue meine Investition jedoch keinesfalls und würde sie Jedem Spieleinteressierten weiterempfehlen der Wert auf Bedienbarkeit und Komfort als auch auf optimierte Erfahrungen legt.

When a friend posted online that he had bought one of those, I was surprised - I thought these were expensive? Didn't they require a high-end PC? After doing some research, including using Oculus's own compatibility check tool on their website, I found my 5-year old PC was plenty capable of handling VR (though I did upgrade the video card a couple of years ago to an NVIDIA GTX 1070).I'll just get this out of the way: it's hard to describe what it's like to use one of these. I've used other VR stuff, like Google Cardboard, and this is something completely different. This can trigger things like motion sickness and fear of heights. I've nearly leaned on VR surfaces for balance. Some games place you on top of mountains, which can just be overwhelming. Not everything looks 100% real, but most of it is ""good enough"" to trick my brain.There are a lot of free games and demos, as well as high-quality paid apps, so there's no shortage of software available. It even comes with a few games, though Robo Recall is definitely the standout title (First Contact is also awesome!). Most of what's available on Steam is compatible, too. I'm having a lot of fun with the Oculus Rift, and I'm really glad I bought this.Other things I should mention:- Although the price was half of what I thought it'd be, it was still significant - from the packaging, it seems like they're trying to pitch this as a game console, which makes sense to me.- The setup process was difficult, and I've had to go through it a few times as I've adjusted the sensors. Installing the drivers was non-obvious, and I ended up searching online for a solution - which involved digging through the application directories and running .exe files directly from Windows Explorer. There's a lot of room for improvement here.- The lenses inside of the headset get dirty easily - my hair sometimes drags on the lenses when removing the headset. It doesn't help that the setup process has you alternate between using a mouse/keyboard on the computer screen, and putting on the headset and using the controllers. I've tried using the included cleaning cloth, but it hasn't really helped.- The controllers use AA batteries, which are included. After about 3 weeks, they died - despite not receiving a lot of usage within the past two weeks (due to travel and a work project demanding my time). I might switch to rechargeable batteries.- The battery doors on the controllers are held in by magnets, which was a really neat touch! However, they could use a an arrow (or something) to indicate how to remove the batteries. I had to search online for the exact place you need to press to remove the battery door.- I know it's not designed to be usable while wearing glasses, but it's tough to use while wearing glasses. My girlfriend is nearly blind without hers, so she hasn't been able to play very much.Additional things you should consider buying to accompany the Oculus Rift:- A third Oculus Sensor. I bought mine as a bundle on Amazon, which really helped.- HDMI and USB extension cables for the headset. Otherwise, you risk damaging your computer and/or the headset if you stray too far from your PC.- Does your video card have two HDMI ports? This wasn't obvious to me before purchasing the headset, but some games won't function properly unless your headset and your monitor are plugged into the same video card (using your motherboard's onboard video card in conjunction won't work). Since my NVIDIA GTX 1070 only had one HDMI port, which I had to use for the headset, I bought a DisplayPort to HDMI cable to connect my TV to the video card as well. It's not possible to know which games require this setup until you actually try to launch them, so I'd recommend looking into this before buying an Oculus Rift for yourself.Overall, totally worth it. This feels like the future!

Goaded on by the £399.00 offer price and after years of waiting to dip my toe into the solitary world of Virtual Reality! I took the plunge last month! The experience was truly breath taking after building a super rig to use the Oculus touch bundle. Being freaked out by heights and being thrust on top of a tumbling crane about 400 feet up off the ground and being completely paralysed with fear at the graphics. I had to laugh afterwards realising I was just stood on my living room carpet, but the visuals and the sound take you too that place of danger, and as much as your head knows you are safe. The stunning re-creations of some locations will simply not let your eyes or brain get away from that primal fear of heights or danger. (There is a whole other tale about being jettisoned into outer space after tumbling out of the relative safety of a space station, but that's another story!) So worth the money? Absolutely! If you have even a modicum of interest in VR and have a fairly decent system to handle the graphics, then go for it!Still a lot of trash on the games front, but this is new tech and you can slowly see some quality gaming rising to the surface. It is the future without a doubt and One hell of an experience.

The oculus rift came very well packed but the tape they use leaves a sticky glue on the cloth part of the headset.The oculus rift takes you to another world and does it well but unfortunately the god rays on some headsets are worse than others from what I have read and this was the case with mine ,it was terrible and it just spoils the experience .I also had problems with head tracking and the headset just freezing up.After 6 hours of trying different things to resolve the freezing I gave up.I probably would have returned it due to the god rays alone.I had no such problems with the controllers and they where some of the best I have ever used.It’s a pity even though the resolution and lenses are not there yet this really is an immersive and fun experience.

Bought to play games and also develop VR applications. Much prefer this to the Vive for desktop applications. The Vive tended to hurt my neck after 30 minutes of on and off use but the Oculus has never been uncomfortable to wear. Sensors are accurate and versatile. I may buy an additional sensor to put behind the play area to stop my hands not being picked up if I block them with my body. Although the Vive sensors are much easier to use the Oculus sensors take up far less space and look much more professional

I wish everything came boxed like this.Got home and wired it all up, took me about an hour to get it sorted correctly. I had a few problems with being too close to the sensors, so gradually pushing them further back on my desk did the trick. The setup process is very good I found, with the Guardian system a must, unless  you want to punch various objects around you.. Like I totally didn't do..Once I was ready to rock n roll with VR, I played Robo Recall, this was my first time in VR game,  so as predicted I was worse than rubbish, but I found the tutorials easy to follow. They must know people apeiple would have been useless at the start.. So after 20 minutes and some swearing it started to come together.The Touch controllers are amazing, though clumsy at first. After you've had them in your hands and interact with them, it's like using any other controller. (I would recommend using the straps on them around your wrist, just in case you find yourself getting caught in the moment)Next thing to do was download Virtual Desktop from Steam, fired up some 360 videos and got lost in VR. Giggity.Overall I think I haven't really touched the surface with what VR can do (that and just sat there catching flys looking around at everything), I think VR is a glimpse into the future of gaming.Would definitely recommend Oculus Rift.

Une très bonne surprise avec l'oculus rift!Avoir cet équipement au quotidien est assez extraordinaire.Aujourd'hui j'ai du mal à jouer sur un ""écran plat"".J'ai testé tous les jeux gratuits livrés avec le produit et je vous conseille vivement Robot Recall. Il se passe très vite, mais reste l'exemple de l'interactivité et l'immersion possibles quand les développeurs de jeux se penchent serieusement sur un jeu VR.Il n'y a pas que les mini jeux, en effet, après 25 heures passées dans Fallout VR je ne me séparerais de l'oculus pour rien au monde. C'est une expérience très immérsive.Globalement le casque est confortable et facile à ajuster sur la tête grâce à 3 bandelettes scratch pas trop mal foutues. Les contrôleurs de l'oculus qui au départ de par leur look ont instauré la méfiance sont en fait des éléments très bien pensés, qui permettent d'émuler au mieux une main virtuelle.Le tracking de la tête est parfait, il n'y a pas la moindre latence et les couleurs des écrans du casque sont vives et assez contrastées.Quelques bémols qui coûtent à ce produit une étoile :- La résolution (HD dans chaque oeuil), qui reste insuffisante vu que votre champ de vision est néttement supérieur et ça fait pas assez de pixels pour la surface qu'occupe l'image sur votre rétine. Résultat : ne vous attendez pas à une image hyper nette. Les textes restent lisibles cependant.- On a encore la sensation de porter un masque de plongée, car même si l'oculus essaye de remplir votre champ de vision au mieux, vous voyez entre le cadre noir du casque autour de l'image.- Les mini-jeux tels que Robot Recall sont conçus pour être peu gourmands, les AAA tels que Fallout le sont beaucoup plus et votre PC devra se donner pas mal de peine pour afficher 2xHD à 90 FPS (car il faut 90FPS!). J'ai une AMD Fury nitro comme CG (un peu en dessous de la 1070 de chez NVIDIA), et avec beaucoup de peine et configuration j'arrive à jouer en qualité maximale (avec une résolution supérieure à celle des écrans oculus pour améliorer la netteté de l'image). Cependant il y a des utilisateurs qui ne sont pas satisfaits de leur expérience malgré une 1080 ou 1080ti donc pensez à prendre du temps pour la configuration.- Le cable traine dans les pattes et c'est problématique au début (ensuite on apprend). Vous avez tout de même la possibilité d'acheter un appareil à fixer au plafond pour éviter ce problème.Je ne pense pas que les problèmes que j'évoque (sauf celui du cable) pourront être réglés par un autre casque dans un futur proche :- une résolution supérieure vous obligerait à avoir un PC à 2000 euro minimum- pour améliorer encore le champ de vision il faudrait aussi ajouter des pixels donc même souciVoilà pour mon expérience.

There are no words to describe the sensaltion of VR. I've been gaming for over 40 years, arcade, games consoles (the 'Pong type) first gen home computters, all the way through to modern day PC and I've sen a few 'innovations', but this is a huge step forward. I bought it for Elite: Dangerous, which I used to play with TrackIR head tracking, which made it easier to play. Although all VR suffers from the 'screen door' effect, where it  looks as if you are playing with a fine mesh across your vision, it really isn't that noticerable for me. What is noticeable, and how, is ther change in ther scale of things. Where playing on a monitor, your play area is a 21"" to what ever your personal preference is for a monitor (27"" for me), the play area is 360 degrees in ALL directions. Approaching space stations in E:D is a joy to behhold,, they just grow out of all proportion and fill your vision. It's not only E:D that gives you this  sensation. I bought Skyrim VR (even though I had the vanilla and Special Editions) and it just makes you want to explore. If you go to the Oculus Store, there are a swathe of free games and a lot for less than a fiver. You will never be left weithout something to play. It an investment well worth going for.I'm writing this review late, as I've owned the Rift since November 2017 and it's now June 2018, but this is now relevant as my Rift developed a fault. The right had half of the inbuilt headset cut out. I got onto the Oculus homepage and raised a ticket. I also spoke of their Live Chat and the guy on there could not have been more helpful. He agreed after some troubleshooting that there was indeed a fault and arranged for a return label to be Emailed to me and the headset (only) was sent off to the Netherlands for replacement. Iit was away 4 days and I got an Email advising me the replacement was on its way back. In my eyes that is a pretty good service with no quibbling about whether they would do anything with it. A first rate service. Still Five Stars and still well worth the money.

Mir persönlich hat VR schon seit aufkommen der Developer Versionen DK 1 und DK 2 interessiert, allerdings hat mich der Preis bis dato immer abgeschreckt. Mehr durch Zufall (wenn man die massive Werbeaktion von Oculus so bezeichnen möchte :D ) habe ich von eben diesem Angebot erfahren und der Preis von 449€ inklusive der Touch Controller schien meiner Ansicht nach mehr als fair.Also zugeschlagen.Wie von Amazon gewohnt kam das Paket pünktlich und heile bei mir an.Das erste mal in der VR ist wirklich ein Erlebnis. Gerade die Einführung die man im Rahmen der Einrichtung der Oculus bekommt, hat bei mir direkt für ein tolles Gefühl der Virtuellen Umgebung und auch für so manchen Schmunzler gesorgt. (Stichwort süßer Roboter)Die kostenlosen Spiele die anfangs dabei sind, sind allemal sehr unterhaltsam, und Robo Recall im speziellen, hat bei mir schon für das ein oder andere durch geschwitzte T-Shirt gesorgt. Die Touch Controller sind unglaublich präzise und vermitteln einem tatsächlich das Gefühl von Händen im Spiel und ausgezeichneter Kontrolle.Die Immersion ist einfach der Hammer. Man ist einfach mitten drin. Es ist schwer zu beschreiben, wenn man es nicht selbst schon einmal ausprobiert hat.Zudem sei noch gesagt das Oculus seine Pforten geöffnet hat und weit mehr,vorher exklusive HTC Vive Spiele , nun auch problemlos mit der Oculus funktionieren. (Steam usw.)Alles in allem bin ich sehr zufrieden mit der Oculus und habe (auch dank so manchen kostenlosen Steam Spielen wie Lucky Night - Texas Holdem Poker) fast täglich Spaß mit diesem Stück Technik. Das Spieleangebot wächst derzeit wirklich stark an. Das größte Problem der Oculus ist meiner Ansicht nach allerdings noch die Auflösung. Zwar stört diese das Immersionsgefühl in den meisten Spielen nicht, fällt aber dennoch, gerade bei weiten Distanzen in der ""Ferne"" oft wirklich negativ auf. Aber gut, es ist ein Stück neue Technik und sie wird sich weiter Entwickeln. Wie immer.Jeder der Zuhause schon einen Rechner sein eigen nennen kann, welcher die Anforderungen von VR erfüllt (Steam bietet z. B. einen kostenlosen Test dafür an), und sich für VR interessiert, für den gebe ich auf jeden Fall eine klare Kaufempfehlung für die Oculus. Es ist einfach eine ganz andere Art zu spielen, zu erleben, oder zu lernen. 360 Grad 3D Videos, kleine Lern-Apps für die Geschichte der Luftfahrt, der Flug zum Mond, sich an die London Bridge setzen, oder einfach in Spielen rumballern, die Möglichkeiten sind grenzenlos.

Amazing, the next level of gaming and experiences.Playing games on a monitor is so out of date compared to this, imagine being in the game rather than watching it, where the enemy is the same size as you and the end of level boss is the size of a building, falling from a height gives the same feeling you get in a dream where you are falling, being in space, amongst dinosaurs or being in a haunted house all from the comfort of your own lounge.There is so much free stuff from steam and oculus that you will build a collection that you will want to invite everyone round to experience..

You won't read a website that doesn't sell this experience as being amazing. There are people who criticise the headset lenses - it's true that they do blur where there is a high contrast difference but most of the developers have factored this into their apps and games. If you want to watch / play games in HD/4K then buy a great monitor. If you want the most amazing VR experience then buy this! I had to contact support as Amazon sent me one that had been opened and already registered (a discount was given for this after a call to Amazon customer service). Oculus support sorted this out in about 6 hours (it was preventing the bundled games from being downloaded as they can only be given to first owner) - their tech support seems very good.

Yo había probado antes, el visor solamente sin controles, una demonen un expo, se veía bien.Ahora que lo probé en mi casa, es increíble, los touch son sorprendentes, de verdad te transporta a otro lugar.No te preocupes por comprar juegos, la librería gratuita de oculus es bastante entretenida. Puedes usar tu compu con los touch, sin mouse ni teclado, ver películas en modo cine.Si estás dudando en adquirirlo, pues vale la pena.Asegurate de tener 3 puertos usb 3.0 y un puerto Hdmi disponible. Todavía durará un buen rato vigente, después serán wireless como el htc vive pro ó 5k,8k como el Pimax. Desde una 1050ti lo puedes usar.Se recomienda un espacio de 2x1.5m  o donde puedas girar y agacharte sin chocar, de todos modos te avisa antes de chocar con algo.Las extensiones de cables no son necesarias, a menos que quieras personalizar el cableado de los sensores como ponerlos en alto sobre la pared. Pero en el escritorio funciona muy bien.

One could write pages on this device. But I won't. I had a problem with one of the sensors which has taken about a month to get towards a resolution. Oculus are sending me a new sensor. It needs a lot of time to set up properly. I only play one game and that has taken a good few hours to set up effectively. Having spent that time it is amazing. The resolution is lower than a 4k monitor would be, as expected but the 3D makes a space sim an incredible game. I have had no thoughts about playing in other than with the Oculus Rift. It is well worth the time it takes to get used to, despite the issues with the faulty sensor. I would certainly buy it again.

I've really enjoyed it. Oculus really put together a great package. It has everything you need to get going, even batteries for the touch sensors, ear phones and mic included. Setup is simple though it feels like it takes a long time when your eager to just plug and play (which you can get to with practice).The software interface is clean and informative, it's very Apple-esque.The intro 'game' is fab and really shows you what VR can do.It's worth taking the time to fit the head set properly - the angle you have the set on your head, the lens distance, how tight the straps are etc -  because some minor changes could make the difference between total immersion and blurry image.There are enough games to be getting on with, I highly recommend Lone Echo - movement is still something VR is working on but with a space game movement feels natural even if your not moving your legs much

OK, where to begin?  This is a beautifully made VR system, everything is packaged beautifully and the build quality is incredible. Setup is quick and easy, it takes you through all the tiny stages step-by-step with no rush.  The tutorial is jaw-dropping and you instantly get used to the touch controls.  Once you start playing games it really takes your breath away.  I started with Superhot and the accuracy of the control system and tracking was astonishing.  Every tiny movement was replicated on screen and the immersion was excellent.  Next up I played Project CARS 2.  Racing games will never be the same again.  The headset puts you into a natural 3D mode and you find yourself looking into the corner to find the apex on every turn which gives you a much better level of control than looking at the centre of a fixed screen.  The high frame rate meant that I didn't experience the nausea I encountered on the Playstation VR headset and after a 30 minute race i felt fine.  I found the navigation within the game a little confusing at first but when you work it out it is nothing short of sensational.  At less than £350 this is an absolute steal and once you have spent a little time with the Oculus you will never look at using the PC in the same way again.  Literally.

Every time I use it I get line behind me.A few things that could be improved:The display should have better resolution(I expected low resolution), it is sometimes hard to read text due to low resolution.I am nearsighted and I expected that I won't need glasses, but you need glasses. Also make sure they fit inside the Oculus before buying.After using extended periods of time I'm getting uncomfortably hot wearing the Oculus.

Mine eyes hath been opened and yes, VR is as incredible as 'they' say. It really is very weird to be moving around in games with monster sneaking up on you to give you a fright! The caveat though - if you're used to playing at 1080p-4K, then don't expect the resolution on this to come near that. It's by no means a deal breaker, as you get so immersed that there's no issue with it long-term. However, if you try and do a bit of pixel-peeping rather than enjoying the experience, you'll end up losing the magic. I run this with a 1080 & i5-4690K @ 4GHz and don't experience any problems, although I'm due a processor upgrade, so it'll be interesting to see how that goes. The Oculus platform is solid and you can also use Steam VR with this. Very enjoyable indeed, and I can't wait to see what the future brings in terms of increasing image quality.

Original 1 star review below.I've managed to get it working after 2 days of being in contact with tech support, countless re-installations of oculus and all my drivers. Simply put, the experience of having hands brings the immersion to a whole new level. 100% recommended if you are willing to spend the time trouble shooting, I'm considering getting another sensor now. Still loses 1 star for the lack of HDMI pass through and troubled set up, oculus support however helped me tons.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________Quite simply it doesn't work. I'm been going through all the set up for the past few hours and when I'm supposed to set up my play area there's a calibration test where it says to hold the touch controllers at eye level and walk forwards. However, at this point my sensors cannot see the controllers at all.The sensors seem fine since I can get them to work tracking the headset however the lack of troubleshooting available will not allow me to see if the issue is with the sensors or the controllers. The controllers pair fine, the sensors are using USB 3 and show no issues but it still simply doesn't work.Another annoyance is that the headset technically requires 2 HDMI ports (or 1 HDMI port and 1 other display port), my GPU only has 1 HDMI and 3x Display ports. I was expecting the first would allow me to either set up  while using the headset as a monitor or have a HDMI pass through or something. I had to buy an additional adaptor to use this and it didn't even work. I will try to get it working and if I have no luck I will be returning the product, if it does work I will update the review accordingly.

I initially cancelled my order when buying this as i thought £400 was a bit much. Any how after receiving the funds back into my account i took the plunge and reordered it anyway.I have to say it was the best decision i ever made this thing is amazing. The tutorial you play when you first plug it in blew me away as it did my Wife, mother, sister etc etc. If you are on the fence like many other reviewers state on here just BUY IT.The pro's totally outweigh the cons.

I have tried some VR via my phone before, but it always seemed a bit tinny and minimally interactive. With the price drop on the bundle, and meeting the specs on my gaming PC, I decided to give it a whirl.Took about 30 mins to set up once the installation package was downloaded (plugging in cables positioning the sensors & setting up your playzone). Then I popped on the visor.The intro is very clever with a 5 min familiarisation routine in a very plain environment showing you how the controllers work and introducing your virtual hands. What follows is simply another world that has you catching butterflies, shooting dartguns, launching rockets. Within a day or two, I was driving across alien worlds, catching bullets in midair and standing on top of mount Everest. Best thing I've bought in years

The oculus rift has taken Virtual Reality to a whole new level with the addition of the touch controllers. Front facing tracking gives you about 300* of rotation, but to get that 360* of rotation you will need the third sensor, which is a must have for all of those thinking of purchasing this product. Though most games allow you to turn around in the virtual world without you having to turn in the real world, having 360 tracking makes those features unneeded. The oculus Rift is a must have for anyone interested in VR or wanting that extra immersion when you are playing games on pc or Xbox one.

This VR is great. Yes there were setup issues ( two drivers) but help was on hand on the web. A short command prompt sorted the problem. I upgraded the graphics to give me the power(GTX1070) they work fine on HDMI and USB2. USB3 is an issue with win7 and my Gygabyte card but that not the OR s fault. Using the Rift to drive in Asetto Corsa and Project Cars is what it was bought Fi. FANTASTIC. 100% pleased with that. Slight difference in starting each game , but using the Rift is easy with my G25, old but the best wheel ever. It’s when you start using the VR space game like Recal Robot and other Free VR games that are provided as well as those  on Steam that the Rift comes into its own. Compared to the Sony and PS4 VR the RIFT is the clear winner. The card and Rift outlay is expensive but it’s a proper boys toy. Lol. Enjoy.

Hey all,I am VFX artist and Gamer so spend a lot of time in virtual worlds through the screen.I have tested pioneers of VR way back in 1996 and even back, there I knew that it will be the way to play games.When Oculus was released, I did not bother with it because of the 3 main issues: Price, Modular sale system and Lack of content. VR experience cannot be achieved without touch so why would you sell all bits separately!?Now all those 3 issues have been addressed, to acceptable degree, with this bundle. So i jumped right in. Amazing price, 6 games included (with 2 of those “must have”), and All VR experience in one box how it should be.I’m not a writer but I will try to put my feeling in to words. It is amazing! Unbelievable experience. This is the way to play shooting games and in the future, I hope for some bow, and sword fighting games. When I first tried Mouse and keyboard after console controllers, I came to conclusion that controllers are obsolete. Now after tried VR touch, I not going to play a single game with mouse and keyboard. It feels every move, every slight shake in your arms. Finally, games will require physical practice.It is not just gaming, it is full experience.P.S. We will definitely require 4K resolution down the line. On virtual desktop cannot read anything because of the resolution.

Amazing piece of hardware, I was blown away by the sheer sense of being somewhere else and that was just the introduction demo of the little robot helper showing what VR was capable of.  When the Oculus interface loaded up I felt like I had been transported to a luxury apartment.  I am eager to try more of the software on offer and at the same time a little disappointed that Fallout 4 is not available on the Rift, I am hoping titles like Elder Scrolls Online will become available as this system is well worth the expense and is more than capable of handling the environments shown in that game.

Wow.Just tried them last night, the experience is amazing. Didn't have time to do more than drop in and out of the various games available, because I had built up a bit of a library to try out while waiting on them to come back into stock. High point last night was in Echo arena where ~I threw the disc over my shoulder. I was facing a wall floating in mid air and it didn't occur to me to turn my body around because in the virtual space I was floating in zero grav rather than standing on the floor. Team mate drifting nearby in front of the goal said ""hey I was wide open why would you do that?"" - in a friendly way, mind. The striking thing was the body language - he put his hands to the sides of his head and threw them out in a ""what were you thinking"" gesture. Made me laugh out loud - the sense of ""presence"" in the arena was just amazing. Can't wait to get back!

Very happy with my purchase!A lot of people mentioned that VR was a purchase that was great fun initially and boring within a few weeks. So I made sure this was something I really wanted before I committed, though I've had it less than a week I have no regrets and have loved every second (ill update the review in time if this is the case). It is a truly immersive experience that can't be explained, it's something that can only be experienced. I look forward to diving further into its features and additional uses. There looks to be a lot of development and upcoming content for it which is exciting too!There are a handful of free games on Steam and Oculus that will get you started and keep you entertained both on your own or socially (which is a truly bizarre experience). Though I bought it so i could experiment with my 3D design work and motion graphics.Finally a few notes that may be worth sharing: (relevant to some games and applications, not all)- You can tailor the way you move in VR. If normal motion makes you queezy then there is likely a teleportation option.- apps are rated by comfort: comfortable, medium, intense.- there is a microphone in the VR headset- the headphones are surprisingly good- it's very simple to mirror the audio to both come through the rift headphones and your computer speaker (great for when friends are round)Peace, and happy VR'ing

Was on the fence for a long time - when it was £600, so couldn’t resist with summer sale.The touch controllers are what it’s all about. The immersive entertainment achieved with the touch controllers is unparalleled. Had a couple of my doubtful friends hooked on it and change their once headset driven opinions.Would it replace my consoles? Probably not as it is tiring to play it and the headset can get a bit hot causing you to sweat. But it’s an experience I will never get from console gaming. Glad I jumped in and love playing it, especially with friends. That feeling of amazement is always present after each use.Keep in mind the requirements of the headset + touch controllers (GTX 960 as a minimum, enough USB 3.0 ports) and also the cost of games (although most of them were on sale recently). Also works with Steam VR so might find some games cheaper on there. So far Robo Recall, Echo Arena and Lucky’s Tale have been my favorites.This is truly an item to be used before having an opinion on it.

Fantastic piece of kit and unreal (literally) experiences to be had. I wasn't convinced VR was that viable, but now I am on board 100%. After experiencing it, I find myself thinking about experiences that I would love to have in VR, and looking forward to the next time I get to jump into the virtual world. It's a very polished experience at the moment, and it is only going to get better. The touch controllers complete the experience. Tracking is excellent. The sense of presence is also strong.If you have a PC that can handle it, I'd definitely recommend getting one of these. I can't wait to blow the minds of my friends and family with this device!

Easy set up even in a very small room. I had to skip the boundary setup but i am just playing games where you sit. Elite etc. I was worried that the sensors wouldn't pick up but there smaller and better then i thought and fir on my desk perfect. For the most part ive just been looking at the main menu on oculus and messing around with steam VR and playing the little games like Aircar etc. The menu themes in steam VR are excellent and free downloads too.For a couple of month i was on the edge of getting one or not and when looking at videos it doesnt look good as your only seeing 2d. But as people say who are trying to show you its nothing like what you see on TV screen its full 360 degree and looks like your there.Only problem i had was it looked abit choppy at first. I have a KFA2 EX OC 1080 GTX I7 6700k 4.0ghz oced 4.5ghz 16GB 2400hz DDR4 ram. It turned out to be the refresh rate was at 144hz on my monitotr when i changed to 85hz and no FPS limit everything was smooth and as should.My right touch controller trigger button seems slacker then be for and some times the vibrate will get stuck and stay on. Any one else have this problem?.

Already had a PSVR but was really impressed by the Rift, it feels like a premium £800 product, so at the current price (£349) it's hard to regret picking it up.The touch controllers are the best on the market, and the headset is well built. But what impressed me the most was the package as a whole. Silly things like the box being really well put together and reusable, it's super convenient just clicking all the parts back in when I want to tidy it away, compared to the PSVR box which was just full of your usual cardboard inserts.The built-in headphones that I presumed would be pish, turned out to be rather decent. And the Oculus interface/ecosystem is surprisingly fleshed out and offers far more than just a store-front, being able to create your own avatar and personal space is cool.Oculus also gifted me 3 or 4 pretty decent games once I registered it, so I've been pretty amazed by the value I've got out of it.Heck, even if it didn't have any of the above I'd probably give it five stars just because Google Earth VR is incredible.

Ahora que el Rift por fin esta en el ""ballpark of 350 dollars"" con los controles touch incluidos como Palmer dijo erase una vez por fin vale la pena invertir en la Realidad Virtual.Pros:- Controles Touch son increibles. Casi inmediatamente se te olvida que estas usando controles y el uso es muy natural comparado con los controles del Vive.- El headset es muy ligero y comodo, la fabricacion es solida y de alta calidad, es muy facil de ajustar y una vez ajustado no necesitas volver a reajustarlo a menos que que otras personas le muevan.- El headset incluye audio de sorprendentemente buena calidad y microfono.- El software funciona muy bien y es facil de usar- Tracking es muy bueno una vez que tienes todo ya instalado, especialmente si utilizas sensores adicionales para VR en cuarto (room scale)- Utilizar el rift es un placer una vez que estas en VR ya que se te olvida que lo traes puestoCons:- Tracking no es tan versatil como en el Vive, sobre todo para empezar ya que es solo util para jugar en 360 grados sin moverte de tu lugar con lo que incluye este paquete.- Si quieres un area de juego mas amplia necesitas sensores adicionales (1 sensor extra, 3 en total para un area de juego de 3x3m y 2 sensores extra, 4 en total para un area de 4x4m) Estos sensores y todos los cables requeridos para conectarlos tienen un costo extra.- Los requerimientos USB 3.0 de estos sensores extra tambien pueden causar problemas de conexion dependiendo de tu sistema, y puede requerir una tarjeta USB 3.0 adicional para solucionar, lo cual es otro costo extra (Checar la tarjeta USB 3.0 StarTech PEXUSB3S44V y ver mi reseña para mas informacion al respecto.)- La instalacion de todo cablerio para conectar los sensores puede ser un problema, aunque una vez instalado se te olvida porque estas muy ocupado jugando en VROtros:- Facebook compro a Oculus, y dependiendo de tu opinion acerca de la compañia esto puede ser un mas o un menos para ti.- Siendo primera generacion de VR tiene limitaciones en cuanto a resolucion y area de vision limitada (field of view) que se resolveran en siguientes versiones. Tambien habra mejoras en los controles usados en VR.- Estas siguientes versiones al momento de escribir esto (enero 2018) todavia estan por lo menos un par de años de distancia, asi que depende de si te quieres esperar o no. Quiza en el CES 2018 tengamos noticias de que podemos esperar en el futuro inmediato, pero el Pimax 8K es una buena indicacion de que es lo que podemos esperar en la siguiente generacion. Una vez que las tarjetas graficas tengan el suficiente poder computacional para manejar esas resoluciones sin sacrificar otras cosas.Para concluir el precio de VR nunca ha sido mas accesible y va a seguir bajando, y aunque sin duda todavia es una inversion en este momento tampoco hay duda alguna de que vale la pena por la experiencia. Una vez que experimentes juegos de accion como Super Hot VR o Robo Recall, o te pasees por el mundo con Google Earth, nunca veras la realidad virtual y el futuro de estas tecnologias de la misma forma.

A must buy.......If you can afford it of course.These VR devices offers something not experienced before in gaming as far as I know. Forget that expensive monitor purchase and get into VR.The build quality of the Oculus Rift is fantastic. Set up is fairly straightforward, just make you have enough clear floor space.Words cannot describe what you will experience when putting on this device, you have to see for yourself.There are loads of free content which is great considering the asking price which is worth it for sure.Make sure to watch videos on how to wear it correctly and set up your IPD which is the distance between your pupils. Also take plenty of breaks and take your time to get used to the possible motion sickness that may occur with some games.You will need a capable PC with at least a GTX 1060 minimum imo to reach that 90 frames per second target which will help to avoid simulation sickness.You can also watch movies in the cinema and various environments.Once you show your friends and family you will have a hard time getting a turn as it has that wow factor so keep it to yourself for the first few days.

Solid bit of kit. Been flawless so far. Yes, the eye pieces can fog up occasionally. No, it doesn't come with any sort of stands or storage for the controllers. The headset could do with an extension lead of sorts. I'd like to be able to unplug the headset and put it away in a proper storage box when not in use. But at the moment it means having to pull the PC unit out from under a tight desk to get to the connectors. An extension pack would mean I could unplug it without pulling out the PC. One thing to consider, but I am being picky.

Wow.I honestly thought this would be a gimick, but it just blew my mind. I had no idea vr has come so far.Its been so hassle free to setup, which is something I did not expect.I had 0 troubles playing for hours, no disiness or nose hurting (unlike other devices) thanks to the awesome head strap.For me, the best part is unlike playing normal games. I felt satisfied playing these games, I didnt feel like I was wasting my time.And because I play most games standing up, I felt like I never played it for the sakes of killing time. I would legit be playing it for enjoyment of the experience.Unlike when I play your Dota, cs go, or overwatch. Where I play endlessly without thinking or enjoyment just out of habbit.

Definitely worth the £349. I was a bit sceptical at first, but when you finally get going with it you'll have a big grin on your face. There's not many products that invoke that kind of reaction. I actually flinch when playing robo recall and a robot jumps in your face. It's not necessarily realistic, but it is truly immersive. You lose any sense of direction or position in the room after a while.

Coming from the DK2, I have to say this is a vast improvement, the screens alone are in a different league to that, it's also much more comfortable.I've tried the HTC Vive and while its room scale VR is impressive, its not always practical (I'd imagine very few people have basically an entire room to devote to a VR setup), plus the controllers on the Vive are just terrible compared to the Rifts.I've been able to use this for many hours (things like Elite Dangerous and EuroTruck simulator 2 just eat time) and its been perfectly fine to wear without issue (DK2 caused a fair amount of face sweat and steam to build up).I can't say I'm a huge fan of the Oculus store, though we can run most Steam VR games anyway, so its just an extra place to get games that may be on sale.Keep in mind the kind of system required to run this thing, but if you already own one, I'd say this is quite a bargain for the price.Also if you want the whole room scale thing, you can just get an extra sensor (this kit comes with 2) and then wire up all 3 around the room.Side note, I am very glad Oculus put a sensor in this thing to work out when you're actually wearing it, the DK2 lacked this and image burn in over the OLED screens was sadly very much real.Overall I am very happy with this thing, it really is the next level of gaming, is VR the next big thing, I don't think so just yet, give it a few years, but for those of us who really want to play around with this stuff, I'd say now is a very good time to consider it.

pro:+ Verarbeitung der Hardware ist spitze+ Tracking der Hände unterstützt Immersion+ ""Akku""laufzeit der Touch-Controller. Musste die Batterien nie auswechseln+ Kein Spielerlebnis ist intensiver, als einem Pfeil mit Kopfbewegungen auszuweichen und selbst einen abzuschießenneutral:° Ein Kabel führt von der Rift zum PC. Das stört mich nur in den seltensten Fällen. Weit weniger als man vermuten würde.  Spiele aber auch hauptsächlich im Stand!con:- - FOV ist viel kleiner als man erwartet, eher wie eines der Smartphone ""HMDs"" als wie im echten Leben.  Das nimmt stark die Immersion, wenn man sich nicht bewegt. Während man spielt, bemerkt man es hin und wieder. Größter Minuspunkt!- Software ist ein Krampf. Installation (Problem mit Win-Updates), obligatorisches Drittanbieter-Tool (Oculus Tray Tool) und Kalibrierung- Pixeldichte zu klein. Eher verkraftbar als die geringe FOV. Während man wenn man spielt bemerkt man es eigentlich kaum.- Preis. Die Spiele sind ziemlich teuer und viele sind einfach nicht gut. Gibt aber ein paar Perlen wie z. B. I expect you to die.- Kein Power-Schalter. Jedes mal muss das Kabel rausgezogen werden.- Die Rift ist schwer und wird sehr warm. Gerade nach längeren Sitzungen, gerade im Sommer, wird das ziemlich brutal- God Rays. Wirklich nicht lustig. Dachte meine Linsen sind verschmiert, aber sind nur die verbauten Linsen. Wirklich immersionsraubend. Bei  sehr vielen Spielen bei den Splash Screens zu sehen!Fazit:Gerade was die Software und den fehlenden Power-Schalter angeht fragt man sich, was sich Oculus dabei gedacht hat.Ich würde es wirklich nur für Leute empfehlen, die wie ich Jahre darauf gewartet haben oder wirklich viel Geld übrig haben (vor allem, weil sich die kostenlosen ""Spiele"" wirklich keiner antun sollte).Filme darauf zu sehen, könnt ihr gleich vergessen. Die Immersion lässt sofort nach, wenn man sich nicht mehr bewegt.Ich freue mich sehr auf die nächste Generation.Eyetracking, leichteres Gerät, höhere Auflösung, Linsen austauschen - Evolution wird es richten.Die FOV ist momentan mein größtes Manko, aber auch dafür soll es eine Lösung geben, soweit ich mal aufgeschnappt habe:Einfache LEDs um das echte Bild herum. Eine Art Ambient-Light. Einfache Lösung für viel mehr Immersion.Drücken wir die Daumen!

Wer vorher noch nie VR ausprobiert hat, ist am Anfang, wenn man das Headset für das Tutorial das erste mal aufsetzt, komplett geflashed. Die Hände sind da wo man sie vermutet, greifen, boxen, werfen fühlen sich sehr ""echt"" an. Dann zockt man die ersten Games an und ist auch da sofort drin. Ich habe für den Anfang Robo Recall angespielt, ziemlich schweißtreibend. Dann noch Echo Arena, dafür braucht man schon einen festen Stand, das schweben durch den Raum ist schon ziemlich abgespaced. Abgespaced ist auch das schweben durch die ISS, muss man auch mal gemacht haben. Google Earth VR ist auch atemberaubend!Wofür ich mir das Headset eigentlich gekauft habe, ist aber Assetto Corsa in Verbindung mit einem G27 Lenkrad und Rennsitz. Und das funktioniert prima! Die Strecke und die Landschaft sind durch den riesen Blickwinkel zwar unscharf, man erkennt die Strecke in ein paar Hundert meter vor einem nur als pixelbrei, aber das ist völlig egal. Erstens kannte ich die Strecken schon und zweitens gibt es durch VR mehr Vorteile als Nachteile. Man hat einfach viel eher das Gefühl in einem Auto zu sitzen. Und so fährt man auch. Man trifft seine Ideallinie, man kann auf den cm genau am Curb vorbei fahren, Gegenlenken wenn das Heck kommt merkt man in millisekunden und kann sofort regieren, bei Überholmanövern hat man ein super Gefühl für Abstand, Verzögerung des Vordermannes usw.. Das alles hat man auf einem Flatscreen einfach nicht so.Ich bin leider mit meinem System (Dell T20 e3 1225, rx470 4gb, 12gb ram) eher am unteren Ende des VR Hardware Bereichs. Aber Assetto Corsa läuft super flüssig. Meistens sind es 90 Frames, bei manchen Multiplayer Sessions sind es 45 Frames, was mir wohl dank Spacewarp nicht auffällt. Ich habe aber früher auch Spiele mit 20 fps gezockt, bin also nicht so empfindlich. Pixel per Display habe ich auf 1.8, AA voll aufgedreht, dass soll gegen die Unschärfe helfen, wie auch immer?! Post Process Effekte habe ich auf minimal. Damit läuft es also ganz gut. Ansonsten laufen bis jetzt alle Spiele mit der rx470 flüssig.Noch ein Wort zu dem Roomscale. Roomscale und 360° funktioniert bei mir mit einer Einschränkung. Drehen um 360° geht, weil das Headset ja auch hinten IR LEDs drin hat. Nur darf man mit seinen Händen nicht in den ""Kamera Schatten"" kommen, wenn man sich zb 180° gedreht hat. Deswegen ploppt bei Robo Recall zB ""zu den Sensoren drehen"" auf. Wenn man sich beamt, wird man 180° teleportiert, sodass man sich zum Gegner umdrehen muss. Dann passt es wieder. Bei Arizona Sunshine muss man sich selber in die richtige Position beamen, finde ich etwas komplizierter. Abhilfe schafft da nur ein dritter Sensor, der ist aber nicht wirklich notwendig. Mein Raum ist übrigens 2,60m hoch, trotzdem schafft es mein Bruder das Kabelmanagement system unter der Decke abzureißen.. Aber besser, als die ganze Zeit auf seinem Kabel zu stehen. Linsenschutz würde ich außerdem noch empfehlen. ich habe mir Linsenaufkleber der Vive bestellt und etwas kleiner ausgeschnitten und aufgeklebt. Gibt es irgendwo schon Aufkleber für die Rift Linsen?Achja: Mein Bild hatte eine leichte Schieflage. Es ist so, als ob der Horizont links etwas runter hängt. Nach 20 email mit dem Oculus Support gebe ich nun mein Headset zurück, bzw lasse es gegen ein neues tauschen. Der Fehler scheint äußerst selten zu sein, sodass oculus selber auch nicht helfen konnte. Ich werde berichten, ob es mit dem neuen Headset auch ist... dann wäre es wohl mein PCUpdate:Die neue Brille hatte keine Schieflage mehr, dafür eine vertikale schwarze Linie / Pixelfehler. Meine dritte Rift ist nun komplett Mägelfrei.Ich habe außerdem noch VR Cover bestellt, man schwitzt weniger, die Linsen beschlagen nicht mehr.

Ein Head-Mounted Display stand schon länger auf meiner Wunschliste und aufgrund der vielleicht besten Controller sollte es vorzugsweise die Oculus Rift werden. Zum Angebotspreis des Sets mit Brille, Sensoren und Controllern sowie Spielebundle habe ich nun endlich zugeschlagen.Gute Controller gehören zum VR-Erlebnis auf jeden Fall dazu, ich würde nicht in eine Lösung ohne investieren, weil erst mit Controllern die coolsten Games spielbar sind, die ein echtes ""Mittendrin-Gefühl"" vermitteln. Dazu gehört auf jeden Fall der beiliegende Vorzeigetitel Robo Recall. Auch das Taktik-Sportspiel Sparc konnte mich stark begeistern, welches getrennt erworben werden kann.Ich bin wirklich verblüfft, wie gut das Tracking funktioniert und wie flüssig alles läuft (einen starken PC vorausgesetzt). Das Tischtennisspiel Racket Fury zeigt auch, wie gut die Technik funktioniert. Es ist eine wahre Freude virtuelles Tischtennis zu spielen und keiner muss zum Ball Einsammeln laufen ;-)Wer eine Fläche von mindestens 2x2m zur Verfügung hat, kann die meisten Spiele sehr gut spielen. Die Kabellänge der Sensoren beträgt etwa 2 Meter und die des HMD etwa 4 Meter. Wenn das nicht reicht, muss man Verlängerungskabel benutzen. Für USB 3.0 für die Sensoren und HDMI + USB 3.0 für das HMD. Ein dritter Sensor für die Rückseite ist optional, für den Anfang würde ich jedem empfehlen, erstmal mit den 2 beiliegenden Sensoren zu testen.Um auszuprobieren, wie mein Körper auf VR reagiert, hatte ich mir mal eine Brille für die Nutzung mit Handy geordert. Ich konnte feststellen, dass bestimmte Bewegungen Schwindel und Unwohlsein hervorrufen. Das tritt immer dann auf, wenn die Bewegungen in der Realität nicht mit dem Bild in der VR-Brille zusammenpassen. Deshalb benutzen auch viele Spiele zur Fortbewegung des Charakters im Spiel einen Teleport anstatt der Kamerabewegung vorwärts auf Knopfdruck (ein Schritt nach vorn oder zur Seite innerhalb des Spielfeldes wird im Spiel genauso umgesetzt und verursacht keinen Schwindel). Problematisch wird es bei Bewegungen im Spiel wenn man in Wahrheit stillsteht oder sitzt. So ist es mir zum Beispiel nicht möglich, mit der Brille richtig gute Autorennspiele wie Dirt Rally zu spielen. Mein Auge sieht die starke Bewegung nach vorn aber mein Gleichgewichtssinn sagt meinem Gehirn ich sitze still. Das führt bei mir sofort zu Schwindel und Übelkeit. Das muss ich dann weiterhin am TV spielen.Mit allen anderen Spielen hatte ich aus den genannten Gründen keine Probleme und bin sehr glücklich mit meinem Kauf. Wer bisher noch nicht mit VR in Berührung gekommen ist, dem kann ich nur raten, es mal zu testen. In Wirklichkeit ist das Gefühl viel krasser als es irgendwelche Videos oder Bilder vermitteln können.

Decent price at £349 and setup was a breeze with the video tutorial from web site, which took about 30mins to get right.After setup and first experience with the rift and making sure everything is working, you are greeted with the oculus client which also has its own shops and games for the rift (plenty of free games and other software)  but with me all the best deals was with steams own vr client which works well as long as you restart steam after installing the update (very important as i had to look this up because it wasn't working)Soon (after some installing and updating) your in your own vr world and sometimes punching your chairs you forgot to move or walking into your pc desk to avoid bullets etc and knowing that f12 (re-center the vr view, and in some games R key) becomes very important as your over to the other side of the room to where you started!But its watching others on the headset which made this a hit over xmas, nephews would not go home as i had trouble getting them off Robo Recall.But also a word of warning, some games are a bit too much on the stomach like No limits 2 which simulates a roller coaster (very realistic) and ultrawings is another.But please make sure you have a pc of running this, the oculus rifts own website has a program you can download to see if your pc is upto spec and so does steam.If you have? then welcome to a different level of gaming.

Lange habe ich über die Anschaffung der Rift nachgedacht....und letzendlich habe ich mich dann dafür entschieden. Generell eine schöne Anschaffung, wenn man mal ""etwas besonderes will"".Die Bildqualität ist in Ordnung.Das Tracking funktioniert perfekt, die Bewegungen sind identisch mit den realen Bewegungen.Man hat tatsächlich das Gefühl, dass man sich in der Virtuellen Welt befindet.Ich habe die Oculus Rift jedoch nach 3 Tagen zurückgeschickt.Folgender Grund:Laut Beschreibung ist ein Linsenabstand bis 72mm möglich. Schauen wir jedoch durch die Brille, so fällt bei der Einstellung auf, dass tatsächlich nur ein maximaler Pupillenabstand von 70mm technisch möglich ist.Wenn man aufgrund seines überdimensionalen Körperbaus außerhalb der Norm liegt und über 70mm Pupillenabstand (selbst 71mm) hat, so schmerzen nach sehr kurzer Zeit die Augen, da das Bild unscharf ist und die Sehachse der Augen unnatürlich ""verbogen"" wird.Daher gebe ich auch nur 3 Sterne für die technische Seite, da die VR Brille an sich Spaß macht.

Ich hatte in der Universität die Chance die Oculus innerhalb eines Kurses auszuprobieren und da war mir klar - ich muss eine haben! Also schnell den PC ein wenig aufgewertet und bestellt. Es fasziniert mich jeden Tag wieder, wie sehr man in Spielwelten eintauchen kann. Beeindruckend fand ich auch Google Earth!Der Tragekomfort ist gegeben und sie passt der ganzen Familie, die sie natürlich auch gleich ausprobieren musste ;)Aufbau ist einfach und man wird sehr gut durchgeführt, was mir am Anfang schwer fiel, war der Aufbau der Sensoren, da ich diese immer auf mich einstellen wollte - Richtig ist es aber sie gerade in den Raum schauen zu lassen, nicht auf den Spieler selbst.

This totally blew me away, the hardware is slick and the new home software is slick as-well.  Easy to setup and easy to use, the only niggle would be that on occasion the lenses can steam up and the cables for the sensors are too short if you want to put one behind you.

Kurz vorweg, ich bin sehr begeistert vom Rift :) Ich hoffe, dass die Begeisterung auch länger anhält. Hab die Brille erst 3 Tage :)VR sollte jeder Gamer wenigstens mal ausprobiert haben. Eine komplett neue Erfahrung!Als sich jemand im Freundeskreis VR für die PS4 geholt hat, wusste ich nicht recht, was man davon halten soll. Fand die 3D Erfahrung am TV schon toll, aber so richtig warm ist man damit ja nicht geworden.Hab mir dann aus Jux mal  ein Rift für meinen PC bestellt. Hab das Teil dann ausprobiert und die ersten Demos hauen einen da echt schon um. Man ist wirklich mittendrin im Geschehen. Die Bedienung mit den Touch Controllern ist wirklich ausgezeichnet. Wenn man das Teil dann benutzt, vergeht die Zeit leider wie im Flug.Anzumerken ist noch, dass die Oculus Rift auch ein vollständiges Headset ist. Das die Rift Kopfhörer hat ist ja unschwer zu erkennen. Mir war aber nicht bekannt, dass auch ein Micro verbaut ist. Das Micro ist zudem sogar brauchbar und mir wurde im Teamspeak und Discord gesagt, dass ich mit dem Micro top zu verstehen bin.Der Klang der Kopfhörer ist super. Benutze sonst ein Beyerdynamic DT990 Edition am PC. Ich habe einiges an Headsets durch und war immer vom Klang und/oder von den verbauten Micros enttäuscht. Ich  muß sagen, dass ich die DT990 beim Rift nicht vermisse. Das hat Oculus echt super hinbekommenDas was mir bisher am besten gefallen hat, möchte ich Euch noch mit auf dem Wege geben. Soll wohl auch viel Müllcontent geben.  Da die Brille für mich auch neu ist, würde ich mich über den einen oder anderen Software-Geheimtip freuen.Hier ein paar kostenlose Erlebnisse, also Geschichten die man einfach nur auf sich wirken lassen kann:Invasion! - Eine kleine Geschichte aus der HasenperspektiveHenry - Die Geschichte eines Igels. Wirklich beeindruckend gemachtDear Angelica - Hier wird eine gemalte Geschichte gezeigt. Am besten die ""Steh-Version""Dreamdeck - paar TechdemosLost - ....einmal ganz klein fühlen :)An Games hab ich bisher nur 3 Spiele, Arizona Sunshine, Superhot VR und Project Cars, gespielt. Die ersten beiden schauen auf Youtube nicht sonderlich spannend aus, machen aber beide richtig Spaß. Project Cars VR ist ansich toll gemacht. Die Fahrzeuge und der Innenraum wirken sehr plastisch. Ich hatte nach dem Ritt auf der Nordschleife allerdings etwas mit einen flauen Gefühl zu tun (Motion Sickness).An Programmen (Werkzeugen) hab ich mir dann noch den DeoVR Video Player und Virtual Desktop installiert. Der Videoplayer ist wirklich klasse. Videos sollte man mit dem Oculus Rift unbedingt mal probieren. 3D Inhalte werden meiner Meinung nach besser dargestellt, als aufm einem 3D TV (habe da einen 55"" LG mit 3D)Virtual Desktop ist von der Sache her  auch ein schönes Programm, nur sollte man bedenken, dass Schriften mit der Brille nicht so toll zu lesen sind. Hier muß ich den Virtuellen Monitor doch recht nach an mich anziehen. Denke hier muß man hoffen, dass Brillen der zweiten Generation das zukünftig besser machen.Und dann noch kurz was für Brillenträger. Ja man kann eine Brille tragen. Aber es sollte dann ein eher zartes Gestell sein und keine ""Nerd-Brille"". Ich benutze dafür meine feine Silhouette MinimalArt. Die hat sehr feine Bügel und stören so gut wie gar nicht. Würde jedem Brillenträger ans Herz legen, es erstmal ohne Sehhilfe zu probieren. Man sieht mehr, als man vielleicht denken mag. Bei mit fehlt es mit ca -2 Dpt. dann aber an Schärfe. Es gibt wohl aber von einen Hersteller, der ""Brillengläser"" für VR Brillen macht. Falls damit schon jemand Erfahrungen gemacht hat, dann würde ich mich über einen Kommentar freuen.

El producto es ideal para VR pero el PC tiene que estar preparado, recomiendo analizar primero el pc a través del archivo que tiene el fabricante en su web que analiza todos los sistemas para que funcione correctamente.

Since buying a rift, I have come to realise that I'm not as brave as I thought I was. The feeling of actually being somewhere else is amazing, you will duck to avoid things, you will feel nervous wondering whats behind you. The sound in the built in headphones, while they don't block out sound around you, will still give you a great 360 degress sence. Hearing something behind you and turning around to see that it's actually there is when it hits you. If you can afford it and your pc can handle it, get one.

Ich hatte meine liebe Not bei der Installation von Rift. Alle, die eine Radeon GPU mit Multimonitor verwenden seien gewarnt: das macht eine Menge Ärger.Nachdem diese Hürde (mehr oder weniger) genommen war, kam bei mir jedoch das Staunen. Der 3D Effekt zusammen mit dem präzisen Head-Tracking gibt ein unbeschreibliches Gefühl. Das muss man  einem Spiel wie Robo Recall (das gratis beigelegt ist) wirklich mal erleben.Normalerweise würde ich ein oder zwei Sterne abziehen wegen der Probleme mit Multimonitor/Radeon aber das Enderbegnis ist einfach zu gut.Als Brillenträger hat man allerdings nicht das bequemste Spielerlebnis. Ich hab mir deshalb jetzt Brillengläser passend für die Rift bestellt.Was mich aber dazu bewogen hat einen Stern abzuziehen ist zum einen der Fliegengittereffekt und zum anderen der recht starke Lens Flare bei hellen Szenen (warum da eine Fresnel Linse verbaut wurde, weiss ich nicht...)

What can I say, outstanding! like some reviews have mentioned there is nothing that can portray how good this is , not youtube or any other video other than buying it and trying it for yourself. Works fine with steam as long as you enable the option in the Oculus program settings to do so.If you are hesitant about buying the Oculus or the Vive, I personally think the touch controllers for the Oculus is a major selling point as theyare extremely comfortable to use and are truly remarkable to the point of perfection.You won't be disappointed 5 Stars.

I love the Oculus Rift but while it has many free games and paid games to enjoy they all lack what modern consoles have and that is a purpose in games.Most games are cool but are usually just you exploring, looking around and experiencing apart from a very select few such as Lone Echo, Skyrim VR, Fallout VR,  LA Noire VR and Superhot VR. All of these except one have something in common and that is they are previously console games.If you play with a friend it is definitely more enjoyable.

I bought this for my work- I'm a digital sculptor. Never in my most optimistic dreams would I have guessed at the true game changing nature of VR. But now I know! You have to try it for yourself: no-one can be told what it's like you have to experience it for yourself, and an experience it truly is. The sense of presence, you are 'there', the feeling of being in another place is truly almost overwhelming. Buy one if you have a computer strong enough, you won't regret it.

Watching films, using google earth and other apps are a whole new experience, the only issue I had was having to buy extension leads for the HDMI and USB (just gives it more move ability)For the sale price its a bargain, the only downside is you will completely lose track of time while on it!!!Go for it!

Fantastic... been gaming for many years and this really is one of the best things I have ever used. Yes, there are well documented short comings but you really don't notice them once you get into a good game. Not suffered from VR sickness in anything yet although I do prefer slower games with this. The touch controllers are great. Can be a bit fiddly in some games but I think that is an issue with the game rather than the controller. I still play with the monitor but spend lots of time thinking ""I wish I could just turn my head to look over there""Setup is simple. Took about 1/2 hour. I have to move my PC into the lounge to play but it takes a few minutes to unplug, move, and plug everything back in. I did install the Oculus software beforehand though and made sure all the drivers were up to date.I waited a while for the price to come down. Hopefully the next iteration will be wireless with higher resolution. I'd probably jump in earlier next time.

Ich bin etwas gespalten, einerseits WOW! Andererseits nicht ausgereift aber doch schon recht brauchbar. Die Techdemos die man bekommt sind zum Teil umwerfend und man hat schon ein ungutes Gefühl wenn einem der T-Rex im Museum anbrüllt oder man vor einen Abgrund steht und sich irgendwie nicht vorgehen traut obwohl man weiß das der Boden weiter geht. 3 Sterne und etwas mehr. Ich hab 4 gewählt da 3,5 nicht geht.Was gefällt mir nicht oder was muss dringend in der nächsten Version verbessert werden? Ach ja noch ein Hinweis, es wird immer von Brillenträger geredet, aber wirklich nirgends steht welcher zum Teufel. Ich dachte so nahe wie die Linsen sitzen müsste es die Lesebrille sein. Weit gefehlt, es ist die Fernbrille die ich auch zum Fernsehen nehme. Also wer unsicher ist, die Fernbrille.Hier beginnt auch die Verbesserung. Für Brillen ist zu wenig Platz, es ist ein ungutes Gefühl wenn man mit der Brille an der Oculus Linse ansteht.Die Linsen selber sind meiner Meinung nach nicht wirklich sauber verarbeitet, sie werden zum Rand hin trübe und unscharf und man sieht im richtigen Winkel die Verklebung die doch recht weit ins Sichtfeld geht, wobei zu sagen ist dass die Schärfe im allgemeinen nicht weltbewegend ist. Ich meine dabei nicht den Fliegengittereffekt. Schriften weiter weg sind schwer zu lesen wenn sie nicht groß sind. Ich habe 1.5 Dioptrien, und es wird auch mit der Brille nicht besonders viel besser. Mir fehlen hier leider Vergleichswerte zu anderen Brillen. Es wäre notwendig wenn man die Linsen besser anpassen könnte, nicht nur den Augenabstand.Bewegungen mit der Brille sind nicht besonders Easy da das Kabel eher kurz ist und man sich schnell einmal im Eifer des Gefecht einmal einwickelt. Das Optional angebotene längere Kabel könnte hier schon fix verbaut sein. Eine Kabellose Verbindung tut wirklich not, das gilt auch für einen eventuellen 3. Sensor. Leider ist die im Moment angebotene W-Lan Verbindung sein Geld nicht wert wenn man den Rezessionen glauben soll.  Der Inhalt des Paket ist ja bekannt, was aber fehlt und immer wieder gebraucht wird von manchen Spielen das ist der Oculus Remote welches man direkt bei Oculus kaufen muss. Bei Amazon habe ich es bisher nicht gefunden.Nicht nur Techdemos, auch Spiele sind wirklich beeindruckend. Es bekommt alles eine andere Dimension. Man hat plötzlich eine Ahnung wie groß etwas ist, nein man sieht und fühlt es, man ist mitten drinnen. Das bringt ein Monitor nicht hin. Was auch beeindruckt, sind wirkliche Spielfilme. Beim Disneydemo sieht man sehr gut wo es hingeht. Ich könnte mir vorstellen das man in 10-15 Jahren mit der Brille Kino schaut. Man ist mitten drinnen, wirklich WOW! Da vergisst man eine Zeitlang Unschärfe Fliegengitter...Was man leider immer wieder liest ist der nicht besondere Support von Oculus. Auch scheint die Qualitätskontrolle nicht zu funktionieren. Leider hört man immer wieder von schlecht verklebten Linsen. Ich habe auch so eine erwischt und bin erst durch eine andere Rezession drauf gekommen dass das wirklich ein Fehler ist. Oculus scheint im Moment eher mit Preis als Qualitätskontrolle zu arbeiten. Ungut wenn der Support dann immer versucht als normal und in der Toleranz zu bezeichnen. Man kann das schwer fotografieren, aber ich denke auf den Fotos ist doch zu erkennen dass hier etwas nicht stimmt. Interessanterweise scheint meistens, wie auch hier, die linke Seite betroffen zu sein.Update: 08.03Ich habe von Amazon eine Ersatzbrille bekommen, Amazon wie immer 1a, Danke.Die Brille hat bei den Linsen keine erkennbaren Fehler, ist etwas schärfer.Grundsätzlich ist die Schärfe vermutlich ein Thema. Leider fehlen mir hier die Vergleiche.Ich kann leider keine HTC zum Vergleich testen da ich keinen Bezug dazu habe und Amazon die HTC im Moment nicht im Programm hat.In Summe ist das Erlebnis um dieses Geld sehenswert. Das die Brille jetzt 24 Stunden WELTWEIT wegen eines vergessenen Zertifikat nicht funktioniert hat, schafft auch nicht gerade Vertrauen. Sollte ich eine HTC testen können ohne dass ich sie mir gleich kaufen muss, schreibe ich das Ergebnis gerne als Update hier rein.

I bought this to work with my laptop which according to Oculus' compatibility checker met the recommended system requirements for everything except the processor which met the minimum requirements.  I had a laptop running a GTX 1060 6gb, 8 GB Ram and an i5 6300q processor.  It fell down on the processor and although it did run things and didn't often run them at 90fps.  However I was sufficiently blown away to return my laptop and buy a desktop with an i58600k, 16gb Ram and a GTX 1080.It's now amazing in everyway and playing Project Cars 2 with a VR headset is epicThe touch controllers are so intuitive.  They are very responsive and feel really nice to use.

Ich habe das Rift + Touch bundle gekauft, mit der Rift, 2 Controllern und 2 Sensoren.Das Einrichten war kein Problem. Man braucht allerdings mehr Platz zum Spielen als ich dachte. 2x2 Meter sollte man schon haben, diese Fläche sollte etwa 40 cm vor den Sensoren verfügbar sein. Jetzt zu den Stärken und SchwächenStärken:Unglaubliches NEUES Spiel Erlebnis – das kann man nicht stark genug betonen.Guter SoundKostenlose Spiele Robo Recall und dead and burriedauch mit Brille spielbarMit alten Grafikkarten spielbarRessourcenschonendKann auch steam Titel spielenSchwächen:Es bleibt immer eine gewisse Unschärfe beim SpielenDie Kopfhörer rasten nur widerwillig ein und klappen zu leicht zurücksehr dünnes Spieleangebot mit wirklich guten Titeln, die meisten Titel sind sinnlose ShooterEine eigene Desktopanzeige des Windows Desktop sollte zur Basisausstattung gehören, da man oft am Desktop Anzeigen hat, die die Rift betreffen.Die Kabel der Sensoren sollten länger seinTeure Spiele im Oculus ShopFazit: Da es sich um die erste Generation handelt, akzeptiere ich die Schwächen, da das Spielgefühl  teils atemberaubend ist. Leider gibt es noch nicht ausreichend wirklich gute Spiele. Ich halte Ballerspiele für contraproduktiv um diese neue Spielerfahrung durch zu setzen. Kleine Demos wie „Lost“ gehen eher in die richtige Richtung, da sie dir Zeit lassen dich umzusehen(Worauf es bei VR wohl ankommt). Super Hot ist definitiv ein Titel, den ich für die Rift empfehlen kann, auch weil die Helligkeit des Spiels die Unschärfe verschwinden läßt.Ich kann dieses Paket nur wärmstens empfehlen.

Achtung, die Artikelbeschreibung enthält einen Fehler: der mögliche Linsenabstand beträgt nicht wie in der Artikelbeschreibung zu sehen 58-72 mm, sondern 58 - maximal 70 mm bei der Kalibration mit der Oculus-Software und nur 58-69,4 mm beim Verstellen in der aktiven Nutzung. Für den 08/15 Nutzer spielt das keine Rolle, Benutzer, die eine Pupillendistanz größer 70 mm haben, bekommen allerdings erhebliche Probleme, da Linsenmitte und Sehachse nicht mehr deckungsgleich sind. Die Folge ist ein unscharfes Bild, das, wenn überhaupt, durch Verschieben der Brille nur auf einem Auge scharf zu halten ist und dessen Qualität in der Peripherie rasch abnimmt. Trotz intensiver Bemühungen inklusive Kauf einer korrigierenden  Sehhilfe ist es mir nicht gelungen, ein akzeptables Ergebnis zu erzielen.

Vraiment bluffant. Ma dernière expérience VR datait de 2015, sur le premier casque VR d'Oculus version développeur, et c'était déjà magique.Points positifs : - Qualité audio et vidéo - Immersion - Les manettes sont vraiment très bien pensées - Facilité de configuration logiciellePoints négatifs : - Faible choix de jeux. Passé la démo qui est superbe, il n'y a pas grand chose, c'est souvent de petits jeux pas aboutis à des prix prohibitifs - Motion sickness : Je pensais que les gens exagéraient, mais non. De mon expérience, ça n'arrive que lors de mouvements fluides dans le jeu. J'ai essayé sur Skyrim VR, avec les déplacements et rotations de caméra en fluide : j'ai été malade au bout de 15mn. Vraiment malade. Avec les déplacements et rotation en ""cranté"", aucun problème, mais l'immersion est brisée et c'est difficile de se repérer dans l'espace. - Longueur des cables : Diable que c'est court. Mon PC est à la frontière de l'aire de jeu et je tends parfois le câble. Si vous voulez jouer avec une perche pour les fils (conseillé), achetez des rallonges. - Cablage : Il faut un port HDMI et 3 ports USB 3.0, dont 2 peuvent être des ports 2.0 au prix d'une réactivité plus faible. Certains ports USB 3.0 ne sont PAS compatible, j'en ai fait les frais. Oculus propose sur son site un logiciel permettant de tester si le PC est compatible avec l'Oculus et peut détecter ce genre de problème, alors vérifiez avant l'achat !Au final, je ne regrette pas cet achat, mais il faudra probablement attendre 3-4 ans de plus pour que des jeux et applications VR soient développés, et non pas des adaptations VR de jeux déjà existants et non pensés pour la VR.

WICHTIGES VORWEG: Prüft ob ihr genügend USB 3.0 Anschlüsse am PC habt, ein Hub kann kaum mehr als 2 Koponenten betreiben oder die Leistung sack DEUTLICH ein. Besser alles direkt am PC anschließen und im worst case eine USB 3.0 PCI-E Karte einbauen!Habe es mir für 400€ gegönnt und ich kann mich allen anderen >=4 Rezensionen im Grundfazit anschließen.Es ist ein absolut geniales Erlebnis, mit kleinen Abzügen aber!Ich lasse mal den Fakt mit den Belüftungslöchern durch die Licht scheint weg, das ist nichts entscheidendes aber Perfektionisten würden sich daran sicher stören. Gleiches gilt in meinen Augen auch für die Sitzposition der Brille, man muss sie immer erst ein klein wenig hoch und runter ruckeln bis alles überall scharf zu sehen ist.Mehr störend sind die kleinen aber feinen und absolut unnötigen Stolpersteine!SteamVR funktioniert nicht out of the Box, man muss erst in der Oculus Einstellung ""Quellen unbekannter Herkunft"" erlauben damit SteamVR die Brille über Oculus Home verwenden kann ... dass Oculus Home hier nicht einen ""Hintergrundmodus"" anbietet und immer wieder die Oculus Software starte und auf dem Bildschirm einblendet NERVT!Außerdem kann man ""Out of the Box"" nur reine VR Spiele spielen mit der passenden Unterstützung. Oculus Home ist zwar nett aber erinnert eher an den Playstore, wo man nur eine eingeschränkte Auswahl hat und sonst mit dem PC selber und vor allem Windows nichts anstellen kann, während man mit SteamVR zumindest einen Desktop Modus bekommt wo man auch den normalen Bildschirm einblenden kann. Aber die VR Umgebung von Steam ist allgemein auch eher mau.Empfehlen kann ich z.B. Virtual Desktop (rund 15€ für Steam als auch Oculus Home beziehbar aber man müsste es 2 mal zahlen wenn man es in beiden Umgebungen haben möchte oder manuell einbinden)Eine Leap Motion Handerkennung konnte ichbisher noch nicht erfolgreich einbinden aber das kommt noch, aber bisher würde ich sagen SPART ES EUCH die Einbindung ist extrem lästig!Außerdem kann ich nur wärmstens den VorpX Treiber empfehlen. Kostet zwar Geld, aber ermöglichst fast JEDE Dreidimensionale Renderumgebung als stereoskopische Anwendung in die VR einzubinden! Man kann zwischen headtracking und Screen Ansicht umschalten, achtet darauf immer eine 4:3 oder besser 5:4 Auflösung einzustellen oder schaltet den Stretchmodus vom Treiber um für beste Ergebnisse! Die Controller funktionieren in Spielen als reine Tastaturergänzung, man kann alle Buttons mindestens doppelt Belegen und mit einem Druck des linken Mittelfingers zwischen den Belegungen hin und herschalten. Die belegten Tasten sind in der VR Umgebung auf die entsprechenden Tasten gemappt falls man die Belegung mal vergessen hat. Ich haeb allerdings bisher keine Kopplung von Controller Bewegung im Raum und dem Spiel erlebt!ACHTUNG VorpX unterstützt zur Zeit keinen Multimonitor im Theatermodus, da wird die Maus falsch gerendert, also nur einen Monitor anklemmen!daher 4 Sterne weil man ein klein wenig extra Geld in die Hand nehmen muss um den Genuss zu maximieren!

Quand on est à fond dedans et qu’on voit ses mains complètement bugger, ça gâche tout ...Commentaire original :J'adore, je suis vraiment scotché de la qualité du produit, ça fait vraiment premium.- le packaging est génial, vraiment bien présenté- le produit est beau (vraiment, je le trouve magnifique)- l'installation est facile, vérifiez simplement que vous avez assez de ports (3 ports USB 3.0 de préférence et 1 port HDMI)- les manettes sont géniales, bien mieux que celles des concurrents, je pense notamment aux nouveaux casques de chez Microsoft (Mixed Reality), de plus elles se connectent toutes seul, pas besoin de les allumer ou autre, nécessite une seule pile par manette, et la batterie tiens très bien, là où les casques de Microsoft nécessite 2 piles par manette, et la durée de vie est vraiment moyenne.Seul inconvénient des manettes : les vibrations sont super bruyantesEn terme de contenu, c'est super, pas mal de jeux gratuits, je joue beaucoup à Rec Room qui est une appli sociale avec des jeux (Paintball, RPG, etc ...) et c'est vraiment incroyable de rencontrer des gens, leur parler, comme si de rien était, jouer avec, etc ... vraiment j'adore.A 400€, c'est vraiment génial, rien que pour la qualité du produit, je ne suis pas déçu de cet achat, un beau cadeau de Noël que je me suis fait.

Ich habe die Oculus zu vor bei nem Kumpel testen können. War richtig geil. VR ist einfach hammer. Hab nen paar Tage gewartet und mir auch eine bestellt, soweit so gut. Kam recht schnell an und die Konfiguration ging recht schnell und problemlos. Hatte damit 3-4 h richitg spaß.Kurze Pause gemacht und wollte nun weiter Spielen. Oculus gab kein Zeichen von sich und ging nicht mehr an. Nach kurzer google Suche das Problem gefunden. Ein Kontakt im HDMI Stecker hat sich, warum auch immer, zurückgedrückt.Ärgerlich aber okay kann ja mal passieren. Retoure geschickt und recht zügig neue Rift bekommen. Dirket den HDMI-Stecker überprüft. Er ist exakt an der selben Stelle defekt und zurückgedrückt wie bei der ersten Rift, also das ist wirklich alles andere als geil und das für den Preis. Dies problem scheinen laut Rift Forum diverse Leute zu haben, die Einträge waren teilweise von 2016 also ein offensichtlich bekanntes Problem was sie immer noch nicht im Griff haben. Erstmal wird es für mich keine Rift mehr geben. Bilder füge ich hinzu. Ich hoffe man erkennt es mit der Schärfe hat es semi gut geklappt.

Honestly, Before I bought a VR headset I hadn’t tried one. I thought for a long time that this was probably another gimmick. Perhaps it would be like taping little LCD screens to my eye lids.I was completly wrong. This thing makes you feel like you’re actually in the game your playing. Pretty amazing.I would say more but unfortuantly I let the misses borrow it and haven’t been able to get it back ha!

Rift acheté en août 2017 pour 450€. Review mise à jour au 06/08/2018 (spoiler : le fond reste le même).Je ne peux pas faire de comparaison avec d'autres casques VR haut de gamme mais je peux déjà dire que comparé à un casque pour smartphone, c'est le jour et la nuit ! Voici quelques points que j'aimerais éclaircir en espérant répondre à vos questionnements. Ne lisez que les points qui vous intéressent !- Le screendoor effect :Plus prononcé qu'avec un smartphone quadHD, il est plus ou moins visible selon les applications. La résolution d'écran est la deuxième grosse limite actuelle de cette techno (voir confort et nausée) et cela vous empêchera parfois de lire des textes sans vous griller les yeux ou de profiter vraiment de vos films en VR. En jeu on l'oublie très vite. Et puis la résolution est adaptée aux ordinateurs actuels, faire tourner des jeux dans une résolution encore plus élevée à 90fps vous demanderait un PC ultra haut de gamme.-Le flou :Ce ne sont pas vraiment les pixels qui sont gênants en jeu mais plutôt le flou. Celui ci peut être atténué en activant le super-sampling, ce qui fera tourner vos jeux dans une résolution encore plus grande que la résolution native du casque. C'est très gourmand et peu efficace. Certains titres colorés comme Lucky's Tale s'en sortent pourtant admirablement et ne paraissent pas flou du tout. Au fait, myopes, il vous faudra vos lunettes dans le casque !-Les god rays :Ce sont ce genre de lumière que vous voyez percer entre les arbres en forêt lorsque l'air est chargé de particules. C'est assez magique quand c'est voulu mais dans l'Oculus c'est une tare. Lorsque vous regardez quelque chose de clair sur fond noir (typiquement un texte blanc) vous verrez ces rayons de lumière polluer votre vision, parfois assez agressivement (ça plus le flou, les longues lectures sont à proscrire). Encore une fois, en jeu on l'oublie rapidement, mais c'est à noter et c'est dû à la lentille du Rift. L'effet est accentué lorsqu'elle est sale.-Le confort global :Tout de suite, j'ai été impressionné par le confort et la légèreté du casque ! Le fait que l'audio soit intégré est d'ailleurs un vrai plus ! (au passage, le rendu sonore et tout à fait correcte). Par contre, j'ai très vite vu que je n'y voyais rien sans mes lunettes... Or le casque n'est pas énorme et mes lunettes entrent à peine. Elles sont un peu entravée dans le casque et sales, participent à l'effet de god rays.Mais surtout, et c'est le 1er inconvénient du Rift, il chauffe vite et fort, sur le dessus. Rien de bien méchant sauf quand il fait un peu trop chaud. Typiquement l'été, on se retrouve très rapidement à transpirer, avec parfois de la buée sur les lunettes (ne pas serrer trop le casque). Cela exclue d'emblée toute utilisation intensive/systématique du casque, d'autant plus qu'à cet inconfort physique peut venir s'ajouter la nausée.Mes lunettes : Tommy Hilfiger TH 1136 4K1-La nausée :Etant tout à fait étranger à cette notion de cinétose, je me suis engagé dans la VR en me disant que rien de tout cela ne m'affecterai. Que nenni ! La moindre latence remarquable, la moindre perte de tracking se fera ressentir dans le cerveau. En effet, point de sentiment de nausée stomacale mais plutôt un mal être au niveau crânien. Cependant si tout est bien réglé, il est tout à fait possible de passer plusieurs heures sans ressentir le moindre mal.C'est au niveau du parti pris par les développeurs qu'il faut se méfier. En effet ma pire expérience a finalement été Google Earth ! Pouvoir avancer à grande vitesse tout en se déplacent de côté me fut fatal. De même être assis empire la chose. Privilégiez les déplacements à base de téléportation ou qui vous forcent à aller vers l'avant/arrière mais vous demandent de tourner avec votre propre corps.Cela fait un an que j'ai le casque, je suis devenu un peu plus dur à ce mal ! (j'ai aussi une carte graphique plus puissante qu'avant qui me donne peut être plus de fluidité, une 1060 6Go)-360° et roomscale avec ce kitAvec les deux capteurs inclus dans ce kit il est tout à fait possible de se créer un setup en roomscale, c'est à dire dans lequel on peut se déplacer physiquement et se tourner dans le sens que l'on veut ! Cette option est supportée nativement par Oculus Home et se paramètre très facilement. C'est absolument indispensable selon moi pour jouir vraiment de ce qu'offre cette technologie. Les meilleurs jeux en tirent partie, ce serait dommage de ne pas l'utiliser ! Cependant la ""room"" que l'on peut créer avec ces capteurs fera difficilement plus de 2.30m² ce qui est moins bien que le Vive, mais on peut l'augmenter avec un 3ème capteur en option (l'intérêt est limité, 2m² sont suffisants pour tous les jeux). Aussi il vous faudra vous munir d'au moins une rallonge USB.-Le câblage :Gourmand en câbles, l'Oculus vous demandera 3 ports USB ainsi qu'un port HDMI. J'ai personnellement opté pour une carte PCIe USB 3.0 ainsi qu'une rallonge de type USB 3.0 mais il est possible que le Rift fonctionne en 2.0. Cependant Oculus recommande le 3.0 pour de meilleures performances. A voir. Le câble reliant le Rift à l'ordinateur est suffisamment long pour le roomscale mais a tendance à s'enrouler sur lui même. Les câbles des capteurs font environ 3 m.la carte : Inateck Carte PCI-E (USB 3.0) rouge 4*USB3.0la rallonge : AmazonBasics Rallonge Câble USB 3.0 mâle A vers femelle A 3 m-Compatibilité avec Steam VR :La technologie utilisée par Steam VR étant open source, l'Oculus est compatible avec tout le catalogue VR sur Steam. Ceci dit l'utilisation est peu pratique puisqu'il faut faire tourner Oculus Home, Steam VR et le jeu auquel vous voulez jouer. Il faut également paramétrer la VR sur Steam en plus des paramètres fait sur l'Oculus Home. Les erreurs de dialogues entre les deux api sont fréquentes et certains titres sont parfois récalcitrants. Mais principalement cela marche. La plupart des jeux sont directement optimisés pour les contrôleurs Touch et ceux qui ne le sont pas sont tout de même jouables, passé la confusion d'avoir des contrôleurs Vives virtuels dans ses mains.-Les Touch :Principale atout du Rift par rapport à son concurrent direct (le Vive a les mêmes spécifications) les Touchs sont designés pour marier manette traditionnelle et simulation de main virtuelle. Leur confort et le positionnement de leurs touches rappellent la manette XboxOne. Mais ils font plus, ils sont capables de repérer vos doigts dans l'espace ainsi que de savoir si vous touchez ou non vos boutons. Cela permet de tendre le doigt (pouces et indexes seulement) et de visualiser exactement quels boutons vous effleurez (pas encore d'application pratique pour cela). Les touch ne demande qu'une pile LR6 chaquns et ne sont pas gourmand du tout. On aurait pu préférer une batterie mais libre à vous d'utiliser des piles rechargeables, et puis ce n'est pas comme si jouer en filaire en attendant que la batterie se recharge pouvait être une option; bon point donc.-Les jeux, l'intérêt :Pour l'instant la librairie de jeux est déjà assez conséquente mais il faut bien avouer que la plupart de ces titres sont mineurs. Les 6 ""jeux"" qui m'étaient proposés en bundle vont de la simple expérience au hit d'arcade (Robot Recall est excellent !) mais ne suffiront pas à assouvir votre soif. Il manque encore à la VR les grosses productions qui poussent à faire acheter une machine. Quelques portages (jeux de course, Fallout 4, Skyrim, LA Noire...) commencent à offrir de belles perspectives mais les limites de design (comment adapter les déplacements nécessaires à un jeu au niveau de nausée provoqué) et de prix d'entrée (plus le PC pour le faire tourner) font que cette techno reste un marché de niche. Sony et son PSVR et les baisses de prix du Rift et du VIVE n'ont pas encore convaincus le grand publique.Alors cela vaut il le coup ? Clairement le rapport prix/temps de jeu ne sera pas en faveur d'un achat. Acheter un casque VR n'est pas pour l'instant un acte rationnel. C'est un achat de passionné. Si comme moi vous avez toujours rêvé de tomber dans la matrice alors sauter le pas ne parait pas insensé. Après tout, si le prix est élevé (et les jeux aussi sont chers mais comme partout il y a les soldes, achetez malin) il n'est pas complètement déraisonnable désormais. Si les jeux vidéo sont votre passion, si vous cherchez quelque chose de nouveau, une façon de jouer qui ne soit pas qu'un gimmick (on est loin des wiimotes, là c'est du sérieux, du précis) il me parait même tout à fait logique de craquer !Conclusion !!!J'ai des choses à reprocher à ce Rift, que je pourrais sans doute reprocher également au Vive. Il fait partie de ce que l'on appelle déjà la première génération, preuve que la suite est attendue de pied ferme. La technologie est vraiment au point, elle demande simplement du raffinement. Elle demande aussi que les développeurs la domptent. Bref, Un Rift CV1 c'est comme le tout premier iPhone, une révolution, même si il aura fallu encore du temps pour que l'industrie du smartphone raffine le concept. Ceci dit l'Oculus à mis du temps à sortir ses Touch, ils sont le résultat d'une longue R&D qui en font le produit le plus abouti du moment et encore pour l'instant.Alors oui c'est un investissement. On peut faire le choix de la VR plutôt que d'acheter des machines pour nostalgiques ou des machines portables ! Ça ne remplacera pas votre bon vieil écran, il faut le voir comme une plateforme plutôt qu'un périphérique, mais vous aurez une vraie attraction à la maison !PS: La prochaine génération de casques ne devrait pas débarquer avant 2020 chez Oculus. Chez HTC, le Vive Pro est plutôt une variante haut de gamme et corrigée, mais à un prix sensiblement trop élevé.

Ich möchte hier meine Erfahrungen mit der Oculus Rift teilen als jemand mit einer Sehbehinderung. Ich leide unter wechselseitigem Schielen kann daher nicht räumlich (stereoskopisch) sehen. VR Brillen wie die Rift setzen aber eigentlich räumliches Sehen voraus.Trotz dieser Behinderung empfinde ich VR als ein immersives Erlebnis. Die Darstellung von Größen die der Realität entsprechen und die Umsetzung der Kopfbewegungen täuschen das Gehirn so das ich tatsächlich das Gefühl habe in einer anderen Umgebung zu stehen. Ich kann also jedem mit einer Sehbehinderung empfehlen VR trotzdem einmal auszuprobieren. Die Bilddarstellung empfinde ich zwar nicht richtig scharf aber ich vermute das liegt weniger an meiner Sehbehinderung als vielmehr an der geringen Auflösung der verwendeten Displays.Das sogenannte Fliegengitter unter denen alle VR Brillen der ersten Generation (die PSVR soll hier noch am wenigsten betroffen sein aufgrund einer anderen Displaytechnologie) empfand ich persönlich nicht als störend und es wird schnell vom Gehirn ausgeblendet.Was mich jedoch stört sind die sogenannten God Rays das sind Strahlenbündel die durch die verwendeten Fresnel Linsen bei hohen Kontrasten entstehen z.B. weiße Schrift auf schwarzen Hintergrund. Bei der Rift sind diese Strahlenbündel ziemlich stark ausgeprägt, bei Spielen stört das meist weniger weil hier selten so starke Kontraste vorkommen aber wenn man sich Filme auf einer großen VR Leinwand anschaut ist dieser Effekt ziemlich stark wahrzunehmen und stört das Erlebnis.Das Display ist bei schwarzen Hintergründen auch nicht wirklich schwarz sondern bei mir unterschiedlich hell. Bei mir sieht das aus wie so eine Sinuskurve wobei der obere Teil der Sinuskurve dunkler und der untere Teil heller ist. Ich weiß nicht ob das ein Fehler im Display ist oder allgemein ein Problem bei OLED Displaytechnologie ist.Grundsätzlich bin ich von der VR Erfahrung dennoch recht positiv überrascht das mittendrin Gefühl ist einzigartig und ich vermute mit zukünftigen Generationen ohne Fliegengitter und God Rays wird sich diese Technik auch im Massenmarkt durchsetzen allein das Potential Filme auf einer riesigen virtuellen Leinwand in einem virtuellen Kinosaal zu sehen ist unglaublich.

Installation unter Windows 7 sehr hakelig. Das Installationsprogram verlangt ein gewisses Windows 7 Update, was vorhanden sein muss. Das Problem ist wohl, dass dieses Update inzwischen kein einzellnes Update mehr ist, sondern irgenwo mal mit implementiert wurde. Jetzt denkt das Installationsprogramm, dass dies nicht vorhanden sei. Das Programm führt einem zwar auf die Windowsseite, will man die Updates jedoch manuell installieren wird gesagt, sie seien bereits installiert. Man muss das Installationsprogram austricksen, indem eine Verknüpfung des Installationsprograms erstellt wird und im Ziel D:\OculusSetup.exe /bypassHotfixCheck eingefügt wird. Dies steht nur in irgendeinem Forum, aber nicht auf der offiziellen Oculus Helpseite. Sehr schwach. der 2. Knackpunkt ist, dass man mind 14 GB Festplattenspeicher auf der Systemplatte braucht. Man kann zwar das Installationsverzeichnis laut offizieller Supportseite ändern, es ist aber falsch beschrieben:Gib Folgendes ein: OculusSetup /drive: [neues Systemlaufwerk] (Beispiel: OculusSetup /drive:D) FALSCH! und zwar darf man zw /drive und dem Laufwerksbuchstaben KEIN Doppelpunkt schreiben. Es muss also OculusSetup /drive D heißen, ansonsten passiert nämlich NICHTS beim Ausführen.Diese beiden Sachen haben bei mir Frust hervorgerufen. Ich kann also nicht von einem perfekten ersten Eindruck sprechen und gebe darum nur 4 Sterne.Hat man den holprigen Start überwunden, läuft es bei mir jedenfalls ohne Probleme und ich bin wirklich davon beeindruckt, wie verzögerungsfrei alles funktioniert, die Controller bzw die Gegenstände die man dann in der Hand hällt und natürlich die spielumgebung selbst. Bewegt man die Hande oder schaut sich um, reagiert alles sofort und man hat, wenn man zum ersten Mal ein Spiel startet einen ziemlich WOW effekt. Ein kleiner Dämpfer ist leider immer eine gewisse Unschärfe. In dem Kostenlosen Spiel Robot Recal (was richtig Spaß macht) ist es zum Beispiel nicht möglich, den Klappentextes eines umherliegendem virtuellen Buches zu lesen. DIe Vorderseite allerdings schon. Liegt eventuell daran, das die Texturen nicht allzu gut aufgelöst sind in dem Spiel. Und man sieht auch die Einzelnen Pixel des Bildschirm. Dies kann auf jeden Fall in der zukunft der VR-Brillen noch verbessert werden, indem ein hochauflösenderes Display verbaut wird. im Großen und ganzen stört das allerdings nicht.Bei der Einrichtung wird zunächst der Spielbereich definiert, indem mit dem Controller ein Quadtrat gezogen wird. Ingame erscheint dann sehr beeindruckend dieser Umriss, der gezeichnet wurde, sobald man dem Ende des definierten Spielbereiches zu nahe kommt. Man muss trotzdem aufpassen, denn man sieht dieses an das Star Trak Holodeck erinnernde Raster erst, wenn der Controller ca 30cm davor gehalten wird. Es kann also sein, dass wenn man schon relativ nah an der Wand steht, das Gitter jedoch noch nicht angezeigt wird und schwungvoll richtig Wand haut, der Controller trotzdem die Wand berührt. Also sollte man immer noch selbet etwas Abstand zur Wand lassen beim Markieren des Bereiches.Fazit: Für mich mit die beste Anschaffung, die ich je für den PC gemacht habte. Es macht halt unglaublich Spaß, den Kugeln der Gegner wirklich ausweichen zu müssen, indem man sich wegduckt oder zur Seite sich bewegt, oder mit diversen mittealterlichen Waffen die Gegner zu verprügeln (Spiel GORN) Pluspunkt ist natürlich auch, dass man sich beim Zocken nun auch bewegen muss, was wirklich auch mal anstrengend sein kann, anstatt nur zu sitzen.

Ich stand sehr kritisch dieser VR Brillen gegenüber. Ich glaubte, dass die Werbung wieder viel zu viel versprechen. Ich habe mir vor einer Woche die Brille mir selbst zum Weihnachten geschenkt. Als ich die Brille aufgesetzt hatte, war ich positiv überrascht.Das Installieren der Hardware und Software verlief problemlos. Das Setup-Programm muss man sich von der Oculus-Seite herunterladen. In der Verpackung sucht man vergeblich nach einer CD/DVD. Das Setup hat ein gut verständiges, teilweise mit Videos, Step-to-Step-Verfahren. Vorher ist ein Konto bei Oculus notwendig.Es gibt hier viele 1-Sterne-Bewertungen wegen Datenschutz-Bedenken. Dies kann ich nicht ganz nachvollziehen, denn solche Konten sind heute an vielen Stellen üblich, angefangen bei Amazon, ups hier das ist ja Amazon! Bei Amazon mache ich mir mehr Gedanken über Datenschutz, Kaufverhalten, Kosumverhalten, Alexa etc.Auf jeden Fall war das Setup einfach durchzulaufen, ALLERDINGS sollte man sich Zeit dafür nehmen, ca. für Neulingen 2 Stunden.WICHTIG: Vor dem Kauf sollte man die Hardware-Voraussetzung prüfen und etvl. die Hardware vom PC aufrüsten, z.B. in meinem Fall eine leistungsfähigere Graphikkarte mit entsprechende Anschlüssen und zusätzliche USB 3.0(!!!)-Anschlüsse (einige haben hier geschrieben, dass USB 2.0 auch ausreicht).Wichtig bei dieser Sache ist, vorallem bei Brillenträger, dass die VR Brille richtig eingestellt ist. Wer voller Ungeduld einfach die Brille aufsetzt, ist zwar begeistert, bekommt aber schnell Kopfschmerzen. Stellt man die Brille in Ruhe richtig ein, dann kann man stundenlang in der VR verbringen.Der Umfang an Software (Games) für Oculus (kostenlose und kostenpflichtige) ist zwar groß, aber man merkt, dass es noch am Anfang des VR-Zeitalters ist. Es gibt zwar nette Games, aber es sind keine Bockbuster wie im ""realen"" PC-Welt. Große Erwartungen sollte man hier noch(!!!) nicht haben. Aber da ich die Brille erst eine Woche habe, kann es sein, dass mir doch das eine oder andere besonderes. ""Eagle Flight"" gefällt mir z.B. gar nicht, da wird mir schlecht davon :))))Über den Preis lässt man sich streiten. Ich finde, in Anbetracht der Hardware und der Oculus-Software, den Preis nicht übertrieben. Mann muss jedoch bewußt sein, dass dies ein reines Spielzeug für Erwchsene ist. Man kann zwar versuchen, einen sinnvollen Nutzen daraus zu gewinnen, aber ich habe bisher keinen gefunden.

La techno est pas mal mais la resolution est encore un peut faible, meme si au bout d'un moment on s'y fait. Les sensations sont bien la, les manettes touch sont TRES ergonomiques et tres reactives. Le gros bemol c'est quand meme le cable, apres 10 ans de jeu sans fil c'est vraiment une plaie de se coltiner cela à nouveau, penser à utiliser le rift en chausettes ou pied nu car vous risquez de ne pas sentir le fil en marchand dessus.Dernier gros mauvais point, si comme moi vous avez une grosse tete et des lunettes: passez votre chemin, meme avec des lunettes aux bonne dimensions, le rift va vous tasser vos lorgnons dans le visage et la mousse ne lessera pas passer l'air=condensation sur les lunettes ou les lentilles de l'appareil... j'ai du le reexpedier pour cela d'ailleur... ma femme qui a une tête moins grosse et des amis à lunettes l'on essayé et les retours d'experience sont confortable/ plutot confortable.je vais finir par un point positif, le store oculus est plein à rabord de jeu et experience vr gratuites, sans compter que la possession de manettes touch vous donne acces a 2 des meilleurs jeux VR ainsi qu'a des programes de dessin en 3D et de sculpture vraiment extra, jai eu le temps de tester la nouvelle interface de l'oculus le ""dash"" waouh, on se croirait dans un film de SF.

J'ai longuement hésité à m'immerger dans la réalité virtuelle, pourtant étant piqué par les jeux vidéos depuis ma plus jeune enfance, dès les premières prémisses de casques VR j'étais comme un enfant face à l'un de ses rêve vidéoludique les plus fous, mais je me retenais de me lancer dedans pour plusieurs raisons:- Modèles expérimentaux- Hors de prix au lancement- Pas assez de contenu concrets pour les joueurs, les premiers modèles étant orientés développeursMais après avoir attendu plusieurs années tout en observant l'évolution des jeux et logiciels proposés mais également du Hardware, l'Oculus Rift dans sa forme actuelle avait atteint un stade plus qu’alléchant mais un brin trop cher.. Jusqu'à ce que Facebook fourre son nez dans ce marché prometteur et rachète l'Oculus Rift (je n'aime pas particulièrement Facebook, loin de là, mais..) pour changer complètement la politique de vente:Réduire énormément la marge de vente sur le Hardware, démocratiser le matériel pour étendre son public, en vendre BEAUCOUP plus et attirer les développeurs en herbe, et le tout en sortant ce fameux pack au tarif défiant toute concurrence!Je l'ai maintenant depuis un peu plus de deux mois et j'en suis ravis, l'immersion est totale et incroyable, le casque est d'une ergonomie irréprochable et conçu pour un confort optimal pour tout type de morphologie, on en oublierais même que l'on porte un casque sur de longues sessions de jeux immersifs! (Je peux jouer facilement 3-4h de suite sans aucun vertige, nausée, ni douleur ou fatigue oculaire.)La précision des Oculus Touch ainsi que leur prise en main est incroyable, ayant essayé l'HTC Vive plusieurs fois auparavant (qui est également un excellent casque), l'ergonomie et la conception des Oculus Touch est clairement supérieur en tout point de mon point de vue, et je suis loin d'être le seul à être de cet avis!J'ai pu joué à énormément de jeux depuis cet acquisition (et la plupart sur Steam et non l'Oculus Store, 0 problèmes de compatibilité à ce niveau au contraire), que cela soit Space Pirate Trainer en passant par Skyrim ou encore Pavlov, Onward, Sareinto ou l'incroyable Beat Saber qui fait parler de lui depuis début mai, ce casque est de loin l'expérience vidéoludique la plus jouissive et la plus grosse claque que j'ai pu ressentir depuis cette dernière décennie. Et si vous n'êtes pas vraiment jeux vidéos, quoi de mieux que de regarder sa série préférée sur un écran géant digne des plus grand cinémas au milieu d'une forêt le tout installé confortablement dans son fauteuil, et qui sait même avec un ou plusieurs amis? (BigScreen)Et pour ceux qui se posent la question, ne vous inquiétez pas, même si vous transpirer, le casque est conçu pour et mes longues sessions de Beat Saber en Expert ou de Box VR (1h-1h30 intensive) se sont résultés par une douche obligatoire, et une sacrée séance de Fitness, (1014 calories brûlées en 1h30 de Beat Saber en Expert mode, le tout calculé avec une montre POLAR M430 étant tout de même conçu pour le running et le fitness, donc précise.) et si vraiment vous souhaitez transpirer sans vous préoccuper d’endommager la mousse de l'interface faciale fournie avec le casque, je vous invite à jeter un coup d’œil à VR Cover qui font d'excellent interface de visage pour Oculus Rift avec housse en tissu lavable en machine, et là tout est parfait!Bref, n'hésitez pas plus longtemps, du fun, de l'immersion, des sensations incroyables à en avoir des frissons, du sport, en sommes, le futur est là, et c'est à trois clics de chez vous, et le tout sera installé et prêt à utiliser en une demie heure chrono. ;)Dernier info, ma config actuelle: GTX 970, 32Go de RAM, i7 5820k @ 3.30Ghz et sous Windows 10 64-bit, absolument tous les jeux ou applications sont extrêmement fluides avec tous les paramètres poussés au taquet.N'hésitez plus, lancez vous.Akhrian.

++ Sehr intensiver Eindruck- Hohe Hardwareanforderung (Meine ist: GTX1060, i5-8400 und 16GB-3200)- Aufbau erfordert immer etwas Zeit- Softwareinstallation war bei mir (Windows 7 x64) nur über Umwege möglich- Viele Titel sind lieblos zusammengeklatscht, ob schnell Geld zu machen. (Ist zwar kein Mängel der Rift, sondern aller VR Brillen)-- Viele Exklusivtitel (z.B. From other suns) verhindern eine Entwicklung von guten Titeln, die notwendig wären, damit VR massentauglich wirdFazit:Wer den Platz, die Hardware und das Geld für die Titel hat, kann einiges an Unterhaltung bekommen. Das Bild ist nicht ganz scharf. Aber dies stört nur, wenn man kleine Schrift lesen oder Details erkennen muss. Da kommen die ""unangepassten"" Titel wieder ins Spiel.

Ich habe mir diese Brille gekauft, weil ich den aktuellen Preis OK finde und auch bereits einen High-End Gaming PC besitze. Die Installation der Brille bzw. der Sensoren war einfach und dann ging es auch schon los.Viele die noch keine VR-Brille auf hatten sagen, dass die jetzige Generation bestimmt nicht so toll ist bzw. dass es sich nicht lohnt. Ich habe mir auch überlegt, ob ich lieber noch eine Generation warte aber ich konnte nicht widerstehen. Bis auf die Pixeldichte (recht gering aber fällt während man in die VR eintaucht nicht so stark auf) gibt es nichts zu beanstanden! Schon jetzt ein tolles VR-Erlebnis. Das E-Sportspiel ""Sparc"" habe ich für mich entdeckt, ich liebe es und werde sicher noch viele Stunden mit der VR-Brille verbringen!

I decided this generation of VR wasn't for me back when both systems were around $800, as I thought that price point was too high for the amount of value and content you received (especially on the Oculus side). When I checked over a year later and saw that the price had been cut in half, the Xbox controller had been replaced with Touch, an extra sensor was included, and 8+ games were given away for free, I decided to pull the trigger. I am honestly blown away.IMHO: The screen door effect people talk about is definitely there, but only noticeable during loading screens/when you're not immersed in a game. Tracking is wonderful with 2 sensors, and flawless with 3 (if you're in a larger room like me). Touch is the most ergonomic and intuitive controller system I have ever used. Switching from an XBone Controller and Dualshock 4 to Touch was a night and day difference. Between Steam VR and the Oculus store there are tons of great games and experiences available, and more coming out every week. The main negatives I have noticed are the length of the cords coming from the headset (which I am fixing by buying extensions), the quality of the foam around the headset (seems to pick up and hold sweat/makeup, fixing with WidmoVR cover), and the heat produced by the headset during longer play sessions (doesn't have an easy fix other than pointing a fan at yourself during play). I can live with all of these things given that it is still a first generation technology.Overall, I can sum up my thoughts with this: The first time I reached over my shoulders and pulled out my dual shotguns in Robo Recall, the laughter of amazement coming from my mouth completely drowned out the sobbing of despair coming from my bank account.

Absolutely fantastic. Have bought the HTC Vive for myself as a present - it does not compare one bit. The Vive was blurry, full of godrays while this is crystal clear. Have tried to adjust both the IPD and the lense distance, made no difference - tried every suggestion I could find. Only tracking is miles better, but this can be sorted with an extra sensor on the Oculus.

seit ich irgendwan um 2014 herum von der Existenz einer virtuellen Realität erfahren habe hegte ich den Wunsch so ein Teil zu besitzen, grenzenlose möglichkeiten vor allem im Bereich pornografie bzw cyber sex xD Erste VR Erlebnisse hatte man eigentlich schon damals im Kino, da hab ich mir den Film Avatar und the live of Pi in 3D angesehen :3 In der Zeit vor VR waren cyan-rot anaglyph Brillen angesagt, aber viele videos gab es nicht und man musste lange danach suchen. Als VR Brillen 2016 auf den markt kahmen war die Freude groß, aber es war auch eine enttäuschung weil die oculus rift und die vive mehr als 800€ gekostet haben und das Software Angebot sich in grenzen hielt, seither hat sich viel getan und auch heute noch gibt es überwiegend Tech-demos doch das software Angebot steigt langsam sodas es sich inzwischen lohnt. Am Preis gibt es jetzt auch nichts mehr zu meckern, mit microsft neuer software mixed reality sind VR Brillen nun schon ab 280€ erhältlich , wer also noch keine VR Brille hat ist selber schuld :3+Es gibt viele Software Angebote auf Steam, dazu müsst ihr das Programm Steam VR instalieren+Programme wie Virtual Desktop erlauben euch die oculus als Windows Bildschirm zu benutzen, das heist ihr könnt auch all eure nicht-VR programme in der oculus öffnen und eure normalen videos anschauen. der Vorteil ist ihr könnt den Desktop hochskalieren das er euer gesammtes Gesichtsfeld ausfüllt :3+Die Hardware um die oculus rift betreiben zu können ist erschwinglich geworden, bei mir läuft das gerät einwandfrei auf höchsten einstellungen mit einem 8-Kern AMD fx9370 CPU, 16GB DDR3 Arbeitsspeicher, eine Seagate SSHD FireCuda Festplatte und einer nvidea GTX1060 Grafikkarte mit einem 800€ PC seid ihr also bestens ausgerüstet.+alles in allem ist VR eine ganz neue erfahrung, schon alleine weil man sich bewegt und im stehen spielt :3+Die oculus Rift ist sehr gut geeignet für Brillenträger+Die mitgelieferten Spiele werden euch die ersten 3 Monate gut beschäftigen :3-man kann damit nicht den ganzen Tag zocken, man sollte alle zwei stunden eine halbe stunde pause machen :)-nicht für Kinder unter 13 Jahren oder epileptiker geeignet-DIe augengläser sind nur Mittig ganz scharf, wenn man mit den augen zu den Rändern schaut dann wirkt das Bild verschwommen. Mann sollte die Augen möglichst  mittig lassen, dafür aber den Kopf drehen.-Das Bild ist immer etwas pixelig weil die Auflösung nicht höher geht, um ein realistischer pixelfreies Bild zu bekommen bräuchte man schätzungweise eine Auflösung von 12000p lol. Aber man hat sich schnell daran gewöhnt-Für Kinder auch deshalb nicht geeignet, weil es sich um sensible Hardware handelt. Wenn man die Brille 1-2 mal fallen lässt dann geht sie mit sicherheit kaputt. auch darf weder die Brille noch die Sensoren oder die Controller mit Wasser in berührung kommen. Einmal Kaffee drüber gießen ist ein garantiertes Todesurteil.~zu der Haltbarkeit kann ich nichts sagen, ich glaube aber die oculus rift ist ein hochwertiges und langlebiges produkt man muss nur gut damit umgehen :)

Le sentiment majeur après l'essai c'était : ""Whaw, pourquoi j'ai pas acheté ce truc plus tôt !"" l'immersion est totale, la qualité des images est top, la fluidité les détails, le sentiment de présence ... génial !Attention toutefois : grosse config nécessaire. Perso un vieux i7 4770, 16go RAM, un crossfire de R9 270 font l'affaire (bien que l'appli ne détectant qu'une carte graphique m'informe que ma config est insuffisante) même si je dois OC les cartes, le résultat est bluffant. Les réglages sont un peu tatillons, mais une fois achevés c'est top. Enfin je dirais qu'il manque un ou deux mètres de câble sur le casque et les sensors car suivant la pièce le PC peut très bien être assez loin. Je conseille également l'achat d'un kit pour suspendre les câbles car en se baissant on peut très bien marcher sur fil, ... Et en se relevant tout arracher ! Conseil aussi : effectuer si possible vos premiers essais avec quelqu'un qui vous assiste.

Meine erste Brille mußte ich leider zurückgeben, sie hatte einen blauen Strich auf dem linken Display. Die Rückgabe hat sehr lange gedauert, habe fast eine Monat gewartet, bis ich das Geld zurück bekommen habe.Die nächste Brille funktioniert einwandfrei. Für 444 Euro funktioniert die Brille mit den Touch Controlern einwandfrei. Ich hab dazu noch einen weiteren Sensor beim Hersteller bestellt (Achtung, auf Amazon werden hier völlig überteuerte Sensoren angeboten) und es war auch noch nötig eine USB 3.0 Karte zusätzlich einzubauen, weil die Brille hohe Anforderungen stellt an USB Verbindungen (jeder Sensor braucht einen usb 3.0 Anschluss und die Brille selber auch noch einen, das wird bei den meisten Rechner knapp.Hier hab ich nur mit der Inateck KTU3FR-4P USB 3.0 keine Probleme gehabt, mußte vorher 2 andere Karten wieder zurückgeben.Eine VR-Brille verursacht bei manchen Leuten schnell Übelkeit, je nach Anwendungen, daher sollte man sowas vorher mal ausprobieren.Die Anzahl der Programme, die gut funktionieren ist auch noch sehr begrenzt, aber es gibt ein paar Anwendungen, die so eine Investition wirklich lohnenswert machen.Alles in allem bin ich zufrieden, diese Brille ist im Vergleich zu anderen immer noch das Beste, was es aktuell gibt. Daher volle Punktzahl.Sehr bedenkenswert ist allerdings der Datenschutz, das sollte man sich sehr genau anschauen, auf was man sich da einlässt. Hier kann man ohne extrem genaue Kenntnisse kaum vor der Unverschämtheit der Hersteller schützen, man hat fast keine Chance, nicht alles von sich preiszugeben, was man tut, was man hat, wer man ist und wie oft man was mit der Brille macht. Das ist für mich fast schon ein Killkriterium die Brille überhaupt zu benutzen.

J'ai ce casque depuis quelques jours, il était en promo, j'ai craqué.Il est très bien, c'est vraiment sympa avec les deux manettes, j'avais eu l'occasion d'utiliser le casque VR de Playstation, mais celui la est un cran au dessus !En revanche, deux points négatifs que j'ai trouvé.Je m'attendais à avoir des écrans un peu plus nets que ceux du casque PS4, mais... Au final, non, je ne vois pas de différence, il y a toujours ces petits pixels que l'ont voit.Et... étant porteur de lunettes... C'est à chaque fois la galère pour mettre le casque.Il faut que j'enlève mes lunettes, que je les places à l'intérieur du casque, et que je mette ensuite le casque et les lunettes d'un coup.C'est très chiant.Par contre, une fois le casque mis, les lunettes ne me gênent pas, j'avais lu pas mal de commentaires sur internet disant qu'il n'était pas confortable pour les porteurs de lunettes, mais... Ca ne me dérange pas plus que ça.Forcement, ce serait mieux sans lunettes, mais à part la mise en place, le reste va bien !Après une heure d'utilisation non-stop, pas de mal au nez à cause de mes lunettes de vue, ni aux tempes (contrairement à ce que certains sites disent. Ca doit dépendre beaucoup de la morphologie).Pas de mal aux yeux, pas de sécheresse oculaires ni rien, pour le moment.Très léger mal de cœur avec les jeux qui demandent de tourner sur soit-même, mais ça ne m'empêche pas de jouer !C'est vraiment une belle expérience à découvrir.Si vous avez un PC qui tiens la route, foncez !

Ive had and used this now for nearly a week.I took a gamble spending the money on Oculus to experience vr.I can honestly say that it exceeded all my expectations.It's fairly comfortable considering I wear glasses, the image quality was much better than what alot of the reviews I read mentioned. And it was extremely easy to set up and navigate.Its very hard to know/see what he is like unless you actually experience it, all the YouTube videos don't give it justice.The reason for the 4 star review is down to it's getting slightly hot on your head after prolonged use, and the fact there is not a off switch which is abit annoying as you have to unplug it in order for it to stop running.

On sent que l'on est passé de l'époque kickstarter à l'époque commerciale.

La realidad virtual con Oculus Rift es realmente una maravilla en la sala. Después de utilizarlo, quedé maravillado con las experiencias y aplicaciones que se disfrutan como nunca antes.Además de lo increíble que es experimentar otras realidades a través del casco, el control de movimiento le agrega una dimensión extra al entretenimiento y vuelve las experiencias una maravilla.Eso si, requiere de un espacio considerable y, de preferencia, que permita mantener los dispositivos conectados en todo momento, para evitar la configuración y calibraciones iniciales, que toman mucho tiempo. Sin embargo, una vez hechos al gusto y adaptados a la sala, las experiencias VR solo se vuelven más sorprendentes.

Que dire sur cet technologie! Reçu dans les délai avec Amazon Prime, très bien emballé et protégé, j'ai du cependant acheter pas mal de câbles et adaptateurs afin de tout pouvoir brancher (mes écrans, le casque, etc...). En tout cas je suis ravis de mon achat! Je trouves les jeux légèrement cher, mais c'est si bien!Et si vous l'avez ou voulez l'acheter, renseignez vous sur le supersampling. C'est un option à connaitre pour plus de confort!Si je devait faire la différence entre le Vive (premier casque que j'ai testé, et sur lequel j'ai travaillé) et l'Oculus, je dirais que les deux sont à égalité, mais que l'Oculus a tout de même plus de point pour lui.Certes, il vous faudra trois capteurs pour avoir un roomscale potable sans perte. C'est là où Vive est mieux, c'est que ses deux capteurs suffisent.Mais l'Oculus étant moins lourd, il est largement plus confortable, plus facile à installer sur la tête, et le micro-casque intégré est franchement très très bon!Les manettes Oculus sont cent fois meilleurs à celles du Vive.En revanche, je trouve que le Vive a une meilleurs qualité au niveau de la dalle. C'est là que le supersampling entre en jeu.Et on peut jouer des jeux Steam avec Oculus, comme Audioshield (que je conseil vivement!)

Le casque est legé et ergonomique, un plus aurait été un masque plus confortable qui épouse bien le visage comme le htc vive. Les controleurs sont ok, je les préfère à ceux du htc vive. Le rendu VR est génial, immersion total et nouvelle expérience. à noter le roomscale est vraiment plus performant avec un 3eme capteurs, c'est un achat en plus qui peut être judicieux pour une meilleur immersion et quasi égaler le roomscale du vive.Malheureusement je porte mon test sur le rift d'un ami qui a des performances correct pour le faire tourner. Je ne peux pas utiliser le mien car mon ordinateur portable, bien qu'équipé d'une bonne carte graphique pour faire tourner l'oculus, ne reconnait pas le casque à cause d'Optimus une technologie nvidia implanté dans tout les pc portables équipé d'une carte graphique geforce terminant par m ou mx. Beaucoup de personnes sont confrontés à ce probleme depuis la sortie de l'oculus et toujours rien n'a été et ne sera fait pour régler celui ci, simple question de buisness pour acheter un nouveau pc.En plus le code promo de 50€ vendu avec le casque ne fonctionnait pas, le sav amazon ne m'a jamais répondu (pas la première fois)

Meine Oculus kam nach einer Woche an. Die Lieferung blieb irgendwo hängen.Alls sie endlich ankam nahm ich mir den Tag frei und probierte Sie sofort aus. Das Tutorial der Oculus ist gut gestaltet und macht enorm viel Spaß, da Oculus im Tutorial die Grafik richtig gut darstellt. Von den 6 Gratis Titeln (die automatisch aktiviert werden sobald man die Oculus verbindet) gefiel mir Robo Recall am besten. Ich empfehle allerdings den Shooter Onward zu kaufen da der mir bisher am besten gefiel!Kommen wir zu den Pro und Kontras:Pros:- Perfektes mitten drinnen Gefühl!- Touch Controller agieren wie eine echte Hand da sie Sensoren besitzen die die Handbewegung nachahmen ( auch wenn keine Knöpfe gedrückt werden) Neben bei sind sie sehr angenehm zu handhaben und meines Erachtens nach bequemer als die Vive Controller- Einfaches Setup- Alle VR Spiele sind Kompatibel mit der Oculus- 6 Gratis Spiele- Sehr bequeme VR Brille und an jede erdenkliche Kopfform anpassbarKontras:- ""Room Scaling steckt noch in den Kinderschuhen  1. Empfehlenswert ist ein 3 er Sensor den man sich allerdings extern nochmal im Preis für 60 € bestellen muss  2. Empfehlenswert ist es auch die 2 Sensoren im Raum zu verteilen- Das 5 Meter HDMI Kabel ist für ein Großes Room Scaling zu kurz. Es Empfiehlt sich ein Verlängerungskabel anzuschaffen.Trotz den Kontras ist es mit den beschriebenen Tipps möglich ein perfektes Roomscalling zu haben. Für den Anfang reicht es jedoch locker aus die Sensoren nebeneinander auf dem Schreibtisch abzustellen da die bisher veröffentlichten Titel eine möglichkeit aufweißen sich im Spiel zu drehen. Ich selbst hatte keine Probleme mehr mit dem Roomscaling nachdem ich die Sensoren ein wenig weiter auseinander stellte. Hierbei braucht man allerdings Platz.Nun noch zu den USB Ports:2.0 USB slots reichen in den meisten fällen aus wenn ihr die Oculus nicht all zu oft nutzt. Je nach Person kann man hier aber unterscheiden da es auch Leute gibt die meinen 2.0 reiche ihnen nicht. Hierbei empfiehlt sich einfach ausprobieren! Wenn es dann doch nicht passen sollte kann man sich bei Amazon eine USB 3.0 Karte kaufen die in jedes etwas modernere System eingebaut werden kann.

I am going to start off this review by saying that this is a great product and if you want it then you should get it when you have the chance. Okay so I’m gonna list a few issues that I have faced. I am not blaming the product I am listing a few things for you to take note of before you get the product.1. Make sure you have a large space cleared of furniture and anything that might obstruct your path.2. Make sure you connect both the monitor and the oculus onto the same graphics card. I have a GTX 1060 and a GT 730 with only 1 HDMI each. So I naturally connected the oculus to the GT 730 as that was not being used but then I realised that I lose performance when I do that. But if I connect my monitor to the GT 730, I lose performance in games that use my monitor so a simple fix is to get a “DisplayPort to HDMI wire” and use that instead to connect both things to the same monitor. This is something I didn’t know about and got to know after a bit of testing. So have everything prepared3. The Xbox controller and wireless adapter are not provided with this version of this product so make sure you get those seperately if you want to play games with an Xbox controller. You can also use a Micro-USB with the controller instead of the wireless adapter if you already have a controller (I already had 2)Overall I’m loving the experience and if I have to list my favourite game it would have to be “SuperHot VR” the feeling of dodging bullets matrix style is just way too cool to resist.

Quel régal ! Reçu dans les temps et pour moins de 400 euros. L'emballage et la finition de l'oculus sont excellentes. Seule moment déconcertant, l'absence de mode d'emploi au format papier. Il suffit de naviguer jusqu'au site Oculus et suivre le didacticiel. Et une fois cela accompli, bienvenue dans un nouveau monde. Fabuleux ! J'ai essayé le produit pendant 30 mn sans aucune nausée et mal de tête. Je dispose de lunettes et n'ai nullement été gêné par ces dernières. Les bémols sont les suivants : la présence de câbles mais cela reste raisonnable, le léger flou/style légère brume mais rien de rédhibitoire, l'existence d'une grille au final assez pratique car délimitant bien la zone de jeu.Sinon, c'est véritablement immersif. Certes, chacun parle des jeux mais attention à ne pas se limiter à ces seuls divertissements car la VR offre tellement davantage avec la visite d'appartements virtuels, de films dans lesquels on côtoie des animaux improbables, bref nous n'en sommes qu'au début. C'est fabuleux.

Ich empfinde sie als gleichwertig gut wie meine Sony Kopfhörer.Brille trägt sich sehr gut, Design gefällt mir besser wie bei der VIVE.VIVE fühlt sich dagegen wie Panzer an, ich kenn aber nur das Tragegefühl ohne AUDIO Deluxe Strap.Den eingebauten Bildschirm mit Linsen fühlt sich gut an meinen empfinden besser, aber es gibt unter meinen Kommilitonen nach den Test Vive vs Oculus gespaltene Meinung. Mir fällt nur negativ auf das bei heller Umgebung Dunkle Objekte nachziehen. Bei dunkler Umgebung god rays.Tracking sollte man 3 Sensoren benutzen, dann ist es gut zwar kommt es einfach nicht an eine VIVE heran aber es reicht sehr gut aus.Touch Controller find ich viel viel besser wie VIVE oder Windows VR-Lösungen. Es kommt leider von Rumble nicht an XBox oder Playstation Controller heran schade.Setup, Programm und Umgebung gibt es nichts zu bemängeln. Die Vive war für mich eine Höhle hatte dauernd Bluescreens bevor ich verstanden hatte das man die VIVE in USB 2.0 Port stecken muss und nicht in einen 3.1 oder 3.0Ich weiß nur nicht warum ich je was in Oculusstore kaufen sollte wen der Steam Store mehr Vorteile bringt.

Habe die Rift jetzt ein paar Wochen im Einsatz und bin begeistert. Zuvor hatte ich die PSVR welche mir auch Spaß gemacht hat, aber immer wieder für Frust gesorgt hat, weil das Tracking nicht wirklich gut funktionierte.Bei der Rift ist das Tracking sehr präzise und das Ganze mit nur 2 Sensoren. Habe einen vor mir und einen hinter mir aufgestellt und ich kann mich drehen wie ich will, das Tracking bleibt genau und wackelt kein bisschen. (obwohl empfohlen wird für 360° 3 Sensoren zu verwenden)Auch Software gibt es mittlerweile recht gute. Ich kann jedem nur Lone Echo plus Echo Arena empfehlen. Schon allein dafür hat sich die Rift gelohnt.Nur die Kabel könnten gerne etwas länger ausfallen, weil das Verlängern der Kabel relativ schwer fällt, da man Verbindgsprobleme bekommen kann. (Headset wird bei manchen Verlängerungen nicht mehr erkannt)Anonsten kann ich jedem der eine potente Grafikkarte besitzt nur empfehlen in die Virtuelle Welt einzutauchen und zu staunen.Für mich ist es ein Riesensprung in die richtige Richtung und ich bin sehr gespannt auf zukünftige Software.

Utilisée sur un PC, cet oculus est AMAZING! J'avais testé la 1ère version de l'Oculus, mais là c'est vraiment autre chose. Pour les jeux de simulation de vol, je conseil d'être assis, sinon ce sera la chute garantie. Attention pour certains jeux il faudra rajouter 2 autres capteurs car on ne peu pas se retourner complétement (360°). Sinon, les jeux livrés avec sont biens, surtout le jeu avec les robots. Il existes beaucoup de jeux gratuits sur la plateforme Steam VR, l'avantage de jouer avec un PC!Je recommande fortement! A comparer la Playstation VR est vraiment en dessous!

Mein Sohn hat sich die Rift gewünscht und kurz vor Weihnachten gab es ein Schnäppchen über Warehouse Deals und ich habe zugegriffen. So ganz zufrieden ist mein Sohn nicht teilweise gibt es Verzerrungen bei bestimmten Aktionen. Ich muss das nochmal abklären ob das so normal ist. Ansonsten finde ich es gut hier ein Warehouse Deal Teil gekauft zu haben, dass zumindest halbwegs in Ordnung ist. Da hatte ich in der Vergangenheit eher Pech.

Bin jetzt seit ca.2 Monaten Besitzer der Oculus Rift.Ich verfolge das Thema VR nun bereits seit mehreren Jahren, habe mich aber bisher geweigert ca. 1000 Euro (ehemaliger Preis) zu investieren,ohne zu wissen bzw. zu sehen, auf was ich mich da einlasse. Möglichkeiten zum Testen gab es nirgendwo. Mehr oder weniger zufällig stolperte ich in einem großen Elektromarkt dann doch über die Gelegenheit zum Testen.Ich hatte viel gelesen über "" Motion Sickness "" und andere Dinge die den Genuß trüben sollen,weshalb ich mir die Rift gleich mal für ne gute Stunde über den Kopf zog. Ergebnis: Sofort gekauft !!Ich war dermaßen angefixt das mir gar keine andere Möglichkeit blieb :)Zuhause angekommen und sofort den Karton aufgemacht . War alles sauber verpackt und die Rift nebst Touch Controller machten einen sehr wertigen Eindruck. Anschluss und Inbetriebnahme waren selbsterklärend da man durch eine sehr gut gemachte ""Schritt für Schritt""-Anleitung geführt wird.Anschließend legte ich sofort los (mit den Bereits beigelegten Spielen). Man könnte Argumentieren das diese Games nicht mehr währen,als kurze Demos um die Möglichkeiten der Rift zu demonstrieren, aber alleine damit kann man sich schon wochenlang beschäftigen.Selbst meine Frau, die mir normalerweise am PC nicht mal über die Schulter schaut, war schwer beeindruckt von dieser Technik und Art der Unterhaltung,Warum ich keine 5 Sterne vergebe ? Nun, wo Licht ist ist auch Schatten :)Zunächst wäre da die Tatsache das ein sehr potenter Rechner benötigt wird um in den vollen Genuß zu kommen: Mindestens 3 USB 3.0 Anschlüsse und eine Grafikkarte Richtung GTX1060.Selbst der schnellste Rechner verhindert jedoch nicht das sichtbare ""Fliegengitter"" welches der relativ niedrigen Auflösung zuzuschreiben ist.Auch der Tragekomfort wäre aus meiner Sicht verbesserungswürdig. Hatt man die Rift mal eine Stunde ohne Unterbrechung auf, fängt es doch hier und da zu zwacken an .Ein weiteres Problem , wenn man es so nennen will : Man benötigt eine ziemlich große Spielfläche um alle Möglichkeiten dieser Technik auszureizen (bspw um Hinter Kisten in Deckung zu gehen. feindlichem Beschuss auszuweichen etc.)Fazit :Eine Unglaublich Atmosphärische Erfahrung die alle bisherigen Unterhaltungsmedien in den Schatten stellt und doch an Kleinigkeiten krankt, welche mit der nächsten Generation hoffentlich Verbessert werden.Abschließend möchte ich sagen das ich den Kauf definitiv NICHT bereut habe. Im Gegenteil : Für den aktuellen Preis von ca.450 Euro empfehle ich jedem die Oculus zumindest mal zu testen .  Kann jetzt schon sicher sagen .das ich bei der nächsten Generation. welche vermutlich 2019 erscheint, wieder zuschlagen werde .

although ive given this 4 stars i personally would recommend people keep the £400 in there pocket.VR is impressive and pretty much does what it says on the tin. Regardless of image quality and those many issues nay sayers jump to, it is a fun and immersive experience.RoboRecall is a good example. This is one of the best VR games available and is great fun. But line it up against the best PC games - it falls very short. Also check out the range and price of VR games. They are massively out of touch with regular games.BUT i got mine for Assetto corsa and there it is brilliant. The resolution is terrible but the depth adds so much to the game. Even the extra weight on your head, the sweat around the seal and slight discomfort actually make it feel more real (like wearing a helmet). I find driving in VR a far more enjoyable experience. It has flaws, but i feel on the driving sims its a winner.Ive been running AC and the free games on a 6600k (4.4k) and 1070 (2.05k) and im rarely seeing more than 70% usageIts also great Oculus have dropped the price to 399  to give us all a sensible option of getting into VR.. or not.

Venditore corretto e spedizione puntuale con amazon prime. Il Pacco e arrivato integro e il contenuto all'interno e perfetto.Arrivando dalla versione DK2 di Oculus devo dire che sono stati fatti passi da gigante sia come materiali usati ,sia come visore. nessun problema di installazione su Windows 10. Ritengo che il prodotto sia ottimo e molto coinvolgente.Mi ritengo molto soddisfatto ma consiglio vivamente un acquisto di prolunga per i cavi di interfaccia pc di almeno 4 metri per avere la massima libertà' di movimento.Ho provato alcuni giochi di Oculus e spero nella crescente crescita di questo prodotto. Per quanto riguarda il famoso effetto zanzariera presente nel Dk2 devo dire che e quasi impercettibile e il coinvolgimento e totale.Nessun senso di nausea percepito a differenza del precedente visore.Per chi come me usa anche simulatori di guida con postazione movimento dinamico posso dire che ho provato Assetto corsa su piattaforma steam e sono rimasto soddisfatto.Ci sono comunque margini di miglioramento sulla risoluzione ma giocare indossando Oculus ti fa veramente sentire all'interno dell'azione.

Bon il faut être clair cette note est basée sur le fait que j'ai retourné le produit après deux jours d'essais.Pourquoi? Je vais rester objectif.Je ne joue qu'à des jeux de simulation auto il faut le préciser en préambule.testé sur iracingPoints positifs:-facilité de mise en route du produit pour ce qui me concerne aucun souci. C'est même amusant.- Immersion. gros point fort du produit c'est assez unique et incroyable. On est dans la voiture sur le circuit !Aie Aie ouille.... points négatifs:- J'ai une 1060 dans mon pc et 16 GO de RAM je pense que c'est juste il faut taper sur une 1080 pour être certain de la stabilité des FPS pour la fluidité. Par contre la carte ne changera en rien la qualité de l'image sur le plan de sa netteté. (La VR Bloque à 1200X1060 par oeil.)- Grosse déception l'image trop floue et imprécise! De plus le produit focus très mal et selon ce que vous regardez il a du mal à donner une image nette. C'est le gros gros souci de ce produit et de la VR actuelle (ne pensez pas que HTC drive soit mieux...). C'est vraiment dommage! Tous les forums parlent de petits logiciels qui peuvent doubler l'affichage mais en fait rien ne fonctionne ne vous laisser pas berner.Ne vous fiez pas non plus comme moi aux videos sur youtube l'image enregistrée est celle de l'écran qui fonctionne en parallèle de la VR ce n'est pas DU TOUT ce que vous voyez en jouant!j’achèterai ces produits sans aucune hésitation lorsque de sérieux progrès seront faits car les sensations sont fantastiques mais pour le moment le rendu visuel est vraiment trop décevant.

Had an HTC Vive about a year ago, but decided to sell it. One year later, I started to miss the VR, so this time decided to stick with a cheaper headset and the Oculus was my choice due to the further discount during the Amazon Prime Day. I am very pleased with this choice - the visual quality is better and clearer than the Vive. The screen door effect is not so noticeable. I have the bundle with 2 sensors, so I placed them on two light stands on two separate corners of my room: 1 behind the monitor and  the other exactly the opposite, behind me, around 3m apart (my room is not very big). The room scale tracking and experience is flawless, same as the Vive for my play area. For the sensor, which is behind me, I bought a 3m USB 3.0 extension cable,however during the sensors setup, the tracking was poor for this sensor with the extension cable, so I switched it to USB 2.0 port instead of 3.0 and it worked without any issues. My motherboard Gigabyte z370p just does not like extension cables on the USB 3.0 ports. Didn't bother buying a separate USB 3.0 PCI Card, because the tracking was perfect and I did not find a point to do it. I am mostly playing Elite Dangerous, Onward, Skyrim VR.The reason I am giving 4 stars:- VERY, VERY fragile lens! First thing you have to do after purchasing the headset is to buy the HealingShield Watchface Protectors. Scratches appeared on my headset just after a week of moderate use, while being careful. Even the hair and the included micro fiber cloth make micro scratches. Note that trying to fit the headset with glasses can destroy the lens, which can't be replaced!- Too many USB Connectors- one for every sensor, one for the headset- My MSI GTX 1080 has only 1 HDMI port, which is used by the Oculus, so I had to buy a DisplayPort to HDMI cable in order to connect my monitor, which only has an HDMI input.

Das Zeitgefühl geht meines Erachtens sehr schnell vorbei.Es sollte auch darauf geachtet werden das nicht jeder mit VR klar kommen kann, daher rate ich vorher ein VR Erlebnis zu testen oder nachzufragen ob man es gegeben falls zurückschicken kann.Mir geht es so, wenn sich im Spiel mein Körper bewegt und ich mich nicht wird es mir übel.Meine Positive eindrücke:- Selbst mit 2 Sensoren ein gutes 360° Erlebnis (kann aber zu Aussetzern der Controller führen, da schnell die Infrarot Lampen überdeckt werden)- Sound der angebauten Kopfhörern meines Erachtens top- Erkennung der Bewegungen sind gut und schnell- Sensoren schauen optisch recht gut aus- VR-Brille schaltet sich bei nicht Benutzung ab bzw. beim abnehmen der VR-Brille- Tragekomfort finde ich recht gut, auch nach längere Zeit hatte ich keine Probleme- Sehr überrascht war ich als ich herausgefunden habe das die VR-Brille ein eingebautes Mikrofon hat.- Die Controller liegen sehr gut in der Hand und der Bogen um die Hand stört eigentlich so gut wie gar nicht- Verarbeitung der VR-Brille und Controller ist TopMeine Negativen eindrücke:- Im Zeitalter von Akkus finde ichs schon schwach, das immer noch normale Batterien verwendet werden. (Sind aber zum glück dabei)- Meines Wissens war Oculus einer mit der ersten VR Brillen für den Alltag und Sie schaffen es nicht die Öffnung der Nase lichtdicht abzudichten (fällt bei spielen kaum auf, wenn man konzentriert ist)- Einrichten der Sensoren ist nicht das beste. Laut Bildern stehen die Sensoren gerade einmal 0,5m auseinander. Richtet man nun die Sensoren aus Beschwert sich die Software das der Abstand sei zu nah.Auch wenn man versucht die Sensoren schräg gegenüber aufzustellen (um ein besseres 360° Tracking zu ermöglichen), passt es auch nicht nur wenn man einfach auf weiter klickt und die Warnung ignoriert.- Das die Software immer im Hintergrund aktiv ist ohne Vorwarnung. Wenn man diese Manuell deaktiviert muss die Software neu installiert werden.- Auch ein nicht so guter Grund ist der Datenschutz wieso muss man meine Bewegungen abspeicher.(Wer dies aber nicht möchte sollte sich eher keine Oculus kaufen und eher auf die HTC greifen ob es da aber auch nicht so ist kann ich nicht beurteilen)Im Großen und Ganzen ist VR ein tolles Erlebnis was man sich mal ansehen sollte. Natürlich ist es nur Spielzeug oder Schwachsinn. (Geh ich aber davon aus wäre alles was Geld kostet und nicht zum leben notwendig wäre Schwachsinn)Es ist auch immer wieder schön zu sehen was andere davon halten, wenn Sie die VR-Brille das erste mal aufsetzen.______________________________________________Diese Rezensionen wurden von niemanden Bezahlt und bekam das Produkt nicht zur Verfügung gestellt.Hier werden meine Erfahrungen geschildert die ich erlebe und so erlebt habe.Es kann auch bei einigen anders Funktionieren

Certes, découvrir que la promo 450€ avait commencé avec un pack plus complet (manette xboxone et commandante) est un peu rageant, mais le Rift + touch vaut largement l'investissement tel quel. Acheté avec un nouveau PC au lieu de m'acheter un écran XXL 4K + machin, Je suis ravis de l'expérience.à noter qu'il est dommage de devoir passer par des app tiers (dispo sur le store oculus) pour pouvoir avoir un écran virtuel avec son bureau (et toute sa librairie de jeux du coup) mais que ça fonctionne quand même bien.

Zu erst dachte ich sehe ihr lauter Fliegengitter verpixelte Spiele aber überhaupt nichts davon ist zu sehen ein wenig der Fliegengitter aber das merk man überhaupt nicht wenn man zockt. Ich zu mein Teil bin mehr als zufrieden das muss man echt erlebt haben das ist ne neue Dimension von Spielen und macht fit xD.Um richtige 360 grade zu haben rate ich einen 3ten Sensor zu kaufen mit 2 gehts auch aber nicht so perfekt wie 3.Der aufbau war superleicht und dank den neuen Oculus Software schalten sich alles ab ,sobald man das Programm schließt damit werde die Sensoren und das Headset automatisch abgeschaltet. Das warten hat sich echt gelohnt alle Kinderkrankheiten vom Software bereich sind fast gelöst.

J'ai initialement reçu un produit défectueux, mais Amazon m'en a rapidement envoyé un nouveau qui lui fonctionne parfaitement.La configuration est un peu casse-pied, mais une fois que c'est en place il suffit de ne plus toucher aux capteurs et on peut directement jouer à chaque nouvelle session. Les deux capteurs sont d'ailleurs largement suffisant pour tous les jeux que j'ai pu tester, pas besoin d'un troisième.Certes ce n'est pas le top du top niveau résolution, mais tout de même quelle immersion, quelles sensations. Le résultat est incroyable. Ce pack contient plusieurs jeux offerts d'excellente qualité, notamment le très dynamique robo recall et le très mignon Lucky's tale. En plus de cela, la compatibilité avec SteamVR est parfaite, et permet d'accéder à d'autres très bons jeux gratuits comme ""The lab"" et ""Rec Room"". Ne pas oublier non plus l'excellent ""Echo arena"", gratuit dans l'Oculus store et qui donne des sensations incroyables de zero gravité sans motion sickness.

Bought the Oculus Rift from Amazon a couple of weeks ago.Tried several apps and Google Earth VR, this was very impressive.Set it up for my flight sim with FSinside, this was amazing just what I have been waiting for.Then it stopped working  with a headset fault the software informed me.On looking on the web I found that this is a recognised fault, followed the recommendations for recovery without any results.The spec of my pc is well within the required needed, is the problem my system or the Oculus rift ?To prove beyond doubt I rebuilt my O.S with a clean install of Windows 10  and the problem is still there.I pack the Rift up in its box and returned to Amazon.Very disappointing I miss it already, but I have better things to do that test a product for Oculus.I cannot buy another because of the uncertainty that the problem will not occur again.The one good thing that came out of my purchase was it proved beyond doubt to me,that Amazon provide a service that is second to none.Thank you Amazon.

Ich hatte schon Angst als ich mir die negativen reviews durchgelesen habe, aber bei mir lief alles einwandfrei.Das Produkt ist am nächsten Tag um 9 Uhr angekommen. Paket war wie beschrieben etwas beschädigt. Aber sonst, Alles einwandfrei. Die Oculus hat keine optischen beschädigungen, Setup lief wunderbar und nach 3 Tagen testphase kann ich auch überhaupt nicht meckern.Mein PC is zwar noch ein kleines bissien zu schwach, was den Prozessor angeht aber das war mir von anfang an bewusst.

Ich habe mir die Brille gekauft, da ich auf der Suche war nach einem besseren Sim Racing Erlebnis, und ich mir den Platz für 3 Monitore sparen wollte.VerarbeitungDie Verarbeitung ist gut, dass Material fühlt sich wertig an, jedoch hatte auch ich das Problem, dass irgend etwas hinter den Linsen zu sein scheint, es sah aus wie Kleber. Von diesem Problem haben auch bereits andere Käufer berichtet. Ich habe das Gefühl, dass diese sich von Session zu Session verändern, mal waren diese sehr stark vertreten, mal auch fast komplett verschwunden.Tragekomfort und EinstellbarkeitDie Brille ist äußerlich gut verarbeitet und sitzt auch ganz okay wenn man einmal die Bänder richtig eingestellt hat. Leider kann es dennoch passieren bei Kopfbewegungen, dass die Brille leicht rutscht wobei wir zum ersten Problem kommen. Die Linsen. Man kann diese in einem kleinen Bereich beliebig im Abstand einstellen um diese an die Position der Augen anzupassen. Ich finde jedoch, der größte Abstand ist noch zu wenig, ich hatte immer das Gefühl, dass ich noch 2 mm mehr benötige für die optimale Position. Ist diese nicht gewährleistet wird die Sicht sehr schnell unscharf. Dazu trägt auch das verrutschen der Brille bei. Ein weiteres Problem ist, dass wenn man beim Spielen ins Schwitzen gerät, die Linsen durch den Wärmeunterschied sehr schnell anlaufen, ähnlich wie eine Autoscheibe. Die Wärmeableitung ist sehr schlecht und die Brille wird auch sehr warm am Gesicht. Gegen das Anlaufen der Linsen hilf nur Spucke, aber wer will schon ständig auf die Linsen spucken?Bildqualität und PerformanceDie Bildqualität ist, wenn die Bille optimal vor den Augen sitzt ""akzeptabel"". Die Auflösung ist leider noch sehr gering und verwaschen. Man kann nur schlecht Text erkennen. Dazu trägt auch das Fliegengitter bei. Die Linsen zoomen dermaßen in das Bildschirmpanel, dass man die Abstände zwischen den Bildschirmpunkten/LED's erkennt. Die Brille produziert auch eine Art ""Light Rays"" / Lichtstrahlen, besonders stark bei Objekten, die nicht direkt im zentralen Sichtbereich sind. Im Vergleich zu meinen 3 Monitoren hat die Brille ein kleineres Sichtfeld und man kommt sich vor, als würde man ständig eine Art Tunnelblick haben.Die Performance ist gut, ich habe einen Intel I7 mit GTX1080, damit konnte ich meist in 90 fps spielen, sollte die fps abfallen hat die Rift ein ziemlich gutes System, um ""fake"" Bilder zu generieren. Es fällt wirklich nicht auf, wenn man unter die 90 fps fällt. Das Tracking der Sensoren ist direkt und sehr gut.Immersion / Erfahrung / ÜbelkeitWie schlecht auch das Bild sein mag, es ist einfach WoW, wenn man sich in einer virtuellen Welt umsieht oder das erste mal in einem Racing Game im Rennwagen sitzt. Es fühlt sich irgendwie echt und richtig an. Dieses Gefühl bekommt man auf keine andere Art und Weise. Es ist nicht einfach so, dass man ein Bildschirm vorm Gesicht hat, durch die Linsen wirkt es so, als wäre man in der 3D Welt, kein Vergleich zum 3D Kino oder irgend einem anderen 3D Erlebnis.Ein Gefühl bekommt man jedoch auch, wenn man sich in der 3D Umgebung bewegt ohne sich wirklich zu bewegen. Am Anfang kann dieses Gefühl einem den Magen umdrehen, bei mir verschwand dies zum Glück nach einiger Zeit, ich habe mich relativ schnell daran gewöhnt. Meine Freundin jedoch musste die Brille nach nicht mal 3 min abnehmen, da sie sich übergeben hätte.FazitIch habe die Brille zurück gesendet. Sie ist sicher ganz nett für die ganzen kurzweiligen ""fun"" Spiele, jedoch noch ungeeignet als dauerhafter Monitorersatz, besonders wenn man 3 davon hat. Die Wärmeentwicklung war wohl mein größtes Problem. Nach ca. 30min fing ich so stark zu schwitzen am Kopf an, dass der Schweiß bis weit in die Brille lief und die Linsen ständig beschlagen waren. Auch bekam ich von der Hitze schnell Kopfschmerzen. Wer nicht schwitzt und die verwaschene Fliegengittergrafik akzeptiern kann, der wird mit der Brille ein einzigartiges Erlebnis haben. Allen anderen rate ich dazu, auf die nächste oder sogar übernächste Generation zu warten.

Bonjour;Je lance aujourd'hui un coup de gueule contre la VR oculus rift, ça fait 2 fois que je commande ce pack oculus rift, le premier casquey'avais 2 défauts à savoir la manette ou le joystique gauche qui n'avait pas un bon cliqué et le casque avait un Défauts de vers où ont voyer 4 points blancs qui ne bougent pas donc j'ai faits un renvoie puis remboursement, ensuite j'ai recommandé un second pack, et là ses encore pires, j'ai 2 PC Gaming qui fait tourner la VR en très élevé, le drame arrive pour les 2 PC; je teste le casque sur l'application oculus et aussi Steam VR où je lance aussi vrchat et d'autre jeux vidéo en VR, et sur les 2 Pc à chaque fois je fais une session de 5 à 10 minutes et ensuite le casque (l'écran) se mais à clignoter tous les 1  seconde un peu comme des flashs et ça le fait presque a chaque fois, par chance je dis bien par chance j'ai réussi à faire 1h00 sans le flash d'écran puis ensuite ça recommence et aussi pour finir les capteurs qui se déconnectent aussi avec le son Windows qui me dit qu'un périphérique a été déconnecter; donc je refais encore une fois une demande de remboursement dès que je reçois mon remboursement je recommande encore une 3 iem fois le pack VR si celui-ci présent encore une fois ce genre de défaut sur les 2 précédentes commandes, je renvoie et je ne recommande plus de casque VR ou peut-être avec une version 10 du casque.ah oui et aussi Le son qui se coupe après quelques minutes sur les 2 casques reçus.Je ne sais pas si les casques oculus sont de mauvaise qualité de fabrication tout comme HTC VIVE déjà qu'on paye 450 € le casque sait quand même une grosse somme d'argent pour avoirs ce genre de défauts.En résumé :- je ne recommande pas cet achat de casque VR CV1 oculus rift s'y sait pour avoirs des problèmes comme ça.

Bei den VR Headsets gibt es ja nur zwei wirklich ernstzunehmende Systeme. Oculus Rift CV1 oder HTC Vive. Hier muss jeder für sich entscheiden, wo die eigenen Bedürfnisse besser erfüllt werden. Als Tester beider Systeme habe ich mich für die Rift entschieden. Der Schwerpunkt ist hier nicht die stehende, sondern die sitzende Anwendung. ABER auch bei der Rift kann man zwischenzeitlich stehende ""EXPERIENCES"" erleben. Das Vive ist  zudem einiges teurer und der Summer Sale von Oculus machten das System einfach attraktiver. So oder so möchte ich jedem ""UNWISSENDEN"" nahelegen einmal ein VR System zu testen. Das ist echt etwas Besonderes. Eintauchen in eine andere, eine virtuelle Welt! Eine ausschweifende Rezension hier zu schreiben macht wenig Sinn, zum einen gibt es viele Videos im Netz die, die Systeme vorstellen und zum anderen muss man wirklich selber herausfinden welches System einem besser passt. In jedem Fall ist was die Auflösung der Darstellung angeht noch Raum nach oben. Vermutlich in 2 oder 3 Jahren sind wir da wohl angekommen. Bis dahin sind Rift und Vive DIE REFERENZ!

Hallo VR-Gemeinde und InteressierteIch hatte die Möglichkeit alle aktuell ernst zu nehmenden VR-Lösungen zu testen:Oculus RiftHTC-VivePlaysation VRZur Playstation-VR möchte ich sagen, dass sie aus meiner Sicht den besten Tragekomfort bietet, da ich aber keine Playstation besitze und daran auch aktuell nichts ändern möchte blieb für mich nur die Wahl zwischen Oculus und HTC.Mal abgesehen vom Preisunterschied von aktuell ca. 400€ liegt für mich die Oculus aufgrund des besseren Tragekomforts und leichteren Setups vorne. Für die HTC müssen die 2 Sensoren an gegenüberliegenden Ecken im Raum befestigt und eigens mit Strom versorgt werden, bei der Oculus hingegen stehen die beiden Sensoren einfach links und rechts vom Monitor (ca. 1-2m Abstand) und versorgen sich über den USB Anschluss mit Strom. Dadurch ist zwar sicherlich das räumliche Tracking bei HTC zuverlässiger, allerdings konnte ich bisher bei keinem getesteten Spiel einen echten Nachteil erkennen.Die Oculus hat bereits vormontierte durchaus vernünftige Kopfhörer, wohingegen bei HTC eigene verwendet werden können/müssen, was zusätzlichen Kabelsalat verursacht (der Kopfhörer kann direkt in eine Buchse an der Brille eingesteckt werden).Ein weiterer Unterschied sind die Controller, bei der Oculus Variante können Daumen und Zeigefinger in der VR-Umgebung einzeln simuliert werden, sprich wenn man den Daumen vom Controller abhebt passiert dies auch in der VR-Welt, gleiches gilt für den Zeigefinger, womit es möglich ist in manchen Spielen durch Zeigen bestimmte Objekte auszuwählen. Außerdem lässt sich eine Faust ballen wenn alle Finger den Controller umschließen. Insgesamt fallen die Controller dadurch deutlich präziser aus.Was die Grafik betrifft, so konnte ich hier für mich nicht wirklich große Unterschiede erkennen, aus meiner Sicht sind alle Brillen da gleich gut. Gitter kann man allen Modellen erkennen.Bei meinem PC hatte ich das Problem, dass mir die Software (Steam VR) und einzelne Spiele immer wieder mal abgestürzt sind, was mir bei der Oculus nie passiert ist. Übrigens: Die Oculus funktioniert auch mit Steam-VR und viele Steam-VR Spiele sind auch mit der Oculus kompatibel, bei Kauf aber immer auf die Kompatibilitätsliste achten!!!Nachdem der Preis für die Oculus so stark gefallen ist, konnte ich nicht widerstehen und hab zugegriffen!Ein X-Box Controller liegt diesem Bundle NICHT bei, allerdings können alle Spiele auch mit den Touch Controllern gespielt werden.

The oculus is great for what it is, it does most of what you would expect it to do. But the entire set feels like it's still in very early access.Before thinking about buying this, research something called the 'Screen Door Effect' (SDE). The SDE is a HUGE disadvantage to headset and constantly allows you to see the pixels separation and causes the games to look very fuzzy and blurry. Even when fully adjusted to your specifications, the text in game and anything that is witching 1 metre of your player becomes almost double and is hard to see. An example of this is in the game Onward, you often have to check the chamber of your gun to see if you're okay on ammo, but it's hard to tell if what you see is a bullet or something else.One other thing is the downloading of games. For some of the free games that come with this product such as Robo Recall refuses to download. As an attempt to redeem the bug, I asked for help to oculus support. It has been 4 days and still no response.Overall - The screen quality is poor, the customer service is slow, the immersion is great, and the setup is very easy.

The Oculus Rift is an experience everyone must try out! I first got into mobile VR which was great but just an introduction to the VR world, so I saved my hard earned money up to buy this and I will never regret it.NOTE BEFORE BUYING:Make sure you have TWO HDMI ports (one for the rift headset and one for the monitor/tv). I, and many other people, had to buy a HDMI adapter since most graphics cards these days only have one HDMI port. I recommend buying a Display Port-to-HDMI adapter for the easiest solution and best results. Hope this helps people out.10/10

Als ich dann auf den höchsten Berg stand und kurze Zeit später tief im Ozean, als ein gigantischer Waal an mir vorbei geschwommen ist. Und als ich im Weltraum schwebte, den Blick zur Erde...

Ich habe mir bei einem Freund seine PS4VR angeschaut und das Erlebnis ist mit seither nicht mehr aus dem Kopf gegangen. Da ich mir gerade ein neues System gegönnt habe (Ryzen 1700, 1080 TI) habe ich mir das Bundle in der Sommeraktion geholt. Konsole mag ich nicht so und wäre mit einem Gesamtpreis von ca.900 Eur wenn man keine PS4 hat deutlich teurer gewesen. Mit Brille, 2 Touch Controllern und 2 Sensoren + alle Anschlusskabel hat man die komplette Ausstattung. Mein alter Kabel-Xbox Controller mit Kabel wird auch erkannt und leistet gute Dienste bei Spielen die diese Art von Controllern benötigen. Einrichtung Hard + Software problemlos (Achtung es sind 3 USB 3.0 Anschlüsse empfohlen die hat man oder man braucht einen Hub,  1 HDMI Anschluss wird auch benötigt). Es waren 6 Spiele als Download Der erste Eindruck ist überwältigend. Man ist wirklich drin und kann interagieren. Qualität der Grafik ist besser wie bei der PSVR wobei die PS4VR Grafik absolut ausreichend ist. Da ich in die Brille in meinem Büro betreibe habe ich zu wenig Platz und kann nur Spiele im sitzen oder stehen ohne Bewegung spielen. Mehr Platz ist besser. Man hat die Möglichkeit auch im Steam Store einzukaufen und die Software unter Oculus laufen zu lassen.  Ich kann das Ding bedenkenlos empfehlen wenn der Spielenachschub gewährleistet ist.

Probably about as good as it gets right now, for the price paid.I'm running this just fine with a GTX 970 4GB graphics card, an AMD 8-core CPU running at 4GHz, and 16GB of system RAM.I see warning messages telling me my CPU is not good enough, but I think this is a false report. I'd suggest googling your PC specs to see if they're compatible, rather than using the official compatibility checker, which seems to be using unsophisticated methods. Bare in mind that some games require a higher spec than others. My GTX 970 is about the minimum.Whilst the resolution is not so high, and the optical lenses aren't amazing, the immersive 3D effect more than compensates. It really is like stepping into another world with so much to explore.Highly recommended, although you might want to wait and see what the next generation of hardware is like at some point in 2018.Some negatives:The headset cable can be a nuisance at times.Could be more comfortable to wearController setup is not always consistent in different games and software, really needs standards to be enforced

Verwende die Rift ausschließlich zum Simracen (AC, PC2, DR, RR) und kann mir ein Leben ohne nicht mehr vorstellen ;-) Ist einfach nur genial. Auch wenn der Spruch vielleicht schon etwas abgedroschen ist, aber in diesem Fall trifft""Mittendrin, statt nur dabei"" wirklich voll zu. Die Auflösung mag noch nicht perfekt sein, was sich vor allem bei weiter entfernten Objekten bemerkbar macht. Aber das Erlebnis und die Atmosphäre machen das mehr als weg. Man fährt auch viel besser und schneller, weil man einfach schneller reagiert. Es ist wirklich so, also ob man wirklich im Auto sitzt. Meine Rundenzeiten sind schneller und konstanter geworden.Das einzige was es zu beachten gibt, sind die Hardwareanforderungen: Für ein flimmerfreies Erlebnis braucht man 90fps in einer Auflösung von 2160x1200. Dafür brauch man potente Hardware. Ich musst aufrüsten. Habe jetzt einen 6700k@4,5GHz + eine GTX 1080. Damit läuft alles perfekt.Und zur Motion Sickness sei gesagt: Langsam beginnen! Macht nicht den gleichen Fehler ich und startet gleich als erstes Spiel Dirt Rally. Euer Magen wird es euch danken...

Great product for a fantastic price. I've waited for affordable VR all my life ever since I saw a prototype system in the USA in the early 90s. Now it's here and having gone mainstream it's only going to get better and better. Worth the price for Google Earth alone. If you only know Google Earth from a 2D PC screen you will be blown away.

Die Oculus Rift wurde zum Zwecke des Sim-Racings erworben. Das nur kurz zum  Grund des Erwerbs.Leider hat das Setup länger gedauert, als die Freude an der VR-Brille.Die Oculus ist aus der ersten Generation und somit von der Grafikauflösung, für modernere Titel, nicht mehr Zeitgemäß.Das Gefühl, in die virtuelle Welt zu schlüpfen klappt aber wunderbar. Man hat wirklich das Gefühl, im Sportwagen zu sitzen (auf Sim Racing bezogen)Da aber die Auflösung der Brille viel zu gering ist, lassen sich die meisten Texte und Anzeigen nicht ablesen.Fazit:+  Im Grunde ok, Technik arbeitet solide. Hard- und Software werden von Windows 10 1803 ohne Probleme erkannt.+  Setup der Oculus detailliert beschrieben.~ Treiber mit 5,6 Gb muss vorher herruntergeladen werden. Installiert beträgt das ganze etwa 10 Gb-  Auflösung der VR-Brille nicht mehr zeitgemäß.

Ancien possesseur du DK2 (prototype de ce casque), déjà que les sensations étaient présentes avec l'ancienne version, avec celle ci c'est encore mieux. Le fait de voir ses mains dans l'univers virtuel rajoute énormément à la sensation de présence. Les jeux et expériences proposés sont correctement étudiés pour ne pas donner la nausée, et les jeux de shoot, qu'il soient basés sur des armes à feu, des arcs ou de simples projectiles sont jouissifs ! Le casque est plus léger, moins ""enfermant"", et le fait d'avoir les écouteurs intégrés fait que le son suit bien les mouvements de la tête. Avec le roomscale, le fait de pouvoir correctement se déplacer est aussi un énorme plus. Le roomscale permet également, grâce aux barrières virtuelles qu'on voit dans le casque quand on s'approche des limites fixées, d'être conscient de sa position dans la pièce réelle. La résolution est meilleure, mais la technologie gagnera quand même à évoluer sur ce point pour la suite... Les menus VR sont bien pensés, et on peut aisément passer d'une activité à l'autre sans quitter son casque. Avec l'appli ""Bigscreen"", on peut même utiliser son PC dans un salon virtuel avec un écran géant dont on peut régler la taille et la position à volonté ;)Les moins, par rapport au DK2 : Une partie située en haut du casque a tendance à chauffer, et sur les sessions un peu longues on le sent sur le front, je trouve ça assez désagréable. Les lentilles ont une forme curieuse, qui provoque plus de déformations et reflets que l'ancienne lentille. Il me semble que le champ de vision est légèrement plus restreint également.Quand j'ai reçu le mien, impossible de le faire fonctionner, tous les branchements étaient reconnus sauf l'HDMI. J'ai pu régler le problème en me branchant sur le DVI de ma carte graphique via un adaptateur HDMI>DVI.Dans l'ensemble, je ne regrette absolument pas cet achat, j'espère que la VR se démocratisera, car il y a un potentiel énorme dans plein de domaines (tourisme, éducation, médecine, art, etc...). Le produit sera parfait le jour où les résolutions des petits écrans auront explosé, et qu'on aura des casques VR devenus de simples lunettes ne comportant aucun fil !

Die Oculus Rift mit dem Touch Controller Bundle ist ein super Einstieg in die VR Welt.Die Verarbeitung und Qualität der Brille ist bei der HTC Vive deutlich besser, auch ist bei der Vive mehr Flexibilität gegeben, da die Kabel nicht direkt am PC eingesteckt werden müssen.Allerdings sind die Controller der Vive nicht nur optisch ein graus, sondern auch von der Funktion.Das perfekte Bundle wäre die Vive Brille und die Rift Controller, mal sehen was die Zukunft bringt.Ich finde die Rift ist sehr ""schwammig"" im Bild, mag am Blur liegen, doch selbst mit deaktiviertem Blureffekt, kein AA und 2.5x Sampling (dank 2x 1080Ti) gefällt mir das Bild nicht. Bei Spielen ist das Bild hingegen ""OK"".

Ich habe das Gerät gekauft nicht nur den Hype um VR zu sättigen sondern auch ernsthaft im Simulation Welt einzusetzten.Vor allem Interessierte ich mich für den Einsatz vom VR im Elite Dangerous, Microsoft Fligtsimulator X, X-Plane und DCS.Ich habe jedoch festgestellt das der Oculus Rift ist gut geignet für die Visuelle Darstellung aber die es lag meistens an den Spielen das gewisse Features vom Rift nicht ausgenutzt wurde.Pro:- Günstige Preis und VR in Perfektion- Gute Verarbeitung- Klasse und Intuitive touch controller und besser als erwartet- Klasse Software Paket- FligtSim X und Xplane11 funktioneren über zusatz Software aber es liegt nicht an Oculus Hersteller- Browser support excellent- Spiele Auswahll - RiesigCon:- Auflösung ist gerade ausreichend für Zukunftige Spiele.- Nausea - Bei simulationen wie Elite Dangerous, DCS wo ""Dogfight"" ein rolle Spielt ist es extrem anfällig. Ich hatte das gefühl das beim HTC das ich wenig anfällig war.- Für mich Persönlich nicht länger als 2 Std. Spielbar -Ich will das Produkt bei behalten, jedoch VR Thema befindet sich zwar nicht mehr in den Kinderschuhen aber die Hersteller und Developer vom Software müssen viele Mankos abdecken vor allem die Steuerung vom Keyboard Mouse auf alternative Kontroller umzulegen.Kaufempfehlung für Gaming Fans.

Ordered during the Summer of Rift sale for £399 and would not regret paying more for this.  I have only had a chance to use VR a couple of time, firstly using DK1 at the Red Bull air show and it was great but a little low res and the screen door effect took you out of the immersion.  Secondly at a Play expo before the touch controllers were released so again not so immersive.I was holding off to see what Microsoft had planned for VR with the Xbox One X but was frustrated when they did not announce anything a E3 so when the Rift dropped to £399 I jumped in.....and don't regret a thing :-)The product is really well packaged and when you open you know you are dealing with premium technology that has had a lot of care in the design.  Setup was a breeze and I was up and running on a very short amount of time.I have only had a chance to play a few games and apps but I am blown away, the sense of immersion is unbelievable, I nearly fell over on the vertigo scene in Face Your Fears :-).  Superhot VR is a must and I spent a good hour or so in game becoming an assassin of all things red.If you are unsure and think you will wait until the next generation of VR you are missing out on some great experiences and I have only touched the very tip of what this can do.  Cant wait to do some driving and flight sims.

The Oculus Rift is pretty decent for what it is, although there are quite a few minor issues that deterred me from keeping it, mainly being the fact cost to quality ratio. Don't get me wrong, the external quality of the hardware itself is some of the best I've seen in a consumer product, it feels premium from the second you get it out of the box, the problem lies in the actual experience, as a first gen version of the consumer release of course the experience isn't going to be 100% there, but it just doesn't feel worth it.

En tant que noob/débutant de la VR je me tâte a l'oculus rift.Premier problème j'ai qu'un port hdmi,vga et dvi. je n'avais qu'un câble hdmi et vga. (le port vga est dysfonctionnel.) donc après de vaine tentative je rachète un câble DVI->hdmi,... ma télé n'a pas de port DVI. Vous suivez ? Car oui l'oculus rift a évidement besoin de 3 port usb 3.0 ainsi qu'un port hdmi. Prévoyez donc tout a l'avance.Deuxième, Steam VR et Oculus ce confronte souvent et font planté les aplication en cours. Prévoyez un de ces fameux PC de gamer a 3 000€.Troisième, il faut un entrainement type nsa pour ne pas vomir face a certaine aplication/jeu.

Mal ganz ehrlich, die Sache ist schon weiter wie ich vermutet habe...Macht riesen Spaß, da kommen einem gewöhnliche Spiele am Monitor richtig Oldscool vor!Die Joypads sind wirklich klasse.Wo viel Licht ist, gibt es auch leider Schatten und zwar:1: Es gibt sehr störende Lichtspiegelungen, die besonders bei dunkeln Hintergründen mit heller Schrift (aber auch während des spielen) auffallen...2: Zudem je nach Spiel, kommt man nicht drum rum sich zu bewegen und wenn man anfängt zu transpirieren, beschlagen die Linsen sehr schnell und unter der VR Brille ist ein übler Hitzestau.3: Auch finde ich, das die Linsen zu nahe an meine Augenbrauen sitzen, was immer wieder zu Linsenverschmutzungen führt!4: Das Tracking mit zwei Sensoren funktioniert nicht schlecht, aber man hat ab und zu Sichtkontakt lags bei 180°, das man mit einem dritten Sensor beheben könnte.5: Alle Kabel sind zu kurz bemessen und man braucht mehrere Verlängerungen (USB 3 und HDMI).Achtung, die Oculus Rift ist wählerisch, unbedingt schlau machen was kompatibel ist, auch bei USB 3 PCI X Karten!Man sollte auch bedenken, das man richtig Platz benötigt, um Bewegungsfreiheit zu haben!Zudem habe ich nach langen Spiele Sessions Augenschmerzen bekommen und konnte in der realen Welt einige Zeit nicht mehr gut was mit den Augen an fixieren, ich denke, es liegt an der Verhältnismäßig geringen Auflösung!?----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Da man immer häufiger liest, das scheinbar, einige Bewertungen gefälscht sind, habe ich mir vorgenommen, mir die Mühe zu machenselbst Produkte zu bewerten, wenn mich die Muse küsst.

The Oculus rift and touch controllers work well, i have no complaints in that regard. But don't get fooled by videos from youtube that show playthroughs. The resolution inside the oculus is terrible, it barely matches to an old ps2 graphics. Even after you adjust it to best possible view angle, the only way to play those games and not get dizzy from the aliasing, crawling edges is to play at 2.0 supersample (which requires a gpu at least as powerfull as gtx1070 or gtx1080 -> the one that i play on)

Etant déja possesseur du Playstation VR depuis sa sortie en octobre dernier j'avais déja pas mal d'experience sur la VR et ce qu'elle peux proproser (jeux, vidéos, photos 360° ....). J'étais bluffé par celui-ci à sa sortie.Promotion oblige de ce pack (450 €), j'ai voulu me lancer dans ce qui semblait être vraiment en dessus de la VR smartphone et du PS VR.Eh bien je ne m'y suis pas trompé, j'ai re-découvert la VR comme si je n'y avait jamais goutté.La qualité graphique est réelle et le rendu en jeu est hallucinant ! (tourne sur GTX 1080 & i7 7700k)Le casque est ... noir ... juste noir. Mais par contre dès que vous ouvrez le bundle ça respire la qualité.ATTENTION : Il est nécessaire de posséder un port HDMI libre sur votre carte graphique ainsi que de minimum 3 ports USB 3.0 (casque + capteurs x2). Selon votre nombre de slots libres votre carte mère et la vitesse de ses bus il vous faudra investir dans une carte pci-e qui vient ajouter de sports usb sur un bus differents (vitesse plus rapide car moins de splits - occulus recommande la inateck dispo sur amazon pour 20/25€).J'ai aimé :+ Qualité graphique & immersion totale (selon votre pc faites des tests avant pour ne pas risquer de mauvaises surprises)+ Hauts-parleurs intégrés de qualités & très confortables+ Qualité du tracking des occulus touchCe qui peut gêner :- Piles non rechargeables fournies avec les touch (oui pas de batterie)- Installation des pilotes- Les capteurs doivent êtres écartes suffisamment (1m à l’extrême minimum donc ne rentre pas sur un bureau standard).En conclusion, la promotion apportée par oculus devrait permettre de propulser légèrement la VR car le frein premier à celle-ci est le prix du casque & du pc nécessaire pour profiter d'une expérience correcte.

Out of the box, the two sensor Oculus touch can be really amazing, fun and the coolest thing you've done on your computer since Quake II over dialup. I do believe that VR is the future and that it can only improve from here on out and all that said, when it comes to the Oculus at least, there are so many problems to solve.The first thing I realized was that two sensors was not enough. Turn around and it loses track of your hands. So, I got a third (and fourth) sensor. Turns out after much time setting up those new sensors, it only supports three despite claims to the contrary. Ok, whatever, so I set up just the third.Well, turns out this overloads your USB controller and your computer just can't handle that level of traffic. I've never heard of this ever happening before with any device until now.So they recommend a separate USB card to buy in order to ""fix"" the problem.  The card has enough of its own problems I won't get into here because that's a separate product.  Let's just say the sensors even overload that thing unless you split them between controllers, the new card, and your main USB slots. Ok Whatever...The next problem you encounter when playing more games is that wires are not good. You get tangled up in them quickly and it's hard to maneuver about in any optimal way without it becoming an issue. Also, the cables are too short! #%$@%$!! So you find out about these hooks you can stick to the ceiling to handle the wiring tangle issue and you buy HDMI and USB extension cables to fix the length problem.Nope. That won't work. The extensions need repeaters to work with the Oculus. UGH, I give up as I'm sure a lot of people already have. The constant USB disconnects despite two controllers and repeaters... That explains why it's so hard to find people in multiplayer games.I did buy the repeaters but if problems persist, this just isn't going to work out. Oculus Rift needs a lot of work. I may just have to return it all and wait until more advancements are made in the next 5 years.Update:Between game freezups that Oculus refuses to take responsibility for, general all around bugginess with everything, having to constantly pair and re-pair the touch controllers every single time I reboot (rebooting to fix stupid game freezups) is nearly the last straw. I'm about to return this stupid thing and get a Vive.Update 2:Oculus games crash with extreme regularity, usually freezing up in video and then exiting, Echo VR in particular which is a game by Oculus but many other games as well. I don't know what causes it but they continue to blame my GTX 1080 drivers as if uninstalling them again and reinstalling them again for the 4th time will somehow make some kind of difference. Their support is terrible.Update 3: Turns out the crashing issues were unrelated to the Rift, I upgraded my power supply to a 1200 watt and updated my chipset drivers. One of those two solutions fixed the whole problem and I haven't crashed since. I've had a lot of fun with the Oculus now and I'm using it all the time for so many fun games. VR is the future for sure and this is the first generation of a new world.

VORHER ging es noch - scheiß Firmware-Zwangsupdate von Facebook / Oculus...Dann noch die eher unausgereifte Software zur unausgereiften Hardware,...Wenn sich die Hardware mal verkeilt hat, dann hat nur noch mal ein halbstündiges ""Reparieren"" mit dem Installer geholfen.Auch kommt es vor, dass beim Beenden von Spielen Fehler auftreten oder die Programme einfach nicht richtig beendet werden und die Software dann einfach in einem halbgaren/nicht mehr funktionierenden Zustand zurück lässt.Auch ist es scheiße, dass die Oculus Dienste gleich nach dem Systemstart ebenfalls starten... Ich möchte das nur, dass dies läuft wenn ich die Rift verwenden will...Spionage durch Facebook über die Kamera-Sensoren lässt grüßen?Davon mal abgesehen ist das Erlebnis doch ganz gut - sofern es gerade funktioniert...Nicht überragend, aber gut. Die Grafik ist eher etwas matschig, aber die VR-Technik steckt ja noch etwas in den Kinderschuhen. Daher kann man das verschmerzen und als i.O. hinnehmen.EDIT:Oculus Rift hat enorme USB & Hardware-Probleme.Entweder geht es nicht und man muss solange rumspielen bis die scheiß Hardware läuft oder es läuft zwar und kommt ständig mit Neu-Erkennung der Rift-Sensoren.Das ständige ""Bling"" vom Neu-Erkennen des Sensors NERVT!

Outstanding product regarding the VR experience, just want to mention couple of thingsi)  The Oculus Rift headset uses an OLED panel for each eye, each having a resolution of 1080×1200. So display is not ultra sharp and there are some pixelations and Screen-Door Effects(SDE) but nothing game breaking.ii) You need to have a fairly good computer to enjoy the headset at fullest.At least a GTX 1070 is recommended (though not always sufficient) if you want to use supersampling to improve the graphics quality.iii)Third party programs like VorpX (to play non-VR games in VR) do not match the quality and immersion of natively VR games. So do not keep high expectations for non-VR games.If you love 3d in games and movies just buy it and you will be amazed.

Vorab:Ich gebe der Oculus Rift mit dem TouchBundle 3 von 5 Sternen da es zurzeit einfach noch zu viele Negative Dinge an der Oculus Rift gibt.Die Oculus Rift ist für viele Menschen eine Erweiterung in Sachen Gaming, leider trifft dies auf mich nicht zu, da ich Brillenträger bin (mit sehr hoher Dioptrien) ist es für mich sehr schwierig die Oculus Rift ohne Brille zu verwenden, des Weiteren habe ich durch das Tragen und benutzen der Rift Kopfschmerzen und Übelkeit bekommen.========Versand:Die Brille wurde sehr schnell geliefert, der Schutz des Produkts war durch einen sehr großen Karton gegeben.========Einrichtung:Das einrichten der Oculus erwies sich komplizierter als zunächst gedacht, neben anfänglicher Startschwierigkeiten mit dem installieren folgte dann gleich das nächste Problem: passende VR-Spiele finden, da es aber viele der VR-Spiele bei Steam gibt, konnte ein Freund mir ein paar Spiele teilen, um die Oculus Rift auf Herz und Nieren testen zu können.========Spielerlebnis:Das Spielen von den VR Titeln macht mit Sicherheit viel Spaß, wenn man sie ohne Kopfschmerzen benutzen kann. Daher kann ich zu dem Spielerlebnis nicht so viel sagen.Hinzu kommt das Spielen mit den beiden Touch Controllern, diese sind die Hände und erkennen jede Fingerbewegung, die Controller passen perfekt zu der Oculus Rift und dürfen auf gar keinen Fall fehlen.========Fazit:Die Oculus Rift ist meiner Meinung nach noch ausbaufähig, es wäre schön wenn man sie auch als Brillenträger ohne größere Probleme verwenden könnte, des Weiteren würde ich mir mehr VR-Spiele wünschen, aber das kommt bestimmt noch in Zukunft.

Da man sich sonst nichts gönnt, muss auch mal was außergewöhnliches her. Am Anfang ist es natürlich ein großer Wow Effekt, der zwar nicht viel nachlässt, aber drei Sterne gibt's von mir nach ein paar Monaten Nutzung aus folgenden Gründen.Es ist mühsam bei Nutzung jedes mal den Platz freizuräumen und die Sensoren zu platzieren. Wir haben leider keinen eigenen VR Raum.Die Auflösung war am Anfang ok, aber fühlt sich im Vergleich zu 4k (mit 8k bereits am Start) einfach etwas mager an. Auch die Verzögerung kann man sicher noch verbessern. Auch Software seitig kommt der Markt nur langsam in Schwung.Ums kurz zu machen... Die Abstände in denen wir die Rift nutzen, werden länger und länger. Der anfängliche Hype ist leider verflogen.

If you've got the PC to handle this, you really need to try the Rift + Touch.  Especially at the great price point of ~$400 right now.  I've had it for several days now and am really enjoying the experience.  I haven't tried the Vive, so will not try to compare there.  However, I did try the PS VR for about a week.  Hate to say it, but that experience was awful.  I ended up taking the PS VR back to Best Buy.  Long story, short.  Check out the PC requirements - they're stiff.  If you've got the PC and have the slightest interest in VR, you need to try this out.Here's a long, long review of things I've tried and/or done right (and wrong!) with the Rift...Should have downloaded the Oculus software when I ordered the Rift.  Once I got my Rift, I figured out that I'd have to download the software.  It was tougher than it should have been to pick the initial drive to download to.  I've got a solid state C: drive and really didn't want to install there - but it was inordinately difficult to switch.  Finally gave up and just took the plunge.  If I'd worked on it ahead of time, I wouldn't have felt as rushed.There's an initial training program that pops up.  Don't start sharing your Rift with anyone else until you've had the chance to go through training!  I started sharing and didn't get it back until the next day...This bundle came with 2 sensors.  Don't set them up as you think they should be setup.  One would think that the lines on top of the sensor should point to the general middle of where you will sit/stand.  that didn't work for me at first at all.  My sensors are to my 2 and 10 oclock - but the lines aren't pointing at me.  They're pointing somewhere behind me.  If you get them close enough to where they need to be, the install will show you how to twist things around - but it definitely seems odd setting them up originally.  I can sit and stand and pretty much anything in between and both head and hands are tracked very well.Setup with the Touch sensors works really well.  Once setup, you can 'see' where they are with your rift on - which helps immensely.  There's no fumbling around trying to figure out where they're at or putting them in my lap or having someone hand them off to me...  There's also a guardian mode.  On initial setup, you use the touch sensors with sound/vibration to delineate your play area without your Rift on.  Then when you put the Rift on, you'll see a grid around you if you get too close to your boundaries.  it sounds more complicated than it really is - I've got an oddly shaped area with other desks and bookshelves and it works just fine.This bundle comes with several games.  My favorite so far is Dead and Buried.  You can see your ghostly hands in front of you and there are several mini-games.  Reloading is a neat flip of the hands and the sensors pick things up just fine.  Some of the minigames also take advantage of you ducking or leaning.  No discomfort here at all.Steam VR was installed so that I could try out Google Earth VR.  Important note!  Make sure you go through the Steam VR setup process!!!  I was standing on my tippy-toes with my chin at ground level until I figured that out.  This one definitely made me queasy until I got it setup properly.  Google Earth VR is just amazing.  I'd like some way to search in VR as you do in Google Earth.  It can be tough finding your way around the world flying like Superman...Then the one I was really wanting to try...  Elite Dangerous.  I've had Elite for quite some time now, but it is completely different in the Rift.  Things to note here: if you already have Elite installed, you have to go into graphics settings and select the headset from the 3d options.  Volume was also inconsistent here - not sure if this is something to do with my drivers, but I was constantly fiddling with volume for some reason.  At points way too loud, at others way too quiet.  You'll also need to get your finger ready on the F12 key - or whatever you have the recentering key bound to.  This took me several webcrawls to figure out the problem.  Initial setup had me completely turned around in my chair in order to see the menu.  Get close to where you'll sit, then hit your recenter key.  You may have to fiddle with that a little bit to get your head properly seated in your in-game body.  I've got a HOTAS setup with the Saitek x52 and thought I would be fine...  Unfortunately, I still have a few keys keyed to keyboard inputs - and that's just not an option.  I'll have to do some more customizing before I can fully fly around in Elite.I'd advise starting off in training mode because it really is that different.  I've got a few bounties on my head..  Some space stations just have no sense of humor!  But the sense of immersion is just amazing in Elite.  Can't quite make out those labels on your screen displays?  Just lean a little closer.  Look over your shoulder to track that pirate visually.  Eyes hurting from flying too close to that sun while doing a fuel scoop - just look around your cockpit to take a break!  Want to walk around your cockpit?  Go for it!  Okay - that one breaks the immersion a good bit as your body is left behind.  But it would be interesting to do in one of the bigger ships just to see what happens...

To be clear: You will not regret buying into VR, and this is a great experience.I don't regret my purchase. By my 3 star rating I literally mean that it is okay.But if I had another £300 lying around that I didn't feel strongly about (but alas! I don't), I'd have gone for the HTC Vive. The difference isn't earth-shattering, and unless you have tried both headsets you wouldn't really find fault with either.However, if you are like me, with limited time each day with which to explore virtual reality, the price of paying £300 extra would probably have been worth it, for saving a few minutes each time you get it running, for saving having to take the headset on and off, and for more 'professional' options for productivity that I am particularly keen on myself (VR keyboards would be amazing, only being developed on the Vive atm).PROS (over the Vive:):-Headset is lighter-Touch controllers are more immersive-Access to the Oculus store (you can access this from the Vive too, through the ReVive tool, but it isn't reliable).CONS:-To really get what you are paying for, you will need a third sensor.-If you want to share the Rift between people of different heights, or you yourself are shorter/taller than average, you will need to use SteamVR in order to set the floor location accurately (it is pretty immersion-breaking to fall through the floor when you crawl or lie down).-The Oculus doesn't work so well with games on Steam.-Shorter sensor range, and seemingly slightly worse tracking (despite a similar setup-Purchases on the Oculus store will possibly not be available for you if you decide to purchase a non-Oculus product later down the line. Given how new a field VR is, and how many new players are still yet to join in,Edit: A few months later, I don't think 3 stars is harsh.Extension cables are a nightmare to use, because it is a bit and a third sensorof a lottery as to whether they work or not (even for Amazon basic 3m USB 3.0 extension cables). This is to be expected; but Oculus's response to it isn't. The error messages are about as informative as a horoscope, and setup completely froze my computer if I had a bad cable in, for minutes at a time, allowing only second-long intervals with which to move the mouse and exit the setup.With GPU prices as insane as they are now, the £200/300 bump to get a Vive is more justifiable if you want a system right now.

Don't hesitate, just get it. At the price point of $400 or below for the Rift headset, 2 controllers, 2 sensors, plus the free games, it's totally worth it. I was blown away by the very first training app\game (Oculus First Contact). You can see this online but trust me, it is not the same experience until you're actually IN the room and walking around, moving and doing things in it.I have the 2 sensors slightly above me and pointing slightly down and behind and to my sides, seems to be the best tracking. I don't yet need a 3rd sensor because 2 is really good. I will some day, or if you want it to be perfect, then splurge for the 3rd sensor. But you can try it out first and see before deciding if you need it.Be sure and install Steam VR with this, there are lots more games that work with both the Vive and Rift in Steam that you'll miss out on if you don't.When you first get it, go into General Settings and enable 3rd party apps and disable that warning message so it doesn't always pop up when you start it ;).I wish I could take screenshots or videos to show you what it's like, but you really have to experience it. Seeing it 2D on a computer monitor is NOT the same thing as actually being inside the virtual world.Another app you may want to buy separately is Virtual Desktop. This lets you use your computer while wearing the headset. If you don't get this, you have to take it off to interact with your desktop and that's a pain.All in all, I would recommend this to anyone that has a computer and graphics card powerful enough to run it well.

Oculus hat meinen PC so hart bekämpft dass es mir bald das Netzteil zerlegt hätte. Leider kein Scherz.Das größte Problem war mit den Sensoren. Entweder wurden sie gar nicht erkannt, oder nur schwach - also nutzlos.Bei jedem Start musste ich die Treiber neu installieren da die Sensore sonst nicht erkannt wurden, und bei jedem start der Oculus-Software wurde der Desktop verzerrt, alle Symbole darauf verschoben und/oder versteckt.Klingt nervig? War es auch.Kommt noch dazu dass sobald ich die Brille aufsetzte mir die Augen weh brannten.Die Auflösung ist so niedrig dass alles verschwommen wirkt. Mancher Text war nur schwer oder gar nicht lesbar. Und egal wie ich die Brille einstellte und verschob. Das Ergebnis blieb dasselbe.Mein Fazit also: Geht leider wieder retour. Wirklich schade.

DO NOT BUY! Just like all the other negative reviews, if you have any problem with your Oculus Rift ""Oculus Support/Customs service"" will not help you. My son saved up his birthday and Xmas money for 2 years to buy a VR, and when he got his VR in he loved it, played it all the time, and all of a sudden on day the screen would go black when you were playing then come back and go black again everytime you moved around. So we put in an email to Customer Support, tried all troubleshooting steps, and when they realized it needed to be sent in they asked for a invoice of the purchase, which I sent them, they immediately sent back an email saying we cant help you because you didnt buy the product directly through us. So 500 of my sons hard earned money down the drain. Try telling an 11 year sorry man its broke and they wont fix it so if you want to play you gotta spend another 500 dollars.

After March 7, 2018 the unit stopped working, which was later reported to be Software Certificate error made by Oculus causing ALL units around the world to stop working. They issued a patch about a day later with no detailed information. Since that day, the unit has not worked. Over 10 hours wasted trying to get it to work and I am a software engineer since 1981. The headset receives audio and the log files show many Oculus error messages NONE of which are covered in their support forums or online Knowledge base. It is 2018, Oculus GET YOUR ACT together! i am sending my unit back for a full refund and will never buy from this company again!

I'm personally at a point in life where I don't know if I will survive long enough to see a device like this really evolve into something that will transform the way we game work and experience media. So at the sale price of 400 dollars I'm happy to say that Rift delivers with some considerations. Touch controllers are amazing when first experienced.  Games written specifically with VR in mind and especially those Occulus exclusives (Robo Recall, Mages Tale etc.) really show the potential of the technology.  That is when you aren't untangling cables, adjusting sensors, rebooting software etc.  Consider your level of trouble shooting knowledge, consider your available space if you are wanting to play room scale experiences, consider your tolerance  for a small software library of meaningful titles vs a avalanche of shovel ware and tech demos.  There are big considerations with comfort that aren't stressed enough.  Do you dig sweat? You better because the headsets foam cushion will get incredibly wet and gross.  Not to mention the lens fogging up from your breath while breathing through your nose.  What I am trying to say is that the Rift can be a amazing and also frustrating piece of tech.  When it""s clicking on all cylinders it will transport you to another world.  When it's losing tracking or you have tripped on a cable or your getting motion sick then you will quickly put it down for more traditional forms of entertainment.  This is prime example of early adopter tech and should be researched and considered as such before you purchase.

This came with a 16 ft active extension cable. Before I purchased, I asked if it would come with the additional extension cable and I received a lot of mixed responses. However, as of December 22nd, 2017, it DID arrive with the extension cable. The sensor works great, as expected, and I must say that it is a MUST for anyone wishing to get full immersion for 360-degree games.IF you do not happen to get this extension cable with your package, or it is simply not long enough for you, then I strongly recommend using this cable (Plugable 10 Meter (32 Foot) USB 2.0 Active Extension Cable Type A Male to A Female) as I did and it works great with the Rift.

Why I bought it-----------------------I never really thought about buying a VR headset.I did read about it a while ago since I love technology and I was curious.But last time i checked, it was too expensive and the reviews around the net stated that there was not enough content,Based on those 2 facts, the reviews didn't really recommend it as something worth purchasing. So I didn't.Then, one day, i was checking the current prices of those headsets and i noticed that the Oculus Rift was on sale for just 400$.*Edit: on black Friday it was as low as 350$I then started looking for updated reviews and was reading some great stuff about Rift's new touch controllers.I did not think twice, I knew that 400$ is a price i am ready to pay to try some new and cool technology.Build quality------------------I must say that the build quality of this product is really outstanding.It feels very stable, beautiful, it feels nice in your hands and on your head.You can wear it for quite a long time without getting uncomfortable.You'll notice that luxury feeling from the moment you see the box and the unboxing process.One big problem is when you start sweating. The foams that are sitting on your face are soaking water instantly and becoming really disgusting. Making it difficult playing with others.*Edit: after a few times that I've been using the headset, I suddenly noticed dirt stuck inside the right screen, it was clearly stuck inside and I sent a video to their support and they agreed with me.It was very noticeable as a big black mark when wearing the headset.The screens are sealed so I couldn't open in order to clean it. It probably happened during manufacturing.I tried contacting them and sent them the information that they have requested, but then they replied and requested even moreinformation with some serial number that should be located on the headset strap, which I didn't find.I did not want to spend even more time understanding what they want from me, so I left it as it is.Later the dirt has moved again to the sides so at least it does not interrupt any more. until next time :PMy first Usage impression----------------------The 3D effect is quite amazing, you really do feel like you're in a different world, but you'll feel the full effectwhen you start interacting with the world, and it's so nicely done with those controllers, they are so intuitive and comfortable.It does give you the ""wow"" effect when it comes to the full experience.But, if you're expecting to enter the ocean and see everything crystal clear as if you're really swimming there, then the VR experience is still not there. It's not terrible, but the screen quality is not satisfying enough (more details below).More about the display------------------------------One of the things i was waiting to try with this headset is watching 3D movies.I was quite disappointed because the quality is not that good, which makes the entire thing not enjoyable.The main issue is not the resolution of the movie, but the problem is the low resolution of the screens in those headsets and basically the distance between the pixels.You might not notice it when you're watching your regular computer monitor, but try getting your eyes very close to the monitor on a white page and you will suddenly notice a little black margin between each one of the pixels.When you're wearing the headset, you have 2 little screens right next to your eyes so you do notice a thin black grid, it's like you're watching through a flyscreen.You're starting to forget about it when you're playing a game and interacting with the world, but if you're trying to watch a movie, you'll quickly realize that you rather do it on your computer monitor than sitting in a virtual theater while wearing the headset.Still, it's worth mentioning that after reading about it over the net, people stated that on the RIFT the grid is less noticeable than on the HTC VIVE.The resolution is obviously going to be improved in the next generation.* Edit: An example of that is HTC's new headset, the ""VIVE PRO"". the image is so much clearer. But I wouldn't recommend that headset any way because the image quality is the only advantage, everything else is a disappointment, including the insane price.Gaming with the Headset----------------------------------Don't expect to find a big library of quality games for VR, but still, there are enough small games in order to keep you busy and findsomething suitable for your taste.One game i was waiting to try is a boxing game called ""The thrill of the fight"", it's basically boxing in VR.My sister tried it, my GF tried it, my mom, my dad, my mom's friend... everyone LOVED it and were swinging and sweating like crazy.Some even screamed :)It's more than just something to try and forget, You can actually play for hours.What you're doing in the VR is also visible on the computer screen so it's a lot of fun for the entire family.Make sure you have enough space in your room (at least 2x2 meters) to allow you to move.Sports without leaving your room-------------------------------------------Just like the boxing game I've mentioned above, you can find rhythm games, tennis games and other games that can get you tiredreally quickly and make you sweat without leaving your room.It has actually become my warm-up regime .Motion Sickness----------------------If you get motion sickness quite often, then you might get it here as well.I am a bit sensitive when it comes to motion sickness and there are some VR games that i basically can't playbecause they make me feel bad quite quickly.When it comes to other games, i am trying to not play for too long in order to avoid sickness.It's different for each person and it gets a bit better when you get used to it, but it's something worth mentioning and beawared of.Conclusion - does it worth it?---------------People are sometimes complaining about the fact that you're not just paying for the VR but you have to pay an additional 1000$ for a suitable PC.I don't agree with this statement. You shouldn't buy a new PC JUST for the VR experience.If you like playing computer games and you have a suitable PC, then in my opinion 350-400$ are worth it.I think you'll have enough hours of fun to justify the price.If you're planning to upgrade your computer somewhere soon any way, then this headset might be the reason to finally do it.*** July 2018 Edit: Nvidia is about to launch their next generation video cards in the upcoming months, if you're planning to upgrade your PC, don't do it yet, wait for the new video cards and your PC will be ready for the next generation of VR as well. ***If you don't play games but for some reason do have a high-end PC and you want to watch those VR movies that you see on youtube,then just buy some cheap glasses for your smartphone such as the google cardboard. You don't need a full VR set for that.BUT if you're not playing computer games, or you have a computer that suits your current needs but not good enough for VR, thenI don't think it's currently worth buying a new PC.Yes, it is fun, yes, it's entertaining, but the quality of the games that currently exist is still mediocre, VR is still new so it willtake time till we see some dedicated large-scale VR games.Therefore you can wait a couple of years until there's better content and even better headsets without feeling that you're missing much.

My husband has a Vive and I have a Rift. I rather my rift. The touch controllers are amazing. The problem is that its quirky. My sound has been bad since I got it. The left ear got buzzy than went out all together. Now neither side works so no sound from the headset. I started a ticket with occuls  and they wanted me to send it back where it would ether be replaced by a refurb. The thing was literally Two weeks old.  So id be without my headset for weeks and get a refurb back? I just paid for a brand new one. So  got Bluetooth headphones and use that for sound. Its a pain but it works.The software does not play well with the driver for my usb3 card. It keeps telling me to update my usb drivers and they are up to date. Tracking on my sensors jumps around a bit sometimes and I wonder if its due to the drivers.All in all fun but im not happy with the bugs. I hate how the ticket was handled especially after seeing that the sound problem is a very very common problem on the rift. It seems like the sound just goes out.

Habe mir diese VR-Brille vor ein paar Wochen zugelegt und würd sie leider nicht weiterempfehlen.Positiv:- Das Gefühl wenn man diese Brille zum ersten mal aufsetzt ist genial! Man ist in einer anderen Welt und verliert sogar das Raumgefühl.- Controller funktionieren gut, liegen wunderbar in der Hand.Mehr Positives fällt mir aber auch nicht mehr ein...Negativ:- Es gibt nur wenig Spiele die wirklich Spaß machen. Mir selbst scheint es als wären die spiele und das ganze System wohl doch noch nicht ganz ausgereift.  Auch wenn es schon ziemlich viele Angebote gibt, sind die Games eher mittelmäßig.- Längerer Spielspaß ist nicht vorhanden. Spielen mit der VR ist eher anstrengend als entspannend. Zocken ohne VR macht immer noch mehr spaß!- Die Brille drückt ziemlich ins Gesicht. Wird nach längerer Zeit unangenehm bzw. man hat danach immer einen Abdruck im Gesicht.- Die ganze Grafik aller Games sind nicht richtig scharf. Jede Schrift bzw. Beschriftung wirkt verschwommen.Negativ²:- Oculus Rift funktioniert nur mit der eigenen Software 'Oculus Home'. Das Menü bzw. Programm ist einfach nur schlecht. Die Software wird Automatisch mit jedem Game aktiviert, auch wenn man keine VR Games spielt!- Es kommt oft vor, dass der PC beim starten die Kopfhöreranschlüsse der VR als Stanardlautsprecher auswählt. Nervig.- Seit ich die Software Installiert habe, braucht mein PC fast zwei Minuten zum herunterfahren!!! Keine Ahnung wieso das so ist.- Datenschutz ist sowieso eine Frechheit von Facebook!In ein paar Jahren sind die Brillen sicher besser ausgereift. Werd mir bestimmt keine Oculus mehr zulegen, sondern lieder eine HTC kaufen.

Hallo,Schon als ich die DK2 bei einem Freund bestaunen durfte, hegte sich in mir der Wunsch eines der ersten Consumer VR Sets zu besitzen. Da die Oculus derzeit so dermaßen drastisch im Preis gefallen ist und laut vieler Reviews bequemer für Brillenträger sein soll, entschied ich mich also für dieses Modell. Amazon lieferte wie immer flott und zuverlässig. Die Verpackung macht schon mal viel her: sowas kenne ich sonst eigentlich nur von Apple Produkten. Dann ging es zur Installation. „Nicht genug freien Speicherplatz auf C:\“. Ok, was soll das? In meinem PC werkelt eine Intel 750 SSD mit 400 GB die nur zu 1/3 gefüllt ist. Ich brauchte 5 Stunden Recherche um rauszufinden, dass der Installer wohl nicht mit dynamischen Festplatten umgehen kann. Das ist ein schlechter Witz, da erstens so ein Problem irgendwie in die 90ger gehört und zweitens man ohne seine gesamte Festplatte zu formatieren mal nicht so schnell von dynamisch auf fest wechseln kann. Ich musste mir also noch ein zusätzliches Partitionierungsprogram für 30€ kaufen, welches ohne Datenverlust das Umwandeln bewerkstelligte. Wirklich dreist ist eigentlich nur, dass Facebook/Oculus laut diversen englischsprachigen Foreneinträge wohl bereits zu DK2 Zeiten von diesem Problem wusste und eine „baldige Lösung“ in Aussicht gestellt hat.Das Erlebnis (als es dann endlich funktionierte) war allerdings großartig. Fürchtete ich ursprünglich das Fliegengitter, so muss ich zugeben, das es kaum auffällt. Definitiv eine große Steigerung im Vergleich zum DK2. Was dann aber gleich wieder alles madig gemacht hat, war erstens die schwierige Kommunikation mit Steam (ich finde man sollte bei einer neuen Technologie so offen wir möglich arbeiten und nicht versuchen ein Monopol aufzubauen) und das z.B. Mindcraft erst durch viel Troubleshooting zum laufen gebracht werden konnte.Letztlich hat mich der Totalausfall in dieser Woche aufgrund eines abgelaufen Zertifikats allerdings dazu gebracht die Rift wieder zurückzuschicken. Mag sein das mein Timing und meine Komponenten halt zu exotisch sind und ich deshalb Probleme hatte die 99% der User nicht betreffen werden. Mein Eindruck ist jedenfalls unglaublich fad, weil mir scheinbar deutlich mehr Zeit in die Softwareentwicklung gesteckt werden muss.

The touch controllers are fantastic! Rift has a whole library of games that are only for Rift. You can play almost ALL steam games! This is lighter. But the main reason is the controllers.I really like this and Robo Recall is fantastic (comes free to rift). I wish it had co op's, that would make it even better!It is a little tricky at first figuring out how to navigate around and how to open and close the windows. I will be getting the wireless when the price gets back to normal $350 on amazon... I got the 3rd sensor and it's funny to take the mask off and realize which way you are facing... Tracking is spot on all the time. I like that it comes with built in headphones and they sound great. Cables are too short but active 3.0 extensions fix that right up.******UPDATE: 30 October 2018So I got a game and knew I didn't like it after playing for 21 min. The game was 50gb. I looked at the refund policy and saw that I was eligible for a refund. I requested the refund and uninstalled the game. I got an email saying the refund was denied. I only had it for 2 days... I emailed oculus support as to why my $39 refund was denied and got the response in the image... ""Even though they can see I only played for 21 min, they cannot give me a refund because I removed the game""??!!?? There is no phone number where I can contact them so I am not able to call and complain... There return policy does not say that you cannot uninstall the game that you want to return!! I was telling all my friends to only use the oculus store but have now been saying not to. I have linked oculus to Steam almost all the games are there as well. You can have the steam games displayed in the oculus home so you do not even have to go to steam VR.Sorry for yelling, this just makes me mad...

TOUCH CONTROLLERS: One or both of the controllers WILL need a return eventually. There is a rather common problem with triggers sticking. Save your box with serial numbers still attached. They will ask you for photo's of it on the box it came in. Along with photo's and/or a video of the controller issue you are having before they will issue a replacement.The issue is with the the soft cushion pads inside the trigger mechanism. The pad will slowly migrate as you use the triggers and eventually cause the trigger to stick closed and be useless. Some lucky people have only experienced the pads causing an annoying clunk with each trigger pull.That said. It is the best controller system at this time in terms of gaming. I would still rather have these than the Vive's wand even after the issues.Some DIY fixes are out there if you want to void your warranty. But these touch controllers are not easy to open yourself. The returns take about a month to complete. And in the states the manufacture warranty is only 1 year. They also started selling single controllers now for about half price. Probably due to this issue.HEADSET:I have used both Oculus and Vive. And the best HMD as far as quality and detail is definitely the Oculus. Even though their specs look similar on paper, it is night and day to me.Oculus is far better for racing experiences, space sims, video, and other media experiences where you need to see detail and distance.Vive is better for spacial experiences. Seeing things out of the corner of your eye then reacting to it. Because you can look around with your eyes more and it stays focused without having to turn your head 'as' much.The pixels in the Oculus are closer together and have a smoother look. They have far less space between each pixel. So everything feels more 'filled in'.In contrast, with the Vive you can clearly tell it is fat RGB type pixels even in the middle of an object. Especially bright ones.PRICE:I know people who buy surround sound systems for $1500 and a $1000 TV to go with it. All for ""immersive sound"" to feel like they're ""in the action""Then they cry about the price of actual VR at a fraction of that price?I get that it's not the same experience. It's BETTER for LESS. And they end up with a computer system they can do a lot more with outside of VR as well. So I think the price is just fine.

I don't recommend buying this device over the Vive but I also don't recommend buying the Vive. VR is great. I loved having this device. The problems are simple and I'll list them quickly:1. Oculus has NO glasses support. NONE. What it considers to be a solution is a hack and you risk damaging your lenses (on the device, mainly), will have your face smushed and pressed, and the overall comfort levels drop to a painful level.Vive has glasses support. Both have 3rd parties (I recommend 3D printing + Zenni but there are dedicated websites for each HMD if you'd prefer to spend a bit more (but likely for less quality on the lens, more on the frame) ) and 3D printed DIY (or order said 3D printed bits) options available for effectively snapping lenses into the headset. The result basically being that you've got a comfortable option as opposed to mashing your face into the HMD. It'll cost ~$45 in total (I have -6.00 vision and went for Anti-Glare, Anti-Scratch, Anti-Oil, Anti-Blue light, ect. though you can save $5 on blue light filter I'd HIGHLY recommend spending the $10 to not have to wipe the thing down or live with glare).2. Games. Not many exist. Most are overpriced for what they provide you. I'm not saying that the devs are greedy - it's not that at all - it's just that flat games and VR games are very different, have different amounts of players, ect. It's a risk. A ""hit"" in VR is looking a bit like a 5 / 10 in flat games. Not only do few people have a VR setup, few people even have a PC to begin with. This shouldn't stop you from buying into VR but it should give you reason to wait for Gen 2.3. Controllers. Oculus Touch is MUCH better than the Vive Wands* but Vive Knuckles are coming.4. Tracking * BUT the Vive tracking system is superior by far. If you're like me and live in an apartment then you may initially expect to just be sitting down or standing in place and find the idea of screwing things into your wall to be difficult or against the rules or w/e. Trust me. You won't have a choice. Seated experiences aren't VR. The more space you have, the more fun you'll have by EXPONENTIAL amounts.5. God Rays. Both suffer from this. You'll think your lenses are smudged but tl;dr it's just that both headsets use lenses which warp the light in a way that makes it look greasy. The Vive lenses do this in a ridged fashion which makes it worse but also somehow makes it less noticeable by diffusing it a bit more (spreading it out).6. Screen door effect is hardly a problem and only affects objects seen at a distance, really.7. Resolution is low enough that text and the ""Windows desktop but in VR"" both remain too blurry to use comfortably. Games don't suffer much from this at all but I look forward to next gen displays.8. FOV - Put simply, by default it appears that things are smaller in VR than they are in real life. I say this based on Skyrim and VR Videos. No matter the source, all humans appear smaller than they should and it's noticeable. Ignoring that, it still feels like you're EVER SO SLIGHTLY missing out on some peripheral information. Not a ton, but I think the increase from 110 to 135 degrees will improve things quite a lot.9. Heat and sweating. I only have the Rift for this but with the official foam and whatnot.. I needed a fan for intense games like Beat Saber after ~15m.

I can't wait for the resolution to increase so I can actually enjoy clear images. Keep this in mind before purchase, the image will be pixelated to blurry(close to far away) and you cant read text very well for virtual desktop. Open the debug tool to increase the resolution the game is rendered at so the picture is sharper but you can only do so much and need a strong graphics card for this. I'm a gamer but really I rather they increase the resolution quite a bit in the next headset and upscale games or use old school graphics to keep high frame rates. Onward is graphically like PS1 level but super fun, wish I could see far away. Make the image sharp Oculus, worry about realistic graphics less.Program FIles>Oculus>Support>oculus-diagnostics>OculusDebugToolIncrease Pixels Per Display Pixel Override number between 1.0 and 2.0 and change Visible HUD to Performance. Run a game and look to see if the headroom is doing OK and that you're maintaining 90FPS. Increase Pixel Override towards 2.0+ if your card can handle or drop back towards 1.0 if it's having issues.

Overall I liked the VR experience and the games are fun and the setup was easy enough.  However, it only worked for about two weeks and then suddenly one of the headset headphones started going in and out like it had a loose wire.  I payed $400 for this?!?  I'm sending it back tomorrow and I would not buy it again but I already invested MORE money (that would not be refunded) in a few games so I'm going to give them one more try.  Hopefully I don't get another lemon.Honestly, it really doesn't seem to me like this product was tested thoroughly:  1) One side of the Velcro on the headset's top strap is extremely small making adjustments difficult.  2) The foam used in the headset is AWFUL!  It's scratchy against the skin after only a few minutes.  3) The foam also absorbs sweat so playing with a friend or family member and alternating the headset can get pretty gross.  It needs a material that can be wiped off (like SCUBA mask material) and not something spongy that traps moisture.  4)The cables could use at least another 5 feet of length.  5)The touch controllers are nice and work well in games except for the placement of the menu buttons which cause unwanted pausing in some games like Beat Saber.  Beat Saber actually had to issue a game update to combat this problem.  6) Resolution is terrible especially when you are used to high def monitor.Followup  Review:  I got another lemon!  Just received my second Oculus Rift and the headset lasted about two days before my computer would no longer recognize it.  I've never EVER been so absolutely completely dissatisfied with a piece of hardware in all my life.

This item will transform how you gaming.  It did for me and my son.  He's 33 now and we've been gaming together his entire life... every console that came out.. 1990 ( I had the Atari 2600 in 1979..... Sega, Nin64, all of them including all Xbox and many PC builds; I think we've played almost everything.You absolutely must have a very good video card (GPU), fast CPU, extra RAM....!  I enjoy racing games... this simply transforms the immersive affects to almost unexplainable.  Games like Dirt Rally, Assetto Corsa, pCars 2, R3E (Race Room Racing Experience), Redout (old F-Zero like game) and of course iRacing.  These are all fantastic games and are amazing using the Rift.My son loves RPG and FPS... Arizona Sun, Climb, Super Hot, and many others with the Touch Controllers are like WOW... crazy Fun and amazing.I highly recommend The Rift if you have a machine that can run it.  Was simple to setup and was running in 30/40 minutes even after running touch calibrations.Enjoy... VR is here for good.

I'm gonna be honest here. I'd much rather support HTC and Valve than Facebook, but with their price being so much higher I decided to get these as my first step into the world of VR. And WOW, I am so glad I did!! The headset is similar to the Vive, but the controllers are so much better and way more flexible in terms of what you can do with your hands. I love that the Touch controllers actually have joysticks instead of the dumb touchpad of the Vive's controllers.BUT HOLY SWEET BABY ZEUS, VR is way better than I had expected and even hoped! It's a little tricky to get set up, and the Oculus software leaves a lot to be desired (I've had several crashes/freezes, and there are some setup sequences that you can't cancel without exiting the software... SUPER annoying), but overall I can't believe how awesome this technology is! There are certain games where you totally lose all sense of yourself and are transported entirely to a different world. It's incredible. And the games out there are surprisingly good and well-developed! Never in all of my life have I wanted to play video games so much, and I consider myself past the age of typical video game addiction. I literally can't focus at work because all I want to do is go home and shoot some stuff in VR!As far as the product itself goes, I'm sure it will continue to improve over time, as the screen is still fairly pixelated, the headset is not as easy to adjust as it could be, and the foam on the back of the headset literally serves as a sponge for sweaty people, making it really unpleasant to pass the headset around, but overall it works incredibly well and completes the task of immersing you in the game.For those wondering if they should get a third sensor, I say absolutely. I tried the ""experimental""  360-degree tracking with the two sensors, and for the most part it did the job, but with a third sensor it was absolutely flawless, and is a must-have for full immersion. Even with the third sensor you're still coming out $140 ahead of the Vive. Spend that on some games, cause they're not cheap!I've had a computer powerful enough for VR for a while now, and I can't believe I've waited this long to try it out. Sell some stuff out of your garage if you have to, because this was worth every penny I spent on it. Others will surely disagree, but I myself am extremely impressed. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go play some more VR.

I have been playing with my oculus rift for about a year and I can say that i love the damn thing and I can't go back to normal pc gaming. So i try to find anything I can get that may make the experience even more immersive. So when I heard oculus had a earbud version of the headphones I started saving up money. However, as I much as I wanted to like these I just couldn't. If you are like me you probably talk alot when your in game especially when playing a game that requires communication like onward or pavlov. Now the first and worst thing I noticed about these is that since they go inside your ear they basically provide as a  earplug and cancels out every sound from the outside word. which may sound good but once you start speaking you can hear your own voice inside your head. This bothered me extremely and I couldn't play like this even though I tried to ignore it. I wanted to see if other people had this problem. So I invited some of my friends over to test them out and see f they had the same problem. I realized that although they can hear they're own voice its very easy for them to ignore it and therefore they had a great experience. There is no doubt they these sound great and provide better immersion but speaking from my experiance I didn't like but most people would not have the same problems I had so I can recommend this as a replacement. Just try to test yourself but pluging your ears with ear plugs while wearing your oculus at max volume. if it bothers you alot then you'll probably have the same issue I had any way thx!!!!

Great product.  3rd sensor really improved response on my rift system.  Having the Inateck USB 3.0 controller is critical tho.  You will want all 3 sensors on an independent USB 3.0  card. Otherwise you will get tracking errors. With the right setup this is a great product.  I installed it initially trying to use a spare USB 2.0 port.  It constantly failed with tracking errors.  Once I got the Inateck USB 3.0 card and put all 3 sensors on it, everything worked beautifully !

I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a PC capable of VR. I bought the Oculus Rift first and then bought the Samsung Odyssey VR Headset second for comparison sake.Here is the pros of the RiftPros+ Great for Gaming+ Oculus Home is awesome. You can personalize your own virtual room. Better than Steam VR Home in my opinion.+ Best VR controllers (Oculus Touch Controllers) of all the the VR headsets hands down.+ The tracking is great with 2 sensors that are properly placed but better with 3 sensors.+ The lightest weighing of the 3 between the HTC Vive and the Samsung Odyssey+ The Best Value (2 great tracking sensors, 2 great controllers, 6 vr apps included upon installation)Cons- The foam that rest on face soaks up sweat, but its removable and can be replaced with 3rd party alternatives.- Total resolution of 2160 x 1200 compared to Samsung Odyssey's 2880 x 1600- Due to the resolution above, the screen door effect is more present opposed to the Odyssey- The Oculus Touch controllers are fingerprint prone, so buy silky microfiber cloths to clean off fingerprints and lenses.Here are my pros for the Samsung OdysseyPros+ Clarity, Clarity, Clarity. Don't get me wrong, the screen door effect is present and more so if you focus on it, but watching 2d, 3d and VR videos are what this excels at.+ As mentioned above, it has a resolution of 2880 x 1600 (1440 x 1600 per eye), so going from the Rift to Odyssey, its immediately noticable, especially with 4k content.+ Was able to easily play all my Oculus and Steam VR apps easily (Beat Saber, Super Hot VR, Box VR, Moss, Whirligig & moreCons- Being that it uses inside out tracking and requires no sensors, the tracking is ok when in decent lighting, but nowhere near as accurate as the Rift or Vive.- The controllers just feels like a downgrade after coming from the Oculus Rift. For instance, I wouldn't want to play Box VR in them because you can not ball your fist opposed to the Oculus Touch controllers, which takes away from immersion. They also feel less durable to me as far as build quality. The led lights look nice though.- The weight of the headset is heavier than the rift, but feels more quality than the rift.- The front of the Odyssey is glossy, so once again, buy silky micro fiber cloths to clear fingerprints for those with OCD like me.- Windows Mixed Reality Home aka Cliff House doesn't hold a candle to Oculus Home, plus its been reported to impact performance negatively when open, but there are ways to bypass it.OverallIf your main VR use is for VR games- Oculus RiftIf your main VR use is for VR videos (3D movies, VR Adult Content) and you crave resolution- Samsung OdysseyIf you want the Jack of all Trades- Oculus RiftIf a rift is too expensive or you don't have a great GPU for PC and want taste of VR minus the best games- Oculus GoIf you are not ready to invest in VR now and have patience, research Pimax 5k+, Star VR, and Oculus Quest

I could not be happier with my purchase! I have been wanting a computer VR for several years and finally pulled the trigger. Installation was a breeze once I got my USB ports configured out correctly (I was only able to use 2 of my 3.0 ports instead of 3--still works fine.) Unless you try a good quality VR like this, you cannot fully understand how immersive and awesome it is to be in the VR world. I have a mid-range computer--nothing special but good for all around gaming and you would never know it. The graphics in the Rift are sharp and clear and I get no lag whatsoever from moving my head or the controllers. It is an amazing experience! Right now, I am at work on my lunch break and all I'm thinking about is coming home to play with my Oculus Rift! Here are some of my thoughts on my experiences.The Oculus demo: you are in a room with a robot, computer, a 3d printer, techo butterflies. you can grab things and throw them, you can drop cartridges in the air and they float as if in space. Very amazing demo. Very amazing intro to the rift.Subnautica: I have been playing this game on steam for around a year. Great game, looks stunning in VR--under water, the fish, the monsters, the depth, etc. The controls need work. You still have to use the mouse and keyboard or from what I understand a game pad. I wish it used the wonderful touch controllers.Google Earth: Was not as awesome as I thought it would be. It looks like you are flying over a model instead of the earth because of computer generated scenery.Tilt Brush: Amazing painting program. Paint in 3d. Walk around your artwork. See what others have made. Very cool!BigScreen: A free app on steam. I watched a movie on what appeared to be a 100' screen (and it seemed as if I was in a movie theater.) I was exclaiming, ""Wow--this is awesome!"" and I heard someone agree to my right. I looked over and a dude was watching the movie with me. I talked to him for a few minutes. He was a cartoon character but his mouth moved perfectly when he talked. A very incredible experience--this is how I will probably watch Netflix and YouTube in the future--the screen was large, clear and smooth FPS--very cool!OnWard: A CS-Go type shoot-em-up that probably takes place in Iraq or something. It looks like you are in a town fighting insurgents. The sound, the graphics, you hold a rifle with both of your touch controllers. Reloading is grabbing a new clip and placing it in the rifle.An absolutely amazing experience. I find myself crouching behind walls, peeking around corners, ducking, aiming through a red dot scope and getting shot a lot. Unless you experience this great game you can probably not understand what I am talking about. I am not kidding. You look and feel like your are fighting a battle. Your brain kicks in and you are worried about being shot!All in all, I could not be happier. I almost spent the extra to get a Vibe but I paid $349 for this and I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. As of right now, I have 5.5 hours away from going home. Tonight I am going to fly a little X-Plane 11 (can't wait) and maybe watch a movie on a 100' screen. Buy this!!!

Facebook found an exploit in Android software and used it to their advantage. They took all the contacts in my phone and used them for advertising purposes without my knowledge or permission, and without the knowledge or permission of the people in my contact book. I never let any application on my phone access my contacts for this very reason. An exploit they found let them do this. Android has since patched it. I found this when I downloaded my content from Facebook and saw that the ""Information shared with advertisers"" section had all of the contacts in my phone. I have since removed any application owned by Facebook.Oculus is now owned by Facebook, and will be requiring me to have a Facebook account to use it. This makes it impossible for me to use it, since I will never install another Facebook application.I've contacted Oculus and they will not refund the money for the Oculus and games. I'll be seeking a class-action lawsuit to get them to either stop the Facebook requirment, or refund the money to the users for the equipment and all the games.

if you have been thinking about getting into VR but like me, aren't sure you will like it...you WILL.My first day was pretty tame, I did Google Earth (very cool) and explored some ancient Egyptian tombs. That was all fine and dandy, but I wasn't seeing a $400 purchase. I decided to give it a few more days before I started the return process, and oh boy am I glad I did. The free content is nice and all, but where the Rift really shines is with the paid content. Makes sense, right?To say I was unprepared would be a huge understatement. I put on one of the premium games it came with, Robo Recall. After getting jumped by killer robots I spawned in my ""office"", which is essentially a tutorial on how to use the controls and a target shooting range. I fooled around in there for about an hour, playing with the deactivated robots and shooting targets. Finally, I decided I was confident enough to venture out on a 'recall' mission. Recall means destroy.First one robot went running by, and I went pew pew and it died. Hey, this is fun! The pace picked up and I was recalling right and left, like a well-oiled machine kicking ass and taking names. Cleared the first mission easy, and got some shotguns. You start out with pistols and when they are out of ammo you just drop them and draw new pistols from your waist holsters. It's alot more intuitive than it sounds. When you want to use your shotgun you literally reach over your shoulder and draw it, but it only has 3 rounds so your pistols are your main weapon. By this time the gameplay had picked up some, and I realized (through seamless prompts) that I could knock incoming bullets out of the air, some real Matrix type stuff. By then the robots were coming from all sides and up behind me, and eventually one got close enough to me that when I ran out of ammo I literally just grabbed it and tore it apart and used it's bits as a club to fight off the other robots in arms reach. After I pushed them back some I was able to start using my guns again, but that's enough about gameplay. I fought hard and fast, recalled a lot of robots, but eventually, they got the best of me.Here is where it gets interesting to me. As I respawned in my office, I saw one of the deactivated robots I had been playing with before, except this time I was PISSED at it. Yes! I was physically and emotionally ANGRY at those robots! To say I was immersed is an understatement. At this point I decided to take a break and settle down, as I had been swinging, shooting and cussing for a couple hours straight.Coming out of VR is a trip too. The graphics out here in this reality aren't as good. I had to sit quietly and calm myself down while waiting for my brain to get re-centered. I will never go back to regular old 2D gaming again. After fighting off hordes of robots with graphics of such quality that I actually believed I was in a city street I just don't see myself taking much joy from a regular old mmo anymore. Gaming will never be the same for me after trying the Rift. They say that we are still in the stone age of virtual reality, and that much more is yet to come. I'm looking forward to it. What we need is the Next Killer App(TM), something like the Oasis would be hugely popular and would help bring VR into the mainstream where it belongs.Don't hesitate to get this, you  _will not_ be disappointed.

Got this for what I think is a fair price of $60 and absolutely recommend for any standing VR experience, as facing the opposite direction with only 2 sensors always resulted in mistracking and completely breaking immersion. With 3 sensors tracking is flawless in any direction, and allows far greater immersion and tracking. For me it was a no brainer, and $60 was a small price to pay for the difference in performance.

I got my first Oculus Rift, and research said that buying a third additional sensor was necessary if I wanted accurate tracking. So I bought one.This sensor is exactly like the two you receive with your Oculus Rift. It comes with a 16-foot extension/repeater USB 2.0 cord, which should be plugged into a USB 2.0 slot (The main two sensors should be in a USB 3.0 slot).Does having a third sensor help? Yes, it does. Instead of having two sensors in the front tracking your motion, a third one behind you will fill any motion tracking gaps those two may miss. Not all games will need three sensors for tracking, so double check the games you intend to get and see if you'll need this.

THE GOOD• Jaw dropping experience: I've tried VR before on the PS4 and the HTC Vive, but only the Rift blew my mind. It felt more immersive and high quality than the others. Every guest I have over tries it, and they've all felt amazed. They end up wanting to get one afterwards, even non-gamers.• Amazing content and games: I was hesitant to dive into VR because I feared the lack of content - I was wrong. I've been aggressively buying games for a month now and there always seems to be a lot more unique and fun things to try. Additionally, there are lots of competitive games out there where you could sink dozens maybe hundreds of hours into.• Cheaper than competitors: The latest price drop from $600 to $400 makes the Rift much more accessible than what it used to be.• Reliable and immersive: Everything just works. The sensor setup, spacial tracking, touch controllers, the software etc. I've been using the Rift for a month on a daily basis and I haven't found any big issues.THE BAD• Requires expensive gaming PC: the minimum requirements to run most games is high and will likely stay that way for the next few years. If you don't already have a gaming PC, it's going to be a hard sell, if you do already have one, I think it's a no-brainer.• May require an adjustment period:  This varies by game and person, but you might get dizzy the first few time you try it. I've found that after a few days you get used to it.• Still feels early-on for optics tech: There is a ways to go with optic and display technology to get the visuals right. Things just aren't 100% HD crisp, but I'd say that they are more than enough to get to an immersive experience where you forget about the technology and just enjoy the content.• Large play area needed: Not everybody has spacious empty living room or bedroom spaces. Although Oculus recommends a 7ft by 5ft area, you can get away with a little less.OVERALL• 4 / 5 stars - it will blow your mind.• If you are a hardcore gamer or enthusiast, I strongly recommend getting the Rift.• It still doesn't feel ready for mainstream given cost of required specs.• I see lots of improvements coming out quickly. Oculus is a large company within Facebook, and they are investing a lot in VR. You could argue this is the biggest VR company around.

Now, Don't get me wrong, I have a Rift and a Rift S system and am still enjoying one of them.  They both work rather well,  but it hasn't come with small problems, from the pins on the triggers backing out so the triggers fail to return back. To the cover coming off of one of the controllers.  The inside out tracking occasionally glitch in game but for a portable system its great not having to setup cameras.  And finally on the rift controller drift.  Sever enough to not be able to play many titles.  And replacements are either used and in poor condition or price gouging as the company (Oculus) no longer supports them.  I am writing this with a bit of heart ache. As for all the flaws, and issues and no longer being supported. The killer for me is the Facebook requirement.  If you have Facebook, fine.  But I do not any longer and will not get back into it just to purchase another headset from this company.  I am done, I've had enough.  I have probably spent close to $2,000 on two headsets and games.  And I will not go forward in supporting this product.  It wasn't the best, it was just a few short years ago a good value.  But the value has been slowly stripped away by big corporate in my opinion bone headed decisions.Enjoyed it, had fun, but in the end left disappointed.  By hardware from a company that sold out to a company that makes millions from your user information, and lost what was good about them in the first place.I'm not angry, just a sad.

Coming from a Vive year. I wanted a rift because of these controllers.  Why? Because my $300 msrp Vive controllers were giving up to ghost (touchpads).  Think I’m crazy? Look up the review of their controllers.  As much as I loved them for their heft and best tracking. I found these to be better build quality and are much much comfortable to use. Coming from a guy who mostly plays a game called “Rec Room” I usually do pvp paintball matches with these.Pros:1) Lightweight, great for quick aiming and shooting in fast moving situations. Also I injured my arm outside of VR. And these lightweight controllers helped me play for long sessions compare to Vive.2) They use AA batteries, while it’s a drawback that you can’t recharge them like you can for the Vive.  They do last much longer at 30+ hours. And if and when the batteries do die, you can just simply swap them out instead waiting for them to be charged.3) Use joysticks rather then touch. Though I loved the touch on the Vive controllers. My hands sweat a lot and they don’t preform well when this happens, besides broken pads. The joystick is best for me side I’ve been use to the joystick for almost all my life. (Eg, PS3, Xbox controllers) They do have some drawbacks compare to Vive.1) Their lightweight makes it much harder to have a study hand for things like sniping. Also doesn’t feel like you’re using a tool with these. But rather using your bear hands.2) Tracking isn’t best in class compare to Vive motion controllers. (But not noticeable if and when sensors and USB drivers are behaving correctly.3) Button placement could of been a tad better. Like I accidentally hit the menu button from time to time. But I do go aggressively with these (swinging my arms, etc)

I'll update this review as time goes on but I've now spent a weekend with it and here are my thoughts so far.Build quality:---------------------------Feels like they put effort into it. The controllers are solid, the headset is very light (which is what you'd want), the adjustment straps are velcro but it does make it easy to adjust while having the headset on. I just found that the velcro strip that goes along the top of your head should need a longer hook patch as it doesn't accommodate people with small heads very well (not me, but friends). They could have made the foam going around your face to be a more interesting material but it does the job of making things comfy quote well.Controllers-----------------Very intuitive and comfortable. Very well designed and responsive. No cons that I can think of until they get to next generation technology with hand recognition. These do the job wonderfully.Sensors------------I love that they come with their own stands. It means that I could put them on my bookshelves above my pc and be gaming straight away. They also blend in quite easily with the environment and have suitably long cords.Headset-------------Extremely comfortable to use. The headset is super responsive and along with the controllers really give you that lag free feeling that you're looking for. A user just needs to spend a little time customizing the fit and position so that you hit the sweet spot of focus, and then your jaw will be dropping from joy. The resolution is acceptable and the only con of this generations headsets. It doesn't detract from the game's enjoyment in any way but when you want to read fine text you'll need to focus a little harder to do it than you would otherwise. The vive pro would probably be great on that aspect but not at the current price. Some people complain about the light gap around the nose but while playing it isn't noticeable at all for me and is actually helpful for when i'm trying to find a controller, keyboard or my coffee. I would then purposefully look at my nose for the gap and then find what i'm looking for without taking the headset off. With regards to the audio, I come from an audiophile headset setup and I don't feel like I'm losing out too much. Perfectly capable sound and the positioning as you turn your head is spot on.Experience (for a new vr user)----------------------------------------OMG! It has changed my gaming landscape completely. I have to be pulled away by my partner before I put this down. When I ordered this headset I was merely curious about some of the games it came with and some of the games that are made for vr, but I knew I wanted to try some specific games as they had VR support and are more substantial. The two games on the top of my list were Project Cars and Subnautica. These two games don't use the vr controllers but don't let that stop you trying them out. OMG (again). Project cars is worth playing for the pure fact that you can look into corners as you turn. It's a simple thing but makes such a difference to your experience of driving. Subnautica is where I spend all my time now. The immersion under the water really gets you lost in the world and makes a really good game even better. I'm tempted to buy Skyrim VR but only when i'm done with Subnautica.Was it worth it: YES YES YES. I will likely want to upgrade to higher res headsets but that will only be next year when the prices come down. For now this is still totally worth it and you are doing yourself a disservice by not getting one.

It has been very rare in recent years that any new piece of technology has brought a huge grin to my face.  The last time that happened was when I bought the Oculus Rift.  I pre-ordered my Rift, and have had it since just a couple of months after Oculus started shipping the CV1.  That was an amazing, trouble-free experience with technology that actually worked as advertised, which is almost unheard of in this day and age.  Well...Oculus has done it again.  After a dubious flirtation with a horrible, clunky, cheap-feeling VR system recently (the Samsung Odyssey), I decided to return that unfinished piece of garbage and get back to using my Rift.  I had gone with an ""upgrade"" to the Odyssey, because I was looking for hand controllers, and I had also heard that the resolution was so much better than the Rift.  Some upgrade...the whole thing felt very cheap and flimsy, and was a major pain in the rear to get set up.  On top of that, the tracking of the hand controllers was so intermittent, that it defeated the main purpose of getting the Odyssey package that had both a headset and hand controllers.  So, I returned that (bought it from a local retailer), and came to Amazon to buy the Oculus Touch controllers to work with my old, trusty Rift CV1.  The whole setup process was a joy from start to finish.  When the Oculus software didn't like something about how I had my sensors set up, it didn't simply refuse to work like the Odyssey did.  The Oculus software actually tells you exactly what the problem is, and gives you suggestions on how to fix it...even tells you which direction it wants you to rotate a sensor.  Once that is all done, the Oculus software runs you through a short, and really fun, VR sequence where you are interacting with a robot and other things in your environment.  By the time that sequence is done, you have learned how to use your new Touch controllers.  Not sure exactly how it does it, but it even knows the positions of my fingers, and knows which buttons my thumbs are hovering over on each controller...and lets me see that in the virtual world!  That's an amazing thing that takes away the frustration of not being able to see your actual hands and where the buttons are on the controllers.The Touch comes with another Oculus sensor to make it work, and that has had the added benefit of dramatically enhancing the tracking tolerances of the headset.  It wasn't just there for the Touch controllers, it also made the existing headset tracking much more reliable at extreme angles.  I primarily use the Rift for flight sims, and sometimes you have to turn your head over and down to see side consoles in a military jet.  With only one sensor, sometimes the headset would briefly get ""lost"" at those weird angles, and the exact placement of the sensor was critical.  Now?  I can be anywhere, with my head at any angle in my VR gaming space and the tracking is solid.I also like the seamless integration of the good old Oculus software with my flight sim (DCS World), without the need for screwing around with a 3rd party app that just hogs more computing resources.  Granted, you can't use the Touch in that, but that's probably not far off in the future.Thank you Oculus for releasing such great products that actually work, right out of the box, with a minimum of self-inflicted hair loss!

You really get a *lot* for $349.  At this point in time, that price and what you get cannot be beaten by its competitors. You get the visor, 2 hand controllers, and 2 room sensors so it can track your position.  These are mostly for ""front-facing"" tracking, i.e., they probably couldn't see something behind your back.  For true 360 room tracking it does require a 3rd sensor, sold separately.THE GOOD: Room presence and hand tracking using the excellent hand controllers is amazing.  You look down and see your hands in the VR space.  Being able to reach out and touch or grab items is very immersive compared to simpler products that can't do this.  High refresh rate means the screendoor effect is minimized and a good App makes you completely forget about it.  Higher FOV than the mobile products is also pleasant.  Flexibility of content as you can use the Oculus store, the Steam VR store, or any 3rd party app or game that supports the Rift.  Head and body tracking is quite good.  The ""guardian"" feature that maps your play space or room and gives you a grid to warn you that you're approaching the boundary really helps you from tripping over or bumping into anything.  Easy access to your PC using the ""virtual desktop"".  A slick storefront from Oculus that gives you easy access to content.  The hand controllers are excellent, best of any you can get in the VR world.  They really do become ""hands"" in the VR space and they are quite intuitive to use and become second-nature after only a few minutes of use.  The sense of presence in the VR world is significant with the sensors and controllers giving you freedom of movement and to use your hands.The visor is somewhat heavy-feeling, but it screams ""quality"" and has integrated headphones for 3D positional sound and they are actually quite nice and sound great.  The visor is more comfortable than cheaper ones and has effective straps for making it fit just right on your head.  I can wear this visor for longer than some of the others I have tried.  The unboxing is amazing, you feel instantly like you have bought a seriously high-end, premium tech product.  No Apple device was better packed or presented.The visor comes with several free games or experiences.  DEAD & BURIED is a cartoony western-themed zombie shooter that is amazingly fun and hair-raising at times.  It's also multiplayer.  I found myself with 3 other people all talking and communicating as we stood in a storefront area of an old western town firing away at zombies assaulting us.  The cartoony look of it is the only thing that kept it from being occasionally very alarming - when those zombies get up in your face, you can't help but flinch, your mind very quickly accepts VR as your current reality, and the sense of scale and of ""being there"" is remarkable.  There are horror VR apps and I would advise you to only experience them if you are somewhat stout of heart.  In VR the programmers can keep track of which way you're facing, so the monster can ALWAYS be behind you, if you see what I mean.  VR horror is going to cause some heart attacks, and probably needs disclaimers.  It's quite unsettling - which will totally thrill some people - and totally horrify some others.VR is tremendously good already for flight sim, cockpit sim type of games.  It's so much better than playing that kind of game on a flatscreen monitor, the ability to move your head around and feel as though you're really in the plane or spacecraft is a huge improvement over flatscreen gaming.  You have a large gamut of different kinds of apps and experiences in the Oculus or Steam VR stores.THE BAD: The software is buggy.  The installer froze and had to be restarted.  The sensors are finicky and their placement has to be no more than 6 feet apart, and the initialization of them and the setup process would time out and have to be restarted.  Once I got it working it was great, but the setup seemed a bit buggy and a little frustrating.There is no ""focus wheel"" like the Gear VR has.  You must wear this visor with good vision.  But it's not great for wearing with glasses that could scratch the lenses.  I was forced to wear contacts.  What it actually *has* is an ""interpupillary distance"" setting that helps people with eyes set further apart/closer together.  This was never an issue for me in Gear VR, but the focus wheel in Gear VR was extremely useful.  What this ""premium"" product is inferior to its cheaper cousin in this regard is truly a mystery to me.The Oculus store has MUCH LESS content than the one for Gear VR, a partnership between Oculus and Samsung and their visor that works with Samsung smart phones.  Samsung has pumped a lot of content into that solution and it's easier to find Free apps and you seem to have a lot more content in the Gear VR store than the straight-up Oculus store.  The Oculus store also pushes paid apps and makes finding Free ones not so easy.Despite superior hardware in most respects, screen resolution is nearly identical to Gear VR and the experiences are often pretty much the same.  The Rift's hand controllers are far superior to the simple controllers of Gear VR and Daydream, though, there are really no comparison there.  I honestly came away from this with a lot more respect for Gear VR and what it's been able to accomplish with a relatively inexpensive visor and a smart phone - it is a compelling experience in most ways.  The Rift's room sensors and controllers do place it up into an entirely different and higher tier of product for VR, moreso than the screen resolution or refresh rate.Steam VR is pretty simple to use with your Oculus Rift, however I found the controller mapping to be not QUITE as smooth, and rather than actual hands, in the Steam VR apps you see the controllers themselves in the VR space.  That's not nearly as interesting or compelling as seeing hands that you can use to touch and grab things.You're tethered with a 10 foot HDMI/USB 3.0 cable and that's not very far to move.  You might want a longer cable, and you might sometimes trip over it if you are backpedaling.  Being wired is kind of an anathema to VR and I look forward to future versions that can support this kind of bandwidth, speed, refresh rate, and quality of experience wirelessly.

I have been using the oculus rift + touch for about a month now.  Originally it functioned well.  However, the tracking performance has been deteriorating, and now I can't play for more than 20 seconds without the touch tracking becoming horrible.  While making movements in full view of both sensors (and even sometimes when staying still), the Touch is either detected wrong (completely wrong location or angle, such as 10 feet away pointing backwards), or loses tracking entirely.  This makes many games unplayable.  I have attempted completely redoing setup, and wiping the sensors with the provided microfiber cloth, with no luck.  My play area is the recommended size (5x7 feet), but the sensors are failing to track even in the center of it.I originally really enjoyed it, thus 2 stars instead of 1. However, after paying the $1000 needed to get a better graphics card, the oculus rift+touch, various games, mounting hardware for the sensors, and stand for the headset, as well as the 5 hours rearranging furniture in my apartment to create an open play area, for it to perform so terribly is a kick in the teeth.  Don't waste your money on the rift.

Having demoed both this and the HTC Vive, I was instantly sold on the future of VR and just HAD to pick up a headset. Like many others reading these reviews, I was torn between the Rift and the Vive as to which one I liked better. Obviously youtube is full of video reviews and comparisons between the 2, but these were the things that jumped out at me.Weight: this headset is far lighter than the Vive. If you ever try both of them, it will become immediately noticeableControllers: The oculus touch controllers are better than the vive wands in my opinion. They are more ergonomic and provide superior hand presence, although they require batteries instead of being rechargeable. That being said, the battery life is fantastic on the rift and should last you a long time.Tracking: This is where I was really torn. The tracking on the vive is better, needing only 2 lighthouses to the oculus' requirement of 3 cameras for a roomscale setup. Along with that, the Vive's cables are much cleaner than the rift's, as the vive uses only power to get proper tracking, while each oculus camera plugs into your computer via USB. Creates a spaghetti mess really quickly!Price: This is what ultimately led to my decision. While I was concerned that Oculus would just be turned into facebook in your face, while most of us probably prefer steam since we already have an account and manage our libraries there, the Oculus was $350 at the time of purchase to the Vive's $600. Even with the cost of the extra camera, you are almost $200 below what the vive wants, along with some great games like robo recall and lucky's tale.Bottom Line: I was going to wait for gen 2 before I ever tried modern VR, but the experience was that great for me and was akin to my first time popping super mario 64 into a N64 and playing a 3d game for the first time. This is the future, and as many may say, the FOV isn't your entire FOV, and the screen door effect isn't too bad and never really breaks immersion for me unless I stop and look for it. VR is the future, and if you have the GPU for a proper experience you will love it. Try it out yourself, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it as  much as I do!

After six months of trying to get it to work reliably, it still fails most of the time. I FINALLY got it to work reliably by jumping through hoops and doing everything just right. But then a mandatory software update broke that process, and now it crashes evrytime! Worst code I've ever seen. I hope someone else starts selling a similar product that actually works!Getting it to work is a real pain! Just downloading the software can be problematic. Many details must be considered to get the software and hardware to work, VERY finicky. But when the stars align, it works, HOLY COW! it is awesome! I got it working quickly when I received it, but it quit after 3 days. Oculus support DOES NOT have phone support, so if you have problems you will be emailing for 3 or 4 days.And we could never figure out why it kept saying ""hardware error"" for the rift. Returned it and got a new one, then also had to do a system restore from before it quit working. Then the new one worked. My only guess is that maybe my Nvidia driver auto updated and broke it, or there really was a hardware issue. ??? Support not very good. AND, be advised they are now only supporting Win 10. So if you are on win 7 as I am, they will not support you at all. But as I said, when it works, it is a whole new world of cool games and experiences. You'll ;ove it!

When I first got the Rift, I couldn't take it off. I adored the interfaces and games to no end and would play for a few hours at a time, but beware of the stark reality of this system. This is a beautifully smooth, and responsive party trick. Don't get me wrong, I love this device, but there is a certain limit to how much you really care about using it. I used it nonstop for two months and now I simply haven't touched it in just as long. I bought about a dozen of games (ranging from physically exerting, to casual, to nonstop motion sickness) and all of them I had fun with. Occasionally when you would start to sweat from the movement or the motion sickness kicking in, the lenses would fog entirely. I believe this fits a niche market of gamers, and I believe everyone should use it at least once in their lives since its just such a neat piece of tech. However knowing a few other guys who bought rifts when I did, all of us seemed to put them down in different amounts of time relatively quickly and we just went back to the keyboard and mouse gaming we are accustomed to. This is my experience with the rift, overall a wonderful piece of technology, but I would argue it will be a passing novelty for most people.

First off, VR is not something that you can just tell someone about. You can tell them but they have to ""experience"" it.I am totally blow away. I'm having a blast with the experience and the current games that are available. There is more coming, personally I'd love to see a Star Wars Game or some big Movie Action game done. VR has the power to take you their and put you in the game. Before you ask yourself should I spend the money ""just do it"".The software has it issues but for the most part runs fine. From unboxing and loading the software and drivers I was up and gaming in about 30 mins. You will need an internet connection to get setup, the unit does not come with an install disc. I chose to setup the software with a standard account and not join it to my facebook account. I had my reasons but since oculus is owned by facebook, the option is available to use your facebook login for the oculus store. Think of the oculus store like the steam store, it is the platform for all your purchased games and it allows you to play them. I also went ahead and installed steam VR which allows me to play my steam vr games on the headset, it works perfectly.I had a small issue getting the sensors setup so the rift was comfortable. It was very picky about how far apart they need to be verses what direction they face. I am playing in a small area and have had no issues with the motion controllers not working or the headset itself losing signal. In the setup program you can setup a play area. This is helpful since you cannot see anything in the real world with the headset on. If you go out of bounds it will put in a grid (think Tron) that lets you know your too close or getting close to objects in your room.The sound on the headset is amazing and does a fine job of surrounding you with what is going on in the game. I could hear Zombies behind me and other sounds shoot across the sides of my headset as I was playing. The sound is built into the headset so you don't need a separate pair of headphones for the rift. I suppose you could get some but I use what the headset comes with and was more than satisfied.You can save the box the unit comes in. It is padded and allows for storage when your not using it. This will also protect the unit from dust and other things that may hurt it. It also has a build in handle. I guess the concept here is that you can take it over to a friends house and use it but I'd make sure his computer can handle the specs first.I personally cannot wait to see what they come up with next as far as games go. I already have a long list to play but I've just added more to that list because I have seen the VR world.

Ok.GOOD: If you are doing real Private Pilot training, this system is for you.  I use this, coupled with CH FlightSim Yoke USB and Logitech Saitek PRO Flight Rudder Pedals to simulate my flying experience.  It is amazing how much this has helped.  HIGHLY recommended.BAD:I'd understand if I have been using this hard, as in jumping around and stuff.  However, all of my operation has been seated because I almost exclusively use it for flight training/practice.  But, 1 year (minus 1 day) my left ear speaker started blinking in and out (mostly out) sound.Update:  After posting my issue here and submitting a support ticket (I had done this immediately so in case there was a send-it-in issue, i'd already have that covered), I got responses from both Oculus support here and from my submitted ticket within a day.  I'm impressed with this level of support.  The issue has been resolved.

This worked for about 3 hours before the headset gave an error and stopped working. After rebooting the computer I have been unable to successfully boot fully with graphics. I was unable to fix it yesterday and I’m still working on it today. The best my local support folks could come up with was the onboard graphics drivers were wiped out by Oculus software. If I could get a stable boot they said to uninstall the software and update the graphics drivers. Too bad I can’t get back to a stable point. Worst case I have to wipe the drive and do a clean install of Windows 10. Before installing the software for this back up EVERYTHING, make a restore point, make a recovery disk, etc. And update your graphics drivers *first*. Recovery didn’t work. My computer is now a brick. Proceed with caution. Hope my kid enjoyed his 3 hours of Christmas fun before his computer was killed.

I finally pulled the trigger and bought the oculus after waiting years! I was not let down! It has completely changed my gaming routine, I no longer sit for hours, hunched over my desk. Now I am standing and dodging and ducking and my gaming sessions are now a hour long and I get my fill compared to before it would take all day.Multiplayer is seamless and really fun, it feels like you are right there with the other people.I thought it would be a nightmare to set up but it's so easy! Don't be intimidated, seriously, it's simple.I watched all kinds of videos comparing the Vive to this and Oculus and I am glad I went with oculus as the controllers are way better and with a 3rd sensor it tracks about as good as vive.Do what you have to to get the money, ask grandma, sell a kidney, pawn your engagement ring, JUST GET IT!You will be so happy with the rift, open your mind to another world!Please upvote if you found this helpful, as I subside solely on upvotes.

In the package it states that you should visit the website for ""important steps"" to using a 3 sensor rig for 360 tracking. In reality it's plug and play with one specific condition. You can only have 1 of the 3 sensors plugged into USB3.0.Once that condition is met, just re-configure the tracking and guardian boundaries. You're good to go.First thing I noticed is that the micro stutter is gone when I'm aiming down a scope in Pavlov. I've also noticed that I can actually throw things with some speed now. Before I was running 2 sensors on a 10x15' play area and there were small dead zones I would run into if I got too close to one or the other camera, I was also having an issue with the tracking following my hands properly when transferring inertia to an object. Making grenades just as hazardous for me as the other guy. Not having those issues anymore, so looks like this was a good fix for the little things that bugged me in full room-scale play.Hope this helps anyone else looking to resolve some of the tiny issues they may have experienced with experimental operation modes on the rift. Or those who were thinking; ""Do I 'really' need 3 sensors?"".

Amazon originally sent me a USED version of the Occulus, despite me buying it NEW. It had dandruff on the headset, grease on the controllers, dead batteries. I was pissed.But I am overseas and paid a buttload on shipping, so I was going to keep the thing anyway. Unfortunately, the headset turned out to be defective and I couldn't even get past the Oculus setup without the headset cutting out and crashing my computer.Thankfully, Amazon has good support. They were willing to send me another headset and fit the bill of the shipping for me to send it back to them (internationally). The replacement was NEW and worked great.Overall, this was a frustrating ordeal, but due to Amazon's great customer service I am only docking 1/2 a star for the frustration of having to mail the thing back, wait for a new one, go through the CS routine, etc.If I were rating the Oculus alone, I would give it a 4 1/2 stars. The fun factor can be through the roof. Watching VR videos is amazing, and games can often be a blast. The first time you step into VR it can be mind blowing. You can play for hours and then you take your headset off and realize that it's night... lol. The only negative is the resolution isn't all that clear sometimes depending on the APP that you're running, and ghosting is a real problem sometimes. I'm running a VR ready PC, and I still get a noticeable amount of lag. But it's still 100% worth it.So 4 1/2 stars minus a half star for sending me a used unit to begin with. 4 stars. Go get your Oculus. $399 is dirt cheap for the experience.

Pros: Excellent controllers. Responsive buttons, strong hand-guards prevent you from accidentally smashing the side of your hands.Good Build Quality. Entire unit feels solid.Comfortable. Played a 4 hour game session with no discomfort to speak of.Great audio. Was not expecting quite as much volume or quality as I got. Won't compare to high-end sets, but better than many gaming headsets.Fantastic Tracking. Followed all of my movements very well.Bundled Software. Included games and programs show off what the Rift is capable of. Robo Recall is probably the most fun I've had in a while, though short.Cons: Many traditional movement schemes in games can cause motion sickness in some people. (Many VR-specific titles use alternate methods to reduce this)Lots of cables, Will tie up USB connections very quickly (3 base, 4 if you a third sensor.)Moderately low developer support. There's more now days with Bethesda jumping in, but be sure you know what you want from this before buying.Screen-door effects. This will happen to just about anything that's a few inches from your face without insane resolutions that aren't possible in VR just yet. Might put some people off if they're not in it for the experience over graphics.Room-Scale. Turning around doesn't work quite so well with just the two sensors.If your serious about walking around, Pick up another sensor.Lack-luster sensor mounting options. Vive had the great idea for base stations to set the sensors up. Oculus could stand to use that idea.Other Thoughts: I wear glasses and had no real problem using this headset with them. Find and read the glasses compatibility notes Oculus provides.Set-up is somewhat long if you don't have a place ready for your sensors. My desk is a fairly cluttered L-type so getting optimal distance without angling is difficult for me, but would be very easy in other situations. I.E, Putting them on an entertainment center or similarly long surface.I love my Rift personally and can't wait to see how VR develops. If you're on the fence, It's more about the experience. I'll never forget the first time I stepped into that virtual world... If the technical limitations bother you, Wait. If they don't, Go for it!

Make sure your computer has a good enough video card before you buy this!  Mine did, but my husband's computer needs a better video card, and because of the bitcoin craze, they're hard to get for a realistic price (although bitcoins just plunged in value, so maybe that won't be true anymore.)Their are some applications included, but be warned that they often don't go onto your account as they are supposed to.  I still have to get around to dealing with Oculus to give me those ""free"" games.You will have troubles with the Oculus if you wear glasses.  I've read that you can use a prescription lens adapter from Widmovr for $65.  My husband is planning on checking these out.Now, for the fun stuff, after you own this awesome headset:At Christmas this year, Oculus put on a daily sale with two different games on sale each days for 12 days.  Needless to say, we got a bunch of games.  Superhot VR is a fun, physical game.  The graphics are as simple as can be - the opponents are red figures shaped like wooden, bendable artist's models.  Hit them, shoot them, etc., but live through the whole series, and you open up the different variations, like real time, etc.  Superhot has been the game I show people and they go ""WOW.""  I play Racket: NX a lot, too - you can work up a bit of a sweat on that one, and make sure you have nothing around you, because you're going to be swinging like you were playing a 360 degree version of tennis/table tennis.  Beats Fever is physical and fun, but needs to have more songs.  Other games I've enjoyed:  Please, Don't Touch Anything, which is a simple puzzle/exploration game; The Invisible Hours, a mystery where you follow any character around the ""movie"" at any time; I Expect You to Die; Lone Echo, where you're a robot out in space with a human and a malfunctioning space ship.  We got more games, unfortunately one thing we found out is that most of them don't have multiple saving points or characters, so either my husband plays them or I do, and I haven't had a chance to play some of the ones he is.  That's the most frustrating part of the Oculus games.If you love computer games or video games, you will love the Oculus.  If you like watching any era of the Star Trek universe, you will love the Oculus.  When I play Lone Echo, I'm floating around in a space ship.  When I play Racket, I'm swinging at that ""ball"" like it's really flying at me.  You can fly over the globe in Google Earth.  In the worst games, it's like playing a 3D video game.  In the best, you feel like you're right in the middle of things, grabbing objects, ducking bullets, playing a racket sport.  This is totally the future of gaming.  At some point, this will be a disruptive technology, as you get the ability to walk around the Louvre without leaving your gaming room, and play doubles tennis with any other three people over the globe.This weekend I'm buying OrbusVR - the only game I'm planning on buying until next year's sales, and just because it is the first game that sounds like it might challenge World of Warcraft for a MMORPG experience.

I have owned this product for a good amount of time now, almost 2 years. It has not let me down and has just worked. I have not noticed any issues with things wearing out but I will say I'm not exactly a prolific VR gamer. I bought an extra sensor with this to bring me to a total of 3, 4 would be ideal.The difference between 2 sensors and 3 was night and day, it is basically a requirement for certain games.My PC specs have evolved a little over the time I've had this but I started with a GTX 970 and that ran everything I wanted very well. No super sampling or very little, of course. It still looks good to me. I ended up upgrading to a GTX 1070 Ti because I was hoping to be able to get to a smooth 90 fps(iirc that's the magic number) for a more steady gameplay experience. I've heard that can help with VR sickness. I see the screen-door effect people talk about but I only really see it when I'm looking for it. It is there, but your focus is generally on other things.Speaking of VR sickness, I only ever got that in one game. A space game, floating around in zero-g the second the world twisted diagonally it just broke my body and I was instantly nauseated and had to take the headset off. It went away after not too long and I just never played that kind of game again.This makes my face seat really badly sometimes. I had to buy a fan to blow up at me to get some airflow into it because it was that bad. Not everyone is a sweater but if you are then just expect this and try to find a way around it. I think a different facepad would be helpful.I extended my headset cables so that I wasn't tethered so closely to my PC and that was a big help in not tripping over the cable or accidentally walking a little too far. I ended up having to purchase some active HDMI and USB extenders because it did not work with a simple analog extension. I believe I went with 15 foot extensions for both so the length may have been the reason for requiring active cables.I would definitely buy this thing again if given the choice. It has been an awesome experience to own one. With newer VR devices coming out perhaps this will see a price adjustment. The one thing I dislike about this headset is all the cords. Wireless is definitely the future and I can't wait to try one of them. I can't knock any stars off for this though, it is the way it was built and I knew that going in.

I've had the original Rift for years now and got great value add because my kids really love it.  Recently I got Quest 2 and can honestly say it's not worth the upgrade if you are coming from this. The tracking is super accurate, the refresh rate is fast, and the audio is amazing.  Cons are the lower resolution produce a screen door effect but the colors, black depth and smooth motion are much better. The controllers feel far more comfortable then the Quest 2 and it's just comfortable all around.  I wish this was still manufactured and supported because I'd gladly pay for an extra base station.What's the Quest 2 got over this?  There's a higher resolution but jittery tracking combined greyed out blacks actually make me prefer the original Rift.  A big plus is the lack of ports and cables required for the Quest 2.  The RIFT requires 3 x 3.0 USB ports plus an HDMI cable which makes a wiring mess and that's without a 3rd base station.  The Quest 2 requires none and you can still stream your PC wirelessly.  The trade off is tracking accuracy.  You can master Beat Saber easy on the Rift while glitching right past blocks frequently on the Quest 2. Yes you don't need a PC for the Quest 2 but I'm a PC enthusiast and like the extra horse power.  Recalibrating the Quest 2 takes seconds while the Rift takes 10 to 15 minutes.  With good wireless, you can untether with the Quest 2 and use any room in the house.With all that said, my kids keep asking me to hook the original Oculus Rift back up and that's is my litmus test for which product is better. I'm tempted to oblige them but having no cables is far more house friendly.  Married men will have happier wives if you go wireless.  Avid gamers will appreciate the original Oculus Rift far more.

the Oculus experience is outstanding, so buy it, because it's really game changingyet the two stars come from my personal experience: over a month of trials to have the software installing on a perfectly working win7/64 (in every of its aspects), without results; after trying everything you can find in the forums and contacting support, I tried the install on another win7/64 system, same result .... just a coincidence?, and, just three more coincidences!, the software installed smoothly on two win10 systems and one win8.1in the end, I refused the suggestion from support to format and reinstall the full OS (I have five perfectly tweaked and working huge simulators installations onboard), and I installed a second OS (win10), on which Oculus performs correctly.my point is that I strongly criticize such a high end expensive product whose software has such a great shortcoming, for which the solution proposed is just to reset the system (moreover, there are people in the forums telling that even that won't solve, thence losing a lot of time)perfect Amazon service, by the way

This VR headset is great.The controllers are very ergonomically built. My hands never get tired and sometimes I forget that my hands are gripping on to them because it feels so natural.The headset seems to be light enough that you also forget about it. I have yet to find my cheekbones or my nose to be sore from holding the weight of the headset.The only problem I have ever had is my back being sore from standing for so long but even then you could play games while sitting down.The game selection is wide ever since the compatibility support from SteamVR. You could play tons of games that sometimes even say that they only exclusively work on the Vive.The whole thing is very easy to set up. I have only had problems due to the recommendations that it gives me on where to put my sensors. This is something that you can ignore which I do.For those that are sure on this purchase, make sure you buy a HDMI and USB 3.0 extension cable and not just a regular cable. The oculus has its cords plugged in straight to the wiring which makes it so you can't unplug the wires it has. The wiring it has is small and thin so it isn't as thick as what the Vive seems to have. Also, with the extension cord make sure you find the right cord for 5m/16.4 ft if you want to get that long of a cable. The signal can be bad depending on the cable and if you don't get the right cord, you could have to go through the effort of returning and buying another.

There is nothing you can read or that I can write that will even remotely approach, descriptively, the experience of putting this thing on and having the digital time of your life.  All jokes aside, there are some serious considerations you must address before you buy:1.  Your play space 7' X 5' is preferred2.  The bundled cords my not be long enough to reach your computer3.  The better your system, the better your experience (MY OPINION, but hard to for me to refute).  I can stream, work and play congruently with multiple windows for multiple displays because I completely exceed the recommended requirements for this device (by a lot).  My photos include additional/recommended/optional accessories.  Since I think that it'll help, here are the extra items I had to purchase in order to have the absolute best experience with the Oculus Rift:1.

Honestly, I wish I had this list before I bought my gear.  I placed four orders before I got all of this to my rig.  I hope that it helps you.  Just getting into the Oculus Rift?  Unless you're playing while sitting and you have a large enough desk (at least 3' of clearance between your sensors), you're going to need to extend your OEM Rift cables.  There's not getting around it.Best Wishes everyone!

I have come to despise this thing. I am beyond disgusted with the whole messIn no time at all it is getting worse and worse with tracking, connectivity etc.  USB problems are endless, tells you to upgrade USB drivers for the headset when there are none better to upgrade to. The longer I have had it the worse it gets, I have holes in numerous walls trying to find a new place to mount sensors to make the one game I even cared to try in VR (Beat Saber) usable. The longer you play, the higher the level game you choose the worse it gets, wont make contact with anything at times. miss after miss after miss, I lose vibration and know its a failed hit before it even misses. I have bought the extra sensor and reset the tracking over and over and over and over. It is getting worse and worseEither this unit or the MB or both are trash or incompatible. OR possibly the cables which were the recommended by everyone, the (Cable Matters USB 3.0 to USB 3.0 10' Extension Cable). My MB has no other problems whatsoever with anything but this.https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C7SA21UI spent $100's and $100's of dollars to build a new computer a month ago to run this trash and still not there. This is an all new system. The Rift is two weeks old. I have looked for answer everywhere. No one else is saying this MB is having problems but USB problems and tracking problems with the Rift are endlessly found. The odd thing is that at first it seemed to work perfectly with 2 sensors and within 2 days it was headed downhill. I didn't even use it the last 8 days of the two weeks I have had it and fired it up tonight and it is as much worse as if it had been degrading even when not  in use.I have run out of ways to move and place the sensors, they have been from the floor to the ceiling and all around.Mother Board is an MSI X470 Gamer Plus.

My kid likes it, and plays Beat Saber.  He loves showing it off to Aunts and Uncles when they come by.VR systems in general, and Oculus in particular, are not significantly cheaper than a gaming console (and in most cases, are significantly more expensive than a gaming console).  The Rift is not standalone - in addition to the device, you need a gaming rig.  One with the firepower to hook up to this will cost real money, even today (notwithstanding that the Rift is now at least a generation back, having been replaced by the (better in every respect) Rift S).If you already have a solid gaming rig that meets the recommended specs (don't bother with the minimums - it will technically work, but you will constantly find yourself frustrated,) a VR set can be a fun addition that will allow you to add to the library of games you already play.  If you don't, I would invest in a good console and library and exhaust that first, turning to VR when you run out of other options.  Adopt later.As an alternative, get an Oculus Quest (or Go or the like,) which is essentially a stand-alone VR console.

You can get the same experience without the hardware requirements or wires on the Oculus Go. While the Rift is capable of providing a superior experience when paired with high end hardware, very few experiences tap this potential. Being tethered to the pc makes room scale experiences impossible. Returned after a weekend because it failed to deliver an experience equal to PSVR; which amazed me. I was expecting to have a better experience from using a powerful PC, but was disappointed when it didn't even match the console, let alone outperform it. If you are considering this, I recommend you find somewhere to demo the PSVR, Go and Rift then determine for yourself if it is worth it.

There are some aspects of VR that are amazing, the immersion is great and playing around with guns in VR is very enjoyable. BUT ...The graphics are crap, there is no way around this. After playing for a bit, you do learn to look past it, but the graphics are decades behind a monitors fidelity. But the biggest problem of all, is the lack of actually working correctly most times.Not one time, have I went to play something in VR and had it simply work correctly on the first try, and perhaps for someone with patience for that type of crap, this would be perfectly fine, but unfortunately, nothing on this earth makes me more angry more quickly than a piece of electronics that refuses to do what it's supposed to do. If I could return this I would, I wish I'd just given up early on, because its the biggest waste of money I've spent on gaming in a very long time.I just about threw the thing across the room a few minutes ago, after spending nearly 45 minutes trying to get a game to launch in VR (Note : A game I've previously played in VR) , but no matter what I did, it just kept launching it in desktop mode and put it on a theater screen with no head tracking. VR has so much potential, but I spend more time angry trying to get it to work, than I do actually enjoying the games.

I did everything I was supposed to do. Latest graphics card driver (Radeon 980). Sensors aligned. USB 3.0. Everything worked beautifully. Downloaded a bunch of games. “Superhot VR”. My sons loved it. 2 hours in. 2 and a half. Greatest gift ever.Oops. Then it happened. “HDMI input not recognized”. All sorts of tracking issues. Restart. Works for a couple minutes. Then crashes again. Rinse and repeat.WHAT a &$@!ing JOKE!!!!!UPDATE. - one day later. It gets worse. After resetting the sensors, we play for a few more hours. Seems to work ok. Then it happens. It crashes again. But now the entire PC crashes. This piece of garbage has destroyed my entire PC. I am now trying to do a complete system restore which will wipe my entire PC of all software.This is an absolute nightmare. I did everything I was supposed to do. I ran Oculus’s app to make sure my PC was “Oculus-Ready”. My PC passed with flying colors. I have an iBuyPower PC with 16GB ram and a Radeon RX 480 graphics card. It meets the “recommended specs” for the Rift. Yet here I am, with two very disappointment sons and now myself having a broken PC and a massive headache ahead of me to return all this garbage now. Which is a total shame, because when it worked, it was really cool tech. But having it crash nonstop and BREAK MY COMPUTER IS NOT COOL AT ALL.

I have had this for some time now and love it. There are pros and cons which I would like to share with you.Advise: Make sure you check the minimum requirements to run VR on your computer. Once you have verified them, do it again.Pros;1. It's VR baby! If you are like me, you love the idea of a virtual environment. I can't wait to see what the future brings. Holo deck here I come.2. Certain games like Elite Dangerous combined with a HOTAS are utterly amazing. The feeling of flying through space are indescribable.3. Being able to visit and see new environments and being able to look up, down, side to side and behind you are awesome. I highly recommend theBlu. It is a sit down (you can stand) visit to three areas of the ocean. While it is obvious it is computer generated it is still amazing. I use this as a first introduction to VR for my friends and family. And they have all loved it.Cons:1. Limited variety of games. There are only so many roller coasters you can ride or first person shooters before it all becomes repetitive. Elite dangerous is amazing though.2. Image clarity is also an issue. The image is not tack sharp as if you were looking at real life or even your monitor. I understand it is a known limitation of the hardware and it is being worked on but no telling when there will be any improvement.3. Very important. You need a pretty strong computer system to run this. While I am not saying it can't be done with an off the shelf computer I would recommend a custom built system.4. VR Sickness. - If you suffer from motion sickness I would hesitate to try VR. Your eyes see motion and your brain expects motion but your body does not feel the motion. This can cause nausea in many people in the beginning. Many people get over it. I did after about a week but some people never get over it and get really nauseated when in VR.Wishes:1. More variety of games that are not some variation of a roller coaster or a first person shooter. I know this sounds kinda nerdy but I would love to see more educational. I know YouTube has entire college courses online. Would it not be amazing for those of us that were not able to attend college to be able to do so virtually?2. While Google VR is extraordinary some more travel to new locations that we would never get to see in person would be pretty neat as well.3. I have two or three community programs but there are hardly ever anyone else in them. I am sure that will get better when more people get online virtually but right ow it is kinda lonely.4. More sit down games. I am very limited in the free space I have and I look mainly for game that I can play while sitting down or does not require a lot of  movement that needs space.I would most definitely recommend Oculus Rift to anyone that is interested in the idea of VR. However please keep in mind the initial dollar investment for this. You are not just buying the headset but you also need to make sure your PC is up to standard as well as extra items for the Oculus. It is not a cheap investment in the beginning but I do believe it is worth it.

This is my first VR set that I received, and I have to say, I love it! It arrives in a big box with everything you need to set up included, and the instructions are clear and concise about what you need to do. The setup is all online, with you downloading the oculus software and following the instructions off of your computer. I love how they include an actual VR experience and introduction to its mechanics in the actual setup as well! I was blown away when I first entered it, and I still am. I constantly find myself trying to set real world objects down on tables, or sit down in VR chairs. The headset itself if very comfortable and I can wear it for hours without feeling any fatigue or motionsickness, and the touch controllers feel really good in your hand and are pretty intuitive when you use them. There are only two problems that I have noticed so far in my use. 1: In some experiences, there can be a very pronounced screen door effect on your lenses, and it looks like a fine mesh has been placed over the lenses and it overlayed on whatever you're looking at. 2: Whenever there's a dark experience and text or something else bright comes on the screen (for example, the opening screen of many games or apps), there are VERY pronounced ""god rays"" of light that come off of them, and make the screen pretty blurry and unpleasant to look at. These two issues aren't too major though, and I love the product!

Bought it, played it for a bit, then sold it to my neighbor. Here's why:Initially, it was a blast! First Contact and Robo Rally introduce you to the tech without making you throw up and they're fun to play. Even the game lobby was a wonder to behold, and Superhot made me feel like Neo in the Matrix. Yes, the image could be clearer and sometimes you'll think your lenses are dirty when in fact it's just the tech (""god rays""), but overall it was immersive and enjoyable.Here's the problem - it's 400 freaking dollars and the lack of variety in the worthwhile games means you'll likely get bored after a month. Sadly, most titles don't take advantage of the incredible interactivity in First Contact, where you push buttons, throw things into other things, and play with things that AREN'T GUNS. You can only play so many shooters and first-person environments.Part of the problem is how the developers try to address motion sickness. You very rarely move around in a traditional sense and instead ""teleport"" from location to location. Some games allow it - notably Subnautica - but free-move also tends to provoke motion sickness and so many devs understandably don't want to bother with it.After initial motion sickness with Subnautica, I'd found you can ""train"" your brain to cope with free movement and I wish there were more games for players willing to do that. I get why there aren't - there aren't enough players to justify the cost of development. You hear that a lot in VR as to why there's so many tech demos and not enough great games - ""not enough VR players.""So I sold it. I have a PC and a PS4, and as a family man with limited game-time, I was consistently choosing those other platforms. Spend that $400 elsewhere, on something with longer legs and more variety of experience.

I decided to take the plunge since this device was under $400 and the reviews indicated it is very good. I agree with most of the reviews. It works very well from my perspective but take into consideration, I am new with VR. I find it very engaging and I am only using the basics so far. One or more reviews indicated installation was confusing. I am fairly PC savvy and assumed it wouldn't be for me. I was wrong but I DO like a challenge. Microsoft said it was incompatible with their mixed reality. I don't know because so far I am avoiding MS mixed reality. I have a pretty high end PC with a 6GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 video card and multiple USB 3.0 ports. I did have to go to the NVIDIA site and download and install the newest driver for the card. The Video card has only 1 HDMI output port. This meant I would have to disconnect my Samsung 4K 32 inch display monitor which would make the additional installation steps impossible. So the first thing I did was reconnect the PC display HDMI cord to the onboard HDMI port(obviously NOT a permanent solution since this would slow down the PC display for other uses), connect the Oculus cord to the NVIDIA HDMI port and was able to install and use the device.The next hurdle was the installation complained about my ""VIA USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller""... Google to the rescue. After an hour or so of reading various ""expert"" opinions of what to do, I found one user who simply said, ""DISABLE the VIA USB 3.0 driver and see what happens"". Voila!!! I disabled the driver and the problem went away... (I may find out later I have to re-enable it for some Microsoft purpose but so far, so good).Displaying the PC via the onboard video card defeats the purpose of HAVING a high end video card for the PC when I just wanted to use the PC for other reasons. I do a lot of photography work with Photoshop and Lightroom so I was going to have to fix this. Since my Video card also has 3 Display ports I purchased a Display to HDMI adapter cord which is on the way so I cannot comment on that but I suspect that will solve that problem.My conclusion so far is that for a beginner, the VR experience is outrageous. I have a fear of heights and this device tested my brains ability to distinguish between reality and technology. I am currently only using the basic free games and functionality but I have to say, I could easily plug into the device and get lost for HOURS!!! I rated this device a 4 star because I just started using it. I leaned toward a 5 once I got into it but I will reserve that for after I have used it for a while.

(First and foremost, I bought this refurbished)That's the tricky bit, isn't it? it came with the headset, controllers and sensors like it was supposed to (no instructions but thankfully plugging it in is pretty self-explanatory), but you quite literally CANNOT use this without the internet. Unlike most other hardware that self-installs once plugged in or comes with a disk/thumb-drive with the necessary software, this doesn't. You plug it in, go to Oculus' website, and then download an application that will walk you through calibrating your gear. However, once it's calibrated, you can't run the thing without that app being active at all times, and you can't run that app without the internet. If for whatever reason you stop having internet service, you become the proud owner of an expensive set of paperweights. So if you intend on taking this to a relative or friend's house to VR game all day and night, be sure they have an internet connection.Oh, and on top of that, Oculus requires you to have an account with them. Why is that something that EVERY company wants these days? I bought your shit. Isn't that enough for you?

Took about 20 min. to setup for me when finally I was greeted with one of the coolest (most mind blowing) tutorials I have ever seen in my life.Coming from seeing the Samsung VR and only ""mildly"" being impressed I wanted to try out the real thing. Once I finally built a new PC with the mixture of the summer sale price drop, I was on board to give it a try, boy am i glad I did!!!I won't go into anymore detail but I will say a few quick notes.-I usually get motion sickness from the shuttle big screen rides in amusement parks, I DON""T get sick from this.

Let's be honest - they are Gen 1 VR - optics are as such.  NO 8 K here.  Do NOT expect the visuals to look like your computer screen.  Knowing that, they are FANTASTIC!  They WILL change the way you game.  And as a pro-tip - be sure to check out RECROOM Paintball.  It's free, and one of my favorite games now...and I was not into shooters.  I bought these for SIMRacing...and they are FANTASTIC for that too!  They make as big of a difference for racing as going from keyboard to a wheel.  Seriously.  I will never play another race sim if it is not VR.Install can be a bear -- follow the steps and expect a LARGE LARGE LARGE download.  If you run into issues, just chat with the team.  They will walk you though troubleshooting like a champ.  PRO-TIP -- TURN OFF AVAST if you run it.  Install will NOT WORK with it.  I actually had to UNINSTALL AVAST to get it to work - so that is what I personally recommend [Windows 10 (Current) | I7-6600k | GTX 1070 (update drivers)| 16G Ram].  Turning it off was not good enough.  After that, install was spot on and painless.I can run most games at fairly high settings, but do not expect to run ULTRA across the board with a 1070 and not have some issues.

Though the description clearly says ""Includes 16ft Repeater Cable"", mine came with no such cable. The included cable attached to the sensor isn't long enough to use for the back of the room, which is the reason most people would order this. Sending it back for a refund.EDIT: Since some people said theirs did include the repeater cable, I ordered another one 3 days later and that one did include the repeater cable. It was a Monoprice USB 2.0 repeater cable packaged separately from the sensor. Once I got the sensor with the repeater cable, this worked great and really improved my VR experience. I think this allowed me to put my 2 original sensors a little farther apart so it was easier to get to the recommended room size. I've had far fewer problems with the Rift losing tracking since I got this extra sensor. Given it's relatively cheap price, I highly recommend it!

This thing is awesome,  I bought a couple horror titles for it.  Such as killing floor incursion.  With the touch system,  you get 2 sensor stands and the controllers.  Your hands wrap around each controller and litterally become your hands for which ever game you are playing.  You have to actually reach out and grab guns and ammo.  Then press and hold the side trigger to hold the object depending on the games button layout. I've had it for about a week and learned the controls pretty well.  In killing floor.  It feels as if you are actually in a open field with monsters approaching you.  They will get right up into the face of your headset which is really creepy and thrilling at the same time.  This headset also comes with some really cool free action games and first person shooters.  Toy box is a free game.  It can be fun for those who like using the Oculus while sitting but can get boring pretty quick.  The only downside is that I always have a message at the top of my headset stating that my computer is not supported.  It's lacking the reccomend CPU and that is all.  As I have a AMD 8350 8-core piledriver.  But I ignore the message because it still plays smooth.  As a note.  You do need a powerful gaming PC to run this headset.  So don't think your back to school college laptop is gonna cut it.  Lol

So I purchased the bundle with the Rift, touch controllers and 3 sensors. With tax, it cost me about $500. I would highly recommend paying the extra bit for the 3rd sensor. So far, it's been a fantastic experience. I mainly bought it for Beat Saber on Steam (a must buy, especially if you mod it, which is super simple) and I've been playing the hell out of it. It should also come with Robo Recall, which is a shockingly fun shooter.It was pretty simple to set up. It'll probably take you 30 minutes, not including the download and install time. If you're rocking 3 sensors, you're going to need at least 3 USB 3.0 ports (one dedicated to the headset and the other 2 ports for the 3 sensors).I was really surprised at how intuitive and accurate the touch controls are. It makes interacting with things really fun and immersive.  As long as you have a powerful enough computer and some floor space, I would say it's worth it.

Just awesome! I've been putting off purchasing a VR headset until the games matured. I was going wait until the next generation of headsets came out, but some really good games are available now for them (Vive too).So, first the system. I had no problem setting it up. I just followed the instructions for Room Scale and away we went. The instructions recommend connecting two sensors to USB 3.0 and any additional sensors to USB 2.0 and that's what I did. The headset is connected to an HDMI port and USB 3.0. This has worked perfectly in a 6ft x 7ft play area, and the sensors are placed in three corners of the play area. We do have a wall on one side of our play area which does get hit every now and then. Ideally, you should have at least 2 feet on the outside of your guardian border to make it less likely to smack a wall. I didn't have that luxury with my current setup, but I'm seriously thinking about taking over the adjoining room next to my office. Tracking is dead on, no issues whatsoever, which surprised the hell out of me honestly because I was expected some trouble with it. Went with the Rift because I love the controllers, and since the tracking is working so well I'm glad I did.There is an issue every now and then where the Rift simply won't show a picture but will produce sound to the headphones. Its happened twice in over 20 hours of play, so this is not a big deal to me. A reboot fixed it both times. The controllers are amazing. They accurately track your thumb and pointer finger position, the other three fingers in game are controlled by the button on the side of the controller handle to grab things. The only complaint I have about the controllers is the right hand controller has developed a squeak already on the trigger button. A little disappointing because I have XBOX 360 controllers that have 100's of hours on the trigger buttons and they don't squeak and it is annoying. Not a deal breaker though, and I may see if I can RMA it for replacement if it gets bad enough.So, as for games... The beginning tutorial with the robot is great and gives you a crash course in controlling the Rift. Next we went on to Steam's ""The Lab"" which has a hand full of experiences and mini games. Our favorite by far is Longbow. The bow and arrow work exactly how you would expect it to, and is just a blast to play. Tried Bullet Train which was pretty good. Then.... Robo Recall. This game came free with our Rift, and I didn't know what to expect with it. All I can say is I've been gaming for over 20 years, and I can't remember the last time I had so much fun in a game. Maybe back in the day when Doom came out and Half Life. Both these games set standards for gaming and that is the feeling you get when playing Robo Recall. If you can think up things to do, the game developers already though of it and you can most likely do it in game. The guns are great, the physics are dead on, it's funny, it scales well and ooh boy are there a lot of ways you can ""Recall"" bots. It's also OK for younger kids (playing it with my 8 year old son), as there's no cussing, or gore. We've also had no technical issues with it, no crashes, freezes, or even game glitches. If you have a Rift, you owe it to yourself to get this game. Honestly, I can't comment on any other games right now, because this is all we have played since we tried it.I can't really comment on how this does in comparison to the Vive, but I can tell you that it does not disappoint and delivers on every level. There is a slight ""screen door"" affect, but honestly when you're in a good game it's not even noticeable. Also the graphics are not near as sharp as what you see on a 1080p or 4K monitor, as the tech is just not there yet. I knew that going in though, so it's fine for now but it does leave you really wanting better in game graphics with how well everything else works.

Pro: I had the PSVR, Mixed Reality and now the Oculus Rift. This thing is amazing some say Mixed Reality look sharper with it 1440x1440 panels. But Oculus seems clearer to me and also to anyone on the fence about it. The Oculus gave me a greater sweet spot than any VR I've used including Sony. I can set my IDP 69 and and every time I put it on. My image is clear as a bell. The Lenovo Explorer took some adjustments to get the sweet spot. Games, interface all spot one. Rich colors and very deep blacks. Love it.Con: I had my item 2 days and the price dropped to 349.99 from 399.99. I didn't even ask Amazon for credit to my card but Amazon Gift Card so I can spend the difference back at Amazon. The reps yes more than one told me I had to pack up my shiny new unit and send it back for a full refund before I could buy it at the lower price. This don't make any sense what so ever. I could've ordered this thing from Bestbuy and walked into a local Bestbuy and they put 50.00 bucks in my hand on the spot. I even asked if I could get a full credit so I could buy it first to secure the lower price and not have to wait without it so long but again it was a no. So please be aware of Amazon price/refund model.

If you have the computer to handle the Rift, you need it. With the price down all the way to $399 for the Oculus Rift + Virtual Reality Touch System, you truly can’t pass up this deal. The Oculus Rift is by far the most fun I’ve had with video games in some time.When it comes to the actual physical system, I’ve noticed a significant amount of complaints with the excess wires. The Touch System includes the headset, 2 sensors, and 2 wireless remotes. The headset requires an HDMI port and USB, each sensor requires a USB port. I can admit the wires can be a bit frustrating, but honestly I really haven’t noticed them at all. In fact I’ve actually used the wire from the headset as a reference to stay centered in the room.The tracking is amazing and the boundaries you set up for yourself around the room make punching the wall a rarity. The controllers, as designed, feel like natural hand motions and are easy to use even with my toddler hands. The headset is a bit big for my tiny-ass head, but no one else seems to complain about it, so I’ll live with it. All the features lead to a truly immersed feeling for the player.I am really blown away by this system, along with everyone I’ve also had try it out. If you’re even questing the Rift, the answer is yes. For the love of god yes.

The oculus rift is absolutely amazing - especially at such a low price.My only issue with it is something that MOST gamers will not care about - but I do - resolution. The resolution of this headset is so low that it makes it difficult to play most flight simulator games.For most normal gamers the resolution is just great, but for flight sims in particular, the low resolution is a deal breaker.I can sympathize with Oculus since a higher resolution would make it even more demanding in terms of graphics, but the great thing about resolution is that you can downscale if needed. I am definitely looking forward to a higher resolution Rift in the near future!

I’ve been flying Condor 2 Soaring Simulator with Oculus Rift for last several days. On my first try I got severe motion sickness after 10 minutes of flight, but on the second day I flew for 2 hours non-stop without much problems. Like with real motion sickness, it gets easier with practice.Regarding immersion, it’s almost complete. At first, I was concerned with the field of view, is it wide enough? What about “door” effect? Well, it’s not an issue and it doesn’t interfere with immersion. You are “there”. The biggest problem is the clarity of the image. It’s just not clear enough due to low pixel density of the displays used in the headset. It’s bad to the point you need to lean toward dashboard to have a clear view of instruments and PDA in Condor. Imagine you’re short-sighted and you forgot your eye-glasses at home.Hopefully, next generation of VR will address it, but even today it’s incredible. When I upgraded my rig, I had a choice to spend $900 on 38” wide screen monitor or buy Oculus. Oculus won with no regrets. Computer monitor just don’t make you feel like you’re there.One star off, because of image clarity.

I guess I really didn't  know what to expect but this is a is so cool. I bought the third sensor and I'm glad I did. I have been playing games on it for a few days and I love it. I mounted my sensors on the walls in the corners two in front and one in back and I had nothing but problems with setup that way. So I have my front sensors on the wall about six feet apart and the third sensor on still in the back corner and it works great. I thought I was having a USB problem but it wasn't. The Rift software can be a little misleading on that issue and needs to be a little more clear. On a side note Some of the games don't save very often so you have to go through a whole mission and if you tire out or just need to stop and your almost through that mission you will have to start over. That isn't the Oculus's problem though. Anyway Lots of fun and just unreal what advances have been made in this fieldUpdateOculus Support is being great. I have only had this for three months and I already twisted the cable so but that it broke. I know I was going to break it the way I was running around in my room. Well they are sending me a new cable and paying for the shipping. I really didn't expect that. Kudos To Oculus.

Bought this for our 14yr old son who is a gamer and a PC nut for his birthday.  He already had a gaming desktop capable of running VR.  My wife and I did zero research on the Oculus vs other well known packages.  Our son clearly stated he wanted Oculus and who are we to tell him otherwise?  Normally I would research and confirm any purchase like this, but in this case zero research = ZERO regrets.  Let me also say that I have been a gamer since the early days playing and programming games on Commodore 64, Atari 2600, NES, gameboy and countless hours in the 80's arcades pumping quarters into PacMan, Zaxxon, Asteroids (yes...I am dating myself).  Currently in our house we have a Switch and an Xbox 1 (with a Wii and an Xbox 360 packaged up for sale on eBay), all of which I play.  Bottom line is the VR experience is amazing.The good:- Set up was easy- games are immersive, we have been playing RoboRecall, Hotdogs/horseshoes/handgrenades, Gorn, Beat Saber and a few other titles.- easy for first time gamers to pick up the hardware, play and have fun- the experience is an undeniable jump from the 2-D platforms, they don't even compare- games get you off your butt and moving around a little...this hardware delivered on what the Wii could only dream of from that perspective.  This is not going to replace exercise, but you have to be on your feet to play many games and move around a good bit...turn, duck, shimmy, wave your hands around, pull the heads off robots etc.The not so good:- Cost, to put this simply...crazy expensive relative to console platforms.  The PC and Oculus hardware set us back about $1,200.  Games on top of that are another $20-60 each so far.  Many games came with the hardware, but this set up is not for the faint of heart (money wise)- Space, you do need a little bit of physical space to play.  I am 6'4"" and my kid is 5'10"", we play in his bedroom in an open space that is about 7'x7' square with 8' ceilings...just barely ok, but not quite enough space.  When I was battling robots, I reached for one to tear its legs off and punched the door frame and broke my thumb...ouch! (controller is ok though...whew).  While playing, we always have to be careful not to move too much and take off the headset to check that we are centered in the play area.  10'x10' in my opinion would be enough.- Gameplay, some of the games where you need to move around suffer from annoying mechanics (button clicks to change the direction you are facing) and they all do not share the same key or joystick strokes for the same movement.  So moving is hard to learn and you have to remember from game to game which keystrokes control essentially the same movement.  Not all games require you to physically move (Beat Saber) and are alot of fun to play.  Some have better mechanics than others (Robo Recall teleportation is fairly easy and intuitive, Hotdogs/Horseshoes/Handgrenades move mechanics are annoying)I am sure the games will keep getting better and some consistent mechanics will evolve between software developers over time.So far, that is it.  If you are really a gamer enthusiast and have some cheddar to spend, have a look, the Oculus is awesome.

Welcome to VR!The out of the box experience is just the tip of the iceberg. Here is everything I've learned to get the most out of a Rift.- 3 wall/ceiling mounted sensors for 99.999% 360 tracking (you can fudge it with two sensors placed opposite of each other for 99~98% tracking quality)- With a dedicated play space of at least 8 x 8 feet clear of breakable things, with a rug for a tactile fail safe way of staying within your play space.- Get all the USB 3.0 ports. Not having to swap peripherals out for the Rift makes all the difference. (esp. for 3+ sensor setups)- Some sort of place/setup to store/mount your Rift for easy access. (Lots of great ways you can do this. I've gone with 3D printed wall mounts)- Keep a microfiber cloth handy. Your Rift lenses will thank you for not using your shirt.- Run a fan, its incredible how much of a difference it makes.- Good quality rechargeable batteries and individual cell charging station.(More often than not just one controller low)- A swivel chair that doesn't get in the way of your arms & hands- A flight stick and/or a racing wheel. VR is a game changer for simulation games.- Comfortable space for friends to watch VR newbies lose their sh*t.- Cord Sense: If you follow these simple rules, the cable disappears.1. Keep it over your left shoulder, out of the way of your arms and hands.2. Instead of stepping over the chord while turning, spin back around. (preventing it from coiling)3. No shoes. If you are on carpet you wont be able to tell when you are stepping on the chord until its too late.And Lastly:Throw out your expectations of any particular game/experience. It's a new medium. You'd be surprised at what you might enjoy/dislike.

I love the Oculus Rift and VR in general, but it definitely has it's pros and cons.I won't go into reviewing VR itself because it would be unfair.  While I (and many other people)do experience bouts of motion sickness in certain VR games, this is the fault and nature of VR itself and not exclusive to the Oculus Rift.The rift is comfortable for the most part.  Prolonged use leaves the areas around my eyes red, itchy, and warm.  The lenses get dirty quickly.  Dead skin cells and oil seem to build up quickly and make text especially blurry and harder to read than it already is.The sound is phenomenal.  I'm not exactly an audiophile so my input on this matter might not be much.  Regardless, many times I was taking off my headset in some games/movies because I swore something happened in the room I was in.The controllers are without a doubt the best part.  Games that support them are a blast and the only thing negative I can really say about them is the lack of games using them.  i want to see more FPS shooters like Robo Recall.  Holding a robot with one hand while ripping its head off with another is definitely the most fun interactivity I've experienced in a game.I don't notice much of the screen door effect when playing a game, but the resolution/pixel density is definitely a problem when it comes to text.  I'd like to be able to lay in bed and do some desktop tasks, but you have to do some serious zooming in to read anything.Overall I'm happy with my purchase.  I don't use it as much as I thought I would as the catalog of VR games is lacking, and the hacky methods (sorry vorpx) used to get my older favorite games working with it just aren't good enough.  Your mileage may vary, but playing New Vegas with software like vorpx is more like a pop-up book instead of a full VR experience like Fallout 4.  I'd rather just use my widescreen monitor for my favorite games.It's definitely something you should get if you're a PC gaming enthusiast with money to spend.  It doesn't replace my monitor for PC gaming, but it does provide a different kind of gaming when I'm in the mood to dodge bullets.

Love it/meh it. Great for movies and with the VorpX open gl driver ($40 -Google it) you can play all of your games in vr (so long as they support head tracking) but the made-for vr games are little more than hokey point and click adventures. Sure, there are a couple of gems but I'm still glad I made the purchase. Some regular games I play in vr thanks to VorpX are Skyrim SE, Fallout 4, Deus Ex, No Man's Sky, and FF15 just to name a few. For $400 it's as good a price as you'll find. Even if you buy the additional third sensor to up the room scale you're still coming in cheaper than the Vive and this has lower PC requirements so that to me just meant more frames, which is important for vr. Also the touch controllers are way more comfortable than the Vive ones which just feel awkward to me. Hope this helps! Feel free to ask questions. I will reply timely.

The Oculus Rift works much better than I ever anticipated. The headset fits perfectly with and without glasses and is easily adjustable. The touch controllers take a little bit of getting used to, but once you do it becomes first nature and works amazingly. The built-in headphones are passable, but are definitely not the best headphones you'll ever use. Setting up took less than an hour but once you have it setup you shouldn't need to do it again. It took me about two hours to get used to the sensation of virtual reality, but managed to adapt really quick and no longer feel any kind of nausea or any other side effects. Well worth the purchase, but I do recommend getting a third sensor for good 360 tracking, an HDMI and USB 3.0 extension cable, as well as at least two active USB 3.0 extenders for any sensors that are placed further away from the PC. If you have a good gaming PC, I STRONGLY recommend picking this well-priced bundle and become a VR adopter sooner than later.

I got VR. I was so excited. Setting up the VR sounded exciting to me, but i digress. It took me an Hour and a Half to set up the 3 sensors so that the Oculus app would read my controller. After a long setup, i finally got it working, but with a tiny circle that loses the purpose of having the 3 sensors. ANYWAY. I'm playing with the Oculus and having a good time, and it just shuts off. At first, I thought I had walked too far and my cord was unplugged. Nothing was unplugged. I restarted the Oculus, It didn't turn back on. I unplugged everything and replugged probably 20 times. I then start to worry. I looked up any fixes for the Oculus not reading the cords input. Nothing works. I deal with support for 2 hours, constantly going back and forth with operators. Eventually nothing worked, so i made the decision to just return it. Luckily, Amazon was happy to take it back and return my money back the same day.......Wish i got a Vive.

I was surprised how easy this was to set-up. I was expecting to have to do my own research on sensor and room setup but the GUI walked me through everything. I did a lot of research comparing the Oculus to the HTC, and ended up going with the Oculus. Sensor tracking and room-scale is easy to set-up and works as well as can be expected. Picture Quality is good, although VR is not perfect yet, i.e screen door effect. And the content is great, I use both Steam VR and Rift.But my favorite part of the oculus is the touch controller. It is very well designed, feels natural in my hands. sometimes I forget i'm even holding a controller, and not a gun or sword or whatever it is I'm holding in VR.My favorite game so far is Beat Saber (better than audioshield imo), especially with Mods (more songs). BOX VR is cool for when I want to exercise. and 360 photos/videos and google earth VR is a fun way to introduce family members to VR

I bought these because I broke the original oculus rift headphone. I have long hair and it would get wrapped around the original ones and I finally broke one off trying to get it untangled from my hair. I thought that these would solve the problem. Granted these headphones are very very good quality, but I find myself not liking them and wishing I had the original ones again. They won't stay in my ears and fall out often, which is hard because all of my VR games are very active, jumping around, games.

If you own an Oculus Rift, you HAVE to get these controllers.  The Oculus without the hand controllers feels like an incomplete experience.  The world of possibilities that it opens up in VR is worth the extra money that you have to spend.  Now my daughters and I really feel like we're in another world when we play in VR.I have to say though, you really need to get a decently big space to play games that use the touch controller properly.  I have this setup in an area that's approximately 10 feet x 8 feet and I constantly run into the edge of the play area.My setup so I can comfortably play VR:I'd recommend that you get a powered usb 3.0 hub along with at least four to five usb extension cables that's 3 meters (~9'10"").- I have two of the USB extension cables running from my PC to my headset and one usb extension cable running to my powered usb 3.0 hub.- Attached to my usb 3.0 hub, I have one VR/IR sensor and the other VR/IR sensor is hooked to 4th usb extension cable in order have the distance that I need between the two sensors.So depending on your setup, you should consider 4-5 usb extension cables.  This setup gives me plenty of room to run around playing VR and I'm not strapped for usb connectors on my PC.  This also allows me to have my PC at my back and the sensor on the opposite wall from my PC.  Thus, I play VR facing away from my PC.  This allows me to have the cable to my setup behind me instead of to my side, where it's bound to get  in my way.  It also allows me the option of getting a 3rd VR/IR sensor for true rooms scale.  Although, I'm still playing around with the current setup and software titles to determine if it's worth investing in a 3rd VR/IR sensor or not.Good luck and have fun.

As of writing this review (2/7/19) I have only had my Oculus Rift for 6 days, but I have to say that I was satisfied with this purchase immediately after setting the system up. I sprung for the base set with the 3rd sensor for 360 roomscale and it's been amazing!After the initial setup and letting the Oculus software calibrate everything it runs you through a few steps to learn your Touch controllers. After that it drops you into an experience called ""First Contact"" where you interact with a cute floating robot who gives you disks to enter into a holographic 3D printer. It's essentially a tech demo highlighting some of the systems capabilities. When you complete the controller tutorial the screen goes dark and fades into the ""First Contact"" experience. The moment it faded in and I could look around at the room I was in... that was the exact moment I knew I was completely satisfied with my investment. I was completely immersed in the experience and totally forgot that I was standing in my living room with this headset on.Since that first experience it has only gotten better as I've worked through the library of games and tried new things. Even the Oculus Home virtual spaces feature is cool and I've had some fun interactions with other Oculus users through that platform.The complaints I have are minor and are easily being remedied with certain after-market add-ons. I purchased extension cables for the headset so I have a bit more freedom of movement. I am also going to rig up a DIY solution to have the cables suspended from the ceiling so I don't have the problem of the cables wrapping around my legs while playing games like Pavlov VR.This has definitely been a worthwhile investment for me. It has brought gaming to another level for me, and I'm loving every moment of it!

I'm not sure why my review was ""denied"" as I have read some really stupid and pointless reviews on this website. I'm just trying to give you an idea of how the RIFT performs and some background knowledge that I am a fully fledged gamer, so I know what I'm talking about.I been playing games for as long as games have been around. I had an Atari back in the day playing Asteroids on my tiny B/W Tv and can remember thinking how great it was. Fast forward to Christmas when I got a Nintendo - it was magic!Years have gone and past - Nintendo was replaced by SNES then N64 and then Playstation. I had them all.For the past ten years or so I have been into PC Gaming - with over 600 titles in my Steam library I would search through them and find nothing to play. A 40 year old gamer....nothing interested me anymore.Then VR! OH YAY Wait....$600.00 are you kidding me? Nah, pass. Years came and went. Checked back this year to see how everything was going and saw this baby for $350. OK, why not. I've spent more over the years on countless useless props and gadgets (Steel Battalion for Xbox anyone?) what could one more hurt.Package arrived within the week. Opened it up and was very impressed by how it presents itself. Watching youtube videos and reading reviews on here had me skeptical that I didn't get enough sensors or not enough cords, people warned me that cords would be everywhere.That's not the case. Two sensor set up right beside my TV - computer sits beside my TV (Monitor) I have a decent rig, nothing to write home about - but it had enough USB ports to get everything plugged in. No cords other than the one connected to the headset itself. Setup was a BREEZE for real, like no problems whatsoever. I have a deadzone right in the front of my monitor so I can't play standing directly in front of the TV. OK.Sat down to play and was literally BLOWN AWAY. I mean, for real. Granted, it's not graphically as good as say a AAA title, but the VR environment makes up for that easily.If you are like me and yearning for something else - this is definitely it. The only thing I regret not buying is an extra pad/shield cover for the headset because it does get kinda gross when you are sweating.Two sensor tracking - no problem. I've yet to have any real issues regarding tracking. Oculus software is quite beefy so be sure to have enough room on your drive (20GB I think) excluding the games. And have at least 4 I think USB3 ports on your rig as well as a decent video card with TWO HDMI ports.The future is here, its workable, its amazing, and people are still creating new stuff for it everyday. I would say if you get it now you are being a bit of an early adopter, especially with the new QUEST coming out soon. But if you have a decent computer and want to try it - I highly recommend it.Oculus has brought back the desire to play video games for me. (The games...well, meh. most are shooter types where you stand in a space or use a thumbstick to ""warp"" to another location) but BEAT SABER OMG. That should be the #1 game you get and don't forget to MOD It right away.I was also blown away at the amount of free stuff in Steam regarding VR. There is a TON of stuff and not just games, but visual novels, scenery, adventures that you can just sit back and enjoy.

I would like to start by saying that the hardware and experience you get for the price is awesome... that being said... it is accompanied by the most frustrating and mandatory software i have ever used. Used to be i could run steam games if i wanted and they ran perfectly, butt oculus decided that they didn't like that so they forced users to run steam vr through the oculus program making users take a massive hit to performance. And lately all kinds of issues have been popping up out of nowhere like random screen blackouts, spastic and random loss of tracking, and horrifically nauseating and randomly apearing double vision. None of which used to be a problem. Oculus is too concerned with updating the crap nobody cares about like the ability to stream to fb... and locking their awesome hardware into a horrible and ever worsening program. Also expect problems with the ribon cables that send signals to the headphones

I would say to anyone looking at getting into VR... really try to wait for another generation before dropping the cash. The Rift is a blast don't get me wrong but when you're coming from a world where you're used to 1080p or even 4K graphics and you go to this its a little disappointing. Now granted, it's absolutely amazing at first. Being able to interact with your environment you really get immersed but after some time you start noticing little things. My biggest gripe is the picture quality. If I'm waiting for something to load I'm staring into the little screens I can see the pixels and it makes you lose that immersive feeling. I mean once you get into the game you don't really see it anymore unless you're really looking for it. Also, it would be nice if they had something better for the foam around the face. After awhile and all the sweat that collects in there... it's kind of gross and gets itchy after extended use. I've looked at alternatives but the product should have something better than just that foam.VR is the future of gaming. This is another stepping stone towards the future of gaming but we're not there yet. Still fun to play once and awhile and show off to family and friends.

I really like this product but when I first got it and went to set it up, it took a long time to set up because my computer didn't recognize them. But after like 30 minutes it finally worked. And i must say it was amazing! It was very immersive because of the controllers as well. I have used the HTC Vive as well and the rift may not have as good resolution but it makes up for it in how much lighter the headset is and the feel of the controllers. If you are reading this when the Oculus Rift S comes out then get that headset instead. It will be a better experience since the screens are higher resolution and you don't need sensors for it since they are in the headset.

Best piece of gear i have ever bought. Extremely fun! thought that there would be a pixel issues from what everyone was saying which there is slightly but not enough for it to effect immersion. Now with the 4k and 8k stuff coming out id say if u dont already have one don't get it now and wait because your probably going to have to upgrade to the next gen graphics as well when they finally release so you'd be spending money twice, but if your ok with it i'm willing to bet that you will enjoy as much as me. Now for the cons, there's the whole usb issues with the sensors if there running on the same port you can get jitters so it requires you to buy another pcie card thats 3.0 with its on separate chip so it doesn't cut down on the transfer rate. next is lack of games and how in every fps shooter game you stand still. Very annoying to me that i have to stand there and shoot just hoard mode, but offset of that is if your into space shooters like me that's what i got it for ELITE DANGEROUS lol so i'm ok with it until they figure out how i can move IN VR. Just wish they would hurry up with it. All in All great piece of equipment and enjoy it thoroughly!

Within the first day of use, i noticed that dark areas seemed to show a flaw in the OLED panels, there is a slight green haze at the bottom half of each panel. This persisted after I reinstalled my graphics card driver (which resolved said issue for a lot of people). Due to this i believe there is a hardware issue on Oculus' part. I ordered a replacement, it that had the same issue but throughout the whole screen, being most noticeable in the left screen, even in a full daylight scene. The quality is nothing like I was expecting for the price. I wanted to keep atleast one Rift, but I have decided that I am going to refund this product due to the flawed hardware on my original purchase, and the replacement.

I have been looking at the VR landscape for a couple years now. I have always had the mindset that the technology, while interesting, could never fully immerse me. Not that I didn't want to give it a fair shake, but because my mentality of skepticism is that there is no way I can get totally immersed when I know that I have a bulky headset on my face and I am standing in my living room.Well, honestly I could not have been more off base. When I first put on the headset, after I setup my two sensors that came with the kit, and the 3rd one I purchased, I was transported into a tech trailer, part of the Oculus Tutorial getting you used to the controls. I felt like I was in another place. In playing through this, as well as other games, I truly forgot that there was something on my head. The controllers truly felt as an extension of my hands, whomever designed these is a damn genius.The sensory experience was so realistic, that as I was walking my avatar in game, I felt as if I was going to fall down. Like, my brain was so convinced my eyes were giving it correct information that it wanted to make my legs move or something, I have no idea.Long story short, the technology is incredible. I am a gamer in my late 30s, and I have every console known to man, as well as a beefy gaming PC, and it is now a personal mission of mine to get friends and people I know that love video games to give the rift a try. It is an absolute blast.Well worth the purchase. Where will VR be in 5 years, this is all fascinating.

I'd probably give this a 4 star without the bonus USB repeated cable. These sensors are okay. As a replacement, this would be no problem but I'm using it for the 3-sensor roomscale setup and I've had such a difficult time (and I've read this on forums) with getting all 3 sensors to properly work during the setup procedure. If you manage to finally get past that, it's fine. Not sure if it's the sensor itself or software, but it's ridiculously stupid. If you're looking at buying a sensor, you get a free cable with this and if you have an Oculus, it's not like you have an option to buy some other sensor.Anyways, the base is detachable which is nice. I bought a 3D printed wall mount which I used the detached part of the sensor to cover my rear for roomscale. Stock cable size is decent and the bonus cable size is generous.

The control and feel of the touch controllers are superb. Highly recommend a third rift sensor to avoid loss in tracking, especially when playing games like bullet train. Make sure the capacitive touch sensors register because I had to go through two defective items before finally receiving a functional pair. When I received the first shipment one controller would not allow me to do the finger point gesture. Ordered for a replacement but, it ended up being defective too because hand gesture was locked at thumb rest, when lifting my thumb. So, it failed to do the thumbs-up gesture.Sent it back a second time for a third replacement and everything within the touch controllers now register perfectly. To those who are considering the touch controllers, make sure the sensors work.

Absolutely amazing and I’ve only tried the games that come with it for free.  Robo recall and dead something...western shooter...It feels real once you get into it.  You completely forget time and location.  I’d almost say it is like light exercising if you duck and move to avoid getting hit or to punch or throw.  I was a little out of breath.  You can catch bullets out of the air and throw them back in roborecall.  I bought an extra sensor but it works perfectly with 2 that come in the bundle.  imagine a horde or robots attacking you from 360 degrees.  You can grab them, rip them apart and throw them at the bad guys. Setup required some updates and a reboot to get it to recognize sensors after a email exchange (24 hours) with support.  If you have the money it is completely worth it to have your own VR.  I know I am late to the game but I am now considering changing professions and work in this technology.  Buy it.

Bought it for room scale. Works great and came with an extension cable. What's not to like?Setting up room scale with the Rift can be a bit fiddly but the software shows you which sensor to move or rotate if needed. You also need to make sure you have the USB bandwidth to accommodate the third sensor. This should be a USB 2 port as putting a third sensor on a USB 3 port is too much for a single USB 3 controller. The difference being that the sensor sends raw data to the PC when plugged into USB 3 and compressed data when using USB 2. In practical use for me the room scale tracking seems to work very well in the approximately 12x10 foot area I have defined with 2 sensors on USB 3 and one on USB 2.

I've spent almost 200 hours in VR using this headset, and I plan to spend many more. Rift is an experience like none other, and is well worth the price of $400 IF your PC can run it. I started out using only a Ryzen 3 1200, and I had serious performance issues. I upgraded to a Ryzen 7 1700 and all my problems disappeared.The headset display is clear and screendoor effect is hardly noticeable. If you get sweaty, your lenses MAY fog up a little, but that's to be expected. When that happens, put your headset down, dry your face, and keep playing in a few more minutes.The controllers are incredibly comfortable and you hardly notice them after a few hours of playing. They feel very natural.If you are interested in VR at all and have the equipment to run it, GET THIS HEADSET! You won't regret it!

Tell you what, folks don't know how cool VR is until they try it, no matter what they say. I was a skeptic 'cause of how trendy the concept suddenly became in yuppie circles, but then my buddy got one and now I'm a big believer. Anyway.Get your uncles and aunts and parents to try it while everybody watches the computer screen and heckles. That's my new favorite family game. Anybody can drop right in and enjoy this stuff. I recommend getting Office Simulator right away through Steam; it's a super-casual first-encounter type experience, and it's got heaps of fun stuff to do.Eventually, when you've gotten used to it, get some of the big titles running - Robo Recall is like a full-body arcadesplosion, and you'll get legitimately winded with the physical exertion of dodging and jumping around like an idiot with a bucket on your head. And it's free with the headset. Highly recommend.Never buy a console again; if you've got a decent computer, just get this bad boy.

Overall, the Oculus Rift has been a pleasure using. I love how many games are available and the sense I'm really in another place. The Touch controllers are very nice and the two added cameras really do give a great experience in tracking and moving.My only complaints are the screen resolution and the placement of the screen. If I don't wear my places, everything is very blurry. Even when I do wear my glasses, things aren't as crystal clear looking like with the Gear VR.While it is also immersive, this can reduce a bit by the under nose cut. I am able to see a bit of light (even strapping it tighter) and if I look down I can see the floor just a bit.These things shouldn't discourage you from the overall experience. The Tiltbrush app alone is enough to buy this (it's truly an amazing 3D art app). Everything is fluid and you won't find such immersive apps that give you hours of entertainment anywhere else. The price is truly unbeatable for getting into the VR experience. It's really like another computer system, just on your head.

This just adds to the room-scale VR that I tend to favor. Helps for the one direction that seems to be the one that I can't face.This sensor might not be necessary if you face the two sensors you already have, facing each other across from each other from the center of the room.The only problem I have had is how the Oculus recommends where to put it. It wants me to put it right behind me but since I can't, I have to just ignore the warning it gives me. Nothing wrong with that anyways, I just don't know for sure if my area of the room is totally optimal or not for room-scale VR games.

For early adoption mainstream VR I am very pleased with the build quality and overall experience of the Rift. At $400 with free games if you have a graphics card that can run one (I used GTX 1080), you wont be disappointed. While the library of games is still missing the system seller, there are a lot of good experiences to be had. The biggest gripe is going to be screen resolution and the subsequent ""screen-door"" effect, but given that graphics cards are still a ways out from easily being able to support dual 4k+ screens at 90hz+ this is a worthy early console, sort of like the PsOne was for 3D graphics (sans the great game library) it sold me that VR will change gaming eventually.

I purchased the Oculus Rift before Touch was available. Using the Rift with either the Xbox controller or the little remote got very boring quickly. After buying the Touch controllers, my love of the Rift has returned. Being able to see your hands in VR is really what makes VR. There are several games that support the Touch controller and are a blast to play. Robo Recall comes free with Touch and that game is amazing; it's exactly what VR is all about.

I held back on buying one for a long time, but decided to go for it in order to escape the reality of 2018.It was very easy to set up.  I had run the Oculus compatibility program and had identified that my USB ports were not compatible, so I bought a separate card.  Plugging in and setting up the cameras was very easy.  I was up and running within half an hour.  The packaging and unboxing experience felt like a well thought out product, rather than just another PC accessory.The experience is great.  I had a Samsung VR Gear and thought it would be the same based on the screen resolution, but the full Oculus is a much better experience.  A PC produces much better graphics and that comes across in the games and experiences available.  It's not absolutely sharp and clear resolution, but in a fast moving game, you don't notice it.  What comes across is the feeling of space and being there.  The objects you interact with have a sense of presence that makes the experience unique.  Two titles that stand out for me are Robo Recall and Space Pirate Trainer.  Using the headset for more than 30 minutes did not give my neck a strain, nor was it uncomfortable both in terms of wear and vision.The headset itself feels well made.  The headphones are clear and do not distort at higher volumes (I had set the headset at 70% and it was too loud for me).  The touch controllers are comfortable and feel intuitive.  I'd like to be able to use them for all my non-VR games if I could.Unlike the Samsung Gear VR, you can adjust the lenses to take into account the distance between your eyes.  This gave me a much sharper image than the Gear.  If you wear glasses, though, you're probably going to have a problem.  There's very little space for those (I have seen workarounds online).  There is no focus setting, which the Gear VR has, so you can't take off your glasses and adjust.The Oculus Store and Steam VR seem to have a decent number of games.  Not sure if content will keep on coming, but what's available right now is entertaining enough.I'd like to add that I've used the Vive at a demo station and I find both VR experiences and visuals to be about the same.  I'd have considered the Vive if it was around the same price and its sensors were easy to set up.

My kids liked the VR arcade at the mall a bit too much. It made sense to purchase a quality VR set.  I did extensive research  into VR sets before selecting this one. The main reason I selected it is because it’s an all in one set. Many of the other VR sets require add-ons to function properly.  Only thing I added was a third sensor. All the reviews I read said it works best with three sensors. So I simply skipped the delay and bought three sensors. It’s very easy to set up. I was very intimidated but it worked fine.  You can buy mounts for the wall to make it best for you. As you can see I chose to wedge the sensors between and on top of household items.

I went with the Oculus over the Vive because the Oculus has access to the Oculus store and Steam VR, where the Vive can only play Steam VR games.  That's all good, except they don't tell you... The controls are terrible in Steam.  Throwing and other quick actions are just not tracked well right now.  It's a known issue, check out the Reddit.The controllers are also not as user friendly as the Vive.  Vive controllers feel more natural because of their weight and length.  Button position is not nearly as convenient on the Oculus. It's a little nitpicky, but for the price...I get to be.Also avoid the over priced Oculus sensor mounts. Tape em on a wall or mount a shelf.

Apparently it's a problem for a majority of Oculus Rift headsets.The experience is still so cool that I won't return it, and I'll work through the hassle however, Oculus should fix connectivity issues.

Swapping out display-port adapters, hooking direct to hdmi, different cables,etc etc. No matter still couldn't get the headset to work. Also, the room space had to be smaller than I preferred, for the 3 sensors to lock in (bought the extra one). I guess many had much luck with the Oculus, I was not one.

The technology is a little young yet.  Had trouble getting it running and spent a while getting the right connectors and adapters.  Had to work around issues with getting my graphics card to send a signal out of both HDMI ports at once (workaround was to use an adapter to use 1 HDMI and 1 DVI port).  Required a re-install of the software (as a last ditch attempt to get the device to show a picture) after all of the port corrections / adapters were connected.  Beware - chaining HDMIs may run you into issues as the HDMI port may not have enough power to drive it the longer distance.Spend some time planning your connections (2 x USB 3 and 1 HDMI in addition to your normal computer display) and make sure to run the Oculus compatibility tool before purchasing.Once we worked through the issues on setup then it was pretty cool to play with.  Expect to have some difficulty getting it to work correctly with your individual games (unless you're just using the Oculus store) but Steam and Oculus are coming along a bit faster in this area so it was less problematic than the initial setup.

These really do block outside noise, which increases immersion quite a bit. I use my Oculus almost exclusively for sim racing. General audio fidelity is high. Bass is adequate, I don't really notice a difference from the original headphones, although I do have a Buttkicker mounted to my sim rig which would mask any bass loss. Generally I think this con is overblown.Putting on the headset and taking it off is a little more cumbersome since you have to nestle these in/out of your ears, but it's not a big deal. I do find myself using virtual desktop more as a result, which I now think is a positive change.The only real con for me is that it's kind of gross if you want to share the headset with your friends.

Incredible technology.  I am hooked! Took quite a bit of work but had it up and running on two different, fast computers with high end graphics cards.  Most of the work was updating the Windows computers since I mostly use Mac products. The immersive quality of the product exceeded expectations.  Used the unit on Sansar and it frequently crashed.  When it worked I could see the incredible possibilities.  It will take time to get these VR applications stable.  Apollo 11 is incredible and the games were great.  BUT as I activated a trial of a very large 24 gb game the unit stopped working. The touch controllers disappeared and the headset went dead.I rebooted, looked at my device manager and the headset still was not on or recognized. I tried it on the other computer and it was still dead.  Contacted support and have not heard anything back.  Other reviews show that Oculus will not replace with any new devices. I always feel safe since amazon will take the items back.  I am ordering a new unit and returning the defective one. It has gone down 50 in a week and I am getting the Square trade warranty.  I planned to buy a second unit for gameplay.  I will give it some time to see if the new one lasts.  From others experience it sounds like the extended warranty is worthwhile Many reviews state the units quit frequently.On any technology purchases, Amazon has been the best.  If something is defective out of the box they take it back. Customer service at most technology companies do not understand customer service. Amazon is your ally against them. I do not know how amazon will continue to afford to do this. Time will tell.  I will update after the replacement unit arrives.Update:  Simple fix, The cable at the headset had come unplugged. Interesting that I could not find the fix easily online. Customer support finally responded.  Raised my score. This thing is amazing!

I have a rather old, but beefy server I built on the Xeon platform.  It is dual cpu with 12 cores total and I have 96 gb of ram.  I have two radeon 480 8gb gpus running in Cross Fire mode (both GPUs acting as 1) and the software still tells me my setup doesn't meet Oculus performance reqs.  This wouldn't be a big deal to me all the games and apps started up in spite of that notification.  Luckily, all my favorite ones, like Beat Saber, Table Tennis, and Marvel all start up, but epic roller coaster and others I purchased won't start up.Oh, if you don't have USB 3.0/2.0 available on your box together, make sure to buy the extra cards/extensions necessary to do so, if you want to use extra sensors.  I still have to add a 3.0 port card in to support that.  It works fine without the 360 sensors.  And, you need both 3.0 and 2.0 USB to do 360 degree.  You can only have one sensor plugged into 3.0 at a time, apparently....Another issue I have is that, like other comments, the HDMI cable does not always get recognized and can cause lots of frustration.One last frustration is that, if you have multiple users of different heights, as in our house, you have to go through the whole sensor set up process, including resetting the guardian system, to reset the height for the user.  Poor user experience, in my opinion.It is still SO worth the purchase and frustrations.  The experience is like no other.  I am an adrenaline junkie and love the feeling I get standing on the virtual heights in the games.  One of my favorites is the sample promo for Spider man Homecoming, where you sling up to the top of a crane and swing down from the top.  When I look down to the street below, I get that vertigo feeling I love without the danger of falling to my death.  My other favorite is the space walk outside the ISS.  It is incredible to see the actual sizing of the space station and its parts. It virtually fulfills a dream of mine to walk in space and see the earth from that perspective.

This system works very well with the  Alienware AW17R4-7345SLV-PUS 17"" Laptop (7th Generation Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM, 1TB HDD, Silver) VR Ready with NVIDIA GTX 1070 that I purchased from Amazon also.  I took of one star because I have had problems with the sensors not calibrating correctly and it wants you to configure it standing.  I got the Oculus Rift over the HTV because I wanted a sitting VR experience to start.  I am still working on the configuration and playing with settings.  So far I have gotten it to work but have never gotten a perfect calibration of the sensors which makes it hard to use the controllers that come with it.  I also have not been able to get it to work with steam VR as of yet.

The Rift was so much fun. Right up until it stopped working.I spent a lot of money on this thing, and a ton on extra bells and whistles to really enjoy my VR system, and because of all that money spent, I took extra special care of my headset and controllers. It sits safely on a stand, with no natural light around, and wrapped in thick, black cloth. None of that mattered. On Sunday, I spent my day off in and out of VR. Monday and Tuesday, I did not have time. Today, Wednesday, I decided I wanted to spend a little while with the headset on. Not gonna happen, cause suddenly my left screen doesn't turn on and my right screen is just a bunch of color lines of red and green. I did the checks. Cords, ports, software, GPU software and settings and so on...Luckily I am still within my return window and will be doing so, if the headset will not be replaced.

Its a great VR headset IF your computer is built right and you don’t need glasses or contacts. My significant other and I bought this after designing out own computer to exceed its desired specs and it works phenomenally. However, while he can play it for hours at a time I can only play for so long before the blurriness gets to me. I just can’t seem to adjust it to match my glasses. That being said it is alsp poorly responsive in games like tiltbrush if you only have the two sensors that come with it. It’s recommended that you buy either a third or fourth for the best experience. But dropping another $60 per sensor isn’t everyone’s ideal time.Ultimately its a great sensor just not astigmatism friendly.

OH man where to start, This headset so far has totally changed how I look at gaming and PC home entertainment. I have usd both the Vive and now this headset and I will admit that the vives tracking is a bit better at stock but for the most part it is almost the same and the controlers are bar none better on the rift than any other headset you can buy for the next year at least until the knuckles release. The resolution of the screen is fine and I dont see the screen door effect unless the image is a solid color like black loading screens so that is not an issue unless you really try to look for it. For its base price at 399.00 USD I cant find a reason to not grab this over the other options out there. The vive and vive pro are simply way too expensive for what you get as of right now seeing as you can buy a rift with a 3rd sensor and result in the same tracking and room scale as a vive and save 120 ish $ in the processs. The set up was really easy, idk why some people have said its hard. You plug everything into the USBs and the HDMI in and run the oculus set up app and it just kinda does it all for you. The ""hardest"" part is moving the sensor cameras around a bit till it says hey that is a good spot for good tracking and you move on. Took me anout 15 min from unboxing to logging into VRChat. This, unlike the vive comes with everything at stock and does not try to throw anything at you as addons later down the road such as the head phones being built in and the controlers being stock over the wands. Vive will be selling the pro soon and the kuckles shortly after as seperate items to buy at VERY high costs that simply turn me off to that platform completely. This headset is also far more comfortable and does not plug my nose or cut into my face frrom the pressure like other headsets do. The controlers are so damn nice to use they feel so natural and fit the hand so well. My GF and I have both main systems for VR, Vive for the top end best of the best at the expense of being way too much $, and now the Rift for being comfortable and easy. We both agree that the Rift is better as a user. She actually almost sold her vive for the Rift but I convinced her to just keep it for the new addons coming later. If you are on the fence about this I say pick this headset hands down. Esp of you can get a good deal or rebate on it or use the amazon trade in to save some money it becomes such an amazing value. I traded in my xim4 PS4 Kb/m converter, since i sold my PS4, and it cut 80 bucks off the cost of this headset making it 310$ USD which imo made this hands down the best value headset you can get period.

Easy to install, full VR with roomscale. With 2 cameras that come with it I get nearly perfect tracking up to ~300 degrees around me. It won't work if I'm facing straight behind the cameras - I suspect I'll need to buy the 3rd sensor for that. I think the 3rd sensor is definitely worth it for more intense games like Robo Recall where you're literally running around and dodging for your life. But for casual games not really needed. The touch controllers are extremely comfortable and feel natural to use.Also, the touch controllers are virtually indestructible. This is sort of a bad thing, because literally punch a hole through your wall.I was also able to get steam VR up and running with minimal difficulty, so I get the best of both the Oculus store and steam. Really glad I ended up choosing this over Vive. Not saying Vive was bad when I tried it - but they are basically very similar to each other, except that Oculus is half the price and gives a higher quality feel over the Vive...win win.

Bought for my son's birthday. He has been using for over a month and he loves it. He paired it with an Nvidia 960 graphics card and it works great. I can only imagine how much better it would be with a high end card. What I personally like the most is how committed Occulus seems to be in making their headset a mainstream computer peripheral. Once you enter this VR world you immediately notice how far they have come in the last year. The company had a major software glitch recently and they were on top of it in a flash, apologizing everywhere. My son was not even aware of it, but they reached out to him. My son got $15 towards a game he really wanted, all for a little down time he suffered through. Now that Occulus is owned by a major company I feared that they may disappear or lose their drive to be the best. My fears have been put to rest.

My husband purchased the Oculus and Beat Saber for me earlier this year. Since I’ve been playing, I haven’t gone back to console gaming. VR is way too much fun! It’s been a great way for my teenage son and I to spend some quality time together and compete on expert levels. It’s also great cardio! I had the in-laws try it out too recently and they were hooked! They really enjoyed Robo Recall.My husband and I took my son and his friend to a VR Arcade with the HTC Vives. We definitely prefer the Oculus. The controllers are lightweight and ergonomic, and the headset isn’t big and bulky like the Vive. The vives also had a gym locker smell, and it didn’t matter how many sanitary wipes were used on them.We also got a little frustrated with the tracking and freezing on the Vives. I’m not sure if it was due to the sensors being mounted above, or the computers, or if it was the vives. We still had fun at the arcade but we are thankful to have the Oculus, it’s been 6 months with zero issues.

This thing is insanely awesome and is probably the best gaming peripheral I've ever bought! I started out in VR with the Samsung Gear VR so I had expected the Oculus Rift to be a bit of a step up in terms of quality of the games and overall fidelity. Once I tried the Oculus Rift, I was completely blown away. Not only it is leagues and leagues more immersive and clear, but the games themselves are at a whole other level.The main takeaway for people is do not overlook the Oculus Touch hand controllers that come included in this package as a gimmick. In my opinion they are more fun than the headset itself! They are crazy accurate even down to finger position! Being able to wave, picking things up, shoot gun, pull back bows, and throw objects is just astounding.Don't forget you also get 4 free games in this bundle. Please try Robo Recall!!! It is a masterpiece in terms of how they geared every little detail of the game for VR.This is an amazing package and is well worth the money in my opinion. It is both fun and it gets you on your feet and physically moving around. Don't be surprised if you work up a sweat in certain games, you will move that much.

I have used the Oculus Rift way back when all you could use as an input was an Xbox controller or the simple Oculus remote. It was still a very impressive experience-- with stereoscopic 3D to really make you feel like you're there, and built in stereo speakers to add to the ambience-- but something was truly lacking. And what it was lacking is the Oculus Touch. Without it, the Oculus was just a gimmick; it was just a glorified way of controlling the camera with your head/viewpoint. And only interacting with the virtual world with a traditional controller just felt like a shallow experience. But the Oculus Touch does such a stellar job at giving the impression of hand presence. It's an incredible piece of hardware: intelligent placing of buttons to give the impression of grasping an object and to fit the shape of the hand superbly, fantastic motion tracking, vibration feedback, and touch sensors, so the controller has input based on the positioning of your hands, and not just the buttons themselves. It's a must-have to get the most out of the VR experience.

We decided to put this headset on our wedding registry and I'm SO glad we did. It's hard to describe how awesome VR and this headset are without having someone try it themselves. Every friend and family member I've told about says ""Oh, that sounds pretty cool."" Then when they come over and actually try it, they are blown away and want to play the entire time they're visiting (including the non-gamers like our parents).We did end up buying an extra sensor for the best possible tracking (we didn't try it without the extra sensor so I can't say how much it helped), and a leather face pad to replace the stock foam one because the included one gets sweaty and seemed unsanitary when we have people over.The included games were honestly an after-thought but I figured I'd try Robo Recall just for the heck of it and that game is AWESOME. We've found so many great games that anyone who comes to try it out can find something they like (it's also a pretty safe bet that anyone will like Beat Saber).It is expensive but, to me, it's totally worth the price. There was minimal frustration with the initial set-up (we weren't able to connect one of the Touch devices right away but it worked out), and once we set it up we've had no problems with having to reboot or adjust anything.

If you're on the fence about getting a VR system, look no further. The price is very cheap now and it really immerses you into the game. Is freaking fantastic for flight syms, tanks syms, and just about anything else you want to play. Being in aviation, I can tell you how realistic it looks. Obviously they can't help you with the G-forces, but the visual effects are top notch. Back in the 90's I drove tanks for the Army.

They are very well made.  The headsets are solid and lite. The hand controllers are comfortable and easy to get use to.

I have been wanting an Oculus ever since before it came out and I finally bought one after building my computer for it. A lot better than I thought, looked up issues like: god rays, FOV, sensors, screen door effect, etc. I've come to the conclusion that I basically forgot about all that once I put the head set on. It was my first time ever playing on a VR and was nervous about spending $400+ on something I've never tried before. Thankfully no regrets.

Likes: it’s easy to use and set up. Long cables, the touch controllers are amazing and use only a single AA battery in each.Dislikes: not the most comfortable. If you are a glasses wearer then you will need to purchase an extra attachment to add more space in the goggles. You get a lot of lens flare do to the screen and the glass angle something that is much better with the S model. You must connect to the HDMI port that is directly connected to the GPU, and be sure to run the oculus compatibly test. With laptops contact the manufacturer to see if it can play oculus rift. Some laptops that read VR ready and have specs that can run it well doesn’t count oculus (HP Omen). Some compatibility issues with steam and the oculus store can occur as well.

The touch controllers, absolutely amazing, great feel. The headset, fits but the pixel fade is delayed, you can see a pretty noticable blur that is somewhat distracting. The default face isnt comfortable and soaks up sweat so you will want an aftermarket face rest... it also loses tracking often, and struggles to keep up with fast paced gameplay. If you are in the market for this, you probably already understand the setup required to get it working outside the oculus home for steam, but if you aren’t aware please do your research. It isn’t a bad product, but I recommend the vive over this, spend a few hundred dollars more to get the most out of your money.

I'd also see clips of people playing on Twitch, and just watching it made me dizzy.  Between the two, I thought I knew what VR was.Then I experienced it.Just like the invention of television, pioneers tried to advertise TV on the radio but no one understood it.  Modern VR has the same problem in that you can't understand what it is until you experience it.  Worse still, people tried the ""put your phone in this plastic box"" and thought they knew what VR was, and have already made up their minds that it is a terrible gimmick.Find someone who has a Rift and try it.

At first I loved the thing, but then I saw some flaws, and I am now deciding to return it for the Vive. It's OK, but it needs improvement. The tracking sucks, unless you want to fork over another $60-$120 for more sensors, then you are almost at the Vive. Also, more games are set up for the vive rather than the oculus, I have played a fair share of vr games from steam on my oculus, and some games that have vive controllers, and say they are meant for both, run poorly on my oculus.

I was blown away by VR when I first tried it.  The immersion is well executed with the rift.  I still enjoy playing VR whenever I can.  This thing changes the way video games are presented in a fundamental way.  Of course, the games that are out there for this thing vary from terrible to amazing but the immersion factor is generally always flawless on the rift.I guess one could criticize the fact you are anchored by a cord, however I wouldn't feel very safe if I had to be walking far with a blindfold on like this thing.  most games only require you lean or duck, step once or twice.Yep, you need a powerful computer to use this.  it's a well known barrier to VR.  you should also make sure you have a decent sized area to play without breakable objects near youThe setup took a bit of trial and error getting the sensors positioned right, but otherwise was easy enough

Absolutely amazing addition to the Oculus Rift. If you have one, you need these. I liked my Rift a lot before but once you get these in your hands, it's such an incredible experience. To have your hands be displayed so accurately in game and to actually interact with these environments is such a difference compared to using a traditional gamepad. I highly recommend Superhot VR, you'll feel like a movie star and you can have someone, who has never used VR before, hop in with ease and be blown away. The few people who tried it out at my house over various holidays parties won't stop talking about it/inviting themselves over. They fit in your hands amazingly and are so intuitive, especially compared to traditional controllers.While these downsides are not enough to lose a star, I will mention a few things that they lack, especially in comparison to other products like the Vive's motion controllers. First of all, these come with a single sensor to add to the one you already have for the Rift. Unlike the Vive however, both sensors are still designed to go in front of you, meaning no 360 degree coverage. While you rarely will have an issue with the Touch controllers being recognized in Oculus games since they are designed to be forward facing, 180 degree games, there are amazing games like Onward in Steam VR, that are designed to be roomscale experiences. As soon as something gets in between the sensors and the Touch controllers, like your body or arms, your hands will suddenly drift or stop moving. FYI, this is called ""occlusion"".I've gotten a third sensor directly from Oculus and use this one behind me in my setup to achieve roomscale. It's almost perfect coverage but when I face the one corner that I don't have a sensor in now, my controllers can get blocked by my arms or body and thats noticeable in games like Onward when you're holding a gun up. I've played the game on Vive before and I did not have these issues as much. Vive only uses two sensors as well so from a technological aspect, it's certainly possible for improvement from Oculus in this aspect. I should emphasize however, this is a rare issue and only occurs when I'm playing games and I face in one particular direction. Also, the Vive's lighthouse system was not perfect in my limited experience either so they both have some definite improvements they could use.As I said, this is all nitpicky and doesn't happen all the time or even in most games. The controllers are certainly a must buy if you already have the Rift.

Been using this since March 2018 and it's been absolutely fantastic so far. I've dropped the headset plenty of times by accident from about 2 feet and I've seen no damage.  Base headset is very comfortable and I can barely feel weight of the earphones. Batteries in controllers last about a week if you use it daily for 6-8 hours. One problem is that one of my sensors wasn't able to update firmware after about 5 months so it made it useless (oculus requires all equipment to be up to date). I was able to get a refurbished replacement after emailing Oculus but they never gave an answer as to why my original sensor stopped functioning.

The rift was definitely an interesting purchase. The packaging that it came in reminded me when I got my first iPhone... Like WOW whatever I am opening in this box must be high quality. Being inside the rift is pretty crazy for the first couple hours. It's funny to watch my friends freak out when they put it on. HOWEVER, I wear glasses and have contacts and was hoping I could fit my glasses in there.... No you can't or at least for me they pinched my nose and were extremely uncomfortable. If I were you I would wait on purchasing VR until more games are out and the resolution gets higher.. especially when it  doesn't cost $800 (HTC Vive Pro).

It's best to hook them up, set up your room & sensors then let the thing update for a few hours depending on your internet and PC speeds. If you can afford a third & fourth sensor and a couple USB extension cable you will have limitless fun. Stay away from free games, most of them just suck.

Definitely weak on bass as other reviewers have stated, which is why I only rated them 4 stars.  However, I use Oculus primarily for exercise and I sweat buckets - making the native headphones not optimal (they just get too gross and sweaty).  I had been using other Bluetooth headphones, but that adds an extra step to setup and sometimes can be a pain when having to switch between sound inputs.  These Oculus earbuds are the BEST solution to the above and sound good enough to not be too much of a detriment overall.  The other benefit is they definitely offer more ambient sound dampening.

Love it. Tried both the rift and the vive, and kept the rift, Its amazing, and just feels more immersive than the vive visually. It's more comfortable imo, and the touch controllers are just worlds better than vive wands. I am playing Skyrim VR currently and I will never go back to flat screen gaming if a title if offered in VR. I have owned Skyrim for a very long time, and always got bored a few hours into a playthrough. But in VR its hard to stop playing. My feet hurt far before I get bored. VR just changes the way I feel about interaction and exploring. Its amazing, and worth trying if you are on the fence like I was.

In terms of gaming, you really aren't missing much if you skip VR for now.  Standard gaming obviously has many more options and honestly they are of better quality in pretty much every department.  The immersion factor from VR is negated by the fact that you will most likely be doing shorter gaming sessions.  I have also yet to find an RPG of comparable value to non-vr titles.  Sure, you can get fallout 4 or Skyrim but they aren't more immersive in VR.I would go to a VR arcade and try out the system a few times before  purchasing.  On another note, you will have to buy a 3rd sensor for the motion tracking to be spot on.

While it is cool technology, it has significant drawbacks.The game selection is limited, there was not really a ‘killer’ game that kept my kids (9,11 and 13) coming back more than a day or two. It does not hold up to normal wear and tear, a fact made more onerous because it requires such a high-end computer setup. Starting from scratch you need to spend 1,500-2000 dollars (only 400-500 to oculus), but the headset lasted us only a little more over a year. There is no option to repair with Oculus past warranty, only re-buy. Now that we are faced with needing to buy another headset I am probably going to either forgoe VR until a more committed company gets in the market or improves their products.

Best buy ever but is not only that. Played lone echo game on this and I am overwhelmed with the experience. I was expecting an amazing way of interaction but the feeling was more of being in a new dimension and be part of that. You do not know what I am talking about until you live the experience, allways dreamed of being an astronaut, today I think is not worth the effort having this technology. I think the touch controllers are more important than expected because were an extension of my body in that dimension mainly for interact with that world. If you were happy with kinect, maybe vive is your option, for me being seated in a couch for a lot of time makes more sense than being standing and moving few minutes and because of that you do not need a third sensor. I am afraid to say, this is just starting to happen, how will it be in a few more years....this is not cheap, despite that I am considering one for the bedroom. I have some concerns about let my younger childrens use not because of physical implications but for the psychological.

The Oculus Rift is an amazing product. However, there is a good chance you are trying to decide between and Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.Pros.Lightweight minimalistic designControllers are better for a VR experience the Vive(in my opinion) and I speak from experience. I've had a lot of experience with both.ConsCurrently there is no way to replace the head strap. The factory one gets the job done but isn't that comfortable.Are very few accessories available on the market right now and it doesn't look like there are any coming anytime real soon.If you are interested in getting a wireless adapter the tpcast will cost you about $50 more for the Oculus than it will for the Vive.RecommendationsSpend the money and get a third sensorMake sure you have at least 16 gigabytes of RAM

If any of you want to add me on oculus I go by kimiki There is even a VR MMO called orbus that is amazing!!Onto the headset itself i only have one issue with it, and it's not as much of an issue, it's more like i need to be a slight bit more gentle on it. the strap on the right side tends to feel a bit weird, like it's not tightening the headset like it should be..IF YOU WEAR GLASSES LIKE I DO: there is a site you can order an overlay lens for your oculus so you won't have to wear your glasses!!TL;DR so worth it, i had the OSVR and i literally grabbed the OSVR and threw it in the trash

So awesome! Expensive, but it is great fun. Set up was slightly challenging as I thought the instructions could have been more clear. Now that it's set up, though, I have been having a grand time. The controls are intuitive, the headset is mostly comfortable although those who wear glasses will find it more awkward. There are some really great games for free that will provide many hours of fun. Check out Herobound and Farlands as well as The Lab. Google Earth is another freebie that is worth checking out. Oculus has a nice app that will check out your computer to confirm it's capabilities/compatibilities with the Rift.

It's one thing to play a game, it's another thing to become part of the game, which is really cool.The ergonomics of the controllers are pretty decent and feel like you have hands to interact with in the world of VR... I'd like to see controllers eventually evolve into gloves or something along those lines since that would be more natural. These controllers work for now until tech, prices, etc evolved.The resolution is mediocre, but ironically while things aren't the sharpest, you very much feel like you are there and the sense of depth and engagement is really cool.If you haven't experienced VR before, I'd recommend looking at it, even if just to do a demo. It's definitely one of those life goals worth experiencing :-P

I just got done using it for the first time, and well. I was expecting it to be far better than the Gear VR I use with my S8+, They are about the same picture wise, in my view. What Rift has going for it, is content and it doesn't heat up like the Gear VR/Phone. I may change some of my feeling for it the more I use it, maybe. I wouldn't get this until you check out the display models at a Store that sells them and your computer meets it's usage specs. My video card meets the min, so some of my picture display may be because of that. But, you know, as a whole it's fun.

The Oculus is amazing by itself, but with the Touch it is amazing.  I have had my Oculus for several months prior to getting the Touch.  In that time I drifted away from using quickly without a proper input solution it was lacking.  The Touch puts it over the top.Setup was easy and quick.The only negative I have is where do I put the cameras.  Space is a premium for me.  As I am sure it is for many.

I have enjoyed my experiences in VR since purchasing the Oculus Rift.  It is definitely still a bit of an infant technology, with most games and applications being little more than tech. demos that showcase the potential of VR, but those tech. demo experiences are insanely immersive.  I was far more impressed with the experience than I expected to be.All that being said, I seem to have a rather wide head and I wear glasses.  This presented some difficulties for me as most of my glasses simply do not fit inside the headset.  Unfortunately my vision is poor enough that not using corrective lenses is simply not an option for me.  I have a pair of glasses that are somewhat more narrow than others, but they barely fit inside the headset and I don't find the experience particularly comfortable, especially since these narrow frames already tend to ride a bit tight on my face.  When removing the headset, the glasses are lodged inside and come off with it.  This also presents the possibility of the glasses scratching the rather sensitive lenses inside the headset, which is always a concern when dislodging them from the headset.Moving on, the setup was fairly simple even though I did have to purchase a USB 3.0 PCIe card and a DVI-to-HDMI adapter to satisfy the required number of ports on my PC and allow me to leave my monitor plugged in.I do not have a lot of room, and I live in the upstairs of a very oddly shaped house (geodesic dome) so I have sloped, angular walls.  Despite this I was able to clear a small space of about 6x6 for use with the headset, but I do have to be very cautious of my boundaries so as not to hit my head and hands into the walls.  I do recommend clearing a larger space for use with this system.  Many of the experiences just can't be played in such a small area, such as the Rick and Morty VR game, which can be disappointing when you find one that you'd like to try but don't have the room for it.  Also be wary that wherever you are using this, the cable will be tethered to a device on your head and your, rather expensive if it's capable of running this device, PC.  Do not use in a high traffic area and sequester your pets and children before use.The Touch controllers are rather impressive, tracking hand motion accurately and even detecting when individual fingers are lifted off of them or gripped around them.  I found these to be one of the most impressive parts of the entire package.Overall I HIGHLY recommend experiencing VR to anyone and everyone.  Though it is still a new technology, the potential for some of the most amazing experiences you've ever had in the comfort of your home is through the roof.  In the coming years, this technology will only get better.  Imagine lighter, wireless headsets, with higher resolution displays, with adjustable corrective lenses built into the unit (one of the competitors offers this, but it does not support my prescription strength and is a unit for true hardcore techies- not for the newbie).The support for users with corrective lenses is insufficient, which is the only reason I knocked off a star, but if you've got good eyesight and/or contacts/laser corrected vision, you definitely want one of these.

One of the controllers that came with my Rift was dead, so Amazon sent me another pair. I was pretty impressed by that, and it's just another reason to be a loyal Amazon customer. Oculus would have made me send it in then wait and wait for it to be fixed and who wants to do that when they just got a shiny new toy?! So Amazon was great.The controllers are incredible. Not only do they know when and were you are touching them, they know when you aren't as well. These things are quite intuitive, and it only takes a minute to figure out how to use them. There is a lot going on when you're in VR, you're getting a lot of data moving very quickly and having to fumble with the controllers would really break the coveted 'immersion'. These things deliver, I have zero complaints about them. They are brilliant.The only suggestion I might make would be to make them rechargeable, but that's really not a huge deal. I use rechargeable batteries in them anyway, and properly charged bats will last about a month. So it's really not a big deal.I strongly recommend using the wrist straps! If you don't, you have a 100% chance of eventually throwing your brand new, technologically advanced controller across the room. So just use the strap, lol

This came in this fancy box and all polished even though after a week of wall punching it looked more like my chins after a scooter whiped around and hit them. After the initial wow moment wore off I had a moment of buyers remorse until I bought Onward and Pavlov, both amazing games. While it should come with three sensors (2 for 360 degree and one on the floor so I can drop to the floor when I'm getting shot at) its fine if you get a combo of third sensor and USB extender. The overall look of it can bother some people, it does have god rays (whites really pop) and it does have the screen door effect. In the oculus software they make it really hard to boost the resolution above around 1500 and when in SteamVR you can scale up the resolution to almost 4K for both eyes. The screen door effect is then gone but the god rays only have 1 solution which is anti fog but they are still there even with that. The screen door effect is mainly caused by this being not meant for 2000$ systems and trying to get VR to the main stream so they made it optimized, so if you have a good enough PC go for 4K super scale. The tracking is worse then the vive but it is still amazing. The games are pretty great except for the fact that the singleplayer games are really short but multiplayer will get a ton of time from me. Everything flows and even with my 970 I feel like I have a equal experience to a Titan X. I have had a great time with my oculus and plan to keep using it on the regular.

I already had the two sensors that are included with the Rift and Touch controllers, which work well, but you really need the third sensor to get a great setup for room scale. The third sensor takes care of any blind spots and lets you move around very easily within your space for the newer room scale games that are coming out (which there are more and more of lately).

The Rift is great. I didn't have any trouble with set up on the computer, but I did have to buy more ports because of the number of devices that need to be plugged in (PCI-E to Type C and Type A USB).

Its an Oculus sensor. It works with the Oculus rift (No, it does not work with Oculus Quest or Oculus Rift-S). They provided an extra long USB 2.0 extension cable with the package. Note that will make it impossible for USB 3.0 so if you want or desire a higher speed tracking get your own USB 3.0 extension cable. Despite it being USB 2.0 I do not have tracking issues, however I'd recommend getting a 4th sensor for the opposite corner of your room, or configure the sensors in a Y pattern for full back coverage and go against the recommended L pattern Oculus recommends in the setup.

Its to a point where you begin to lose yourself in the game and start to fully think you exist in this simulated reality.  There are a lot of fun silly games, but the aviation simulator game we have actually made me nauseous it was so intense.So, great product and I would recommend it, but we did need to buy a third sensor so we can experience the full effects games offer, given two sensors just aren't able to be positioned to pick up all of your movements.

Have had the Rift for a month. I spent the first couple of days playing through the intro stuff & free stuff like Robo Recall, Quill, Lost, The Lab etc all of which were very cool. I played through a lot of stuff although cool, very limited in replayability but I was saving best for last and let me tell you, for me, Skyrim although not a VR native game is worth the headset alone. I have been hooked all over again on Skyrim and although still the same game it feels completely different. The other game that I found to have a lot of bang for the buck is Beat Saber. These games alone are worth the Rift. The icing on the top though is playing SBS Blu Ray 3D files in the headset. Using SKYBOXVR, I can just lay on my back and watch 3D films and it's like watching a film in the movie theater but way more comfortable. Most of the games have sales and the asking prices are not too much. I hope more people buy in because VR is a whole other level of entertainment and it seems to be struggling to get developers, filmmakers & artists on board which is a real shame. The only people really pushing the envelope are Oculus Studios themselves with games like Lone Echo.

Its definitely a good experience to start off with, but it does not have full body tracking, and the kinect mod is not worth it since it takes 4 of them, and has issues. The vive has the best full body tracking with the individual trackers, but those alone will cost you $300. The reason I enjoy the rift more than the vive right now is the comfort level, the controllers, and the fact that it came with a headset. The vive headset comes seperate and costs $100. For the full vive setup, its $600 for normal tracking with the headset, and its $500+300+100 ($900) if you want full body tracking and the headset. Oculus costs $350+$60 ($410) with a 3 sensor setup for normal tracking, but again has no full body tracking. The vive controllers suck, so until the knuckles come out, i would not recommend it.

This thing is wonderful. Just make sure you have a lot of space and if at all possible try it out before you buy it, and try a number of different games with different ""comfort levels"" and locomotion styles. This is so you can guage how succeptible you are to motion sickness. If it turns out you get motion sick easily you will be very limited in game selection and your rift may end up being a paperweight.At first the image will seem blurry compared to looking at a monitor and pixels will be apparent (often referred to as the screen door effect), but once you get engaged in playing a game that all fades away and it becomes incredibly immersive.If you are trying to decide between this and the Vive, here are the key factors that won me over:The controllers are just excellent. Very well designed and comfortable. The vive wands really don't appeal to me.Oculus has a number of games which cannot be played on Vive because the vive wands have fewer inputs than the oculus touch controllers. Meanwhile most vive games can be played on oculus (the ones that can't are mostly because vive has a larger maximum playspace, I can barely make room for my oculus as it is though).The oculus headset is lighter and less bulky than the vive headset.Oculus bundle is 100 bucks cheaper! But you need to get a third sensor for 360 degree room-scale with the oculus so it's not that much cheaper.Here are some games I've tried myself that I would highly recommend, depending on your comfort level:Lone Echo, Beat Saber, Elite Dangerous (HOTAS recommended), job simulator, robo recall, brass tactics, superhotOne more thing, I had a lot of trouble setting up my sensors for 360 degree room scale play because the setup wizard doesn't give a very good explanation. So here's a tip to help you out: your three sensors should be arranged in a right triangle, so that the front two sensors are to the right and left of the display in the diagram and your third sensor is straight back from either the right or left sensor. Oh also, I had trouble with the oculus software detecting all of my sensors and the headset properly. What worked for me was plugging all the sensors into USB 2.0 ports that are on separate controllers on the motherboard, and plugging the headset into a 3.0 slot. For some reason none of the sensors worked plugged into 3.0 slots and their data bandwidth is too high to share 2.0 controllers.Final thoughts:now that oculus has hand presence and room scale as well as a number of high quality games to play I feel like we are past the early adopter phase and I would highly recommend it to any game enthusiast with a powerful computer and a lot of patience and willingness to troubleshoot for hours. Also sharing the VR experience with your friends and family is great fun.

I purchased a VR ready PC previously, so setup was a breeze. I don't have enough room for a room scale setup and this system works great. I was able to find a program (VorpX) that let me run 3D applications (like Skyrim and Borderlands 2). The touch controllers are comfortable and work with most applications  without any real setup. It works far better than my dad's Gear VR for his Note 8, but not quite as good as my friend's Vive.

Adding a third sensor to your Rift setup eliminates most occlusion issues (i.e. when you're body blocks the view of a controller from the sensor), but it isn't immediately noticeable depending on how the other two sensors were setup previously. It goes from good to pretty much perfect roomscale tracking.Each sensor tracks up to about 3m before the quality starts to degrade (controllers/headset appear to wobble a bit after 3m), so an ideal Rift VR space using three sensors would be about 3x3m, but it can be stretched up to about 4x4m. Of course, it works in smaller spaces perfectly fine too.It also comes with a 16ft active USB 2.0 extension cable, so the cable is long enough to be out of the way after setting it up.

Wow, what a difference the third sensor makes. If you own an Oculus Rift, do yourself a favor and get this. The included cable works great and price is well worth the experience. It is the exact same sensor you get that is included with the Rift. It detaches from the stand if you want to mount to wall.I used these mounts:

I didn't know what to expect other than watching you tube videos. You really are apart of the game. I haven't got past Robo Recall yet because it is super fun.

The Rift is very immersive and great as long as you have the PC to back it up (which is something that should always be mentioned). Adding a third sensor to the mix lets you get the most out of the system, since it gives you room scale for playing games that let you walk around your space. The Touch controllers are capacitive so that games that use it can sense some of your fingers lifting from its grasp to let you point and wave or make a fist, and they fit very snug in your hands. With the three sensors, I would put this system slightly above the Vive for a perfect set up.

Didn't even try the Rift without the 3rd sensor so I can't really give a before and after comparison. It is pretty amazing to have the immersion of wherever you turn to be surrounded by the game. Just wish I had a bigger space to operate it from. The only negative would be that you could argue that it should include the 3rd sensor in the box and wall mounting but I did get the Rift for a pretty good sale price so I'm happy. The wall mounts for my Rift were purchased from https://www.amazon.com/Mount-Oculus-Rift-Sensor-Pack/dp/B07BL4LR9N/ref=asc_df_B07BL4LR9N/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=241923266288&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=3430681748644664705&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9030031&hvtargid=pla-493421605175&psc=1

I'm happy to review this.  I personally think this is the best VR device.  It works a little unusually, (acts as a very unique display) but it's very authoritative about it's presence in your drivers and working with NVIDIA.  It has a great amount of compatibility and I find it able to run without -any- fuss.  The community is special.  Very kind and friendly.  The staff is very personable and interested.  The display is great, if you have enough power, you can make games look super crisp using Oculus Tray Tools.  It's not blurry as older systems or as some people may claim.  A couple of precautions:  Alot of vid cards that claim to be VR ready, only have one HDMI port.  Make sure your monitor has an adapter or use a different cable.  Just make sure you can accommodate both monitor and rift.  Add it to your order, you will thank me.  Nvidia 1060 is as low as I would go for graphics card.  It will work fine on that if you have a great CPU.  You will not be able to ""squeak by"" very well, and I pull for trying to.  VR games this year have been a little lacking, so if you want to take a year and upgrade your computer, that's a good idea.  You aren't missing anything incredible just yet.  It's just important your hardware can handle it.  I personally love it to pieces and I think it's great and I love the controllers.  They seem to have more resolution than my pen tablet which is awesome.

It's actually quite impressive how durable these controllers are. I've accidentally punched quite a few objects in real life while using these controllers, and they still function perfectly. Props to Oculus for anticipating that these controllers might get roughed up a bit during normal use and making them sturdy enough to withstand that sort of abuse.Functionality-wise, I can't recommend these controllers enough. If you have a Rift, the Touch controls are a must-have. Pretty much every decent game I've played requires them, and I don't think I'd use my Rift much at all if I didn't have these controllers.

I'm changing my past review as I was mistaken about USB 2.0 and 3.0 for a 3rd Oculus Sensor. USB 3.0 is better for the Oculus Sensor than USB 2.0. However, the Oculus manual says that you shouldn't have more than two sensors running with a 3.0 USB port at a given time. Thus, if you connect your two main sensors and this third sensor on 3.0, your sensors will not function properly. Having your third (rear) camera on 2.0 will work properly. I learned this the hard way. Keep in mind to ensure that your third sensor is no further than about 10-12 feet away from your front sensors.

II feel like I’ve been waiting for VR since the early 90’s when 3d accelerated games were taking over. It Just seemed like VR was the next obvious step. Well, it took another 20 years but we are finally there and so far I’m pretty happy with the technology.It takes a pretty powerful PC to push the Rift but, but not excessively so considering this is a niche market item at this point. The system pushes a lot of pixels to the small monitors in the unit but still you can easily see that VR in the future will need even more to rival smoothness of a high res desktop display. Presumably this experience is related to the fact that the VR simulated environment is covering almost all of your field of vision as opposed to just a small part of it like a monitor would.The price is a little steep relative to most gaming gear but, it's cutting edge. The price will come down. It's an early adopter product at this point but i have to say that as far as early adopter gear goes, it's been surprisingly robust. Pretty reliable software and a pretty polished product. The responsiveness of turning your head and immediately having the environment respond is impressive. I can’t detect any kind of lag. The unit is reasonably light, but does run a little warm. I almost always have the ceiling fan running when using it because I get warm.I haven’t experience any discomfort that related to motion in the games which seems to be pretty subjective. But so far I seem impervious.I’m an adult gamer so I only have a few hours to play but so far the Oculus (and their exclusive games) have been compelling. Kittypocalypse, Chronos and Project Cars have been my favorites. It’s impressive to see the variety of games on the system and to see that it’s not just first person shooters.Negatives:The only things that I don’t like are that Oculus made their own store. I can understand why they would have wanted to do that, but I hate buying games from a different place than all of my other games (Steam). Steam games do work on Oculus, but launching them is clumsy requiring you to take off the head set.

It works !  I've read a lot of reviews saying a 3rd sensor is overkill.. BUT... for 50 dollars basically its worth it.  You get much more coverage, and no dead spots when you turn around.  If this was really expensive then it would be overkill but for 50 dollars addon cost.. not bad. Product is OEM and works just when you plug in.  One thing I did notice that no one else has said in a review.. the 3rd sensor MUST go into a USB 2.0 port .. and the other two MUST go into USB 3.0.When you set up the 3rd sensor.. it tells you USE A 2.0 port only.. and put the other 2 sensors into the 3.0 ports.

The Oculus Rift is an extraordinary virtual reality HMD that provides a stellar gaming and media experience.  However, in my time owning one I have come across a few road blocks.-USB Bandwidth  This is completely dependent on the power of your PC's USB 2.0 and 3.0 chips.I found that I had to plug my sensors into an external USB 3.0 A/C powered hub before I could play without issue.-Oculus Home SoftwareWhile playing in VR, be sure to occasionally monitor your resource usage in task manager, for some applications will bottleneck and cause Oculus Home to crash and restart, which more often than not, interrupts gameplay and causes a restart.  On some occasions, you can overload your GPU and cause your monitor AND headset to both black out for anywhere from seconds to minutes.  Remember that VR is very much still in development, and the way it interacts with your PC could be different than another.  That being said, always make sure you are following Oculus' guidelines on minimum specs.  (At times, this can be lifted for USB usage, for both the sensors AND the headset function on USB 2.0)Overall, the Oculus is not a flawless system.  The facial interface padding can often get hair caught in it, or build up sweat during intense gameplay. The onboard headphones included are rather prone to breakages in the plastic joints that keep them together.  Visually, after trying the WMR, Vive, and Oculus, I much prefer the rift as it gives you a crystal clear image with minimal screen door effect as well as providing a far wider sweet spot in clear sight as opposed to something like a WMR headset.As far as tracking quality goes, I do recommend investing the extra $60 ( as of February, 2019 ) into a third sensor.  This sets you free in the sense that you are able to play in a 360° space, rather than a forward facing environment.My summary on the headset is that it easily compares with the HTC Vive and can compete with its similar quality of experience as well as a price of $350 ( Again as of Feb 2019 ).  If you enjoy the concept of Full Body Tracking however, I would recommend that you give the HTC Vive a look-see as currently there is no such support on the Rift unless you're looking to drop $600 USD on the Light-house sensors and Vive Trackers. (Yes, you, VRChat user.)Otherwise, give this bad boy a spin.  Though it has its flaws, it has served me well thus far and I hope others will be able to enjoy it.

This thing is radical departure from the everyday. The environments are very convincing, not perfectly authentic to the real world, but close enough for you to lose yourself. No nausea at all. Robo Recall is tremendous fun, and challenging. Raw Data is even more challenging. The downside is set-up--it takes about 10 minutes to arrange & calibrate everything from scratch. If you have a dedicated space for VR, that would be ideal & speed things up a bit. The cables are also a drag, but the new systems take care of that.  Build quality is excellent. I'm running this on an Alienware i7 with 8GB RAM & a GeForce 1080, so power hasn't been an issue.  The upside of course is that this will allow you to experience things that would be otherwise impossible. Travel the world. Travel in time.

Bought this to go with the two current sensors ive had since purchasing an oculus. I tend to really move and completely spin around in certain games, which puts my body infront of the hand pieces and disrupts the sensors tracking. The use of a third sensor really helps prevent that issue and makes tracking smoother overall. You y'know, sort of why we have the saying ""triangulating your posistion"". The length of cable attached to the actual sensor is about 8 Feet long, i believe. The additional cable supplied is indeed about 16 feet as well. Collectively, you'll get 24 feet of cable length out of this purchase. Far enough to reach the back side of a medium sized room, which is where I put the third sensor.

This system is amazing.However, I have had it for about 7 months now and there is one major problem that I have noticed.The sound in the left speaker started to break up. Then it went out completely. I did send it in for warranty work. Customer service has been great so far. I say so far because the air freight company that handles UPS shipments here in Alaska has managed to lose my package. So it has not made it in to Oculus yet. Not the fault of Oculus, but there is more to the story.I have two units. I was playing Beat Saber last night, and sure enough the sound in the left ear is starting to crackle and cut out. My research of this problem reveals that this is a common problem with the unit. The sound for the unit comes out of the HMD on the right, goes to the right speaker, and then proceeds around the back of the HMD headband to the left speaker. Seems that the problem is in that passage around the back.I will most likely remain a Oculus user, but in the future I will most likely remove the speakers from their mounts and route the cables for my Turtle Beach Elite Pro headphones along with the Rift cables and use the TB headphones for sound and mic.Oculus, please find a fix.

The Oculus Touch controllers definitely add an important, new dimension to games played with the Rift headset. Having now used both the Vive and the Oculus, I can say that both systems have their pros and cons. The Oculus Touch controllers are solid, well built, and perform as you would expect. It takes a short amount of time and experience to get accustomed to them and their button layouts, but once you do, they are wonderful. And getting the free download of Robo Recall (the current promotion at the time of my writing this review) is icing on the cake; and an appropriate demo for the Touch controllers.

These work great.  Though you don't have full 360degrees like on the Vive (I haven't used this myself), this fit my space where the Vive could not.  It is still completely immersive when playing games like VR Sports, The Climb, and The Unspoken.  Using these in these games feel completely natural.  You somewhat forget you even have controllers in your hands at some points (because of this, make sure to use the string to secure them to your wrists).  I have enjoyed these immensely and if you have an Oculus Rift, this really is a must own.  The controller games are great, but there is nothing quite like climbing up the side of a mountain or shooting some fireballs with your own virtual hands.  These might be even better with a 3rd sensor, but I don't have the space to add one to find out.

I recommend you have a gtx 960 or above, but I have not had many issues.I have owned this product for about a month and I love it.There are so many things I love about this product but let me say this now.DO NOT BUY THE VIVE IF YOU ARE ON SOME SORT OF BUDGET!Let me run down the reasons of why I love this product, then I will get to why you shouldn't buy the HTC Vive over the Oculus Rift.-Great community with friendly people.-Touch controllers are great and ergonomic.-So many free games that will keep you playing for hours.-Comfortable on head, even if it gets a little hot.-Very adjustable.-Headphones are very nice and sound great.-Support is pretty good.Alright, here are some things to keep in mind.-If your headphones stop working, use the included screwdriver thingy to tighten them and you should be good.-Submit a support ticket as soon as you have an issue to make sure you can get a replacement.-There are tons of free games, so don't feel the need to buy a ton of extra games.-A third sensor will give you 360 degree tracking and roomscale, but it is $60.-If you have 2 sensors, mount one looking forward at medium-high level and one on a stand face slightly downwards to get coverage of the floor.-Make sure you face your sensors while playing games so you don't have immersion-breaking experiences.Why not to buy the Vive?Things that the Vive offers over the oculus--Better tracking out of the box-Better steam supportThings that Oculus offers over the Vive--$200 cheaper-Better controllers-More games including some great Oculus exclusives.-Comes with built in Headphones-Still works fine with SteamVRIt's up to you, but the Oculus is my clear winner.This amazing product will keep you twisting and turning for hours.

I'm not really sure where to begin on a review of this. The rift is a very good system. It tracks well, and gives you some amazing visuals. I've enjoyed playing standing VR games, as well as some games that are simply enhanced by VR and all are better for it. Elite Dangerous is amazing when coupled with VR. Everything feels like solid construction, and the set up is easy. It's a comfortable headset that I've worn for hours at a time when in a gaming session.All I can really say is I highly recommend it.

Of course having a virtual reality headset is cool but it is easy to get annoyed and sick of it. My computer easily runs the games and handles the headset but for some reason things still crash, and at first the vr seems really trippy and weird but then like anything your body gets used to it and it dosent feel different or cool anymore.  Also the lenses of the headset constantly get foggy and dirty so you have to constantly clean them, and lastly it easily strains your eyes which alone reduces the amount of time you can actually use it.

I bought the Oculus Rift a few weeks ago and I only have great things to say about it so far. I will say this though. BUY A THIRD SENSOR. It transforms the experience because once you make it 360 degrees with roomscale shooting zombies, or playing games like robo recall where you actually have to turn around become even more amazing. Something to keep in mind with the set up, watch what kind of lights you use, small lights like Christmas lights will mess with the sensors and you will have tracking issues. I would also suggest getting a replacement headpiece, the one it comes with is fine, but does collect sweat. You can buy a rubber one you can clean with anti bacterial wipes for 30-40 if this is an issue for you. I have only good things to say about this, get one.a

Had an ok time when it did work as expected.  It is pretty bad at first getting use to looking at everything through a weird screen door effect, but you get use to that.  However it's near impossible to get a clear image through the full field of view.  The sensors and touch controllers were incredibly finicky with which USB 3.0 ports they'd work on.  Eventually, one of my controllers stopped pairing all together.Do not buy.

I tried to temper my expectations because VR tech is still new, but the experience is more polished than I thought it would be. I do feel a sense of immersion, but what I especially enjoy are the small details: the ""guardian system"" which displays a transparent wall around your play area to help prevent you from bumping into things, and the fact that you can see the location of your controllers even when they are not in your hands (so that you can just reach out and pick them up off your desk). The technology has already come a long way and I can't wait to experience future generations of the Rift.

We LOVE this VR system! Once we got it up and running we were amazed with just the little intro game ""First Contact"". I did run into some issues with installation but I think it was the fact that my laptop had some bad drivers. After trying everything that came up in the forums, the last option was to do a full factory reset and reinstall windows. Since my laptop has 2 drives (SSD for the OS and a 1TB HDD for storage) this was not a big deal. After a fresh install of windows and re-installation of the Oculus software, we were up and running in under 10 mins.

Literally the best gaming experience I have ever had. I have spent my entire life playing video games, and I've never before used something so intuitive and fluid. VR is finally here, and the tech is up to par. Half of the time, I feel like I'm really there because I'm so immerssed.The only drawback of the Rift and Vive systems respectively is the PC required for usage.Setting up the rift was fine, and just as easy as I think Oculus had intended it to be: streamlined and simple. The room mapping with the Guardian line thing was odd to set up at first, but I just think I didn't read the instructions all the way.With all of the tech you get in the box, (Rift Headset, Touch Controllers, and two sensors,) the rift also comes with 6 games. Among them, Robo Recall, Quill, and Medium are my favorites. I purchased SUPERHOT VR and Lone Echo ( which is the best oculus first party game, and an insanely good game on it's own. If you're thinking of picking up a Rift get that game.The reason most people go to Oculus for the games is the price. For $400, (or $380, $350 depending on the sale prices) you get A LOT. before, paying $800 or even $600 as the price of the HTC vive right now, it isn't really worth it, considering that I'd the price of most gaming PC rigs.If you're gonna buy a VR Headset, get the Rift. For the money, you get the same experience as the HTC Vive, but for cheaper, and executed better. The build quality and comfort on the Vive is minimal compared to the Rift, too.

It's a little techie to set up and use.  Need a computer that can handle VR.  Did not work at first until I figured out yo unneeded an HMDI cable from your monitor to the graphics card.

The setup process is finicky and somewhat counter-intuitive but the again so was the original two sensor setup. This can be a little more aggravating though as it seems that the setup process occasionally wants you to place the sensor in an area or facing in a direction that may be obscured. I suppose the best option is of course to have as much open space as possible. That being said, tracking is much improved and not be tethered to the forward facing setup in games is great. A must have for those Oculus owners who have the play space.

Additionally they make the headset cooler because you no longer have large headphones covering your ears. If you prefer ear buds over earphones I highly recommend making the switch.

I would recommend to get some lens protectors especially if you have glasses and keep a fan on when playing.

First off; these controllers are incredible. At first I got my Rift for seating sim experiences. Always thought motion control would never be my thing. So a friend brought his touch controllers and then I immediately bought my own. They absolutely change the experience in a way that has to be tried to be understood.Though, I wouldn't give this 5 stars just yet. Right now Oculus tracking has issues. 360 tracking and roomscale requires a 3rd sensor and you might have USB issues causing you to buy more stuff to get it working! It's finicky and difficult to setup. BUT when it is set up; it exceeds the Vive experience by a long shot. Vive wands simply lack the comfort and  immersion that these controllers give you.I will only recommend these and give a 5 star review IF Oculus gets their 360 and roomscale tracking sorted out

There aren't many things that make me eager to write a review but this Oculus Rift is by far the greatest piece of technology I have EVER owned.Since it's inception and the subsequent kickstarter by Palmer Lucky I was blown away by the very idea of Virtual Reality. It seemed like something right out of the sci fi movies we all grew up loving and I just had to have it...then came the $600 headset minus the (then) incomplete touch controllers at an additional $200. On top of that I would need at least a $1k pc to run it, the cumulative cost of it all shelved my immediate dream of owning a rift.Then came the sale.At $400 THIS IS A STEAL.Make no mistake about it, at HALF the price it was originally with the touch controllers: this is the best value for money that you can get a complete, professional V.R. experience and believe me it is sooo worth it.The Vive may have better roomscale tracking but its not worth the $200 difference (previously $400 but Vive realized the price diff was suicide)as I have great roomscale with my 2 sensors mounted at opposite corners of my play area and prefer the (slightly) better screen clarity, much more comfortable weight and the single neat cable that runs to the HMD itself. Another win is that the Oculus has access to all the Vive game without the need for any hacks or tech savvy (just download steam vr)All in all, if its archery practice, checking out the solar system or killing rogue robots, I am able to completely immerse myself in other worlds as well as my own (Google earth VR is amazing) VR is the future....right now and there is no better time to get on board.

This system works much better than I expected.  The immersion is beyond belief and even though you know it's just virtual, it's very hard to step off a virtual cliff.  I'm using a GTX 1080 card, and there is no detectable lag from head movement to image update, so there is no motion sickness. (or VR sickness.)  In my old age, I tend to be more sensitive to that than other people.  I'm an EE, and I'm amazed they can track head movement to such a fine resolution.

Oculus nailed it. I didn't realize how incomplete the Rift was until I got the Touch controllers. I've been gaming since I got my first Apple ][ in 1978 and dreaming of VR since I went to work in the CAD industry in 1980. I've lost interest in CGI stuff for the last 10 years or so but the Oculus products have opened up a brand new experience for me.The setup was easy. The tutorial with the robot and the virtual 3D printer was awesome. There were butterflies everywhere. 8}  I can now free up the USB slot from the XBOX controller.My main problem is that I need to rearrange my cozy computer room to get at least a 7x7 play area. Then the decision has to be made to get one or two more controllers, though in my current 5x5 play area I don't really need them.

Speaking as a VR skeptic: the Oculus Rift is by far the most exciting thing to happen to gaming this decade! It is 100% worth the price! This package comes with two touch controllers and two sensors, including the headset and all required cables. You can set this up in 30 minutes and get to playing fast. The touch controllers net you 6 free games, including Robo Recall which is an amazing title and possibly the best VR game to date! I recommend looking into a VR headset cover for the facial foam. The base model tends to pick up a lot of sweat and get gross unless you clean it thoroughly. A cover will help with this.

Pro's: very lightweight, very comfortable, easy to adjust to your head and the touch controllers are very accurate lightweight.the whole system feels like a very polished product was also very easy to set up. The controllers also seem VERY low on battery consumption. i played for about 6 hours straight on robo recall on the day i recieved this and the battery indicators have yet to even move down a notch.Cons: controllers take just a standard AA battery i would probably invest in rechargeable AA's. the foam padding is a concern because the front of my face gets a little muggy inside of the rift head set when playing a game that gets a bit intense. the padding insert is removable for cleaning but still a little of a hassle, would like to see a 3'rd party or even name brand smooth non absorbent silicone option or something like that.  if you pc game with steam as your platform it is compleatly supported by steam it just takes a bit of research to get steam Vr running on it.overall this i do not regret this purchase one bit. my complaints are practically negligible. out of all of the VR options out there this one is definitely the most polished i highly recommend it, the touch controllers is what really sold me on it they have a much more immersive feel and are closer to the natural positioning of your hands in real life vs waving around a couple big sticks like the psvr or vive. also if you're like me and you live in a small apartment this is a much more practical option for the best experience possible.

I like this headset.  The setup was easy.  I only put the sensors on my desk and they work great.  Sometimes the tracking is off, but apparently I can set them up differently to get better tracking.  I have to experiment.  Oculus says on their website to space them apart at separate sides of the room so that one is always facing the headset.  But I haven't tried that yet.  I subtracted a star because I am getting some really bad light artifacts from the lenses.  At first I thought that it was just the game itself, but now I'm sure it's from the lenses.  It's like the lenses were designed to get rid of the barndoor effect, which is not visible, but then caused huge light artifacts, like glare or sun rays, to appear.  This causes dark scenes with bright objects to have some severe light streaks.  This is somewhat annoying and distracting for me.

VR is really amazing! I enjoyed the Oculus Rift for the short time I owned it. I really enjoyed the immersion and the first contact demo had me smiling and screaming like a little kid again! However, I had to return them because it was just too uncomfortable with my glasses. My glasses are around 140mm wide which are just under the recommend 142mm width of glasses that Oculus recommends. While I was able to get the Rift to fit over my glasses by putting the headset on from front to back it was just too uncomfortable for me. My parents were able to use it comfortably because they have much smaller glasses than me. My Dad has big retro plastic glasses and was comfortable but his glasses are not as wide as mine.So, I highly recommend the Oculus Rift to anyone with no glasses, contacts, or glasses under 140mm wide. I highly recommend buying from Amazon only and not a third party seller since Amazon has an awesome return policy. While a third party seller should honor returns since they have to follow Amazon rules it is just peace of mind to know Amazon wont question you whatsoever!

The controllers also fit just like a glove (in the sense that they just feel so natural to hold).

I got this a couple weeks ago and I've been having a blast playing the included robo recall, medium, and free steam vr games. I also recommend you pick up super hot vr. When I put it on and adjusted it I was a little let down by the image and the perceived point of view, but once I got into a game it all faded away and I was left with an amazing experience! The display is smooth, the controllers are responsive and comfortable, and the setup was pretty painless. I would definitely recommend you use the Oculus compatibility check from their website and run the steam vr benchmark. The Oculus requires 3 USB 3.0 or above ports and an open HDMI port so make sure you have those, I had to use the two 3.0 on the front and one on the back to get it all connected. Additionally for ""improved"" tracking for 360 room scale they recommend a third sensor, but I haven't had any issue with putting the sensors at opposite corners of my play area (~2mx2m ) it'll give you an error during setup about the sensors being too far apart but just click next anyway and it'll let you continue setup.

But note that the accessory extension cable that is packaged with the sensor in this package deal is only a 2.0, not a 3.0, and this caused my Oculus Rift software to through errors about quality of the signal. Finally figured it out that this cable was the culprit causing the sad messages. I am replacing it so basically it was useless in my high end set-up.

Nice VR System.Cons: The 3d resolution is ok, not as crisp as expected, and blurry when objects appear to close or too far away. It was also not clear when I purchased this on Amazon what caliber and type (Windows Only) hardware was required to run it. Controls are ok, some are frustrating, like popping up the menu constantly while trying to play (changed menu setting to long press to help with this.)Pros: Really fun and interactive games andTools. Whole family loves playing on it. We have a fairly small space setup for it 5x6 ft and it works just fine.

An amazing purchase! So glad I’ve bought Oculus VR, but there’s a few things you should know1.) I highly suggest buying usb extender cables, it makes setting up the sensors and moving around so much easier!2.) I suggest buying a third sensor. I know, I know. 60 dollars is A LOT to spend on a new sensor, especially since you are buying an Oculus. But it WILL enhance your overall experience. No more weird bumps and hiccups while playing that ruins your immersion.

All in all everything is ok and is fun to use the only downside is that the cable that plugs in your hdmi that then goes to your headset is faulty. The cord was pinched winched causes it to stop working during gameplay and mess with the wire till the video comes back for maybe 20-40 minutes. Which oculus doesn't sell the replacement cable on there site so I had to spend an extra 150 dollars to buy a replacement. If buying second hand ask the seller for a video showing that everything works correctly. If I knew this I would have bought a different headset from another seller.

The experience is so surreal. I didn't expect to be so immersed but I was wrong. The trackers do an incredible job tracking every movement with no lag what-so-ever. They're also easy to setup and isn't picky about their placements. I live in a small apartment and my room is quite tiny so if I can set it up without fuss, then anyone should be able to as well. Just be careful, you can easily lose yourself in the VR and forget where you are unaware of your surroundings.

Before buying this, i had very high expectations. They were exceed by far.I was expecting some gimmick effect, like you have to put some effort to feel it real... but the inmersion is real and it feels incredible. No lag, no latency, you can look around, move,peek around a corner, etc. (Of course you need a high end PC). When you interact with other persons, you feel like they are really there. The inmersion is so real that you can feel sick with fast motions or playing for too much time.Im in my 30s, for my this is like the first time i played nintendo, or the first time i connected to internet. This is a game changer, the next step on entertaiment.There are very great games for free in the store, and some apps only for visual experiences.If i have to name a bad thing, i think is the lack of people for some great multiplayer games, especially those that are not free.Overall, i totally recommend this product, is true that is in some early stage and the amount of games and apps are limited, but the possibilities are endless, i cant wait to know what the future hold for this technology.

VR in 2019 should not be this expensive, not when the headset is nearly as old as Xbox one. That said, the experience is definitely worth every penny.

My initial excitement for this product immediately disappeared as soon as I discovered the impossibility of even installing the basic software to run this piece of abandonware. Despite my best efforts, the driver installer simply COULD NOT connect to the Oculus server, rendering this product unusable. The lack of tech support, combined with the fact that this problem is apparently extremely common with this device, which unbeknownst to me has not been remedied by Oculus despite enduring years of complaints by Oculus owners, completely turned me off from this product. I regret wasting my time trying to get this hunk of junk to work. What should be a fun, plug and play experience is instead rendered into a not-so-fun slog through the byzantine third party tech support tutorials. What a disappointment, hard pass.

Got this as a third sensor in the back for my Oculus. It comes with an extender cable which provides plenty of room for me to place it behind me when using the Oculus.  These are a little pricey, but I believe you need the 3 sensors to really immerse yourself.  Without the third sensor, it is easy for the headset to drop out when turning your head too far in one direction.  At least it was for me, but that may be my own fault with how I have the front sensors.

I am reviewing these simply as a VR controller. In that regard they are awesome. They truly act as an extension of your hands and for someone less dense than I probably have a shallow learning curve. Very hard to tell A and B from X and Y especially for a PC gamer that never uses gamepads.  However they are responsive and work great. Very accurate tracking. Comfortable and easy to let dangle when you need your hands. The joysticks work well and the transport scheme is easy to learn. I loved them. They also work passably in Vive apps.

Got this to add as a third (3rd) sensor. It adds more accurately for tracking for my roomscale play. This sensor makes me feel like I’m back to my Vive game (in terms of tracking). In fact,  comparable to my Vive. If Vive was 100% tracking. I’ll give this with 3 sensors a 96%. It’s almost there. But enough to not be bothered by it.

Omg, you people. I am in the future.Seriously, I am a dedicated PC gamer and a sci fi geek, but this... This is the future. From the intro experience, it is a total immersion.Games are pricey but there are frequent special offers and free experiences too. I love horror movies, but let me tell you, this is a whole new level. I tried a ""moderate"" horror experience and couldn't stay for more than one minute, it was so scary to actually feel inside the experience. Sci fi games are amazing. I am playing Farlands every few days (it is a free experience where you are a ""space cadet"" researching new species on various planets) and it feels like I am right in there feeding cute aliens for real.Touch controllers are intuitive.I am running this on the following specs: Windows 10 x64, Intel i5 3.10 GHz, 8GB RAM with GeForce GTX 1060 6GB. Runs like magic.Do you get motion sickness from using this: no, not from just using it. Motion sickness can be caused by specific games that imitate motion but fail to do it realistically. Does it cause headaches or vision troubles: not in my experience so far. It is not like 3D glasses in a cinema or those devices you put a smartphone in. The lenses create full immersion with a perception of a ""natural"" sight. You do not ""see"" any part of the visor when it is on.The best purchase of the year.

There are no words to explain the sensation of being IN whatever game is played. I play Elite Dangerous, and in VR mode it is impossible to explain the feeling of reality, my body actually believes it is moving and is in a 360 deg. environment.

While I could still run with a USB 2.0 cable, I purchased the additional sensors to ensure I would not have any tracking loss. Using a USB 2.0 cable with the 3.0 capable system was not part of the plan.I'm leaving 4 stars simply because the sensor can work on a 2.0 system as well as the price point of this bundle is priced equivalent to a stand alone sensor so I am not really out any money if I had of bought the sensor on its own. and then purchased extension cables on my own.

I've had this headset for 2 years now. I still use it almost daily. The foam ring that touches your face is a bit lacking but there's 3rd party fixes for that.I bought this at $250 when the Vive was $600+. Was a great deal. Holding off as long as I can until I have to buy another HMD.

Absolutely amazing experience and was glad that I did some research first to make sure that my PC had the slots required and the requirements to run this.  The only thing that I wish had been more clear was the setup process.  You should download the Oculus program while waiting for the delivery so that once you plug everything in, you are good to go.I have not had any issues with getting my Rift to run and installing some of the recommended apps makes for a much better experience.

Its rare you see a piece of tech that gets absolutely positive reviews from seemingly everyone--this basically has.  Its even more rare to see this kind of feedback on an emerging tech (sorry VR is still not mainstream).  With that said it truly is among the best controllers I have ever used and delivers on all of the promises.  It makes the rift feel like the complete experience it was previously lacking.

When I was a kid in the 80's this is exactly what I dreamt about. I got the Oculus instead of the Vive because reviewers said the Oculus controllers were a more intuitive interface to VR.

For the price point this is an amazing piece of equipment. Controllers fit perfectly in your hand. I own both the Vive and the Rift and when I just want to slap on my headset and play a game this is the choice. The controllers are far smaller and lighter weight then the Vives. The biggest thing that the Rift lacks over the Vive is the front camera and phone Bluetooth functionality. If you are wanting to jump into VR and have a easy setup and jump right in the Rift is the product to get.

This is an impressive and exciting piece of technology, but can be very fragile and the warranty replacement procedure is VERY difficult. One of my Touch controllers stopped working within 3 weeks, so I got in touch with Oculus for a replacement. First, they had me create a VIDEO showing the controller and illustrating that it does indeed have a problem. THEN, they had me send them an error log (from a saved file in my computer). That was over a week ago and I have been told it might be some time before I hear back. In the mean time, the controller is dead.In short, you will have some homework if you hope to get a replacement of any piece of equipment. Keep your fingers crossed that they will one day send me a replacement. I am not holding my breath.

Okay, I usually do not write reviews but this warrants one. It's really impossible to explain VR to someone who hasn't experienced it buy I'll try. I wore it my first time amd originally was disappointed by how blurry it was but after I found out that I have to wear mh glasses in the headset everything is amazing. I'm nearsighted so assumed it wouldn't apply it does though. You will lose yourself in your games. I don't think I'll go back to playing games the old way anytime soon.

First let me say the presentation of the oculus is beautiful, the setup was also super fast and easy. With this being one of my first experiences with the oculus I can say this is definitely worth 350$. I’ve tried both the oculus rift and the Htc vive and both are excellent but the oculus touch controllers are just 1 extra step towards a more immersive experience. Everything considered this is definitely a 5/5 product worth the buy. Another thing to add is that buying a few 3.0 usb extensions, another sensor, and a hdmi extender makes the experience a whole ton better in full 360.

When you are working with signed code, you update your certificates; any programmer knows this. So how in the absolute heck did they expire, effectively bricking every Oculus Rift on the planet? How did a team of people, presumably of multiple departments with a system of checks to prevent this, forget that? You usually put people in charge specifically of signed code! Usually, you have a system in place to prevent this!But let's try and put this day aside. I've had a month of fun with the games I've played on the Rift. However, I have had zero fun dealing with the Oculus software reopening on me after I've closed it multiple times, or the inexplicable 5 GB download when you download the software, or the way you HAVE to redo the dumb little demo every time you setup your Rift again, or the way so much of the system is still so inexplicably behind HTC.The games are fun; amazingly fun. I have had nothing but fun with VRChat, Holodance, and similar games. But I just can't reprehend Oculus as a company enough.There are too many annoying things about this device to recommend it to anyone yet; just wait. Wait until maybe someone buys it from Facebook and they put actual care into it.

An absolute must have for VR. Since it comes with an extra sensor and free game I can't say they're overpriced, but it's stupid how much these add to the experience. If you tried a Rift without these and were left less than impressed with being ""immersed"" these definitely change everything. I've instinctively opened my mouth to ""eat"" stuff in games on total accident and feel like a proper fool once I realized what I did.It's just crazy what these add to the immersion.I went from only caring about the immersive 3D in VR to caring about touch supported games and VR in general now.

I had perfectly fine tracking with just 2 sensors, you just put them on opposite corners of your play area from each-other and that works perfectly fine 95% of the time, but if you have a large play space then I could see how a 3rd sensor would have a dramatic improvement over tracking, but otherwise you really don't need 3 sensors if you're on a budget.

So far so good. I used the rift primarily for games. I skipped setting up the rift sensors as my current rift sensors placement is a bit unusual. I did try setting up the rift sensors but the setup won't approve my sensor placement so I actually didn't have a choice but to skip it. But even without setting it up properly, I didn't have any tracking issue when I play a game. I wear eyeglasses while playing. Didn't have any issue wearing the headset with eyeglasses. Headset was comfortable and didn't have any problem playing for a long time. I am not sure how it compares to other VR headsets as I never tried others but for me, this is really worth my money.

Overall I love the system. It really immerses you in games and is a lot of fun. I especially love it with driving games. Add a wheel, pedals and shifter to totally immerse yourself. There's just something about being able to look around inside a vehicle and at where you're going. Even though the graphics are still somewhat grainy in some situations my eyes adjust after a few minutes and that seems to melt away to a certain extent.However, keep in mind that VR in itself is still in it's early stages. A lot of the games that are currently out can tend to feel almost like demos as they are somewhat short. It's still a bit early in games being developed in VR and it's an expensive process so shorter games then you are used to can cost somewhat more. Some games can cause motion sickness in some people, if you are prone to this then you may want to reconsider. If you are expecting absolutely crisp graphics and can't accept certain things to be somewhat grainy then you may want to wait until VR in general advances. There are still bugs to be worked out and even though the dev team seems to be engaged with the community and are doing what they can to fix things, certain things can cause a bit of frustration trying to work out.A few accessories you may want to consider if you plan on purchasing a Rift:1. 10' HDMI extension cable (I bought 
C&E High Speed HDMI Extension Cable Male to Female, 10 Feet Supports Ethernet, 3D and Audio Return, CNE570921
). Although the Rift comes with about an 8' cord I needed more for my 15' X 15' space.2. 10' USB 3.0 extension cable (I bought 
Cable Matters SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Type A Male to Female Extension Cable in Black 10 Feet
). The headset plugs in with both HDMI and USB 3.03. A USB 3.0 PCIe card. Rift recommends 
Inateck Superspeed 4 Ports PCI-E to USB 3.0 Expansion Card - Interface USB 3.0 4-Port Express Card Desktop with 15 Pin SATA Power Connector, [ Include with A 4pin to 2x15pin Cable + A 15pin to 2x 15pin SATA Y-Cable 
] because this is one they know for sure works with the Rift. The sensors in the Rift are really power hungry. Sometimes, not in everyone's situation, the power draw of the sensors combined with whatever peripherals you have plugged in can draw too much power for your motherboard's USB controller. Also some USB 3.0 controllers don't play well with Rift. My USB 3.0 controller didn't play well with Rift so I purchased one and it works nicely.Even with the stated problems I do recommend the Rift if you want to feel more immersed in your gaming. It's a fun system and I don't regret my purchase at all. If you're not willing to work with some bumps and bugs though I'm not sure I would recommend it. You may want to wait for the next generation of VR if you're not willing to work with some drawbacks. Definitely make sure you run the Rift compatibility test  to make sure your PC is able to run it. One last thing to consider is if you wear prescription eye glasses as well. I had to buy some prescription lens inserts for mine because the headset smashed my glasses into my face making it uncomfortable. Not everyone who wears glasses seems to mind but I didn't like it.

Initially had some problems with the Oculus Rift. There support department was outstanding in helping to walk me through the possible solutions. Turns out that I was having a problem with plugging all the USB connections to the same USB controller and overtasking the controller. Once they had me split up the USB devices to different USB controllers to share the load the images got much better. That being said, I still believe that the resolution in the Rift headset is somewhat disappointing. Playing an air combat simulator on the monitor is MUCH clearer than the Rift headset. For now it is a tradeoff between the resolution of the computer monitor and the VR immersion of the Rift. Hopefully in the future the technology will improve enough to get the same resolution as you can see on your monitor.

Works perfectly.  Just like the other two you have.  Should you get it?  YES.  It makes tracking even better when you are backwards or on the fringe.  Money well spent if you care about accuracy.  And yes you can mount it upside down with NO issues.  Just run the setup after you put it in, and life is grand.

For a small time gamer this is a great headset for VR gaming. the only downsides to this product is the cords that connect the headset to your computer are a wee bit short for me as my computer is on either the ground or my desk while gaming. And the foam padding that sits in-between your face and the headset is a bit rough on the skin. if there was a pleather(plastic leather/fake leather) that covered the padding that would be great. other than this i love the headset and the controllers work great. I recommend you have a dedicated space to VR gaming if you want to get serious. other than that this is a great product and i would recommend it.

This should have been 4 stars product but I find myself returning it due to failure of the headset after 1 day.Initial set-up stopped in dead in my tracks saying some Windows updates were required.This would have been fine except they were actually installed.Had to resort to reading the Oculus user's forums to find a setting that tells software to bypass this check.After that set up went well.Initial tutorial is fun and nice to use.But you can tell Mr Zuckaman has had his grubby paws all over this and the social media/sales pitch stuff is overpowering.There is no way to just switch it off (without resorting to assorted forum advice I suspect)Managed with a few bumps to get it to work with the game a bought it for which is Elite Dangerous and can report the effect is WOW!BUTI'm returning it due to two failures!Early on one of the positional sensors was showing as warning about it missing a reading. It was ok after first install, but all I did was move computer and had unplugged all connectors and reconnected it in new location.And the headset is now not showing any display at all.  So I bought a very expensive sleeping mask.I can't fault the VR experience, but I feel the discount price is due to a lot of, possibly justifiable, bad reviews.Oculus Support seems reasonably responsive, but I've decide that returning the item is the best choice.May yet replace it with the same or look at the HTC Vive but that is more expensive.

Having a third sensor works great. Really does help give you the full 360 degree VR experience. Only reason I dropped it one star is because the included USB extension was USB 2.0. Oculus recommends that these devices be connected to a computer with highspeed USB 3.0. I had already ordered a USB 3.0 extension when I purchased this not knowing that an extension was included with it. The sensor will still function with USB 2.0 so this isn't a huge deal, but it should include the recommended cable. Other than that no issues with shipping or setup. It works great.

This is incredible. I'm not much of a gamer, but this is the future. Having your hands represented in a digital space, with a controller that is almost perfect by design, is amazing. For 360 you will need at least 3 sensors.I've played with the HTC VIVE, and tracking is amazing, but the wand does not compare to the touch controllers in comfort, or design. Plus when shooting with the wand, my aim always felt a bit off. With the touch controllers, I feel a bit more like I'm holding an actual fun and the Trigger feedback is amazing. 😊

I love the device. The build quality and overall presentation is nothing short of amazing. When I opened the box I thought even the presentation made me feel like I had purchased a quality product. But After owning it for less than a month the headset stopped working and I returned it. Four months later there was a sale and I figured I'd give it another try. Here we are, five months later, and it's stopped working again. I've gone to the forums and executed all the troubleshooting steps offered by users and in the documentation to no avail. I'm pretty disappointed that this happened again. I'd recommend going with the Vive instead based off my experience so far, but that comes with it's own shortcomings...

I am what you could call a ""tech-savy"" person. If I have struggled with this as much as I have, I can't fathom a ""normal"" person being able to enjoy this system. If you have windows 7 you're going to have a difficult time with the oculus. They constantly jab at you to ""upgrade"" to windows 10, because that's the operating system they want you to use. Well if you're like the rest of the gaming community you know that you don't want to use windows 10 for a variety of reasons (that i'm not going to get into now.)But upon immediate use I get an error saying that I need to install certain hotfixes (which I already have). When researching, it's a common issue that has existed with Oculus since it's launch and the developers have just refused to fix it. There is a way to bypass it with using the command prompt and run menu (which im not also going to get into right now).After 3-4 hours of constant issues and trial/error fixes I FINALLY got the program installed. When it was finally tuned in correctly (making sure the sensors and pre-determined height settings etc were configured) the program was amazing. It truly brings you into a different reality and it was as close as my generation will get to truly being able to pilot a ship in space.I take the system off my head and go to bed. I wake up the next morning, and the headset wont connect. Keeps saying there's an issue with the HDMI port. I tried the port with a different device and it works fine. So back again to the drawing board I go to figure out why the darn thing won't connect. As i'm sitting here, I think to myself. No device should take this much effort to use for the price they require you to pay. I am going to give this thing one more hour of effort to get it to work once again. If I fail, I will be returning it and get the HTC VR. I will update as I go.Update: So i've decided to return the rift and hold off on any future VR purchases until technology progresses a little further. The picture (while clear) is still blurry because you're not getting true 1080p per eye. I still have constant disconnect issues and I feel like I spend more time troubleshooting the device than I do enjoying it. So until the tech-world is truly ready to release the VR on a stable user-friendly platform. I will continue to wait.

Having started my gaming with an Atari system my uncle had and pretty much experienced every major game system since I can say that nothing has provided the kind of experience VR has.  Being able to move in game, using your hands in ways that, depending on the game, are extremely intuitive and natural is something you simply have to experience to appreciate.  Dual wielding laser swords like light sabers, even reflecting enemy fire back into them (Raw Data) is just about as awesome of an experience as you can get.I've the PC to run this very smoothly - i7-6700k, GTX 1070 in SLI, 16GB DDR, 500GB SSD.  So far a few things I've found.  Some games from the Oculus store require windows 8 or above.  I prefer to run windows 7 still though I have a dual boot SSD that runs 10  as well.  Some of these games you can get off Steam instead and run in windows 7.  So far the only game I've played that uses SLI is Raw Data, the Steam store version.  No game so far as maxed out GPU utlization with running just one of the GTX 1070.  Framerates have been very smooth.  Graphic fidelity is lacking.  The resolution in game is a far cry from the maxed out settings at 4K/HDR I can get playing PC games.  However that is not at all deal breaker.  The immersion value and smoothness of the experience outweighs (to me anyway) the loss of resolution.  The options beyond playing games are cool unto themselves.  VR desktop is basically Minority Report come to life.  You can watch movies in a virtual theater.  You can play 3D compatible games in a virtual theater.  All in all the level of immersion that VR provides is something you really have to experience to fully appreciate.Set up was a breeze.  The headset is not comfortable with my glasses - it puts a lot of weigh on the nose pieces and becomes pretty uncomfortable after more than a half hour and no amount of adjusting has helped.  However if I just wear contacts instead I can wear it comfortably for hours at a time.  The fact that the headset is corded really isn't a big deal, so far I've been able to move around in my designated game space without tripping or stumbling even once - my cats have not fared so well unfortunately.  It would be great if they could implement for the sensors to detect incoming objects and have them show the same way the boundaries for the edges of your mapped out space do.  My cats would be grateful.

These controllers are better than the vive controllers. Having an analog stick makes it easier to walk around and works better in my opinion than valves solution of pressing down on a pad to teleport everywhere. The ability to track your fingers better and having multiple face buttons adds to this as well as the vive controllers only have the haptic feedback pads on the front side which makes for some odd button combos at times.

Bought it for fitness (Boxing VR etc.) mostly but it is a great entertainer for guests as well. Just wish there was a better way to ventilate the headset or use a different material against the face. After 7-8 min of boxing even in a 70-71 degree room you start to sweat pretty bad and it makes the headset uncomfortable.

I'd NEVER buy another one of these.  The cable WILL break after about three months.  If you're out of warranty Oculus will NOT even sell you a replacement.  So find a box in your basement to dump this POS after warranty.  You won't be able to use it anymore.  I firmly believe Oculus is a company that is about to go under.

This was my first step into VR and I can honestly say it was mind blowing. It has exceeded my expectations. There is more to this than just playing games, there is plenty of experiences to enjoy. Well worth the money. Also, My pc setup for this includes, AMD FX 8370 processor, AMD RX 480 4gb gpu, MSI 970A SLI KRAIT EDITION motherboard, 16gb ram, running on windows 10. Keep in mind anything you run in VR is going to use more cpu gpu and ram than standard non VR gaming. But my setup has been very satisfying.

I found out you really need a third sensor located behind you, or your controllers will get dropped when you get turned around. The neoprene seal around your face wears out too fast as well. Contact Oculus directly and they can send you a replacement seal though. Other than that, I love seeing game worlds in 3D.

The videos you see of others using this do not convey the feeling of actually being in the virtual environment yourself.  I was not convinced to buy this until I was able to try it - I highly recommend doing so if you are skeptical (the Best Buy near me had a demo set up for people to try, so you might try there).  There are a huge number of games available.  The rift comes with Robo Recall for free (which is a great game).Be sure that you have a computer capable of running this or you'll be disappointed.  I had to buy a better graphics card (a ~$300 expense) so be sure to check that before you drop the money on this.

The only issue I have with the Oculus is that for a better experience you do need a third sensor, as turning around can cause the system thinks the controllers are somewhere else. Also you can't wear it with glasses, or at least not the kind I have. But VR is great  and the Oculus does have a few great games exclusive to the Oculus.

It was a mistake to keep relaying on the package sensors without the third sensor. Especially when it comes for those who want to play 360° degree games.However, had to deal with motherboard USB bandwidth ports in order to get the better results for the sensors. I cannot recommend this sensor unless your PC motherboard can give better USB bandwidth (Two dedicated USB3 channel, and one USB2).Overall, the sensor is enough to call it the complete part of Oculus experience.

AmazingBuy itEnd of review...Same price as PSVR and much higher quality. If you have a system that can handle this video card “GTX 1060” or higher yeah the box says it’ll run on less but you aren’t going to enjoy it. I’m on a 1080TI and it’s absolutely flawless everything on ultra quality it’s great. VR is a cool thing you really feel like you are there some games you’ll actually loose your balance and feel as if things are hitting you you du k and dodge it’s neat. My first exposure to VR was the original Rift and a tech show and it was not impressive they had it on a low end system with a crap racing game built in house. AAA studios like Epic put out Robo Recall and ID softwares Doom VFR are gaming on a whole other level. I had a Samsung gear VR and if you’ve used one of those with the Bluetooth controller this is the exact same experience except it’s on steroids the tracking is better the immersive experience is better as it’s a higher quality headset not wireless though so if I had to knock it for anything that’d be it but overal it’s great and it’s at the right price now. Prior to this version it was over priced and to get a good VR experience the way to go would be the PlayStation VR but now the new Rift bundle is about the same price and far superior to that setup.

The controllers work fantastically and look very polished. They fit comfortably and intuitively into your hands, there's no real time spent trying to figure out which controller goes into which hand and how you have to hold them. Many new games are available for the Touch controllers that are absolutely phenomenal as well. If you're considering whether it's worth it to purchase these to increase the fun of your Rift, the answer is yes.They come with an extra sensor and batteries for the controllers. Each controller takes 1 AA battery and has a magnetic cover that stays put.The packaging for the controllers is very similar to the Rift headset packaging, makes it feel refined.The Touch controllers provide a great new experience for your Rift headset, and bring them up to par with the Vive headset.Highly recommended.

Well worth the wait, incredible controllers. I had to buy a usb extension but now I am running the 2 opposing sensor setup and it is near flawless. Been playing Arizona Sunshine, superhot VR, the climb, etc. No issues at all once you get the sensors setup correctly. Finger gestures immerse you even more into the game. With the release of the touch and extra sensors this returns the rift back to it's throne as best VR experience.

The Oculus Touch controllers are pretty dang sensitive and they pickup on the slightest finger movements better than I anticipated. I thought they were malfunctioning at first, but then I realized it was the way I was placing my fingers close to the buttons. They take some getting use to, but once you understand how they work and figure out the button configuration they will most definitely add to your VR experience in a very big and natural way. I haven't touched the Xbox controller or the media remote since setting these two up. If you're getting an Oculus Rift then Oculus Touch controllers are an absolute necessity!

As an early adopter, I understand there will be issues with new technologies.  This one installed well for me (after I read other reviews about installing everything first before the product even arrives).  It took longer to get the sensors set up....go ahead and get a 3rd one and it's much easier and the cords are too short so go ahead and get extension cables for the HDMI and USB30 far sensor.  I recommend an Oculus Rift VR Cover (Green 2 pack).....as you will get a lot of sweat on the interface and the covers make cleaning it easy.  NOW for why I only gave them 2 stars CUSTOMER SUPPORT!.  I did enjoy many of the games I installed....a few crashed my system but I am a self claimed computer guru so that was no big deal.  However, after about a week the left OLED screen died.....first it turned everything to a green hue in the left eye then it just died.  SO I opened (a relatively complicated support system that requires one of those super hard to remember password settings) and opened a ticket to get a return RMA.......they never even responded to the first ticket.  A few days later I tried again....then I started getting the run around.  After each message with Support it takes 1-2 (sometimes 3) days for them to get back to you and they always ask for something different....even when you have given them everything they send you this one...""16, 5:09 AM PDT Thanks for getting back to us with that information.Please give us some time to review your case on our end with the details you've provided. We'll reach out to you once we have an update, or if we require any further information"" I still don't have an RMA and it's been over 3 weeks.  There are some alternative systems out there do your research perhaps other options have better customer support.  My guess is with equipment this sophisticated, folks are going to need better support to get this technology to the mainstream.  That all said, some of the VR experiences are really cool.

My rift has been collecting dust until I've picked these up. These are seriously a game changer. One to one precision with every game, haven't lost tracking once. The included games dead and buried and the vr sports collection are fantastic examples of how to implement stellar touch functionality into vr games.The controllers are comfy and ergonomic to any hand size. Trigger buttons on the index and middle finger are a bit squishy, but still very comfortable and I've definitely gotten use to them.My only small nitpicky complaint is that they make my hands sweat a good amount after 10 or so minutes of gameplay. Luckily with the wrist straps attached, I'm able to let go of the controllers and let them dangle while I air my hands out. Also they take AA batteries (one for each controller) so make sure you have those...not a problem more so just a heads up.Small nitpicky caveats aside, these are mandatory additions to the oculus rift and are necessary to get the full vr experience from oculus. Just make sure to pay $199 for them if you can, and don't get screwed over by the numerous scalpers selling them for higher this holiday season.

I'm bought my Oculus in August 2017 and it still works great. I've played many different types of games by now and have collected a fairly respectable Library of vr games through the Oculus store and steam and sometimes I still get that sense of awe when I put it on. It does have its moments where it bugs out, but these are very rare for me and expected from first generation Tech. Regardless this is a great headset, what the Oculus team was able to make here  is a amazing piece of technology, and just a small taste of greater things to come. I have no regrets.

Ok I know the first question most of you will have is Oculus vs Vive. Personally I can't answer this from experience so I will do my best from a research standpoint.The similarities: Both the oculus and vive have identical resolutions so you won't be regreting either in the sense of resolution. Both weigh similar so head strain will be similar and minimal with either. The tracking is really a middle ground. The vive is orders of magnitude easier to set up and works better right away. However the oculus can have very very close room scale with 3 sensors.The differences: For me the largest difference was the controllers. The vive has the wands which, as I have read, are kind of unintuitive to use compared to the oculus and are a bit heavier which isn't nesicarily a bad thing. I can easily say that after 30 seconds with the oculus I had the controllers down. I love the haptic feedback and touch sensitive buttons. Other differences are a shorter oculus cord which is actually hard to extend, you need a few parts. One is a working hdmi cable and hdmi repeater. The oculus also needs many usb ports. It recommends usb 3.0 but I use 2.0 for the sensors and it works fine. However I would highly recommend purchasing a usb expansion card. The oculus also looks a bit better in my opinion. The final difference is the tracking systems. The oculus sensors are a bit of a pain to set up and you really need 3 for room scale however I'm still using 2 because I haven't bought the expansion card yet. Once all done though oculus can keep up most of the time with the vive in room scale.My conclusion on which vr is superior: All articles you read will say it doesnt matter, me, not so much. I think the vive is a better vr. So why did I buy the oculus? Because it is better. Wait, I just said both are best, this spent make sense. Yup that is true and I will explain. The vive is best because the tech inside is much more advanced and easier to use. My one complaint is the controllers which will most likely be upgraded in the future. So why is the oculus better? Two reasons, one the controllers in their current state are far superior and two is the elephant on the table, price. The oculus is $400 and the vive is $600 and I don't know about you but better sensor tech isn't worth an extra $200. So I would recommend the oculus only due to the price drop. If it was still $500 I'd say go with the vive and buy the better controllers in the future. But it is your decision. If you want an easy setup and larger room scale go for the vive but if you are like me and are willing to settle for slightly less complex tracking with better controllers, the oculus is your headset.Now onto the actual product review.Ok I'm writing this in 2017 and in the past vr was always the future of gaming for me and when oculus cut the price I had to jump on it. Along with the rift plus touch I got a 3rd controller which I still need to utilize with the expansion card. First of all I would like to point out oculus' phenomenal packaging. It really makes the product feel premium and well made.The setup: From start to finish the setup probably took me and hour and a half. Much of this time is due to downloading the oculus software and apps so I would say do that before you receive your oculus. After this I had to setup my sensors. These are quite a drawback on the oculus because they must be plugged into your computer so I do have cables running across my ceiling for the third sensor. The positioning of the sensors isn't as crucial as many make it out to be but I would say have both or all three in different vertical positions. I did have some problems with the software recognizing the headset and sensors so I stress this again, just buy a usb 3.0 expansion card and that will make the whole process much easier. Once they were set up I had few tracking issues unless I was faced away from the sensors.The oculus in use: Thankfully with a pc running the vr the high resolution screens really immerse you and it is easy to not notice the picked or ""God rays"" which are diagonal lines of pixels that run across the screens. Like I mentioned earlier the controllers are very intuitive and easy to use and really make the vr lifelike. Tracking is accurate and if you have the ability for room scale I would recommend it , it is very fun and worth the extra setup.Games: With the touch controllers a few games are free. My favorite is Dead and Buried. However other classics like Super hot and rec room are very fun titles. Along with the oculus app is steam vr which opens up many more games and simulations. One type is racing sims which I have not personally tried but I can safely assume that they are very fun in vr. One miner caveat is standing on your feet can cause some discomfort so I would suggest wearing shoes or buying those padded flooring mats. No matter what the fame library can only grow and I can't wait to see what the future holds for vr.Extra things to note: Vr is fun but if you don't have a pc yo run it, well your screwed. The oculus is $400 but if you don't have a pc be prepared to spend at least $600 on a pc. That's how much I speant on mine. But you may want to spend more if you want to do other things with your computer. This taken into account with a third sensor, expansion cables, a usb expansion card, computer peripherals if you don't have them and a desk vr can cost easily over $1500. If you are prepared to spend that much or if you have a pc then go right ahead but always keep in mind hidden costs.Conclusion: Is it time to get into vr? In my opinion, yes. With the price cut, and considering you have the pc capable of running vr (oh and by the way to all you mac users, well vr can't run on mac, period. So you will need a windows computer) you can experience at home be for the price of many tv's or even plane tickets. Plus if you have never tried vr it is very fun and really a cool way to show how far technology has come in the past ten years. The future is almost upon us folks and vr  is along for the ride. In my opinion vr will be in many homes in upcoming years so if you want to be in on it early or if you want a new and cool way of gaming you are going to be happy.Also here are my gaming rig specs:Intel i7 6700kGtx 107016gb of ddr4 ram1tb hard drive256gb ssd650 watt psu

OMFG. Thank you Oculus! I'm not one of those people who want/need the newest model of something the first day it comes out. I hesitated on getting into VR since there weren't that many games available at launch, but more precisely the entry price point. When I saw OR advertised for $399 with motion controllers I just had to try it out. Granted I did spend more than that for accessories, I purchased a 3rd sensor, 3 USB extension cables, 1 hdmi extension cable, a face cover, a secondary HDD, and some stuff to hang the headset's cable on the ceiling, but the extras aren't necessary.The VR experience totally blew my mind away. I've had similar feelings when Super Nintendo came out, then PS and N64, but experiencing VR totally eclipses those by miles.The Oculus Rift is very well packaged and it really surprised me on how well refined it is. Setting it up was easy EXCEPT for the sensors. Ugh. It took me awhile to get them aligned correctly for room scale use, and even moreso when I got the third sensor (received a few days later).This was my first time experiencing VR, but the motion controllers are so well designed and intuitive that I didn't have to think about or look at them after finishing the tutorial.The only complaint I have is that one of the side straps bunches up a little when I put the headset back into the case. Doesn't effect anything at all, but I'm ocd like that. Maybe another one could be that peripherals are lacking, both from OR and 3rd parties: Lens screen protectors, covers for the faceplate, rig to hang headset wire to the ceiling, wall mount headset rest, etc. Yeah there is some stuff on the market, but it's all pretty meh from what I've seen so far.10/10 must try VR.

Go Rift if you are not sure which way to go.  I have had both.  I know the hype is out there for Vive; I know that no reviewer in the world could give a clear answer on Vive vs. Rift... But it is Rift all the way.1) touch is better than vive controllers have used both!2)  Rift is cheaper!  Less than $700 with room scale and touch.3). You get more free games and and additional $100 toward games on Amazon!!!4). Room scale on Rift requires less space!5). Vive is buggy.  My vive kept having issues staring apps after a few days (why I returned it)6). You can play most if not all of the Vive games on Rift AND YOU CAN STILL ISE STEAM AND STEAM VR APP IF YOU WANT TO.  Does not work the other way (not many Rift games can be played on Vive in many cases).7). Many more, better games on Rift8). Rift hardware is more comfortable by a lot and much easier to use and still has better feel and comfort even if you buy the $100 upgrade for vive (deluxe audio strap)!Where is Vive better):1). I like the steam ""home"" app better than Rift BUT you can STILL USE THE STEAM VR HOME APP on Rift!2). Rift app has to be used on one windows account, no share across family unless you use the same user!  But u can use the steam games across accounts using family share on steam.

I don't have the fastest PC in the world.  It was when I bought it, several years ago, but now it barely met the spec requirements for the Rift.  I did have to upgrade the video card.  With that said, it runs great on my machine.  I can't imagine what it would be like on one of the latest and greatest PC's with a $1000 video card.  The immersion is first rate.  I dropped one of my controllers because I was setting a VR object down on a VR bench and I just let go of it.  Definitely use the wrist straps because it will happen to you.  Also the very first thing you should download is Google Earth VR.  It's free and it would make this device worth the price if it was the only thing that ran on it.  I'm not going to try to describe the experience because if you've seen it I don't need to and if you haven't I can't.  There are no words.I only gave it four stars because I had issues with the setup.  Setup would not run because it said I didn't have 6GB free on my 1TB drive which had over 600GB of free space on it.  Took some digging on the interwebs but I managed to find a work around.

Honestly, I'm at about 4.5 stars, for this. It needs to be more breathable, and it needs to be higher resolution. It's already very high, but a little further, and not only can the screen door effect can be eliminated, but this could replace multi-monitor setups. You could have two or more 10ft virtual screens some distance from you and eliminate eye strain!I think Oculus and others know this, and will get us there as quickly as the evolution of technology allows. It's in their financial interest to do so. So, I've rounded up to 5 stars.A word of warning: acclimate to this, slowly. If you dive right into some faster-motion VR activities, or try use it for long periods, right away, it's only going to make you nauseous. Ease into it. Let your brain sleep on the experiences for awhile.

Touch is a wonderful addition to VR. It really can't be over-stressed just how impressive it is to have a controller setup like this. Even though you're limited to pointing, thumbs up, and grabbing, it really does change the game when you're controlling this for yourself instead of through the traditional gamepad that came with the Rift. It's night and day and, just like with Virtual Reality in general, it's hard to get a sense for the true experience unless you take the plunge and try it for yourself. If you already own a Rift, and you're still on the fence, stop here and just buy it. However, if you're looking to get into VR for the first time and you're comparing the Rift to the Vive, you should read on:The first thing that newcomers need to know is, that despite the price of the Oculus Rift + Touch being the same as the HTC Vive it directly competes with, this isn't a solution for room-scale VR. What this means, practically, is that you shouldn't consider buying this if you want to spin around 360 degrees in a game under your own physical locomotion. The Oculus Touch is designed exclusively for front-facing 180 degree VR experiences, so when you turn away from your cameras the controllers lose tracking and start acting weird. That's not to say that Touch isn't fun or isn't capable, honestly there's a lot of games that support this kind of VR and it's not bad at all, but any game that expects you to spin around under your own power is a no-go. The headset can go around 360 degrees just fine, and even supports something like room-scale with just the one camera and the Xbox controller it came with, but the Touch just can't do it on its own.That said, if you're absolutely certain you want to try room-scale with Touch, it technically is possible. All you need to do is buy into Oculus' very experimental room-scale setup, which starts with buying a third sensor from their store for $85 dollars and likely ends with either complete failure or a lot of extra money being wasted to achieve the same thing the Vive gets out of the box. The problem here isn't actually with Touch, or the Rift, or Oculus for that matter. The problem is, unfortunately, with your computer's USB controller setup. This is a complicated technical issue that boils down to the USB 3.0 standard being unintentionally awful for this purpose, but it also boils down further to the hard reality that your motherboard working with more than two Oculus sensors is luck of the draw at this point. Maybe in the future Oculus will release better sensors intended for room-scale or partner with Motherboard manufacturers to verify whether their USB setups are up to the task with a seal of approval similar to the ubiquitous AMD CrossFire stamp but, as it stands, the Oculus subreddit is littered with the tears of many a hardcore VR enthusiast that desperately tried to get this to work and ultimately failed. I'm not going to tell you not to go down this road, as it's your own choice, but room-scale with touch is not actually currently officially supported because of this and isn't likely to change any time soon.That aside, for what the Touch actually does work for it works extremely well. The official front-facing, 180 degree setup is wonderful, and there's a lot of support for it from developers. The two camera setup is solid and the controllers themselves feel good in the hand. Games with added Touch support feel fundamentally superior to their gamepad VR counterparts and games built from the ground up to support Touch are a ridiculously impressive glimpse into a future that honestly can't come soon enough. For anyone that jumped on the Rift early or simply prefers the Rift for their VR titles of choice, the Oculus Touch is an absolute must-have item that fundamentally changes the games for which it was made.The Oculus Touch easily earns my full recommendation.

This will be very quick - these are awesome. After waiting so long for them to release, I'm very happy with how they came out. Very comfortable, intuitive and easy to use. I've only used them on a few games thus far but no problems. No tracking or drifting issue though the sensor setup does take a bit of time to do and get right but once it's set you are good. One note, prior to these, I was using a gamepad and was able to sit and play with very little need to move much so didn't need much space. With these, a 5'x'7' space is highly recommended. Like the Wii, you WILL be moving a lot and really need to stand depending on the game. The sports game (I forget the exact title) that comes with these is fun and will really make you move so make sure you have the room to move around in. I had to reconfigure my space to get enough room.

As an owner of the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, I have to say I really prefer these controllers over the Vive wands. These essentially feel like console controls in terms of how they feel in your hands and button placement. Add in motion control, and you've got something pretty awesome.As is writing this, they do work on Steam. For room scale and SteamVR, I had a lot of issues getting it setup. I ended up just using the quick setup with SteamVR in which you just place the Rift and controllers on the floor in the middle of the play area and click OK. Setup in the Oculus software (required) was fine though, and didn't have issues with tracking like I did with SteamVR. The tracking issues during setup appear to be related to the Rift headset turning off while it sits unused in setup (or so that was my experience.)While I love these and gave the Rift 5 stars as well, I still recommend the HTC Vive ever so slightly for being easier to setup, the sensors don't need to be wired to the PC via USB 3.0, and you don't need to install the Vive software for it to work (you do NEED Oculus software installed for Rift.) There's also the fact HTC Vive users can use Revive to play Oculus games.If you have the Oculus Rift, you owe it to yourself to get these.

It requires some heavy computing power and i recommend upgrading your graphics card before purchasing this. I never regretted my choice of purchasing this. Use it everytime when I play racing games. I was little dissapointed when oculus server went down and couldnt play for like a day. Other than that, it is good stuff!

Did not work with my ASUS gaming laptop. In the setup process I got to the part where you put on the headset and finish the setup in VR. But when I put the headset on, there was no video. The headset was dark. Oculus tech support suggested that I roll back my Nvidia drivers but that didn't resolve the problem. They also suggested that I get an HDMI-to-Display Port adapter. This made things worse. The entire laptop would hang anytime I started the Oculus software with the adapter plugged in, requiring a reboot of the machine. Finally their response was that Oculus operation with laptops was ""problematic"" and they seemed satisfied that was an acceptable answer. (Hint: it isn't.) Further, there was no number I could call for real-time help.

This VR system is top of line and works with all the VIVE steam games as well. This is also a way better deal in my opinion than the HTC VIVE, which is $600 on sale. I have played both of them, and decided to go with the rift. I spent most of my time gaming in virtual reality, and I really like how immersive the experience is. Also, Robo Recall, a free game that comes with this product, has been my favorite VR game of all time. It was a super smart idea for oculus to bundle it with their product. I also like that the rift is backed by facebook, hopefully that means support will continue for some time.

Read a lot of reviews about issues with the picture and cheaper feeling materials, didn't find those with this; picture was fine, the foam that pads it on your face feels exactly the same as the first gen to me, though the little speaker things are terrible. The controllers work well, I like the 360 view feature, couldn't do that with the first gen. Only things I would change, ditch the earphone things (if you're a real gamer, you'll have a good headset already and it works well with one, center head strap starts to hurt after a while, though), move the center strap attachment farther forward on the screen shell so there's less weight on your cheekbones, make the screen 1080p (small words and numbers up close start to blur, elite dangerous people know what I'm talking about), make more room for those of us that wear glasses. My glasses are within the prescribed dimension limits Oculus gives, but they are still smashed to my face if I try to wear them, will have to try their prescription lense adapter as wearing contacts (for me) gets irritating. Latency from headset or touch controller movement to screen response is so minuscule only a computer could see it. In the end, a fantastic device and well worth the price.

Do not expect satisfaction if you deal with oculusvr/support.  Two weeks ago I contacted oculusvr/support with the following request:Feb 5, 2:51 PM PST - ""I have never been able to use my Oculus Rift since purchase. I asked my son (who works at Google X) to figure out the problem. He advised that the top left rail of the HDMI plug is bent out of place causing the software not to recognize the headset. I need a new cable!""That simple request has led to HOURS of time wasted in sending emails, photos, part numbers, proof of purchase, etc. back and forth with oculusvr/support.  Two weeks later still no resolution.  If you have a problem work with amazon.com for satisfaction.  oculusvr/support does not know what support means!  When a customer spends about $400.00 for a product that NEVER worked it should not be necessary to BEG for assistance... especially a defective cable!  Do not expect satisfaction if you deal with oculusvr/support!March 2018  I finally received a replacement cable and the Oculus software still will not recognize the headset. I still feel that I have wasted $400.00 with nothing to show for it but a pile of wires and a USELESS headset. I spent hours trying to get it to work but the software does not recognize the headset. My computer expert son was unable to get the headset to work with the new cable and gave up after several hours.  I am not a new to working with computers... I have been assembling my own computer systems long before the Pentium was introduced. The Oculus cable is not a standard cable one can purchase at a local computer store. It is unique to Oculus in that it has two input jacks, an HDMI and an USB and only one output jack into the headset.  I stand by the ONE STAR rating I gave Oculus and wish Amazon would allow ZERO STARS for companies that provide defective equipment to purchasers. Do not waste your time or money with Oculus!

Rift is the most cost effective hardware to actually dive into VR. For the price the Rift graphics capabilities is not the different than Vive and very importantly for me is the application. Vive with SteamVR really needs a full size room and the boundary system will confine and limit you if not. I like the Oculus app as it allows me more freedom instead of telling me what I should be doing. I use half my room space which sets it as medium space and Oculus is fine with that especially it's boundary system which I can ignore if need be. Plus I use my Rift on the opposite side of my monitors so I can better utilize my space without having to move my chair or change my furniture. I can sit down and use my headset and gamepad without caring about my sensors which is pointed to the other direction. Vive and SteamVR chokes if I try to do this and main reason why I buy most of my games with the Oculus app instead of Steam. If Oculus allows for sharing of apps in household and allowing multiple profiles then that would kick Steam in needed capabilities. Like in Superhot VR, I have to reset progress so others have have a better playing experience.

Seeing your hands react in a simi-realistic way in-game is the mind blowing, and any of the games worth playing on the rift require the touch anyways.

Wow. I knew this would be fun but it exceeded my expectations for sure. It is such an immersive experience, I honestly did not think it would be this cool.There are a couple problems I see. One the headset seems to get hot after a short while of playing, after 10 minutes or so my face starts to get relatively uncomfortable. I've played max for 20 minutes at a time and it did not really get much worse, but steadily stayed at the same level. Once you take off the headset you can definitely feel it though as cool air hits your face. 2) While not necessarily a problem with the console itself, the games are all so short. Is there a true VR game that is longer than 6-7 hours long? They are great while they last, but so short.The controllers are really cool as well. You can point and it will show this in game. They also feel nice in your hands, unique controllers for sure.I really hope some longer games come out soon and that Oculus keeps supporting the Rift. My biggest worry is with their ""1 billion VR users"" goal and the release of the oculus go, I feel they might start to focus more on that system and not try to push the boundaries in graphics, etc.This headset takes quite a system to run. I feel a lot of people who get dizzy maybe don't have enough of a system to run this. I got dizzy only one time so far and it was strange, felt like vertigo, when Robo Recall glitched/lagged for a second. I have a 1060, i5-6600, 16 GB RAM, and SSD, nothing too crazy, but a decent ways off from minimum specs.

After trying out a HTC Vive at a Gamestop, I knew I was eventually going to be buying a VR system.  The $799 price tag was a bit steep for me though, so I figured I would need to wait a bit.  I was already planning to upgrade my graphics card and snagged a GTX 1070 for a good price, and along came this summer sale for the touch bundle for Oculus.  I was wanting more out of my flight simulators, and after watching videos and reading reviews, I figured I would order.Setup was pretty straight forward, with the headset requiring an HDMI port and a USB 3.0 port, and one sensor needing a USB 3.0 port, while the other can be on USB 2.0.  I initially had both sensors set up in the front of my desk, and it worked pretty well, but I decided to go for a 2 sensor room scale setup, mounting each sensor in opposing corners of my room, on the ceiling.  I did so and have no complaints.  I may get a 3rd sensor later to clean up any rough areas where I sometimes lose tracking, but it's more than adequate right now.So how does it perform?  Like a dream.  For my original intended purpose of flight sims, it is spectacular.  Apart from using a full motion platform, this is the most immersive thing you could do for a flight sim.  You get a sense of position within the aircraft, which also helps give a sense of position of the aircraft, which is extremely useful for me flying helicopters.  The first time I picked up in the Huey in DCS:World, I felt the same butterflies in my stomach I get when I ride in a real helicopter.  Watching the ground drift away from you is amazing.  Looking down and really seeing the depth of everything.Now, obviously I wasn't going to constrain myself to only using the Rift for flight sims, so I have been playing around with different games, both free, and some that I have purchased.  The introductory demo for Oculus was actually pretty fantastic, with quite a bit to mess around with.  Lucky's Tale takes a platformer a la Mario 64, and puts you right above the action, able to move around it freely.  It really shows how VR can be utilized to enhance more traditional games, rather than just for first person experiences.  Robo Recall amps up the action, and makes you feel like you are in a twist between iRobot, the new Total Recall, and The Matrix.  The sense of presence, and the physics make the game a blast to play.  Last, I picked up Onward and Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades to have some gun play.  Onward is great, and really put me in the game.  Having to actually reload your weapon rather than just pressing ""X"" adds to the tension, especially when you are running a machine gun that requires a bit more work to reload.  Being able to duck (or even go prone) behind cover, or lean around corners and doors, made everything feel intuitive, though the locomotion controls take a little while to get used to, and cause a little vertigo at first.All in all, I am really happy with this purchase.  Yes, there is some screen door effect, but that is going to be there with any of the current VR headsets.  I doubt it will change much until we have HMD's with a higher pixel per inch count and resolution, which will undoubtedly require more powerful hardware to run.  So this is the perfect point to jump in and see if you are going to enjoy VR.

I owned the Oculus Rift for many months before investing in Oculus Touch. While I was impressed by a small number of games, there was no denying that the lack of direct interaction meant that I was only getting half the experience.Now that I have Oculus Touch, that's no longer the case.Oculus Touch is a must-have for any Oculus Rift owner. It transforms the way you play in ways that are fundamentally important. You can feel what it's like to hold a gun in an arcade shooter, or pick up objects in an RPG.I should mention that I previously owned HTC Vive but sold it after learning of a few of its shortcomings. While I very much enjoyed HTC Vive's motion controls, Oculus Touch is on a whole different level. They feel better in the hands, have unique interactions that developers can take advantage of, and have better build quality.

As other's have said, the Touch is the rare gen-1 product that achieves near-perfection in it's stated goals.  Simply put, it's a must-have addition to the Rift headset.  Hand (and finger!) tracking is millimeter-perfect.  Your hands appear in the VR realm in the same position as your real-hands, and the position and movement is basically instantaneous and very, very smooth.The computing power and alogorithms behind this tech are jaw-dropping, but you don't have to worry about any of that.  It simply works, and well.  With the excellent Rift headset, I found I was deeply immersed in incredible environs, with enough feedback to fool my brain unlike any video game ever has.  Climbing huge walls in the Grand Canyon, casting spells with intricate hand movements in gritty urban settings, dropping a 3 over a trash-talking opponent, or reloading my six shooter in a knock-out brawl were all experiences I had in the first few hours of using the Touch.This is a breakthrough product, and really does deserve the hype you've heard.  It's rare that electronic entertainment makes this kind of leap.  The original Nintendo, the DVD, and video streaming all changed the way we spend our leisure hours.  Now, VR joins the list.  And the Oculus Rift + Touch is the best-of-the-best in these first generation systems.  If you've not experienced this level of VR, you're in for a treat.  Yes, go ahead and upgrade your PC to handle this beast.  You'll become part of the next great advance in home tech.

Update 14.01.2018Overall this helmet is not as bad as the first;) I like this helmet. But I put 4 stars, as the first failed, but this is not ideal.Update! 11.01.2018Got a helmet on the replacement, since the first one turned out to be a problem.And what do you think, the second helmet has the same problem, only now with the right screen! I want to ask the manufacturer, do you have a conscience? Sell goods of poor quality. It turns out that both helmets contain defects, since the first problem is in the left display, and the second one in the right, so it's not so conceived, but an accidental coincidence.It is a pity that there is no way to contact Mark Zuckerberg, he would not appreciate such work of his employees.Eventually! I overpaid for sending goods that were sent for replacement, and he, too, with a defect.I am the first of my many friends who decided on such a purchase, they know about the problem with which I have encountered and will definitely not buy this product, because it is of poor quality (effect Mura oled matrix).The goods pleased exactly one day. On the second day, the left display began to distort the color. Instead of dark gray (almost black), began to display light gray-green. And on a clean black background, appeared greenish artifacts in the left display. As a result, there is a feeling of discomfort.The right display does not have any complaints.Very long dreamed of the helmet of BP, as a result, I bought this model. And very disappointed. So, after the appearance of this problem, I started looking for information in the GUGLE and found out that this problem occurs quite often. As a result, due to poor quality, I am suffering losses due to the delivery of the helmet back to Amazon. And this is about 25% of the cost of the goods.

The sensor works great - I picked up as a fourth sensor for my environment.  The only issue I had with this sensor is that the repeater cable it comes with, seems to have some kind of a weird issue.  The computer sees it as an unknown device, and won't actually connect to whatever I plug into the repeater cable.  Tried it on both USB 2 and USB 3 ports, and tried it on a number of my sensors, not just the new one, and the cable seems to be DOA.  I happened to pick up 2 USB 3 cables that I was planning on using for the two front sensors, but ended up not needing to use the extensions cables, so this worked for now (the fourth and third sensors are hooked up to a second USB controller, using USB 2, and I have no tracking issues).  Beyond the cable issues though, the sensor is great and have nothing bad to add!

Ive had nothing but issues since I got this thing. started out with the sensors not working, then somehow all the usb ports i had sensors and the headset connected to on my motherboard stopped working (still dont after 2 weeks), bought a usb PCIe card for my pc, and managed to get the system running on that. It ran good for about a week, now the audio cuts out about 10 mins after starting the oculus software, while waiting on oculus support to respond to my support ticket for that issue, the controllers stopped working, until i completely uninstalled and reinstalled the oculus software, which fixed that (but not the audio issue). Honestly im not sure if oculus is entirely to blame of if windows is contributing to the issues, but either way oculus support has yet to respond to me, and now im looking at a $400 paper weight

Pros:If you haven't tried VR before like in my case and you bought the Oculus + Touch bundle with a 3rd sensor, prepare to have your mind blown. Tracking  is flawless, you really feel like your hands are in VR with you. There is not much else to say about Oculus other than it is amazing, totally worth every cent.To be honest, I did not believe technology was at this level yet until I popped this thing on and you won't too if you've never tried VR before.Cons:My Oculus headset came with a defective left earphone , which was very disappointing, -1 star.Like you have probably seen before in various reviews, the resolution is not gonna be 1080p. However, the VR experience makes up for that in how immersive the environment is and you forget about the barely noticeable pixels on the screen once you've adjusted your lens and headset to a comfortable setting.

I thought I had experienced VR with the Gear but my first 15 minutes in the Rift with Touch showed me that I hadn't seen anything yet. I finally understood what people meant when they said it felt like you were in some distant world or place. Touch just makes it so much more incredible than without...Unfortunately it only took about 3 seconds for my face to start sweating so after 15 minutes of use I removed it and now have to clean the sweat stained lenses but apart from that it is awesome! The touch controller, however great they are, they definitely make it hard to stick your finger up along your nose to scratch an itch XDThe only real problem with the Rift is one that has been mentioned a number of times elsewhere... you get 2 sensors with the kit but unless you plan on placing them on your desk the cable is just too short for the one that goes the furthest from your PC. It severely limits where you can place the sensor and in my case determined where I had to place my wall mounts. My desk is too full and the cable is just too short to keep things tidy. I definitely recommend you get 1 USB3 extension cable when you buy this.The amount of free content on offer was staggering to say the least and when I went back into the app later on I found that there are even more now than there was before. I have over 50 titles so far and have yet to spend $0.01 on buying anythingI actually wanted the Vive but decided to go with the Rift when I watched the keynote and saw the new Home includes Dash which allows you to run your windows apps in VR but arranged so much better than Windows Home where you have to travel through the virtual space to get to your apps. They keynote said that update would be available for free in December. Imagine my surprise when I put on the headset and went to the store and found 3 free apps that all do exactly that already...Definitely happy with my purchase. Oh, and a word on shipping... a padded box inside a padded box to keep my foam encased products safe... the box I received was almost double the size of the products box. Excellent packaging.

If you own an Oculus Rift and you play games that'd benefit from 360 degree tracking (Onward, Robo Recall, GORN, basically any game where you're in the middle of the action), a third sensor is a fantastic addition. I had previously used 2-sensor tracking (sensors on opposite sides of each other) but still had some jitteriness where the sensors didn't overlap. By adding this guy and setting it straight in the back (so the sensors were at equal angles away from each other) I had perfect 360 degree tracking. Not only that, but if one of the sensors got moved for whatever reason, the system compensated for it much more easily. It's a lot easier to play games developed for 360 degree systems now!

This sensor makes using the oculus wonderful. No longer have to worry about losing tracking when I turn around. I have a PSVR and the hardest part is trying to stay facing the camera. With this sensor for oculus, there's no issue when you turn around. These sensors also have a very wide sensing range, despite the size of the face. Only downside is that the oculus setup wants a very sharp left or right angle during setup, meaning one side doesn't necessarily get the coverage you want (it wants somewhat of a right triangle setup instead of an equalateral setup), but that is more of the program forcing that, not the sensor. Also bonus points because when I ordered the sensor, it came with a 10 foot USB extension.

Words cannot express how amazing the VR experience is with this model. After playing a friend's Rift for just a few minutes I had to own one, that's how compelling it was to me, and I bought my first gaming system in about 13 years to drive it. Both me and my son (age 8) love the Rift and the games you can play on it. If you consider yourself a gamer at any level, you have to try one sometime and when you do you'll probably come here and buy it. I would recommend purchasing the additional sensor (it comes with two in the box) for a total of three and running roomscale if you have the space. The free game Robo Recall is the most immersive first person shooter I've played in my life. Arizona Sunshine (FPS zombie game) is the scariest zombie game I've ever played. The Rift will take you to space to visit the international space station, or fly around the world in Google Earth VR. If you're wondering how good VR technology is today - it is absolutely here - today. The Rift is a great entry level VR that I would recommend in a heartbeat. It will work on a GeForce GTX 1060, but I really recommend the GTX 1070 to drive it for a flawless experience.

The Oculus Rift is an awesome accessory for any mid/high end GPU.  The immersion is as good as you have heard.  But (and this is a big BUT), the eye fatigue is a real issue.  You are not going to marathon game in this.  My eyes were dead tired in less than an hour.  The headset can get hot fast and you might start sweating on your face.  It's a great experience and the game immersion is awesome.  Just keep in mind comfort and fatigue are and issue.

Update on review 9/14/2017After a month of use I can say definitively that this device feels like a beta version of something better. The screen door effect is horrific, it's 2017, my phone has better resolution.  The games all feel arcade style and cheap. The blurriness is just unbearable after a certain while of gameplay, it really makes me feel like vomiting. This device isn't ready for mainstream yet, feels like something one tries once in life but never looks back at it again. Not with the buy until next gen versions are released. My two cents!Just set up the head set! It took me about 15 minutes to get the wires connected, 2 sensors calibrated and headset adjusted.  I didn't have to create a Facebook account like the previous reviewer stated. I created an oculus account to sign into my games and oculus portal. Super easy, if anyone is having a hard time they lack common sense.Make sure you have at least 3 USB 3.0 connections on your pc and an HDMI connection to your Graphics card. You have to have an internet connection to download the Oculus software online, as it does not come with any type of CD rom.Visit the Oculus website to get started as there is no documentation directing consumers to the website for setup. I had to search the web a bit to figure it out.  Download the Application and it will walk you through the whole set up process.Very simple, the only gripe I have is the six free games aren't available for free in the oculus portal. The bundle is supposed to include  these games automatically, I don't know if this is a registration fluke or a common Issue. Make sure you receive your free games.Regardless, this is absolutely an awesome experience. I will revise my review as I tinker with it more.9/3/2017The six games that were bundled with Oculus showed up on my dashboard as purchased the next morning.  The games look great and it's a truly immersive experience. So, I did get the six free games.Two issues I've noticed about the rift is no matter how I adjust the headset there seems to be blurry areas in the field of view. The blurry areas aren't as noticeable when playing games, but when reading text its better to move the head unit to the direction of the text so it comes into focus. Your eyes alone cannot adjust for focus unless the head unit is facing that direction.The second issue I've come across is the screen door effect that many people notice while using the Oculus Rift. It's essentially your eyes being able to pick up the spacing between individual pixels on the OLED displays in the head unit. To get an idea of what I'm talking about, walk up to your TV and stare at the screen, you'll be able to see the individual pixels on screen. Keep in mind my TV is 60 inches, so its easier to see individual pixels on my 1080p TV. In order to fix this problem Oculus would have to modify the displays to a higher resolution OLED display, which would in turn require 800 dollar Graphic cards, (not economical now).  Maybe in a few year newer tech will drop in price for this move to be made.I still like the unit and would recommend the purchase, just make sure you have a descent Graphic card in your PC. AMD rx480 or rx580 would work great for most games. As of this posting, most AMD GPU's have inflated prices, wait for stock to increase and purchase at MSRP.

I am anticipating good things, in spite of minimum specs...will update.  This aside, I'm writing this for a heads up.  My husband walked by me carrying a box the other day.  He looked up and said, expressionless, ""Your mother's Oculus Rift is here"" and went on to deliver it to her.  Here I thought I was being clever by having it sent in her name.  :|  My mother is in her 70s and prefers mystery novels.  Clearly the surprise was foiled.  So if you just bought this for someone for Christmas it may come super fast unexpectedly and have ""Oculus"" written on the label on the box...run, track, find and hide that puppy.Quick revised update, March 2018:  He was very, very happy, though we did end up upgrading the computer quite a bit (ouch) and we added the extra sensor.  Most importantly, though, he has thoroughly enjoyed his new VR world (and unintended new computer :I), in spite of the limited game content (there are just so many fun ones out there, but they aren't huge like most of us are used to).  That being said, there is still much joy to be found in this limited world AND then there is Elite Dangerous, the go-to VR game, it seems.  This game feels limitless!  It is set in space, after all.I did manage to surprise him with the Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS HOTAS Controller and the recommended Voice Attack at the hcsvoicepacks site, which have been well worth it!  At first he was skeptical of the need for any of it, but then later I found him sitting at a small table in the middle of the room facing an empty wall, away from the computer, looking up toward the ceiling.  Fortunately, his VR headset was on or I'd have been a little concerned, though I admit it did make me chuckle on the inside.  To me, with my husband, sitting at that table that I haven't seen in years, that he must have dug through lots of storage to find, says a lot.  It had only the controller resting on it.  On the monitor he was flying through space.  Many hours later he appeared to me.  I suppose space commanders have to sleep, too.

This is simply a must have for 360 degree tracking. I used a two sensor setup for a month, and could always tell when I got turned around. Tracking would spaz out and I'd watch my hands float away. Not anymore. The sensor is easy to set up, and the included cable works great to get the placement right.

I first tested HTC VIVE for 4 weeks and returned it as it's way too expensive and I just didn't like that blurry image even though it has a wider FOV. Besides you need(or you should) extra stands to set them up which means another $46.Occulus has slightly narrower FOV but the display is much sharper and I loved it. If you don't care about 360-degree play you don't need a 3rd sensor otherwise with a 3rd one it becomes very accurate and much fun to play. So, it's debatable whether Occulus is better than VIVE or vice versa, for me yes, I'd prefer sharper image. Besides, there's NO way you should pay another $300 for HTC, it is NOT worth it.These VR sets are still evolving their v2 will probably much better. Occulus WILL do, the way it is.

I bought it because I had a bunch of amazon gift cards to turn in so it cost me $16 out of pocket.  I thought it would be a gimmick at best.  I was wrong. Paired with my laptop that has a I7 7820k and GTX1080, this is the most intense gaming experience I've ever had.  Playing ""Robo Recall"" is an adrenaline rush and the level of detail is unbelievable.  You forget about real life when you are immersed in VR.  Also played Skyrim with the VorpX driver and it becomes a whole new game (after tweaking the settings of course). For $349 (comes with headset, 2 sensors, controllers) this is well worth the price.  It will change your gaming experience. Also, so great boxing games that really make you break a sweat and good for practice

They have a standard refund policy which allows 2 hours of gameplay. I played for barely over 2 hours, asked for a refund, and my request was denied. Seriously very stingy.Also while there are great Vr games, even the best ones feel half finished and buggy. Most of them don't have much content. Also the graphics are low, and system requirements are high.Don't get me wrong, I don't regret buying it, but they have a long way to come.

My most recent e-mailIt appears as though there may be no resolution to the issues I'm having with the Oculus rift, which render the product useless.  Therefore I am requesting a phone number to speak with a support person to resolve these issues or  an RMA number that I may use to return the Rift for a full refund.To summarize the problems:1.  Unable to download games from  Oculus via the Oculus app2.  Third party games (purchased on dvd) work with external display w/o issue, but the oculus display halts and displays an oculus menu within the headset. The external display continues properly.  To re-enable the Oculus Rift display, a complete restart of Oculus and the third party software is required.3.  Third party games (purchased from SteamVR) start normally in Oculus rift, but terminate after a few minutes and require restart, and resume w/o restarting oculus.Efforts to resolve this issue to  point.:We have been using chat and e-mail sessions for 4 days (starting on 10/13/2018) with no progress or change in the status or any anticipated resolution date.10/13/2018We encountered issues with downloading Oculus software and opened a problem ticket.Opened a chat session and e-mail session with tech support team members Lloyd and Peter.Provided detailed system log files to the Oculus support teamI was asked to wait a couple of days for possible resolution.10/16/2018 -Checking the status of the problem tickets, one appeared to be ""resolved""Opened a chat session and was advised Oculus is experiencing a large volume of calls, indicating a widespread problem.Chat Log from 10/16/2018:(03:46:40 PM) Ezekiel: It does appear that everything that could be done via chat was covered though, so there isn't anything else I can suggest to you. All I can suggest is waiting for us to get back to you via email, as we are investigating, but if you have anything that you'd like me to add to the ticket before taking this back to email then please let me know.(03:48:48 PM) Richard: Yes.. It has been a few days, with no progress. I would like to get an RMA to return the rift. if the problem can be resolved before tomorrow... I'd be delighted, but my confidence to this point is shaken. I'm not pleased with this outcome, but I need to try the HTC.(03:50:54 PM) Ezekiel: I am sorry that we have yet to get back to you Richard, we have been experiencing high ticket volumes over the past week, we typically will get back to you within 1 to 2 business days once it has been sent to email for investigation.(03:51:43 PM) Ezekiel: Now, as for the RMA part, that is not my call, but I will add that as a note to ticket 614589 when I update the ticket(03:52:24 PM) Richard: Please send me the contact info I need to discuss an RMA.(03:54:53 PM) Ezekiel: I don't have any contact info to provide to you Richard, as there isn't a RMA specific point of contact, but I have added said note to your active ticket (613376).(03:55:25 PM) Ezekiel: You could also reach out via ticket 613376 with your RMA request as well.

I hadn't done much research on VR and bought it only after a friend mentioned they bought one (Always was one for bad decisions so thought why not?) Main videos i had seen of VR were the army simulator games with the clunky graphics so that's what I was expecting. Boy was I surprised to find out it was actually great graphics and pretty decent gameplay. I can't play it for more than an hour or two but it's an hour or two of being completely engrossed in whatever game or environment I'm playing in. I will say I bought it without thinking about my glasses. The headset isn't extremely glasses friendly. You need a smaller pair of glasses and even then it's going to be pretty close to the internal glass of the headset. I also found the internal glass will fog up unless the room of your house is above 75ish. Most of that is due to the headset pushing down over your nose forcing air back up onto the glass. It's minor in the long run tho. Great buy and don't regret it. Been having alot of fun with friends and family.

I actually enjoy the Rift quite a lot but there are some issues to be aware of beyond technical problems (not including or sickness, which I'll cover later).The Rift itself is made with quality and there really doesn't appear to be anything terribly cheap about any of it. Even the headphones that come with it are pretty nice. The touche controls are very comfortable and responsive. All in all, it works very well. I have not had issues with sensors (I bought a 3rd sensor which pretty makes that go away). And as far as motion sickness, that's just common with intense VR games, the fault isn't the Rift, it;s our own senses not handling VR well - simply put, don't play games rated as ""intense.""My issues may not be specifically Rift related, but they're very real issues that prevent me from enjoying it.1. The screen-door effect. Seriously, what's up with the graphics? Many games are grainy, and the headset itself give them that effect like you're looking through a screen door. That's a huge letdown.2. Very, very few quality games are out right now for VR. I tried several, and returned several. Most of them suck, or have been adapted For VR and just don't function right. A lot of what's out now isn't made by AAA studios so there are a lot of games with cutsey-kiddie graphics.3. Damn headset gets itchy, itchy itchy. I dunno but my nose is always so itchy, it's like the foam just makes me wanna scratch, which really breaks immersion.4. They don't have many reliable ways for movement that don't induce motion sickness so you stand in place spinning in circles. What's wrong with that? Spinning in circles means that darn cord isn't as easy to avoid as you might think. Yes, there are ways to hang it overhead, but I don't want to go drilling holes or attaching stuff to my walls and damage the paint. I've found myself tangled up from spinning around more times than I can remember.All in all, the product itself is excellent. All 3 stars are for the product. But I will likely refund the Rift, as much as I like it, it doesn't have the support of solid graphics in many games, and what games are out there just look like they're made for kids, in an attempt to hide the poor graphics and/or studio quality. They're definitely on to something, but it has a long way to go.

You must  understand VR is still very new, and when it works (40-50%) of the time its really cool.. with that said the frustration of constantly re-calibrating the sensors gets really old. They still need to get the bugs worked out. DO NOT go and buy a bunch of games until you are 100% sure everything works, as I can promise you will be even more mad that you spent $50 on a game that constantly flickers or crashes. All you have to do is a google search on Oculus Sensor issues and you will see it happens to most all users. I hope they get this figured out someday as its amazing to be in a virtual space.

Works an absolute treat and now having 3 sensors it's really good. 2 does work very well but the third has a really noticble effect covering areas that would have slight judders at times!

Summary review:At $400, for gamers that aren't struggling to pay bills this is an awesome purchase!Setup and use was simple and the learning curve to the touch controllers almost intuitive. Fully comfortable headset even with neck issues. And the immersion is shocking.Though, probably NOT a great gift for your na-na that prefers playing Bridge over AAA PC games.Full review:I started on the Atari 2600 circa 198x. From there I followed as close as I could afford to gaming tech. Atari 5200, Nintendo, Genesis, Game Gear, Saturn, N64, Dreamcast, PS1, Xbox, PS2, Xbox360, PS3, 3DS; Commodore 64, 386, 486, 486 (with Turbo!!!,) dual, quad, hexa, octa-core and all peripherals needed. These let me feel like I was playing a video game and real life was right beside me.I held out on VR only because I couldn't justify spending more than my first car on hardware with a nearly singular function. With that I can't compare the Oculus against the Vive, VPL Tech (see Lawnmower Man,) or anything between. (except Google Cardboard which is a neat experience, but shouldn't be included in the same conversation.) I also couldn't see myself buying something from Facebook over a company whose primary focus is hardware tech. Then, after the recent Summer sale, I couldn't see myself spending twice as much on equally compared products.So I got the Oculus, and found immersion I haven't experienced in my 30+ years of gaming. There have been moments I had to pull away only to catch my bearings. Knowing intellectually that I'm looking at a computer generated world, yet feeling my palms sweat looking over the edge of a multi-story building.It still feels like studio's are only exploring the capabilities and limitations of VR. But with a strong sense that the games and applications out now are only a hint of what's to come.For supporting hardware I'm running this on MSI x370 mb, AMD Ryzen 1700 modestly OC'd to 3400, 1x Evga GeForce 970 4gb, Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB DDR4 3000MHz (with BIOS issues on bringing it down to 2300mhz). So far I've seen zero stutters, low FPS or tracking issues.If you're considering getting into VR, all things considered the Oculus is currently the best choice.

I run a university lab for emerging technology. We have been experimenting with Vive, HoloLens and Oculus in the VR/AR/MR space. All three are pretty great (though Oculus and Vive are far more complete products than HoloLens, which is a different kettle of bits), but the Vive was emerging as the consensus winner, mostly because the controls were better. The Touch controllers changed the game, with the Oculus now perceived as the clear winner at this time. These controllers are essential for the Rift. They enhance the experience significantly. The action is very natural and the ""hands"" give you an anchor point in VR which I find helpful in reducing motion sickness, which is an issue for me. Despite how awesome it is this technology is still fairly primitive- we liken the current state of the technology to the ""suitcase cell phone"" of the 70's- clunky and cumbersome, but so compelling that it's worth dealing with the limitations. Coming innovations such as wireless headsets, smaller headsets, and real-time feedback- see Occipital's Bridge for an early example- along with higher resolution will have this technology wowing us for years to come!

As we speak my wife is playing ""The Lab"" and she's got a bow and arrow shooting a whole lot of people that look like the AOL guy as they try to sack a castle.We've been playing Fruit Ninja.

Got the third sensor for the 360 tracking and I have to say it has vastly improved the experience in VR. So much so that the original kit should just come with three or 4. It was a bit tricky to setup as my play area is an awkward shape and they are very specific about where the sensor should be placed. After completing setup, I found you can be a bit more flexible with where the sensor sits and it still works great. I recommend a third sensor to anyone who has touch.

If you are contemplating buying a third sensor just do it. It's definitely worth it. I bought a third and then 4th. I have an Asus X99 deluxe U/3.1 motherboard with 2 USB 3.1 pci cards so I have a ton of USB ports. You have to make sure you have enough bandwidth to handle 4 but 3 should be fine if you have limited USB ports if you use your USB 2.0 port instead. I had to buy 2 USB 3.0 extensions because it only comes with USB 2.0. Probably not a huge issue but I wanted to make sure there were no issues with lag or latency and USB 2.0 is slow in comparison.

An absolute must for the Oculus rift, and way overpriced as a result. Combined with an Oculus this will cost you about as much as the superior HTC vive which is bundled with a similar controller, so just go for that instead.Or better yet, wait a generation or two for them to sort out the low resolution and persistent screen door effect.

I really liked the VR when I first got it.  Shipped quickly.  Not too bad to set up if you just follow the instructions.  But the system is very glitchy.  I bought a brand new gaming PC and have put nothing on it except VR.  Games fail to start.  Have to unplug and replug the headset in.  Games are fine one minute and the jerky the next.I was putting up with all that because its still fun, but after 2 months, a button quit working on the left controller and the trigger got sticky on the other.  I contacted Oculus support.  Took several days to respond and when the did, they made me get them a bunch of information like error logs, serial numbers, etc.  Took like 20 minutes.  Then days went by, and the asked me to take a video of a game in action and demonstrate that it didn't work.  Try to do that with a cell camera to show what your fingers are doing while looking through the headset and trying to show on the screen what's going on at the same time.  They also wanted pictures of the serial numbers.  Why do they need all this?  They have my registration.  And why didn't the ask several days ago with the other info.Here's where it gets really petty and frustration.  After two weeks, they say they will send me refurbished controllers despite mine were only 2 months old.  I complained.  They said too bad, the fine print in the warranty says they send refurbished.  And they guaranteed it would be be indistinguishable from new.  So I put them in a box (no choice anyway) and sent them off.What did I get in return now on week 3?  ONE controller, not two.  And it looked like the previous user was eating pizza in between games and then not washing his hands.  It was greasy and full of crumbs.  Hardly indistinguishable from new!  So I write back asking where my other replacement is.  Days go by. They ask for my address, tracking number, etc. again as though they've never heard of me and have no record of my issue.  I give them this info, days go by, and they ask for more information.  I look it up on THEIR system, put it in an email and sent it to them.  I keep getting notes saying ""thank you for your patience, you're issue will be handled in the order it was received."" NO, its not being handled in that order!  I keep going to the end of the line.A month later, I finally get a second controller after pleading with them to just put one in a stinkin' box and send it to me.In summary, your money will gladly be taken upfront to buy a new system.  It will probably be glitchy, but its still fun.  God help your patience if you have to deal with support.  Its very petty and unethical they way they treat a customer who just bought a brand new system.

I recommend buying the third sensor so you can have room scale VR. It's much nicer. Check out Lone Echo. It's a perfect space sim/adventure game. Well worth the money. Also, I have a neck injury so this being significantly lighter than the HTC Vibe is a huge for me.Very pleased.

These sensors are cheap and effective, and they come with all the usb extension you will need. If you are like me, then the 2 sensors that came with the headset and touch kits will give you a solid front end for your setup, I run 4 sensors with my own setup and the ability to face any direction with accuracy is fantastic, its the thing besides the level of detail that makes a PC setup far superior to a PSVR. Even at spending almost 550 on putting together my setup is still cheaper and just as effective as HTC's setup with the exception of wireless sensors. not worth the additional expense for the same gosh darn thing to me.

The first time stepping into VR in Oculus is such a memorable experience! I literally squealed from excitement being transported into another world, seeing my hands and fingers replicated in the VR world and then interacting realistically with objects in your environment is a downright joy to behold. I absolutely love the Oculus and don't regret buying it at all over the HTC Vive (more expensive) and Windows Mixed Reality (less expensive, but currently less supported by developers).My only complaint is that the right headphone stopped working. I used the included Oculus screwdriver to gently tighten/loosen the right headphone and the sound came back, but it intermittently cuts out and it has gotten worse over time. I suspect a bad wiring connection so I am returning my set for a replacement. Hopefully there will be no issues with the replacement.*UPDATE* I received the new Rift which has been working for several months without any issues at all. It's sturdy and built like a tank--I don't know how many times I've hit the headset with the controllers or run into something LOL, but keeps working with no issues. I'm revising my rating to 5 stars, I LOVE the rift!

The headset is the heaviest and most cumbersomeOcculus has a polished library more stable os, hand gesture with touch, lightest of the sets and until the 3rd sensor was lacking in room scale. The only gripe I have with occulus is although their content is great why some titles are exclusive to each other sucks. The other thing no way glasses are fitting inside the headset, smaller area.

Sensor did not come with USB extension, as advertised.  Created an Oculus ticket and was informed that it's an Amazon issue.  I can't imagine Amazon helping since the USB extension was never mentioned in the Product Description - only the Q&A and Reviews.  So... meh.[Update 8/21] Support at Oculus was exemplary and shipped me out the missing USB extension at no cost to me.  Bravo to them!

I can't recommend this at this time.  With the default settings the image as a fixed pattern noise at low light levels.  This is best seen in the IPD calibration tool or the lost demo.  It is possible to correct this using a registry key (search for usespud=0 - there are large reddit posts about this).  This removes the noise.  For me the noise was like varying random grey transparent specks.  For others it is green.  The reg key above may introduce other issues (red tint or more god rays) on my unit it did not seem to.  However give the registry key is unsupported. Plus their support teams are not taking anyone seriously who reports this - i have spent a month sending mails back and forth with oculus I am left in a situation where i cannot recommend due this issue and their poor support.  To be clear this issue is because they are not correcting for mura correctly.  Turning off the correction actually improves the display.  However at any time oculus could remove this reg key and we would be left SOL.This issue, should not be confused with the screen door effect - this is a uniform pattern caused by the gaps between pixels being visible, while present in bright scenes it is IMO minimal and is non-intrusive.  This incorrect MURA correction results in a non uniform pattern, that is different in each eye, visible in darker scenes.  The difference in eyes can cause motion sickness for some.On the upside the controllers are absolutely fantastic (better than the MS mixed reality ones i have played with)  and i was more than impressed by the experiences, the tutorial demo is one of the best i have seen, the new integration with steam is great.  For now i am going to wait to v2 when the have ironed out their issues and the product and support practices have become more mature.  (oh and one again thanks for amazon return process and policies - easy and awesome!)

Buy this at your own risk.  If you can keep this thing running it is a pretty cool novelty but it is a very buggy application and piece of hardware.  Any update by Oculus or Nvidia or Windows can crash this and make it unusable.  There is no support from Oculus.  Its all email based and very slow. You cannot talk to anyone and they will give you only basic trouble shooting. Third sensors are a nightmare for keeping connected as well as the Headset and blank screen issues.  Check their forums, they have rampant problems with this item.  If your thinking about VR I would very sincerely think about waiting until new and better systems become available with much better support for both the software and customer service.  I will never buy another Oculus product and will likely wait for something from Sony or Microsoft that is worth it.

J'ai mis 2 étoiles seulement car c'est un produit qui possède encore beaucoup de défauts techniques pour ce prix là.- Gros manque de résolution au niveau de l'écran, on voit beaucoup trop les pixels.- Les capteurs avec des câbles trop court donc il faut prévoir des rallonges USB avec amplificateur pour bien les positionner à l'opposer l'un de l'autre et avoir un bon roomscale.- Gros gros manque de contenu sur Steam ce qui en fait plus un gadget qu'on va utiliser au début et puis après plus rien. Etant fan des grosses licences comme Batman Arkham VR, 90% des jeux proposé sur Steam sont des jeux indé qu'il faut payer pour au final être déçu, bref le contenu est grave manquant et aussi en qualité, d'un côté c'est normal c'est le début.Autrement la qualité du produit en lui même est excellent, le packaging est excellent rien à redire, les finitions nickel, le casque est léger les manettes ont une très bonne prises en mains c'est ni-ckel.Si ils améliorent les défauts cités pour un Oculus Rift 2, même à 1000 euros c'est instant buy.

Works great, but even at $350, I still think it's a bit over priced. My biggest complaint is that I need the Oculus App running to work the device. I just don't like that after I close my game down, I get to see advertisements. WOW! GAMES I DON'T CARE ABOUT!!! WHOOPEE!!!  Also, this thing requires some really beefy hardware to get a comfortable frame rate out of a game like DCS World 1.5. I wouldn't mind the lowered frame rate if the device was cheaper and if I had bought it for $300 or something less.

Let me begin by saying this is one awesome product. I was little hesitant about it, but no matter what I say, unless you actually try it (your nearby Best Buy should have demo) you would not know what you are missing.  I have been gaming for 20 years and lost interest in games like 10 yrs ago. No matter how much I try, I just couldn't get into them. Now for the first time in over a decade, I got lost in the games again! Oh YEAA!!!!  I am just freaking amazed by new upcoming techs and can't wait when version 2 of oculus and whatever touch gloves or stuff it comes out with. I got 32gb ram, i7 , 980gtx and all my games play smoothly without an issue. I do advice people to get a Inateck Superspeed 7 Ports PCI-E to USB 3.0 Expansion Card - Interface USB 3.0 5-Port & 2 Rear USB3.0 Port Express Card Desktop with 15 pin SATA Power Connector [ Include with A 4pin to 2x15pin Cable + A 15pin to 2x 15pin SATA Y-Cable ] adapter.

The hardware and software is stable and it works.You'll need at least one (1) powered USB 2.0 port for a motion sensor and one (1) USB 3.0 port for the headset, in addition to an HDMI port for the headset. Ideally you'd have an extra USB 2.0 port so you can have a total of two (2) sensors for better tracking, but one works fine for sit-down experiences.You'll also need a relatively powerful machine. At least a GTX 980/1060. Each eye in the headset is rendered at around 1080p, so it's the equivalent of a dual-monitor setup in terms of performance requirements. VR games need to run smoothly or else the tracking gets unresponsive and you can get motion sickness, so the standards for framerate are a bit higher (90fps is recommended).VR is awesome. You don't really ""get it"" until you try it out for yourself.

When this works, it is amazing, fun, immersive, and all that other stuff. The other 70% of the time, it's buggy, loses tracking because just enough sunlight is making it through my black out curtains, my left ear piece just descides to stop working, and the sensors decide to not calibrate. I don't know if all the other VR headsets have these same issues, but you really have to be willing to put up with a lot of jank. When it works though.... It really is like nothing else.

The sensor does it's job but it almost feels like Amazon is TRYING to handicap you by sending a USB 2.0 extension cable for a USB 3.0 device. Either they're ignorant to how it all works or they're doing it to be cheap.

I loved the initial experience, 3 sensor room scale is great! However I have 20/20 vision and I feel like a legally blind man in virtual reality. Screen technology and resolution needs vast improvement. Until then I am going to have to hold off. In some games it didn't seem like such a huge deal like in Luckys Tale (Though the screen door/pixilation was still noticeably annoying). Lone Echo was a good game though it really made the screen door effect impossible to overlook (pun intended?) and it stole quite a bit from Halo (which isn't a terable thing really I loved the early Halo games).Bottom line screen tech needs an upgrade, until then I couldn't recommend this for anything but casual short spurts of game play.This being said I am extremely optimistic to what the future of VR and AR will bring and I cannot wait until their is an option for immersive experiences that doesn't make you feel like a legally blind man fumbling around the interwebs.

Was not happy with it. The screendoor effect was worse then I was hoping it would be and the glow effect was really bad. Could not watch bigscreen app that a glow would hit the lens and cover what you were watching, like nails on a chock board. They call it godrays but its not just that... You got god rays that adds a glow to the dark background that is reflecting off a bright object of any kind (text and such) and then you got a glow that reflects on the lens that covers what you are watching/looking at and that's whats annoying. I did get sick playing Luckys Tale but not Robo Recall but oddly I did in other stand still app's but I think the screen door effect plays a big role on motion sickness because I get the same effect when I lookout a screen window and move my head side to side. When I played Luckys Tale I was sick puking for a good full day and that was when I put it back in the box and sealed it... I'm glad I did not buy the Vive.If you are like me or simply picky, do not buy. If you think you may get sick, test it first and play luckys tale and if you can play that and don't care about the other stuff I said then buy but if you do get sick, do not buy, even if it was $100 its still not worth getting sick.

Well worth 99$ price tag. Gaming different with those - keep in mind there is not many games out yet to support those. On negative side those (and rift) both went down in price about 2 weeks after i finally got them :( So con for me personally. I could have returned and repurchased but i generally do not like those tactics , working myself in retail. On upsude got free game and 50$ ioculus credit :)

If you're wondering whether or not it's worth having a 3rd sensor well let me just say experiencing the Rift in 360 is a whole new level of immersion. My room isn't even that big but it just adds so much more to the experience I love it. It even comes with a male to female USB 2.0 extension(14ft) so you don't have to buy one.

Waited till the price went down and save up the money for the headset. But when I've first tried it out. I've couldn't believe how realistic it was when I've tired the Oculus Touch demo. If I where you I recommend buying a third sensor for 360 room scale.But on the other hand my parent don't know how to use the touch controller very wells. Because my parents are old and don't know how to use technology very well. The only issue I had playing the rift was accidentally pressing the pause button with my Palm because I have big hands.But I did let my parent tryout the roller coaster simulation instead and my step dad said,  ""it felt like you where in a roller coaster and I almost felt like falling out of the chair short of.""But all in all it worth the $400 I've paid for. But I do hope they Drop the price for the Rift this Black Friday.UPDATE my touch controller cracked and they won't even replace it. Never again supporting these guys.

Pros:Setup is quick and without problems.The tracking is excellent, found no obvious errorsThe touch controllers are fun to use.New price is very good.Cons:Really, really grainy picture. ""The screen door effect"" as it called, I think. I can clearly see the pixel matrix.For active games that should not pose a great problem, but for slow paced it's noticeable and annoying at least.Movie watching in 3D is a no go. The picture is blurry and single free player from market is nearly dysfunctional.Can't remember half of the settings between runs. Subtitles are real pain to look at.The home screen of oculus app won't center for my seating position no matter how many time I've tried.So, for the choice of genres I've had to move my head extremely to the left ;)The app store is almost empty if you ask my opinion. There are some free titles to try and some of them are fun, but the list is short.Didn't managed to run some of my steam games with vireio perception tools.Wanted to do skyrim in VR for a long time, but didn't even tried with oculus because of picture quality...

Insanely difficult setup.  So much so that I never did get it set up and had to send it back!  I bought a new ASUS gaming computer.  thinking it would be an easy setup.  It fought me every bit of the way.  First it wouldn't even run the setup program.  I finally found the problem affects lots of WIN 7 machines and Oculus was notified of this bug back in January of 2017.  it still hasn't been fixed and the solution?  reinstall windows!!then it wouldn't recognize the HDMI and USB cables that were plugged in.  It turns out the HDMI problem is caused by a ""certain amount of"" bad HDMI connectors that are on the Oculus headsets.  The Occulus HDMI connectors will actually ruin your graphics card connector too so you have to buy a new graphics card!  There is NO warning anywhere in your package to check this .  I found it buried in a forum.  Then the USB 3 connection wouldn't work.  Apparently Oculus needs a certain manufacturers brand of USB3.  I was told to buy a new USB3 card for my machine!Oculus get your act together!!

Make sure to research and test this item at a local electronics store before buying.Unfortunately for me I didnt bother testing first and was unable to use this device due to my physical facial features basically not meeting the requirements... Apparently my eyes are too close to one another and the glasses do not adjust inward enough for me to get any decent clarity. The display, being already blurry just got allot worse for me. I did find info about 3rd party companies that make parts for issues such as this but its just not worth it. Having to buy this device at full price and then buying 3rd party lenses and parts was just to costly.I attempted to reach out to the Oculus Support team but that was a total miss as they never responded. This caused me to reach out to general support from other users on their public forums. That was a total mistake as I instead was receiving nonsense and bullying from immature gamers and fanboys of the device.In the end I returned this for a refund. I hope that a future release/model that will support and resolve the issues I experienced. So again, make sure to research and test this item at a local electronics store before buying.

The controllers are the only redeeming feature of this. The lenses have less swirls than a vive, but they are blurry as all heck, looks like there is Vaseline on the lenses. The head set cannot be used if you have a bigger head than a 5 foot 2 100 pound person. If you have bad vision you cannot use this at all with out your glasses, and your glasses aren't going to fit. I had to bend mine to the point of braking them to get them in there. I have really small glasses and a small head also. Even with doing that, there is 0 protection from the glasses, and they rubbed and started wearing 2 circles in the corner of the rift lenses.It is less heavy than the vive, so there is that. Also it is not cheaper than a vive. In order to get close to vive room scale, you need 4 sensors. This requires over 50 feet of usb cable, and 2 usb controllers. So make sure you have 3 usb 3.0, and 2 usb 2.0. Make sure you use nothing else usb, unless you buy a pcie usb card.Also this is not going to work with anything less than 16gbs of ram. Just to run the Oculus bloat ware program costs you around 3-4gbs of ram. So I had the Oculus bloat program up, and just steam home, and I was at 7gbs ram usage. When I loaded Elite it went to 8.5-9 gbs. It uses serious ram for these cameras, and the bloatware it self.As I said the only good thing about it is the controllers. The only way I could recommend buying this, is if you want to play a game where you sit and stare straight, like elite dangerous or something like that. You are very skinny between 100-145 pounds, and have perfect vision or wear contacts. Room scale is worse than vive, even with 4 cameras. The cameras are damn near impossible to get mounted to the wall right, unless you have some high powered glue, or drill holes through them, which you need them mounted on the ceiling if you want it to be any where near vive.  It took me over 6 hours to get these set up right to even come close to vive tracking. Then you gotta deal with running 50 foot of usb cable.

So a fast review of the Touch controllers. For the longest time the oculus rift has been a let down for me.  I bought the Rift about two months back and for the most part its been a system that was fun but just felt like it was just a demo. Facebook/rift dropped the ball badly by releasing the rift unfinished. Lots of friends played with the system and had a blast, but I had to explain the novelty was not even close to being worth the asking price.With that little down vote for the rift why are the touch controllers a 5 star? They make the rift worth the price, it is that simple. I only have my controllers for a single day now and honestly it changes VR. All the crap the vive owners have been giving the rift people? totally justified, I have messed with a vive a few times and room scale/free motion of the body is what makes VR. After you try it once you can not go back really. If you own a rift there is no question, this is a must buy. It took around 20min for me to set up the 2nd ""eye"" and controllers. I spent the better part of the day and night just messing around with games on steam and the few free ones that came with the pre order. It really does expand VR beyond being a fun toy to a real experience. The main questions that I have been asking myself now are1)Is the rift worth buying without the touch? No.... don't think about buying the rift without the touch.2)Is the rift/touch worth buying? Yes, if you have the money and want to make the jump it is worth the price.3)Is it worth buying over the vive/PSVR? Yes/No...You had to see this coming. The vive does room scare far better and at a lower price point, PSVR is far cheaper and there are millions of PS4s on the market already(and they have lots of AAA backing)However the rift does in my experience far better at the standing system and is more comfortable and the touch seem to be far better controllers. So my answer is this.-If you have the money and have limited space The rift is better. Touch is a must buy alongside the rift otherwise forget it-if you have the money and have large space 5x5 to bigger, the vive is better.-if you have limited money/space and already own a ps4 the PSVR is better.there is no clear winner yet so its hard to say what system is worth your money in the long run. This is early tech, if you don't have money to take a risk on something that might be gone in a few years don't buy any VR yet. So far I am really impressed with the Touch controllers, they just feel better if your hands then the vive's and have just as good tracking.

I've got mixed feelings on the Rift. Having lived through VR in the 90's (and playing Doom or whatever was out then on a 640 screen...), this is definitely a step ahead of where we were 20 years ago. Some games made me giddy and some things left me scratching my noggin.On the plus side, for games that were written for VR, it's really an incredible experience. Graphics look good, sound was surprisingly better than I expected and the sensors do an excellent job tracking you. The headset is fairly light, all things considered. The touch controls feel light and comfortable for extended periods of time. Oculus Home software works pretty good and with the recent update, Steam games show up after you've played them once.I was going to get the third sensor for the full room setup and didn't end up needing it at the moment as I was able to space out the two sensors wide enough to cover me at the desk and standing up. If I were turning completely around and kept facing away, I would have some spotty movement since I don't have the third sensor. Hasn't been an issue for me up to this point. I'm not too crazy about the price of the third sensor and some links on their site indicate that this is still experimental. Either say you can and support it or say you can't and don't allow it. Really rough here Oculus.On the negative side, I personally stay a bit warm and live for air conditioning. There's a small amount of heat generated from the headset and it's just enough after closing off my face inside the mask that it makes me pretty warm, to the point of sweating a bit at times if I'm dodging killing robots. Heated face leads to fogged up lenses. Fogged up lenses lead to a blurry visual experience. I've played around a bit trying to figure out how to position and try to leave a bit of a gap at the bottom to let some air in and it hasn't helped any yet. This doesn't happen every time, so now I try to make sure I take a break every so often to cool off and crank down the air before I get all worked up over those robots. It is rather aggravating though.Another negative I found was figuring out the sweet spot to look through the lenses. I'm borderline needing glasses, so that doesn't help any. For me, the lenses are very specific to the angle you need to look. If you like to turn your eyes more than your head, you'll have plenty of fuzzy looking things. If you don't position the mask up/down just right, you'll have plenty of fuzzy looking objects when you look straight ahead. I'm also borderline whatever it's called on the distance between your eyes. The rift allows you to adjust out to something like 71. I apparently could stand to be out another notch or two. So if you have a fat head like me, you may experience some blurry because you can't adjust the lenses out far enough.Game-wise, I didn't find as many things out there that I wanted as I hoped. There's plenty of games out there. Look on Steam and you'll find pages and pages of them. There's some cool ones that I can play standing. Found myself down on my knees a couple times hiding behind cover even. Luckily I found a few that allow me to rest my butt in the chair when I'm worn out. SteamVR is a mixed bag for me as it didn't always stay centered. I'd find myself facing backwards at some point and without the third sensor, I enter unknown (by Rift) territory on movement. Overall, most every game I tried out looked good and worked well as long as I made sure it was designed for Rift *and* the touch sensors.My biggest disappointment was with virtual desktops. I'm a dba/architect/nerd and live in things like VS and SSMS. My grand hope was that with Steam's Bigscreen or one of the other virtual desktops, I'd be able to sit there and play John from Minority Report, not to mention have large windows to witness all the glory of C# spewed all over the place. Well, that didn't work out as well as I hoped. From what I read, the Rift's graphic capabilities prohibit it from showing text in a non-pixelated way. If I kept the windows small enough, I didn't see the pixelation, although then I couldn't see the screen. If I made the window larger, I could see the text and then I ran back into the issue of turning my eyes instead of my head to look around (blurry vision out the sides). I'm not sure there's anything with this generation of hardware that can change this. Watching Netflix and Bluray did work well and made my 75"" TV feel kind of small afterwards.Overall, it's a great experience. Maybe in another 20 years they'll have more of it worked out. I looked at the Vive and at the time, it wasn't discounted yet. Mixed bag on which to pick. I like how Vive doesn't have USB sensors and I read they have wider eye adjustments (didn't realize that fact when I purchased). One big thing that ticked me off is how this is packaged now. This is the same hardware as the previous package that *also* included the little remote and an xbox controller. I wasn't so worried about the controller as I live on a PC for a reason. Having to spend an extra $30 or whatever for the remote though seems cheap on their part. If you are looking to purchase, find the package that includes those items for the same price (at time of this writing anyway). Even though it doesn't say it, it includes the same free games as well (no code entered, you get them when you create your Oculus account and set up the Rift). I almost returned this to get the other. I haven't tried the third party face plate replacements yet.Final notes. If you can, make sure you try this out somewhere to see if it fits like you need it to. Pay attention to eye width distance and play something besides the great looking games (not as noticeable on blurry in games). Also make sure you have the space to set this sucker up (it recommends 5x7' min).

The controllers for the touch work amazing! Your hands natural fit to the curves of the controllers so when your in VR it feels like it's just all you. The tracking works really well but you can lag out some if you turn around from the sensors but that happens to all VR controllers and if you have a three sensor setup it won't be a problem at all. I have played other headsets and used other controller and the Oculus is absolutely my favorite.

I can only give it two stars, and I'm compelled to comment, just because I can't believe how much stuff doesn't work in their titles.  About half of the titles I've downloaded actually work - the rest of them leave me staring at a black void until I back out of it. The hardware is really finicky, sometimes it needs a reboot for no reason because of USB tracking issues.  I've added a USB3 card along with the hub on my mainboard to make sure I've got the bandwidth it needs and it still jitters and stutters and I have to reboot for no reason to clear tracking errors. Fogging of the lenses is a problem, and they are constantly getting oils on them from I guess my eyelashes and eyebrows but they mentioned somewhere not to clean them with anything beyond a microfiber cloth.When it works, it's quite an impressive immersive experience. I just can't believe the number of titles rushed out the door and pushed to the library that won't load past the intro screen.  It's pathetic frankly.

I was a bit skeptical as I had only previously used PSVR and the VIVE. But after using it for the first hour or so, it is comparable if not better than the VIVE. The touch controllers are easily the best controllers I've ever used for any game system, and I'm including the XBox 360/One controllers. The diverse library of games that work with the VIVE is incredible, not to mention how much of it is free.

I had recently purchased a oculus rift and found the experience great with two sensor tracking. With the two oculus sensors you get pretty good coverage. However I found anything behind me would loose tracking easily. The third sensor works to perfectly cover the dead zone directly behind me. Setting up the third sensor is a bit finicky but once you have it right it works great. Now I can interact in vr grabbing or reaching things that I couldn't before. Buying a third sensor is pretty much needed for full coverage roomscale vr.

EDIT: Oculus responded to this review saying it should have been there. Amazon's solution was to have me order an extension cable (I hope the one I get works, since I don't know the exact one that was supposed to come with it) and give me a partial refund to cover the expense of the cable. I'm not particularly thrilled with this transaction, but I don't think it's Oculus's fault, and the sensor itself is exactly what it's supposed to be, so I updated the review to 5 stars.----3 stars for removing the extension from the package and forcing us to buy one, since it's very clear that nobody can use this as a rear sensor for room-scale without one. In fact, it's probably going back to Amazon for a refund. I've had too many problems finding USB extension cables that work, and I shouldn't have to spend the extra money on something Oculus KNOWS we're going to need. Very bad move.

The design and ergonomics is better than HTC Vive, but sacrificing tracking quality. When I place them on a sofa they can start drifting if occluded from one sensor (so visible only to the second one). So it seems like this set-up isn't very convenient even for 180 gameplay, since your controllers are not tracking good when you put them somewhere. Definitely need a third sensor. If that's not going to work, I'll just switch to Vive (where you don't need to keep in mind some specific areas where you can put controllers or where they are tracked good or not – they are just tracked everywhere).

I purchased this Oculus sensor to setup full 360 degree tracking along with the Oculus Headset and Touch controllers. It works great so far, and I have had no issues setting it up. However, in order for it to work optimally you must set it up in a certain spot of the room adjacent from one of the other sensors. This is fine, but it did hinder my original plans for the setup.This device is not wireless and must be plugged into your PC/Mac directly in order for it to work. The package from Amazon does come with an USB extension cord that extends the sensor quite far. I do wish these sensors performed the same way as the Vive sensors, though (those don't need to be plugged in the PC and only a wall outlet, reducing wire clutter).Overall, I'm glad I purchased it and I'm happy that I can finally expand my play area to take full advantage of every Oculus game and app.

A whole new paradigm for gaming! I had pretty low expectations as this is first generation hardware (not including the developers kit). But using the system really does feel like a huge leap in immersion. The touch controls are indispensable, and integral to having the full experience. The resolution is the biggest weak point, as many have noted, and this was my main concern before purchase, but the experience is just so powerful that it doesn't really matter. I would highly recommend this product if you have the means and are interested in experiencing the next frontier in gaming.

Includes repeater cable. What a crock of BS. Yea it comes with a Monoprice USB extension cable. Except for the fact that the system is designed to run on USB 3.0 and the cable included is of 2.0 specification. Wouldn't that defeat the purpose?  Now I have to pay extra to get new cables.Other than that, at least the sensors are genuine.

First off, let me say that the Oculus Rift is truly next level stuff. The VR experience you get with this product is mind blowing. I thought it would be good, but this product will definitely blow your hair back! That being said, the only issue I have with it is that it requires 3, 3.0 USB A type inputs which, when you run the compatibility checker (which I strongly suggest you do BEFORE purchasing as the hardware requirements for this product are astronomical) it DOES NOT MENTION THIS FACT!!!! I ensured that my son ran the compatibility checker prior to ordering. It said we were all A-OK. No problem! Imagine my surprise when my son went to install it on Christmas morning and his 3 Trillion dollar AlienWare laptop (which we ran the compatibility checker on) only has 2 USB 3.0 A type inputs! Talk about a huge bummer! We had to wait until the 26th to go to our local Staples to get a 3.0 USB type C to A converter (around $14). While not a big deal, Oculus really should say how many USB ports are required (and for 3 Trillion dollars, AlienWare can afford to add another USB port…) All in all a solid 5 star rating.

I love the Oculus, the only problem is after a few days it got boring really fast. There are no fun games to play that don't give me a headache. The only good game that i played that i can play without getting sick was Star trek bridge crew which isn't included. I would buy again when there is more games and better optimization. I'll probably buy the vive later on when they release their new controllers. For now, i refunded the Oculus because of the headaches i get and my lack of room space.

An indescribable experience, I'm just delighted! I do not understand people who are dissatisfied with the resolution and pixel sizes, the picture is a bit blurry, but you instantly get used to it. Played in Robo Recall, the graphics are incredibly realistic. As far as I can tell, the helmet and controllers are executed at the highest level, everything is convenient and well thought out. I got a small defect, the grip button on the left controller reacts badly to the presses, it takes a little effort, but it's not critical.

Bought this as a third sensor so I could do full room VR. It worked as predicted and got rid of the issue of having my Touch controllers stop working if I turned too far away from the front sensors. Now I can turn around completely and still have everything function perfectly. I will warn you that adding that third sensor makes setup a bit trickier than usual, but it's worth the effort once all the sensors are in place.

This is a great system at a good price. I have been wanting one for some time and finally bought one. The VR really is an experience and exceeded my expectations. I had to upgrade my video card on my PC but I was due for an upgrade anyway. The Oculas did not work with my GTX 780. I had read that it would. I bought a GTX 1080 Aorus and it works great. The sensors were a difficult to get working at times. Make sure that when you are setting them up they can see the headset.

 Having used the Oculus Rift for some time I was really looking forward to getting hold of the Touch controllers and see just what they could do.They arrive well packaged and in the box you get two controllers, one sensor, a Rock Band adapter and two AA batteries.Each controller takes a single AA batter and they feel very comfortable in the hand.  They have an interesting design with a circular band you slip your hand into.  I assume the band is a safety feature as it's already stopped me from smacking my hand on a wall while in game!Setup was fairly simple.  You'll need an additional USB port to plug the extra sensor and then you start the Oculus setup guide.  It shows you what to do, checks sensors are positioned correctly and gets you to setup a guardian zone.This zone is important to setup as it throws up a virtual wall when you're Rift approaches the boundary to stop you from walking into a real wall.Once setup is completed you're dropped into a brilliant tutorial that really shows off how good the controllers are.  It's a brilliant demo and it's amazing just how immersed you become, quickly picking things up, putting them down, interacting with them, it's a fantastic showcase.It's great to see software bundled with the controllers so you don't have to go and spend more right away.Medium is a creative package that lets you sculpt in 3D.  Not being especially creative I've not put a massive amount of time into this.Dead and Buried is a brilliant introduction to how different gaming with touch controllers is.  Draw your six shooter and take on other players in western style shoot outs, ducking behind tables and throwing dynamite.  For a really intense game swap to horde mode and hold out for as long as you can while waves of creatures come charging at you, they attack from all around and can get right up in your face, it's amazing!Toy Box isn't so much a game, more a technical demo that lets you play in a...toy box!  Great way to demo the Rift and controllers to friends and family.The Unspoken has you casting spells against other players, chucking fireballs, deflecting incoming attacks, summoning help, it's a brilliant idea and is much easier to get the hang of than you might first expect.The games I've tried as multiplayer and I've had problems finding others in matchmaking, hopefully that problem will ease as more people get the controllers.The only problem I've found so far is in long term comfort.  After a particularly intense session I found I had slightly sore hands from gripping the controllers, but I suspect that's just me over doing things and I'll take more breaks in between games from now on.Even with that in mind I can't recommend these enough.  If you've splashed out on the Rift the touch controllers are a must have addition to your VR setup.  Now I just need to rearrange my house to build a dedicated large VR room!UPDATE: Just tried out Bullet Train and it is AWESOME!  It's not a full game, more like a short concept game, but it's the closest a game has ever gotten to giving you a Matrix like experience, picking up guns, firing until the clip runs out, casting them aside and grabbing another set.Since my original review I've also managed to get some player on player action in the Unspoken, it's really good fun but I've discovered a bit of a problem.  In the game you stand on pillars, most are a little off the ground but some are really high up.  I didn't consider that being stood on a pillar high up in a VR world would trigger vertigo!  That's how immersive the Rift is and being stood up really enhances that.  Incredible bit of kit!

Honestly, after owning the Oculus, I feel as though I should have got an HTC Vive. I really don't like the motion tracking that the Oculus has, because it's really easy to block the camera's line of sight with your body and lose tracking. The headset itself works great, and I like that it comes with built in speakers. The controllers are also easy to use, and very ergonomic. I don't like that the Oculus has it's own DRM, and that the product is owned by Facebook. It makes me wonder whether or not a Facebook account will be required to use this device in the future, but I digress. I bought this product because it is cheaper than a Vive, and it works fine. But if you have the option to between the two VR headsets, my recommendation is for the Vive.

Great controllers for a great price. These are great, however the tracking is poor. USB compatibility is terrible. When you buy an Oculus Rift and Touch controllers there are too many hidden costs. You may have to buy a USB card. You WILL HAVE to buy a third Constellation camera (if you want decent tracking). You may buy a 4th Constellation camera (If you want great tracking similar to the Vive). You have to buy USB extension cables. And you might have to buy (or 3D print) brackets for your camera because the best setup is to invert the cameras and place them high. I returned this and the headset and bought the HTC Vive.

After several days of using it, I would recommend you wait for the next generation of VR headsets or look into other manufacturers that offer larger field of view at higher resolutions. The field of view distracts from the immersive experience but the real downer is the resolution. It's just not there yet even with supersampling. One final observation is how abrasive the padding that forms around your face feels.The setup was easy enough and the handheld controllers feels pretty natural. The audio is very good. Packaging excellent.Even with the lackluster execution of this product, VR is a unique experience worth checking out!

You buy these things to establish a room scale with the Rift, (or to replace one broken because a cat was running around like a crazy dude and knocked one over on the selfie stick tripod that held the one in the rear up for room scale).

Works great, lots of fun to be had. Changes the VR experience quite a bit when you can suddenly interact. Highly recommended for all creative individuals considering the software offerings (including free ones) for drawing and modeling.Unfortunately, the product has seemingly had some initial teething issues. It seems there is damping pads in the trigger buttons, in short time those can get unstuck from the original positions and get jammed somewhere else within the trigger button. This will manifest itself as a trigger button getting stuck in the pressed in position, a ""sticky"" feel to the trigger button or sudden loud clicking noises. Not sure if they've implemented a fix for this yet, I will be returning my Touch controllers for replacement with hope of better results (although other customers previous experience seems to suggest that the root cause hasn't been fixed and you're likely to experience the same again with the replacements...). Google ""oculus touch sticky trigger button"" for more references.

The head set is easily adjustable and the controllers are easy to handle.

Had high hopes for this as a flight simmer, and everything about this product is great, except for one thing, and for me the most important, and that is resolution.It is really bad on this device, along with the screen door effect it just ruins everything.Totally unuseable for what I need it for.If you just want to play games and dont care about visual quality ,it is fantastic.Keeping my fingers crossed for better technology.

For something that you don't get to try in advance of purchase they should fully describe what you will see in VR. Pixelation, especially on text would be a good thing to include in the description to fully prepare someone dropping $400+ on the system. Also a warning stating that the lense adjustment may not fit everyone would be good to know aswell. I have near to perfect eyesight and the slider maxed out won't let me get an any clearer picture resulting in having to deal with a blurry image, which along with some pixelation makes it upsetting for something I spent $400. Price fluctuations aswell has been irritating, if it's Amazon or Facebook/ Occulus controlling this... I'm not sure, but I paid $400 a month ago and now it's $500.... Why the steap jump in price? I guess you can say it was good for me but I'd be pissed if I just spent $500 and realised it was $400 just a month ahead. I will be returning mine and will also be keeping a closer eye on prices to see if it is Amazon or the products company that is ripping people off with the wild price fluctuations and will base future purchases accordingly.

I honestly wish i never bought this, i was so excited to play with this after work today. But sadly all i had were issues. After waiting a good hour or so for software to install, my HDMI connection refused to work. It wasnt even to say my port was broken (because i checked) it just refused to work...ran a test on oculus's page to see of my computer was compatible and got nothing but green lights. When it came time to play i got to stare into a void of darkness...idk what it was but it wasnt VR, Oh right cuz the HDMI couldnt connect.

I'm sure it's a good system but unfortunately it required additional computer support. Our computer was too old to support it and we didn't want to spend an additional $800 to 1,000 in order to use the system so we returned it. But from looking at over it looks pretty cool. So when you buy this make sure you have a newer computer or are prepared to buy one in order to make it work/use it.

I did not realize how much difference the third sensor mattered until i started using one.i had no complaints about my 2 sensor touch controller setup at all, until i got the third sensor set up and realized that it was much better.Now it doesnt really matter what direction i face or if i put my hand behind my body or am obstructed by an object. my movements are always smooth now, and even though i felt like they were smooth before when i had 2 sensors, i didn't notice how often i had to adjust to make sure i was tracking until i didn't have to do it anymore. This was most noticeable in games where one outstretched arm might obstruct the other when you turn to the side or behind you, like robo-recall and bow shooting games.

The Oculus Rift is more than just an entry point into the VR world of gaming, it is top quality.  Between this and the Vive - both do extremely well.  There are reviews that state there are issues with both the Rift and Vive on 360 degree support, tracking, and more; however, a bit of research and education (easily found on the interwebz) will take you a long ways.A few tid bits: - Setting up for 360 degree support is easily done ON TWO SENSORS, do some interwebz lookups.  Simple to find.  You don't need a third sensor (YET!).  It's experimental as well, per Oculus. - The controls are much better than the Vives current. - It is supported by Facebook.  This means huge financial backing and wanting it to work well (quality and performance).  This is huge compared to the Vive. - Vorpx can allow you to run a lot of games not VR supported natively. - The more powerful your home PC the better any VR system runs.  Steam has a Steam VR test to help you if you are unsure. - Couch party games are hilarious and very enjoyable.  Such as...  - Playroom  - Black Hat Cooperative  - VR Diner Duo  - Ruckus Ridge  - Late For Work

It's clear that VR is in the very early stages of development. The fact that the Rift retails for more than $100 is absolutely mind blowing given how cheaply made it is, how buggy the software is, and how bad 95% of the games are. I'll try to be as far as I possibly can in this review.The Good:When it works it is a pretty amazing experience. Putting the headset on and being transported to another world is something that will impress anyone. I mostly enjoyed Robo Recall. It's a great game with easy to understand controls and a movement system that won't make you barf. My only regret for returning the Rift is this gem of a game.The Bad:Sadly that is all the enjoyment I could get out of it. The fun of the games would be ruing about 10 minutes in when the sensors decide that your left hand is not where it's supposed to be. The tracking on the Rift is pretty bad. So bad that I'm still unsure if I just didn't have a bad sensor. I tried various configurations. Nothing really fixed the issue. It just made the tracking behave wrong in different ways. The tracking issues, while bad, can be tolerated to a small degree. You can still mostly get the full experience.The Ugly:I'll start here with the game library. With the exception of maybe 10 games, everything is unfinished, buggy, shovel-ware garbage. It is a joke how bad a majority of the games are. Even some of the hits are okay at best. Some of the games, while not inherently bad games, had movement controls that would make you immediately vomit after 5 minutes of play. I won't cherry pick the obvious barf inducing games. I'll use Dreadhalls as my example. You only control the camera with the headset and nothing else. You walk with the left thumb stick and can move the camera with the right tumb stick. The combination of the movement and camera controls leaves for a dizzying experience. Even the comfort mode with the camera snapping didn't really help.The worst part about the Rift would have the be the god awful Oculus Home software that is required to be running in order for everything to work. There is no turning the Rift off. You just close out of the software. The Rift is sort of always on. Closing out of Oculus home doesn't really kill all of the Oculus stuff as there are multiple applications that run in the background. Coming from the same company that stole and sold personal data you can why one would not be okay with that.Privacy issues aside, there is more wrong with Oculus Home. Installing the software takes about an hour. I'm not talking about downloading anything either. The first issue I came across is that it would not let me use my second drive. Despite the 1000s of games that rung just fine on it, Oculus requires that the drive be formatted as NTFS. I guess the Oculus games will run on the same drive that Windows is utilizing. It's not like performance is required for VR.The next issue was that the Oculus Home wouldn't install any software after I had installed about 3 games. Trying to install software would result in a notification that the installation just failed. It didn't tell me why. Just that it failed. A quick stroll down google came up with all sorts of solutions:>Reboot your PC>Run as Admin>Run in compatibility mode>Update graphics drivers>Downgrade graphics drivers>Disable anti virus>Reinstall (2 hour endeavor)You want to know what fixed the issue? Seriously, I don't know. I never got it to work. If you know how to fix it please post a comment and help other's out.Conclusion:I want to say that VR isn't ready for the consumer, but that would be unfair to the competitors. I can say that the Oculus Rift is a product that should have spent a couple more years in development. The software required to use the Oculus needs to be built from the ground up. In its current state it's pretty much unusable. It requires too much overhead on top of an already demanding product. Unless you can pick this up for $100 or less I say wait until something more stable comes out. I returned mine and I suggest, if you can, to do the same. At the $400 price tag, It's not worth the broken, buggy frustration.

Do NOT buy the Rift to play old video games in VR!!!!I bought this mainly to play some of my old games in VR after seeing videos online of people doing just that,  this will not work with the Rift as it no longer supports using the HMD as primary monitor.A few words on the Rift. Great fun, great immersion, not much content available. Set up is easy and your first few moments are amazing, (after about half an hour i nearly fell over trying to lean on a table in VR! lol) Unfortunately there really isn't a great amount of content that interests me personally, (i am into MMORPG and JRPG games... those of you who love FPS and other shooters will have more luck than me). Because of the lack of content the Rift will probably spent alot of time in a drawer only brought out for company or to play on a lark.The good: A unique and fun experience.THe bad: Not much variety in content. Games seem more like rushed/ incomplete Proof of Concept rather than actual games. Can not be used as a monitor making it impossible to play old games in VR, (you can play them on a simulated giant screen tho).Bottom line:The Rift looked like the future of gaming and home entertainment, the cost and lack of polish on available games and lack of backward compatibility to play games you already own, (lets face it HMD's are basically a second monitor/ set of control inputs) in VR are crippling the rift and with the current business model, (feel free to blame FB) i don't have high hopes for the future of VR.Honestly, this reminds me of Microsoft's XBox One launch fiasco. I hope Occulus stops trying to appeal to 1/10th of a wider audience and gets back to what made it so fascinating in the first place.

I had the DK2 back in the day and now I bought this. Again, disappointing.Why?- VR has a fundamental problem: You can't move in the game naturally since you're restricted by your physical space. That already eliminates 99% of the games. You CAN move using a controller but it makes you feel sick and feels strange.- Terrible resolution again. Can't read text unless it's very big.- This seems to be something with Oculus itself. Tracking keeps freezing every few minutes for a few seconds. I think I had this same problem with the DK2 and it's happening again on Oculus Rift.- Again, no good titles. The demos are amazing, but there are no actual good games that are playable in VR that don't make you feel sick.- Even the software is buggy. Couldn't install more games in the Oculus store, it downloads fine then keep trying to install but the game is still not installed. Tried with different games. Steam VR games are fine tho.Trust me, don't buy this thing. If you have a big room and can afford to pay more, the Vive is probably better although I would just stay away from VRaltogether, it's overhyped extremely. If you think I'm just some random guy, I have been a geek my whole life, studied CS and have been working in tech for years.Once you try the great demos and start playing some games with it, you'll quickly realise it's a waste of money.

This product is garbage.  Took 3+ hours to install initially because it is poorly designed and is picky about everything (from hard drive to USB drives)... if you have your USB 3.0 from your motherboard, expect right-off that it will not be compatible.  I purchased USB 3.1 slots and finally got the USB working.  Also, if you have SSD and your main drive is dynamic, enjoy setting it up an an alternative drive (has to be installed on a basic drive) because the setup program is too stupidly-designed to recognize the difference between disc drives (It'll give you a ""you don't have enough space"" error and shut down).I finally got piece of garbage working and it worked great for a few months.  When it works, it is a very awesome experience.  However, this morning I wanted to play on it and the piece of garbage decided it needed a firmware update on one of the two sensores and will not work without it.  I tried all the ""stupid"" troubleshooting it tells you to do (unplug and re-plug in, updating all my graphics and USB cards, windows, etc...)... still would not install.  The only thing I can figure is the garbage sensor tried a firmware update without telling me and ""bricked itself"" by being in the middle of an update when i shut down.  Now I have to buy a new sensor if I want to use this... and they are not inexpensive.I have a great PC that I built myself.  gets higher benchmarks than 80% of the other computers that run benchmark tests.  This is a terrible piece of hardware riddled with issues.  Had to uninstall, and then go through the hassle of reinstalling again (I have 4 SSDs and the main windows is on a dynamic harddrive and it will only install on basic hard drives).Do yourself a favor if you do get this.  When you are done playing, shut down the app, and unplug everything so none of the compents brick themselves (essentially when you are in the process of modifying the bios and you remove power, it ""bricks"" the device... essentially turning it into a paperweight).

The oculus itself is amazing. I have no complaints about the experience.The mediocre review is about the order itself.For once, the box was torn to hell when I received it. (It was inside a shopping box which was up damaged, so this happened pre shipping.)The right touch sensor has a squeaky trigger as if it’s been heavily used.When activating the touch sensors to get the free games, I didn’t get the free games. I’m jumping through hoops with oculus support trying to get them, but I haven’t yet.As someone whos worked in the warranty department for major computer companies for years, it’s apparent that what was shipped is a refurbished unit, which is why the wear and tear is there, along with the products not activating as they were supposed to.As for the inside of the package, their is a contents list, everything was there other than the lens cleaning cloth. There was a cardboard holder for it; but no cloth itself.There are Velcro straps that hold all of the components into the molded case. Upon arrival, the Velcro was not strapped for one of the sensors, and it was loose rolling around in the case.On the topic of the 6 free titles, 2 of them can’t really be counted, as they are free regardless of how you purchase your rift, 2 of them are tools for creators, and 2 of them are free when you activate new touch sensors, regardless of what package you get.This isn’t to say the bundle isn’t worth the value, but I do think claiming it comes with 6 free titles when some of those are free to begin with is shady.Overall, get a rift, they’re great, I’ve barely taken it off since I got it.Don’t be fooled by shady marketing tactics, and I would highly recommend ordering from a different distributor, as amazon dropped the ball heavy on this order.

Been looking to get into virtual reality for quilt a while and with this package with the Oculus Rift, two sensors, and touch control for $399 (at the time of purchased), went ahead and go for it knowing my rig is capable of VR. After downloading the setup program, plunging in sensors and headset, follow the given instructions and strapping on the headset and then immersed myself in the experience, messing around with the 6 games and creative software included.Now, I will say there was a issues with setting up the sensor. The main thing finding a set of USB 3.0 ports that is capable of running the sensors and this has been a known issue in the VR community, which generally recommending the Inateck USB pci cards. Unfortunately my motherboard USB ports (Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD3H) didn't meet the required bandwidth or whatever. I tried for the heck of it even though I bought and installed a QICENT 2 port USB 3.1 pci card and fortunately that worked. The other thing that I have a bit of an issue with is understanding the setup guild when its telling me to get in center the sensors, but after a bit of trail and error, it eventually start giving me fine tuning intrusion fo the sensors then good then go from there.Also beware for those who wears glasses, small frames maybe able to fit but isn't a lot of space for them. I figure that since I'm nearside and that the screen is really close to my eyes that I can use them without needing my glasses. Nope, far objects and texts are just as blurry as much real life perspectives.After pointing out the negative aspects, the immersion of being in a cockpit of a 737 in Flight Simulator X (with FlyInside) is such an amazing experience. Also Touch works with FlyInside so the ability flip the switches inside the cockpit is so cool thing to me. Also looking forward to try out other games like racing and driving games once I switch out my flight simulator peripherals with my G27 Racing Wheel.Link to the USB 3.1 Pci card that works with the sensors for me (2 Type A ports)

I purchased this for my oculus rift after watching a video of a guy saying that they are great and sound as good as his $1000 headphones. Unfortunately, I didn't find them to be that great. Don't get me wrong, they don't sound bad, but the original ones that come with the oculus rift sound a lot better and are way more comfortable. These $50 add-on headphones barely have any bass and are uncomfortable to wear. The sound doesn't sound as natural as the original due to the lack of bass. I don't recommend these at all.

I received this product almost two weeks ago. Even though I had a USB 3.0 (that's a STANDARD right?) controller, Oculus didn't work with mine, I had to go out and get the specific chipset controller they wanted me to get. I installed that, which was a pain (likely conflicted with my controller which I had to disable), but I did finally get it installed. Then I ran their setup program, which told me I first needed to install two windows updates that were not even on my list of optional updates to install. So I exited the setup program, and set to installing updates. Thereafter, when I ran their setup program again, it ""Look's like we can't connect to the Oculus server. Check your internet connection.(which worked perfectly with all other websites). Even after 11 days! of working with their support team, they could not get it fixed. Their best guess was that exiting their installer caused some type of corruption in my registry! They wanted to know if I wanted to do a complete reinstall of Windows to try to fix it!! Their setup file didn't write any log at all, they tried everything to find it! They have no stand-alone installer to install without an internet connection! I told them, this was (HONESTLY) the most terrible experience I have EVER had during an install, in over 30 years working with computers.<to Amazon, I am not attaching the screenshot of the correspondence with the Oculus support team, as I am assuming that you judged it was that, that was against your guidelines?

Spent hours and hours (15+ and I am proficient in python, java, c++) trying to get the oculus software to work but never succeeded. Unable to download a single game, all attempts made using several different methods failed. Customer support was beyond terrible. All attempts to reach out for help were useless. 2-3 days before any receiving a response and despite my initial, and very thorough, messages I would get a completely generic reply back asking for details I had already provided. Clearly they never read support tickets until about the 3-4th message for a ticket because I conintued to get generic replies asking for details I had provided already. This equates to 2 weeks before someone actually provides useful support, but I still never got that after 3 weeks of trying.Hardware is fantastic, but the software is straight garbage. Returned the oculus and will avoid for the foreseeable future due to awful customer service and terrible software.

I have had nothing but problems with the Rift.  I have a new Lenovo y920 gaming system and have taken extensive troubleshooting steps and when I contacted Rift for support, they told me that that I they only support certified systems.  That is my bad I supposed, I saw they had the certified systems but didn't get one.I would return this but I cannot, I tried to get it to work for too long.

Oculus support...??This is a pre-use review: 1 star I set up my account & received my confirmation email but when I went to log in I keep getting wrong email/password. I sent three password reset requests, waiting 5-10 between & haven't received a one, not in spam or all mail. I then file a support ticket which i immediately get a confirmation of, 45 min ago. So roughly two hours and I'm still not enjoying the VR experience. Update: Over 24 hours later I finally received my confirmation email which was why I could not log in. Two days later, two days later....I received my password reset email. Setting up and support of said product is pertinent review material.Post use review: TBD

Headset is dark except for infrequent flashes. I contacted support and they said Rift is ""hit and miss"" on laptops.  Yet my new HP Omen beats all the minimum specs on the Oculus web site and when I run OculusCompatCheck.exe, I get Congratulations! You're ready for Oculus Rift. This sounds like a cool device if you get one that works so I'm quite disappointed that mine didn't work and Oculus support has no clue.

Amazon is wonderful..... This product on the other hand is trash.  Ordered it on amazon then went to oculus website to buy games to install and have ready.  Right after i bought the games my oculus arived early so i set it up....well tried to.  The headset was not being detected.  Come to find out this is a typical problem with no real solution and only way to get support is through a ticket which takes days to get a response. So i got a refund through amazon and tried to get a refund through oculus.  They refused because i got the games in a bundle..... So now i have 100 dollars worth of games i cant use.  Do not buy save a little more and get htc.  Their costomer service and quality of product is garbage.  Vive worked instantly when i set it up and its controllers can be charged unlike batter hog oculus controllers.

I have a 300Mb/s down 300 Mb/s up internet connection but the setup is taking forever since it requires downloading 1.70GB at kB/s speeds. This is from within the setup program itself. I've verified that my internet connection is good by running speed tests on the same machine while waiting for this stupid download and left and came back. So far this product is unusable. If you're going to purchase I'd suggest trying to download ahead of time to avoid getting frustrated after you've taken it out of the box, but I don't know how well that will work if you don't have the product yet. I'm very disappointed that they would skimp on their bandwidth like this and it makes more wonder about what other corners they've cut.Update:Installation was a pain due to USB driver problems (hint: unplug all USB devices other than mouse and keyboard from your machine and disable windows from automatically installing drivers if you're adding the recommended Inateck card because of ASRock USB controller incompatibility). But once I got the driver situation straightened out and was able to get started the experience was absolutely amazing. It really feels like you're moving around in this virtual world. I primarily purchased the device for flight sim and with FlyInside and XP11 landings finally feel like real landings - this was never the case with my three monitor setup with TrackIR. I'm on an overclocked i7-4930K and an overclocked 1080ti so you're milage may vary but I'm very happy. SIX stars but minus two for the very painful install especially since I ended up having to uninstall and reinstall various times and had to wait for this thing to redownload each time.

Pros:* Low cost.* 90% of me lost myself in the new world.Cons:* Google Tilt brush, my main reason for getting this, would not let me record audio or record a video of me talking while I made things.* The apps presently made are touching on about 5% of their potential to be really useful. When photoshop can allow me to use an actual pen in VR sitting down and do all the menu items with the addition of 3D and allow me to record a narrative of me making things that would be worth thousands of dollars. As it was, I could not change the size of my pen, it was tiring to stand as I drew, and it was not easier to share the object with another.* My main deciding point is the fact that my hands are sensitive to wireless technology. As a result, they burned after 20 minutes. The same thing happens for me with cell phones so I prefer using wired objects. These transmit more signal, based on my hands burning at the joints than cell phones so people sensitive to that would want to avoid Oculus for now.

Go Rift if you are not sure which way to go.  I have had both.  I know the hype is out there for Vive; I know that no reviewer in the world could give a clear answer on Vive vs. Rift... But it is Rift all the way.1) touch is better than vive controllers have used both!2)  Rift is cheaper!  Less than $700 with room scale and touch.3). You get more free games and and additional $100 toward games on Amazon!!!4). Room scale on Rift requires less space!5). Vive is buggy.  My vive kept having issues staring apps after a few days (why I returned it)6). You can play most if not all of the Vive games on Rift AND YOU CAN STILL ISE STEAM AND STEAM VR APP IF YOU WANT TO.  Does not work the other way (not many Rift games can be played on Vive in many cases).7). Many more, better games on Rift8). Rift hardware is more comfortable by a lot and much easier to use and still has better feel and comfort even if you buy the $100 upgrade for vive (deluxe audio strap)!Where is Vive better):1). I like the steam ""home"" app better than Rift BUT you can STILL USE THE STEAM VR HOME APP on Rift!2). Rift app has to be used on one windows account, no share across family unless you use the same user!  But u can use the steam games across accounts using family share on steam.

I really wish someone had told me the hard truth about VR: anything below a 4k screen right in front of your eye looks like crap. Less crappy the closer it is but exponentially more the further away. Such is the case here, where after the initial wow of your brain being confused for 10 seconds and then adjusting to VR forever thereafter, everything looks like an eyesore of very, very noticable pixels. This means things in the distance to you are huge pixels. There's a lot of points I could make, but this isnt fixable with software. When we can run 2 4k screens simultaneously and still make that affordable, we'll have VR.

Dies ist kein Review der Rift selbst, denn leider komme ich anscheinend nicht dazu sie zu benutzen.Die Rift erfordert das Erstellen eines Oculus-Accounts. Warum eigentlich?

Zuerst ein Lob an Amazon. Top Service wie immer. Haben es ohne Probleme zurück genommen und mir mein Geld erstattet.Nun zur Oculus.Ich habe sie mir gekauft weil ich schon lange VR ausprobieren wollte, und dachte das es mittlere Weile ja Reichlich an Material zum Spielen geben müsste.... hätte ich mich mal vorher Informiert.Man Installiert alles usw. das Funktioniert alles Einwandfrei, dann spielt man zuerst eine Demo die einem ein wenig die Steuerung und Möglichkeiten Aufzeigt....dort dachte ich mir noch verdammt ist das GEIL!Nach dieser ca. 15min langen Demo kommt man in die App und kann dort nun Spiele kaufen usw.....Und dort liegt das Hauptproblem.Wirklich Spiele sind das nicht. Es sind TECH-DEMOS. Und zwar für 40€.Es gibt keine Spiele die man lange Spielen kann und richtig viel Spaß machen.Ich kaufte also ein Spiel für 25€. Ein Rätsel Spiel. Es hat wirklich Spaß gemacht bis... naja es gibt 6 Level und jedes dauert 10min.Also 25€ für 60min Spielzeit.Andere Spiele wie der Roboter Shooter der beim Kauf dabei ist, sind zwar auch nicht perse schlecht aber :- man erkennt immer das Raster der Pixel- es wird einem nach kurzer Spielzeit wirklich immer übel- es ist unglaublich Repetitiv man macht immer das gleiche- da die Augen so nah an den Linsen sind fangen die auch schnell an zu brennen und Kopfweh entstehtSo wenn also jemand wirklich viel Geld hat, dann kann er sich die ganzen Games zwar Kaufen und Kurzzeitige Unterhaltung haben, aber es gibt im ganzen Store dann vielleicht noch 2-3 Games für 40-50€ und das war es dann auch mit den ""Blockbuster"".Noch lauter weitere Tech Demos die einem nur Aufzeigen was alles möglich ist, aber nichts wird wirklich in einem guten Spiel realisiert.Nichts was in einem die Lust erweckt weiter zu spielen o.ä.Es werden einfach viel zu wenig Inhalte für VR Produziert als das es sich für Privat Personen Lohnen würde sich VR anzuschaffen.Ich Persönlich hatte nach meiner 5 Stündigen Erfahrung mit der Oculus absolut kein verlangen mehr jemals wieder damit zu Spielen.Ich hoffe ich konnte ein paar Leuten Helfen die mit dem selben Gedanken gespielt haben :)

From the onset this device attacks the consumer with bloatware and required ""subscription"" software- else you can't even use the $400 device.Not only was I required to install an app that asked me umpteen times to log into FaceBook but had to warn me that it was ""not good"" if I don't share my antics with the world online.The installed app makes you watch a video where they take time to show you how ""zen-like"" their animated Ken-doll can be if he uses his Rift comfortably. It made me wonder how much of the cost of the Rift is tied to their motion graphics (which aren't even in 3D) budget?I think what annoyed me the most is that all I wanted to know was where to position the sensors- which they don't even tell you by step 7 of the application! However, I've had the opportunity to choose an avatar from a wide-array of aliens, dogs (even a balloon dog), and selection of white avatars. For a half-white, half-black person that kinda sucks....The Oculus software (which needs an active internet connection) is required even to use SteamVR. That doesn't make sense to an end-user which implies its real motive is data metric gathering and other privacy invasion behaviors. If you want to collect my data don't charge me $400.I imagine, when the MR devices like the Lenovo Explorer become ubiquitous I will come back and downgrade my review to 1 star.Without the software the device might have been a three or higher.

Believe it or not I've condensed this review...I've tried everything from from head mounted far-from-vr cartridge games in the 90's to Google Cardboard. The former probably shouldn't even be compared to and the latter was neat for a few minutes but no one is ever going to carry that thing around all the time. That and very basic games combined with half a low-res cell-phone screen just doesn't cut it. This means it gets put in a drawer and forgotten about.In steps Oculus and you finally have something that people want to play over and over. When friends come over there's even a bit of social aspect to it when I put the video up on the projector as someone is playing. Everyone laughs when the robots jump you in Robo-recall and you scream or the first time someone tries to lean on a table in the orientation demo. You have to play referee and pull people out of the immersion so everyone can try: describing the experience is nothing compared to being in it. Flying around in Google Earth is just beautiful. Holding VR items up to your face to see detail is uncanny.I mention immersion because that's what set's this generation apart. I'll say right now that 1. The field of view is less than a human's normal view and 2. The resolution is still low enough that you get the so-called screen door effect be being able to see the individual pictures. Guess what? It doesn't matter. The field of view and resolution are enough. The good news is enough is finally the right amount and the only time you notice these things is when you're looking for them. Otherwise you're sucked right in and your biggest worry is reacting to the guardian system so you don't punch a real-life wall. That system is a map you outline in a room beforehand so when you are dodging bullets you know when to snap yourself out of said immersion to recenter yourself. Little details like this are seemingly small but all work together to make a well rounded experience.Hardware wise you get a good amount of adjust-ability in the head mount though when my two-yr-old wants to get in on it there's not a small enough size for her. Big head's need no worry; it gets big enough. Weight is good an I tend to find myself getting motion sick after long play periods before the headset itself feels uncomfortable. Take breaks. The speakers seem pretty simple but like the field of view they are enough that your brain doesn't care when you're in a game. I LOVE the touch controllers. The just feel so comfortable in your hand with controls that are in the natural position of your fingers. Touch sensitivity on everything is a nice touch so you get things like lifting your thumb in the more social games to give a thumbs up. I wish the cords were just a touch longer everywhere. I have a ~7x7 play area with the sensors mounted 8ft off the ground a little over 6 feet apart. The headset is just long enough that it isn't a bother unless you turn over 360 once and the sensor lines have little slack. Some wiggle room would be nice. Good news though, the headset cord is easily replaceable if you get a little rough with it.There's no denying there are improvements that can be made. The good news is the current state is a whole lot of fun and the technology to make the improvements exists. Until that time we finally have replay-ability. I play the same games a lot but active development means there is always something new coming out. You know it's good when friends are asking to play ""just one more level"" over and over.Things to try: Robo-recall, Google Earth VR, Projects Cars, Elite Dangerous

It’s hard to beat the unique experience of virtual reality, and this offering from Oculus Rift is a great chance to begin yours.I’m not a huge gamer, but my adult children are, and they were knocked out by this device. Just the same, my first experience was equally breathtaking. The sense of reality you get is amazing, as you grab, shoot, push, turn, spin, etc., the various objects in the games. I can think of no other way to describe it other than to say that you are truly lost in the game. It is a very wild experience! Prior to this, the most interaction I had was with a Wii. If you can imagine that as the acorn, then this Oculus game is the oak tree.To that end, this can be disorienting for some folks, especially those with tendencies toward vertigo and motion sickness. I liken it to riding a roller coaster in that sense, particularly felt when you doff the headgear and have to readjust to the room. You might feel a bit woozy, but oh wow – what a fun time while you’re “in” the game.As far as set-up, it took my tech savvy daughter about forty-five minutes from box to play, mostly for the calibration of the hand equipment. Also, this game requires some room, not only to move about and not strike things, but also to give the sensors space for optimal performance. Lastly, this game requires a desktop with some game-compatible settings and a monitor. Most of you will know this going in, but for those who wouldn’t (I count myself in that group), it’s good to know that the price only includes the virtual reality equipment/software and not the means to actually “play” the games.Some of the games included are samples; wherein you may play a short mission or chapter and that’s it, but there are plenty of titles to choose from, so you will have a lot of games to browse, from simple manipulative art platforms to futuristic worlds battling robots, and so much more. No matter what game you play, the movement, interaction, and intensity of the audio-visual simulation make it impossible to embrace your inner jaded self. In short, you WILL be dodging items coming at you, reaching out to try and grab or strike things, and shouting with glee as you thoroughly succumb to the thrills and chills of action. It’s simply that intense, and there is nothing else even remotely like it in the gaming arena. Virtual reality is the future of gaming.

The device is basically a brick.  Not because of the device itself, But because of the extreme difficulty trying to get the drivers for the device on a website that will not allow you on it to download said drivers! I have read thousands of comments in which this is a continuous dilemma. Why like so many other hardware vendors they couldn't just put the drivers on a dvd disc so that you could have them at your fingertips then once on the site you just update the software as needed. Getting the device running is crucial if the process is to progress! Once the compatibility program gives you the green light no other compatibility actions should be needed,  especially the extreme actions people were instructed to do. It's a given about hard drive space for virtual memories sake. My computer is fully compatible based on the list of just the minimal hardware required which i exceeded and by the compatibility program itself. The software available runtime Sdk 0.8. 0.0  has an win.exe file for execution and install of said file, runtime 1.0.0 thru 1.17.0 do not have executable files so cannot be installed . Way to many obstacles involved when trying to install  simple drivers that should get the VR experience on the road. What a waste!!!

Works for the most part but I don't like it how little margin for error you have when setting them up. I had my younger brother move one of these around a bit to make room for himself and I have to redo the entire sensor setup because of it. It's nothing game breaking but still annoying enough I am only giving it 3 stars.

Den einen Stern gibt es für die Konzern Arroganz dem Kunden gegenüber. Man meint es nicht nötig zu haben einen einfachen, nachvollziehbaren Kundenservice anbieten zu müssen. So hatte ich Probleme bei der Software Installation, konnte bei Oculus selbst nirgends eine Lösung oder Anlaufstelle finden,obwohl das Internet voll von dem gleichen Problem ist!Ich als Verbraucher mache so einen Mist nicht mit, ...habe kurzerhand das Teil zurückgeschickt

One thing that is NOT mentioned is that you must own a PC...not a laptop...but a high-end, gaming PC with specific graphics cards, 3 USB3 ports, etc. That is the only way it will work with the XBOX ONE or otherwise.  I ended up returning it.  Playstation4 offers a virtual reality system that is less expensive and works with an actual gaming system!  Come MS...pick up the pace and make VR for the XBOXONE! :-)

Had my Rift for few days now and still haven't been able to play. Why? Because of issues creating an Oculus account and connecting with FB. Having to have a separate account and tethering to FB is the dumbest thing. I am worried if I can even use this thing offline at all.  About to return this hassle of a headset and get the Vive as it is also on sale. My friends use the Vive so I know it is better...

Unlike the sensors that came with the Rift and the Touch, this additional third sensor does not easily unscrew from its base. Not sure how I can unscrew it as if I use any additional force, I'm certain that the head of the camera will snap. Poor quality control.

Die Inbetriebnahme ist viel zu kompliziert. Für den Preis erwarte Ich, das man die Brille anschliesst und dann kann es losgehen. Weit gefehlt. 3 Leute, die sich am PC sehr gut auskennen, haben das Ding nicht zum laufen gebracht.  Das geht in der Preisklasse garnicht, finde ich.

Hello from me. I purchased this product and actually i like it and this is very beautiful and cool product. I love the product. Actually I am giving 2 stars - ""i don't like it"" because I bought this item to play with my friend. After the orders been placed(mine and this of my friend), my order came but this of my friend didn't. Amazon you are a big shop but you have to think what you are doing with the thieves. I am feel lucky now for that I got my product but I am feeling really bad for that I can't play with my friend because there are thievery couriers. Also I really will think before I buy my next product because I will know that probably my product will not come and I will have a big problems after that and my money will go in the nothing.

Facebook hat 4 Mrd investiert und die haben nicht herausgefunden das die Menschen kein Licht durch die Nase sehen wollen. Bei der PSVR Brille ist absolute Dunkelheit garantiert, somit empfehle ich die PSVR. Vl. lesen das Team von Oculus diese Bewertung und optimieren das bei der nächsten Generation. Zudem kann ich nicht wie bei der PSVR meine Kopfhörer direkt beim Kopf anschließen. Also man merkt Sony denkt mehr an das was die Kunden wollen, die haben aber auch mehr Erfahrung mit Endkunden

You are required to have a pc And windows 10 AND a streaming app to be able to play anything on Xbox one. When ordered this it wasn't clear at all. Only saw this stated after digging through member questions. Back in the box it goes.
