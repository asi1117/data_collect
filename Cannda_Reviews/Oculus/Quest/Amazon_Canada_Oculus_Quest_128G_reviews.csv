Firstly, I am not a gamer and before purchasing the Quest had never tried VR. I was originally interested in VR as an entertaining way to stay active and even workout, but I know that I will use this headset for so much more now that I have it.I had waited several months for the release of this product, because I wanted a wireless and easy to use device and I didn't have a gaming PC to run Rift etc. When I finally got it, I was concerned that, after all the hype and waiting, that I would be disappointed or underwhelmed. I am very pleased to report that was definitely not the case. I was blown away by the quality and immersive experience!Owners of premium 6-DOF PC VR headsets may find this product underwhelming, because they are coming from a different frame of reference. Personally, I would not give up the wireless freedom and portability of this device for the sake of better graphics. From my perspective, the graphics blew me away, despite the hype for this product, I was not expecting the visuals to be this good.I thoroughly recommend this product to anyone interested in trying VR. You will love it!

It's mobile with 6dof which is great! They limited the usage of virtual desktop, an app that could let you stream vr from other sources.  I have pixels that are brighter than each other.  Oculus doesn't allow you to cast side loaded apps using native casting methods.Hopefully it's the last of the first gen.  Uses old hardware and the optics are still cheap causing godrays when you have high contrast.  Screen door is still there. If you don't need mobile I recommend Valves Index.

I recommended this headset for anyone that wanted to get into VR without hassle and for a great price. Oculus offers the best bang for your buck, 100%. A standalone 6 DOF headset for only a couple hundreds, way below any other headsets like the Valve Index (that also requires a quite powerful PC to use at it's full potential)But now there is a gigantic BUT...Do you want to use your Facebook login to even use your device, to then go to games like Facebook Horizons and get recorded 24/7 by Facebook so they can see whatever you do and say, whenever they want? No? You don't even have one? Well too bad! Starting in October, you'll have to use a Facebook account to even USE the headset. Already have an Oculus account? Well you're lucky since you can still use it.... until January 1st 2023. After that, you'll HAVE to merge it with a Facebook account. If not, you are risking losing all of your purchased content from the Oculus store.This is what happens when there's no competition. Companies do whatever they want since customers don't have any other options. Facebook don't have competition in the standalone market, so they have total control on what they do, and customers have to accept having their personal data being stolen and sold to some 3rd parties.No wonder it got removed from the store and you can only buy it from 3rd parties or used. I'll just get myself an HP Reverb G2, slightly more expensive, but totally worth it for PC VR. For anyone on a tight budget, just find an original Vive (the black one, not the Pro being super expensive or the Cosmos being trash) on Ebay, escape the Facebook monopoly and save your personal information.

For context, I've used the HTC Vive and I own a Lenovo Mixed Reality HMD.Tracking is the first thing that stands out. I put a lot of time and stress into getting the Lenovo to work reliably, but the Quest makes it feel like a joke. Not only are the controllers way lighter, but it just feels so much more responsive.  I'll probably never play Beat Saber on my Lenovo again. The Quest is that good.The weight is a negative. The lighter weight of the WMR is preferable --the Quest is front heavy like the Vive, but I feel like I could get used to it. It's a small trade off for so many other clear improvements. Strapping a battery to the back might help balance it out.IPD adjustment means less eye strain, and the glasses spacer works as intended as well. The picture and sweet spot are so much clearer than the Lenovo. The guardian system is genius. Not feeling that tug on your head from a cord is also very freeing.Once 5ghz streaming improves, this will be the de-facto headset to own. I can't wait to start making games for it.

I own a PSVR and Vive. Untethered is definitely the future of VR. Although I will always prefer my Vive for graphics and depth of gameplay, the Quest is a great, high quality solution for ease and portability. Put it on, power it up, and you're playing in VR without wires or a PC. The games are mostly arcade / cartoon like, but the quality and immersion is excellent. Audio could definitely be louder and better quality, but headphones fix this issue. Highly recommended.

I'll start by saying I have been running the Oculus RIft for last year or so, so i may be a bit biased.  However, I have to say that this device far exceeded my expectations.  The freedom and convenience of use that comes with not needing the laptop, sensors and general effort to set-up and use cannot be understated.  It literally makes experiencing high-end VR as easy as turning on your TV, which is a MAJOR leap forward in my opinion.  Also, I had resigned myself to accepting a reduction in technical performance and visual deliveries, but I have a hard time finding anything material or significant to really whine about when you consider the above.  Whether it's gaming, watching movies or the increasingly amazing social aspects that have been incorporated into just about everything, this device delivers in spades.  The only general comment would be the lack of games, apps and movies compared to other set-ups, but presumably these will come given how amazing this device is.  The general ease and speed of use is also incredible, my 10 year old grabbed it and within 5 minutes had it figured.  Wow.

My daughter's eye doctor had asked us to use VR for our daughter's visual therapy. It was an initial outlay of about 3500$ for both the program and headset, which we see as an investment in her.Anyway, the program works perfect and we've purchased a few games beyond the free ones that you can download. In our home, we all have iPads and do not have a PC nor a Mac. So the Quest was/is perfect for us. My daughter, she's 7, has been able to take to it fairly quickly - actually she took to it quicker than my wife.As for me, I like using the Quest for Beat Saber and the Vader Immortal games. I haven't used VR before and this blew me away :) it is an amazing experience! Note, the headset is a bit big without buying some padding. We use and I recommend the VR Cover Head Strap Foam Pad for Oculus™ Quest as it has made the setup a lot more comfortable.

What a blast! Having purchased Nintendo Switch Cardboard VR just weeks earlier I didn't have very high expectations for this. Boy was I wrong, the Oculus Quest is Rift quality not Cardboard VR. What an experience, 2 weeks with the device and I'm still in Awe at how amazing this is. We had guests over, had them try canoe in the national geographic game, space pirates, beat sabers and every single person out of them were in disbelief that it's a standalone device. The boxing game made the girls pretty intimidated by the ""presence"" but the guys had a blast.

This is my first Oculus headset and it's amazing! Worth every penny. I was holding out for the 64gb version but decided to bite the bullet and got this one. Coming from a psvr, this is a big upgrade. Battery life is good. For those that complained about the battery cover slipping off the controllers during long sessions, it has never happened to me after a 2h session. And for those that are hesitant on the quest vs the rift S, if your confortable enough with tech, you can get steamvr and oculus rift games working with the Quest. It works really well if you have a vr ready pc and a good 5ghz WiFi router. Also the headset is front heavy, but i still don't find it necessary to have some sort of counter weight. But one thing I will recommend is that you head over to cover vr.com and purchase the kit because you will get sweaty and the factory coushing absorbs and stays damp which is a problem when you want to share the headset. Another thing is that is you plan to play outside, avoid sunny days or do it after or close to sun set.

I never thought I would enjoy this as much as I do.  It’s really immersive and surprised how well the meditation apps works.  It’s also really good to keep your whole body moving when playing a game and believe or not actually makes you break a sweat.This is why I recommend you also purchase protective gear like additional face cushion you can wipe clean and disinfect.  I also recommend buying neoprene or rubber covers for the controllers - not only do you get a better, non-slip grip but the casing around the hand held pieces prevent the battery cover from slipping during aggressive play.  I found the head gear comfortable enough without any additional covers but if there is more than one user in your house I’d consider getting something additions that wraps existing straps so that you can remove and easily wash them.  Sweaty, greasy, hair can make it icky after a while.  I haven’t ordered mine yet but will be knowing what I know now.The graphics vary from app to app and overall they are really good for the interactive stuff you’ll play.  However, when watching Netflix, Amazon Prime video or other TV type viewing the picture is not as good.  It’s watchable and the rooms you can watch them in make it feel like your actually at a theater minus the UHD picture.  Then again that’s not what VR is for so I can live with it.Bottom line is this stuff has come a long way and at the current price point it’s good to jump in now.  It will get better in the next few years and this was a good way for me to confirm I like VR and will definitely upgrade as technology continues to improve.

Though it is a neat little Gadget it came with a broken controller. After contacting Oculus they keep telling us how to fix the controller many different ways we have tried over and over again nothing works. They will not offer a replacement or refund. After $800 you would think they would at least send a replacement controller it would only cost them $100. I paid 800 for this unit for a Christmas present. Not great when you give somebody a gift that doesn't work. Waste of money.

This was my first experience with a full VR headset beyond using the samsung gear and I'm very impressed.  I bought the 128GB model as the 64GB was out of stock but don't see a reason beyond that to get the larger storage.TL:DR, great headset with only minor flaws.I normally wear glasses but found they weren't needed; it does come with a spacer in case you have a strong prescription.  The lenses have a very targeted ""sweet spot"" so expect a lot of fine adjusting over the first day or two to find yours.  Also make sure you loosen the middle strap completely before putting on the headset, it comes very tight.  As strange as it sounds I would recommend looking up a video on YouTube on how to properly adjust everything.  It would have made my experience much better from the get go.The headset isn't without it's flaws but I think that may be just where things are in VR right now.  In black loading screens or very dark scenes I do notice differences in the light levels which is surprising considering it's an OLED screen.  Once everything is going it's a non-issue though.  The so-called ""screen door"" effect is somewhat noticeable even with the resolution as high as it is but only if you really look for it.  Again, a non-issue once you're playing and I expect it's that way with most headsets that aren't a 5 digit price.Oculus link works great.  I only have occasional minor hitching and that's usually during exceptionally busy scenes or loading.  Make sure you get a decent cable like the Anker 10ft USB C one recommended by Oculus.  You can use it with a USB 3 extension but I do have some issues sometimes getting the PC to recognize it.The biggest issue by far is the weight.  It's around 1.25 pounds or 570 grams which is a lot to have on the front of your head.  Once the head strap is adjusted properly I can use it for around an hour before my face starts to hurt from it resting on my cheekbones.  I ended up buying an 8 pack of 2oz fishing weights and taping them to the back of the headset strap to counterbalance it and now I can use it for double that time.  Your mileage may vary.Overall it's a great experience and great if you want to get into VR without breaking the bank.  VR has come a long way and I suspect with the advancements coming for this one in particular (hand tracking, possibly wireless oculus link) it's going to be a good year for VR.

Easy to setup.  Easy to get custom songs for beat saber.  Magnetic battery covers are weak.  They tend to come off while playing beat saber.  Have been able to increase magnetism with some earth magnets on the covers when not in use.  Seems to hold better, but still slide off when you really get into the game.  Bought a patch cable to plug into theatre system. 26' cable to keep the cord behind me out of the range of swinging arms. Dual 12"" subs really get you into it.

If you are a grown up with kids, let me tell you. You need Oculus Quest. No tv, PS4, or wires hanging. It's perfect for my situation for sure. I do not want my kids into the games yet since they are very young. So this unite gives me the opportunity to play on my time alone away from kids. I got 128Gb for a very good reason. More space and more apps and games. The graphics are amazing and easy to setup. Netflix and YouTube is my buddies. I have to admit, I do look like an idiot in front of wife when I play zombie game lol. But hey...it's not my fault. Video game is in my blood since Atari came out 1987.

The Oculus Quest is a fantastic console that everyone needs to try.  I've been holding off with buying a VR headset due to the cables and other sensors that were primarily required.The Quest is a standalone headset that makes it extremely portable and easy to use both with games/apps that are designed for moving and standing/sitting.Only issue I've had so far is that the back straps make the back of my head burn and it hurts quite bad after about 40 minutes of playing. Other people who have tried it have not noticed this issue so I believe it is due to the size or shape of my head. I'm planning on purchasing an accessory to mitigate this problem.Also speaking of accessories, I highly recommend purchasing one or two silicone face covers for the headset. The default foam absorbs sweat and makes it pretty gross however the silicone covers go right over top and makes cleaning sweat easy and it is still comfortable.Can't wait for more games to be added!

Before anything else, know that you need a device to setup this unit (tablet or phone).  If you want to change users or if you lose/damage the device it was connected to and need to make a change a factory reset is required.Good unit if you don't want to invest in a computer that can run VR properly. The ability to take it anywhere is great and setting up a gardien boundary on the fly is easy.You are restricted to what it can play however and it does often has tracking issues when your controllers are close to your body.The only thing I can say however is that I will never buy another Oculus again (I personally use the rift and this was for my mother).  With the mandatory Facebook account moving forward and everyone needing a facebook account connected by 2023, I who doesn't like social media will never be using another Oculus again.  I suggest all others do the same.  Shame since it's great technology.

I LOVE this VR. The portability is amazing. As long as you have floor space (if for playing in stationary mode) and internet you can play anywhere. It's a great option for people without a gaming computer or gaming system. I'm happy with the selection of games although I am not a big gamer so am not sure what other systems offer.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking to try out VR on a bit more of a budget. It's worth getting rechargeable batteries for the remotes! I find I can get about 2-3 hours of play time with the headset before it needs charging. I did buy a battery pack to charge it while playing, but haven't put it to use yet.

The wireless nature of the Oculus Quest makes it ideal for the most intense workouts. The great thing about the platform is that the games are super cheap compare to other gaming platforms. Although the VR games are fun we have been predominately using it as a workout platform with BoxVR and SuperNatural. We are a puddle of sweat after just 30 minutes of either game and it is much more entertaining than both our treadmill and elliptical machine which cost three times as much as the Oculus Quest.I wish they would improve the screen resolution and battery life but other than that it is the perfect workout machine.

I originally bought this to use a tool for pre-visualizing an architectural space for a project I'm working on. For those purposes, it's great! It's something I can take around with me, show to clients, and use as a way to visualize media within it. As a side benefit, I got to play some of the games and I'll admit it's the most fun I've had gaming in a long time. It's surprisingly immersive and swinging around a light sabre deflecting laser blasts is amazing. The freedom to move around a room is great and surprisingly accurate. Downsides are that it feels heavy after an hour, it's a one-person game (not social), the right speaker sometimes buzzes but it's solved with a reboot so probably a software glitch, the resolution feels low. But overall I'm optimistic that eventually they'll solve these problems and give us a VR experience we can just wear contacts with right?

For about an hour I thought the product was “neat”. Then that ended. This item is disappointing. Only a small number of software items are available. The video quality of the games/apps is very limited. While it does not promise HD, the quality is below SD when watching Netflix. For games and VR experiences, the graphics are no better than those seen in the late 1990’s. I regret buying it. It’s uncomfortable and heavy. VR hasn’t done well because of tech like this.

I was told that they found an old VR Quest, unfortunately it did qualify for a refund They had stopped the investigation from going on with the search  I talked to a supervisor by the name of Conni and that she would send me an email with all the information I needed for an appeal.  What I received was an email for a survey of her people which I completed honestly. The oculus was worth $699.99ca.

I wouldn't recommend buying an Oculus headsets given the current requirement to associate the headset with a facebook account. This is rather annoying as when I first bought the headset you dodn't need to associate a facebook account with Oculus. Now you must...It's rather annoying for people like me who have no interest in being part of the facebook community. Facebook is also banning accounts that they deem to be ""fake"". So if like me you create an account with the sole purpose of being about to use your Oculus you run the risk of getting randomly banned in FaceBook. Should this happen you lose access to your entire library of purchases. People are complaining they have been banned and not really able to get unbanned. Crappy business practices. I mean the headset is decent but FaceBook policies are going to drive this brand into the ground.

This thing completely blew my mind as well as everyone i was able to show it to due to the great protability i can just put it in my bag and bring it over to a friend's house which is unparalleled so far in the market. It works amazingly well and i still don't get how such a small machine is able to run vr games. I could write a novel about all the things you can do with it but nobody wants to read that so i'll make a small list of pros and cons.Pros: 2-3 hours of playtime with a single charge and it charges back up to full in an hour and a half to two hours.Want a drink? Just walk beyond  the guardian you created and the outside cameras will seamlessly show you a view of the room as if you didn't even have a headset on.The wireless nature of it allows you to run around in a vr universe like you were actually in it and it is SO immersive.Cons: I have had it crash during a game only once in 3 days of almost non stop playing so i don't even consider this as a con as you can just boot it again in a few seconds and keep on playing but had to mention it.

Other than the fact that the VR set weighs enough to hurt your neck.. it's a great product .. much better than any other VR out there .. previous to buying this item, we bought play stations VR and honestly can say that I wish I would have bought Oculus beforehand... and could have eliminated the playstation VR purchase .. nothing compares to the oculus!!

Wow.  This product is fabulous.  It delivers.  It works.  It’s easy to get into—excellent tutorial for using the controllers.  I like the apps (a bit costly compared to iOS apps).  The immersive experience of VR bowled over me, my spouse and many friends.  This is a next step in VR and human interaction with computers.  I hope you might enjoy one as much as I am enjoying mine.

I'd been waiting for years for VR to mature to the point where it would be affordable and of high quality. The Oculus Quest is both of those and I am most pleased with my purchase! Setup was super easy and the lack of cords is great! The environment is so immersive that you often forget where you are!If you've been on the fence about getting a VR device, check out the Quest... I wasn't disappointed!

I bought my quest at the end of January. Since the first week of use its has had issues with crashing and tracking. It bricked the first week and after a factory reset I got it working again. Now only 4 months later it has completely stopped working and nothing I do can get it to restart.This is an 800 dollar product plus all the money I have spent on games and apps. I have never owned anything this buggy and defective and given the price I am honestly stunned.I am waiting on Oculus consumer support to get back to me. I will update this review based on there response but as it stands I am very disappointing.

Great family fun. Let me start off by saying I’m not a gamer. I’m sure the graphics would be better on some of the tethered units but the portability and ease of use is a huge advantage. Right out of the box you basically just have to instal some batteries in the controllers and you’re good to go. I don’t have much to compare it to but from what I hear from my kids the graphics are close to what you get from similarly priced tethered units. The selection of games is vast and seems to be growing. Since purchasing the unit about 3 weeks ago the store has already added several games. My only wish would be that the nature scenery on some games and movie resolution was on par with my TV. I’m sure we’ll get there some day.

The only reason for the 4 stars is that a battery in one of the hand controls exploded.  The controller still works and we were able to get the battery area cleaned out.  It's not something I necessarily blame Oculus for because it was the battery but if they see others having the same issue, they may want to consider using a different brand of battery.  Other than that, my son has been enjoying this since Christmas and I don't see him stopping anytime soon!

It is a wonderful product. Everyone who has used it has had a wonderful time. The intro game is very good for people understanding the controller and introducing them to 360 degree play and grabbing stuff. The game selection is good. However, sometimes they can get a bit pricy for what they are. BeatSaber is a great game for getting people moving, also look up how to add custom songs. It adds hours of play time. Don't Stop Talking and No One Dies is a great 2 player game. Where you have to defuse a bomb. It's a lot of fun, and thats definitely my girlfriends favorite. Beyond this there are all levels of intensity of games. Also RecRoom which is a free game has a lot of different content and is great exposure to online multiplayer.

I'm not a gamer but VR has certainly changed that. The experience is like no other and it's quite easy and quick to forget you are in a game. As a horror movie fan, I love all the zombie games! It's a very entertaining way to have some fun at home or with friends. And the portability and ease of use of the unit itself is the best feature in my opinion. The bigger the space you have, the better the experience so you can move. However even in a small space, it's amazing. Highly recommended!

Have been using this for about a month and so far quite pleased with this product. It feels like having a VR arcade right at home.The headset fits nicely and doesn't come off when moving around. The tracking is accurate and only needs to be reset when you move the headset out of your designated zone or go into a different location. The only negative I can think of are the two controllers taking up a lot of battery power. Or maybe I just got cheap batteries when I bought it. Overall very happy with the product.

I've only ever owned google cardboard and while that's pretty neat it is no where near perfected. I think my expectations were very low going into this headset.The set up is super simple and if you're like me you've downloaded the Oculus app before your headset even arrived. I was able to set up my account and purchase titles without actually having my Quest headset. Once it arrived, the set up was simple and charging time took about an hour (it was at 56% out of the box).I can't say it's the most comfortable thing to wear, I do find myself fiddling with it durring use but it's never become so uncomfortable that I had to remove it. When I say it's not comfortable, I mean it's heavy and therefore needs to be pretty tight against your face.The tutorials for Quest blew me away. ""First steps"" and ""first contact"" are the titles used to teach you how to move and interact in this new VR world. They're so fun that I often laughed out loud and even after a couple days, I still go back to them just to be able to dance with the robot or play with butterflies again.There's about a dozen free titles in the Quest store so far. The virtual pet is pretty awesome and there's also demo's for a few of the higher priced games like Beat Sabre. The best free app in my opinion is YouTube, they have a huge selection of 360 and 3D videos and relaxation experiences. In the Youtube settings you can set your screen format to curved and watch all your Google play movies on the equivalent of an iMAX screen!There's about 30 or 40 paid apps, 3 days post-launch, they're adding more daily it seems. The price range is from about $11.99 -$35 CAD plus tax. There's one app that's $46 (Orbus VR reborn).  Considering that I still pay $80 for a new Xbox one Game, I find these titles really affordable.My home is pretty crowded with furnishings and obstacles but as long as you have at least 2 metre by 2 metre spot somewhere, you'll be fine and the embedded guardian system keeps you safe by warning you when you even come near a boundary line. There's many titles that can also be played in the seated position, like Thumper, Bait, Netflix, YouTube and more.  The biggest area it can zone for play is 25×25 although this might be expandable in developer mode (I haven't tried. Some popular Youtubers would have you believe that you can play outside in daylight but this system is recommended only for indoor use and exposing the lenses to direct sunlight can damage them.The battery life probably depends on what type of title you're playing but on average I'm getting about 3 hours before running low (10%). I don't love the short battery life but I understand it. I'll just have to make sure I charge it after each use. The manual says not to use the headset while plugged in but then they give a 10 ft charging cable....The speaker sound is good in my opinion but if you want a more immersive experience you can buy custom made Quest ear buds from Oculus for about $70 but they can only be used with this system. I'm using a pair by ""Shure"" but any earbuds will likely work.I am truly awe struck by how this little headset can transform my home into a whole new world. It really is amazing that I can be in the smallest room but feel like I'm at the beach or that I can be flying a spaceship in my hallway. It's just incredible how immersive most of the titles are.I'm actually quite prone to motion sickness so I was a little concerned about how I was going to manage but overall, I faired very well. The only title so far to make me queasy was ""epic roller coasters"" but considering that coasters also make me queasy in real life, I think I'll forgive that.I've bought many gaming systems for my boys throughout the years (Xbox, Nintendo, Sony) and this system is at least a couple hundred dollars more than the most expensive system I've bought but knowing what I know now after using it; it's worth every single penny.

 I’ve been monitoring VR headset prices for a couple years now and had been considering buying a headset to connect with my computer to improve non-VR games (i.e. racing/driving games, to allow me to “look around” to see my surroundings). The Oculus Quest is a stand-alone VR – no computer connection required – however there is at least one app which also lets you connect to your PC… scroll through my review for more details.** See attached short video demo where I show the basic layout of the Oculus OS – note that there are some jitters as a result of casting – in-headset quality is much better and jitter-free **EDIT - MARCH 2020 - Oculus released Oculus Link which allows you to connect your Quest to a computer, allowing it to act like a traditional VR headset linked to a computer. Note that a high-bandwidth (5Gbps) USB-C data cable is required. See “CONNECTING TO A PC VIA OCULUS LINK” section for more details.WHATS INCLUDEDThe Oculus ships in what is probably the nicest electronics packaging I’ve ever seen (though I wish they spent a tiny bit more money to make it a reusable travel case!). Included is a headset with 3-point head strap, a headset spacer for use if you wear glasses, two controllers (one for each hand), two AA batteries (one for each controller), a USB-C charger, and an approximately 10’ long USB-C to USB-C charging cable. A small reference guide and a safety/warranty manual are also included.GETTING STARTEDPut a battery into each controller. Put on the headset, and press the power button (on the front right side of the headset) to get going. Make sure both controllers are in front of you for the headset to “see”. The Oculus will guide you through headset adjustment and take you through a couple of tutorials to help you set the room size (“Oculus Guardian”) and understand how the controls work. I found myself getting lost in the menus at first, but then realized that the thumb button on the left controller is a menu button that helps me backtrack within the OS as required.TRACKING AND CONTROLSTracking of both the controllers (relative to the headset) and the headset (relative to the room) are incredible. Button layouts on the controls are well thought out and intuitive, especially the “grab” buttons activated by each middle finger wrapped around the remote. The joysticks are convenient for menu navigation, even though I normally simply point and click. In some instances, I find the large loops at the front of the remotes annoying (especially when reeling in a fishOCULUS GUARDIAN (boundaries)When in a new area, the system asks you to set play boundaries to prevent you from straying from the open part of the room. Part of this setup has you confirm floor height, and you essentially draw your play boundary around a superimposed version of the room you’re in. There is no upper boundary, so I recommend turning off ceiling fans and stay away from doorways or other low items in your house.VISUAL QUALITYThe Oculus features a resolution of 1440x1600 per eye. This is better than all other mobile VR headsets currently available, though there are tethered (to PC) models with much higher resolution. Most Oculus games currently on the store have cartoony graphics, and the Oculus pulls them off really well. Despite the high resolution, when watching even the highest quality videos, pixels are noticeable – presumably due to the ultra-close proximity of the display to your eyes.COMFORTThe headset is very well padded, and even the straps are made from a pleasant soft plastic. Still, all of the weight is at the front of the headset, and I find it moderately uncomfortable to wear for any amount of time. I also find that the headset seems to push my eyes together a bit (almost as if it is too narrow for my face) – I now use the glasses spacer despite not wearing glasses as that seems to help a little. I also relaxed the straps which has helped. Still, I wish the unit was more comfortable.BATTERY LIFEWe are finding that recharges are required after every 3 hours of use, and the battery in each controller diminishes around 7% per hour. Even though they don’t recommend it, you can play with the headset charging. One thing to point out – you have to really press the cable into the headset. A couple times I left it ‘charging’ only to come back and realize it hadn’t charged at all because the cable wasn’t firmly in place.GAMES AND FUN FACTORRegardless off everything stated so far, this device creates a super-immersive environment and offers several different types of games… we are likening it to the original Wii – fun games and novel non-conventional controls. Currently, my favourite game is Bait (a fishing game), while my girlfriend can’t get enough of Beat Sabre. There are some free games (including Bait), but most sell for $20-$35 Canadian. The store has a somewhat limited selection, but will presumably grow over time. The compact footprint also makes this ideal to bring along to the cottage to keep for a rainy day.BROADCASTING TO A PHONE OR TVThe Quest supports broadcasting to another device so others can see what you’re up to. Unfortunately, not all apps support steamingCONNECTING TO A PC VIA OCULUS LINKOculus Link allows you to connect the Quest to a computer via a USB-C cable. Once connected, it acts like a more traditional VR headset, and is compatible with Oculus Rift games, and Steam VR games (Steam VR isn’t officially supported by Oculus). Note that a high-quality USB-C cord supporting 5Gbps data speeds is required – none of mine were recognized by the Oculus PC app as “acceptable” so I bought a 10’ long USB extension cable Amazon#B00C7SA21U and a 3’ long USB-A to USB-C cord Amazon#B01GN0M6NE for a total of $30. Once set up, this connection is reliable, though I had a bit of a hard time getting some games up and running. I now use my Quest when playing Project Cars 2 on Steam, though I find I have a tendency to get ‘car sick’ on some tracks in VR.CONNECTING TO A PC WIRELESSLYAlthough the Oculus Quest doesn’t support direct PC streaming, there is an app for that. Install ALVR on both the Oculus and your computer, and you can play SteamVR games through your Quest. Note that it is critical that you have a strong 5Ghz connection for this to work properly. I tried with a lower bandwidth connection (I’d set up my Oculus on my 2.4Ghz network for better range throughout the house) and it was unplayable. There are some video demos and website that show you how to set up ALVR – it is somewhat complicated, but took me under an hour to set up including research.OVERALLThis is a really impressive system – tracking is flawless, and the boundaries system allows you to immerse yourself without worrying about your surroundings. The variety of games is good (and improving), and gameplay is a lot of fun. On the downside, realize that this system is best suited for semi-cartoony games, and that the headset isn’t the most comfortable to wear, especially for extended periods of time.

Using this Oculus Quest All-in-one VR Gaming Headset for the first time is like a right of passage - it's like something that is so hard to describe - you just have to experience it (like a first kiss, or a bit of pizza, etc).  The system invokes a similar feeling as to when I saw the Avatar movie in 3D - like, wow, here is the future. In a similar way, this Oculus system is nothing but impressive in almost every way.I have yet to purchase any additional games other than what is pre-loaded, but I'll update my review after that. For now, however, the pre-loaded adventures are fun and breathtaking enough for most people just starting out. The system truly is plug-and-play - once you've defined a virtual boundary in your room (the system will walk you through it) you're ready to go. I like how you can duck ""in and out"" of the virtual reality - it helps with anxiety, potential dizziness, etc. Just knowing there's a ""safe, normal zone"" allows you to immerse yourself even more. You don't need that much living room space to be able to use this - I have maybe 2 square metres where I initially set it up and although the system said it was better if I had more, I could use it no problem (both sitting down and standing up).The fact that there are absolutely no wires at all removes the barrier to entry that previous VR systems have experienced. This particular Oculus Quest All-in-one VR Gaming Headset is truly a wonder. The only drawback I have experienced is that the headset is a little heavy and uncomfortable after a really short time.  I also found I couldn't ever get the 'crown' part of the headgear to sit on my  head properly, so there was always a slight wiggle, no matter how much I adjusted all the settings. But these points are minor.You can even watch Netflix immersed in VR. It is kinda trippy sitting in the massive living room of what appears to be a designer ski chalet in Switzerland (but the headset is too heavy to keep on that long for me, and the picture quality isn't as good as your regular TV). But still, it's fun.The bottom line is that this is simply one of the most exhilarating things you can do without leaving your living room. It's something the whole family can enjoy (dancing with a robot - got my heart beat up haha, throwing virtual paper airplanes, etc). Don't hesitate to get this if you're at all curious - your curiosity will be rewarded.

The Oculus Quest is an incredibly unique device.  It is a VR gaming/entertainment platform with its ecosystem of games as well as apps.  This is not really a new thing since there are many many VR platforms today as such (for example, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive family, Nintendo/Sony VR, Google Daydream VR... the list goes on).While most VR platforms require a PC/MAC,  console, or usage of a phone,  what sets this one apart is that it is more or less a stand alone system .  You really only need the a cellphone (ios/android) to setup/pair it for the first time.  Thereafter you can use the Quest completely stand alone and buy apps within the virtual world via wifi on the VR headset.  It is a truly exceptional all-in-one package.  Note that Oculus has something called ""Oculus Go"" as well but this is really just a stationary product similar to a Google phone with a Google daydream VR headset -- there is no positional tracking.  This is an actual gaming  device, it tracks 3D position and location via cameras on the outside of the headset.  You do not need any sensors other than whats on your head.I'm not a huge gamer but I'm fascinated with VR in general.  I love the tech.  I have tried HTC vive and vivepro and Google daydream for kicks.  I always chickened out on buying the HTC vive system because its a high cost of entry with the requirement of a powerful PC/videocard setup.  Enter, the Oculus Quest. At 600$CAD,  you have everything.  No need to buy a PC.  No wires/tethers.  Everything is all in one, freedom of movement in a real world space.I will be up-front though.  This is obviously NO WHERE near as compelling with  full PC setups with powerful graphics cards.  To compare with those systems is completely missing the point.  The selling point here is the portability and simplicity and affordability.++1. Setup of this system is absolutely crazy simple.  You use Oculus app  to find the sytem and configure the wifi , pair the controllers, create the account / paypal for payment.  Youre done.  The only time you really need the Oculus app is if you want to ""cast"" the players view, onto your own phone to see what he's doing and play along by viewing.++2.  Once you're paired up and setup,  you are faced with a really useful tutorial that gets you oriented with how it works and how to use the controllers on your hands.  Doing this activity basically makes you a pro with the controls.  Very fun and effective Out-of-box experience.  In fact, i made my 8 year old son go through this tutorial and thats all he needed to acclimate to the system -- by the way, my son has played HTC VIVE games too so perhaps he's somewhat familiar.3. I'm not totally well versed with all of the VR gaming eco systems out there but as I was navigating the store, I was not too impressed with the amount of selection out  there for the Quest so far.  However I'm going to admit I've not purchased any games from there yet.  I have played all of the demos that it comes with and i'm pretty impressed.--4. Fitment is somewhat mediocre.  The headset is not too comfortable for me.  It has three main points of adjustments via velcro.  I really wish the velcro were replaced by a tension based push/pull.  Velcro makes it tedious to adjust with every head that tries it on.  I've had this demo'd with 5 other people and using velcro on and off constantly, i'm just worried about wearing it out , and secondly, i'm  having to spend a lot of time getting the fitment right every single time I use the device.  The weight of the device is heavily front-loaded -- so games where your head needs to move briskly ,  i  found it not secure and tends to swing out easily.  Boxing games really show this annoyance of front-heavy unbalance.  One other point to make, I wear glasses.  Quest has an extra plastic accessory to increase depth for your glasses but I never had to use it.  My glasses fit OK as is. The problem for me is,  the nose part is way too large.  I can press my face right in and tighten it  up but still the nose part is larger than my nose that it creates a hole and i can peek downward and see real world, in addition it leaks light in to vr.  When i see the real world whilst playing a game in virtual world, it kind of ruins the dream world.  I think for my nose, i need to stuff a black cloth to fill up the space.  If you have a large nose and a high bridge , then perhaps this isnt a problem.++5. I love the charging with usbC connector.  ALL connections should be USBC directionless in 2019.  Charging is pretty fast.  The charge lasts a good amount of time -- at least for me, it outlasted my physical ability to keep slashing blocks with a light saber :)++6. Gaming experience.  I  will recommend a few games here that you should try in this order in order to ease you into VR.  The first game to try is a  free one called Bait.  It's a funny fishing game.  As one would expect, its a slow paced game with small missions to catch certain fish, gain money, buy better fishing gear.  This is a nice first game because it gets your acquainted with the entire system and navigation.  It is a stationary game too so youre not all disoriented as a first experience.  Then you should try a demo version of Beat Saber.  This is incredibly fun.  This one starts you off into more movement and you really get to experience some sweat:).  This isnt really graphics intensive game since it's just blocks racing to your face and you need to dodge, slice and move your way around blocks.  Your controller is two light sabers used to slice blocks with the beat of the music (much like  DDR).  To intensify the experience a bit more,  try some games with more movement around a 3D space.  I downloaded the demo for Creed.  This boxing game will get you tired in 30 seconds.  It's merely a boxing game where you use your controllers to box/block and youre able to move around the ring and experience actual spacial gaming.  I'm impressed with this game for the most part but here i found the system lags.  I often found myself completely disoriented because it was fairly glitchy where I was suddenly moved to random areas of the ring.  I found that swinging for a punch was a bit laggy and it threw off the game experience.  So unsatisfied by Creed, i found another game that was just as immersive but actually worked well.  Space Pirate.  I really really enjoy this one because it is so real.  You feel completely immersed and stressed in the game because of the overwhelming enemies surrounding you.  The best way to describe this is,  space invaders, except youre the guy shooting at dozens of ships attacking you at the same time in 3d space, dodging and shooting these enemies as quickly and efficiently as possible.  I found zero glitches with this game and the system performed excellent.  One last game i'll bring up is not really a game but you shouuld definitely try this because it brings out another thrill with VR gaming:  Epic roller coaster.  This is more or less a stationary game where your sit down and ride different rollercoasters.  You know youre just on your sofa but when you are in VR, your mind is absolutely convinced youre going through a rollercoaster and you experience stomach butterflies during vicious sections of the ride.  This is definitely an essential experience to fulfill VR ride.  That was just a good sample of games you should try if youre first time VR user.  This proves to me that the Quest is indeed a viable product that really  checks off all the ingredients of a great system:  price, simplicity, gameplay experience.--7.  As i said in the beginning, this should not be compared with high-end VR systems with dedicated PC's.  Having understood that, I will say I noticed the obvious ""screen door"" effect.  Every game I play, its obvious, however i'm going to say this wasnt really distracting when you're already immersed.--8. I've also tried some youtubeVR videos.  I will be honest, they werent really impressive because the resolution is not great on the headset.  When showing real life videos , its different because your expectations are different than  CG based gaming.  I would also not really impressed with Netflix VR for the same reason.  Here is something to I found really annoying.  You cant watch netflix or videos when the room you are in is pitch dark .  This is because you are required to confirm a stationary ""safe"" wall and 4 cameras outside the VR headset is tracking if youre away from the safe zone.  If you are in a pitch dark room (say, in bed watching a movie), then the cameras are not able to see anything outside, so the system shuts down and warns you about it.  You have to turn on some lights in the outside real world, in order to watch a movie on netflix....9.  Ultra convenient audio and controllers.  I'm really happy to have built-in speakers on the VR headset.  It really really is awesome to not have to wear another headphone with your VR head gear.  The audio obviously isnt the most outstanding sound but it is good enough to keep you engaged.  Controllers in both hands are ultra comfortable and all the buttons are exactly where i want them to be.  I sometimes forget i'm holding it and youre inclined to drop them --- which is why you should put the wrist loop on!  I actually wish i had the option to plug in your own earphones or headphones so it doesnt disturb outside.10. Cost.  So this is approximately 600CAD.  This isnt cheap but considering the alternative, where you need to likely spend 1500-2000+ on a pc on top of you  VR goggles, i would say this is definitely worthy of recommendation.  If youre a casual gamer and casual VR user,  you would be hard pressed to convince your spouse to spend 3000 on a VR setup,  so i'm going to highly recommend this one.  It's a lower financial commitment and you end up with a really really excellent, stand-alone, fully portable gaming setup.Youre going to love this VR system if you are looking to enter the VR world.  You dont need anything else.  I'll be sure to update this review once I have a few more games to experience.

An incredible stand-alone VR system

2022-05-22 13:16:27.146910,"
I've only ever owned or tried the Nintendo Virtual Boy and Google Cardboard. Obviously the Virtual Boy is now significantly outdated and I was never a fan of it with just red and black colours. Google Cardboard also never was the greatest for me as I found the cardboard a bit awkward to use but I'd sometimes see some cool results with my cellphone at a cheap cost for the cardboard! In comparison, the Oculus Quest All in one VR system is absolutely incredible. The price tag is quite substantial, but you do get what you pay for as it's still technology that's in the new and cool phase in that not many have experienced. I have the Oculus app but the app is more focused for the Oculus Go or Oculus Rift. The Oculus Quest is standalone without needing a PC or anything, and it is easy to pickup and play. It's jaw dropping while using it with no headaches or nausea and I usually get those symptoms easily from even reading in the car, but the VR is an experience like no other. Normally I'd say this is priced too high at almost $700 MSRP, but given the experience, replayability and quality, it's hard for Oculus to probably price this lower but this headset is something I'd pay about $500 for in terms of value--if you can afford it at regular price, go for it and you won't be disappointed but for most consumers like me it's a bit pricey and we'll have to wait for the price to fall a bit before it's more adopted.

INTRODUCTION:Though high performance VR experience is available for years, so far was not for everyone. You need to buy and expensive VR hardware and matching high performance PC and both combined can cost so much that it will be out of reach for the most people. Oculus has been making high performance VR hardware for long time and this time what have done with introduction of Oculus Quest is game changing. Oculus Quest is reasonably priced high performance VR set which is fully standalone - you do not need PC. There are no wires and no additional hardware requirement. It features high performance hardware that rivals many more expensive PC powered options at reasonable price point. Without doubt Oculus Quest sets itself for all-in-one high performance virtual reality system for everyone.DESIGN:If you ask me how is the design, I have just one word - Outstanding. This set came in stunning packaging and as soon as I took it out of box there was a huge WOW coming out from me. Oculus Quest is probably the most attractive VR set I have seen. It is surprisingly compact and light weight as well.It feels extremely comfortable to wear- thanks to luxurious fabric and foam lining around. Among the lots of VR headsets I have tried, this is probably most comfy. Straps are easy to adjust and stays securely attached to head. Overall balance and weight distribution while wearing this head set is very good. Like most headsets, there is some weight on front which causes some pressure on back of head and chin if worn for the long time, but it is natural and it goes away quickly once headset is removed.This set contains Quest Headset, touch Controllers, Power adapter and charging cable, glass spacer, batteries and instructions. The glass spacer is great for eye glass wearer and since I am eye glass we’re, it is very welcome accessory.Two Controllers comes feels high quality and each one has clickable joysticks,  trigger button and few buttons on top. Overall controllers feel ergonomic and comfortable to hold and play.I highly recommend to go through Quest tutorial session which will walk you through how controllers work and what each button does.Set up process was very quick and easy. There is no lengthy set up process here. Just charge the set and initiate quick set up with mobile application and follow instructions. .Completely wire-free design of this set means lots of freedom and play. Overall, everything feels premium here.PERFORMANCE AND FEATURES:Overall performance of Quest system is mind-blowing. Overall VR experience looks crisp and clear, immersive and very realistic - thanks to OLED display with 1440x1600 per eye resolution running at 72Hz and Snapdragon 835 processor. Processor is less powerful than Rift which is little disappointing, but I did not feel lakeshores of power anywhere in my tests.Movement tracking is excellent in Quest - thanks to Oculus Insight technology, which uses ultra wide-angle sensors on the side of the headset, as well as computer vision algorithms, to translate your movements into VR. There are four sensors on the plastic faceplate that track your movements for a full six degrees of freedom. It should be noted that this is Oculus’s first all-in-one headset that offer six degree of freedom and room scale movement.One of the great feature for Quest is it’s built-in safety system which allows you to draw safety lines in the room, so that you do not hit walls, furniture or TV. Once you put headset on, you will see real world around you though it’s sensors and you can draw boundaries around the room using controller and it’s amazing that Quest will remember your play space for the next time - Very intuitive.Also quest can be used in very small spaces because it is wire free and PC free system. Although minimum recommended gameplay area of 2 meters 2 meters, it is possible to play in smaller space.Speakers are integrated into the strap close to ears which means you do not need head phones. This means cutting one more cord. Built-in speakers offers decent sound and together with stunning visuals it offers immersive experience. Do not expect sound of high quality premium  earbuds though - sound is decent but not outstanding.You can download games though mobile device application of VR menu. There are large number of games that will be available at launch time (about 50) and the number is constantly growing. Considering popularity of Oculus it is certain to have lots of games in near future.Battery life was slightly over 2 hours in my test which is quite good as nobody would play for more than that time continuously. Charging time was rather quick-only 2 hours.CONCLUSION:Quest is affordable but game changing high performance Virtual Reality Set that will satisfy everyone whether you are just curious about VR, a beginner or causal gamer or serious gamer.  Cost is still high for many people who are just curious, but if you compare PC powered options, it is still cheaper. If you do not want to spend this much, Oculus Go is another great option to consider. Overall, Quest offers lots of fun and serious entertainment.

I am a newcomer to VR, having only ever used it as a part of an escape room that I visited, however I was very interested to try this VR headset at home, especially considering the fact that you don't need a specific PC to use this. This is an all-in-one device.This was very easy to set up right out of the box. Even with having to read the instructions I was set up and ready to go in under a half hour. The game play and graphics of this system truly blew me away! So did the battery life- one charge lasted me over two hours while I was initially trying it out and it wasn't even fully depleted when I charged it again.I can highly recommend this VR system, even if you are a newbie to VR like I am. It is easy to use and to understand, and you don't need anything specific to get this up and running, like a fancy PC. I can't speak to how this would be if you were not new to VR, but I love how well this works and so do my kids, who are also new to virtual reality. This product exceeded my initial expectations when it came to playability as well as function.

I am a complete newbie to VR headsets and gaming and was hesitant to try it out. The Oculus Quest has completely blown me out of the water and I'm excited to keep exploring what it can offer. The start-up out of the box is very quick and user friendly. Just download the Oculus app to your smartphone, charge up the headset and get started. It will walk you through set up and take you through a quick tutorial before you land at your VR 'home' environment (which I wish was what my actual home looked like). The set-up walk-through includes info on adjusting the fit of the headset, what the controller buttons do, setting up your guardian safe play area (which you can adjust as needed) and how to interact with the VR environment. After that, you download games either through the app on your phone or directly through the headset.  You can use a facebook account or sign up with a unique login to start playing. A few free play and demo games will get you started, like fishing, roller coaster rides, a basic hero quest, and some chat room style games. I have yet to dip in to the paid games but I am excited to do so.  The selection does feel a bit limited at this point, but what is available promises many, many hours of immersive entertainment each, so I doubt I'd get bored. You can even access popular apps from within the Oculus like Youtube, Netflix, Twitch, etc. There's even a game that allows people to explore google street view anywhere in the world from the VR environment - something I had thought would be really cool and am super stoked actually exists. The VR isn't 100% perfect - expect some glitches (I've run into a couple) but I still think it's a fantastic gadget and the potential for expansion is huge. I have a couple of qualms with the fit and weight of the headset, but hopefully I will get used to it. It does feel a bit heavy and creates a pressure-groove on my face after wearing it even for 10-15 minutes. At first it can cause dizziness and nausea due to feeling disoriented, but I expect this dissipates as you get acclimatized to the experience. The safety warnings say as much, and recommend easing into it with short sessions to start. I am very impressed with how easy the Oculus Quest was to pick up and use, and anyone who I've plunked it on and told to run the demo has also been very taken away by it. I also love that it is 100% wireless and stand-alone. The battery life leaves a bit to be desired - I estimated a couple hours or so, but I suppose a person could play with the power cord plugged in if they needed to. All in all, a pretty awesome gaming experience that I'm glad I was able to get to try out!

Lives up to the hype! Excellent implementation and makes it easy to share the experienceVR is an amazing idea! Amazing, but it’s implementation can have unexpected complications.  I jumped into VR back in 2015 but it didn’t live up to the hype, and it came with unexpected consequences (motion sickness), and was hemmed up by a corded connection. The cored connection, and external hardware also made the experience cumbersome, and soon gave up on the experience, and couldn’t get past the motion sickness.  I could go on for a couple pages about the pros/cons, etc. but the biggest issue was being connected by a cord, and being forced to essentially sit on a couch in a relatively stationary position while seeing all the virtual motion that would make me turn green in minutes and would last for hours – horrible experienceHowever, the Quest has COMPLETELY changed the VR experience for me and I’m blown away! BLOWN .. A…. WAY… AMAZING!!!!!  The freedom of motion and cordless connection is liberating, and allows me to move freely and in a 360 fashion that has virtually eliminated the motion sickness issues.  Because my motions are in synch with what I’m seeing (eyes and inner ear getting the same message).  This is a game changer for me.  The game experience, and implementation of the tech is spot on.  You can setup a virtual fence to keep you in a safe area, and the system tracks really well.  It’s not butter smooth, but it’s pretty good, and I’ve got no real complaints or criticisms.  It’s amazing, the only negatives associated with the limited number of games available, which is somewhat limited by the cpu/gpu horsepower of this self-contained design (mobile phone tech), but these are constraints of the time, and are not really valid criticisms.Lastly, the Quest makes sharing the VR experience with others easy – and trust me, this is an experience you’ll want to share with others. You’ll be amazed and you’ll naturally want others to experience it to.  The size and portability allow you to play anytime you want, or even take it with you.  However, it’s limited to indoors play only – you can’t take to a park on a sunny day, because the external camera’s that track your environment and head movement can be damaged by direct sunlight.So in summation – Yes, finally a VR experience that lives up to the hype and is well suited to sharing the experience.Ps - my kids love it too and they're always bugging me to play.  Doesn't take long to eat up the battery life ~2 hrs . Good times ;)

I still need to buy one of my own but luckily for me I do know the quality of the Oculus Quest and that was thanks to the opportunity of being in Defy Reality Ad. I love the fact that you can set up the play area while wearing the headset because you have a visual on exactly where it’s going to be. And it also blew me away that I was able to see through the headset thanks to the sensors and that made following scene directions a lot easier when I was doing the ad. In fact, when I exclaimed that I was able to see through it the camera people and director were “Wait what? You can? Well that will make this a lot easier.” Those photos are me in the Ad, got to do SuperHot VR.

I’ve done a fair bit of VR gaming at local arcades (both regular VIVE-based and custom backpack-based full body VR).  This is the first piece of kit that I’ve purchased, and it is phenomenal.  Some decent games available in all genres, fast/responsive graphics, no room mods needed, no PC needed, no wires.  Gameplay like this, on demand, at home, is a revelation.  The graphics are lower quality than in a high-end tethered VR rig, but you really won’t notice, because the system is so immersive and responsive.  Well worth the money.

Facebook has done an incredible job bringing this headset to the masses. Having a wireless Vive setup at home, the Oculus duplicates the wireless VR immersion at a fraction the costs for the Vive.  You lose out slightly on the graphics and access to the existing Steam library, but the ease of use/setup and the mobility of the Quest more than makes up for it. I highly recommend getting the headset and share the VR experience with your family and friends!

I bought this because I love to share VR with people.  I was hoping for something that required less set-up, and this is mostly a fit.But it HURTS my head.  I'm not prone to headaches or nausea - I use the Oculus Rift every day.  But the Quest is too heavy, and doesn't have facial interface meant to handle the weight.  It digs into my cheekbones, and if I tilt it up off my cheekbones, it's got to be strapped so tight that it hurts my forehead.Pros:- Powerful and beautiful.  It's got great rendering capability, and a great frame rate.- Fantastic display.  Minimum screen door effect, no smearing, high resolution.- Portable. The guardian system is quick to set up, it's tracking from the moment you put it on.- Headset tracking is flawless, and controller tracking is very good even around the edges.- Many of my games transferred over!  I got Robo Recall, Tilt Brush, I Expect You To Die and Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes for free, but I will have to re-purchase Beat Saber, Moss and Super Hot.Cons:- Heavy.  I'm beyond belief how heavy this thing is, and how ""sharp"" the bottom of the facial interface feels.  I won't be able to play this much.  I'm going to have to acclimate or return it, and I honestly wouldn't bet on either outcome.- Short battery life.  It'll outlast a LONG game session, but it won't outlast a road trip, so keep your charger handy.  That being said, it's amazing battery life considering what kind of power this thing has.- Screen sharing isn't very good in quality or reliability, and some games like Beat Saber don't support it.  A wired option would be nice, or a more reliable wireless stream.  I chose this because it's easier to take places and share experiences and ""screen sharing"" was a selling point.  I am disappointed.Also:- The audio is good considering it's not over the ear, but it's a disappointment that it is lacking the quality of an over-the-ear option.- Absolutely TINY game store.  Since the store just opened today, many of the titles are labeled ""Released 2 hours ago,"" so I expect there will be more. The Rift had the same problem, and it quickly improved.

The Oculus Quest is amazing. It has blown me away with its ease of use and attention to detail. This is pretty much the toy I have dreamed of since the rudimentary VR arcade games of the late 1980s. My one minor complaint is that the comfort level is merely satisfactory... I wish it was smaller and lighter, but this is a predictable concern when strapping a powerful game console to your face.SETUP: Within 10 minutes of opening the box, I was walking around inside a virtual world, adapting to my virtual hands by throwing VR paper airplanes and stacking VR blocks. Setup was incredibly quick and easy: download the phone app, put on the Quest, then use a controller to laser-draw a line around the edge of your open play area. All done.PLAY SPACE: Once you define your open play zone, you can walk around inside it safely while wearing Quest. If you approach the edge of the safe zone, the boundary becomes visible as a giant net in space, much like the walls of a Star Trek holodeck. If you reach or step through the boundary/net, there is a cool warning effect and your hand turns red. If you do not quickly return to the safe area, the VR world disappears and is replaced by a live camera view of your real environment. I can not say enough good things about this process/interface: simple, effective, seamless, robust, fun...SUPERB!Oculus recommends an open play space 6.5ft x 6.5ft, just enough to duck and dodge and hide behind cover. With a larger space, you will see the border/net less often. 10x10ft is plenty; I have never wanted to dive on the ground or anything.COMFORT: Quest is my first VR headset. The comfort level is about what I expected: it feels a little awkward, but not too bad, somewhat like a motorcycle helmet. The foam is soft, thick, and comfortable on my face. Adjustable straps on the sides and top (three total) are well-made and easy to adjust to suit my preferred snugness. Still, I am well aware that I have a computer hanging on my face.After about 60 minutes, I started to feel pressure soreness. Perhaps I have the straps too tight, but when I loosen them I fear that the headset may become unstable (shift on my head) if I jump around too much. There is definitely a trade-off here between facial comfort and tightness/stability.I wear prescription glasses. Quest includes a ""spacer"" you can place under the foam to create more space for glasses, and this worked well. My glasses did not interfere with anything.I never noticed any heat from the system, and my face never felt overheated, stuffy, or sweaty.GRAPHICS: The graphics look good, but not jaw-dropping. It feels like a 720p HDTV... plenty of resolution to create impressive visuals and details, especially with cartoony-style environments, but not enough pixels to make you forget you are looking at a video screen. Most importantly, motion was always smooth. I never noticed any stutter or framerate issues. Even fast-moving objects look great, with no ghosting or stuttering.CONCLUSION: Although the visual resolution feels a few years old, the frame rates are smooth, the system stays cool to the touch, and there are no wires to limit your motion. Super easy to use, perfect for travel and sharing. I am completely satisfied. Buy it.

Para todos aquellos que desean integrarse a al mundo de la realidad virtual sin tener que gastar en una pc de gama alta, esté es el mejor dispositivo para hacerlo y lo mejor de todo sin cables.Pros:1-Totalmente stand alone, es decir todo está integrado en el casco.2- tracking excelente.3-Una excelente resolución de pantalla, muy superior inclusive a la de otros dispositivos de gama alta.4- Apps dedicadas a experiencias en realidad virtual, explorador en realidad virtual (Firefox VR).5- Para ser un producto relativamente nuevo, la biblioteca de juegos disponibles en la tienda oculus es muy basta y no superan los 30 USD.6- Al ser usuario también del PSVR puedo decir que aunque los gráficos en video juegos son ligeramente menores, la inmersión es mil veces mejor.7- Tu espacio de juego virtual es tan grande como el espacio en el que te puedas mover. Esto hace al oculus quest el mejor dispositivo vr hasta ahora.8- Puedes activar el modo desarrollador e instalar aplicaciones que no hay en la tienda de oculus.Contras;1- Al tener todo integrado en el visor, hace que todo el peso esté en el frente. Por lo que es algo incomodo para algunas personas después de algunas horas de juego. Pero puede solucionarse comprando algunos accesorios extra.2-Las apps más importantes de oculus go por ahora no son compatibles con el quest. Pero parece ser que pronto cambiará eso.En general es un dispositivo que a mi punto de vista vale la pena tener.

We cough up almost double what US customers are paying, If we paid only $500 - maybe I'd be less likely to point out any flaws. The product is Amazing given that it's wireless HOWEVER, do not expect seamless tracking. If you hold your arms too close to your body, or too far out (wide) tracking is lost.This can be frustrating in games like SuperhotVR or Beat Saber. Controllers burn through batteries quickly, so buy a BIG pack of good quality batteries if you are a daily player. Don't stress when you see Social experiences like AltspaceVR or VtimeXR are not on the store - You CAN sideload them easily and they still work well.VRChat is available, but its pretty average at the moment. Most of the avatars and experience isn't Quest optimized, so half the time you have no idea what is really going on as you are piled in with Rift users.Watching apps like Bigscreen and Netflix seem to be okay plugged into the charger, but I wouldn't do anything more than that. I have experienced some overheating on apps like Angry birds that require more activity. By the time your battery is low, It's probably time to have a break from the virtual world anyway.Do I regret my purchase? No, however, if I had of known these points before I may have leaned more towards the Rift S. The freedom of the Quest is such a great feature though. Its a hard decision even for those who have the PC power for the rift.

Excelente para los que quieran introducirse en VR sin necesidad de tener PC o consolas para hacerlo funcionar. El hecho de que sea completamente wireless es increíble para lograr mayor inmersión, sin tener que estar preocupándose por los cables. El sistema guardián funciona perfecto y es muy versátil.Lo único que comentaría, es que compré la versión de 128gb para no tener que lidiar con problemas de espacio pero la verdad es que con 64 me hubiera sobrado.MUY recomendable

I've had almost every version of Oculus VR and was an early adopter with owning both dev kits as both a gamer and a game designer.The Oculus Quest is a great leap forward and I would 100% recommend this headset to anyone looking to get into VR, you most likely also will only need the 64gb unless you plan on storing moves and such.My biggest issue with this headset would be it's significantly heavier then the Oculus Go and Oculus Rift, the Oculus Go felt as close to wearing nothing as possible, its way more comfortable then the Quest, to the point I forget I'm wearing it sometimes. With the Quest  I am constantly reminded it is on my face, to the point I just have to take it off after 20 minutes or so because it is uncomfortable. It is a very odd problem, because when I hold both of them in my hands the weight doesn't seem that significant, but when I'm wearing the product it is 100% apparent. This being said if you have had little to no experience with the Go or Rift this most likely isn't going to be a big issue.Other than this it is great, the games are amazing, tracking is awesome and being wireless is phenomenal.

Had unit for 2 weeks and it just went dead and stopped working.  Seems to be a known issue with the charger or batteries.  Sadly it happened right after I bought 2 new games, which I've never gotten to play.  This was a bummer, but stuff does break...that's life.  Far worse than it breaking is the complete lack of support, contact info, and follow up they offer.  Basically it's NOTHING!  I've worked in the consumer electronics field for 30+ years and have dealt with hundreds of manufacturers...some great, some just good, and some terrible.  But I've never even remotely had an experience this bad.  They literally have no phone number, only offer a 'ticket based' online portal, and when you reply to their 'support suggestions' they never respond.  It's really unbelievable.  I will waste more time trying to remedy the issue than the thing is worth.  When it works, it's a pretty neat device, but to fail for no reason, with no 'real' support options is pretty bad.

This is an incredible piece of design and engineering and seems like a tipping point for the decades-long developmental effort to bring virtual reality to the consumer market. V.R. has come a long way from Simulacrum-3/Sensorium to the Oculus Quest. We now have a device that finally provides access to the immersive experiences of other lives, fantasies, and insights into perception.The tech is phenomenal. The Quest has two sharp OLED screens that have minimal to no noticeable halo/screen-door effect, they've solved screen fogging, surround sound (headphones optional), excellent field of view (reduced with spacer if wearing glasses), four external cameras on the headset provide spot-on tracking and a setup of the play space that is both easy and surreal. All of this tech is joined by software that delivers quality, engaging and fun experiences (50+ a week in, plus a slew of browser VR games - like moon rider - and films with the YouTube channel). The mobility of the headset allows for immersive environments, free movement, and heavy gaming that can be brought with you almost anywhere (though complete darkness or bright sunlight cause some problems with tracking).There may be detractors, most of whom are likely coming from headsets (or expectations) that are much more expensive and/or which require tethering to a high-end computer. I think this is the leading gadget of the year, if not the start of something bigger, like VR breaking through to the average consumer. The price on the Quest isn't exactly small change, but it is within reach of many more, and as a device designed for mobility, it can potentially introduce many more people to VR.Battery life is about 2-3 hours. Games are curated, hand-picked and continue to baffle me with their level of immersion. Sideloaded apps like vridge promise to allow PC VR games to stream to the headset, while official apps like Virtual PC already allows for 2D streaming of films, games with giant screens in virtual environments.There are of course things that can be improved, but I'm still astounded at what is provided. It's an excellent introduction to VR and will provide many hours, days, weeks, years of enjoyment.

Received my Oculus ""Quest"" this morning.  I bought the Oculus ""Go"" when it first came out, and it was a good product.  But the Oculus ""Quest"" is a MUCH better VR headset.  The controllers make all the difference in the world.  Tons of fun, and I highly recommend it to everyone.  A VR headset like the Quest is also the BEST WAY EVER to watch 3D movies!  I've now watched two 3D movies on the Quest and was blown away.  Especially for people who wear glasses, because trying to wear 3D glasses in a movie theater over existing prescription glasses is a cumbersome nightmare.  Since the Quest basically becomes the 3D glasses and it fits perfectly over prescription glasses it finally makes 3D movie viewing a true joy.  I use the ""Skybox"" VR player on the Quest for 3D movie viewing and it works perfectly.

I’m so disappointed with this product. Spending $499 you would think it would work and have no problems. The first problem is the right built in speaker didn’t work. It had distorted sounds, crackles, and pops. The second problem is the device would get so hot it burned my face, felt like I had a sunburn after an hour of gameplay. The third problem is support, there is none. No number nothing, just an FAQ. Again, so disappointing. Will return and never look back, lost a customer and will think twice before buying any oculus product.

There are already tons of great reviews about all the amazing features of this, so I won't waste your time with going over it all over again. This is the first thing I've ever pre-ordered, It's awesome, I love it, but it hurt my face so I used it for a day and then it sat on my shelf for weeks untouched.So actually while complaining about just that to a friend of mine, I said ""I'm going to screw it into a motorcycle helmet and see if that works"". I was kidding, but about a half second later I totally wasn't.Well, I did that. I didn't even have to screw it in. I didn't even have to use duct tape even though I also bought 2 rolls.I just went down to my local general store, got literally the only motorcycle helmet they had in stock and went home in a vain hope that it would work, but also keeping the receipt.The exact one I got is a model SH-201 Adult MX frenzy grey/black X-large bar code 70258729950. I can't find it for sure on amazon, but I'm sure there are tons of helmets that would do the trick.So I get home, rip the box open and try in absolute vain to stretch the occulus over the helmet. No way is that happening. Nope. I screwed off the little wing thing on the top to see if that would help. Still no go. But then I literally just place the straps in through the goggle space into the actual helmet and push the occulus in just enough to get it snug enough to stay (not hard, at all) and then try it on.Zero weight on your face, the helmet doesn't slip forward, you can even chin strap it in, it doesn't block any of the front cameras, still senses controllers, the speakers function perfectly inside the helmet and you can put on the little chin strap on the helmet to keep it in a totally fixed position if you want.I may or may not go back and get a snazzier helmet at some point in time that is my actual head size, but I mean, right now any one of my friends could get their heads in it too, so I may just leave it be. I'm sure I'll be experimenting. I might even sew it in. We'll see.Keep in mind, I literally just got home and tested this like half an hour ago and after excitedly messaging some friends post-success, I got right on here. So this is still in test mode, but immediately beats previous situation.I was just so excited that I actually get to use it now without face pain that I wanted to share it with the rest of you. Probably will be pulling an all-nighter with this now and I'm thrilled!Good luck, all!Edit: The excitement wore off after a few weeks. I was excited I could use it, but the helmet thing comes with it's own complications.I barely used it and so it wound up being my yankee swap contribution. Disappointed, but now I know to curb my enthusiasm for future VR products.I have a PSVR that I'm happy with and have my eye on a few others.The quest has some amazing features I hope others integrate and/or the face pain thing is worked out in the future. It's really a beautiful piece of technology. But that falls short if using it is deeply uncomfortable.

Wow!I'm very impressed, the last vr I used was the dk2 so jumping to this has been an amazing experience. I'm so glad I purchased this and will be looking at getting a 2nd one for my wife. Lol.Being able to see your hands ingame has been wonderful, the tracking is spot on, the guardian system is so so good. I love playing beat saber and rec room/vr chat.The only complaint I have right now is the left springy side to headband doesn't work at all. Probably a manufacturer defect. It still works just by tightening the strap but definitely an annoyance. Tempted to try and exchange it but I really don't want to be without this for that long.If you've never tried VR. 400$/500$ is nothing for this type of experiences. Take the plunge. It's fantastic.Edit: went to Best buy and got a second one for the wife. She absolutely loves it

I would love to give the Oculus Quest a really good review because there are some really awesome things about it.  Unfortunately when I have owned two Quests for less than a month and in both cases the controllers malfunctioned, then I have a hard time giving it a favorable rating.First Quest, the controller started vibrating uncontrollably and nothing seems to resolve the problem.  The Quest controller also before that seemed to have a lot of problems with tracking.  It lost the tracking a lot in the middle of games.  With the table tennis game, it causes you to lose four or five points almost every other game.  Now it's lost connection with the left controller altogether.  The games are entertaining even though they are very subpar.  I don't think honestly very much forethought was put into the design of the Quest especially saving games to the cloud like on XBOX ONE.  I can handle the graphics being not up to the standards of XBOX ONE, but not providing any avenue to have more available memory or access to a drive on Wi-Fi seems unacceptable.  I had a ticket in to get my controller problem addressed.  It was very disappointing considering that I was happy enough with the Oculus Go to move on to the Oculus Quest.The Second Quest, I returned my first Oculus Quest and opted to get a replacement one hoping that would resolve the controller issue assuming that I had received a defective controller.  Normally, what I have come to find out is that usually if a product you receive is faulty, then it isn't the proverbial lemon products because bad products are usually indictive of the entire batch of products.  They are normally just a product with a defective design.  In spite of my better judgement, I decided to give the Oculus Quest another chance with the second one.  Unfortunately, the second Oculus Quest worked alright for 19 days before the right controller stopped tracking.  I should returned the first one and not wasted anymore time with a defective product line, but unfortunately I wanted the Quest to be the next step in virtual reality, an upgrade and much more technically advanced offspring of the Oculus Go, that I ignored what I knew was most logical choice and purchased a second one anyway.After talking with Oculus Support twice for two broken controllers, the only option that they give me is a factory reset to fix both controller issues.  The problem here is that I lose any game saves that are not cloud based.  I bought a lot of games and only one of them is cloud based.  This for me is an unacceptable resolution to a controller being broken.  I have setup a return to Amazon for my second Quest now and will be returning and purchasing a PSVR2 instead.  I will have to see how the game refunds go to determine if I ever will consider buying another Oculus product in the future.  The quality of the Quest is very detrimental to considering them in the future but if I get a full refund then I would still consider an Oculus product in the future.They denied my request for a full refund on games based on a defective product.  I have responded letting them know that it is my right to return all software for a defective computer product according to federal law and the Federal Trade Commission.  I am waiting on their response but next step will be contact the FTC to get the problem resolved then possible my lawyer.

I am just blown away with what this system delivers. I have had the HTC VIVE, after spending thousands to build a state of the art gaming PC, $600 on the Vive, I loved it. I spent another $500 to make it wireless, but still tied to my PC, still only works in the area I setup with the sensors.  Then, I got this. Turn it on and using the controls define the boundary of the play area by painting a line on the ground, that’s it. It needs no PC, no cables, it is completely self contained.I have games on both systems, many reviewers claim the Quest is not quite as good in terms of tracking or resolution.  That couldn’t be further from the truth.  Not only is it identical, I haven’t had any of the tracking issues or crashing games I had on the Vive. Or issues finding the sensors, since there aren’t any.You can enable developer mode and increase the resolution, too. It eventually slows the thing down but let’s you see just what it’s capable of, and it’s amazing.  There’s plenty of instructions out there that show you how to play your Vive and Steam games on the Quest, as well as pairing a keyboard and mouse to it.Besides the incredible games and fun you’ll have, just using the standard tools. I have been using it on long flights. Playing a movie from my phone was okay before, but now with the goggles I am sitting in a full-sized movie theater looking at a full sized movie screen playing my movie, from my seat on the plane. The immersion really helps you forget you are cooped up on a plane for hours and hours.I bought a compact carry case, and now the VR experience is completely portable.Pros:Everything. Hands down the best VR experience available. Sitting gates, room scale games, movies, you name it.  It’s amazing, and you just can’t even imagine the experience until you try it.  I have used the HTC VIVE for years and I can’t stress how blown away I am by this device.Cons: battery life. I solved this with a 3rd party headstrap, let’s me attach a rechargeable pack I bough for the HTC Vive wireless upgrade. It works for about 4-5 hours of intense use without the pack, maybe more, but can go all day with the right pack. The controllers use AA. I found they could be swapped every week, one per controller. Why these aren’t rechargeable like the Vive, who knows. So I bought a 4-pack of rechargeable and never worry about it.The last con is personal preference, but I have heard it from others. The faceplate doesn’t cover completely letting light in, and leaving marks on your face. I do suggest investing in a nice padded replacement. But even without it, it’s still 5-star amazing.If you are in the fence, just buy it. I can tell you that you will NOT regret it. You might regret buying the 64GB option when you run out of space. But because this is not tied to a PC the games are much more compact and streamlined. An 8GB game on my Vive may be 1.2GB on the Quest, and I am telling you they are identical to me, I can not tell any difference.Opinion:I have heard people dislike the audio and get headphones. First, I love the audio, I can’t even tell where it comes from, but it sounds good, clear and 3D. However there is options if you don’t like it. Plug any headphone into the jack to use it. Or, enable developer mode and add software to pair AirPods and other BlueTooth headphones. That’s pretty slick, I have to admit the audio and bass with my AirPods is impressive, but most of the time I don’t bother using them, because the built in is really nice for most games. But, for beat saber and movies I will use the AirPods.If you found this review helpful please click helpful, below.

Single most important information you need to know.  Oculus is a SINGLE user device.  You can not set up multiple user accounts on same device.  Major flaw.For where they've taken the device, it is inconceivable there is no way to share.  Sure, someone else can put on the headset, but you must use their profile  play their games, at their saved locations.Should you decide to buy and additional unit, you then need to repurchase every game again. Let's see: family of 4, each having their own set - $2,000 (128gb).  Games:  cost Xs 4 - avg $100.This was a gift for my son, but I pretty sure it's going back.  SHS.....so close, such a bonehead mistake.

Well, to put it simply, it's kind of a let down.First before we talk about problems, the product itself was given so much hype that when I first tried it I was actually disappointed. To put it bluntly, it promised more than it can deliver.Next is the problems, and there are quite few. Let's start with the one thing they promised, tracking.  Contrary to the claim that the tracking is perfect except for the blind spots, it’s actually not.  In reality 20 to 30% of the time I had tracking issues, even though my hands were in front of me or by my side, specially when not moving.Then there is the black the screen issue, sometimes when I open an app the screen becomes black I’m nothing happens so I have to restart the app again.Also there is what some calls ""fog"" issue in the middle of the screen. But I actually feel that it is not really fog but rather the pixel are white or bright because of oculus logo.There are actually other issues like the guardian system isn't actually accurate and it keeps popping up even after turning it off, the distance of the ground keep changing, or how it's so hard to find and adjust the headset to the sweet-spot. But these issues you can work your way around them somehow.And last point has nothing to do with the headset itself but delivery. When I purchased the headset I was asked if I want to be delivered during holidays and of course I said yes, but then even though my arrived and was ready to be delivered, they told me ""Sorry, sir. We don't deliver on holidays"". Then why would you ask me if I want to be delivered on holidays if you're not working on holidays. Is this some kind of a joke? It was Ramadan, I was fasting and it was scorching hot, I had to go there pick it up my as they told me to, but of course not without all the drama.

I got the 128GB model of the Quest on May 23rd. I went through the setup process and the Quest started downloading an update. I was monitoring the progress in the companion app on my phone. When it said the update was complete, I went to check things out but the system would no longer work. The display would only stay on for a few seconds showing three dots. It seems something didn’t go correctly with the update. I tried a factory reset. The display worked fine again at the initial setup mode, but again would no longer work after the setup/update and restart.I contacted Oculus through their email only support. They told me on May 24 I would be emailed a shipping label in 1-3 business days to return my unit and would get a replacement about 10-12 business days after returning it. I never received the shipping label in my email. I tried updating the ticket on May 30, but it had been closed due to inactivity and a new ticket was created. I’ve only gotten cursory responses like “we are looking into your issue” on this new ticket. It’s now June 4 and no update has been made to the ticket in 34 hours. I’m giving up on this and going to return my Quest to Amazon for a refund.

Perfectly good system. Roomscale VR works well, and the device has just about every feature I could reasonably expect and did expect: Minus One.The device does not allow any use of ANY KIND in rooms that are unlit. Which means it is useless as an in-bed home-movie system. I was told to expect every piece of functionality I got from trying the Go, but such a critical aspect, of being able to lie down and watch a movie in bed next to a partner without disturbing them, is entirely lost.I purchased this to use portably while I traveled. As I often share rooms though, this won't seem to be the case.

This device works amazingly for what it does. Untethered, stand-alone VR with 6DOF sensorless tracking provides unprecedented freedom and immersion. Easy pickup and play with almost no setup and everything runs smoothly. It’s truly the VR headset for the masses.However the company behind it has an ironclad control on content. Developers with well known and well received VR games on PSVR and SteamVR have been denied of publishing their games on the store. No reason was ever given. They also have asked existing developers to *take features away* from their apps. The Virtual Desktop developer added a feature to stream SteamVR games directly to the Quest headset. It works reasonably well and has been well received by the community. However, Oculus has asked him to remove that feature. Again no reason was given but it’s mostly likely such feature presents a conflict of interest against their other products like the Rift S, and maybe their own future streaming solution. Whatever the reason was, such draconian approach is not healthy for a new platform like this. Coupled with the prelaunch “no cross buy” controversy, every decision this company has done strikes me as short-sighted, anti-consumer, and pure money grab.For this reason, I can’t recommend this headset or their ecosystem at the moment.

I've played this thing for probably about 4 hours total now and I can't believe how great it is given the price.  Sure, you could buy a high-end PC for a ridiculous amount of money, then a headset, then you have to be tethered to the thing by a cable, etc. all for somewhat better graphics.  I have played a handful of games (Beat Saber, Super Hot, Job Simulator, Vader Immortal) and honestly the graphics look amazing.At this point even if someone gave me a PC VR setup, I'm not sure I'd consider it worth the trade to have to deal with cables, complexity, etc.  I previously had an Oculus GO, which was fun, but would leave me slightly nauseated after a while due to the lack of room-scale tracking.  This fixes that with the room tracking (6DOF).  The graphics are also noticeably better than the GO.I've heard complaints about the sound, but I think it sounds great.  I honestly think anyone complaining about this device is being very nit-picky and would probably also complain about a cure for cancer.  What Oculus has accomplished here is nothing short of amazing.  This is what I've always wanted VR to be and it's finally happened.The game selection is top-notch.  Every game I've played so far has been amazing.  I think they made the right choice by being more picky about what is allowed in the store this time around.  I feel like I could buy any of the available games and have confidence that I will enjoy it.Also, lest anyone think I just haven't tried PC VR, I have.  I've tried the Rift on a very high-end PC multiple times.  It was cool, but the cables were annoying.  With this thing, being able to just walk around the room freely changes the entire experience.If you're on the fence, I strongly encourage you to just buy it.  You can always return it, but I highly doubt you will.This has been one of my best tech purchases of the last 5 years.  5 stars isn't nearly enough.

One of the worst experience I've had in VR is with the Oculus Quest. Even with the Oculus GO I never had these issues. Everytime you put the headset on you have to reset the guardian. Other issues is that I was only able to see the Oculus home when I first turn on the headset after that if I leave a game and try to go to home I only get a black screen but still able to see the controllers. For me I don't want to have to start every game from the phone but unfortunately that was the only way it would work so I returned mine. Another thing is it's not really that much better in graphics than the Oculus Go, and the library is still very small. The last issue is that if your going to pay that much for mobile VR then you should not have to mode the headset with sideloading to play games from your GO or any other games that it's compatible to. They still have not updated VR Chat or RecRoom and a lot of other games.

The fun of VR for me is sharing what you're doing with the rest of the room. However, you're unable to cast some of the most popular games, including Beat Saber. Nowhere in game listings does it say which games you aren't able to cast, so you don't know before purchase, unless you research every game separately from the store (and even then it's difficult to figure out). It also just doesn't work consistently - doesn't work with certain phones, and sometimes just refuses to connect to Chromecast even though Chromecast is working with everything else.Additionally, you're using Chromecast, and there's no wired option to cast, so there's a delay in casting. In games like Superhot, this isn't a huge deal (though kind of annoying), however, even if they do fix Beat Saber, you'd be hearing the song twice, a couple seconds apart, and it would be very confusing. I read on forums they were working on a fix for Beat Saber. I emailed their support (I want to know the details, because I might return otherwise), and was told they don't have a timeline for the fix, and he didn't answer my other questions, such as asking for a list of games that don't work for casting.As for the rest of the headset, they've done a good job. Definitely a big step above the Go. I don't think it's particularly heavy - I find it comfortable (other than I can always see light coming from just above my nose). The battery life is okay - I never play for more than 45 minutes at a time anyways (but again, I might, if I was switching off with a group of people because the casting worked).AA batteries in the handhelds last about 10 hours of play.The game choices are somewhat limited, but it did just launch, so I suppose that's expected.

Ok, been waiting for this to be released for over a year.  Amazon got it delivered to me on the release day.  When I opened the shipping box last night I was amazed at the slick packaging.  Beautiful.  When you open the well made box and see that beautifully finished piece of tech it is even more impressive.  There is not much documentation on how to get started, so i plugged in the super long usb c cord, removed the cardboard insert over the lenses advising you to download the Oculus App and put them on .  The first display you see also tells you to download the app.  I already had it from my Go so I opened the app, hit pair new headset, chose oculus quest from the list of possibilities and entered the code being displayed on the screen of the headset.  At that point the headset walks you through the next steps of setup.  When the initial demo began I was very happy to see that the Oled screen lived up to my hopes.  The resolution is excellent compared to the go or the gear vr, the blacks are now actually black!!  The headset straps are more rigid and easier to get on your noggin.  I put the eyeglass spacer in right away even though I don't wear glasses.  It seems to hold the headset at a distance my eyes like better.  The controllers are fantastic.  They are well made, well thought out and beautiful to look at.  This whole system is beautifully made.  I spent a couple of hours last night experimenting with them in the basement.  One of the things it teaches you right away is how to set up a guard area.  This defines your playing space and alerts you when you are getting out of it.  It never once let me stray out and hit something.  Simply amazing for a self contained system.  One of the first things I found was that a lot of the apps you have for your Go aren't available on Quest.  Like Pigasus, Endspace, Gunjack, BlazeRush, Daedalus, Oculus Rooms, Eclipse and others.  I was a little disappointed by that.  It would be nice if the Quest could dumb down enough to play the Go titles I like so much.  Even the oculus video app behaves differently.  There doesn't seem to be any way to play your purchased Oculus store movies in this app and the theater environment is sadly gone.  I was really looking forward to being able to use that environment again with the true blacks offered by the Oled screen.  Now remember, this system is only a day old and all of this may be resolved in future updates.  Also, Bigscreen is available but crashed every time I tried to enter the lobby.  While a slight bummer, these issues don't take away from the fact that this is an awesome system.  I bought Vader Immortal and discovered that this headset will download far faster than the Go.  Vader is over 2 gb and downloaded in only a few minutes.  If the initial demo the headset ran you through amazed you like it did me, Vader will blow you away.  I wish I had a video of me thrashing around in the basement with a lightsaber only I could see.  If you want to calm down and just watch a movie or something, then right now the Oculus Gallery app or Skybox appear to be your best option.  Skybox works as great as it does on the Go but oddly seems like an earlier version, it isn't quite as fast as the Go version when listing content from a network.  The cool thing about the quest version of Skybox is you can actually walk around the initial ""lobby"" area.  You can also walk around in the theater, but if you turn around and look back towards the projection booth the seat backs are now transparent.  Not a problem, just a glitch that being able to move around has created.  The initial ""living room"" that you have as your home environment is beautiful and you can walk around that too.  If you choose something from the oculus gallery app, it will play on a screen in that environment.  The only thing I have found that I could really consider a glitch is once in a while you see little sparkles of light in certain circumstances.  Not sure if that was defects in a 360 video I was watching or what the cause was, didn't see it enough to be able to pin down exactly when or why it happens.The built in cooling fan makes a slight background noise that didn't bother me at all (I wasn't even using earbuds).  It does it's job too, after two + hours of hard use it never got warm.  The only problem I had with the headset was the center of my forehead began to hurt after those 2+ hours.  That might be solved by more tinkering with the straps.Is this worth buying?  Hell yes.  If vr trips your trigger like it does me, then it's a no brainer.  I got the 128gb version and would recommend it.  Everyone says ""oh, 64 is enough.""  I said that with the 32 gb Go and have always been pissed.  The apps for this headset are bigger and I would urge you to consider it.  I don't think you will ever wish you had less storage.Enjoy everyone and thank you Oculus, I don't think anyone else can stand up to this amazing piece of tech.Update 10/16/19  One thing that disappointed me when I got the quest was that the apps I really enjoyed on the Go didn't work on the Quest.  They have taken steps to fix this.  If you have purchased an app on the Go or Gear that has a version for quest, you can get a free upgrade to the Quest version.  I have gotten angry birds, endspace, starmap, gun glub vr, ultrawings and wander all downloaded on my Quest now and I am even happier with the system.  In addition, certain Go games can be played in their original form on the Quest now, such as Daedalus, which I am also happy about.  If you look in your library, you will see Quest up at the top with a drop down arrow.  If you click on that arrow, you can choose Go Apps that you have purchased and are playable on Quest.  This is all a big step forward.  You still cannot play movies on the Oculus Video app that you purchased from the store on Go or Gear, but hopefully that is coming.

Pros:The guardian system is cool and I DID NOT GET ANY MOTION SICKNESS with the 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF) that comes with this front-facing cameras guardian system.  However, it's probably related to programs that took advantage of the 6DOF.Vadar Immortal would best summarize as YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE THERE!  It's only episode 1 but it's just incredible!.All the games I tried were interesting and fun.  It's much bigger then what you see in the pictures.  The pictures just show the frontal view.  You feel the presence and the movie theater screen looks like iMax.  Network videos and pictures ran well.  3D videos also work.  Some of the games involve significant physical effort.Cons:The headset is front heavy.  You really feel the weight when watching videos but not so much when playing games.Facebook/Oculus should consider making an improved version of ""Oculus Quest Standard Facial Interface"" as an aftermarket optional accessory to help dissipate the weight of the headset especially at the areas underneath the eyes.  That'll drastically improve the user experience.Screen door effect is noticeable during video watching.Video quality is not that sharp especially in slow gaming environments when you start focusing on the details.Summary:Incredible technology with tremendous fun factor!  The feeling of presence and lack of motion sickness with programs that take advantage of the 6DOF are amazing!

Before reading, this review is coming from someone who uses a Valve Index.I wanted a simple low cost vr headset that was wireless, so I could watch movies/youtube in vr anywhere easily. I was going to get the Oculus GO, but then saw the oculus quest and learned it was wireless but also could tether to a pc to become a full desktop vr headset, which I found too good to be true. So I ordered the quest, and everything about this device is awesome. I can easily go wireless and watch a movie/youtube/etc anywhere in my/friends/family's house, and show it off to anyone. Then if I wanted to play a full desktop vr game, like ""Onward"" on steamvr, I can just hook up the link cable and bam, im now using the Quest as a full desktop vr headset, which is amazing.I did NOT buy the official Oculus Link Cable because its very expensive. So I tried researching to find an alternative that was cheaper. I ended buying the ""Anker USB C Charger, Powerline USB C to USB 3.0 Cable (6ft)"" which is $10.99 and a ""UGREEN USB Extension Cable USB 3.0 Extender Cord Type A Male to Female Data Transfer Lead (6ft)"" which is $6.79. I can confirm both of these cables work flawlessly. I played steamvr with the quest almost all day without any issues at all!Some 3rd party accessories I bought are:1.  ""VR Face Silicone Cover Mask & Face Pad for Oculus Quest Face Cushion Cover Sweatproof Lightproof"" $12.59 - which is a silicone face pad that just goes over the original face pad that comes with the quest. Its way better, in my opinion, than the original because its super easy to wipe down and it seems to be a more hygienic way of sharing the headset.2. ""Orzero VR Lens Protect Cover Dust Proof Cover for Oculus Quest"" $10.99 - This simply goes right over the lenses to protect them when the headset is not in use, or in a travel case/bag.3. ""SHBC Travel Carrying Case Compatible for Oculus Quest"" $27.99 - This case holds the headset/controllers/link cable/wall charger easily.4. Four rechargeable AA batteries - I have 2 always on charge, and 2 in the controllers.Very long review, I know......but this headset deserves it. I would 100000% recommend this product!

I was expecting a mobile VR experience with six degrees of freedom, but what Oculus delivered feels a lot more like a high-end VR experience than a mobile one. Many of the launch titles have squeezed so much out of the headset that you will find yourself completely forgetting that the entire experience is run on a Snapdragon 835 processor.The Quest truly delivers on its promises, and it has a solid lineup of launch titles that take full advantage of it.

The best and worst thing is not being tethered.  Without a PC, the graphics on most games are sub par. The question you have to answer is, is that worth being untethered?  If you never played on a PC with Rift, you will probably not be disappointed.  There are also a lot of crashing issues with Quest. Perhaps updates will correct that going forward.

This is my forth VR headset purchase. I purchased this headset mainly for workout type games like Beat Saber and Box VR. Being wireless is a big advantage for these types of titles and since they are not very graphic demanding they are a good match for the hardware.I was pleasantly surprised at graphic capabilities of the hardware. Titles like Robo Recall look almost identical to the PC version and play very smoothly. Vadar Immortal looks really good for a 'portable' title and really shows what the hardware is capable of.Unfortunately the sound quality is very underwhelming with the built in speakers. With my Bose QC headphones it is great. The sound is loud and clear and the 3D sound field is convincing. But with the built in speakers it sounds like everything is coming from a phone strapped to the headset. Definitely the worst out-of-the-box sound of the four headsets I've bought.Another huge issue with this headset is comfort. When you compare it to other headsets in your hand it doesn't feel much heavier. But when you put it on you sure feel it. This was a real big problem for me. I couldn't make this thing comfortable with any adjustment. Within minutes I would get sore spots on either side of my forehead and for some reason the muscles across the back of my head would get really tight. Something to do with the weight imbalance. No matter how I adjusted the strap I could never get it to support any of the headset weight. To me it just seemed like the strap was designed for a much larger head than mine. I ended up buying a Vive deluxe audio strap and a VR Cover replacement face pad. Between the two they greatly improve the comfort. I'll still never be able to run the battery down without taking a break but I can play for over an hour before I feel like I need to take it off. With the stock strap I was lucky to get 15 minutes before my face and head needed a rest. Also the VR Cover face pad is made from PU leather so it's easy to wipe dry. The stock face pad is a foam material and unfortunately sucks up sweat like the sponge it is. I highly recommend the deluxe audio strap as an upgrade as it greatly improves the comfort and the built in headphones address the awful sound from the stock speakers.As I mentioned I bought this mainly for workout titles like Beat Saber. Unfortunately I was a bit let down here. I don't consider myself a Beat Saber god and don't take it too seriously but I still like my equipment to keep up with me and not hold me back. But the Quest does hold me back. I generally play on the expert or expert+ level. Most of the songs I play I've full combo'ed long ago on the Rift. I've had the Quest for about two months now and play Beat Saber almost daily and I've yet to full combo even one song on expert. There are just too many tracking and glitching issues that will keep you from being able to complete a song perfectly. It's mainly tracking issues. Pretty much any song will have combos that are just too fast at the higher levels than the Quest can track. Lesser issues are when the screen goes black for a second or two when the headset looses the boundary. This happens in other title too but it seems more often in Beat Saber. And since the latest Beat Saber update it also suffers for a frame rate stuttering problem that didn't exist before the update. Add all that up and it pretty much amounts to never going to full combo on the Quest. And that's after completely changing your play style to accommodate the inside-out tracking which you absolutely have to do too. With all that said the tracking is actually pretty impressive and for everything but Beat Saber it's perfectly fine. But if you are the least bit competitive in Beat Saber you'll be disappointed when the equipment lets you down all the time.I still think this headset is the way to go for most people as this is the VR 'console' experience as opposed to the VR 'PC' experience and let's face it, most people are 'console' people who just want to pick it up and play. It also has some nice user friendly features. The ability to setup a play area in seconds is nice and the full 3D passthu cameras are awesome and should be standard on every headset made.At the moment the titles are somewhat limited but new ones are being released or ported all the time and there are plenty to keep you busy unless you've already played them all on another headset.I knocked off 1-1/2 starts for the huge comfort issue and another 1/2 star because they touted how Carmack was using Beat Saber to fine tune the tracking and yet it's still not reliable.I'd still recommend this for people just getting into VR but be prepared to spend another $100+ to make it comfortable. Still way cheaper than a VR capable PC.

I really like the unit, the controllers are great compared to the little Go controller and the 'guardian' system (to keep you from running into furniture and walls) is well done. You have to enable developer options to turn off the guardian system so you can use this lieing down or in the dark which is inconvenient.My main problem is I bought some content ($50-$100) for the Go and while Oculus/Facebook say the content will transfer (and list the title I bought, for example Wander and Ultrawings) this doesn't actually work. There is a page on the oculus website showing the titles that transfer and some people are getting their titles transferred but others are not. If it doesn't ""just work"" you're out of luck, Oculus/Facebook support says ""just keep checking back"" -- but the 'offer' expires at the end of the year so I'm guessing they're trying to get people to just give up and re-buy their content.Here is the page that describes the policy -- however the chat session I just had indicates this is not their actual policy -- games listed as 'eligible for upgrade' are not for at least my account.The Oculus support person said I could always return it, and after dealing with them for an hour I think I will. Next stop Amazon customer support. I'll buy it again once they have the store and software working like they describe on their own website.

I have been using the Odyssey+ for several months using Steam to play most of my game titles and playing Oculus games through it as well.  The nearly invisible screen door effect and the bright OLED display has been amazing and when Half-life: Alyx came out, it has played it beautifully.  I have a pretty middle of the road system:  Coffee Lake I-5 9400F (I don't overclock), and MSI Z-390 (on sale), 32 gb of DDR 4 memory, a RTX 2070 8 gb (old not super), and Windows 10 Home.I waited until it was restocked on Amazon and paid the regular retail price.  It’s already pricey without the price gouging.  I was expecting a downgrade in quality, with a Qualcomm 835 processor, 4 gigabytes of ram, and whatever the onboard video is.  While the texture and visual quality and was definitely scaled back, the wireless freedom with a room scale possibility of 25'x25’ was why I bought it in the first place.  It’s a tradeoff.  Out of the box, the setup was very easy with my cell phone via Bluetooth.  The guardian boundary is point-and-paint.  I love the pass-through camera to see the outside world with a simple double tap on the side of the visor.  The hand tracking was neat, but only a few titles support It fir now.  The Quest controllers are comfortable and responsive, but I need to tape the battery compartment shut with more intense gaming.  They only need 1 AA battery each, and the provided batteries are still at 50% after a week.  Many of the game titles I bought the full version from Oculus was available to download the Oculus Quest version.  So far, not problems with any of the programs.  I never found the reduced quality took away from the feeling of immersion.  The field of view is narrower than the Odyssey+, but being untethered more than made up for it.Now the best part-Oculus Link.  The included charging cable also allowed for me to access the Oculus Link beta mode to connect to my PC that can pump out considerably more pixels and high quality textures.  The charging cable is rated as a USB 2 and the Oculus test gave me at least 380 Mbits per second.  I played a couple of titles like Lone Echo and Blade and Sorcery.  They were more grainy and there was juddering and occasional stalls when changing scenes which broke the immersion.  So I bought a $20 10' USB C to A cable rated as USB 3.1.  Once connected, the Oculus program showed it was a USB 3 connection.  After a quick test, the bandwidth was at 2 Gigabits per second.  I hear the official Oculus Quest Link cable is significantly higher, but several reviews saw very little subjective difference in terms of playability and image quality.So the game I am focusing on was Lone Echo.  I just love that game with both a great narrative and a fully immersive VR experience.  The relationship between Jack (Echo I) and Liv is endearing.  It would stutter a lot on my Odyssey+ even when turning down the quality with a lot a jagged edges with AA on.  So I activated the link, opened LE and cranking the resolution to 1.8, all settings to high, and 4x anti-aliasing-there was no stutter!  There were also more texture details and I could read small text.  There is something to be said about playing a game on its native platform.  Far away objects were less distinct on the Quest, with more screen door effect. However the Odyssey is too clear and objects at a distance reveal all the jaggy lines, but also softer up close because of their anti-screen door solution.  Not that it was terrible, but the Oculus Quest Link provided a more immersive experience.  The one downgrade was with the 90hz refresh rate on the Odyssey vs the 72hz on the Quest.  Fast moving effects tended to streak a bit with the Quest, but not terribly so.  I did like the better tracking for Blade and Sorcery on the Quest to easily decapitate my foes.  I watched Netflix and Amazon Prime movies which are definitely nice to watch on a huge and acceptably pixelated virtual theater screen.  The OLED screens do not disappoint with vibrant colors and true blacks.  The OLED pentile matrix, as opposed to RGB panels, show some color banding and probably contribute to the SDE.The Quest is simply one of the most versatile headsets around.  It has some issues as a stand alone unit with scaled back graphics, a fairly short battery life (but charges quickly), and a narrower field of vision (possibly 90 with the Quest to the Odyssey's 110 degree).  With a slightly reduced refresh rate of 72 from  90hz standard, the Oculus Link majes up for it-that is if you have a more powerful computer.If you have yet to step into VR, you probably won't notice.  As far as comfort, it is front heavy with the face pad being a bit stiff and left me with maskface.  The head gear is hard to fit comfortably.  I added an additional velcro strap I got for $10 for the Odyssey+, I was able to redistribute the weight and I could play for two hours at a time.  I never got VR sickness on the quest, and I guess I’m the lucky few to never have experienced it.  This is a consideration for those new to VR.  Some will get VR nausea in the beginning no matter how high the refresh rate, but the there are features, like a comfort vignette when moving.  The 128 gb model is worth it for the future, as more and more games are being created, and then there’s side-loading.  It’s always good to have headroom should theIt is a remarkable product, considering it's using a mobile processor from 2017, with it getting considerably more functional through software updates.  Oculus has made quality VR a very accessible option for the average person, with advanced options for the more veteran VR user.My only real complaint is that some games are rather pricey and their store can become a money pit.  Oculus has a good refund policy, if requested within two weeks of purchase and it was used no more than two hours.  Other than that, I would purchase it before it is out of stock again and you’re left to the gougers.

I had really high hopes for this, as I am trying to develop games/apps for it. However, I have had such a horrible experience with Amazon getting one that I feel the stars also reflect me getting one from them.  First the get it in two days if you order within xxx times is a lie.  When I called to see where it was, they REordered it.. I didnt ask for that. Then the second order took over 2 weeks.  when it was supposed to arrive i got a notification on the day it was to be delivered that it was damaged in transit. Amazon DID NOT resend another one. instead I called in to see where it was.. they in turn basically said.. oopps we'll order you another one.. only that one was labeled a replacement.. I NEVER EVEN GOT THE FIRST ONE. this has caused me nothing but headaches.  I FINALLY got it. worked great for roughly 3 weeks then it started over heating and getting aritfacts and finally crashing after an hour and a half of playing. Not even a full battery cycle.  I had to limit my already limited playing time.  THEN the charger cable died.  just the cable. After calling in for a replacement, THAT WAS AN ORDEAL, they said my new one would arrive in Aug..ITS JUNE.. Im in the process of returning this. If I had to say whether the Oculus is good, all I can say is that while it is working it is fun. it still has bad screen door effect. the lag on some games is frustrating, however some games are really fun.  Mostly disappointed with Amazon right now. Hoping to get a GOOD working one...at some point.. when? Till then no more Oculus.

Purchased directly from Amazon, arrived on release day. setup was very easy and you do need android or apple device to complete the setup. Downloaded the Oculus app on my phone and followed directions. all purchases can be done through the phone app and automatically install on the device.  Most games average 200mb to 3Gigs per install.Having owned Rift previously I can say for certain that this was a much smoother experience to get going. Enjoyment level was also higher because of no cables to constantly remind you that you are attached to something.  Battery life seemed decent 3-5 hours on full charge depending on games played, charging time is pretty fast as well under 2 hours to full charge.  Nausea level was also significantly lower to non existent. This may vary per user of course.So far played Beat Saber and Sports Scramble both games a lot of fun. I think this a first product that VR has to offer that can truly be enjoyed by an average consumer.

This is a category defining product that “just works”. I was up and running with roomscale VR within 5 minutes. I was floored even from the tutorial... I’ve used other headsets in the past, and was skeptical that this could push the pixels it needed to be immersive, but I was so wrong... “Blown away” are the words that come to mind. Even drawing your Guardian boundaries was a cool experience. The tracking is also essentially flawless; is it as good as having 3 sensors all over your living room? No, but it is not just “good enough” it is excellent; you truly feel like you are fully in control in 3D space with essentially no input lag. This product will do what the iPhone did for smartphones. If you have been waiting to buy a VR product, now is the time to pull the trigger!

Let me first just say, this is an amazing one of a kind product. For those just getting into vr, wondering why you'd by something like this over a cheaper mobile headset, like a Go or Gear VR, the Quest is true 6dof (degrees of freedom) VR, unlike all other currently available mobile headsets which are only 3dof. In 3dof you essentially only have the ability to turn and tilt your head, looking around you. You can't lower your view by kneeling, or get closer to or further from an object using just your bodies natural movement. In 6dof your visual perspective is tracked in a 3D space, and is only limited by the room allowed in your physical environment. You can dodge and duck and lean and crawl all while spinning or walking around. Want to go prone in an fps, just lay down! People who haven't experienced 6dof VR are always blown away at the difference it makes and the possibilities it opens up. Then you have the tracked touch controllers, giving you amazing hand presence! Reaching out and grabbing and manipulating virtual objects is a game changer. Before the Quest, the only way to experience this level of immersion and fluidity was with a powerful PC and and a tethered VR HMD, usually requiring you to set up sensors around your playspace. While PC VR is still the only way to experience the most visually impressive VR titles, the Quest is shockingly capable and as a long time PC VR enthusiast I've realized the most immersive experience isn't always the most visually ""advanced"". I've barely used my PC VR (Rift CV1) since getting my Quest.Overall I think the build quality is pretty good. Not nearly as comfortable or solid as my Rift CV1, but not too far off. I did find it very front heavy, and even after lots of time adjusting it just right, it either hurt my face or the back of my skull after about 30 minutes. I fixed this by attaching a Vive deluxe audio strap, or DAS, and it's now much better, plus is finally has decent audio.Visually I love the quest. The screens are excellent with amazing blacks since they're oled, and I am not as bothered by the drop from 90hz to 72hz as I thought I'd be. I do notice it though, and super fast paced experiences like high level beat saber do feel a bit more hectic as it's not as smooth. But just barely. However the godrays that I'm used to seeing on gen1 vr like my Rift, and my old vive, are nearly gone on the Quest! It's a huge improvement, due to improved optics.Now, the tracking isn't perfect, though they vastly improved it on the Rift S with an update, so hopefully Quest will get the same update. With your hands close to the headset, like if you're aiming a rifle, or a bow, tracking breaks pretty quickly, but in general it's very impressive how well the 4 cameras track very fast movements with no problems. However there is an issue with the tracking during very vigorous controller movement, and it's been theorized by many, with a fair amount of testing to support, that under high velocity swings, the battery in the controller will compress the spring and move off the positive contact in the controller, creating a momentary power lapse, and the controller will freeze where it was, or if it was under high acceleration in a single direction may actually look like it's floating off. It only takes a second for the tracking to find the controller and it should reposition to its actual location as long as it has line of sight with the cameras. It does however lead to a lot of frustration in games like beat saber, and has ruined many almost perfect expert+ runs for me. Using a thick silicone tape on the back of the battery so that it can't slide up or down in the compartment has helped this significantly. This seems like it could have been, and some users have, fixed with a stiffer spring. But nothings perfect right.Well here's my main issue with the Quest, though it applies to the Rift S, since they use identical controllers. The new controllers are really fragile compared to the original rift touch controllers. Those old 1st gen controllers were built like tanks. My walls in my office are missing chunks where I got a bit too aggressive in Gorn. I once punched a 1 liter glass bottle of San peligrino mineral water across the room. During a lively session of Fallout 4 Vr where I didn't tighten the wrist strap, somehow I threw the controller, barely missing my monitor and hitting a wooden door. Other than having to dig out paint and and drywall from the seams on the controller, it basically looks new. And you know what, it's how all VR tracked controllers should be be built! But these new Quest/Rift s touch controllers are not built anywhere near the same standard. Side by side comparisons, and it's obvious they cut corners and material. Yes they're lighter, and compared to many consumer electronics, they seem fine, but for something you're meant to wave around at high speeds while essentially blindfolded, they're not sufficient. Many people have experienced breaks from waist height drops, or even lower in my case. Mine fell off my couch, less than 3 feet, and cracked the tracking ring. And they're $70 to replace each one. This is really disappointing, and I hope they address the build quality in future revisions because I want to feel good giving them all my money.So in conclusion, despite some seriously frustrating design decisions, I absolutely love it, and recommend the Quest. It's uniquely amazing, but mostly because Oculus currently has a monopoly on untethered mobile 6dof VR. Touch controllers were why I sold my Vive and kept my Rift CV1, and the beating those controllers have endured sold me on Oculus long term, so it's really disappointing to see these new controllers taking a real hit in build quality and durability.

This is by far the longest review I have ever written, however if you're on the fence or unsure of which VR to get, I hope you may find some answers or information in this writeup.I can't really compare these to recent VR models, but I have been gaming since the mid 80s, so I have a lot of experience with the evolution of video games, PCs, hardware, gaming peripherals, etc.  Since I have been gaming for most of my life, I am pretty selective about the games I play now, typically only groundbreaking newer stuff.  A lot of titles feel redundant and worn out.I remember VR in the early 90s, which was a terrible flop.  I could never justify buying one given the units were both expensive and low quality i.e. 263 × 230 LCD displays capable of 256 colors  for $1K....ouch, no thanks.When Facebook bought Oculus, many other companies followed their lead.  The first generations of these new VR headsets again were not really that great, but better than the 90s.  I got to try the first Oculus and I wasn't very impressed, assuming these would flop as bad as the VFX1 from the 90s.  There was also very little content, so I passed and waited.  As with mose tech, they would either flop and go away or get refined and polished.I stumbled across a Youtube video on the top 15 VR games of 2020 and quite a few titles caught my attention.  After spending about a week researching VR sets and options, I settled on the Oculus Quest.  This wasn't an easy decision, given there are a lot of options out there for VR headsets today.  I cross referenced the games I really wanted to play with each headset, and I was still unsure if the Quest would work with the Link cable to play some Steam games which would be very limiting for me. I mean after playing the first two Half Life games, it's pretty darn hard not to want to play Alyx.I took the gamble because I would send it straight back to Amazon if it fell even slightly short. I don't even own consoles, since I chose to put my money in good gaming PCs that I build myself.  I can say easily that the Quest did not disappoint.  Not having a tether nor external cameras is really nice, and I can live with a tether for something like Halflife because it's well worth the compromise.I should state that I do not have marathon gaming sessions on the quest.  I find short bursts to be enough, and I have not used it more than an hour.  That being said, that hour is pretty intense.  I do find it harder on my eyes than a good gaming monitor.  It's probably the distance to the screens combined with a lower refresh rate. For reference my main gaming monitor has a 144 hertz refresh rate while the Quest is at 72 hertz.The virtual desktop app is really neat (you have to buy that one).  While it takes a few extra steps to get Steam VR up and running it is worth it.  I don't see myself using it for PC gaming, it's just not as clear and seems to have a slight lag.  You can see all of your PC monitors in there, but text can be a bit hard to read (I'm at that age where my eyesight is going, it comes with having gaming experience in the 80s)  I'm not sure how many more games will be released in the future, but I feel there is enough to keep me occupied for quite a while.Onto my complaints.1) It's not overly comfortable, which is another reason I only do shorter durations.  It kind of feels like wearing a tight helmet, but tight just around your eyes, vs your whole face.  Time will make these units smaller, lighter and less noticeable.2) It's hard to get the view just right. As with most optics there are two factors that have a huge effect: eye relief and angle.  Basically where your eye needs to be for the clearest image through a lens.  Not only where it needs to be, but how much it can deviate from this location without losing clarity.  With the Quest it's ""not much"" which makes it hard to get the image perfect, especially when changing between multiple people.3)  There is no option at the moment for different user profiles.  This is flat out lame today.  This is setup to push the idea that your family members need to have their own Quest.  Maybe that would be an option if they dropped the price.  At a minimum the games should have the ability for different save files (some do), users, or player progress.  This is mainly and issue where this is a campaign mode (like Beat Saber which is really fun).4) The OEM Link cable is $80, that's a bit high for a ""quality"" 3.0 USB.  You can use an aftermarket cable (which I am), but it took me a few to find one that didn't constantly disconnect from the PC, which was beyond annoying.5) Your 3.0 USBs or your USB-C may not work with the Link cable.  My high end Asus ROGmotherboard has 4x 3.0 USB and even a USB-C port.  However at least one of the 3.0 USBs didn't work (called a weak port), and the drivers for the USB-C are ""incompatible"" with the Quest.  Baffling to me, not what I expected from a top line gaming motherboard (it's a bit dated, but not much has changed as far as gaming tech).  Some sources claim extra USB devices can ""weaken"" USB ports, and I have an 850W power supply? Go figure.Even with my complaints the verdict is a win and worth it.  It's really well done, the internal cameras, guardian boundary, and tracking is just amazing.  You are using a device that is essentially a wireless gaming platform with wifi, bluetooth, monitors, sound and cameras (calculating your position and movement) all attached to your head and all working flawlessly to provide an unreal VR experience.  Even the controllers are really well done, both in their setup and how they look and work in VR.  I look forward to where this tech is going in the future and I'm hopeful for more quality games, which is still a bit limited.  Hopefully with the success and popularity of Half Life, more will come soon.

I can say I'm very satisfied with the Oculus Quest. This is a game changer for VR. I remember when Oculus first appeared the cost of entry was pretty high ($1500 computer + $600 VR headset). Now you can have a great mobile VR headset for a fraction of the price. Yes this is still a pretty expensive gadget (at $399) but the barriers for entry for high quality VR has never been lower. Sure PSVR is cheaper but you still need a PS4 to run the whole thing. Oculus Quest is pretty much a stand alone device once the initial setup is done (yes you need a smartphone for the initial setup but once it is done you don't need your smartphone anymore as everything is self contained even the VR app store). This is the perfect device to introduce your friends and family to VR. This device is almost perfect but it does have some flaws: the number flaw is the power drain. Fully charged it will last you about 2-3 hours but in practice the device will be drained in about 2.5 hours, even if you connect it to a 20,000 mAH power bank it drains power faster than it charges so at most it will last you about 3.5 hours before you have to stop to recharge (anyway you should probably be taking a break by that time -- using VR excessively can be disorienting and exhausting). Also it gets a bit warm if you are charging it while actively using it. Yes there is light leak at the bottom edge of the headset (near the nose). I think it is intended but if that bothers you, there are a third party solution (third party face attachment) that fully blocks out light at the bottom edge of the headset (near the nose). I would say Oculus almost got it perfect and I think the next iteration of the the device will solve many problems.

To be transparent, I have owned an Oculus Rift and have a pretty quick Razr gaming laptop (not particularly new but it does the job).  The one thing I hated about the Rift set up was the wires and all the sensors that needed to be plugged into my limited USB port computer.None of that mess with the Quest.How they managed to squeeze out the graphics they did from the snapdragon processor is baffling.This thing is just as good as my Rift graphically, but i can go anywhere with it.I'll let that sink in, this $399 (I have the $499 128GB version) mobile VR Headset is just as good as a $399 Rift with a 2k gaming laptop.On to the specifics:Build Quality 5/5This thing feels solid, and the materials make it feel like a premium piece of tech.  The soft fabric of the actual device and the straps that hold it to your face are all well made and comfortable to use.Graphics 4.5/5As I said above I am very confused as to how they got this to look so great!  I took a half star because of small amount of screendoor effect (where you can see the pixels) but that is not as bad as the aforementioned Rift.Sound 4/5The device comes with audio that is piped down the straps into your ears.  It is open and just a tab tinny.  It does not come with headphones (though it does have 3.5mm sockets for your own) but I think they could have thrown in a cheap pair so it loses a star for that.  Overall the sound is good considering it is not via a headphone.  Also anyone near you can also hear what you are hearing.Tracking/Processing 4.5/5I bundled these together, the Quest uses inside out tracking which means it has to see the controllers with the cameras on the headset.  It does sometimes lose tracking in low light, which I believe is a known thing, just turn up your lights in the room and it is fine.  Surprisingly good at guessing where your hands are if it loses them (behind your head  for example when serving in Sports Scramble).Software 5/5I'm going to start by saying I have only a few titles but the launch line up is pretty solid.  Sports Scramble was surprisingly fun (until I punched a light serving lol), Robo Recall looks very similar to the Rift version and is equally as fun, I also bought Vader Immortal but have not had a chance to play it yet.  Netflix works great, it had a bunch of other apps but I did not try them all.  A surprisingly fun title was the First Steps tutorial, most tutorials are pretty dull, but this one was actually engaging!Overall I really liked the Quest, the freedom of no wires along with spot on tracking (in good light) and the ability to go anywhere with it make this a great VR Headset.  The fact you can also Cast what you are seeing to a Roku (which I don't have so didn't try) or a Phone is pretty awesome and stops your VR sessions being a very lonely event!One other thing I forgot to mention is that you do need the Oculus App on your phone to make the Quest work, not a problem for me but worth mentioning.I will update more as I get more hands on time.  But right now it is a pretty sweet device!

Finally a Virtual Reality Headset you MUST get: the Oculus Quest. And yes it is a game changer.The best thing about this Oculus Quest VR headset is the combination of great capabilities (close to the HTC Vive) BUT with full portability. This is a winning combo for me and probably most people.The oculus Quest can be played sitting down, standing still or moving around. You decide.The Quest feels and looks a little like the Vive but unlike the Vive you wont need a computer, or cords, or the location “antenna cubes”. And yet you have full freedom of movement 360 degrees. You define your own boundaries easily and real-time by “drawing” a line around you.I’m sure there will be many technical comparisons to other headsets but the Quest has enough degrees of freedom to make up for any potential performance differences. For starter the Vive requires a near desktop hefty computer and perimeter defining hardware.The Quest is totally self contained.Everything about the Quest is impressive.From the box it comes packed in (second only to the official optional Oculus travel case) in terms of safety holding all the components in and reusable.I like The controllers much more than the Vive’s. To Vive users, It may not seem so looking at them for the first time but They feel so natural and intuitive once you are inside VR. They are similar but more compact that other oculus controllers. Make sure you use the straps in the beginning or you may accidentally drop a controller when “dropping” a VR object.The first thing you should do after charging it is do the tutorials. They will blow your mind.Your hands will look and feel real. The Oculus Tutorials are really cool and when you play the 4 demo games included you will really have enough to keep you amused for a while before buying any apps. The demos will have you dancing alone or with a robot, boxing a professional boxer, using light sabers to the beat of music, shooting one handgun or two simultaneously and even a long gun weapon (rifle like), etc.Bottom line whether you have never used a VR headset before or you are an experienced user of what until now was a very good offering (the HTC Vive) you will find this a very satisfying experience.The number of titles available include free apps like YouTube Viewer, Netflix etc but also inter operative ones, like VRchat (a virtual meeting room), etc.The paid apps include arcade, racing, role playing, fitness, calming/relax , martial arts, , horror, action, spy thrillers , space games , travel, (including an Apollo 11 recreation), action, brain games and even multiplayer games. Both locally and not.There are two Quest models the 64Gb and the 128Gb. If you can afford another $100 go for the 128gb model. It’ll hold more apps at once.Current prices are $399 for the 64Gb and $499 for the 128Gb.This isn’t the first VR headset and it won’t be the last VR headset ever but this is definitely a game changer.O yes in case you don’t know Oculus is owned by Facebook. So it does offer extra features if you tie it to your Facebook account but you won’t need to do so. I haven’t and probably won’t in the near future. Although one of the features (VR events like concerts) may change my mind one day but right now I’m doing fine without connecting it to FB.

We got this with some research, however you never really know what it will be like until you use it. It is fun. I mean, a LOT of fun. The touch controllers are pretty intuitive. Even me (who doesn't play a lot of games) can do it without a ton of instructions from my kids. My son plays a ton of games and he is even better at it. We did see that a lot of people are having technical issues with it, such as battery charging issues. Ours is a little finicky to get to charge when the battery is really low, but it does charge. We only had that problem once, so maybe it was because the batteries were at zero.Overall, it is indeed awesome, but it almost feels like the whole system itself isn't quite finished. The headset is great (if you don't have any difficulties), but there are difficulties. It is hard to share screen shots and videos with friends or the casting to tv. We play this as a family most times, not alone, so we need it to cast. I mean, what are the other people going to do while one person is wearing the headset. We only have one headset, so we haven't tried interacting with them...yet! Our favorite games so far are Job Simulator, Beat Saber, VR Chat and Moss. We have only had it a few days now and I am sure as the platform expands and we explore more, we will find other favorites.For casting, we did get it to work by sort of tricking it. We cast from the quest to our phone, then on the phone, we cancelled the cast, but requested cast on the tv. That seemed to work. There were occasional stutters or freezes, but it was minimal.  We have both a televition with ChromeCast built in and a dongle. The casting would not work at all with the built in ChromeCast, but did (with the phone method) using the little ChromeCast dongle thing. The VR itself is amazing including the touch controllers. The overall experience of playing VR games is great and it i very fluid and comfortable. You actually believe you are in the VR world, but the overall user experience is still a little rough around the edges. However, it shoudn't be an issue within a few months with updates.  It isn't cheap. My kids pooled their money from birthdays and graduation to help get it and I was hoping they didn't make a mistake. So far I think they made a great choice!

First off I love this device. It's literally all I've been playing since I got it.Now there are some major cons here so I'll start with that.Cons:*Very, very uncomfortable, I bought two aftermarket items to try and make it less so. Total cost was $80 for the two. Spending $80 on top of the cost to make it bearable to use seems ridiculous to me.*The controls are too small and the wrist straps provide little security. These don't even latch in place. Very poor design, how much would latching plastic piece add to the price of manufacturing? Not much... Also, having to put AA batteries in feels archaic. Haven't had to to this since the Xbox 360...*Tracking get lost often which for a game like Beat Saber is the kiss of death to the full combo we're all shooting for.*Streams only to Facebook live.... I get it, it's a Facebook product, who streams gaming to Facebook live? It's all YouTube or Twitch major minute here.*128 gb storage.... For the high end version. Ridiculously small going to fill that up before I know it and then what? No SD slots no easy way to store games on a USB stick.Pros:*It's awesome!!!!*it's totally portable and you can play vr anywhere. Imagine trying to take your ps4 or pc powered vr to a friends to show them vr.*When the controls aren't losing tracking they are very accurate.All in all I'd recommend it if you enjoy vr gaming. Just know the cons going in.

This thing is amazing! You need to create a boundary system pretty much every time. But it takes only seconds. As opposed to previously, where you had to go into the settings, and walk around the room with the controller. Robo Recall supports cross buy. I would recommend it if you don't have it. It runs extremely smooth. I tested shooting behind my back and out of my field of view. It picked up everything. The library is weak as of today. But that's just because they're trying to sell you old games at full price. Job simulator? $30 really? Where's my vacation simulator!? Games are expensive on here. But it's not like the Oculus Go. It's more like the PSVR running on a regular PS4. I own every headset that's ever come out. Even the virtual Boy. This thing is definitely worth it. I dropped it 1 star because of the overpriced library, even for people that have owned these games for 2+years. Once the library picks up It will be amazing.Update: I used my Bionik headphones that I had for my PSVR on it. See pic. They're a tight fit, but work great. And they're super comfy.Update: If you are in the fence I recommend waiting if you can. It's been over a month and there is NOTHING in the store. I play beat saber mostly now because it's getting boring. No new games, no announcements. I know they're just trying to hold out so people will re buy 3 year old games at full price. Once the library picks up however, I may get rid of my rift

I've had the Oculus Quest since just after Christmas, so nearly 7 months. Before that my only experience with VR had been with my Oculus Go I bought last summer around the time of the release of the Quest.As VR viewing headsets becaming more popular, even the ones that use your smartphone, I started getting curious because I've dreamed of having a good personal movie theater since I was a kid and watching 3D movies with glasses has always bugged me. Plus, being one of the few kids to own a Virtual Boy left me wanting that potential to play out. So during Prime Day I got the Oculus Go 64GB for $90 off and was absolutdly blown away buy its performance as sn entertainment platform and I still use it for just watching 3D films. But I got more and more interested in VR gaming.I didn't have the money to build a new PC that was VR ready, my current machine has an under powered GPU, which can be upgraded, but also a CPU that is just barely below the listed basic minimum which would require a full rebuild, and I'd already be using Christmas gift cards and some extra money for whatever headset I bought. Having the Go I had many ads being shown for the Quest, and was extremely interested in it. I had no idea if I'd really enjoy VR gaming and felt like easing in was the better option anyway. So that made the Quest the one and only option!Once getting it I was hooked and I believe many others will be too. It has higher resolution than the Rift S, and the same as Valve's premium Index headset, but with lower framerate which so far isn't a problem for me. 72FPS is pretty good, it turns out. It is definitely front heavy and I recommend Rebuff Reality's VR Power battery pack since it is the only battery pack designed specifically for the Quest, and it is the BEST counter weight I've found. And padded headstraps and facepadding helps tremendously.After playing manying native Quest games I've decided to try Shadow PC service to get into using the headset for PCVR using Virtual Desktop. Shadow is backed up in getting their service started for new customers but I've already used Steam's summer sale to get some great titles at reduced prices, like Half-Life: Alyx, and I setup VD on my home rig, and it actually works already with HL:A, and as slow as my machine is, it is still an amazing experience and the Quest works flawlessly.It has the cons of being front heavy but that's the price of it not being dependent on a PC. It also has lower frame rate than just about any other current headset, but it has better resolution than many, and is TOTALLY WIRELESS.If you are a casual gamer, or want to try VR so you really know what it's like, or you want the Oculus library available (which is only available if you have a Rift of Quest) or you like the idea of full 360 VR all the time no matter what, get the Quest! If you take your time, join the Quest forums and learn how to make it work your way, you won't be sorry!

It’s a great system. Within a week of buying it I had bought about a dozen games and would gladly buy more over time. Having beat saber and box vr (now fit xr) means you can play and exercise at the same time. Which is really cool! I was losing an average 1 Lb per day playing those games for 30-40 minutes.However, system broke after three weeks of use. Tracking cameras got more and more spotty and the system wouldn’t let me set up a guardian. If you go online this is a recurring problem for some people. Tried getting customer service involved and they had me try stock things to fix it, which I did, and when I then asked for a replacement because it wasn’t working with those fixes they were giving me the runaround so that I would have lost my opportunity to replace the unit via Amazon. I ended up getting a replacement via Amazon (you guys rock!) and only after I did that did they contact me and offer to replace it... too little too late.My advice? Use it a lot the first two weeks. That way if you run into any problems you can return it and get it replaced. Waiting for my new unit and will see if any problems with that one. If it works flawlessly I’d probably upgrade the review to four stars.Customer service is important guys!

Got the Quest on release day. The lack of wires is great! We also have the PSVR.It’s super easy to calibrate. I like how you trace / draw in your floor space while in the device. We play in an open area of our living room / entryway and drew in the walls & couches.  It starts to show you mesh walls as you reach the edges of the safe zone. Height adjustment was super simple as well, touch a controller to the ground. The freedom to walk around with no cords to trip over is just incredible. I feel like I’m in the prelude to “Ready Player One.”It’s super quick to load into a game. When you take off the headset, it suspends. Put the head set back on, and you’re good to go. It saves the floor layout so we don’t have to recalibrate.One serious flaw for me was the way the Quest sat on my face. I felt like it pulled my lower eyelids down, and I couldn’t get used to it. My husband wasn’t bothered as much. He found a website that sells straps that go over the top of your head as an extra support for $27 including shipping from NZ, and now it’s comfortable enough for me to use.Playing Beat Saber on the Quest has pro / cons to PSVR. PSVR has controllers that are the right shape for light sabers. The Quest controllers’ battery compartment door pops off easily with the rapid motions for beat saber. We fixed that with a piece of packing tape on each battery door.  PSVR controllers don’t track well if you have light sources behind you, and the Quest doesn’t track well if you do large movements that go behind you or too low. I get a better work out with the PSVR since I can make larger movements. However, my husband has found a way to load a bunch of fan made songs into the Quest version so there’s more music variety. It’s also hard to beat the freedom of movement and speed of starting up the Quest.I can’t comment to the other games because I haven’t tried them much. I played the Star Wars game for about 10 minutes, and it was extremely immersive. He raves about the games constantly and is always flipping through the store.My husband has also found a way to use the Quest to stream from his computer. He can play VR games that are not available in the store, probably because the Quest doesn’t have enough processing power. His computer is running them so you can watch what he’s doing from his computer. There is a small lag, but he’s having a blast.I’m considering buying a second set for myself since this was his birthday present.

Let’s be clear; VR is awesome. If you’ve never put on a high quality or any headset like this before it’s going to be a shock to your system. Once you start gaming on this thing you start noticing all these little things that make it wholly unique from any other experience, gaming or otherwise. The controllers are good once you buy proper grips for them and the battery life is about 3 hours on a full charge which is plenty of time to get active and sweaty, which you will. The fitness and athletic applications for this thing are huge ever growing. It can be a little heavy and awkward on the head when you’re trying to move and lean quickly a la Beat Saber or Pistol Whip but I expect the designs to become ever smaller and lighter after this one.Now the crux of the issue. A Facebook account is mandatory to operate this thing or it’s successor the Quest 2. That’s a complete deal breaker for me. The only reason I didn’t immediately return this Quest was because I was grandfathered in to Facebooks insatiable lust for private data but as of Jan 1, 2022 this device and everything I’ve loaded on to it becomes a brick for me and I’ll have to sell it or throw it away if I refuse to create a Facebook profile. I despise Facebook and do my best to minimize support of all their platforms and products so for me all future Oculus products and programs are permanently scarred by being tied to them. I’ll never buy another. Do the smart thing and wait for the Valve Index 2.

As a long time follower and fan of VR the Oculus Quest is now here to spread VR goodness to everyone regardless of how much computer power they have around the house. Being wireless, easy to set up and totally portable makes a huge difference in how you play and relate to virtual worlds. I find the image quality to be excellent and use it to watch Netflix and my own collection 3D movies in perfect comfort without bothering anyone around me. Being able to play in the large area of my garage makes all the difference in feeling like you are in an almost unrestricted virtual world.The selection of games and experiences are also first rate and experiencing  ILMxLAB's Vader Immortal is worth the price of the headset alone and shows what the future of interactive entertainment has in store for us. Another favorite experience is creating artwork with Google Tiltbrush as being untethered makes a lot of difference in working on your artistic creations. Although the graphics on the Quest are not as detailed and refined as you can get with a high end computer with a beefy graphics card you will soon forget this when involved in an exciting game experience. I have also been using this terrific headset to enjoy and share 360 videos and 180 3D videos and pictures taken with a Vuze XR camera. This is the perfect platform for enjoying these new VR type cameras like the Vuze XR and Insta 360 EVO. Truly amazing.So the bottom line if you have any interest in trying out the VR experience now is the time to jump in with this great  new product from Oculus. The price is right and the software is here with more on the way. It will change the way you play video games as I find it hard to go back to a 2D monitor and mouse after BEING in the game using both hands and 6 degrees of freedom. And who wants to just look at a picture you've taken in an album when you can re-experience the setting of your photo just as you remembered it. I highly recommend this product.

Fun entry level intro to VR, however it will be outclassed faster in the VR world than the most gamers experience with PCs when the latest games come out. I would have to rebuild my PC just to play Alex on the Quest which is only doable with a tether. The more serious offerings are on VR headsets that are still tethered to a computer at this time. The 3D modeling and art programs I'd love to use are out of the Quest's reach because it lacks stand-alone compute power. For gamers this is also a limitation compared to the tethered headsets that are mostly displays for a powerful external CPU/GPU combination. Many games will come out that will have to be watered down for or not available for the Quest. The Quest recently introduced the ability to track your hand movement which is cool but not many apps can use it at this time. It works pretty well but a little clunky and has some response issues. The best feature is not being tethered. I should have spent my money on a PC upgrade and waited or looked into a tethered headset. The Quest is nice, I like it and use it. For most people it would be a wonderful and fun headset. For the power user and hardcore I'd wait for the next iteration with more power or consider a tethered headset.

I got this for Christmas and I used it for the first time today.  WOW!  It’s so unbelievably cool!!  I am 57 yrs young.  I had never tried VR.  But I had been hearing such wonderful things about the Quest.  So, I asked my family members to get me a gift certificate to Amazon so I could get this.  You are never too old to try new stuff!!  I was so impressed by just everything about it.  It takes a bit of practice/getting use to re the buttons on the controllers.  But, once you master that, I think you’re good to go!!  Like many people, I’ve gone through some things - lost loved ones, etc - in the last few years.  I bring this up because when you are playing this, you forget about everything.  You are in the moment.  After my sister died in 2007, I use to go to the movies once every few weeks; when you are inside the movie theatre and it’s loud and the screen is huge, you are forced to be “in the moment”.  So I liked that.  (Of course, it beats other alternatives like hanging out at bars all the time, etc lol!).  So, besides all the great things this quest has to offer, it’s a healthy way to tune out the rest of the world for a few hours.  And I think we could all use that!  I will probably buy the dance app and beat saber.  Bc oculus is having a sale right now.  I hope, in the future, that the price of games and such goes down a bit.  Though, I imagine, as it gets more popular, they will go up.  Set-up was easy.  And it charged in less than 2 hours the first time.  I believe it has the same adapter as my samsung 8+ phone.  Which is another bonus.  Will get the amazon case for it so I can take it to friends’ houses.  It’s important to protect the headset and the controllers.  Am considering purchasing an extra warranty on it but not sure.  If anyone has any suggestions, let me know please.  I don’t care what age you are.  Just buy it and have fun!!  It’s incredible!!

The controllers were randomly jumping around and I tried everything to fix.  Oculus support gave me several hours of run around made ridiculous suggestions like turn it off 3 times and wait until the battery is charged to 100% before it will update.  Clearly they had no technical skills.  And after 15 minutes, they should have just replaced the Quest since it was brand new, but they wouldn't.  I can tolerate receiving a defective product because it happens, but any good company would simply replace it immediately.Thanks to Amazon, I was able to exchange it for a new one with no hassle, since it was Amazon selling it.  This is the second time now I bought a brand new Oculus that didn’t work.  I had problems with my brand new Oculus Rift as well and went through hours and hours of support.  Then they sent me dirty used controllers to replace my brand new ones and it took over a month.  Not a good customer experience at all.  I don’t know of any other time I’ve purchased something brand new and the company didn’t immediately replace it immediately if it was defective.  Wow.All that said and two weeks later, I love the Quest.  The new one took 15 minutes to set up.  Has no cord!!!  Turns on in a snap.  Downloads much faster.  It is a little heavier as some have said, but well worth the trade off.  You kind of want it to rest on your cheek bones to take some weight.

I'm all in on VR.  I pre-ordered a Rift & a Vive.  I own a Oculus Go, PSVR, Odyssey, & Odyssey + as well as every Gear VR & Daydream View that's been released.  The Quest is what mainstream VR looks like.  The freedom that wireless brings and the difference in the experience can't be overstated.  I won't be buying another PCVR headset until wireless is built-in.Make no mistake, this is a mobile device, however the comments about ""PS2"" graphics and such are idiotic.  It's not difficult to find side-by-side comparison photos/videos versus the PCVR equivalents and while there are obviously differences it's remarkable what developers are doing with this hardware.  For most games the difference is hardly noticeable once you're actually playing  I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that because it's easy enough to find videos on Youtube.  The optics themselves are fine.  I hate Fresnel lenses but this is maybe the least annoying pair I've used so far.  The screens are great with deep blacks and vibrant colors.  There is more SDE than the Go but it's not bad at all IMO.  The image quality overall I would say is excellent.It's very comfortable for me.  Obviously this is going to vary depending on the shape of your face and head but I have no problems even for extended periods of time.  It is heavier than PCVR headsets of course, and a little heavier than the Go, but it is hardly noticeable.  The headband cradles the base of the skull in a way that keeps most of the pressure on my forehead instead of my cheeks so it doesn't bother me.  As a person with a massive head I'm very happy that it has the software IPD adjustment.  Fogging has been a non-issue but it does have a super-absorbent foam surround.  I really wish the headset manufacturers would starting including leather/rubber/whatever facial interfaces in the box that can be easily wiped off and cleaned of sweat.  It's especially important for something like this that you may be passing around.The sound is good but not great.  It sounds good but it's not quite loud enough.  It's plenty loud if your'e alone in a quiet room but if there are others around talking or if there is background noise it can be insufficient.  I'm happy to have the audio solution it does have though since it allows me to keep some awareness of my surroundings.  I just wish it got louder.  I can always plug in headphones if I want better sound.You can cast from the Quest to your phone and from your phone to a Chromecast.  This works fairly well though there is a delay.  This can get really distracting when you're in the headset because you're hearing the sound duplicated about a 1/2 second or so later.  Headphones could alleviate this.  It does seem to be a needlessly complicated procedure.  I don't get why Oculus places so much reliance on this stupid phone app.  You have to have it to activate the Quest just like you did with the Go.  This really seems like a stupid process and I hope they get rid of it sooner than later.  The app does make it nice and easy to manage my library and browse the store but it should be optional.  Unfortunately not all apps can be cast.  The biggest and most noticeable example is Beat Saber.  This is arguably the premier VR experience right now and the best way to show off the Quest.  Not having streaming available seems like an insane oversight to me.  The devs have stated that they are working on that so hopefully it will be available sooner rather than later.Tracking works very well.  I've played mostly Beat Saber but also Vader Immortal, I Expect You To Die, Journey of the Gods, the tutorial, and some Space Pirate Trainer.  The Odyssey+ is my favorite PCVR headset but the WMR tracking is not the best.  This is far, far better.  It's very noticeable in Space Pirate Trainer.  I would frequently lose tracking on my Odyssey & Odyssey + on my shield hand but no such issues with the Quest.  The only time I've noticed any issues at all is when it gets too close to the headset between the cameras.  I did see some video of a guy having issues throwing grenades in Onward but given I don't play Onward and I've thrown things with no problem in multiple other games with the Quest I expect this is something to do with the specific game.  One thing to be aware of -- the tracking requires light to work.  IT DOES NOT WORK IN A DARK ROOM.  Apparently it does work in the dark if you flood the room with IR light but I'm guessing most people won't just have IR light emitters lying around.The Quest has by far the easiest setup and best Guardian system I've seen.  Put the headset on.  If the floor isn't at the right height just touch the floor and you're good.  Now you get a cursor from your controller to draw a circle/square on the floor and you're set.  Takes like 15 seconds max.  This is how it should be.  MUCH better than walking around your room with a headset or controller, sitting your headset on the floor, etc.  You can easily switch between a Roomscale Guardian and Standing Only Guardian (small circle around you) with just a few button presses.  If you're really feeling lucky you can even go into developer options and disable it all-together.  It's also super cool how if you stick your head through the Guardian wall you get a 3D view from the cameras.  It's black and white and something is definitely off about it but it's still super cool.  It's kind of like the Vive pass-through but more useful.  Now if only you could activate it at will.  Also worth noting that the Guardian boundaries are a little more sensitive than I'd like.  I wish they didn't pop up until my hand/head was right on top of it.  They do appear more often than I'd like.Okay a bit long winded but I hope I didn't miss anything.  This is easily my favorite headset.  No need to mess around with Steam VR, no cables, just put it on and play.  This is the future of VR I think and I really understand now why Carmack has been so into mobile VR from the beginning.  While enthusiasts like myself, and probably a lot of you reading this review, will always be out there enjoying better graphics and cutting edge experiences that is not where the masses will play.  Just like your average gamer is on a mobile phone or a console and not a gaming PC.  That's what the Quest is; a VR console.  Everyone I've shown it to has been far more excited by this than they ever were for the PCVR headsets.  The launch lineup is great, even if individual games can be a bit pricey, so hopefully enough people get to try it and fall in love that it takes off.  That may or not happen with this version 1.0 of the Quest but I'm 100% convinced that this is the form-factor that will rule in the future.

This thing is awesome.  Having never used VR before, I don't have any prejudice regarding super high visual detail, but this thing looks fantastic to me!  And there are no wires to get in the way, no extra PC to buy and maintain, none of that.  I do wish we could download games to our phone and then to the headset via bluetooth though.  It downloads via Wi-Fi, and for those of us who are truly wireless that consumes bandwidth from our monthly hotspot allowance.  Oh well, not too big of a deal.  The largest games I've seen are about 3GB.Beyond the freebies that come with the device, I have tried Anne Frank house, Beat Saber, Moss, Apex Construct, and The Wizards.  Each of them is great in visual detail and immersion.  I'm hoping for a D&D / Skyrim type game with third person control, like Moss, and lots of puzzle solving.  I firmly believe that cordless VR is the future of gaming and probably design modelling and build instruction (think ""how to assemble a complex part"" being shown to technicians in VR, allowing them to manipulate and assemble/disassemble virtual products.  This would be especially useful in highly engineered low-volume product assembly, such as spacecraft and propulsion systems.)

Coming from a Microsoft mixed reality VR headset, I knew the graphics would be a notch below what I'd been accustomed to, but the total Quest package/platform, despite the drawbacks in hardware, VASTLY surpasses my overall experience with Steam VR and using my VR headset on a PC.By far the most important improvement I've seen is in the overall end user experience. On the PC side, I had to constantly deal with hiccups when switching between multiple VR apps, usually requiring a reboot after one or two sessions, not to mention being tethered to the PC.With the Quest, the closed ecosystem produces a smooth, mostly trouble free experience, even when quitting and loading VR apps, back to back. Best of all, the headset itself powers on very quickly.There are a few cons. Battery life isn't great. Usually a couple hours. You can play with the system charging, with of course, the downside of being tethered to the USB C charging cord. The speakers on the headset leave a lot to be desired, though it does have a 3.5mm audio port on both sides of the headset, giving more flexibility in your headphone setup.Bottom Line:I'm having a blast playing VR untethered with graphics that come surprisingly close to PC level, in a small package that you can take with you, that boots up quickly, with stability I wish I had on my PC VR's setup.

Smudge under right lens front element.  The experience is affected as this has been worsening day by day.  It seems to be growing, I’m not sure if it’s trapped moisture or an imperfection. Tried microfiber/lens cloths, everything.  It appears to be under the front element.

I had the money to buy an Index, Vive Cosmos, Rift S,  and many others.  The wait times did play a small part in my decision to rush, but not totally.  The Quest has fair-to high resolution, but what I would consider low FOV.This is my second Oculus product, and I am extremely pleased.  Sturdy, light, high expectations met.  The visual quality is a massive improvement over the Rift CV1.  I loved the CV1, but it was bleary and hard to see compared to this.  Colors are quite good and everything is crisp.  The refresh rate is not really an issue.I had two goals for VR:  must play my big VR games, DCS, Assetto Corsa, etc, but also be portable, and this meets both wonderfully.  Better than CV1 by miles, and good times in portable mode(without link).Cons:  Sideloading apps.  You can't ""sideload"" any old game.  It means android made apps, small homebrew games, and mods.  You CAN wifi your big games to it by a couple different means.. so yes they can be portable too.-Past game developers, I would love you if you made your games available on Quest.  Cat Sorter, Duck Season, etc.You will get more quality out of a hardwired VR setup and pay a lot more money, but I can tell you, this is wonderful.  Oculus has wonderful plug and play ability, flexibility, mod ability.  This thing wants to bluetooth to everything and improve your experience for it.It's almost a Rift S, but has portability.  Better than CV1 by a lot.  A good money saver over the top-end sets and really reaches on quality.  Very happy.

If you are looking to get into VR and don't have a PS4 or gaming computer, just buy this now. If you are looking to get into VR and have a PS4 or gaming computer, also just buy this.The Quest has no cords and the setup takes less than 20 minutes. New games are coming out every day and the immersive experience with this product is fantastic! While buying this product I highly recommend the following additional purchases, which I have found to greatly improve the product:1) Silicone facemask and grip covers2) 10,000 mah portable charging block3) A clip to hang the charging block from the back of the Oculus head-strapPlaying the game with the face mask improved immersion and comfort and the charging block on the back of the head helps to distribute the headsets weight away from the front while also increasing possible game-play time from 2-3 hours to 8-12 hours!

My Son convinced me to try the Oculus to get involved in several of the fitness programs/games.  I was very skeptical because I am VERY susceptible to motion sickness and did not want to spend that kind of money if it would make me ill after the first 5 minutes.  After about a month of use, I can say it was a very good purchase and I have used it without issue - if I follow certain guidelines.PROs:1. Quest is all in one and does not need to be hooked up to (tethered to) a PC.  There is no cord to get tangled, unless you don't want to use the internal battery.2.  The game/program store includes a 'comfort level' description of each game, so you can better gauge if it will be challenging for motion sick prone players.  I have chosed ""Comfortable"" level games and had no issue at all, and I am someone who gets ill playing any Xbox FPS game.3. The game play and immersive quality of the 360 virtual environment is amazing.  It is VERY easy to forget you are standing in your living room (more on that later).4.  The number of games/programs is fairly rich and appears to be growing as the number of Oculus users grow.5. Audio is from built in speakers in the headset and it is very good.  The player can hear everything they should from the program and others in the room hear very little.  Of note, the player can still hear the ambient noises of the REAL environment - which I feel is a pretty good safety function.  But you can use plug in ear buds/headphones if you choose or need to be totally contained.CONS:1. The headset is an all in one unit (display, CPU, Memory, etc).  That equates for a bit of heft to the headset.  I don't feel it at first but find that after an hour or two I start to feel the weight on my forehead/bridge of the nose.  It is a minor thing and now I know to expect it, but at first it was an adjustment to work through.2. The lenses are sensitive to 'exact' placement. If you don't have the headset positioned correctly, you have a reduced field of clarity.  There is an adjustment control to help match eye spacing and angle, but the 'sweet spot' is fairly small and takes a bit to find.  Those who wear glasses for near vision will need some time to perfect the view.3,  I find that the system will last about 2.5 to 3 hours on a charge.  And really that is quite long enough most sessions.  If you wanted to continue past that you can plug the headset back up to the charger (USB cable) and continue playing (with attention to ensuring the USB cable is out of the way).4.  Hand controller units run on a single AA battery (each).  I like the ease of replacing a ubiquitous AA, but for some games that you are 'holding' a tool (gun, sword, boxing glove, etc) then entire game, you are continuously using the controller battery.  I have about 15 hours of game play total and just replaced the AA batteries for the first time.  I plan to switch to rechargeable AA's to cut down on replacing batteries. Other comments:- Oculus has a great return policy.  If you purchase a digital game from their store and you find it does fit your expectations (bad gameplay, makes you sick, etc), they will refund the price -- As long as you do it within 14 days AND you have played the game less than 2 hours.- In my first week of playing, I got absorbed in the Virtual environment in a tennis game and actually tried to 'run' to hit a volley.  I crashed into a table and caused all kinds of damage (to the table and myself).  I hear that is part of the learning curve -- and I learned my lesson.  Just shows how immersive it really is.-Favorite games so far are Beat Saber, Fit XR and Gunclub VR.  Another fun one is Sports Scramble, but it is more kid-oriented.- Note about Motion Sickness -  In addition to games, you can also watch free Concerts/sports or action videos (hang gliding, acrobatic flying, surfing, virtual tours, etc).  I have found that most of the action videos are not comfortable for me, but I am testing to find what is.  If they move the camera quickly and/or wildly, I have to stop it and take a break.  Nearly all the games you can see a demo version either via the headset or online.  Many of the action games can have challenges for me, but the Comfort level indicator in the store is a good heads and has been accurate for me so far.-  I am a 59yr old slightly overweight male and if I can have fun with it, anyone can. I have played online games with my computer and stand alone boxes since my kids were kids and find I am increasingly more susceptible to motion sickness with both. I have found the game choices for the Oculus offer great fun and fitness options for me and I can play without getting headaches or motion sick.-  Bottom Line it is very fun with lots of variety and lots of options for all types of game genres

If you are like me, you've been watching the evolution of VR and waiting for something to come out that was worth buying and also not break your bank account.  THIS IS IT.  It's finally arrived.  The quest (I got the 128 version) is completely self contained (although you really need a smart phone or PC to get started, after that the phone and PC are not needed).  It's wireless and you don't need a computer to run it.You start out by pairing to your smart phone.  This took me about 10 minutes to pair and get everything set up on my home wi-fi etc.  You will need some wi-fi for updates and to down load your games.Once the initial setup is complete, you don the headset and pick up the hand controls.  Donning the head set is quick (you can pass from person to person easily) and it's mostly comfortable and lightweight.  You then see a black and white image of your room and play area (you may have difficulty playing outside as the sun confuses the sensors).  You ""paint"" your play area in the virtual world.  The Quest will keep track of your position and warn you when you get too close to the boundaries.  This is pretty cool because while in the virtual world, you can stick your head out of the  safe area and look around at your living room - it's like sticking your head through a magic portal - cool.  Your safe area remains memorized as long as you want, so you don't have to re-paint the safe area every time.Then you start playing and OOHHHH.  How cool is this?  No, the graphics and frame rate are not the absolute best, but they are sufficient for immersion.  Sound quality is OK.  You can also easily add your own ear buds if you need more bass.  Head tracking is dead on.  Hand tracking is 99% on.  It's true that when you move your hands behind your head, you lose tracking, but it doesn't happen often.  I've played Beat Saber, Space Pirate Trainer, Super Hot, Rec Room, and my favorite so far - Darth Vader Star Wars thingy.  If you let your imagination go just a teeny weeny bit, you really believe that you are there, on a space ship, watching Darth Vader stare down at you and wag his fist in your face.  Can I tell you I was intimidated?I can't play for more than 45 minutes or so or I get a little eye strain.  Battery appears to last 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Be prepared to spend another $100 or so on games; there is very little for free other than short demos.Also, many of the games actually make me sweat and I get slightly winded from the exercise.  It's about equivalent to power walking.  It's not a replacement for going to the gym, but it's a lot better than just sitting in chair twitching your thumbs.  Don't even try playing in ""seated mode"".  The beauty of this is that you can jump around your room and dodge bullets and swing light sabers etc. etc.This is going the be the Atari 2600, VHS, XBOX, DVD player of the future.  Congratulations to Oculus and Facebook for creating a real game changer here.

Immersion 9I had a fun VR experience from this headset.  It is remarkable that I get this level of immersion from a mobile headset.  Un-tethered freedom is quite exhilarating.  However all this freedom does come with a small price.  The graphics do take a hit compared to a PCVR.  Although it doesn't take away from the immersion and the exhilarating freedom it provides.  Just don't expect realistic PC graphics and you won't be dissapointed.Control 9Touch controllers are awesome to use.  There are some tracking issues where you lose tracking here and there especially on certain games like beat saber.  An update is supposedly coming to fix it.Comfort 7The Quest headset is a bit heavier than most headset as it is an all in one system and its is front heavy.  The original strap and face cushion is a bit comfortable for most and makes it harder to play for a longer duration.  However there are remedies that can be found in the reddit community /youtube.  There are mods eg. frankenquest, etc. even a halo mod thats similar to the Rift S has been floating around on reddit.Setup / Sharing(needs a phone for initial setup and casting)  Casting to the phone seems to be the best way to share your VR experience as theres no hiccups or delays however be aware that some phones like Huawei devices are not supported.  You can also cast to pc via scrpy or to tv via chromecast V3 or Ultra.  I think they have recently added V2.  But be aware that casting is still considered BETA by Oculus and is hard to get any support from them if your device is not yet on their official list of supported devices.Games/Content 7There are a few games that are great to start with but most of the games currently available in the library feels like minigames.  However, you can STREAM Steam VR games to your Oculus Quest via Virtual Desktop App (in Oculus Store for $20) or via Free sideloaded ALVR software.  But be informed that experience varies, latency and hiccups abound.  Need a good PC to run as well as 5GHZ wifi connection to stream properly.  I also use my headset to watch 3D movies and now tons of free content from BigScreen (free app on Oculus Store)

Great entry level headset to the VR world

During the Christmas Digital Monday I purchased the Oculus Go as an introduction to VR. It was extremely affordable and didn't need anything to get started. I instantly liked the experience but felt that a lot of the apps were lacking or not worth the time. The visuals were also not that great as it could only handle lower scale mobile games and the eye piece didn't have much resolution.Fast forward to the Oculus Quest...VR experience:As soon as I put this headset on it was a much better experience. In comparison to the Go, the quest has you setup a perimeter for your safe zone so that you can play safely even within a small space. I have a small 4x4 area in my garage that I like to play and the ""guardian"" system keeps me from punching the walls or knocking over objects. It even remembers old guardian locations that you setup throughout your house which saves me time when I want to play in different locations which happens often.Sound, Lens and App store quality:The sound quality feels about the same as the Oculus Go to which I'm not complaining as I think they both sound pretty good for tiny speakers, I feel that the Quest's audio is a little lower than the Go (could just be my headset) though. The visuals and overall app quality to me would be the main reason to pick a Quest over the Go. The Quest has a pretty big library to choose from with some great titles but I feel that their games/apps are a lot more expensive as most are around $39 for the Quest (avg $1 to $5 for the Go). The Go had issues where often times everything would look blurry and I would wonder if the lens was smudged. I would wipe the lenses clean and still have a blurry view. The Quest comes with a button that shifts the lenses from side to side to match other peoples eye distances which seemed to help clear up this blurry view for me (why isn't this on the Go?). My wife and I use this feature every time we exchange the quest.Comfort:The additional weight of the Quest compared to the Go means that it's pretty heavy on the front and the stock setup will likely give everyone a headache. The Go was extremely light so you could wear it for hours without any problems. The Quest however never really feels comfortable and I can only play for about 30 minutes tops before I have to remove it to give my head and face a break as it feels like it's trying to crush my skull. This can be alleviated with some 3rd party options like silicon face pads or cushioned straps but I've found it eventually still tries to crush your face and just extends the play time for me by about 15 minutes. (this is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3)Graphics:The Oculus Go's quality left a lot to be desired in most instances as it could only handle low poly and low rez models which are generally not the best for a VR experience. You only get one controller that feels more like a TV remote than a gaming remote so the experience isn't that amazing there. The Quest on the other hand has much better graphics in its applications and can stand a mid level range of graphics. Games like Vader Immortal look pretty great and are easy to get immersed into while playing. I was not disappointed with the graphics in any of the games I've played so far.The Controls:The Go's control (just one) wasn't anything special really, it felt like something you would give some one for a prototype or if you wanted them to know that there wasn't much they could expect to do. In comparison the Oculus Quest's controllers (2) look more like what you would expect for a VR experience. I found that while it looked weird, the placement of the buttons and analogs make sense once you're in the VR space although it still often feels weird to me. The Go had a more secure battery casing that would stay put as to where the Quest's battery casing is attached by magnets. I've had it come off a few times during game play so I ended up getting a controller strap thing which also helped keeping the controls in my hand while playing games like beat saber.Overall:I think that the Quest is a great experience and closer to what I imagine VR should be compared to the Go. I feel that for the price however, they could have made a more comfortable headset and I'm hoping that the next version is more lightweight for comfort purposes. The graphics are pretty amazing and while I haven't tried it with the PC link yet, I'm excited to give that a try soon.

I'm not one for superlative reviews (check my history) but honestly, this device is amazing.  It's obviously not as powerful as the Rift or the HTC Vive, but then again, those cost hundreds more for the goggles alone and require a powerful computer behind the goggles to get the full effect.Bottom line is that, for the price and the convenience of true cord-free operation, the Oculus Quest cannot be beat.The responsiveness of the controls is perfect.  No lag, and the control feels completely natural.  The built-in proximity cameras work flawlessly.  You draw your open space and it will put up a virtual mesh wall when you get too close so you won't trip over anything (if you've drawn the open area correctly, of course).The free apps that are available are excellent at showing off what the device can do.  Playing with a little strange dino-alien pet, playing catch with it, scratching its belly until its leg kicks is just wonderfully fun.Watching a movie on Netflix while increasing the size of the ""screen"" until it looks like you're in one of the front rows of a theater is a great way to watch a movie.  With earbuds in it becomes a completely private experience that won't bother anyone else around you.I find the goggles comfortable for long sessions.  It takes a little bit to get the tension just right on the straps, but once you do it's very easy to wear without discomfort.  The images are very clear and in-focus even for my less-than-perfect eyes.If you've been waiting for VR to become worth it, this is the time to jump in.  A great selection of paid apps with more coming, being able to watch incredible 360 videos from YouTube (check out Angel Falls... omg just awe-inspiring), and just having fun without a hassle makes this totally worth the price of admission to the world of VR!

Despite being shut down properly (I owned a Go for a while and am familiar with how these headsets work) every time I plugged it into the charger, it would turn itself back on.  It never charged past 70%. (Probably because it was constantly on). I only discovered this when it had been on the charger for a couple days and I started hearing a buzzing coming from it.  When I picked it up, I discovered it had been on all that time, and hadn’t charged.  When I put it on my head, the vision was shaking real bad and it couldn’t find the hand controllers and the guardian box was jumping all over my field of vision despite me not moving at all.  It also would not respond to efforts to reboot..  and felt hotter than it should.  I am sending it back and going to try one more.  I am super disappointed and I am hoping Amazon is not sending me some kind of factory ‘seconds’ because it wasn’t supposed to come till mid July then suddenly they had one?  I paid 499.00 for this and and annoyed I had to return it.  Im hoping the next one they are sending, will be a brand new one and will work properly.  Otherwise, Im gonna be done and will ask for a refund..  UPDATE. I changed it from 1 to 5 stars to get your attention so you will read the update..  I received the new headset much faster than previously promised .  It was a brand new one and it seems to work MUCH BETTER.  NO issues with turning on when plugged in to charger, battery charging fully and actually lasting longer than my Go did.  And it seems more responsive with no crazy software behavior.  I guess sometimes you just get a lemon.  Nothing is always perfect. Amazon made the return process quick and painless for me and paid for the return shipping.  That’s why I will keep shopping here.  👍

I’m having so much fun with this device! One thing that wasn’t apparent on the website is the ability to “cast” or stream whatever is being showed on the headset to a TV which makes it a lot of fun to play with family and friends.Favorite Game: Star Wars Vader Immortal- is stunning and so much fun. When I first saw Vader I got scared, not kidding I backed up a little when he walked into the room. It’s such an amazing feeling to be apart of the universe. I always saw myself as a smuggler or day dreamed of flying a space ship. The Quest makes it possible! I’m now a loyal customer.My one and a half complaints/wish list: though the Quest is so much fun and well worth the cost I was a little disappointed by the quality of some of the video. I’m not sure if this is because of the wireless nature of the device or the or the technology hasn’t quiet hit the mark of my 4K tv (hehe). That said, it’s still phenomenal and highly recommended. I also wished they could have provided more information about the product and functionality. As I mentioned above, I didn’t know you could “Cast” (see what the user sees) to a TV without digging around on YouTube and google reviews. I also struggled to find information about the headphones. The functionality information is not that big a deal for me and you can easily find tutorials on YouTube.I’m now curious as to the experience and video resolution of the other Oculus devices. I’m truly enjoying this purchase and the partnership with Star Wars (more please). I’m a very very casual gamer and can’t help but wonder if the video experience would improve if I purchase another of the devices. If you’re curious if it’s still worth it.... it is! I would have paid $1000 for this and personally surprised how fair the pricing is. Way to go Oculus! Can’t wait to see what is next. The future of gaming and entertainment is here. I can’t help but think of movies like Ready Player One, Surrogates, and The Gamer.

This was bought for my 13yr olds birthday but all 5 of us use it. My husband, myself, my 13yr old, 4 and 2.5yr old. The 2.5yr old just puts in for a few mins then takes it off he just likes seeing what our house looks like through the lenses usually then puts it down. I only allow my 4yr old on it one time a day when she does want to play it. I love beat saber, it reminds me of my old DDR days but you move your arms/hands and whole body instead of just your legs! My husband and son love the zombie/western/gun games and it's funny watched them crawl around on the floor or in full on dueling mode with whatever is coming at them lol! I cant play some of it bc it freaks me out lol anyway everything works wonderfully, have had zero issues. DEFINITELY buy a battery charger bc the controller does eat up the batteries unfortunately but to be expected with how much we play I suppose. I bought a hard case for it for my son and I really recommend that as well, we always stick it back in there when done. Its been dropped several times and been fine but this helps keep it up together and the case can drop vs the device.

My whole family (ages 6 - 75) and guests love playing on the Quest. We got the Go first to try VR and then got upgraded and got the Quest. There are so many games, virtual tours etc. Something for everyone. Bought a nice case to keep it in when not in use. Easy to set up and charge and download games. Headset adjusts easily. Really like being able to set up the guardian area to keep the player from running into something or hitting something. You set up the guardian area before you play a game either in the sitting position or standing position and give yourself lots of empty space around you. You follow the onscreen directions but basically with the headset on you touch the floor with your controller to set where the floor is and then use the controller to draw a red light around the empty space that will be safe for you to play in. While playing the game, if you go out of this area, the headset view will change to show you your actual room just like you would see it if you didn’t have the headset on. Then you can reposition yourself to play safer. If you change games or locations you redefine the guardian zone. Our family favorite game for everyone is Beat Saber. We have family contests to see who can score the highest or last the longest on the most difficult levels, lol. App is easy to use and shows battery life of each controller along with many other things. Some Quest games can be played Offline as well but they will not keep scores etc.

The Oculus Quest is so convenient that we have basically stopped using our Rift. While some games may be graphically underpowered now, games like Red Matter show the potential of the device. I swapped out the default headstrap for the Vive Pro Audio strap (it took two 3D printed pieces to attach) which is much more comfortable. I put an Anker battery on the back which helps balance the extra weight (my only complaint about the Quest) and it extends my battery life.I sideloaded Beat Saber to get custom songs and have also been able to stream SteamVR games to the headset (with fully working controllers and boundaries). I don't make games, but from what I have seen it is very dev-friendly. There is a tech demo on an unofficial app marketplace called Tea For God which showcases the amazing potential of non-tethered VR. It generates random hallways, elevators, ducts to crawl through, and enemies to shoot as you walk around your playspace. If your playspace is big enough, it feels like you have infinite space due to its use of non-Euclidean geometry.This is a console and screen all in one, which is a great value. I got the 128GB version and have installed 25 games/demos, using up about 80GB of space. There are complaints about the 2.5-3hrs of battery life, but I'm not sure who can play VR for that long without a break. It's also not an issue with the battery pack.Five stars, one of my favorite things I have ever bought.

The Oculus Quest was a bit of an impulse buy, and  ended up being way better than expected. I had never experienced VR before so I wasn’t sure what to expect. The immersive experience is quite amazing and takes getting used to. You’re able to virtually draw a boundary playing area to avoid hurting yourself or bumping into things. This boundary is interactive and warns you during game play when your approaching the line. The system was relatively easy to set up and use. There are a couple games that take you through tutorials on how to use the controllers. Space Pirate, Beat Sabre and Vader Immortal are my favorites. I wish there were More flying games. I.e. ability to fly a fighter jet etc.Pros-easy to use and set upAmazing immersive experience (Wander, Ocean rift are cool)Headset is not as heavy as I thought it would beAbility to cast your game to a TV screen so people can watch what you are doing.Many games available, and Several free demo games to get you goingHeadset maintains a charge for several hours and recharges relatively quickCons-It’s expensive. I got the 128G version and not sure I need that much spaceFor $500 I wish more free content was availableGames range from $10 and upWish the hand controllers were rechargeable vs battery. Another added cost to keep buying AA batteries But not a big deal.One player at a time- friends have to sit back and watch which may be boring to them.In summary- it’s a great product. A lot of fun but perhaps I suggest buying the smaller GB size version as a start. Hopefully Oculus will add more games to the library

I am a long time VR enthusiast having had VR headsets in the mid/late 90's (virtual-io glasses anyone?).  I have a Gen 1 Vive and an Index.  I had written Oculus off after they were acquired by facebook and never even considered any of their products until the Quest.There were two reasons, well three actually but the third is pretty unique to my situation, that led me to purchase the Quest.The first was the Jon Carmack interview on the Joe Rogan Podcast where he was talking about the Quest which really piqued my interest.  The second was a friend of mine who had used my Vive (gen 1) and a friends PiMax bought one and was raving about how much fun it was.The third reason was that I could get my company to pay for half of it through a wellness program.  See, I primarily bought it so I could take it with me when I travel.  That way I could exercise with it in the hotel room since I am trying to commit to being more active, a VR fitness program combined with an 80% travel schedule (that's M-Thu every week) seemed like a great idea.  And the subsidy made it kind of a no brainer.I have had my Quest for 3-4 months now and I still recommend it as the most cost effective VR setup on the market today.  Yes, my Index is a far superior product and fits much better and has better tracking, and, and, and.  It also cost $1000 bucks on top of the money I spent on a computer to run it.  All in all I have approx 3K sunk into my PC based VR solution, the quest is 1/6th of that and easily delivers at least 50% of the same experience.Here's the good:* Portable - sets up in minutes* Best VR Bang for the Buck - A lot of reviews complaining you have to buy games.  duh.  same as any other console out there.  Drop 2-300 bucks on an xbox/ps4/switch and you are still paying for games.* Software updates enable operation as a PC VR headset (this. is. gamechanging.)Here's the bad -* Comfort/Fit - is front heavy and the straps have limited adjustment. my 7yr old loves it, 4 year old has a hard time (the index works great for both)* stock audio solution sucks and there are no decent aftermarket solutions (the index speakers are amazing and have spoiled me completely)* hard to spectate - you can cast to a phone/tablet/chromecast and while its gotten much better, its not fantastic.  Watching people play in VR is a lot of fun but hard to do on the quest.Neutral* Seems to be more nausea inducing than my Index - Tends to happen when I am using the sticks to move in games rather than teleporting.  could also be because its dropping frames due to being less powerful than my pc based headsets.Overall :This is a great product for the price.  Some folks are having QC issues and that happens.  Support is also probably running slower due to the holidays.  Neither is a reason in my opinion not to buy it as you are going to have those issues with just about any product on the market.  I see no evidence that it is worse with the quest.If you are wanting to get into VR and don't have a PC already that is VR capable, this is a fantastic choice.  I have recommended it to several people I know and everyone is very pleased with the results.  With the addition of PC VR capabilities, it just makes it even more of a strong recommendation.Its not perfect, and while I still have some reservations about giving facebook money, the Quest is still a really good value for the money.

Many people ask what's the future of VR, and Oculus gives us the answer.  Oculus Quest is a truly standalone system with 6 degrees of freedom.  It gives you true immersive experience and setup is a no-brainer.  No more clucky wire tangling.  Although the picture quality isn't as good as Vive, it doesn't bother me whatsoever.  Room scale and wireless features with 6DOF is a total game changer.  I would give a 5 star if only if the weight can be proper distribute.  There is too much weight on the headset and your cheekbone or forehead may feel the pressure after 20-30 minutes of playtime.  I kinda hack it by adding a little weight to the back of the headset to counterbalance the weight and it feels so much better.  I have to say PSVR is the most comfortable headset among all the competition.  Oculus definitely heading to the right direction, I really look forward they launch Quest 2 with lighter weight.

I absolutely love this product! It's the best bang for your bucks right now for the VR experience! I have had a blast playing the games available for it. There are a few draw backs and recommendations I would make for it, those being:- The battery life is short, sometimes too short, especially when you are downloading games during game play. External battery packs / battery banks will extend play time.- The silicone cushions you can buy for them are highly recommended, because they will catch sweat really good. But they slip on over the original pad, so they slide around or off easily.- The head straps don't have a lot of grip on long hair. They work better with short hair or if you pull your hair back in a ponytail or a God awful ""man bun"". The straps will stay better and you won't have to keep pulling them back down.The strap pads are a joke so buyer beware on those. Mine busted on it's first adjustment. Inferior material was to blame.- Since it runs off a Cellphone processor, hence the reason to download the Oculus app on your phone, it takes FOREVER sometimes to download games. Clearing out your phone with unnecessary apps and pics will help this but it will still take a while.I would still recommend this product to anyone wanting to get into the VR experience without having to buy the $1k goggles and the $$$ gaming PC to run it. Just may want to get some additional add-on's for the goggles and controllers.

Everything you wanted and more. I had used a friends HTC Vive connected to a $2000 gaming PC and this meets and beats it. It meets the Vive in visual quality. I’m sure the stats are lower for the Quest but I can’t see it. I’m no pro VR guy but I truly can’t tell a difference. It beats the Vive in the obvious way of being 100% portable and it doesn’t require sensors in your room. I was worried it wouldn’t track as well as the Vive because of that but I’ve had no issues. When we first got it we immediately started playing without charging it. It was about 60% charged. At 20% it started losing the guardian. We were thinking it was a glitch but we think it was just too low of battery. Once we charged it and even since, with a low battery, we haven’t had it happen. We also started looking at the developer mode for side loading and haven’t had any issues there either. That was one of our concerns as to whether you could do it with this headset like you could the Vive and you can. YouTube was immensely helpful and you can do it on Mac too. A lot of sites say side loading is only available through PC but we did it with Mac.

Won't take a charge, no matter what I try and I tried all the tricks with different chargers, cables, charging directly from a PC, etc.  Same with holding buttons and different combos of buttons down.  Now, my $500 Quest, which I loved so much, has become a totally useless brick.  I opened a support ticket with Oculus, so I guess I'll have to see what they say.  They said on chat that I may have violated the warranty because I used an external battery pack.  Um, TONS of people have been using these to extend play time while still keeping it 100% self-contained and not tethered to a wall charger.  And, these external packs have been used extensively ever since the Quest first came out!

I have to candid, I did not understand the uproar about VR, and then I saw a friend's Oculus Cosmo playing Alyx and Holy Cow!. It was like I was really there and I haven't been anywhere since we've all been locked up.The choice between a PC version or a Mobile version is why I choose the Quest. I didn't want some add-on to my PC. This has changed so many ways I interact with people now. Facebooks, Recroom, BigScreen with Movies. I've been around the world and never left my house: the Games, social interaction with people worldwide. I thought I would use this maybe one time a week, but now I'm using it daily. There are just so many places to get, so many people to meet.Now with a simple link cable, I can play all the PC VR games as well.I bought the 128 GB version, but I've never gone over 30GB, so I can't recommend the extra memory. Memory is only needed for additional games or movies. I wish I bought this sooner and highly recommend anyone to buy this and escape your mind to see the world.

As an owner of The Oculus Phone powered headset and the Oculus Rift (and a PlayStation VR) I find the Quest wireless system to be way more user friendly. You are free to move anyway and anywhere you like. The new Guardian Safety zone feature is way better than the Rift. The headset is somewhat heavier than the others but that's expected do to the cameras and hardware to support it. I do not like the solid rubber headset straps but the built in speaker system works great. Headphones are even better. Im not happy with the Beta ""Casting"" feature to Chromecast yet. They need to fix that. (it doesn't always work). The games are limited but new ones are being added weekly and ome of them are cross platform so if you own it for the Rift it cam be downloaded for free for the Quest ( and vice versa). Battery life is not as long as I like but you can get an external power block cheap enough to extend play.The Graphics are great for the games they have so far. The controllers seem to use more battery than the Rift ( had to replace mine after about 4 hrs of use but that was playing games (Boxing) that require constant use of the controller. Im sure if you were just watching videos or exploring other worlds they would last longer. I switched to rechargable ""A"" batteries for the controllers.It needs a case to protect it and you need to keep some lens cleaners around (lens gets dirty fast). I am a VR person from the start  and overall I love this headset and look forward to more title releases and Hardware upgrades to give the Quest a near perfect score. I give it a 9 out of 10 due to the headstraps ( which I dislike alot).

After being surprisingly impressed by the experience when trying a frined's Rift a couple of years ago, I'd been awaiting a chance to get on board the VR train. The biggest road block for me was not the price of the headset itself but the price of the powerful gaming PC that I would need to run things. I'd previously managed to find a cheap GeatVR headset for my Samsung S7, and while that was entertaining, it lacked the power and two-handed Touch control system of the full Oculus system. From the moment I saw the Quest concept, I knew it was the way to go and pre-ordered my headset long before they started shipping. I had considered the Oculus Go but to me, it seemed like little more than a convenient GearVR. I went for the 128GB as historically with such things, what seems like overkill on launch day, turns out to be a neccessity a few years down the line.The 6-degrees of freedom (6DoF) offered by the Quest is absolutely necessary for a fully immersive experience. With no cables to worry about and a reasonably sized play space, you will gets lost in the VR world. Having not been a keen cutting-edge gamer for many years, the reduction of graphical quality betwen this and PC based systems was negligible to my mind. What is more important is the experience, not photo realistic imagery. The twin Touch controllers really allow intuative interaction with the virtual world. Some of the early experiences are true showcases for the platform and Robo Recall and Beat Saber really lend themselves to this platform. In addition to the gaming aspect, I often use the Quest to watch Netflix and other online video streams without disturbing the rest of the family. I tend to wake up early and can happily sit in bed watching and browsing until everyone else gets up.To address some common negative comments... Unlike many, I have rarely found the headset uncomfortable, even during extended play. My 14 yo daughter, who weights around 100lb soaking wet, also has no issue with the weight and balance of the headset. I get 2-3 hours of gameplay out of the battery, which is usually telling me it's time to take a break and I've played seated experiences or watched video while plugged in. I've rarely had any technical glitches of note and struggle to find fault with the Quest. The fact it is often unavailable tells you that the hype is translating into sales that exceeded production and that can only be a good thing as developers see the commercial sense in adapting existing VR titles and creating new ones for Quest.

The OCULUS Quest is everything I wanted it to be. Do I wish there were other games for it, yes, but there are a lot of games already. I have a PSVR, OCULUS Rift and OCULUS Quest and each one has its own amazing qualities as well as its own flaws. Overall, I love the Quest...not having wires and sensors that need to be setup and calibrated each time is awesome. Of course the OCULUS Rift has a better gaming selection in my opinion but it also takes a pretty stout PC with a rather robust video card in order to play the games. Since the PC is actually running and processing the game they can have different games that the Quest probably wouldn't be able to process in the built in system inside of the headset. There are quite a few games that are cross play between the Rift and Quest and look almost identically on both. If you are looking for something that is easily portable and still a lot of fun then the Quest is an all around amazing portable but powerful VR headset.

I went into this expecting a better version of the Gear VR headset from Samsung. Boy oh boy was I wrong.This thing is the next best thing to actually being in the worlds these games and experiences depict. I bought The Thrill of the Fight, a VR boxing game, and when I started fighting the first level boxer I swear I expected to feel the punches he was landing on me, and I found myself fighting as though I was in a real life street brawl. So realistic!I also tried Amazon Prime VR, and felt like I was in a movie theater watching my Prime videos. It's incredible how advanced this gadget is.I can't even describe how responsive the sensors are; you move IRL and your avatar in the game space moves instantly. With six degrees of movement, you can traverse all the movements and motions your real body can make. It's truly indescribable. All I can say is, you have to try this. Seeing is believing.

I have shared this about a dozen friends, family and co-workers past few days. Several of them have since ordered their own Quest due to the experience being so overwhelmingly positive. Titles shared are the usual suspects that win users over immediately: Space Pirate Trainer, Beat Saber, Super Hot, Job Simulator (winner of the most laughs award).The release content is mediocre in size currently, but I'm satisfying with the quality of all of them. There's absolutely something for everyone. Oculus has been good in the past with expanding the library quickly. Now with the Quest selling like hotcakes, there is no doubt Developers will have all the resources they need to expand into more polished AAA titles soon to come.5 Stars without a moment of hesitation!

Hands down the best VR Headset on the market! While the HTC Vive Pro may be better in graphics you just can't beat the cordless part of this! It makes all the difference in the world. I was using a PS4 VR Headset before and I barely used it because the cords were such a pain and the whole thing was really complicated to set up.This headset is so easy to use. I love watching movies in it and I LOVE Big Screen for chatting with others. Such a fun fun device. I highly recommend it.The immersive art programs are so fun and the games are great. I have spoken to people in VR that tell me they are in there for hours all day! Crazy! It's like Ready Player One in there!I just read that they are coming out with an update in November (2019) that will allow you to hook this headset to a PC. That makes this system EVEN BETTER. I can't wait for that as well as the awesome had tracking update coming in December! Buy this! Trust me! You will be happy!The only issue is that the VR headset is front-heavy and a little uncomfortable. I purchased a different front cushion part here on Amazon for it and it helps quite a bit.Still give this five stars despite the front-heavy part because you get soooo much with this unit that it more than makes up for the minor uncomfortability.

UPDATE: the 3rd unit predictably failed after 1 month of use, like the other two. The usual cycle - 1 month of use, then 2 weeks waiting for replacement. I don't do anything funny with Quest, literally playing 2 games - Beat Saber and BoxVR. That's it.Support is useless beyond simple device swap out. They are not willing to schedule pickup instead of drop off or send an replacement in advance to reduce waiting time. On top of that, they refuse to escalate the issue, even after 6 requests in a row.This is unbelievable. When this (4th!) unit fails in a month from now, I'm sending it back for a refund while I still can, and switching to more reliable alternative with better customer service.====OLD REVIEWFantastic product when it works. I’ve got 2 units in a row failing after a month of use with boot loop, a known problem for at least 6 months.

I have a PSVR, but wanted this to play some of the exclusives on the Oculus. I love that this is wireless, and I literally sit for hours just messing with it. I love the Netflix app, the games are great, the ease was awesome.The bad is that there is a huge gap around the nose piece. No one seems to be talking about this, but it's a huge distraction especially since you need to use this in the light. (I ended up stuffing some tissue paper in the gap, and it helped ALOT. So I guess that is a tip for ya'll)The controllers are great, but they are light. I'm used to having a controller having a little weight to them, so that was noticeable, but other may not notice.Also, another huge issue is that there is a ""reflective"" effect when playing some games. It really noticeable when the light hits the lenses at a certain angle. I can literally see the circles in the eye piece. It takes you out of the game every time.However, all in all I do really enjoy the purchase and don't regret it. I'm excited to see the next version come out that is not only more powerful, but fixes some of these issues. A lot of the games I got for PSVR, and most likely won't be rebuying them. So in that respect the selection is kinda slim.If you don't have a VR system I would 100% recommend this. You don't need anything else. If you have a PSVR I would also recommend for the exclusives and the wireless features. Other than that you might want to do more research. Good luck!

For what it is at the price it is it's a great buy, but it is limited compared to high end HMDs. The graphics aren't high end but they are actually pretty good, especially happy about the mechanical ipd. My main gripe is the tracking. Is it horrible, no. Is it noticeable enough that I have started to change how I stand or hold my hands in VR, yes and that is at best immersion breaking and at worst makes some games frustrating to play. One and done beat saber maps are a no go even on normal as at some point in a map, tracking will cost me a miss. Natural pitching or batting motions get lost if hands are held too far back for more than a second or two. Aiming with pistols is noticeably inaccurate compared to OG rift although not as bad as the rift S it seems. So glad I didn't buy one of those. Also not great but better than rift s is the sound, which is substandard compared to OG rift in every way and I much prefer the OG rift audio. It doesn't sound very good, get very loud, or have any bass plus it periodically starts making this vibrating sound almost like a blown speaker and even when not actually sucking you're still bleeding sound into the house so it practically requires headphones to be used with it and since it doesn't support Bluetooth headphones that means a wire you know for the wireless headset.Also it's heavy. Most people struggle with wearing it for more than an hour and some can't take it after half that and everyone is constantly adjusting it.

Honestly, this was fun until I decided to return it. Some of the games are fun, and the return policy is very generous. I found lack of variety to be the issue here. Every game is either shoot zombies, shoot people, or anything having to do with rhythm. This is NOT what you get solely for gaming. This is more of a console for kids playing games with their siblings. If you don't have friends that will play with you a lot, this might not be that great. Still, this might just not be for me. I plan on purchasing a rift s sometime in the future when I can afford it. Overall, a nice console, but it isn't for everyone. This is probably best for kids that don't have a gaming pc and adults that don't have a gaming pc. If you want to watch movies, either buy an oculus go or buy a TV. VR isn't a replacement for a gaming pc, I almost learned that the hard way with this thing.

I own an original Vive, Samsung Hmd Odyssey and the 5K+ Pimax. I bought this 3 weeks ago. And have since linked it to the Rift then side-loading it to play steam vr games. While not nearly as sharp as those hmds this is my goto unit. No freaking wires, double tap the side strap and I see my living room. While it can play all of the Rift games, I have problems with some steam games (can't figure out how to reload in Hover Junkers, no touch pad).  Really the only thing that pisses me off is the controller batteries. The batteries in the vive wands seem to last forever but then that is due to being hooked up to the charger. The Oculus uses AA batteries which die in 2 days. They don't even discharge at the same rate. And if you use a silicone grip cover it's just a hassle to change them out. I here that FB is coming out with new controllers, I hope power management is upgraded.

I've owned a Gear VR before paired with a Galaxy S8. Didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised when it came in. Here's a list of pros and cons:Pros:- Inside out tracking is amazing and wireless play with roomscale blows my mind- This device is so versatile due to Oculus supporting Oculus link to allow for a wired PCVR experience. Plus using the virtual desktop app you can also do wireless PCVR. Your mileage will vary with these options, but mine was flawless and opened up so many opportunities- The headset is certainly powerful enough to play some simpler games installed on it- Very glasses friendly headset with physical IPD adjustment- Controllers feel nice- Finger tracking in beta and it's pretty awesome- SideQuest has a plethora of additional apps to try out but use at your own discretion.Cons:- The comfort is hit or miss. I immediately added a battery counterweight which helps. The device is still very front heavy and the padding is a sweat magnet and a little rough- Oculus Quest and oculus rift games are not cross compatible, so buying games from the quest store severely limits where it's usuable. Thankfully PCVR solves this by letting you play steam and rift games on PC- Light leak from the nose area is a minor complaint, you'll probably forget about it when in any game- The godrays are pretty annoying. Not sure how it compares to rift cv1 though.All in all, I love using this headset. Tinkering with comfort and software is fun to me. Can take it anywhere and tether it to my OC whenever I want to play more demanding games :)

I had my Rift for a few years, and I wasn't planning on upgrading until something really revolutionary came along. But then I heard about the Oculus Link feature, which lets you plug in this normally untethered headset, and get the full PC-powered experience. And >then< I noticed that Amazon pays pretty good money for your used Rift, if you still have all the packaging and stuff.I bought the Quest right after the Link feature hit beta, and it's been great. When you start the Link feature, it makes it the exact same experience as with the Rift, except with a lot more resolution (and only one USB cord, as opposed to lots of cables necessary for the Rift.) Or you can use it unplugged, which is great for games like Thrill of the Fight and Robo Recall.I wouldn't call this a ""revolutionary"" upgrade from the Rift by any means, but it is a noticeable one, and it's fun to be able to bring it out to the living room for guests to try, and not have to have people crowd into your computer room. An easy recommendation.

I tried the demo at Best Buy and thought it was really fun, and I figured it would be a great way to pass the time during quarantine. Boy, was I wrong.First of all, this thing loses tracking constantly. It seems like every 20 or 30 minutes it says ""tracking lost"" and I have to redraw the boundary. Or I get caught in an infinite loop where I draw the boundary, click confirm, and it starts over and makes me draw it again, forcing me to do a hard reset (holding the power button until it turns off).And that's not the only time I have to do a hard reset. Usually, when I pick it up and try to play a game, it freezes and I have to restart the whole thing, which can take a very long time.While some of the games can be kind of fun at first, the novelty wears off fast, and you realize you're just playing a cheap game where the screen happens to be right in front of your eyes. And the only decent games are $20-$30 each.I thought it would be fun to watch 360 videos or Google streetview, and although it's interesting to be able to look around, the image is very blurry and pixelated, even on high-def videos. And if I watched for too long, I get dizzy and nauseous.If you're debating whether this thing is worth the money, I'm here to tell you that it isn't. Please, use your money on something that won't get old within a month.

I love the fact that their are no wires.  The Guardian feature, which lets you draw out a safe play space and then warns you if you get outside of it is awesome.  Tracking and the ""VR"" experience are really good.  Very smooth, never gets lost, tracks even tiny movements perfectly.  It's really incredible how well the VR part works.  Games aside (more on that later), there is some amazing 360/VR video content that is just mindblowing.  However, it does fall noticeably short in graphics quality and there really aren't many games.  What games there are often have only a few levels and you can exhaust all your options in an hour or so.  Basically, everything feels like a demo - even the ones that cost $30 or more.  Also, it's not so fun at parties because some of the more active games cause people to sweat into the soft, absorbent cloth cushion around the frame that sits on your face which can get gross fast.  Still, it's amazing and if the content catches up to the capability, it'll be the coolest thing I own.

I had previously tried out the Samsung Gear.  It was cool, dont get me wrong, but I wasn't very impressed.  Lots of SDE (Screen Door Effect), and graphics just didnt seem ready yet.  Phone heating up and causing a lot of problems after 5 minutes was annoying as well.  Switched over to the PSVR.  It was slightly better, but became aggravating with all of the cables and setup each time.Came across the Quest a few days ago when I was searching headsets again and was shocked that it was wireless.  So I figured I'd give it a try.I am completely blown away.  The graphics are way better than the PSVR.  And not having the cables is truly a remarkable step forward.  You can put this on WHEREVER you go without the need for an outside unit to plug into.  Truly incredible.It's very simple to use, and despite the fact that when I looked at tbe controllers and first thought ""ah, that's a learning curve"", no, they're fantastic.  They're very simple and very fluid.  Almost a rewarding feeling when you are using them.Oculus did a fantastic job with this.  Cant wait to see where VR is in 10 years from now.

The Oculus Quest is probably the best “cheap” VR headset you’re going to find out there. Without the requirement for a display port, and the ability to steam games (no both officially and “unofficially”, through various means), it is the best compromise between affordability and good VR experience out there. That being said, it does come with setbacks. Streaming games the “unofficial“ way requires a ridiculous amount of bandwidth, and even then, you will probably experience some lag. If you don’t stream games, the Oculus library is fairly limited, and not to mention expensive, with not many sales to speak of. That being said, there are pros as well. Finger tracking is pretty good, and getting better as we speak. It has a feature to set your own boundaries as well, making sure you don’t embarrass yourself by running into your real-life surroundings while playing VR games. All-in-all, the Oculus Quest is not a bad headset whatsoever, especially considering the price. I would definitely recommend it as a beginner VR headset for those looking to start out their journey into the VR world.

First of all, I love the Quest and use it everyday. However, when my left controller had a problem after only 2 months of use I contacted customer support. After 4 days of back and forth and having to supply a lot of information (which is understandable), they told me I would have to return the controller so they could look at it before they would send a replacement. My wife and I have incorporated the Quest into our daily exercises program and it is a big deal not being able to use it for the time it is taking to get a replacement. I tried to convince them to send me a replacement and I would then send back the original, but they did not budge. Again, love the product, but be cautious about the support if something goes wrong.

I love the wireless aspect of this unit, it also holds a charge for a decent amount of time. The controllers get slippery after awhile because of sweaty palms, and the head unit is unbalanced which causes the device to feel a lot heavier than initally thought. The glasses input did little for my comfort experience and creates a gap at the nose bridge.Games are slowly trickling in for this unit, so I wait with anticipation. The most annoying thing is having to sign into apps on your phone or computer with codes that you can only see while wearing the unit...which means you can't see a computer screen or your phone. I would rather sign in with email and pass and then confirm later, even if that meant being unable to use the service until I did so. BUT that is less a unit problem and more of an app developer problem.The room scaling can be a little wonky, even when manually measuring the space around me, it seems to take in an inch or two from those measurements which can make me glitch through walls and floors in games.TLDR; Great unit, little heavy, slowly getting new apps/games, room scaling could be worked on. Would definitely recommend to buy.

I've been in the VR game since awaiting the arrival of the Oculus DK2, and got both a Vive and a Rift before later getting the Quest (my first 'inside out' tracking headset).It's now my favorite, largely for the wireless and portability aspects.  Due to it being a closed ecosystem (officially at least) until Oculus Link (PC tethering) comes out of beta, there are some game types I just can't play with it like driving or flight sims (DCS, Elite Dangerous, etc.).  Once Link is generally available and stable though I'm hoping to use it for those too.Otherwise I enjoy the non-fuss usage of it and don't really miss the graphics quality differences between it and the PC based VR games (I didn't even really notice any until others pointed it out anyway).I also successfully took it on ""vacation"" (wasn't a vacation for me, just the rest of the fam) from US to Europe without any issues or content access restrictions, and beats having to lug around all the other gear normally required for that.Downsides for me are as follows:- Play area has to be decently lit but not overpowered.  It doesn't like dim twilight, it also doesn't like glaring direct sunlight.  The tracking cameras are a bit on the simple side in this respect.  My other VR headsets I used to enjoy playing in the dark at night (with the tracking lighthouses/devices happily talking in the dark using IR), but this one I have to keep the lights on to play.  A minor inconvenience with small children around that need to stay asleep at night.- Ecosystem is new and therefore the software catalog for it is very low/light still.  I mean the store has a good number of games in it, but you will only like a smaller subset of those.  The library is growing over time but the pace is slow due both to Oculus' tight controls over which dev titles they are approving, and the increased difficulty on devs to convert/write games for the Quest (essentially mobile device gaming hardware levels) to meet its concessions.  I'm hopeful for me personally that Oculus Link will then blow the doors off this issue, as I already have a PC VR library of games to play, although this isn't ideal for everybody and returning to tethered play isn't a direction I'm fully keen on doing either.  Still, I think I'd take that compromise to be back to having a fuller library to play for now.- Being fairly new and the devs not being experienced at bringing games to market on this kind of VR device, means they are sometimes glitchy and can hard crash or start to cause motion stuttering (loss of tracking) temporarily, throwing off the immersion levels and satisfaction of working with a 'plug and play' system as this.  Anecdotally I feel that the devs do address these things, but I do also feel like they're problems I wouldn't have had in their PC VR counterparts in the first place (some titles I play, I have both the Quest and non-Quest versions of, that I can use as direct comparisons here).Still, using this headset beats most of the inconveniences of PC VR for me (like USB craziness of the Rift, the inconvenience of having to setup a dedicated play space with wires and base stations, the time and hassle to move and re-setup to play anywhere else, etc.), and the other issues seem to have improved over time.  I've had my Quest now since I think early August, and that's been enough time for me to see it trending in the right direction.Also being untethered and wireless makes sharing VR with others a simpler proposition, as I don't worry about them running out of bounds and dragging my PC off the table (and/or them ending up in ER from leg/neck cable lasso issues), and they no longer need to go to VR, VR can go to them.I did get a few accessories to help things along, such as: rechargable USB battery, so in a pinch I can keep the device running/charging when I misjudge its remaining power and it's about to shut down for a recharge (otherwise it's usually good for about 3-4 hours of play per day, with an overnight charge), and either disposable eyemasks or my preference, a ski/bikers balaclava with 'wicking' fabric to keep me overall cooler and less sweaty for gunking up the headset.  I also use rechargable AA batteries for the touch controllers (one in each) that I already had.  All this, plus the carry case for my portability needs, rounds out the Quest for me as the best I can currently get for VR today.

Then charger went out.  Then i noticed the haze was caused by scratches INSIDE the lens as well as outside.  None of us wear glasses and were extremely careful.  They obviously sent be a refurb.Oculus support wanted too much crap from me.  My time is not free.

I have truly enjoyed this headset and it has transformed the VR industry for the better. Some games, such as Supernatural, even gives you a good workout. But, as the games are becoming more and more active, so does your head movement. This is where Oculus need to improve. The only way to get a snug enough fit to avoid your eyes from moving away from the optimal position, is to pull the straps that goes behind your neck to the point where your blood circulation stops and you’ll start feeling numb in your scalp. It’s not a pleasant feeling.When the new Star Wars game (Tales from the Galaxy) was released I was quick to download it and try it out. Unfortunately, while playing the game, the headset overheated, the screen start flickering and shortly after went black. I haven’t been able to restart the headset since. The headset’s warranty has expired 5 months ago and Oculus has declined to offer any help with repairs or replacement, neither have they offered to refund any of the games purchased over the past year. I’m now stuck with a $500 piece of electronic junk. A bit of googling shows that this issue is not an isolated incident - many others have experienced similar issues. This is a sign of premature release to manufacturing and sales in a greedy and desperate attempt to become the market leader, while reliability and quality has been set aside. It’s time to step up your customer service Oculus, if you want to maintain your loyal fan base and early adopters.

Absolutely love this device. I use it somewhere in the realm of 1-4 hours a day, and haven't gotten tired of it yet, despite only playing 3 or 4 games. Being able to play Beat Saber 360° songs is awesome without worrying about a tether. I was spending $20-$30 every couple weeks, going to a VR arcade for 30 minutes to an hour each session. I've even used it on a plane to watch movies in total privacy via Skybox (with headphones of course) and it actually helped the space feel bigger.This is the perfect intro to VR. I plan to build a PC and either use Oculus Link to play some skyrim, or just buy a Vive for my home setup and have the Quest be my travel/party machine.Note that the controllers sometimes have tracking issues, but that's to be expected with an inside-out tracking system. It honestly doesn't happen as often as I would think.At the price point, I'd take the Quest over any gaming console, but I already had plenty of VR experience and knew exactly what I wanted out of the Quest.

There isn't much I can say except that this is one amazing device. It's not perfect, but I'm incredibly impressed with the amount of thought that went into it. I've bought most of the software titles on the store and they are very interesting. One thing that I found surprising is that I don't feel that much more immersed in a game with the Quest as I would be just playing on a flat screen monitor. It's just a different way of interacting which occasionally gives me (not unpleasant) feelings of vertigo.One thing I should mention is that I think the Quest is not very good with glasses, even though they took steps to accommodate them. I am somewhat nearsighted and have small lens glasses, but they get shoved up against my face and are not very comfortable. However, I find that I can see about as well without them on as I can with them while wearing the Quest. I'm hoping that as the resolution of future VR screens increase and blurriness becomes an actual problem as it is in real life, Oculus can let me fix some of my nearsightedness with an adjustment control for the lenses.

The Creed boxing game has you in a sweat and looking up at opponents. The Darth Vader game has you using the force and light sabers. It is literally out of this world. Games are purchased through the Oculus app. It is not stagnant gameplay either. I am also blind in one eye, and you do not need stereo vision for this to work. You can even watch YouTube videos.

Recently purchased the 128GB system as a gift. What a wonderful experience, for the first thirty minutes. The left controller lost connection, and upon contacting Oculus support (after some failed troubleshooting suggestions like removing the batteries and putting in new ones) I was asked to ship the controller back to Oculus.The shipping is by Ground, and there is no way to expedite it. So the turn around time from broken controller--within 30 minutes of unboxing--to getting a return is roughly a month: six business days to return, plus three to five days for Oculus to evaluate the controller, plus six business days for shipment of a new and hopefully working controller.A poor performance.

I have been wanting to get into the VR world for quite some time.  However, there was always two primary barriers, price and quality of experience.Before the quest you had really two options.  You could spend a lot of money on a quality setup with a gaming PC and then create a dedicated space for your VR gaming in 6DOF but you where locked to that space and tethered to it quite literally by cables.The other option was much cheaper and mobile with 'drop-in' headsets for phones and other similar setups but with no tracking for controllers this was really just a view experience and wasn't all that much fun outside the initial novelty.Enter the Quest.This is what I have been waiting for.  A quality experience, with controller tracking, 6 DOF and full portability.  Its perfect for playing, experiencing or any of the above.  I have taken it to work, friends, parents and grandparent.  Literally everyone who tries it comes away with a HUGE SMILE on their face and expresses how awesome it is.  You will consistently hear them saying ""this is crazy"" ""this is so cool"" ""wow, I can't believe how real this feels"".There aren't as many games as you would ideally want in the long term.  However, I consider this the same way I would when a new console launches.  There are a few titles to start but as the console gains momentum the titles will follow suite shortly.  In the mean time there is plenty to explore.If you have considered VR at any point.  Wait no longer.  This is what you have been waiting for!

At first it may make you feel dizzy, for the first few times use it for 10 minutes at a time and slowly increase your use time, you will get used to it and it will feel natural.

While I cannot compare it to anything else all I can say it is a wonderful and effective tool to get one to move about and actually exercise. The available ability levels in the games make it games to grow into. The mask doesn't seem overly heavy and I have it pulled back as instructed but I have gaps on either side of my nose that don't cause too much distraction. I wear glasses so I have utilized the spacer but it seems a bit tight in there. I did learn today that one can get from Oculus prescription inserts and reasonably priced. This Quest is a great tool for exercise, adventure, games, and with the free Prime app, it is like sitting and watching a movie on an Imax screen. It is great to step into a video game of sorts and bust a move, break a sweat and feel better.

UPDATE: I originaly wrote a 1 star review because it didn't work. Tech Support was originally unresponsive and their forums showed genuinely THOUSANDS with the same issue every month back to June 2019. Well, if your Oculus Quest doesn't work, I highly recommend being patient and going to the main Oculus website and find the CHAT support (it's not easily found). Look for green chat icon bottom right in chrome. I reported the issue, had to wait in queue for about an hour but someone DID document it and said it would take 3-4 days. I checked this morning and EVERYTHING was fixed, all items installed, there appears to have been a firmware and software update. The UI is slight different but looks upgraded. The Touch controlers are more responsive and less glitchy. And I have no problem installing software from the store now. That was less than 12 hours when they quotes 3-4 days. I think that's stelar. It's just unfortunate the issues are clearly being shipped as is. Thinking it's definitely firmware and software related and seems consistent with most of the same reported issues.TO OCULUS: Thank you for triaging my concern very rapidly. I recommend forcing a firmware/software check on all purchases Oculus Quest (and possibly other versions) as soon as they install it. It's better to let users know that upfront rather than discovering it themselves. People are more apt to accept a slight delay out of the box rather than once fully imersed. I would have rated 5 stars but the issues from the get go would not be right to give it 5 star rating. NOW it's definitely working 5 star worthy.

The Quest is awesome for what it is. No need for sensors on wall or a computer. My son plays Quest while I play Rift CV1 and we can play together in some games. Battery life is 2 hrs . Compared to the CV1 the controllers and straps feel really cheaply made. Head set feels comfortable enough for 2 hrs. Graphics are great . I would recommend to use head phones for the ones who want a better experience, with out headphones it is lame since you can hear everything around you in the real world. Using them you will be able to hear all the details in the game.1 flaw i see is in some games if you need to grab items behind back or near face the sensors do not pick up hand controller and it glitches in VR game.It was worth the buy IMO.

It's great to have everything in this headset, you don't need a computer to go along with it (unlike the Oculus Rift, the earlier product). The Oculus Quest doesn't have any dangling wires at all. It's true, it's not perfect, there's issues with the headset being front-heavy (it has a built-in battery), and it can be blurry if not adjusted perfectly (but all VR systems are blurry, there is no perfect VR yet, we still have several decades to go before Ready Player One).

I will admit that I was an early adopter of the PSVR. That ended up being a bit clunky (gave me motion sickness) and it was a pain in the neck because everything had to be tethered and set up a certain way.  I LOVE the fact that the Oculus Quest is completely standalone (it can interact with the app on your phone though). Very immersive experiences! The ""Lobby"" almost brought me to tears because it looked like a ski cottage in Colorado (a place I very much want to be), but it couldn't be because the beautiful northern lights were streaming across the sky. They have apps to calm you if you have anxiety (I do), they have active apps, and of course games. They also have a TON of free content that comes with the headset. I am looking forward to seeing how the games progress. A lot of them, while immersive, aren't realistic (sort of animated versions of reality). I will be the first in line to buy games that feel like you're on the holodeck in Star Trek. However, this is leaps and bounds above anything I have seen. Highly worth the price!

This is a great intro to the world of VR. It works with very little prodding out of the box, and is overall just a great platform for games and immersive video. The hand tracking works like a charm, there's a great variety of things to be done with it (some great exclusive experiences like Climb VR, and more). It really shows how much can be done with a little android processor. I've also really enjoyed the link capability, and have been using it for more graphically intensive experiences like Google Earth (where I sadly flew around the parts of Spain that my wife and I were planning to visit on a now cancelled-due-to-Covid Honeymoon trip. Additionally, there's a wide world of creatives making weird little experiences for the platform in the sidequest store.My only complaint is occasional discomfort due to the weight, but it's not a serious complaint at all.

Nice system, 4 stars for the implementation,  1 star for the ergonomic issue with the glasses,  2 stars for lack of app info about known issues that cause play problems.  I am afraid the glasses issue will slowly ruin the Quest lenes, I am already seeing scratching  issues.  Some bugs in the apps requiring me to contact support for a know problem, they are fixing.Also, I have tried three pair of eye glasses, with the included spacer, and they still touch the eye lenses.  They are all wire frame glasses and fit close to my face.  It is starting to scratch the lens. May end up returning.

The Oculus Quest hardware does what it supposed to do. I enjoy the immersive experience with movies and a few of the games I have tried. The problem I have with it is the games are too expensive and many of them don't have a try before you buy feature. After dropping $400 on a device, I certainly don't want to drop another $50 on each game, many of which I have tried are not very good. Facebook needs to work on its pricing structure, otherwise, I'll watch an occasional movie, play some pinball, and wait for NBA to return. (The courtside seats are worth the investment, if your're an NBA fan.)

Wireless, an immersive feature not even available on setups costing 10x the price. While the graphics are not the very best (it is a mobile processor) the immersion and overall experience, display, and apps, and completely wireless functionality makes it a breakthrough game changer. No other device offers this combo of performance, and capability at  its price point. The new Link cable option allows you to use it to with a VR capable PC if you want to to meet or exceed the ($4000) offerings you’d get with a $500 headset + (supply your own. $3500) PC. But you don’t need those. The Quest itself is a fully functional computer on its own and authors are writing heavily optimized games to accommodate the limited graphic processor abilities. This is easily made up for in the build quality, IPS display technology, and novel hand controllers -the same ones you find on other high end systems. The results are a portable, all in one, compact, well built game machine that requires no other accessors/configuration/or lengthy setup (with other VR systems you have to setup a room and/or wire cameras and devices -not so with the Quest). Hours of fun with little to no effort.

My friend has an older VR system - you must have a pretty good graphics card, the cables to the system, the towers and I have hit things while playing.  It is nice, but the setup seems finicky.  The Quest is well thought out and it is nice to play with no cords.I love the Guardian system (their system to define a ""safe"" play area).  It will show you a virtual wall grid if your arms start to move out of the safe area and how the system fades to the cameras as you start to step out of the defined play area.So far, I have played Angry Birds and Star Wars Vader Immortal and they are both lots of fun.  I am really happy with the purchase and I hope Oculus does really well this holiday season.The game selection is still pretty limited, but they are releasing the Oculus Link Headset Cable which will allow you to play games compatible with the Oculus Rift via a PC if you have an adequate graphics card.I hope this review is helpful.

An update. It has been nearly a month and Oculus is still dragging feet on my replacement controller thier customer service team seems to think copied and pasted apologies will make things right. It doesnt.There are many good things about this device. When it is working well it is spectacular. It also allows a midway glimps into the world of pc vr. Its performance is quite satisfactory in cross platform titles as well. So you must be wondering why 2 stars. I owned my Unit for 5 days and then my Right hand controller stopped functioning. I contacted customer support and did my walk through all of the trouble shoots to the product: no luck. Naturally I requested a replacement. They collected my information, I supplied it fast and properly. So can you tell me why it requires 3 to 5 days to tell me if I am getting a replacement? I work in a service field that offers tech support. If something is broken and we cant fix it over the phone, we ship a replacement out within the day. Granted I didn't ask for that, my real problem is that they gave me a very dubious answer instead of just telling me they need to verify and get approvals. It feels like customer service urgency is lacking with their team. That and I hate that Zuccerburg gets to profit off of my VR obsession.

By far the best and easiest way to get into VR. The fact that it’s self contained and wireless makes it a breeze to take to work/friends’ places. The audio is incredible too. The clarity varies based on user eye health, but for me it is decent. God rays and screen door are still present but my eyes adjust to them after a few minutes. The controllers are perfect and if you don’t buy Beat Saber and Vader are you even doing it right...?Casting to the phone is a great feature but it’s a bummer that it doesn’t support sound casting to phones.If you’re castjngbti a chromecast make sure you get the “Ultra 4K” version and that it and your headset are connected to a 5g internet network.

VR is pretty cool.  And the go is an awesome way to experience it.  But it seems to be pretty poorly built.  I have had mine for just over a month. 3 days past the return window. And the left controller fails  consistently.  I can’t play beat saber with it - can’t do anything with it without the left controller just disappearing. Sometimes I get a message that it can’t locate the left controller.  And there is no help. The oculus website is full of canned Q and As and there is no help. A deeper dig into the internet uncovers numerous complaints about a controller that just fails for no reason. And the only support offered is ‘replace the batteries’. Well I did. And it was no help.  So. Buy it if you really want to, but know you are risking buying a lemon.  Too bad, could have been pretty awesome.

I bought this in Sep 2019 and so far it has been a great decision. I got the 128 version because you can never have enough space and you can't upgrade later. I love the games (I actually like quite a few of the Beat Saber songs!) and they have new ones coming out rapidly which is great. I added a small batter pack to back to balance out the weight and now I can play for hours with no pain. I also got the thicker leather face cushion which makes a big difference too. One of the funnest things about this is showing your friends. We have had VR parties and watching people trying to walk ""Richies Plank"" or do Super Hot VR is so much fun. Most of the games are very reasonable and the graphics are great. So far I have really enjoyed owning this and would recommend it highly.

I've been waiting for ""virtual reality"" since i was a kid. And after my 8-bit Nintendo gave way to the 16-bit era (and sega's Genesis vs the Snes) that was the VERY first time I can remember seeing articles about virtual reality systems and imagining what this experience could be like... But when?? And Mind you- we hadnt even seen Mario 64 yet, let alone a  PlayStation or an X Box... So im talking about the early/mid '90's at this point, and The technology was still a ways off--still in developmental stages and just beginning to be explored, and the surface just being scratched on how it could realistically be brought to the masses... While remaining affordable too.And so Like everyone else, I waited. And waited. And then waited some more. And it would take around 20 years before i could finally say that the future was finally here!!Attention gamers (or just anybody who's curious about the ""self-immersive"" game experience), the time for waiting had finally come to an end. The future was here!!My first experience with the Oculus quest was using one that a friend of mine had gotten around time of the quest's initial release (post Rift, and Rift-S). And when he brought it over and let me play with it that first time, I was immediately blown away!! The execution and the overall experience of the headset was jaw-droppingly incredible. with the headset on i was finally transported to a new digital construct... I was IN the game. I was finally living out something i had dreamed about since i was a teenager. And what helps differentiate the quest from other VR headsets is that it's wireless!! No being tethered to a power source by cables or wires. And the full 360° interactive field of vision is something that you must experience in order to fully appreciate and see wh a t it is like... Words may do a fair job at describing it, but being able to visualize it; seeing it with your own two eyes is the only way that you can truly do it the service that it deserves. Since the technology entails manipulating sight and vision of the user, it is thee only way to understand what this experience truly feels like.The quest is a breakthrough achievement. Hands down! And for around $550 (tax included for the larger memory 128 gb version. There are 2--the other a 64 gb at $400), I think it's relatively inexpensive given the price tags for their rival competitor's headsets, and simply for the All-around quality that you get. The setup and interface is really straight forward. And with a ""digital store"" at your disposal you can get games instantly downloaded and that for the most part range from $15-30. When compared to the prices of console games, these are less than half of those. I can't rave enough about my purchase and how impressed i am with the entire machine.I will say this: you're gonna have to (or 'should', anyway) spend another 200 bucks for done essential accessories--including a few games, some valuable add-ons i think you should purchase are: a display stand, a head pad to improve the comfort of the headset while you wear it- which does feel a little lacking in that department but v that's probably my biggest criticism. Some controller grips that help with the handling of them,vand perhaps MOST important of all--invest 15-20 bucks for a rechargeable double A battery charger. This is really (besides the game and the head pad) thee only real ""must buy"" bc the batteries do drain on the faster side--lasting only a couple weeks before with the 2 battsthat are included).But, if you're scrolling thru these reviews bc you're still on the fence and ""unsure"" and want to see what people are saying--please take it from me. This new virtual experience is the best thing since Mario. But I get it-- I'd do the same;) But, honestly-- get this! You will not regret it! And that's a promise I make with the utmost  of confidence.And in case you're thinking this review is just ""too darn good"" well I want to go on record and officially say that I'm not a ""plant"" or some phony reviewer either--I have no affiliation with oculus or the company what so ever:) I'm just a 40-year-old dude who had been dreaming of the day that virtual reality would finally arrive and be good enough and affordable enough to lay down some money for and being into your home. I haven't been playing my other consoles as much bc ive been so sucked into this, I almost feel bad... But notice i said almost lol. When you're having this much fun you shouldn't feel guilty about a thing;)I'm truly happy to be writing such a favorable/positive review for something that ive been waiting so long to experience;) It's like I said-- the future is here! You're not just playing games anymore...You are IN the game now. IN IT. It really feels like you're there! I'm not kidding-when you try it you will see what im saying; A purchase you will not regret!As for the library and having variety-- as you can imagine there are many first person shooter types that take advantage of the hardware, but the ones that I've played are excellent. But beyond that I There are games where you can climb, fly, fight. There's a little bit of everything. And You can get a real workout playing some of them--and actually sweat from the activity that can be involved--No joke. ""Racket NX"" is probably my favorite ""sports game"" (a futuristic tennis/racketball hybrid). Also, ""drop dead"" and ""robo recall"" are great first-person shooters that I'd recommend be in anyll quest owner's gaming library. And ""Moss"" is an incredible adventure game that is kinda in the vain of Zelda, but instead of Link you control a cutearmor-wearing mouse with a sword. It was actually my VERY first game purchase, and it's a game unlike any other in that it combines first and third person perspective, based on this accomplishment I can't wait to see what the developers do next bc i think it's a remarkable achievement:) and if a few days ago, ""Vacation simulator"" was my most recent purchase (i probably have bought 8 games)b and if full of mini games and lots to tackle to keep you playing for hours on end. Plus there are a lot of demos and free games... Vader Immortal: episodes1-3 came as a free bundle, but I'm not sure if that was just a limited time promo??But the feeling of finally wielding a light saber and to hear it's energy swirl around you as you swing it was a highlight that makes me giddy again just thinking about it...But standing face to face with the dark lord himself was as much treat as it was frightening. Unfortunately it's a quick experience which can be completed in a total of  3-4 hours but each episode has as mini lightsaber have that had some replay value. And just may be the best part besides the new content that you're seeing unfold in the story-mode of the game itself.The only ""negative"" (and i use that very loosely since it's really more of a minor ""warning"" than a legit pro/con point), is that some may take need a little ""adjustment period""... Or just some time to get acclimated and/or accustomed to what it's like to experience VR in general, and the foreignness of the full sensory engagement that VR undoubtedly is at it's core. That being said, it's not uncommon to feel a little motion sickness when you first play... but there are a couple ways that this effect can be reduced in the settings-- by changing each individual game's modes of ""transport"" (or getting around) to ""teleporting"" as opposed to ""walking"". And also, changing your ""guardian's boundaries"" that you set each time you turn on your quest-- ""stationary mode"" has less locomotion (since you're usually seated), whereas setting the guardian to a ""roomscale mode"" allows for a more liberating and freely moving experience... And add you might think--you may experience some motion sickness, but for me it was just in the first couple days off using it and not i can't recall the last time I've felt even the slightest bit ""off or nauceous"". Honest.But it really just boils down to individual sensitivity and familiarizing yourself with this, then the less likely you will feel it. Just remember, those who have any concerns about this should know that it can always be adjusted:) which brings me to my last ""easing"" of your mind, if that's what you're looking for in this review... Those fearing that they may ""walk into something, or break something while playing--the ""guardian"" (which i mentioned earlier) defines the ""playing area"" that you will be using, And if you get close to  the edge of that ""invisibly digitally drawn and designed game zone- you will be alerted with vibration, and the headset also switching out of the ""game's headset view"" to a view of your ""actual real world surroundings"" by way be if the 4 cameras on the four corners on the front of your headset.And for those that are hesitant still bc of the price, know this: I got my Oculus using the no-interest-payment plan over 12-months that's specifically offered using the Chase Amazon credit card. This is basically 0 percent financing for purchases you decide and im literally paying only $41 a month fl over 12 months for mine. I think it's beautiful! ;) And I'll say it again-- At 0 (zer0) interest. Not a single penny.Anyhow, I could write on and on about how pleased and full of joy ive been with my Oculus purchase. I really do love it!So, trust me-- If you've been thinking about getting one, just do yourself a favor and stop waiting;)I would think it nearly impossible for anyone (even seniors bc you can just toggle and adjust the settings to help cater certain effects to the user. And remember- the VR experience isn't only about ""games"". There's apps for travel and entertainment too, and you can even watch TV and movie on it like your ""prime video"" or your ""Netflix"", Making it useful and fun for people of all ages!Oh, and i almost forgot--the fact that you have ""hands"" in these games and experiences now is what also takes it to a whole other level. That's what the controllers are for--They give you ""virtual hands"". What a trip it is!! Anyway- Take my word for it and don't wait any longer-- get yourself one of these today! I promise- you will not be disappointed! I can't imagine how anyone could be, with the Oculus quest!For the future is here people!And all u need to jump in is a wifi connection!Now, Have some fun! Bc I guarantee you will from the moment you don it for the very first time:)

It's great and amazing, really. It's just ridiculous how a product this advanced fails badly on something so trivial. The headset is too heavy. Not to cause me back aches, but to stay corrected on my head.When wearing it, it keeps on falling down, the straps are too smooth. The internet is full of people adding power banks on the back to keep it adjusted, but it surprises me people are fine with that solution. I'm not into adding more weight, the product should be delivered fully prepared.If I had known it beforehand I wouldn't have ordered it, simply because of it. Sadly i can't return it because I bought it internationally.Again, as a vr headset it's amazing, so advanced, more and more apps and support, but I can't fit it without tucking something to keep it tight...

I am not a game player.  I'm a little old lady.  But the games (Beat Saber) are pretty compelling with this technology.  Moving on from the fun stuff, I was really impressed with the ability to revisit trails that I have hiked in Glacier NP, Iceland and other locations via ""Wander"".  The detail and feeling that you are RIGHT THERE, is amazing.  I hated the roller coaster program--real roller coaster don't make me queasy, but this did.  My son introduced me to VR with his whole room, cameras on the wall, high end computer setup.  This device does everything his does in one headset at 10% of the cost and about the 95% performance level.  Which is better than excellent if not quite awesome.  The technology has huge potential for the elderly or bedridden, for simulations (pilot, cars, etc), for education, etc.

I just received my Oculus Quest two days ago and I really love the immersive, cable-free VR experience it provides, but after setup I found my unit had a bad or stuck pixel on the far right of the left lens. This means it shows up near the center of the wearers view.  After some research it seems this is a common complaint, but honestly I didn't really expect to have to immediately return a $500 device manufactured by a multi-billion dollar technology company.

I'll update this review with more details at a later date. I'll make a comparison to the Oculus Rift at the end for those who have one and want some point of reference.Here's the quick and dirty of it:Fantastic product for a mobile device.The headset tracking is spot on. Controller tracking is good enough for even pickier users, but should feel great for everyone else.Audio seems like TV speaker quality, but if it were in a surround sound setup; amazing sense of direction, but low quality sound. Volume levels are good.Display is clear and crisp.I did have a few minor issues with controller tracking so far. Guardian boundaries (what prevents you from hitting a wall, etc.) are a little too sensitive, so it's always popping up. A few minor visual glitches seem to occur in the form of tiny white, sometimes colored, lines appearing. The static foveated rendering technique (lower rendered resolution near the edges of your view) used in some experiences (i.e. Vader Immorta) can be a bit distracting at times. This is all really minor stuff though, and shouldn't take away from the experience at all.Overall an amazing device for VR on the go or even just something light weight for home use.For those who have or have tried an Oculus Rift and want a point of comparison:Compared to my 3 sensor Oculus Rift, the Quest has its pros and cons. The Quest controller tracking definitely leaves a bit to be desired. The default Quest audio quality is definitely a major step down. Resolution is a definite step up, but I still get some god rays and screen door effect. No sensor setup can be a major plus for many users, but I personally never minded it (the Rift sensors setup just like my surround sound speakers, so it wasn't much of an issue). The Quest is a great secondary device for current Rift users or as a PC VR alternative if you want a bit lighter weight solution.

Seriously I bought this to play beat saber in an attempt to slim down!Boy I wasn't disappointed - in 26 days - coupled with some strict diet - I lost 8 Kgs...And I don't get bored playing it - I must say it exceeds my expectations...I used to get bored exercising, but with beat saber, the motivation is renewed every day - gotta make a better score!The immersion experience is fabulous - I've tried other games and it simply fascinating!Been wanting to get a VR headset for more than a year - but couldn't afford one - specially considering that you'd need a powerful PC to connect it to... but not with the Quest, no! It's an all in one device - No wires... and if you follow Tyco Tech's channel on YouTube - you can tweak it to get the best out of it - cast to your Laptop with no chromecast or additional material - sideload other games that were not meant for the Quest with SideQuest - He explains everything in detail for free...So like I said, you won't regret it...The only down point is that the foam that comes with it that's in contact with your face starts stinking after about a month - since if you play vividly like me, you will sweat - and it absorbs the sweat- fortunately there's plenty of replacements for that on the net... again - check out Tyco Tech's channel on YouTube and he's gonna be super helpful!Cheers,Reuben

I bought the $500 one with the extra storage, which i don't need since there arent that many games available. VERY fun, love the convenience of it ( no wires, can take it anywhere) and the graphics weren't too bad considering its working off an android processor. The headset is not comfortable and really heavy, you can't wear it for more than an hour without having to take it off. The games are usually from $10 - $30, but i still think thats pricy since the games can be beat within a couple hours and aren't all that fun to replay.

My son asked for this for Christmas. He found out this year that I was actually Santa Claus so I felt a little pressure there. He already has a strong and perhaps unhealthy affinity for his electronics and, when given the choice, would rather play with those than do other kid stuff such as bike-riding, playing with friends (offline), etc. As parents we were at a a cross-roads: do we interfere and start the electronics withdrawal process or do we just let it go. I think we chose to just let it go and the Oculus is just the exclamation point on that decision.

Its cheap, considering its an All-In-One, its easy to use, and gives you an amazing first hand experience for VRPLUS it doubles as a PCVR headset when you plug it into a PC!

My niece came to visit and wanted to log in to her account on my Quest. We spent an hour trying to find the ""log out"" button on the Quest. Of course, this isn't possible. If you want to sign into another account, they force you to erase all data and factory reset the device. Absurd! Why?

Edit: while I enjoyed the Quest I can’t get over the technical issues I encountered. My left speaker blew and after reaching out to support they only had a factory reset as a solution. My charging cable died less than a week after receiving it. I had to pull the usb-c from my Mac to power the headset. Along with constant game crashing, hand tracking issues, and guardian system problems just made it easier for me to return for now. Don’t get my wrong I loved it and might purchase in the future or after they patch some of the necessary improvements. But for now, just 4 stars.Easy to set up and use! I gotta say for it being the first generation of travel VR it does the job. The battery doesn’t last as long as one would hope for long gaming periods but it comes with a mighty long charging cable.

Let me preface this review by saying that I've been into video games for over ten years now. PC and Xbox primarily, but my mind is open to any type of game out there. So when the idea of virtual reality came to be and companies like Oculus were trying to bring this experience to the every day user, I was very skeptical. Could such an experience really be brought into a regular person's home, and be intuitive enough that anyone could pick it up? The short answer is yes, but with some factors to consider before going all crazy over having VR at your fingertips. There is a acclimation period where you have to get used to using the Quest; when putting the headset on and playing your first few games, motion sickness will definitely kick in and it is definitely a feeling unlike any other. I couldn't play for too long my first few times due to this. The games available thus far, although I didn't expect much, I could see myself getting bored of after a few months or so. I would think of the Quest as more of a novelty item than anything; awesome fun to have for the beginning period of having it, but I think it will tire out quickly as it has on me after a week. Great quality headset, but mroe development needs to be made on the VR gaming side before I really get behind it.

This was my first experience with VR. Been wireless is truly a game changer. The graphics are pretty good, especially given the processor. The UI is very intuitive. If you're new to VR, there's the aspect of motion sickness you have to get used to but after a couple days, it's one of the most addictive devices out there. Besides games, the interesting apps that alone would justify the purchase include the Quest implementation of Google Maps streetview. Such fun! I would highly recommend the Quest to anyone.

I switched from the PS4 VR to the Oculus Quest and would recommend it for anyone. The number of titles (games) is still a bit limited but growing everyday. The accuracy of the controllers is far better that the camera tracker with the PS4 and not having all of the cables makes for a great gaming experience. Battery life is about 3 hours on a charge but we don’t play more than three hours in a sitting so the point is moot. I’ve read some feedback of people saying the headset is heavy but if you are not a newborn baby you probably won’t have any issues holding your head up. I don’t wear glasses when I play so I can’t speak to comfort when wearing glasses but overall it’s a comfortable fit.

I've had Oculus Go for a while, and so didn't strictly need a Quest, but I had work and personal reasons to want to check it out. I suspect that if you're reading this you're deciding whether to get Go or Quest. Here are some things better on Go than Quest:Many more apps.You can rent videos, including 3D movies. Though not enough of those.It is a good amount cheaper.Things that are better on Quest than Go:6DOF. The Quest can scan your room as a way to tell where you have moved to. Some other PC based headsets need transmitters placed in your room, to detect where you are. Quest reads your room, and you can walk around as part of the game play. It is done in a very neat way, and for apps such as the Anne Frank virtual tour, available on both headsets, being able to walk around and lean over to see a different view adds a lot.Less steaming up. The Go lenses cloud up very quickly. That happens less with Quest.Two controllers. Perhaps 90% of the time, one controller would work well, but for shoot 'em up games, two guns is better. Some games make good use of two controllers to manipulate things.Auto power off. To be fair, I need to fire up my Go and see it this feature got added. A recent feature in Quest is that you can set it to turn on when you pick it up, and turn off when you haven't touched it for 15 seconds. That's how I work with it, and the battery can last a couple of days between uses.Resolution. This is a minor step up from the detail in Go, but at the borderline of what makes it be seamless. With Go it's perfectly good enough if you're engrossed, but you see pixels easily if you look for them. With Quest you need to be looking for pixels. If you are, you see them. So stop looking for them!Short version of all that, Go is great, you will love it. Quest is better, other than the lack of movie rentals and number of apps. If you're not considering the price as much as the features, I would choose Quest, and hope that the number of apps and videos increases.

I've never used a VR headset before the quest. I had seen a few youtube videos and thought it looked fun, but never had a gaming PC. When I saw the quest was stand-alone I figured this was my chance and was pretty excited to finally try VR out. Turns out I had no idea what VR was really like. All the youtube videos didn't even come close to doing this thing justice. I have been utterly blown away by how amazing an experience it is to play a game on the Quest. Using the quest I never forget I'm in a game, but I absolutely forget I'm in my living room. Having this things be stand-alone and wireless really helps too. The setup was trivial, and the games (superhot, I expect you to die, journey of the gods) are so much fun. I know the graphics aren't as good as PCVR, but that was never an option for me and I haven't felt let down by the graphics yet.

Was going to buy a VR headset this year no matter what , even with my annoyance of its limitations. I was going towards Valve Index and didn't really even have the quest on my radar. As I researched more, they came out with the PC link for the Quest , so now you got the best of both worlds and I pulled the trigger quick. Legit go anywhere VR, I was actually doing in my backyard at night! I am totally on-board with this Headset, PClink, Hand tracking, voice command, and more to come I am sure. Sure does the Index give you the most fidelity PC experience? probably so, but PC link is just in beta and it just works, I am sure its going to get better and better. I was glad I pulled the trigger right at the edge of being able to get one. I'm ALL IN. I consider the Quest as the game changer, it removes a huge portion of the limitations of VR, right out of the gate.

Just do some YouTube research and you can use this as a pcvr system either wirelessly through your WiFi or with the Oculus link cable.  The only VR u can take anywhere.  I play in my garage and I'll tell u playing super hot while u walk around a big play area is so cool.

In love with this. I rented the Rift once and for hooked. I decided to buy this one since the Rift needs a rather powerful computer.This one is a stand-alone that is really something else. I haven't played that much, but I have been watching videos. Many of them are free, and you can spend a lot of time exploring without paying more for games or experiences.

Really like the way the game actually makes you feel immersed in the game. Handsets are much better than expected. People of all ages among our family and friends have enjoyed it. Even fun to watch other people play it when you cast the game to a TV. Downfalls are field of vision maybe not as good as it can be, and necessity to buy a separate “face cover” for the headset to make it easier to clean (some games make the player quite sweaty) and fit more snugly. Overall, very pleased with the Oculus. Great activity when family and friends over, or to take other places!

This is not a perfect VR experience, but for the money, this is more than you might expect.Let's talk about the bad first.VR inherently has some issues. The biggest is that you're strapping a computer to your face, and your face wasn't designed (or evolved) for that. Because of that, my forehead was feeling a bit of a pressure headache after about an hour and a half of play. However, that is a problem you're going to see on every VR headset, and is in no way unique to the Quest.The other big problem with VR, is most people don't have an open space in their house/apartment big enough for VR, so you're going to have to move some furniture. This may not be a big deal for some, but I was surprised on just how much room you really need for VR. I moved all the furniture out of an 8x10 area, and I was still running into the boundaries every now and again.Let's talk about the awesome.The hand presence is incredible. It's not just hand presence, it's finger presence. The controllers are sensitive enough to feel when your fingers have just grazed the buttons or triggers, and show your fingers, in game, to match to that. It's so impressive that you really lose yourself in the world. There is something magical about that moment because everything just intuitively makes sense. It's so much fun.The tracking is way better than it should be. There are no external trackers like you would see with the Oculus Rift, or VTC Vive. All the tracking is done with the four front-facing cameras. So you would think that as soon as you hand goes out of view of those cameras it would lose it, but it doesn't. When playing games like Robo Recall, where you grab guns by reaching behind you (outride of the view of the cameras) the Quest flawlessly knows what you're doing.Speaking of those front-facing cameras, the guardian system is excellent. You can redraw your play space anywhere, but better than that, when you move beyond your place space you see a black and white version of the world. This has already been helpful when I need to just quickly grab my phone from the other room. I just exit the guardian boundary and I can walk around as if I wasn't wearing the headset. This may also be useful if you want to go from room-scale play to sitting down to watch a movie or Netflix. You can navigate to the couch and resume, all without taking off the headset.The best part of the Quest though is the price. This is an incredible level of VR all without buying an expensive PC. I am blown away.

I'm blown away with the accuracy and can't wait for more games to be released. I say screw the haters and get you one!

So I've been wanting a VR headset for years but was never in a position to be able to afford one. Then came the Quest. This headset appealed to me for so many reasons. It's wireless and doesn't require any outside tracking. You draw a space on the floor of the room you are playing in and that becomes your play space. This system is called Guardian and it works really well. It's price point was also a huge driver for me, compared to other headsets.So onto the features of this headset. The audio from the built in speaks is good but not amazing (I bought ear buds). The basic facial interface is fine but made of a soft fabric that will absorb sweat and get a bit funky. There are lots of third party facial interfaces for fairly cheap. The controller tracking and motion tracking is very good, only time I've lost tracking was when I was playing in very low light. I will say this headset is a bit heavy and after extended play can leave your cheeks a bit sore. Again there are a lot of third party solutions for this that are very inexpensive.One of my biggest hesitations was because this runs on an app store so you can't just play your PC based games on it. Oculus has made that a non-issue with Quest Link which allows you to turn the Quest into a PC wired headset. This requires a bit of work but it will allow you to play Steam VR titles. I will say that the native app store library is very solid and I've had an absolute blast playing these games. They are also adding new titles constantly.So all that to say if you want an affordable, solid, entry-level headset to get into VR, you can't beat the Quest. I love mine and it has made me a believer that this is a technology on the verge of becoming much more common in the average household. I hope this helps you make your decision.

Wireless Inside Out Tracking VR

2022-05-22 13:20:24.625588,"
I would like to say that I have thoroughly enjoyed owning the Oculus Quest.  I have always had an interest in technology and the direction that tech is heading, in particular virtual and augmented reality.  To be quite honest though, I really didn’t know too much about VR headsets or their capabilities.  One day, I was watching YouTube and a gentleman was doing a unboxing video on the Quest.  I found the video he did very interesting, and started researching VR and the Quest.  The first thing that caught my attention was the price point on some of the other headsets.  There was no way I would pay the expensive price point for what I thought was a game platform with no other functions.  When I researched the Quest I saw that THEIR price point was affordable compared to some of the others I had researched.  I struggled with one thing though, whether to purchase the 64g or the 128g version.  The 100 dollar difference was a concern, and I hesitated making the purchase.  I finally decided on getting the 128 version.  My reasoning was you never know what updates or changes that might take place in the future, and I wanted my headset to have the storage capacity to adapt to whatever might come down the road (something to think about).  Another thing that made me buy quest:  One thing another gentleman said in his video was how when he put on his Quest for the first time how it “changed his life”.  I had never seen virtual reality outside a movie theatre, so I wanted to experience what this man had experienced.  I have to say, that when I first put the headset on and the very first images were in front of my eyes, IT CHANGED MY LIFE and perceptions of the real world.  It really was a mind blowing experience.  The freedom of movement without wires and to be able to reach out and “touch” things in VR was just a wonderful experience.  For me, the only two issues that I have had with Quest are that one, after maybe 30 minutes to a hour of wearing Quest it starts to hurt my head, and I have to take it off.  It is front heavy so comfort for me isn’t the greatest, but their are aftermarket things you can purchase to help with that problem, such as a counterweight that helps balance it on your head.  The second issue is that the batteries in the hand controllers are exhausted very quickly.  So before you purchase Quest, be prepared to buy a lot of batteries.  I would recommend getting rechargeable batteries or buy batteries in bulk.  The simple solution to this problem for me was to simply take the batteries out of the controllers when I’m not using Quest.  It might be a hassle fore some people but for me it has really helped me maintain battery life, just a thought.  If not for these two issues I would give Quest 5 stars but I believe 4 stars is valid.  If you are really interested in VR and don’t want to spend over a thousand dollars for VR then I would highly recommend the Quest.  The content of different things you can do on it is sufficient, and only getting better, and quite a few games offer a demo version so you can experience the game before purchase.  Do your research, and be sure you want to spend the 4 to 5 hundred dollars.  In the real world that’s still a lot of money, so make sure you aren’t purchasing something that is going to sit in the bottom of the closet after spending so much money.  I use mine every single day so it has been a fair purchase for me.  One last thing, I would highly recommend purchasing a case to protect your investment.  It’s way too much money not to protect your investment.  I also recommend sleeves to protect your controllers from wear and tear.  Oculus has even updated quest where you can use your own hands instead of controllers.  It’s in the infancy stages but I can foresee in the future that the controllers will be obsolete.  In closing, I believe that if you decide to purchase the Oculus Quest you will have a highly enjoyable experience.  Meeting people from all over the world and the 360 experience gaming and video content is a GAS.  I’m a NBA fan and sitting court side watching the best basketball players in the world in the comfort of your own home is an amazing experience.  Something in real life I never will have the chance of experiencing.  Good luck and enjoy your experience if you purchase the Oculus QUEST.  I really am enjoying mine and I’m glad I brought it.

Something about the lack of wires seems to make all the difference to me. This is far more immersive than even the best desktop systems, IMO. I was a little skeptical at first because there weren't as many apps in the store. That seems not to be a big issue, and more are coming every day. I've been very happy with the battery life. I've had it in use for a couple hours at a time (handing it off between people), and had no problems. The comfort is good, although it is a little front-heavy. A friend of mine mounted a battery on the back strap, which extends battery life AND seems to balance it even better on the head. One accessory I recommend is googly eyes. Very entertaining for any spectators waiting for a turn!

The free Within app provides high-quality HD videos where you can take a tour of the White House with the Obamas, climb a New York City Bridge with the NYPD Rescue Team, go for a spacewalk, and so much more! With other free apps I attended a live Tenacious D concert (Oculus Venues), took a tour of the Anne Frank House, watched Amazon Prime and YouTube videos (on a sixty foot screen!), and flew to the moon (Apollo 11 Quest). Other free apps include Bait (fishing), BOGO (virtual pet), Epic Roller Coasters, and much more!

My three favorite games for sweat-inducing exercise are Pistol Whip, Racket NX, and Beat Saber (check out the loads of fun folks are having on YouTube with these great games - and the three boxing apps). My other favorite games are Vader Immortal, Racket Fury: Table Tennis, Moss, Superhot VR, Robo Recall: Unplugged, Red Matter, and Space Pirate Trainer.

I had the Oculus DK2, the Rift, the Go, and the PSVR. If your new to owning a VR headset, this is the best choice out there. It may not have the graphical prowess of the Rift or PSVR, but the better lens and resolution surely makes up for it. Despite the graphical cutbacks with its games, the immersion is definitely there. Soundwise; the onboard speakers are better than the Oculus Go with better low end.This VR headsets best asset is that it is untethered to a console or PC. With its 6 DOF you can move around the virtual space as much as the real physical room allows you. You nolonger need to keep in mind if you're within the bounds of your external trackers.

We had the chance for about a month to play on Oculus Rifts at a local arcade before it closed. We loved the experience of VR, but the need to maintain a full gaming computer (each), a dedicated space with cameras all over the room, and all of the setup and maintenance we saw behind the scenes at the arcade meant it was out of reach at home. No more! The Quest has a limited selection of games for now (still more than other consoles at launch!), but the VR experience is every bit as amazing and immersive as I remember.

I have the Oculus Go and side-by-side there is a weight difference. I can use my Go for the whole battery life, but the Quest is uncomfortable within minutes. It has a spring like band that tightens up as you move, which makes it tighter as you play. The weight causes the hardware to pull down with gravity and digs in your cheeks. I've been debating on returning do to this, but it is such a nice upgrade. My hope is that a separate cushion insert will be available to relieve this discomfort. Until then, I'm considering making a cushion myself. This is a huge issue with this device.

I also own an HTC Vive Pro, so my review will be in light of that context.The good:1. Super easy setup2. Visuals are good3. Controllers allow you to control individual fingers in VR, which can be useful for some apps/games. Looks like an interesting development over previous VR generation controllers.4. No lighthouses needed.Cons:1. The weight is very forward making it create some fatigue on the head. Can only play around 30m before it becomes painful to wear. This could possibly be mitigated by putting some sort of cloth between your head and the straps, such as a winter hat.2. The controllers' battery covers slide off too easily. This is especially annoying during more intense games, like Beat Saber, where you are needing to move the controllers quickly. I purchased some silicone covers which resolved this issue mostly.Word to the wise, when you set up boundaries, have the lights on. And always turn on the lights when you intend to play. The tracking relies heavily on visual, and shutting off the lights in the room changes that completely, making the system unable to recognize the environment.

Holy crap this thing is AMAZING!! My husband wanted to buy this for our son and I was a little hesitant about it. I mean, we've  had VRs where you put your phone in and I was never that impressed. So I assumed this would be somewhat like that, but you know the saying about assuming.  This thing is legit! Nothing like any vr I've ever experienced before. My husband  pulled it out the night we got it to ensure everything was good and after seeing all the fun he was having I just had to try it out for myself. We played on it for a good hour before boxing it back up. I honestly can't wait to give it to our son, just so I can play with it and I'm far from a gamer. Trust me. You want this. It's pretty damn cool.

Incredible piece of equipment. Picks up your Wi-Fi signal in the house so you can purchase apps and games. Once they are loaded you can disconnect from the internet/Wi-Fi signal and take your headset anywhere(including locations with zero internet) to play. Everything is stored and played wirelessly in the headset. Games and apps are unbeleivable6and breathtaking, even frightening at times. Haven't regretted a single second of this purchase. Wife loves it as well. Exercise (such as boxing through with Thrill of the Fight) is intense...and very real. 5 stars all the way for this equipment.

Oculus Quest finally brings together all the promises that VR has hinted at over the last couple of years. As it is completely wireless standalone, the sense of freedom is massive. Visuals, sound, controls and overall feel really is good enough to convince your senses to a very close degree, that you’re in another world. The launch apps are over expectations high quality with everything from an intricate story driven star wars game, to expansive nature experiences and action shooting. Even Netflix is surprisingly immersive and a better viewing experience than any other mobile platform. Especially since you won’t be distracted once your in the cozy living room of VR. Highly recommend this as a leap in to VR. It’s here! Get it!

Awesome VR headset. This is my first official VR and I love it! The only issue I have is it was hard trying to find a sweet spot for ybr best view because it's so front heavy. The counter weight you see in the picture helped alot. Found some workout sandbags for 6 bucks at Walmart that to improve the weight. I'm sure facebook knew this would be a issue but they released it anyways without creating a counter weight. Love the headset but for the price, if you spend over 200 dollars on anything but you need to find ways to make it comfortable for you to use it, they need to lower the price.

Love the Oculus Quest. If you don't have a computer that can handle VR and you don't want to spend the money to buy one this is the perfect buy. You don't have to use a computer to play. I originally bought this for me because I'm a gamer but my kids have used it more than me. To the point that I have had to set game time rules. Even my 7 year old loves it. My 14 year old son always challenges me on who can do the best on a game. We also love how you can stream to the tv to see what the person who is playing sees. It has some good games. I just hope they bring on a ton more. I plan to get my money's worth out of this.

I went back and forth on whether to get the 64gig or the 128gig for a few months then pulled the trigger on the 128gig since I had some Amazon gift cards saved up. I am glad I did since I use it a lot and would rather not have to delete things to make room for others; not sure I will ever fill it unless I start loading movies or something large on it because the games are not really that big. Still glad I got the 128gig. I can't get the casting feature to work yet, but that is most likely on my end not the Quest.

setup :when i got it the setup was very fast but i had a problem connecting the headset to my phone.motion sickness: there is barely any motion sickness.the problem with the tracking: i had issues with the tracking i mostly played beat saber with the oculus link using a PC and 2 cables that i got with my phone (one of them broke with in 3 days) the tracking was good when you play hard and some expert song but almost always when you play songs on expert and expert+ and tracking become pretty bad normally when the controllers are pointing to the front it point them to the back and sometime it will take up to 5 second until it will track them when the controllers are coming out of the cameras view which makes it that i can't play most of the expert and expert+ songsthe problem with the link: i used 2 cable that i used for charging my phone and the cables broke very fast the first that i didn't use at all 1 broke with in 3 days and the second cable broke after a week when i tried to reduce moving it.would i recommend this headset yes and no i wouldn't recommend the 128 GB because i dont think you would need the 128 GB but the 64 GB would be a better idea and it will save you money and if you have a PC that can run vr you can use almost any cable to play your games with it but if you are going to play mostly beat saber i would recommend you to get the rift s i haven't tried it yet but i heard that most of the problem that i had playing beat saber are less common

Normally I not an early adopter for any technology with only a couple of exceptions (Roku being the last one).  Since the Oculus Rift existed for a while with pretty good reviews and as I watched some videos of the Oculus Quest, I decided to jump on the chance to get this device on release date.I was not disappointed.  While the library was small at the time, Beat Saber became an instant favorite.  Shortly after, I have learned of way to sideload new songs as well as software that is not available in the Oculus Store which has expanded its use tremendously.  If I had a higher end computer, I would also be streaming titles from my Steam Library as well.The build quality is great and the only minor gripe is the foam padding for your face.  For extraneous games which get you sweating, the foam padding just soaks it all in which is not great if you want to share the device.  So now I have resorted to wearing a headband and face mask to help with that until my order for a new cover from vrcover.com arrives.Overall this is an amazing product.

80 hours of gaming later. Wait I can lose weight and play videos games now? The videos online don’t do justice to this thing. Battery life got down to 64% with 2.5 hours of gameplay. Even then it’s tiring. I don’t care to own a PC. So I’ll never get any VR system that’s not standalone. This thing packs enough power to make the experiences worth while. Yeah it doesn’t have Xbox One X graphics but the high frame rate fluidity of each experience makes up for all that. I cannot wait for a call of duty title type game to come out. Also if you are huge fan of Zelda, there’s a clone game that is everything you’d expect from a Zelda game. Worth every penny!

I love this headset. It's my second VR headset with having a Google Dream prior to this. The Google headset is no comparison to this. The battery life isn't what I'd like but I use it almost daily. I went with the larger memory size so that I wouldn't have to uninstall games/apps as new ones become available. Other than the lack of many games at launch and the battery life, I'm very happy with my Oculus Quest VR headset. I've gotten others saving their money to buy their own.

So far I have been enjoying this. Bit of a pain to get the headset setup so that it isnt blurry with the straps.One of the biggest cons that my girlfriend who has used this has is that it is fairly bulky/heavy. Other than that havent had too many issues. Fairly simple to setup.As a side note to close--you might want to prepare your wallet for all the games that you will likely end up getting for this thing assuming you don't have many on Steam that are VR friendly.

Bought the higher GB as you have to download games into the headset but the extra money is worth it!!Game play is EXTREMELY IMMERSIVE, there is a large range of genres and a ""screen mirroring"" feature is still in beta but will be amazing once finished. The headset is very heavy at first and I wouldn't encourage long spans of game play but you do get used to it. The until it's built solid, doesn't feel cheap in anyway and the controllers are very responsive.Only complaint is that it took almost five weeks for it to be delivered.

I tend to be very prone to motion sickness in VR and first-person games, but haven't had that issue so far with Oculus Quest. The ability to turn around in real life — without tripping over wires — eliminates the need for a software-based ""workaround"" such as using a thumbstick to turn your head in VR. This one difference removes a major source of queasiness for me.The more freedom you have to move around, the more convincing and comfortable VR is. I can't go back to anything else.

Firstly, I'll just go and state that everywhere it's being written about troubles with the cables. And this is all true. Purchased 5 different sets of cables for sidequesting and charging. Not a single one worked except the shortest cable that came with the set. Also had a problem with USB 3 as it would only work in a USB 2, even though all documentation says it works in 3.Secondly, slowly there has been a growing crack on the inside the left lens. Right one is perfectly fine, but the crack has slowly been growing after after 3 months making the left eye kinda blurry.Avoid this product and go with a Oculus 2 if you must go with that system, nothing but good reviews, even though it's still fairly new. Might as go with the Oculus 2 or a VIVE. and avoid  Oculus 1... even if it's cheaper as a returned/refurbed unit.

My 12 year old son has researched several VR systems and finally decided on the Oculus Quest for the following reasons:  Stand Alone System, price, reviews from his favorite YouTubers, and game availability.  He saved money for quite some time during his research.  He LOVES this system and I just had to try it out.  It is unbelievable!  At first I was a little disappointed that the graphics were ""cartoonish"", but once you are in the games, you get totally submersed in the action!  While we have only purchased 2 games, Job Simulator and Super Hot, there are plenty of demos that come with the Quest, my favorite being Beat Saber (next on our list to purchase the full game).

I bought this as the familygift for Christmas 2019.....The kids absolutely love it. Wife and I enjoy the games but it also makes watching TV, Movies, and other streaming services really fun. Prior to making the purchase I wasn't sure which memory size to get 64gb or 128gb, either is fine post purchase after downloading over 20 games and apps. Most files are a about 1gb or less with the some of the higher end graphic games coming in around 2gn to 2.5gb. Either memory will be fine if you will have a family of 4 or more might want to go to 128gb just in case.CON: Battery life is about 1.5hrs (not bad if you want to be able to limit the screen time haha) but this can be fixed with the battery pack extender for abiut $50 bucks. Which brings me to the only other con which is the weight of the googles smaller heads struggle with the weight HOWEVER if you have the battery pack on the back it balances out nicely.PROS: if it ain't listed in the cons section then it is good seriously.I bought the 128gb and am extremely happy with this purchase.

Great item, but Library is a little limited at this early stage and Quest can get heavy on the face if used for extended periods (i.e, in excess of one hour).  Otherwise, a great item at an excellent value.  Once Library is more robust, it will be even more useful and will get used more often.  Particularly effective when coupled with stereo headphones.

This is my first time using VR and it is an amazing experience. Also, freedom from wires and not having to connect to a computer is how all VR headsets should be. This headset exceeded my expectations. Many free games available, and others range from $5 to $30. I bought the 128GB since storage is not expandable. 64GB would work too since you can always redownload games if you run out of space. Most games don't take up too much space either. Few improvements could be made: Takes a little adjusting to get the headset comfortable on your face. Battery life could be better. Looking forward to improved resolution in the future.

The Quest hardware and software is very polished. This is VR’s iPhone moment. The First Steps program where you learn about the VR environment is super user friendly and magical. The graphics are about 75% of what you get on PC VR (which can run in the thousands after you buy a PC, graphics card, and headset). But the freedom of not being tethered by a cable to an expensive PC makes the games more fun and convenient. Throw it in a backpack and bring it anywhere. Setting up in a new room takes a minute. The headset is heavy. So you need to spend a little time adjusting the straps correctly.

I spent about 7 hours trouble shooting how to get the head set completely wireless just to find out you have to buy third party software and bug the system. It is a wired head set to the computer and wireless to a phone. I do have a computer that is WiFi and Bluetooth enabled. I was able to connect the head set via Bluetooth but the Oculus app does not recognize it. It must be connected with a cord. You will need to buy a cord to use the Oculus on a computer. The cord it comes with has a newer type (usb-c) and the majority of computers do not have the connector for it. Make sure you get a cord long enough or you will be sitting next to your computer.

Setup has a glitch, but was otherwise very user friendly. The untethered experience out of the box is impressively immersive, especially for a newbie. The built-in speakers add to the hassle-free design, providing enough quality for the less-demanding ears. Although the confusing marketing convinced me that the fifty games promoted with the Quest were included, the mistake was more my own due to inexperience. In case you are looking for the same answer, no, the Quest does not include any games, though a few are available for free.

So granted that this headset is relatively new.  The $100 up charge for 64GB of Flash (less than $5 to their cost) is a bit steep.  The upside is the standalone operation, no wires, no tethering to a gaming PC.  The downside is1) not a lot of game titles yet in the Quest store2) it loses it's appeal by not having a working casting method.  I tried at least 4 different IOS and Android devices and it won't cast to allow anyone to see what the player sees inside the head set.I've only had the unit for a week or so, and did notice some distortion in the Oculus TV videos. Not sure if it could be wifi related (thought the whole video is in the flash) but could be limited due to the limited performance of the Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU (vs. a mid-end Nvidia GPU if you use the Rift S tied to a PC)

I waited to get in to VR until a good headset was available and this was it. This is a GREAT item. The apps are great and all my family and friends love it (from age 7 to 80 they have all given it two thumbs up). I like the graphics & sound, the build quality is good, and new apps are continually coming out. The wireless aspect is fantastic and it is VERY easy to take to any location and have it ready to use in 30 seconds, no external computer needed. The only negative thing I can say is the head strap could be a bit more comfortable, but like other VR headsets mods are available.

This is the only VR headset you need! If your intent is to use the headset as a stand alone VR system, the games are fantastic and Oculus’ set up works great. Portable VR!If you have a PC that can handle Oculus and Steam VR, don’t waste your money with the Rift, Rift S or Vive. Get this, use a compatible cable or the one sold by Oculus, and enjoy VR from your PC. Even better, you can use software called Sidequest, Revive, and Virtual Desktop, and run both your Steam VR and Oculus libraries WIRELESSLY through your Quest. Playing your PC VR games without a tether is amazing as well.

So far I am impressed with the quest as a whole. It would be better if there were more games with it but its games list is growing all the time. If your new to vr or want to get in to it but dont have a vr ready pc this is the best choice on the market at the moment. And when you decide to pull the trigger on a vr ready PC you have occulus link that basically turns the quest in to a rift s. The only reason I can think for not buying this is if you already have a vr setup that you are happy with. The tracking limitations to using the front mounted cameras can be a bit of a problem if you put your hands behind your back for extended periods however for quick actions like swapping weapons and whatnot it generally works well. If your of the fence and dont have the money for a vr pc and a vr setup grab this and go.

Personally this has been the best purchase I've made in a long time. I felt uneasy about spending so much money on something but I did it anyway and haven't regretted it since.The biggest thing I've learned after buying the quest is to expect to pay more than for the quest itself. If you're not willing to spend an extra 100+ between games and accessories I wouldn't go for it. However a lot of accessories can be 3D printed for cheap, so keep that in mind.The battery on the headset doesn't last extremely long but that actually perfect because it can get uncomfortable after a long time. You can get/print a headband to add comfort, which helps a lot.The graphics aren't amazing but who cares, it's about the experience and the experience is amazing.

The Oculus Quest is amazing and definitely worth the extra $$ over the Oculus Go. The 2 controllers make everything interactive and you are able to scale your playing experience to the room or environment you are playing in(example: sitting, standing, small room, large room). More games are being added to their library and the selection already available is enough to keep you busy for a long time.If you are thinking of trying VR and are torn between this unit, Oculus Go, or PlayStationVR(I own all three) this is my favorite unit by far. It’s completely wireless, user friendly, and pretty much ready Togo our of the box(after charging).

I have loved the game play using Touch controllers with Rift, but I also loved the portability of the Go, even though it was not as immersive due to the lower quality graphics and point and click control schemes. The Oculus Quest bridges that gap perfectly. It is fully immersive with quality visuals and Touch controllers with amazing portability. Pull it out, turn it on, draw your guardian boundary, and your are playing in seconds, anywhere you take it. No cords to trip on. Good battery life (2-3 hours depending on the game) and fast recharging with the included 3 amp USB C charger. Buy it, you won't regret it.

Love this Oculus Quest.  I have not had a session yet where I was bored.  VR is the jam.  I can't compare to other VR headsets as I never owned them other than the Samsung Gear VR which don't count.  I have encounter glitches in the matrix however...randomly when playing the headset will jump back to home screen and sometimes mistrack the controllers even when at full or near full battery...my conclusion/theory is because of the sweat that the device absorbs as you play (i sweat alot when active) and sweat and electronics dont mix well....I have ordered some rim protectors but they didn't work too well...but I don't think they were built to absorb sweat, more so to protect you from others who use the device.

Well i used to own a DK1 and after the whole crazy setup and satellite stations fiasco in the world of VR i didnt buy a new headset. I was considering a few Windows MR headsets at the point were they announced the RiftS and the quest. I Thought of getting both and  gifting one to my brother. I have used it for around a month now and i got to say am amazed by what the mobile chipset can pull off. Dont expect the graphical quality of the rift S with a good graphics card. But wireless and don't have to turn on the pc is a more appealing thing than you know before the quest gets into your hands . The best part is watching netflix on the go or at home when you want to chill in bed and playing beatsaber and dance central anywhere.. Vader Immortal is an icing on the cake if you are a star wars fan. I would call this a must buy. BUUUUUT  if you have a good PC go for the rift S. I Was amazed by the simplicity and function of the quest but the rift S grew to my liking and now i mostly use the Rift S .The quest is more of a party fun gadget and this makes cross buy games worthwhile.. Otherwise the same games are way cheaper in steam. Well if you have the money buy both. IF you dont have another VR headset that is .. IF you do get the quest as its fun. IF you dont and can only buy one Rift s is my recomendation.

I’ve been on the fence about entering the VR gaming world for a few years. Almost to the plunge with PSVR, but decided to wait until the tech improved. After Quest was released I was hopeful this would be worth the plunge. Waited 5-6 months after release and have to say, wish I got it sooner.  It does take some getting used to and I would suggest getting some accessories to make it more comfy on your face/head, but that is the only slightly negative thing I can say about it.

An absolute must have for anyone interested in gaming and technology. The hand and body presence that the Quest gives in the virtual space is mind blowing. The physical build is sturdy and feels well made, the software is intuitive and smooth and gives a sense of ""Wow, how did they do that?"". A big barrier of VR in previous years has been the convoluted and time consuming set up required. The Quest is as easy to use as modern day consoles, just turn it on, wait a few seconds, and you're ready to go. I would say it is a serious competitor to modern day consoles.The headset is comfortable and I had no issues wearing it for extended periods of time. Sound is good but can be heard by others around you so for privacy headphones are needed. I usually get around 2-3 hours of battery life which I think is great as it allows you to decompress after an active session playing, but if you want to keep going the 10ft charging cable would allow you to do so just fine.There are tons of games and experiences to go through, some of my favorites being Rec Room, Beat Saber, and Sports Scramble. Note that a lot of the games on the Quest require a decent amount of physical activity so if you aren't in decent shape already, a couple hours of engaging VR will certainly get you there. I will say there isn't as much depth to the current games for my taste. As in many of the games feel more like an arcade than PC or console games. I guess you could say VR still hasn't found its WoW or Fortnite. However, the Quest shows that the hardware is there to support it, so with more time more in depth and long lasting games will almost certainly find their way to the Quest.Overall I couldn't be happier with the purchase and this feels like a premium product that I would recommend you try.

This was my first experience with VR and it is amazing.  You do actually feel like you're in another world.  Although the content is still somewhat limited, this definitely seems like the future of gaming and entertainment.  My main complaint is with the headset.  It is heavy and begins to feel uncomfortable after 20 minutes or so.  The harness seems cheaply made and doesn't do a good job of distributing the weight of the goggles.  I think for a little extra money it could be improved to add support like a catcher's mask.  Also the lenses tend to get smudged and you are advised not to use liquid to clean them but cleaning them with just a micro fiber cloth doesn't seem to take care of a smudge that may come from the oil on your face.

Only 1 profile possible.

This was my first venture into the world of VR and I am glad that the quest was my point of entry. The immersion you can feel in a game is incredible and I haven't experienced anything like it before. That being said, I underestimated how much open space I would actually need to where I wasn't constantly hitting the edges of the guardian system. I've also experienced some crashes in games like robo-recall which seem to happen when the guardian system displays the virtual border. Also, I am used to long form console games so transitioning to  VR ""experiences"" has been a bit of a challenge. I've found myself bingeing and beating a game over a couple of hours/days and not revisiting it again yet.Overall I am very happy with my Quest. I feel like  the crashes I have experienced will get sorted out by future software updates, and I'm hopeful that longer form games will make it into the Oculus Quest store sooner than later.

Although I thought it would come with games it did not. Games are 15-25$ per game. The headset gets heavy on the face after about 30 min. BUT SO FUN. For kids: beatsaber, moss, and journey of the gods, for adults, beatsaber, watching Netflix, Vader immortal. Kids and adults enjoy playing. Can be cast (projected) onto iPads or screens nearby so others can watch. Downside is that it is very one-person oriented.

In general Quest is obviously a big step forward.  Congrats Oculus!  However, I want take my 5.7K Insta360 One X and Pro 2 (8K) 360 videos into the VR domain.  When I watch the 5.7k videos from Instat360 OneX the video which is relatively clear on YouTube lacks detail when viewed on Quest.  That is a real problem for me.  Please jump the resolution up on your next VR generation Oculus.  As it is I just get head-aches watching blurry 360 videos.  Ugh.  Hoping the next version will be clearer on 5.7 and 8k 360 video.

This is the best purchase I've ever made. I have used other VR headsets but this one is so advanced it blew me away. It has room sensors similar to more expensive units like the Oculus Rift.

This is my 6th VR headset to date, been an enthusiast since I got my Oculus DK2 back in the day and moving on to the Vive, the RIft, the Oculus Go, the Vive Pro + the Vive wireless adapter and now the Quest. What a thrilling time this is.The Quest for me was worth every penny after experiencing it, shortly put if you want freedom of movement and always have a good immersive VR experience at a great resolution this is THE headset to buy, only thing to consider is you trade off freedom of movement and portability at the cost of super HQ graphics, which, to be clear, does not reduce the great experience in the games so far if done right by the devs, the trade off is noticeable in details like reflections, amount of objects in scenes, particle effects, things like that.So if what you are looking for are stunning graphics. at this point in time the Rift S would be your best alternative IF you have the video card and PC to support it, if not, dude (or dudette) go for the Quest you wont regret it, it's a blast.

History: I'm a HTC Vive owner and big fan of VR so i'l be comparing it here. For non-Vive/Oculus users you will love this thing!!!Overall experience is amazing. The portability and cordless is great!Pros: Lenses are great. Screen door effect feels lesser than the Vive oddly enough.Tracking is 90% as good as the Vive i'd say. You rarely ever notice it having an issue. Most of the time it depends on how well the game makes use of it.Cons: Battery life is only 2 to 3 hours (from what i've heard but I haven't used it enough straight to hit it).Obviously the graphical output can't match the Vive so games (Robo recall) has decreased detail.

This is my third VR headset and I love it. I wish Oculus had a bigger library and that they would put better titles on sale, but this is still my favorite headset.  Compared to the Rift and the PSVR, the ease of use can't be beat. Visuals are better on the Rift, but I'm more inclined to use the Quest since I don't have to waste any time troubleshooting, and the time between powering it on and playing a game is pretty darn quick.

This is a good vr headset, but there aren't many games available, and from what I have read, this is because Oculus is not opening their store to other devs.It tracks pretty well, but loses the hand controllers occasionally.

First I gotta say the Oculus Quest is my first VR system and I had no idea what to expect. At first it too a while to get use to the movement at least personally as it felt weird to be immersed through the eye yet move with little movement of the feet but more with the thumbs. But after a while, I can definitely see the endless potential that VR has in the future especially with more and more enticing games coming in the future. With that being said I definitely recommend getting more storage as it can never go wrong. Over the Oculus Quest is the top VR system against its competitors!

No crossplay with previous games means I would have to rebuy all of the games I already own for the Oculus rift. The tracking is not great and looses it completely when close to face or behind. The screen refresh rate has been lowered. The sound is barely there at all. Not compatible with steam or Viveport. They used an old chip for the processing.

This product is way way better than I expected. I thought the graphics would be completely terrible, but they aren't. I thought the tracking wouldn't be that good, but it is pretty fantastic. I would say the biggest cons are 1. heavy on the face, but you can mitigate that by attaching a battery brick to the back of the headset. 2. the audio is good, but missing a bit of bass, and everyone around you can hear it.

There is so much to love about the Oculus Quest that puts above other V.R. systems. The ability to play V.R. games without being tethered by a cord or P.C. hives the Oculus Quest more freedom than its sister systems. The controllers work well, with the hand tracking movements and the soon to be hand tracking movement without controllers.The only downfall of the Quest is the store. Due to its portability and not needing a P.C., the store is limited to some games of quality, but not all. Although you can run Steam games through a work around of the system, it becomes a hassle and this the need for a P.C. that can run V.R. games returns.

I have been a VR enthusiast for years and have owned everything from the original cardboard phone VR viewers to multiple Oculus Rifts devices. I currently own 3 x GearVR, Google Daydream, PSVR, and 2 x Oculus Rift. With all of this the best virtual reality device and experience I have ever had is the Oculus Quest. The ease of setup, simplicity, and the freedom of having no cables tethering me to a PC makes it so much better. The experience I had with Vader Immortal ($9.99) is unsurpassed.  Highly recommend!

Really love the occulas quest. One of the best investments I ever made because  there are  some games  that are made  for meditation, exercise.There are even  YouTube videos that help you get the maximum use out of your Oculus Quest.  But even if you don't use  Sidequest or any extra stuff  it's still a good buy.

We bought the oculus as a family activity. We got several different games (Beat Saber, I Expect You to Die, OrvisVR, Star Wars, etc). The helmet is easy to operate and the controls are simple enough for my 9 year old daughter. The only downside is the streaming capability for same room is still limited on the Quest. We are using a chromecast 3G on an LG qled, and there is about a 1 to 2 second delay. (Doesn't seem like much but if you are playing a rythm game like Beat Saber, it is enough to confuse the player. We get around it by just muting the TV and letting the oculus sound play). Overall, it was a wonderful purchase that I believe my family and I will enjoy for a long while.

If you've ever considered trying out a VR headset but were confused about how it works or what's necessary (connecting to a gaming PC etc), this is the product for you. Everything you need to get going is in the box. You don't have to worry about hooking it up to a PC or setting up tracking stations. You just slap it on and go.In my opinion, this is the VR that the market has been waiting for. It has the full room scale freedom and fully articulated controllers of a PC based headset with the wireless freedom and ease of use that you get with systems like the Oculus Go or Samsung Gear VR.Speaking as someone who owns (for now) the HTC Vive, the Quest is incredible. The drawbacks of running on a mobile processor instead of a gaming PC are a small price to pay for the ease of use and portability.If you've been waiting to jump in or just find yourself letting your wired headset sit and collect dust, consider the Quest.

I was hesitant going in to the all in one VR headset simply because I thought it would make major compromises on quality to run well. I was happily proven wrong. Every game I try blows my mind on how well they look on such a compact device. The resolution is top notch compared to other PC VR headsets I've tried. On my demo of it which lasted only a minute at a store I noticed some glitches with the hand tracking, but my unit after hours of use I didn't notice a single issue. The interface is super friendly to anyone who has VR experience before and also for those with non at all. My dad who can barely send out an email on the computer was easily able to navigate through the menus of the Oculus Home. They have set the Gold Standard for stand alone VR and if this is first big consumer one out I have high hopes for the future of VR as well as AR. Definitely worth every penny.

I've had the Oculus Rift DK2, the HTC Vive and now this unit. Overall experience I would say this wins hands down. It doesn't have the graphic fidelity of PC games such as Elite Dangerous, but it does VR games very well. The wireless experience is a game changer. Most games I enjoy anyway in VR are simple arcade type games, wingsuit flying, rollercoaster, Job Simulator silliness. Other games like Vader, ping pong and arcade shoot em ups are great fun too. The wireless experience lets you enjoy VR even when you're short on time, something that was hard to do with PC setups like the Vive. Being able to put on the headset and play beat saber for 5 minutes before doing other chores is a great way to relax. Definitely get the travel case to maximise its portability.

This was great, until it wasn't.  Stopped charging and dead after 35 days. I get that items can be defective, but I went to the company tech support, that went to chat. After stupid stuff like plug into different outlets (duh) and my repeatedly writing that I was getting  a blinking red light for 5 seconds (a clear error), they to leave it plugged in overnight.  Which, of course was already done.  Pretty lousy support and a 500+ buck cost for 30 days of play.

This device will blow your mind. Full room-scale VR but without the need for a PC: no cords to manage, no complex setup to figure out, just pure immersion in VR. If you haven't tried VR before now is the time and this is the headset you should get. It's pricey but worth every penny. The games aren't cheap either ($10-$30 each), but Beat Saber, Vader Immortal and Robo Recall have already made me completely satisfied with my investment. The future of VR looks very bright inside one of these headsets. Do yourself and your loved ones a favor and get this amazing piece of technology!

As expensive as this headset was, I personally enjoy playing on it from time to time! With the relatively high storage capacity and portability of the console, I can essentially play any game anywhere, from public parks to front yards! You can even play with it on roadways (but don't, because it's not safe and people would probably get upset)! There is no PC required, so do yourself a favor and get this headset if you want to avoid the hassle of paying thousands for a state-of-the-art PC as well as an off-brand headset!

The oculus quest works great on its own, but there seems to be major faults in computer connection issues. I can find many issues online about having ""no usb 3 connection"" going back about 3 months now, most of which involve laptops but some desktops.

I had no experience with VR gaming and very little experience with any gaming. My son let me play with his Oculus Rift S and it was awesome experiencing VR gaming. The Oculus Quest is nice in that it is wireless (the Oculus Rift S. is not) and that means it is portable. It is a lot of fun to play and your family and friends will enjoy it as well. The size and weight of the headset take getting used to and battery life needs to be longer, but you still can do a lot with the about two hours you get. Treat yourself and get one!

If you are in the market for this product then you should already be familiar with its pros and cons. My tip is buy through Amazon because their return policy is excellent. My first unit had an issue with the right display, tried to contact Oculus for support but they did not first reach back out for an entire week.  I was worried I was going to fall out of Amazons window, so i just pushed forward and set up the replacement. Dropped it off at Kohls, and received the new fully functional unit in a short time.

The Oculus account only allows for a single member profile.  If you have multiple family members who want to play, you'll need to set up separate profiles with separate emails and purchase each game separately for each account.

It broke after a month and a half. Volume button stuck. Search online found multiple other people with the same issue who gave up and returned it.

There is no other product you can buy that provides so much for VR while asking for so little.  You don't need gaming pc with a giant graphics card.  You don't need to set up cameras.  Turn it on and go.  For ~$400 you can have an immersive high quality VR experience without a single wire.  This is the VR headset that will set fire to waves of people coming to VR.  The library is excellent and the graphics quality is outstanding at this price point.  Very happy with my purchase.

Even with all the hype and built up expectations, this piece of technology will blow your mind. If you can find someone who has one, see if you can try it. Reading reviews / watching videos will not do this experience justice. The headset is not without comfort issues.

This seems to be a true Non cable VR and with the introduction of ""Sideloading"" you cannbasically play any PCVR game ans stream it to the oculus Quest, if you have fast internet that it.

My only complaint is a small one, I wish the battery covers on the hand controls were more secure since they have a tendency to start slipping open in the middle of high activity games.

There's not much else to say other than it delivers what is promised.You can get away with 64GB version, but if you plan on having a bunch of games or side-loading content go with 128GB.Comfort and graphics a take a hit for portability and PC-less VR, but personally it's worth it to have VR content close at hand for a quick hour when you have time to relax/play/watch.

By far the most fun I've had with a VR device ever.  If you ever have the opportunity to get the Oculus Quest.  Do it, it's so much fun.  The only issue I have, is that there are only a handful of games you can input different users or profiles.  Otherwise you need to continue the game where the last player left off.  Fix this issue and it will nearly be flawless.

What s the worst thing about the HTC Vive? I thought it was the umbilical cord that wouldn't let me stretch my legs and cord would consistently pull me out of the game, so to speak. The Oculus Quest All-in-one VR Gaming Headset – 128GBchanges that aspect by cutting and completely removing any tethers. You know that feeling of being lost in a book or being swept away by a movie? Gamers don't like any distractions and the Quest provides a more immersive experience than the Vive in my opinion. The Oculus Quest All-in-one VR Gaming Headset – 128GB has integrated speakers that were good enough that I didn't miss the headphones that the Vive requires. Headphones do not come with the Quest but it comes equipped with 2 stereo headphone 3.5mm connections. You get 2 controllers, the headset , paperwork and charging cable. It's a much cleaner gaming experience too.There are not that many games available at launch. I saw about 50 available games but you get so much more software such as VR video experiences, a movie theater and streaming TV shows.It's unfair to compare the Vive with this because they are directed at different audiences. One is a social experiment and the other is a living entity of gamers with people like Pong who rule on high. Commodore 64, Atari, Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis... We've grown into a force of nature.What I didn't really like were the cartooney graphics. It's pretty much a phone in a headset due to its Snapdragon 835 CPU which is typically used on Android smartphones. Suffice to say this makes available horsepower limited so it becomes a game of compromises. You lost the cords but also the superpcharged graphics that came with it.One of the worst experiences I had was with Epic Roller Coasters. The graphics feel stripped down to barebones so it doesn't offer any gaming immersion. What do you hear when you go up a roller coaster? Usually you hear the chain or whatever mechanism is pulling you to your plunge of doom. That doesn't exist in Epic Roller Coasters. You feel like you're just floating along and that isn't fun.There's just so many limitations that come with the Oculus Quest All-in-one VR Gaming Headset – 128GB that its asking price of $500 would be better served in upgrading a current PC's graphics card assuming the CPU can support it. That's coming from a PC gamer. This however isn't really aimed at PC gamers because we know what's possible graphically speaking when it comes to digital gaming.Do I recommend the Oculus Quest All-in-one VR Gaming Headset – 128GB?No I don't. Are you new to gaming with some money to burn? You will be entertained!!!! It had its moments but way too few and far between to keep me interested.

Finally a VR headset that doesn’t need to be tethered to an expensive gaming PC (or PS4 in the case of PSVR), or your phone. That alone got me interested in the Quest. Yes, it does sacrifice some quality compared to the Rift, but considering this is on the heavy side as it is - the weight of a set that could match the Rift would likely to way too much.This VR set shows what the future of VR can be when they figure out how to untether it from PCs and consoles.Why you should get this:• Even if it can’t quite match the Rift it still looks great. So far framerates have been great as well. The infamous screen door effect isn’t a bother for me.• It’s portable. Once you set it up all you need is the headset, controllers, and maybe the wall charger for when it dies.• No cords. You never have to worry about tripping on the cord or having to stay close to the PC. You can easily move to any room.• Headset tracking is flawless, and controller tracking is very good even around the edges. I was a bit concerned the tracking wouldn’t match the Rift, I’m glad I was wrong.• Games selection. It shares the same store as other Oculus sets, though it doesn’t have access to the entire catalog (due to some games simply needing the power of the full Rift). But even at this early stage it has a nice selection, and I have every reason to expect it will continue improving.• Price. It’s pretty reasonably priced as far as true VR sets go. The only cheaper sets are Google cardboard, and theWhy you may want to wait for the next gen:• It’s heavy. Others have said this and they’re right. Compared to the Rift this is far heavier on my face. This makes it the least comfortable VR set I’ve tried. But It’s not a deal breaker for me. Whether this is a deal breaker for you is going to vary by person. If you’re concerned, I suggest you try one in a store or make sure to buy it from somewhere with a good return policy (like here on Amazon).• Battery life is only ok. You won’t have to cut most gaming sessions short, but you can’t take it on a trip without brining the charger along. You can use it while charging, but then you have the cord to worry about.• While the graphics are good, they’re not up to the level you’ve seen with the Rift, let alone the newer Rift S• Facebook. This has to be mentioned given Facebook’s poor reputation lately. Oculus is owned by Facebook, and while your account is separate, it’s still being stored on Facebook servers. If you’re concerned about how they handle data you might want to think about going with another brand. For me, like many people, I already have a Facebook account. So I figure the damage (if any) is done, they won’t learn more about me from Oculus.

I'm not a gamer and this is my first time using a VR headset and I LOVE it. It's really incredible. The feeling of spaciousness and the ability to move around, pick things up, and interact with characters is next-level stuff! The build quality of the Oculus is fantastic and every button, strap, and connector is strategically place to be easy to find or connect.I wish there had been more info on the basics of the device and a better diagram of what button does what, as it took me quite some time to figure that stuff out. Of course, once I did it all made perfect sense. It's great that they have youtube and Netflix set up for you to log into immediately so you can start experiencing huge-screen and immersive videos right away. There's a little helper program where you interact with a robot that teaches you how to pick things up which is actually pretty fun and I've done it a few times just to play. The overall set up for me went very smoothly and I didn't have any issues with connecting to my iPhone for creating my account and choosing apps to download.The sound is surprisingly good with little speakers at ear level that sort of shoot the sound into your ear. I know you can connect your own earbud/headphones, but I haven't felt the need to do that.I've played a few games but for me, I really just prefer watching videos. Even going on facebook is more fun because you can see every picture as if it were gigantic. I especially love seeing my facebook memories so large.The joysticks are super cool and are easy to use once you get the hang of it. I've had a lot of fun pointing the little lasers at things and selecting or moving things. It's so elegantly connected that it feels very natural.The only negatives for me are that I wish the headset was lighter and I have a slight concern that it leaves impression marks on my face after an hour or so of use. I definitely felt some soreness in my neck after the first session, so I'd suggest working up some neck strength slowly. A good thing is the you can lay back on some pillows if you just want to watch movies.I LOVE this VR headset! It's a lot of fun, the screen image and immersive quality are incredible, and I totally recommend it.I've attached some pics from my unboxing so you can see what you get.

The greatest thing about the Oculus Quest is that you have no wires attached!  This may not sound like a big deal, until you are mid round in Beat Saber and have to dodge a wall in your living room.  All of the other VR systems that I have used require a powerful PC connected to the VR headset with wires.This is not just a VR headset but a VR gaming console and headset in one.  For that reason, it is a little bit heavier than other VR headsets but surprisingly not much heavier.  That being said, the extra weight does make it more difficult to keep it on your face for extended periods of time.  (your face starts to hurt a little)The head straps are adjustable and hold the unit in place really well.  They are also easy to adjust.The screen is exceptional.  The refresh rate is higher than the other VR headsets that I have experienced making it less likely to cause motion sickness and easier to use for an extended period of time.  The colors and bright and the picture is sharp.The 128GB version is nice but at the moment there are not enough games being offered to fill it.  (in the future there will be more games offered)The controllers work really well without having to have external sensors around your room like other VR systems.  That being said, they are not quite as accurate as controllers that have external sensors.  The Quest is portable!Even though the Quest is portable, you should NOT use it outside.  The lenses on the inside of any VR headset are easily damaged by direct sunlight.  There are YouTube videos of people using it outside but it is not recommended and can damage your headset.You need to create an account for the Quest or use a Facebook login to set the system up.  There are a few demos and apps available for free but to be able to actually enjoy the experience you will want to buy some games.  Beat Saber and Super Hot are two very popular titles. (read: must have)You definitely do not look cool when using any VR headset.  I watch my kids play and look like nerdy mimes.  (picking up items and making hand motions, etc)This console would be a great item to bring to a party.  (any age will enjoy it)The battery life is between 2.5 and 3 hours long.  That sounds like a long a time until your kids drain it completely and have to wait 1.5 hours to play again.  (it charges with USB C) The controllers seem to eat AA batteries for breakfast.  This is not a big concern  for us though, we just buy large packs of AA batteries to have on hand.My son used zip ties to strap an external battery to the headband.  Alternately, you could put the battery in your pocket but you have to deal with the wire which will probably get in the way.  (by probably I mean absolutely)  This handy tip can help you and kids get an unhealthy amount of screen time.If you really want to get into tweaking the software, you can side load games, music and software on the system.  As far as I know, this is fairly new and is still experimental.  At this point my son loaded custom songs on Beat Saber successfully.

So this was my first time ever trying a VR experience of any kind.  I hadn't really had any desire or experience to try it before and to be honest I didn't know what to expect at all or have anything to compare to.  When I got the opportunity to test and review this product though I figured why not try something new.I am an avid gamer.  I have a huge steam library, an office full of CD-Rom's from decades ago, and even a box full of 3.5"" floppies that I do still play from.  Most of my gaming experiences have been on PC or with the Wii and then Wii U that I mostly got for my kids.  So one of the first things I wondered to myself is whether I can connect this to my Steam and play Steam's VR games (which I've never paid much attention to before but remembered seeing oculus on the site... well I looked into it and the unfortunately it can't.  Well not officially anyways.  Apparently you can sideload  things in developer mode so that you can stream from your PC but I'm not advocating doing that.  My hope is that they will officially release something in the near future that will allow you to do that without side loading.  The chances seem to me to be pretty good that it could eventually happen since ALVR was added as an official app for the Oculus Go.So the next thing I was inteested in finding out was ""What games can I play on it?""  I have to admit I was a little dissapointed by the available selection.  The Oculus Rift has a lot of choices but the Oculus Quest's choices are really limited.  There are only 4 games currently available that I have even the slightest interest in but, seeing as the Quest was only just released on May 21st (only 1 week ago at the time of writing this) I'm fairly certain that the library will grow over time just as the Rift's did.What's really great about the Quest is that it offers you a truly wireless VR experience (unless you want to use headphones... you still have to plug those into the 3.5mm jack).  The VR headset doesn't need to connect to a computer at all.  It will connect wirelessly to access it's library and for many games does not need a continued connection so you really can take it almost anywhere and play.  You never have to worry about the wires getting in your way or anything.  I really REALLY like that.So in terms of use, I found the headset to be easy to charge, easy to put on and adjust the size.  My nose is so small compared to the nose opening that I have a 1 inch gap between the glasses and my nose tip.  I can slide my finger all the way around between it and my nose easily.  This lets in a lot of light from below and I might have rig some fabric strip so it can cover that gap.  On my husband however, there is no gap or almost none so obviously if looking for a one size fits all sizing they were not wrong to make it that large.  I found it hard to adjust the pupil sizing.  I couldn't see much difference in the calibration mode as I slid it but I did have to adjust it more than once while trying to read menu options in the device.You need to register with Oculus and download their app.  Then pair your device.  It walks you through the setup and it's very easy.  The headset probably will need to update before you can use it... mine took less than 5 minutes.  I tried several apps that were free and some demos to get a feel for the VR experience and this device.  I think I actually played around with it in various ways for about 2 hours.  The battery still had a pretty good charge on it so I'm assuiming you could probably get 4 hours or more of playtime on it (though I wouldn't recommend that)  After my 2 hours I was headache-y and a little nauseated...  I think that it's mostly getting used to the experience and probably you should do acclimatize yourself a little more gradually in 30 minute or less segments at first to get used to it even if you're only going to be playing in 1 hour increments.I first went through the tutorial app learning how to pick up, turn, throw, pull, etc... using the controllers.  Then I gave the 'Beat Saber Demo' a try.  It let's you do a tutorial and one demo level.  It was a lot more fun than I had expected and actually was pretty good exercise.  I really liked the exercise potential of the Wii and Wii U which is what prompted me to get them for my kids but I like this experience even better and see a lot of  even better potential for fitness games on this device especially being wireless.  Being from Minnesota where 3/4 of our year experiences weather that's not really good for outdoor activity these kinds of things are great because they give us a way to maintain a fitness level over the long winters.Besides being a good fitness tool 'Beat Saber"" was also really fun.  Everyone in the family liked it... enough that I'm considering buying the full game.  I then tried the Netflix app.  It really does feel like you're sitting in a home theater and the surroundings are very pleasant to look at and you feel very comfortable in your large spacious living room.  However, I wasn't impressed with the video quality or the sound quality of watching movies and shows there.  My living room TV is a 56in screen so not tiny but not as large as the app's TV is meant to seem.  It's just basic level HD it was one of those earlier TV's when 1080p was still a new definition.  So, I'm not used to viewing in 4k or anything but the picture felt to me like it was acually lower than standard SD quality... not quite as bad as VHS quality though.  It actually seemed more like when we watch movies off our SD quality projector but pull it a little further back than it's intended to be used so it's no longer SD quality but it's much larger.  The sound through the built in speakers was't sounding great.  I'm not sure if it would sound better with headphones but I didn't try it.  Considering the display is supposed to be better definition than a lot of other models I was expecting a much better picture than what I was experiencing.Next I tried the free coaster game which actually was more fun than I was expecting but that's when I started feeling nauseated.  I don't get that way in OMNI Movies or on real coasters but I had to stop mid ride.  I'm not sure if it was because the experience of VR is new to me or if it was too much to handle while fasting.My kids 15, 14, and 9 and my husband all really enjoyed 'Beat Saber' and the VR experience in general.  My husband played for maybe 30-45 minutes and got a little bit of a headache too.  My kids each got to try one round of the Beat Saber demo (maybe 5 minutes of trying the goggles out) before bed and none complained of any issues with headache or nausea.Overall, if you are looking for a more affordable VR experience the Oculus Quest and Rift seem to be a lower priced console system with many VR sets being closer to the $1000 price tag or more and these coming in at half the price or less.  If your main objective is to connect to Steam VR or other PC VR experiences the Rift is probably a better fit for you but you must connect to a PC.  If you are looking for a standalone set (that may be able to stream Steam at some point in the future or through sideloading) then the Quest is probably better for you.  It's wireless design in my opinion is way better than the Rifts wired design but it's available titles are much smaller at this time and you can't officially connect to Steam or VR games outside of the Oculus offerings.If you want to get into VR gaming I'd definately recommend this VR set.

As my headline states, I'm a first time VR headset owner so these are just my opinions but I was blown away with the Oculus QuestI've tried on other VR headsets in the past and liked them but wasn't blown away. The graphics/resolution in the older sets were OK but nothing to write home about. Then you had the wires getting in the way and of course the higher price tag so I decided I'd wait until the tech advanced, I'm so glad I did.Setup was very easy, much easier than I thought it would be, I was using them in no time. It walks you through the setup and it was very easy to follow.The headset is a little on the heavy side so it took a little time to get used to. The key is to adjust the headset for a snug fit. Too tight, it's going to hurt and leave marks on your face, too loose and it's going to flop around during use. I also wear glasses and it comes with an insert for those who have glasses, use it. I tried to wear it without the insert and it worked but wasn't comfortable.The headset is rechargeable and has really good battery life, the 2 hand controllers use 1 AA battery each and they're included. It has built in speakers that sound really good making the experience even more enjoyable.These are new so there may be limited games available for the headset but I'm sure as time goes on, there will be many more available.My only ""gripe"" besides the weight of the headset is the nose area. I know it's hard since peoples faces are very different but my nose is on the smaller side which allows some light to enter the headset. It's not a show stopper and it isn't too bad except when I look down.There are so many cool things about this headset that I could go on and on about. If you've been on the fence with VR, these goggles really are a game changer and you should give them a try.

This is a great setup that worked well both for me, a 62-year-old guy with progressive lens glasses, and my 34-year-old daughter. I really didn't think they would work well with my glasses but after a few minutes of visual adjustment, I didn't even notice any difference (I did shift my glasses a bit higher on my face which wasn't a problem). Neither one of us noticed any discomfort with the headset.I did find myself wishing more demos were included with the game but there are two we both loved–the Beat Saber Game, and Space Alien game. The saber game is not only super fun but it is a good workout too. You'll have to trust me because I didn't think it would be any fun either when my daughter described it to me. You cut flying cubes in half as they fly toward you with a lightsaber in each hand. The visuals are great and the effect perfectly engaging. I played for an hour at a time and got a good workout each time while having a lot of fun. I only wish that there was a casting option so others could watch your performance.The setup is easy and the effect of the VR is so real it is freaky. There is a sensor that creates a grid-like wall to let you know were your real walls are so if you get too close they will pop up and warn you to take a step or two backward. Overall this is a really ingenious setup. I would recommend getting the larger memory. I know we are going to want to get lots of games and the extra memory will come in handy in the future.

This is my first VR headset since the VR boy-- so, this review will (necessarily) be from an outsiders perspective.This is going to be a long review because it's a complex product.My thesis is simply this: It's a new technology, has a lot of growing to do, but is also amazing. This feels like a generational shift to me. But perhaps one that has been mismanaged.So let's talk about video. I don't know how common this is-- but only certain parts of the screen seemed to be in focus no matter what I did. I got used to it, and after a short time, it wasn't a problem. The colors and vibrancy were, muted. It reminded me of early Wii games without the delicate artistry or understanding of the medium. The ""screen door effect"" manifested itself as more of a visual snow to me, a lack of focus, and certainty. These things being said-- I quickly adapted.Audio-- the built-in speakers are surprisingly good. They're good enough for a video game, but not good enough to watch a movie or listen to music. There are ports on the side, but they may be custom, I'm not really sure.Battery life was adequate, I was getting 4 to 5 hours depending on the task.Overall function-- there are some ""gotchays"" or things you might not think about. The minimum play area is 6.5x6.5 feet. This means you need a 7x7 space realistically to play-- and it can't be outdoors. Direct sunlight seems to wash out the sensors, but a cloudy day seems to work fine.The virtual guardian is impressive-- this thing keeps you in your safe space. At the beginning of each session, you trace out where it is safe for you to walk, and when you get close to those boundaries, a view of where you are gradually fades in, and you see a cage indicating where you are able to walk. This is perhaps the most underrated feature of the entire thing. It really feels underutilized as an AR platform. Yes, it would need more hardware than it has to do this, but a missed opportunity for sure.There are some considerations I'm not sure have been addressed. Despite being generally amazing-- safety is an issue. It takes a little time to retrain your brain. We naturally lean backward or forward to maintain our center of balance based on visual information. You can lose your balance simply because of this-- is not a weakness of the Oculus, just a weakness of humans.On the subject of pet's, toddlers and to a lesser extent, people-- I have a 2.5-year-old child and a 14-year-old chihuahua. Neither had any compunction about stepping into my ""play space"" or spreading toys about, or throwing up bile at your feet because she wanted human food instead of dog food. You need to not only be aware of your space but what, unintended things could happen. Toddlers should be in bed; dogs should be outside, etc.On the subject of the overall power of the system-- I was unable to play 4k videos natively, and sometimes had some skipping playing 1k videos. It was hit or miss. Playing videos on Occulus despite its low resolution is fantastic. I'm more excited about this then the games (and yes, VR adult content is available from your usual hubs). I am intensely interested in how I can author a VR YouTube channel but have had difficulty finding guidance.So let's talk software-- this is probably the least impressive thing about the Oculus quest. The Quest is lacking its Casablanca or Grim Fandango moment. I had fun playing some of the games, but there's no killer app. Most of the games are ports of the same old game mechanics we all grew up with. Perhaps I set my sights too high, But I was hoping for something transformative.I happen to be a software engineer and thought I'd give writing some apps for the Quest a shot; I was that impressed. Sadly, the SDK is pretty restrictive. You have to submit your app idea as soon as possible in the development phase to Oculus. In other words, this is a closed platform. This is a shame for a platform that hardly has any titles, and more the less has very few engaging titles.Ultimately, the success of Quest will depend on two things-- their ability to refine the hardware, and ability to attract new software, which I would wager they have failed at right now.All things being equal-- this device is fantastic. It is partially set up for failure by its software licensing scheme and conversely set up for success by its incredible hardware.Ultimately, the Oculus Quest is a beautiful wife who won't sleep with you. It could be perfect if it weren't for that one thing.

This is the first VR headset I’ve ever used. The setup was fairly straightforward. Users should be aware that they will have to create accounts and give access codes to their wifi. After charging the headset, the user is then given the opportunity to practice with a free app to move objects with their virtual hands in a gorgeous virtual space. You can then go to the “store” and purchase games and videos. Each game has its own button functions and they can be hard to learn. Most games start at around 15 dollars and go up from there so choose wisely.  Sometimes there is a demo and sometimes there isn’t. There is a return policy on many apps if you do not play them for more than 2 hours and have them for less then 14 days, though I haven’t tried the process.The headset is heavy as many reviewers have mentioned. The skin under my eyelids was being pulled down, so I think time using this VR headset will be limited.The quality of the video resolution is good - not great. You can easily see the pixels. I kept yearning for higher resolution, especially in live action video.  Video frame rate is very smooth. No stuttering at all, The controller(s) responsiveness is very good, too. Very little lag.I think this will be a great VR setup for teens- if they can deal with the weight of the headset. For me, the weight and the resolution are not quite there yet.

I am someone who has a powerful gaming PC but never thought about diving into the world of VR. I wear glasses or contacts and thought it wouldn't work very well. I also didn't like that you have to be tethered to your powerful desktop to play most VR games and I just kind of had a ""maybe in the future"" attitude. Because none of my local friends have a VR headset, I just never got to try one. Well, Oculus has changed the game with this new Quest VR system. NO COMPUTER required, No tethering, and you can take this anywhere, which is absolutely a game changer.I want to note that I am not comparing this to the current Oculus Rift or other powerful VR systems with higher resolution monitors. This is my first real VR experience and I couldn't be more impressed with how easy it was to set up and use, and I was and still am blown away by how immersive the whole experience is. Yes, there are some black areas and it's almost like looking through binoculars, but it doesn't bother me because you get a full 6 degrees of movement and it really is like stepping into another world when you put these on. For anyone thinking about getting into VR but maybe you don't have a powerful computer or you want something portable, this is a no brainer. There is nothing even close to this powerful on the market. I know it might seem like I'm 'overly excited but to be honest, I haven't been this excited about an electronic product for years, and I am fortunate enough to review a lot of really great things.Build quality of the hardware is very good. The headset is a bit front heavy, but once you get it adjusted it's not too bad, and seeing as there is a full mini computer and battery pack in the headset, it's understandable that it's going to be a bit heavier than other VR headsets. The controllers are comfortable to hold and take almost no time to get used to. You can use them to grab things, throw objects, and interact with the world you are in. The controllers really add to the experience and I can't imagine using an XBOX controller or something like that, it just wouldn't be the same experience.A quick side note for people who wear glasses: It still works. There is a little insert to make it work better when wearing glasses and although it takes me a little bit to get the angle right, it does work when I'm wearing glasses. However, the experience is just a bit better when wearing contacts for me. There's no glare and it's easier to get a crisp focus without glasses. Still, the experience isn't bad and once you get into a game, it isn't really an issue. I play both ways now and it's been just fine. You do need some sort of eyewear though if your vision is bad, as this unit will not focus your vision if you are nearsighted. I have heard of companies that make custom lenses with your prescription which is a great idea but also makes it harder to share this with others, one of my favorite features of this device.I want to keep this review short but there's so much I could talk about. I'll touch on my favorite things. There are so many reviews for this headset and most are positive and as of the time I'm posting this, this headset is sold out in both size configurations, usually the sign of a good product. I get the same kind of feeling using this as I did when I first used the Nintendo Wii. It's just a special experience and being in the 3D world is just amazing, even though the graphics are somewhat simplistic compared to modern console games.Speaking of graphics, they aren't bad. They are just basic. The mobile Snapdragon 835 processor they used for this is powerful though, and is projecting two 1440x1600 images at 72hz refresh rate, which gives it a nice smooth feel. The original Oculus Rift was 1080x1200 and required a powerful PC to use it, so this is a big step up. Specs aside, it's just impressive how immersive the experience is, and one of the coolest features is using the Oculus app to cast whatever is on the screen to a phone or tablet. I have tried casting to both an iPhone and iPad and it looks great, although it's slightly choppier than what you see when you are playing. A red dot appears in the headset so you know if someone is watching what you play since they could grab your phone and start a cast without you seeing since you are in your own world so that's a nice feature. I want to touch on the audio quality of the built in speakers. They are ok but they lack bass. What I like to do for games that focus on audio is use nice over the ear headphones. You can plug them in to either side of the headset and it really improves the overall sound quality. Bluetooth is not an option. The built in sound isn't terrible though, it's certainly good enough for most basic games that aren't music based.Games. Ok so this is important. Are the games any good? So far, yes although the selection seems fairly limited at the moment. You get a really cool ""training"" game that is great for first time VR users. It's fun and really impressed me. You also get several demo games, with the best one being Beat Saber. I'm sure you have heard it before, but this is a must buy. It's 30 dollars but you can play the demo to make sure you like it. It just looks and feels fantastic and it's a game anyone can play and feel cool doing it. The casting is especially useful for this game as you can play with friends watching and you can trade off, taking turns trying to beat challenging levels. I also really liked the Scramble Sports demo and may purchase it. I hope to see more games added and with how popular the Quest is, I expect developers to jump on board and either port other VR games over or develop new games for the system.In addition to games, there are video watching apps like Netflix, ESPN, and YouTube, with YouTubeVR being the only one to really benefit from the 6 axis technology, as you can watch 360 videos and look all around you and be immersed in those videos. Kind of fun. It's also kind of cool to watch Netflix or YouTube on a large screen in front of you. The resolution isn't bad but I found myself getting a headache after watching for a while, so it's more of a novelty than anything but a cool option.I want to briefly touch on the setup process. With previous VR headsets, you had to mount little transponder units in your home so the headset would know where you are. Not the case with the Quest. There are 4 cameras on the headset and you set up a ""guardian"" perimeter and you really just need about 6 square feet of space to play most games, and as little as 3.5 square feet, otherwise you will need to play in stationary mode which is not as fun but still works. The guardian mode is amazing and takes just a few seconds to set up if you go to a new area. This is one of the more impressive features and one of the first things you do when you first turn the system on and really shows you how advanced the headset is. As soon as you approach the edge of your defined area, it alerts you in a gentle way that doesn't break the immersion but keeps you safe. I really applaud Oculus for this feature, it's a great way to keep your mind at ease although you do still need to be careful if you have any pets sitting in the guardian area as the system won't alert you to those.  I try to shuffle my feet a little if I know my dog is in the area.Overall, I really can't say enough good things about the Oculus Quest. It's not perfect, but this is really really really young technology and I'm more than impressed with what they have done with their first all in one VR headset. Being able to travel with this anywhere and escape to play some games in a hotel room when on a business trip is so easy and a great way to relax. Internet is not required to play any of the games I've tried but most games do use internet connectivity when available. It's easy to share this with friends and the casting feature works well and is a great option if other people are around. The battery life is about 2-3 hours but I found that I usually need a break after a couple hours. The unit charges using any USB-C cable and a nice long one is included in the box. The Oculus app will tell you how charged the headset is, and there is also a light on the unit that turns green when fully charged. This headset has gotten me into the world of VR and I'm excited to see where it goes next. Better quality graphics is probably the biggest need to take things to the next level but it's nice to see how much is possible with the simple graphics available today.The Oculus Quest is so much better than I thought it would be. I would recommend it to anyone, especially if you've been on the fence about jumping into VR. My biggest regret is not getting into VR earlier, but this is as good of a time as any to get started and I look forward to new games coming out for the Quest. Finally I want to say that I don't know that 128gb is necessary. Certainly right now there aren't enough games to justify it, but that may change going forward. It's nice to have the extra space but I'd just get whatever is available if they are still hard to get.

My first real VR experience and I'm blown away

This system has been used almost nonstop since getting it. We LOVE it. It's been the centerpiece of visits to my home for the past few weeks. The rest of this review is by my son, who has more gaming experience:The Oculus Quest is a great system. I was excited to try it out, having tried the Oculus Rift in the past. The claims that were made with the Quest were almost unbelievable. Complete VR experience without needing to be tethered to a medium/high-end gaming PC for only $500, with over 3 hours of battery life, higher resolution display, an all in one portable package.After trying the Quest, I can say that it does live up to those claims. The portability is amazing, the display is gorgeous, and I felt no difference between the performance of this and the Rift.The SetupSetup was a breeze, you connect to the Oculus app and power on the system. Pairing to Bluetooth takes a few seconds, and then you’re good to go. Unlike the Rift, the Quest does not depend on external cameras or other hardware to track your movements. The setup for the boundaries includes using the passthrough cameras to “draw” your boundaries in the room. The best thing about this feature that your play space does not have to be a perfect rectangle like with other VR headsets. I use a circular play space that juts in a bit for a coffee table that is in the way. This keeps me from bumping my leg on the table. I could move the table, but this allows me to hop in and out of games without rearranging the furniture.The AppThe Oculus App is functional and works well for its intended purposes. The app has few extra features to speak of. This is the main way to make store purchases, and the games are seamlessly added to the Quest and start downloading, so you can make purchases while you’re away from the system. The app does allow you to stream what is being displayed on the headset, but I haven’t had much success with that, the frame rates are very low.The GamesI have only purchased three games so far. Beat Saber, Vader Immortal and Job Simulator.Although, this review as a whole isn’t focused on the games, I will mention each of them briefly because games can make or break new gaming systems.Beat Saber (30$) is a fast-paced game that draws the player in with musical rhythms and has a lot of replayability. The developer for this game is releasing support for custom songs, which will infinitely increase the number of songs due to player created custom content. This is a feature that will make the game the exact same as the Steam version.Vader Immortal (10$) is the first installment of an episodic game that instantly drew me in with stunning Star Wars visuals, and even though the storyline was a bit lacking, there was a stupid grin on my face the whole time from wielding a lightsaber and blocking blaster fire.Job Simulator (20$) was an equally interesting game, but the thing that brought me into this game was the functionality with the Quest. This game relies on the intricate movements of your hands which is almost perfectly shown with the accuracy of the Oculus Touch controllers. This dorky game has captured many of my hours, and each time I’m surprised with how fluid it feels.I’ve played both Beat Saber and Job Simulator on the Rift, and there were no differences that I noticed between the two.The last thing I want to mention is the YouTube App in this system, even though the content on YouTube is nothing that Oculus has control over, it is a massive part of this system for me. The 360 videos on YouTube never cease to amaze me. Watching a video of Notre Dame before it was burned, or even a guided tour through Rome, the value that is added to this system from YouTube alone is amazing. My grandmother tried it out and is buying one for herself just for the YouTube tours.

I have a Vive and Windows Mixed Reality headset, but now this is the one I bring everywhere with me.If you want to be able to pull out your headset and get into a VR title in under a minute absolutely anywhere, this is the solution. No wires whatsoever. The headset has speakers built in that ""just work,"" while allowing the option for normal wired headphones as well.The operating system is surprisingly snappy, with nothing taking more than a few seconds to completely load, and everything is intuitive. The headsets more comfortable than the Vive but not amazingly so, and the nose gap that you can see out of is annoying at first, but helps when you're trying to figure out what's going on in the real world.The screen door effect is almost nonexistent and the low refresh rate of 72Hz does seem to be slightly more nauseating than basically every other headset out there, but it still feels smooth. The tracking goes out a little bit if you put your controllers behind your back and can cause you to miss blocks in Beat Saber, for instance, but that's the only time I've ran into any issues.The biggest downside is this headset not running as a normal x86 operating system, meaning every game has to be made for this headset/architecture. With this headset being brand new, there's not too many titles out right now, and the ones that are out are pretty expensive (Beat Saber is $30 right now). I'm hoping this will change in the future, but right now you'll be paying the early adopter tax. It'd also be nice if you could use the USB-C port to connect to a computer for the full VR experience, but as of right now that isn't even planned. I'd also like to see the controllers powered by internal rechargeable batteries rather than AAs, but after several full battery-draining sessions, they're still at 90%, so it's not a big issue.There's the unsupported option to load games onto the headset straight from a computer (including allowing desktop VR streaming over WiFi), and while I haven't tested them myself yet, I am very glad that the option is there so you aren't completely locked into the Oculus/Facebook ecosystem permanently.In the end, I can't not recommend this for what it is. For the best tethered room-scale VR, the next Vive is what you'll want. But if you want something you can set up in seconds anywhere, this can't be beat.

The easiest room-scale VR to get into yet

My first thought upon first powering up the Headset and going through the intro was ""Are you kidding me??!!""I have had some experience with the PS4 VR as well as earlier VR systems, and I thought those were great, but after using the Quest for only a day, those previous units are destined to collect dust in a cabinet somewhere.  This system is generations beyond those previous systems!Being able to delineate a play area, after which the system will warn you when you are approaching area limits, is fantastic. You can either set for an open area of a room, or select stationary use for sitting in a chair.Resolution is very good...in fact so good that I've been afraid of ""bumping"" into a non-existent table or wall!The intros, active tutorial, and demos are superb. Working with the hand-controls is quickly intuitive and easy.  Sound is not overpowering and has sufficient volume control.The headset out of the box needs to be adjusted for your head. I found that adjusting the top strap to position the bottom strap to the lower part of the back of your head really improves comfort and strain.Charging is easy and relatively quick. Full charge for me provided more than 2-hours of constant use. The hand controls use AA batteries and I have not yet had to change them, so I don't know how long those will last before battery replacement.I don't quite have the right words to express how fantastic this system is. I can only say it well-deserves a STRONG Five Star rating, and I can honestly and very heartily recommend the Quest.  Expect to immerse yourself into an entirely extraordinary experience!! A+++

I am totally amazed at the image quality in this Oculus Quest All-in-one VR Gaming Headset.  Setup takes only a short time, starting with downloading the Oculus app.  The system is not so light but comfortable enough for hours of playing.Having fallen in love with it immediately, I bought several five-star rating games to try out and couldn't put it down.  The only thing that's hindering me is that the battery lasts only about two and a half hours after each charge.  I can attach an external battery pack that I use for cellphones to power it to continue to play without a string attached.The sound is loud and clear and immersive.  Someone complained about not having an in-ear headphone to maximize the enjoyment of sound, but I prefer the current setup that allows me to hear the room sound in case someone needs to warn me or give me instructions.The unit is also well made with durable material and construction.I recommend it!

Some people have complained about the weight of this headset, but so far it's been pretty comfortable for 2-hour gaming sessions.This is a wireless VR headset, so everything is onboard---and that's why it's a little heavy. The games are stored in memory in the headset itself, and capacity isn't upgradeable. Keep that in mind when you are making a decision between the 64 and 128GB model.Setup is easy. You will need a phone to download and use the app for setup and to get games. Then follow the instructions and in minutes you're ready to play.Graphics aren't going to rival PC or console games---they're a little bit retro in terms of resolution, but that kind of comes with the territory and the small built-in screens in the headset. Besides, that might be a good thing when it comes to VR. If the the graphics are too good, things might get a little ""uncanny valley"" and not so fun to play for long. That's not a complaint, just a personal opinion.The wirelessness is a huge convenience during gameplay---you won't feel a cord brushing against your arms or running down your back. And the controllers are responsive with no noticeable lag. Battery life is good enough for a several-hours-long gaming session.Game availability is coming around, but isn't really vast yet. Maybe the prices of games will come down as more are brought to market.

It wasn't until I saw there was a Quest 2 that I remembered I never reviewed this. I had great hopes for the Quest when it was offered to me for review via Amazon Vine.  However, it was not a marriage made in heaven.  I was never able to get it to fit correctly.  There was a gap on the lower side that let in way too much light. Too distracting to enjoy the product.  Tried the piece for those who wear glasses (like me) to no avail.  Tried making other adaptations but could not escape the light leak on one side.  Also tried using the Quest in a dark room, but couldn't get the hang of it.  So I've  abandoned VR for now, waiting for some other firm factor to come along.  In the meanwhile, your mileage may vary.

My son absolutely could not BELIEVE when I told him that this was on the way, which was in a way a mistake because it arrived while we were gone for Memorial Day Weekend. But once he came back it is everything that I can do to tear it off his head. I am only relieved by the cool boundaries of play he is able to set for himself within the reality of the stunning graphics and immersion, otherwise he would probably wander off and get hit by a bus.  LOLThis is the first time I've experienced VR and I was just as astonished as he was - I loooooved being inside a world that was impressively real with all the tools I needed for ""survival"" right at my fingertips. The headset itself was a big cumbersome for me at times, but my son absolutely loves it. This is a true treat to yourself if you love gaming and one that will only get better as the selection and graphics improve at the light speed of technology. This is simply AMAZING.

Ok. I don't get excited about video game's that often--I'm not a HUGE gamer; more of a novice gamer--But this thing is OUTSTANDING! The whole experience is quite fluid and is way too much fun! The headset and controllers are very well built and operate perfectly. The synergy is unreal.  I LOVE that you can set a safety zone to keep from running into things.Battery life is decent, but not overly outstanding. This is totally understandable, as you can only put so much battery in ti without it being overly heavy. It's already a bit porky, but still wearable.It had a very weird smell when first removed from the package that was concerning, but has since faded. I can't describe the smell, but believe it was the glue that holds the face gasket to the headset.All-in-all, a bit expensive, but SO worth the money!

I was surprised at how easy this was to set up. I had it configured and learned the basics in about 15 minutes. The only time I felt any dizziness was when I was setting up the ""safe area"". You draw a virtual line around yourself, and the headset will warn you if you start to move outside it so you don't walk into walls or fall over the furniture. While you're doing that it shows a ""ghost"" view of your room, and that was a bit weird.Aside from that, the Quest was pretty simple to set up and use. It will take a while to learn the controls until they feel natural. And it will be interesting to see how confused I get when switching between the Quest and my Microsoft HoloLens!I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of apps and games come out for the Quest.

I was a day-one adopter of the Rift, and I still love the variety and quality of games it can play, but ultimately the combination of the lighthouses (especially their USB drain) and the tether made it so cumbersome that it wasn't worth the effort to set everything up when I wanted to play.The Quest is the exact opposite. I plop it on my head, quickly draw out a play area with the controller, and I'm good to go. That, plus the freedom of not having to worry about a tether, is well worth the sacrifice of a little bit of visual complexity. At the end of the day, gameplay matters more to me than graphics, and the convenience factor of the Quest significantly improves the gameplay experience.Comfort isn't perfect, with the Quest exerting more pressure on my cheeks than I would like. I suspect a VR cover might help.  Adding an external battery as a counterweight (I used the Anker battery designed for the Switch and attached it to the back of the strap with Velcro) did help significantly. It's also worth it to make certain you have the strap placed properly on your head (lower than is intuitive for most folks). Having someone hold the headset in place while you get it ""just right"" can help hear. The glasses insert works great, and it's a relief not having to pop in my contacts every time I want to play.Keep in mind that the Quest does not have integrated headphones, something the people around you will realize immediately. I found over-the-ear cans the most comfortable solution, but Oculus also makes pricey, proprietary earbuds if you prefer.There are already plenty of titles to keep you occupied at launch, with Beat Saber being the obvious crowd favorite for novice and experienced gamers alike. Vader Immortal, while short, is a breathtaking immersion into the Star Wars universe, and a must-buy for fans of the series.I think the Quest represents the future of virtual reality. It's a standalone device that is accessible to players of any age. It performs well and intuitively, without many hiccups, and already has a number of title behind it. I'm certain that, as with any tech, the second generation will be even flashier, but there's really no reason to wait. There's plenty of fun to be had right now.
