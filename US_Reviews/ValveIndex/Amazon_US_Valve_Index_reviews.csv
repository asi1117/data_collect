I have bought 4 light houses. The first one went red after only two days, the second one went red after one and a half weeks, and the third (this one) has gone red after 5 months. The problem is the indicator light has gone red and will no longer sync up.Update 01/01/2020I wanted to add another comment about the light houses.  I had previously bought the HTC VIVE and used it for over a year.  The VIVE lighthouses were continuously plugged in 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  They never made a sound and never went out.  But the Valve lighthouses whine like a small speed motor and add noticeable background noise that is not bad but is there none the less.  And  the plastic lenses in the Valve are not as good as the glass lenses I replaced in the VIVE.  And while we are at it, the Valve headset does have a glare problem as previously stated by many other people and a fairly small 'sweet spot' for focusing (at least compared to the optical lens replacement in the VIVE).

For the time this product came out, it was an excellent product in terms of specs and performance (industry leading refresh rate and sound.) The problem is that the quality control is severely lacking, and their proprietary replacements are both expensive and straight up out of stock.As of right now, my cable seems to be bad after under 100 hours of use. Valve offers zero phone support, and I had to navigate my way through a maze of self-help options to find the actual support link. As of right now, I've not had any response in over a day and the replacement cable I need is sold out (and the ONE other seller that sells them other than Valve is sold out as well).So I now have a very expensive paperweight, and nobody to talk to from Valve about that. I just have to wait around for them to respond, create an RMA, and then slowly mail a replacement out. I'm out of warranty, though which is only a SINGLE YEAR, so I may be completely out of luck. The replacement cable, which may take weeks or months to come in stock, is also $130 (from Valve, OR from the third party, it's all the same price).So yeah... I full-heartedly recommend the Valve Pro instead of this product. It has better resolution, 120hz refresh rate, and live chat that will give you faster support. Don't waste your money on an Index.

The Valve Index kits listed here on Amazon as of Aug 2020 are extremely overpriced. They can be purchased directly from the manufacturer (Valve) for $999.  There is a waiting list when purchasing directly from Valve, but the savings would definitely make it worth it.The Valve Index is an AMAZING VR experience, an absolute must-have. It's very comfortable, albeit a little heavier than most HMDs I've used. The hardware IPD adjustment works wonderfully, and the lenses can be adjusted forward/backward too to increase/decrease FOV. Just don't get ripped off when buying one -- buy from Valve.

So it true I don't have the Valve Index, only the Oculus Rift and the Oculus Rift S.  However this is not a review about the Valve Index.  It's about the price that is being charged. Which many of the reviews have been evaluating. It is so NICE to see that there are suppliers who are WILLING to make this product available for CONSUMERS who really need and want it and can AFFORD it.  If there was no mechanism to allow suppliers to charge over the manufactures SUGGESTED retail price, these devices would not be available on Amazon (or probably any other online retailer).  Perhaps a solution to all the people who perhaps can't afford more than the SUGGESTED price would be for Valve to price their product at, oh maybe, $4,999.99.  Yes, make the MSRP $4,999.99!  Now if one sees a ""discounted""  price of say, $3,500 or $1,200 or even $1000; the product (in this instance, the Valve Index) would be reviewed on the quality, durability, function, etc of the device and not on the basis of how far the price varies (upwards) from the MSRP.  Look I can't afford a Maserati (at least not a brand new one).  If I were to rate it do I give it a low rating because I think it too expensive?  Maybe.  But I should state, this car sucks BECAUSE I can purchase a 2020 Chevrolet Spark for a small fraction of the price of a Maserati and it will get from point A to point B, although not perhaps as fast a Maserati.  Clearly in NYC traffic the Spark might be just as fast as the Maserati.  Yeah, I can't afford a new Maserati (at least not the GranTurismo Coupe), but it's nice to know that if I was in a big hurry (I'm not) I could afford the Valve Index today.  This review was written at a time where the price was listed as Less than $3000 but More than $2000.

Its a scalp item what I'm meaning by this is there buying it from steam for 1,000 dollars and flipping it for more then the msrp2. the valve index can be purchase on steam for much cheaper and you get an 1 year warranty witch they don't say there warranty3. it will be easier if you bought it directly from steam for replacement parts and warrantyin the end its not worth it to buy an valve index on here for anything other than the asking price even use its going for more then the msrp witch you can by on eBay for much cheaper then on here don't give your money to this company its an bad idea and its not worth dealing with the bull that this drop shipper will do if I could give it an 0 I would please amazon  take all these listings down so people don't get scam by scalpers

I waited over 2 months for my initial order of the full kit directly from Valve. I do like the setup but only 2 weeks after having it, and with what I consider limited use, the left controller started sticking in the up position. Of course this is under warranty but rather than cross ship me a new control so Im not waiting even more, I have to send it in, wait for it to be checked and then they will send out a replacement.  They should offer a cross ship option where a hold is placed on your card, a replacement sent, and once the defective item is received they refund or release the hold.

I received my valve index on 3/22 as part of the batch of shipments that became available on 3/09.  After playing VR for an hour, you really lose sense of the real world.  I still feel like I'm in a game as I type this.Half Life Alyx came out on 3/23.  I've spent 3 hours playing the game so far and it is incredible.  So much attention to detail, so much immersion.  It's ironically the perfect game to play during Covid-19 quarantine.Running the Valve index on an RTX 2080 in a 10ft x 10ft space.  Everything is perfect.

I bought via Steam for $999, not from Amazon for $1600.  But I don't see anywhere to leave a review for it in Steam, so here I am.The headset is SMALL.  If you have a big head, you will be in pain within 30 minutes of putting it on.  It does not seal to my face AT ALL.  I lasted an hour before I had to quit from the pain.  The IPD is also quite limited.As for the actual in-game experience... honestly, it's like playing flat with head tilts.

INDEX  IS  AWSOME  BEST VR I HAVE PLAYED OWN RIFT S AN QUEST  I STILL BOUGHT  INDEX  SO WORTH IT
"
2022-05-23 14:50:48.209863,"
I got the Rift S then sold it to get the Index thinking it would be better, mainly to play DCS. The resolution at the center is about  the same, but the Rift S resolution falls off slightly faster than the Index towards the edges. Overall I think the difference in image quality is negligible between the two and the tracking on the Rift S is better than the tracking on the Index. The Rift S hardly ever looses tracking, but if the Index loses view of the base stations it loses tracking. It's very difficult to hit switches on the consoles, or look behind you in DCS with just two base stations.  Also there is the additional setup required in placing the base stations, more wires, the Index is just a more complicated experience for a minor improvement in image quality, even if they were the same price I would still choose the Rift S. Finally because the base stations have moving parts they are more likely to fail than any other electronic device. I've had to RMA two of them so far.

Buy this product directly from Steam.  Goes for around $1000 (and comes with a free bonus game).  You may need to stand in the line as of today (Dec2020). However, if something goes wrong, Steam tech support will help you without asking any questions (and you may need it).  5 stars to the Steam team and this product.

初めてのVRでしたが貯金に余裕あったので購入。ブレード&ソーサリーとonwardをプレイしています。5本指ちゃんと動きますよ！倒した敵に中指立てたりウイッシュしたりできるので楽しいです！（onwardではやりませんが笑）初VRだからか、ありえないくらいのリアリティに驚愕しました。画質もいい感じです。音は横のヘッドホン…と、いうよりはスピーカーから聞こえてきます。音質もいい感じだと思いますよ。耳に触れることがないので蒸れたり痒くなったりはないです。ただ、そのせいで音漏れがするので…その…えっ…エッチなゲームしたかったらやめときましょう…うん…自分は平均より頭がデカイ上にメガネまでかけているのですが、その場合はメガネを先にゴーグルの中に入れてから頭をはめると装着しやすいかもです。ちなみにこのセットに含まれているトラッカー（で、合ってる…？）を含めて、全部でコンセントが5つ必要です。（PC本体、モニター、トラッカー×2 &、VRゴーグル）自分機械音痴の呪いがかかってるので「VRってPCにUSBだけ繋げばいいんじゃないの？」って思ってたんですが、モニターと同じように特殊なケーブル（名前わからん…アシンメトリーなHDMIみたいな形してる）とオーディオ用のUSBをPCに接続して、なおかつコンセントにプラグを刺すって感じですね。部屋のコンセント4つだったんですが、トラッカーだけ延長コードにタコ足で付けたのでちゃんと遊べました。唯一がっかりした点は…そう、このセット一番の目玉となるコントローラーです。他の方は「電源ボタンの位置が悪い」とおっしゃっていますが、正直電源なんてついちゃえばどうってことないので、そこはさほど気にしなくていいです。慣れれば手元見なくても押せます。それ以上に厄介なのが、先程べた褒めした5本指のセンサーなのです。何がだめなのか。それは「かなり手汗に弱い」という点です。このセンサー、結構繊細なんですよ。親指と人差し指はボタン操作なのですが、中指、薬指、小指のセンサーがPS4コントローラーのタッチパッドみたいになってるんですよ。で、自分みたいに手汗をかきやすい人が使っていると、その手汗にセンサーが反応しているのか、手を離しているのに「掴んでいる判定」になってしまうんです。これの何が困るのかというと、たとえばonward(オンラインの戦争ゲーム)だと、敵との戦闘中に弾切れを起こしリロードをしなきゃいけないときに、銃を支えている左手が銃にひっついてしまいマガジンを取れなかったり、マップ代わりのタブレット端末などの攻撃できないアイテムを持ってる時に近くに後ろを向いてる敵を見つけても、アイテムをしまう事ができないため武器を取り出せずチャンスを逃したり、手榴弾を投げようとしたら手をパーにして腕振り回してるのにずっと握ったままで、そのまま自爆しちゃったり…ということが起きます笑Beat Saberのような握りっぱなしでも良いゲームなら問題は無いかもですが、道具をあれこれ持ち替えるタイプのゲームは別のコントローラーを使ったほうがいいですね…

ゲーム内でボタンではなく、手で物をつかめるこの体験をするためだけに13万払えるかどうかが、このおもちゃを買うかどうかの基準になると思う。ただ初めてゲームに触れた時やPS、PS2、PS3、PS4が出た時の様な感動と驚きを与えてくれる事は保証できる。フルトラッキングにするために追加で4万、十分な部屋の広さを確保する為に引っ越しで+α払って設備を万全な体制を整えたくなる位の魅力が詰まってる。いつか遠くない未来、本体からケーブルが消えて、軽くなって、外付けのトラッカーがなくなって、頭につけるやつ一つ、もしかしたら身一つでプレイできるようになるとは思うけど、早いうちから体験して置いたほうが色々多くを楽しめるんじゃないかなと思う。VR老人会開催時に、昔を懐かしむためにも今から参入を。

確かに映像は良いですがベースステーションに問題があります。36万円のエイリアンデスクトップを使ってもベースステーションに問題があると画面が真っ白で使い物になりません。steam社はVRを販売すべきではないと思います。レビューの高さに騙されてはいけません。テクノロジーではmetaが一番です。コントローラも認識しませんでしたし、なぜこのVRの評価が高いのか理解に苦しみます。ベースステーションを壁に穴を開けて設置できる人がどれだけいるんでしょうか？本当に残念な思いをしました。
