For the love of God, do NOT buy this kit from Amazon. It’s $500 cheaper on Steam, doesn’t have a waitlist anymore, and comes with Half-Life Alyx as well. The Amazon listings are from unauthorized scalper scumbags peddling likely used kits for way above reasonable prices.

Well here's the thing it was good for like 3 days and then it quit working for my pc. It would work and then quit ...work and then quit...and then all of a sudden no more. So i gave it to my friend in germany instead.

Bought this for my son for Christmas and it stopped working less than 24 hours later. I even had my son’s gaming computer looked at. They said it was the VR set. I returned it and found it on steam for way way cheaper!

Don't buy this scalper junk. It's the same kit being sold for nearly double the price directly from the manufacturer, Valve.

The Valve Index full VR kit is the best VR experience you can buy, as of this writing, even better than the $1400 HTC Vive Pro 2. The quality and specifications of this product make it worth buying. While you prefer a wireless solution (and I think you CAN buy add-on that can convert this to wireless, you can't beat this is if you want the best.The problem here is not the item itself, but the people selling it. The retail price for this item is $999, from Valve itself. If you're buying this new, and see prices higher than this, they're scalping you. If you're buying this USED and paying this much or more, it's not worth it. Don't get ripped off, save some money, get the free game Half Life: Alyx, and all the protections of buying from a reputable seller, buy buying this item directly from Steam.If you're not going to buy this item from the source, you are taking a large risk with your money, you can be getting it used, refurbished, broken, missing parts, and the BEST case you can hope for is to get a perfect unit that's WAY over-priced.

The Valve Index is a fantastic, lightweight, easy to use and easy to setup virtual reality headset. That being said, it costs $800 less if you buy it from Valve. Do not buy this from Amazon, they are ripping you off.

The Index is amazing, but buy it directly off of Steam for $999, and it's a brand new 2022 version, as well.  Instead of two years old.  Do NOT buy this for this price.  This vendor is trying to scam you.

The valve index is a great thing but get it from steam because it’s a lot cheaper you get half life Alyx for free and if you brake something you get a free replacement for 2 years
