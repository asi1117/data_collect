I bought this through the website as they had a sale at the time, but wanted to write a review as I use them all the time to understand the opinions of others. I bought this mainly for sim racing and flying, so only one base station would be needed, but there was a kit that provided 2 and 2 controllers so I can play other games as well with it which was worth it. The headset itself comes with a pretty long cable and to set it up I had to update the firmware. I work on computers a lot so it wasn't too difficult at all and the support you get is really helpful because I did use them to make sure that I was downloading the correct file.This headset does require a pretty heft computer though. I have a 6900xt, and that still has trouble running everything at native resolution and at 90fps. But honestly, this just depends more on your equipment, and running the game settings lower really doesn't make it that bad, but you can get some great picture out of it if you spend some time getting it right and going over forums and things to see what others have done for each game.Honestly, this headset with the wide-angle view is beyond worth it. When I am racing online you can clearly see the mirrors without having to turn your head all the time, and it helps a ton more trying to make sure you don't get into any accidents. I come from a Rift S to start off with though and that still bugs me how I can see a lot of black on the sides.

I own a 5K+ but I had the opportunity to try one of these and it was just jaw dropping. The resolution and clarity are phenomenal. If you've tried something like Aircar on headsets like a Rift, Quest, and even an Index, what you saw in all of those is just mediocre entry-level stuff compared to this headset. Pimax has really pushed the value of this headset high with their updates supporting a higher refresh rate. Even with their 12K model coming up, this is well worth it since you'll be able to trade it in for a full credit towards the 12K.

Ich habe die VR Brille korrekt installiert. Leider wurde keine Verbindung hergestellt. Der Support am Telefon hat mich an eine E-Mail-Adresse verwiesen und seitdem habe ich nichts mehr gehört. Auf der Internetseite wird auch ein WhatsApp Support Telefon und E-Mail Kontakt angeboten. Leider meldet sich nach vier Tagen einfach niemand auf allen Kanälen.Ich bin von dem Produkt sehr enttäuscht und genervt. Besser nach einer Alternative schauen!

Sorry my English, it's not my native language.As a previous (and still!) owner of the (excellent) HTC Vive Pro (and, before it, of the original Vive), I fell that I wanted more FOV and, if possible, less SDE in the VR experience. Of course, the most appealing offer out there it was this Pimax 8KX! But with so many bad personal reviews on this same internet page, I was a little afraid to buy this VR headset.After a carefully reading of many of this  bad opinions, I found that a lot of then it were from people that didn't have carefully tuned this VR headset to their own eyes (more about this later!). And, worst, far worst!, it was the feeling that there were also bad opinions that came from what appear to be just people who can't afford to really buy such an expensive VR headset, so order it anyway, use it in the experimental first 15 days, return it and then came where talking that they had returned it because it was a bad VR headset. Maybe I'm wrong about this feeling, but... I still have it!First, 3 important things!1 - If you have a previous VR headset, disconnect it (only the VR headset, not the base stations!) from your computer, before you connect and set up the Pimax 8KX. Don't do this, and you probably will have many future problems (Pitool crashing without reason, the headset doesn't show any image, no sound in the headset speakers, etc, etc...). Disconnect your previous VR headset. You have been warned!2 - Also, in Windows, go to the properties of your computer USB ports and turn off the save energy options (Windows usually have it turned on)! This VR headset always needs a lot of energy!3 - And, very, very important!, you need to know your IPD ( Interpupillary distance) AND the distance from both of your pupils to the centre of your nose! This last measurement is maybe the primary reason why so many people don't feel OK with this VR headset. The problem is that not everyone has a symmetrical face, and so many times the distance from one pupil to the vertical axle of the nose it's not the same as the other pupil!. My left pupil is at 33,5 mm from the vertical axle of my (big) nose and my right pupil is just at 27,5mm! Yes, my nose it's tilted to the right side of my face. So, if I put on this (or any other) VR headset and only adjust the IPD in the Pimax 8KX button at its right lower corner, I will still have my pupils out of the lenses focus! That's why there is an option on the Pitool where you need to enter your IPD offset. With that, Pitool will change the best image focus of each lenses to the position of each of your pupils! Don't care about this (an oculist can measure your IPD offset) and you will be lucky if you get a good image quality through the lenses, because very few people have a perfect symmetrical face.The good about this VR headset:1 - It feels natural! The image has not a so strong 3D effect as it has the HTC Vive Pro (the lenses overlap of this last one it's just the best in the VR headsets!), but also has not a perspective view so closed, and I think that's one of the reason the image fell so natural, without eyes strain, on the Pimax 8KX.2 - And the big FOV, of course! Get use to it, and you will not want to return to look at a view of the world through a scuba mask again, as you do when you look through another VR headset.3 - It's heavy, but doesn't fell really heavy! I have a big head and I fell comfortable with it. However, if you have a small head and especially a narrow face, you could feel it not the most comfortable VR headset out there.4 - Not a hot VR headset! I fell a lot more hot with the HTC Vive Pro.5 - Far less God rays, one of the flaws of my HTC Vive Pro.And the bad things are...1 - LCD screens! Man, I wanted to cry when I saw for the first time through LCD screens on a VR headset! I was costumed to the OLED screens and to pass to the LCD screens, with far less contrast, without the wonderful and vibrant colours of the OLED screens... It hurts, it really hurts! Another very important thing, that almost no one talks, it's that OLED screens are very, very fast, and after almost 4 years of use of the HTC Vive Pro, I fell that the response time of the LCD screens are good, but not at all as good as the OLED screens! It's almost the difference you feel in response time from an old CRT monitor to the actual LCD screens. I hope in future all VR headset will return to the OLED screens (but with less SDE)!2 - As the front of this VR headset is very large, I fell that the back cushion it's not enough! It needs some lateral cushions to make it fell a little more stable.3 - The sound it's not the best, but you get costumed with it. There is too much bass inside the midrange. Far less bass (what an obsession to put so bass in the modern headsets!) and a better midrange, it will be nice!4 - The price! Yes, it's expensive! But, hey, so many people buy more expensive smartphones and this VR headset offers much more (in my opinion!).5 - And last, but not least,  it requires a very power CPU, with an RTX 3080 or a superior graphics card! I have an RTX 3090 and in some games it struggles to feed this Pimax 8KX.No, it's not the perfect VR headset, but it's a good one (in my opinion).A final note! If you have an old HTC Vive Pro and you don't fell the need of bigger FOV, don't buy this Pimax 8KX and NOT ANY OTHER VR headset yet! The HTV Vive Pro it's still a wonderful VR headset, with its OLED screens, even with the slight annoying SDE.

Nachdem meine VR Erfahrung schon einige Headset's beinhaltet, die letzte war die Pimax 8k+, wollte ich die maximale Bildqualität mit Field of View erzielen, damit hat es nur die Pimax 8kx für mich gegeben.Wenn man sich erst mal durch die ganzen Foren und Einstellungen gearbeitet hat, ist die Qualität von dem Bild um einiges besser als von der 8k+. Man sollte aber daran denken das man wirklich einen sehr guten PC dazu benötigt!Bemängeln würde ich das Kabel was ein wenig  zu kurz und durch die 2 USB Anschlüsse die Brille immer mit Strom versorgen, auch wenn der PC ausgeschaltet ist (außer man ändert die USB Einstellungen das sie stromlos werden).Mein Fazit zur Brille ist, wenn man es geschaft hat alles richtig zu konfigurieren und das dauert eine Weile, hat man sicher eine VR-Brille die begeistern kann.

Péssimo, isto nem 4k é! Muito mau mesmo! Imagem deslavada muito shimmering/aliasing. Mesmo com mais supersample. Fov bom de resto tudo negativo! Lentes com lixo interno como podem ver na imagem além que as próprias lentes estão riscadas. Isto é uma vergonha! Até na fotografia podem ver a imagem esbatida branco esbatido. É mesmo mau.
