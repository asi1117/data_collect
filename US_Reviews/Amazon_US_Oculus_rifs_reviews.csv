* Edited 2020-Sep-05 *As of Oct 1, 2020 a Facebook account will be required to use this hardware.  Existing users have until Jan1, 2023 to covert to Facebook or the bulk of features will not be available and titles may not work at all.  AVOID this hardware and company and go with a Vive or other VR option.  I for one, will not continue to use this product.  It’s a plain and simple spyware campaign that Facebook continues to expand and is now trying to force upon all users of the Oculus line.  As a long time Oculus user, I find this repulsive and will not support this type of corporate behavior.  Rating reduced to one star because zero stars are not possible...* Edited 2019-Jun-02 - marked by ** - **I've used Oculus headsets since the first beta before Facebook owned it.  This headset promises to be the first step in making VR accessible to the PC masses.  It uses a single connection, no external sensors, and is plug and play (in theory).The graphics are a slight step up from the last iteration, noticeable, but not massive.  The controllers are likewise a slight step up from the previous generation and very easy to adapt to.The new see through cameras and guardian system works very well.  If you are new to Oculus, this is a visual barrier to let you know when you are going to run into things in the 'real world'.  With the headset on, you see a camera view of the real world.  You trace out your play area with a 'laser' and this defines your play space, surrounded by virtual walls.  The setup is easy and intuitive.Responsiveness is great and much better than single or dual sensor tracking of old.  There is no break in the motion when a sensor loses sight of the headset because this headset tracks from the inside out using cameras placed all around the headset.Also gone is the glare from the lenses.  Bright scenes had no glare around the edges (halo) like the last set.  Colors were good and vibrant.  **In dark scenes the LCD panel shows its weakness with washed out blacks (more like grey than black).  In dark scenes it is very hard to distinguish items due to a lack of contrast.  When playing Arizona Sunshine as a test, I knew the area and still couldn't see things in the dark with a flashlight.  Unlike the last panel, this severe lack of contrast and black level is a strong drawback from OLED panels for space sims (Elite Dangerous, etc.) or shooters i where there will be a lot of dark areas.**** The lenses don't steam up as fast as the old units although I do notice that my face is much more 'sealed' to the front of the unit.  This is good and bad (for me).  It is good in that it seals out light almost entirely.  However, I used to cheat and look through the gaps by my nose to see the keyboard, etc., in the past.  Now I have to physically lift the unit to find the keyboard, etc.  It should be noted that I use my Oculus more for seated gaming (Elite, Project Cars, Assetto Corsa, etc.) than standing games.  When playing standing games with the touch controllers the better seal would be preferred.  If you want to peek into the 'real world' you can double tap the Oculus button on the touch controller to enable the cameras.  This works well, and is thoughtful, for situations when you are spinning around shooting zombies and become entangled in your headset cord. **** The built in sound is very weak with no bass.  A canon shot sounds like a 'tink' rather than a 'boom' in War Thunder for example.  The headset uses directional sound from the strap to direct sound down towards your ears.  Unlike the last version, headphones will not fit over the straps on this version.  While it does include a built in microphone, I prefer using a noise canceling headset for gaming that also provides a richer sound (for seated play).  This design simply does not allow for that.  The sponge on the strap sides (used for comfort) create a 3/4-1"" (20-25 mm) offset, on each side, that hold the headphone arms (and ear pads) away from your head.  This applies to over the ear, or on ear headphones.  If you use ear buds it won't be a problem.**Speaking of the strap, it works surprisingly well with a single wheel to tighten the unit to your head.  It pulls the headset to your face and there is a release to move the actual lens part (the big box) away from your face.  If you wear glasses, this is far better than the last set.  It is a little harder to get the up-down into focus because the 'box' does not pivot in any way.  All in all, it's a mix of good and bad over the old unit.  Definitely easier to put on, although it goes back to full tight every time it's removed, but harder to get into the sweet spot for focus.  Once in focus, it stays put very well** Note - I raised the rating by 2 stars after getting a replacement and further testing. **So why one star?  Because it doesn't work.  Upon first plugging it in, you will have to update the BIOS on everything (headset and controllers).  Then you go through the VR setup.  First problem was a black screen when instructed to continue the setup in VR.  I unplugged it from one display port and plugged it into another and it started working.  I finished setup and jumped into a game.  After less than 5 minutes in the game, the screen goes black again.  It was still on because I could see the backlight, but no picture and no sound from Oculus home.  I can hear system sounds coming from the headset though.  A reboot later and it's still not working.  Unplug, and re-plug into a new ports and it's still dead as a door knob.  So much for quality control.  The Oculus app shows all green check boxes next to the device, as though all is good when it is definitely not.** I received a replacement from Amazon for another go at this model.  The replacement also crashed during setup, but afterwards has worked so far.  It appears the first one may have had a defective board that once heated, failed.  I am rating this as 3 stars because the increased resolution and reduction in the 'screen door' effect does not overcome the issue with the lack of rich blacks and contrast.  The old panel was better in that regard.  Also the change to the strap, while comfortable, completely negates using superior headsets.  Sound is every bit as important to immersion as the visual elements.  In this regard, the sound in this headset is a big leap backwards.  Convenient yes, but practical no.Performance wise, I have had a chance to run it through some benchmarks.  This headset operates at 80 frames per second (ideally) as opposed to 90 FPS on the last Rift.  On the surface this appears to be worse, but in practice it is not noticeable and did not lead to discomfort at all.  I also noticed that this headset was able to keep up at a full 80 FPS in games that previously would drop to ASW (45 FPS).  ASW is the Oculus method of dynamically creating filling frames when the frame rate drops below ideal.  This helps with discomfort and creates a smoother playback image even through the frame rate is less than the desired 90.  This headset did not drop below 80 in most of my tests using the same settings as the previous unit that would have stayed in ASW with the same settings.  Clearly the unit is better at aiding graphics cards in rendering frames quicker.**I am running a current game rig with an Intel 8700k and an NVidia 1080ti.  Pretty standard fair and one that worked reliably with the old headset.  For $400 and after waiting years for an update, I had hoped that the headsets are intended to last longer than 10 minutes.  I feel like I'm beta testing the original again.  It's clear to me they have a number of kinks to work out.  This one is going back immediately.** After spending some time reviewing the latest drivers, etc., it still seems like an early release, but one that is worthy of $399.The alternative I would consider is the new Vive Index.  However, the Vive is MUCH more expensive at $1,000.  Furthermore, it still requires satellites setup around the room and can suffer from interruptions as a result (it usually works well in practice).  This makes it less portable and more of a pain to switch between seated play and standing play in many situations.  Also the touted 144 FPS refresh rate is highly unlikely in anything but simple whack-a-mole type games (Beat Saber, etc.).  You will need significant hardware (2080, etc.) to push that frame rate.  The controllers on the Vive also seem better (how it is held, finder tracking, etc.), but it isn't yet fully implemented and there are a lot of questions around play with legacy device support.For these reasons, the Oculus seems like the better consumer deal.If you will be playing mostly things like Arizona Sunshine, Beat Saber, etc., this is really a very easy headset to use, and is much easier to setup and put away too. **

The Oculus Rift uses one USB and one HDMI cable, however the Oculus Rift S uses one USB and one displayport cable. So my ""Oculus ready"" laptop can't use the oculus I just spent over $400 on until I hopefully find a way I can get a third party adapter to plug into the type-C since HDMI adapters allegedly don't work for it. If you're thinking of getting this for your laptop, unless you have a displayport or mini-displayport, DO NOT GET THE OCULUS RIFT SUpdate: Got a displayport to USB-C because I found that could potentially work, since displayport to HDMI doesn't. Unfortunately that didn't help and I still am unable to use this $400 sleeping mask for anything else. I reiterate, do not buy this junk

As of day one I tested a bunch of things on the Rift S, and there are a lot of things I like about the Rift S and some that I don't like.Pros so far:- Display is better looking that the original Rift.  - The slight drop in refresh rate hasn't been noticeable at all for me at least.- Out of box face pad is much more comfortable.- Inside out Tracking is great so far. (still need to mess with it more but haven't had any issues.- Throwing items in VR feels much more normal then the original Rfit. (I've noticed that the old method I used of pushing items to throw doesn't often work but a normal throwing motion seems to work great.... I tried this a lot in Super Hot.- (Update 5/24/19) Built in speakers - While not perfect for someone casually playing the built in speakers work well enough to play most games without issue. It sounds like its almost not playing anything for someone outside the headset but for the wearer it perfectly audible. Lacks good base though.Cons:- Ordered a 10ft display port extender and it seems to cause the black display issue that many are reporting.  - Removed the extension cable and haven't experienced it again yet- Halo head band is pretty thick and I feel alot of headsets will have a hard time getting around it. (I use a Man O War and it barely made it over the headset)- The weight distribution feels a bit odd but it is a new headset so it might take some adjusting to. (Not sure if this is really a con yet).- Cable length is a bit shorter than I would like for my play space.Overall I think it was worth the purchase and plan to rack up some hours with the new headset. Ordered a 6ft cable to some testing with and hopefully that will work without black screening. Updates to come! :D

First I want to point out the specs of my desktop, which is a GTX 1080, 8600k, and 16gb of ram.I was a little suspicious at first if the Rift S was actually worth the upgrade coming from the first Rift. This is oculus' first big attempt at Inside-Out tracking, but I have to admit, they nailed it. It isn't as perfect if you had a 3 or 4 sensor setup with the previous Rift, but as long as you aren't shoving your controllers into your face or flinging your arms behind your back, the sensing is almost seamless.Out of the box, which if I can add is a very pleasant unboxing experience, you get the headset itself, two of their newer controllers, batteries and a displayport to minidisplay port adapter, plus some manual and instructions stuff. One of the advantages this has over the rift is how simple it is to get setup. No more time being wasted trying to find the perfect spot and angle for each sensor, and hoping you have enough usb 3.0 ports. All the Rift S requires is displayport and one usb 3.0 port. Once Oculus' software is installed it configures the Rift S very quickly, and the process to setup your guardian boundaries is so much easier.After all the setup is done and got back into the Home, I realized how much better the visuals are. The screen-door effect is practically not visible at all, and text is so much clearer to read. (I'm actually using the virtual desktop screen with the Rift S on while typing this review). I'm pretty sure I cant go back to the original rift without getting sick with the SDE and lower resolution. While the compromise to the higher resolution was going from a 90hz refresh rate to an 80hz refresh rate, the drop is not very noticeable, only if you are really looking for it. As long as you have the hardware to put out those frame rates, I will gladly take the much clearer visuals.I tested out a couple of games, Beatsaber, Echo VR and Superhot. All played excellently and didn't notice any flaws in the tracking or get disoriented with the 80hz.In addition, this headset is waaaaaaaaay more comfortable than the original rift. The knob to tighten/loosen the strap is much easier to use, and I'm even able to fit my glasses without them scratching the lenses, which I didnt have the room to do so in my old rift. It is a little heavier in the front, but it isnt that much noticable.The only negative I have is the audio. I'm not sure why Oculus decided to remove the speakers from the first rift. Those were fantastic and had great quality. The new speakers are hidden on each sides of the strap, so while you are able to hear your surroundings around you, I found it harder at times to be immersed in whatever I was doing, and there is practically very little bass at all, which is a bummer in games like beatsaber. They did include a headphone jack so that you can use your own headphones, but be warned! I get the feeling that most over-ear headphones wont fit properly. I have Hyperx Cloud II's, and they just barely fit. I dont have any earbuds, but i would assume those would work without a problem.All in all the Rift S, in my opinion, is worth it if you are new to VR or even if you had the original consumer rift like I did. Oculus keeps making steps in the right direction and hopefully will get VR to become even more mainstream someday.

 Visually, yes, the S is a nice step up from the CV1... and tracking is now on par. Rift CV1 and Rift S owner here. I'm quite pleased with how Oculus team has been handling this latest Rift offering.THE PROS:• **UPDATE 6/27/2019** - with Oculus’s latest software release, Beta Test Branch 1.39, inside-out tracking issues seem to have been resolved!! With few exceptions, those “hands too close to the headset” and “behind the back” dead-zones are no longer there. I can now use rifles, bows, climb, block hits, push off walls from behind, and sculpt without loss of tracking! Amazing! Way to put those accelerometers to use and tighten up your algorithms Oculus! I couldn’t be happier.• The slight bump in pixel density/clarity might not look like much on paper, but it’s a HUGE relief to my eyes compared to the Rift CV1! Hardly any SDE or god rays. (yes, LCD produces a cleaner, albeit less black-black, image over OLED in VR... who’d a thunk?) That alone prevented me from immediately returning my S, but now that tracking has been addressed, I’ve since shelved my CV1 in favor of the S.• Initial setup of the headset and laying the guardian barrier map is quick and easy. Remember, room scale tracking is accomplished by using the cameras from the headset. If you change your room layout (ie. ya pick up your large dirty clothes piles that were strewn about), you may have to recalibrate depending on the volume of stuff moved. Thankfully, recalibration doesn’t take any major effort or time.• Thank the maker for the passthrough feature! So, with the headset blocking your sense of the outside world… when you get close to a wall or some furniture, a grid fades begins to emerge depending on your proximity to said obstacles. Once you cross a threshold, the S’s Passthrough vision kicks in. This presents the headset wearer with a stitched together granny monochrome view of your environment of reality… from the tracking cameras. It’s not high enough resolution to read anything on a screen, but you can get an idea of what’s on your PC monitor, easily locate & pickup your hand controllers, or move the chair you about fell over.• I prefer the option of using my own quality headphones. Honestly, either one of the Rift’s offerings has gotten me by, but if we’re talking the “best audio” here, a good set of Sennheizer or Bose phones can’t be beat.  6/7/2019 - Oculus released a firmware update to enhance the missing low frequencies on the internal speakers. The sound has improved, but given the choice, I still prefer using my own headphones over either of the CV1’s or S’s built in audio.• The head strap is convenient to use and is quite comfortable. I loosen the tension, slide the headset over my glasses, pull the strap around the back of my head, and reset the tension so it fits nice snug.• I no longer need a 3rd party spacer to extend the lenses away from my glasses that I wear. There is a button on the headset that moves the lenses either closer or farther from my eyes.• The lenses don’t scratch NEARLY as easily as the CV1’s. You’d breath wrong on the original CV1’s and a scratch would about appear, haha. The S’s are not by any means “scratch proof”, but they resist them a lot better than the CV1 lenses.• the complete unit only costs $399! That’s a lotta’ bang for your buck!• Oculus seems to be working to continuously improve on their product. That’s arguably a nice reassurance.THE CONS:• The foam rubber padding around the face isn’t removable from the plastic insert, nor is it what I’d call easily washable. I’ve found saturating the foam with heavily diluted dish soap and blotting it dry with paper towels works best (after removing the plastic insert from the headset, that is). A quick, periodic wipe of isopropyl helps keep the bacteria from taking over further. We MAY someday be able replace the entire plastic insert with its cemented-on foam. Here’s to hope!• The halo head-strap tensioner… idk, I don’t have a tremendous amount of faith in it not wearing out over time. I say this because my welding helmet uses a similar method of tightening the band. Although these industrial straps hold up well, their mechanical tensioners are usually the first parts to fail. Time will tell I suppose.• It’s more convenient to use the poorer Rift audio than to put your own headphones over the headset. In their defense, I’m certain we’ll be seeing an offering that is like the CV1’s earphones. They put that stereo jack there for a reason. Regarding the stereo jack… I would suggest using a 90° connector/tether over one that sticks straight out. I could see it getting hit and cracking the solder joints that keep the jack in place. Once that breaks, you’ll get static or complete loss of the audio signal.THE MOOT (doesn’t affect me personally but may you):• Doesn’t work with HDMI. It says so right on the Oculus site and in the description that it requires a Display Port. No one should be upset about that. If that’s the reason for a poor product review, idk what to tell ya. Perhaps a little research or reading could've saved you the hassle of returning your spontaneous purchase. It comes with a DP>MiniDP adapter. There are reports of a couple DP>USB-C adapters successfully working.• Still gets just as hot under there as any other headset I’ve used. The nonexistent airflow makes my face get sweaty after prolonged use. So, periodic breaks are necessary. Again, make sure you clean the face padding regularly. I can only imagine how nasty it’ll get over time if you don’t... like unwashed undies after mowing the grass kinda’ gross. In any event, I would think twice about “borrowing your friend’s”, hahaha.• IPD adjusting is done via software settings ranging from 54mm to 72mm in fractional 0.5mm increments. My eyes reside about 62.5mm from one another, so I fall well within the allotted midrange. For those whose eyes are spaced differently, and therefore must get closer to the extreme ends of the spectrum, there are reports of problems. The CV1’s method of adjusting IPD was mechanical and moved two lenses to focus on different portions of the two independent screens behind them. The S’s lenses are fixed and has one single screen positioned behind them. Adjusting the IPD setting in software moves the frames on that screen – increasing/decreasing a gap that divides the right and left sides. Because the lenses themselves don’t move, I could see where obtaining a sharp focus on the action may theoretically be a problem for some. Maybe not though. Even if the software IPD settings work for you, swapping between players may have you leaving an app to adjust for Player 2 and returning again for Player 1. That could be annoying.• The controllers are fine. I didn’t break the tracking rings after punching my walls and furnishings like others have reported doing after merely dropping them on a hard floor. So, I’m not seeing where these new controllers differ in quality from the CV1. They feel different (and not in a “this is flimsy plastic” sort of way) and are a fraction smaller... but why wouldn’t that simply be by design? After a couple hours of use, I adapted to the ring location and had no problem reloading rifles,  drawing bows, or aiming pistols. In fact, I can hold a pistol more realistically than I could with the CV1. Weight distribution due to rings being on top vs. wrapping around the bottom? They’re lightweight plastic rings for Pete’s sake. If your wrists feel encumbered from the weight, then the change is a beneficial one for you… as this will only strengthen that area. It’s no PX90, but at least you won’t atrophy away.• Some people complain about the directional audio not living up to its claim. This doesn’t seem to be a hardware issue so much as a software developer thing. Some titles simply could do better with their spherical  360° sound mapping is all. I have no major complaints with the Rift hardware itself in this area. Most titles I use, I can easily tell where the sound is coming from, and I’m hopeful the one’s that aren’t up to speed will improve on that.• The mic? Everyone seems to be able to hear me just fine when I talk. Granted, it’s no RØDE or Sennheiser, but I didn’t expect it to be. It accepts all the sound waves I spew at it just fine. Really people, I know I’m not the only one sporting an S in the games I play. The only time I hear something weird is when someone doesn’t have their mic/headphone levels set correctly... giving us that robotic reverb, annoying feedback, or just cuts out. But that is the case with any headset. You weren’t planning on using it for voice-over work or laying down vocal tracks on your next single, right? Any of you who can tell a major difference in mics... idk what to say. If we’re completely honest, none of these headsets have “amazing audio” hardware, so... take it as you will and let’s get back to focusing on the meat and potatoes.• Direct sunlight can burn the screen and/or harm the cameras (is that any real surprise though?). The lenses are just magnifying glasses…. Think of how those ants felt when ya burnt them under the summer sun. For shame. Again, go to the Oculus site and read up on the product you purchased for details, but the gist of it is, “using it outside at noon is a bad idea”.• Doesn’t function in complete darkness or very well in dim light. Digital cameras require light for the VISUAL SENSORS to detect… light. Meh, so I turn a light on. Good to go. Tracking gets finicky in oversaturated rooms, or those with too many windows and/or mirrors. Some lighting emits a specific frequency (as with SOME fluorescent and lower-end LED lighting) if the pulses phase up to your devices, you may notice some “glitching”. We’ll likely see some improvements in this area as soon as they buckle down exposure parameters.• I let my 9y/o kid play, and the halo doesn’t quite get tight enough without putting a towel back there to take up some slack. Just an FYI for those of you with smaller heads.In conclusion, yeah, I believe the S is enough of a step up to consider it an upgrade, and one that I am happy I made. Will I go so far as to say it’s a 2.0? Well, Oculus has made it a point not to have marketed it as such. But man, after the latest firmware and software upgrades, I’m ALMOST willing to say it could be a Rift 2.0!Processor: Intel i7 4790, RAM: 16 Gig, Video: MSI RTX 2070 Duke, 8 Gig, OS: Windows 10A little prelude (ad the end of the review, haha):My first experience an actual VR headset was in the 90’s with the VFX1. With a resolution of somewhere around 240² per eye, 256 colors at a time, tracking/movement latency, and a frame rate that had us calling it the “tunnel-vision migraine machine”, ANY of today’s headsets are like a dream come true in comparison. These early devices were novel but limited to a handful of playable games like Descent, Quake, and some flight simulator whose title escapes me. Ok until you’d succumb to the headache or crashed your OS… whichever came first.So, although we may be able to pick these current products apart to find their flaws, I’m still thrilled to be able to use any of these devices. They are exponentially more capable and affordable than their pre-2015 predecessors... heck, even our lowest-end cell phone VR rigs have more processing power than the PCs we were tethered to back then.  Depending on one’s level of entitlement, expectation, and/or brand loyalty, you can draw your own conclusions. I’ve given you mine.

I ""upgraded"" from the regular rift and can definetely say it is not worth the upgrade for a few reasons, not just the bugs.1st- The non adjustable ipd makes this thing almost not worth it alone.  It seems like it is made for some kind of horse face.  You have to have a long narrow face.  I actually have a small medium (or ipd 65) head and the lenses are close together making it feel like you are cross eyed even with correct program ipd.  You absolutely feel you got a loss in field of view.  I warn you now.  Unless you are 12 years old this is going to tick you off.  What a failure.2nd-  The inside out tracking works good if you never experienced the tower version.  I can see now that the towers are worth their weight.  If I hold still in a game I can notice that this thing is constantly trying to calculate tracking and there is an ever slight ""wobble"" in the vision.  Don't focus on it too much cuz it will make you feel weird.3rd - Audio is terrible even with headphones.  The speakers built on the sides are useless.  I put in some expensive headphones to find out that the audio quality the oculus was processing was just flat out bad.  It is still tinny and lacks bass.  I tried to find a way to equalize the audio from my pc and have run into road blocks because what seems to be that the because the headphones are in the oculus itself, it is bypassing any fixing I do from the pc. I have been searching for a work around for hours.  What a failure.4th - The pass through vision sucks.  It is black and white and blurry.  No way to stay in that mode and work on stuff.  I was really excited for this feature.  What a failure.5th - The cotrollers are ok but I find myself flip flopping and juggling them all over the place to find the right grip.  I think the old ones were superior as they just fell into your hands the right way.  Might take some time to get used to but feels like a downgradeFinal thoughts :  I have spent 2 days playing with it hoping it would just get better and I would get used to it.  It did not.  It just kept getting worse as new problems would just keep popping up and hopefully I have gone through all of  them.  But that is enough problems to not recommend this to anyone as long as their are other options out there. I will say the screen is a lot sharper but then even that comes with a downside.  With the lcd screen and not oled you immediately notice your blacks are washed out and faded.  From pass through videos I saw of the screen it looked fine and I could be ok with it but it is a lot worse than those videos represented.  I forgot where I read it but I thought I saw that one of the original engineers just up and quit on facebook for this product.  Now I can see why.  I really wanted to like the rift s and tried to make that happen but sadly it did not.  What a failure.

I am so pissed and disappointed. I have waited so long for the headset. I was scared that my IPD would be a problem (I'm 59/60) but I didn't even get to check that. The headset does not work with my new Dell G7 VR ready laptop because it doesnt have a displayport. Most gaming laptops don't have one. I'm not buying any of their product anymore (they already got me on the Oculus Go, which doesnt serve my IPD but mentioned it nowhere and definitely not during my many interactions with customer service).

This headset has exceeded my expectations. The tracking works very well, display is crisp, and its by far the best bang for your VR buck at the moment.  My only minor gripe is the speakers but there's still other options to remedy that. What cracks me up are the 1 star reviews as if they did a bait and switch telling you it has HDMI. Lol. It's advertised as DisplayPort and USB 3.0.  It's your own fault if you bought it not realizing your PC isn't compatible.

First of all, I absolutely love the oculus rift s and have been constantly blown away from the moment I opened the box. Unlike most of the negative reviews on here I actually did my research first (if doing research is reading the description) and realized I need a display port instead of hdmi. For me this is fine, I have a couple DP and HDMI ports on my computer. Great. I ran into an issue where the oculus would crash playing level 1-2 of robot recall but looking online it seems that this has been on ongoing problem with that specific game since oculus rift was out. In any case, the introductory demo blew me away completely. Maybe it's because I'm looking at this product through nostalgia glasses of what I was hoping the future would be like but I am so happy that VR technology is here and my personal experience was that it was absolutely incredible looking at things in VR and just playing around. I just want to stress again that most ""issues"" with this product that people seem to be complaining about seem more like issues with their own laptops or they just didn't read the fine print. After I finish writing this I'm heading right back in to Gun Club VR for some target practice. All in all BUY THIS PRODUCT, it will blow your mind, but DO YOUR RESEARCH, or you might have a sore behind.

Hey guys, let's ""upgrade"" our last product so that only half of the population with the ideal Inter-pupillary distance will be able to use it enjoyably.  What of the rest?  Oh, well they can go **** themselves.Will be returning.

Controllers;different but are the same. They are lighter than the cv1 but are thinner so if playing a fast moving game you will have to grip a little tighter. The straps on the controller feel lower quality but at the same time more comfortable to have on.  The controllers also vibrate at the top instead of the whole controller as well.Resolution/VisualSignificant resolution increase from Oculus Rift Cv1 (you WILL notice you can READ things much EASIER) but LCD instead of OLED, so blacks are a dim grey.Passthrough is a gift from heaven being able to see your room easily without ripping off the headset every time you want to do something!Tracking;Better but also different. Since it is inside-out-tracking there are blindspots. (Mostly behind you) Sticking your controller on the headset or really close around the headset will end up in loss in tracking. When you do lose tracking though it wont move until it finds the controller again.I do find the tracking is more solid than cv1 and wont lose tracking as easy as cv1 did. I can move my hands faster in front of me and they wont fly all over the place. Batteries are tighter inside the controller so they wont move as easy. (Which prevents disconnecting when playing high speed games such as beat saber)Ring is on top instead of bottom. I find this to be a different feeling but just something to get used to.IPD adjustment is 58-72mm. It is software based and not mechanically moving the lens left and right.Setup is super easy and It takes around 5 minutes in total. Plug it in. Then it does some installation and its done! Controllers are already linked to the headset! You will use a laser pointer to map out your play area using the passthrough lens (its like 2mp I swear) And your done!The halo design is sooo comfortable compared to the cv1! Its softer on the head too! Apparently it is also detachable (I haven't been able to yet) because on the Oculus store in the accessories panel you can buy the halo part. (Cool huh?)Audio;Its a disappointment. The audio has no bass to it like cv1 did and theres no headphones from Oculus to fix this. Sticking headphones over the headset was difficult but after I was able to do it, it was just fine I use Void Pros. Around $100 for those.Audio is like having two small phones playing music above your ears.Cables.Cable is 5Meters long and its thicker than cv1. Its display port and USB 3.0. Which means your graphics card needs a display-port or you need an adapter from hdmi to display-port. I do believe this is an improvement!Hopefully this Review helps!

BLUF: Weak Firmware is causing too many issues to count. Only reason so many positive reviews are here is because of Reddit gettingn its feelings hurt.Issues: DisplayPort cable is unrecognized by my NVIDIA 1060. It is the ONLY device (of 6) in the house with this problem. My original Rift has no issues with a 3 sensor setup running on the same single PCIE slot.Customer support is operating on a significant delay (12 to 14 hours) due to all the problems. That is unacceptable from a multibillion dollar company.Edit: Oculus support Offered to replace it in 8 to 12 days... No thanks. Returned and Reordered... hope it works.

I am a huge fan of Oculus Rift. Been following them since their Kickstarter. I owned the original Oculus Rift for about 2 years and decided to switch to the S to free up space on my desk.My complaints:The nose piece: I cannot stress enough how uncomfortable the rubber nose piece is. I don’t know what they were thinking with changing the nose design, because in its default place, there leaves a giant immersion breaking gap of light pouring in. When trying to adjust it, it pops right out and is a struggle to insert back in, due to weird insert shapes on both the device and the rubber (square shaped versus square with notch shape). When I was finally able to get the nose piece back in, I shifted it up (which means that it’s semi loose because there’s a tab in the center as well). It blocked out the light at the cost of making uncomfortable contact with my tear ducts. It’s also worth mentioning that the nose piece generates an uncomfortable amount of heat, to the point where I was sweating just from there in a casual game like vr chat. It’ll be a germ paradise in no time!The controllers: For anyone switching from the early Oculus Rift CV1 bundle like myself, you’ll notice an immediate downgrade in quality. The oculus rift S controllers that you HAVE to use for this device feel much more plastic-y and rough. Also, the inverted ring, which no one ever explained why they flipped it in the first place, shifts the weight balance a bit and is also a bit of a hazard in fast paced shooters. Now you have to worry about hitting the rings with your opposite controller. It happens a lot too. And because it’s a cheaper build quality, I can see these breaking a lot more frequently than I would’ve with my CV1 versions.The halo design: be ready to mess with the round nob on the back every time you take off your headset and put it on again. The weird design doesn’t give much way to slide back on. You’re always going to have to readjust for comfort, you’ll never have your Rift in a perfect sweet spot setting for longer than one session. The old oculus was Velcro strapped on all sides, so as long as you weren’t trying to show off to a guest, you had no need to adjust after finding that sweet spot. Those days are no more.Passthrough: I thought this would be a revolutionary breakthrough for VR, but my actual experience with it is disappointing as well. There’s a choppiness between all the video feeds that are trying to display a single frame. This is most evident around the borders of the lenses. The best way I can describe this disorienting experience is that things in motion, like your arms, are going to visually scatter in a dozen kaleidoscope like pieces. The slower you move and the more stationary things are around you, the more it generally looks like your room. In general, it’s hard to navigate my room. Oh and I wouldn’t have a problem with the black and white, but the way that it captures even low light is weird. The black and white has ridiculous brightness levels, so much so, that no, you cannot mess with your desktop when Steam bugs out (like it always has). A turned on monitor is a giant white light rectangle. Because of the design of this headset, you can’t lift it up like the original, you’ll have to completely take it off and you already know my qualms about that!IPD adjustment: This isn’t the normal complaint that’s been circulating around the Internet. I’ve got an average pair of eyes. My problem is that the darn software doesn’t work! The lenses remained stationary no matter what IPD number I adjusted into the settings. My entire experience on the Rift S was like peering into a porthole. Oh and you’re not going to see everything in a game. For VR Chat, I couldn’t see the microphone icon, I would have to push down on my headset just to see the icon. The software is bugged and I’m not keeping this headset long enough to wait for that fix.The only benefits: Simple and much quicker set up because of less cables. Sort of sharper resolution (I couldn’t really tell on account of rubber piercing my eyeballs).Final verdict: I’m probably never going to buy another Oculus product. I’m really upset at the lack of quality control that was put into this headset and the controllers. I fiercely defended them on all the social games and the forums, but I can’t stand by this product. For a first time VR user, it can very much give a bad presentation of what VR can do. For an experienced VR user, know that this is the very bottom line of VR gaming. Everything that comes out will be an upgrade... sadly, even the original CV1 from 3 years ago. If it’s not clear from everything I described, the comfort issues completely hinder my experience in the actual games. Most of these problems cannot be fixed with the product. I remain hopeful that Oculus will go back to the drawing board with the design. Either way, I’m not getting fooled one more time by this company.

It was waiting patiently for a VR headset worth owning and Rift S was the first one that checked all the boxes for me:- Easy setup without base stations.- Higher res than first generation VR.- Reduced screen-door effect.- Reasonable price.I've played it only for a couple of hours and I can report it delivers exactly as promised. Tracking is great, comfort is good, everything just works. I was even surprised that it works well for me with my 71.5 IPD. I was able to fit my wide glasses in it too and the image quality was great. Using glasses reduces the field of view a bit, that's why I'm ordering prescription lenses for it.Overall it's a great product - if you are in the same place as myself waiting for the perfect time to get into the VR stuff, the time is now and this is your perfect first VR headset.

I went to install it and was told that it bizarrely requires Windows 10, making it unusable for anyone with Windows 7. I have no idea what Oculus was thinking but this makes it useless. If I can find a way to actually use it I'll update.

The Rift S now requires you to use a Facebook account.  If you have a legacy Oculus account, you have until 2023 to link it to a Facebook account.Facebook does not allow you to create a fake profile, so you will need to use a Facebook account with your real name.  I do not want my Oculus headset linked to my real identity in any way aside from payment information.  The risk of a Facebook ""mistake"" (Cambridge Analytica style) where my private VR gaming information is accessible to the public is simply too great.  Facebook claims you can continue to keep your gaming identity separate after linking your Oculus account to a Facebook account, but history says we should not take their word at face value.

Not a total upgrade, more of a scaled down simple version with a slightly better display?...- I couldn't get adjusted to the device as the manual adjustment options that the original had were missing from this version. So I suffered from issues due to IPD and the ""visual sweet spot"".  Unfortunately for those two reasons everything had a slight blur.  Youre forced with basically several options.  Tightening the headset and/or wearing it higher or lower which is not very comfortable at all. Everyone said it wouldn't be a big deal so I believed them and tried it... Not for me.- The SDE (Screen door effect).  It is still there but definitely not as noticeable as the previous version. Its OK, not great but noticeable. This results in slightly better clarity as well. But nothing to really be impressed with. If it was bothersome to you in the original then it'll bug you in this headset as well.Im picky about graphics. I built a nice gaming rig for those reasons so I was expecting to be really impressed but for $429 w/tax included I couldnt justify keeping it.  This isnt a complete upgrade, its a replacement for the discontinued original product.So if youre picky like me I would suggest waiting for more info on the Valve Index or just sticking to Track IR.

To preface this, I built a new computer specifically with VR in mind.When the headset arrived, the initial setup was simple and went off without a hitch. It worked for approximately 30 minutes and then would lose connectivity (cameras on headset would stop working which prevented any tracking from working). After spending several hours troubleshooting it, I opened a ticket on the same day the item was received.I then spent the next several days trying to troubleshoot the issues with members of the Oculus community while still waiting to hear back on my ticket. I tried every suggested fix with no luck. By the third day, a Friday, I had not heard back from Customer Support so I complained on Twitter and my issue was responded to immediately.I was given a generic list of steps to troubleshoot the device, and after confirming I had done them, was asked for my shipping information and then told that they would ""get back to me"".It's now been a week since I've purchased this item and still no solution, replacement, compensation has been offered. I am sending it back.It's unfortunate that the customer service and quality control from Oculus is so poor as I had really had my heart set on finally owning a VR headset.

I LOVE, love, love my new VR system! I fell in love with the idea of VR with Google Cardboard and recently went to a local VR bar where they had the Oculus system. That sealed the deal for me. I was set on buying it after leaving, only to find out it required external tracking sensors, which I guess I didn't notice was setup in the play space at the bar :( But, I was all set on making it work somehow in my apartment  and was in the process of researching the best setup. Then I stumbled on the Rift S, and decided to hold out for it to avoid the hassle. Boy, am I glad I did!Being a VR newbie, my standards might be lower than others, but my mind was BLOWN straight out of the box! It was a breeze to setup, and I've been playing nearly non-stop since. Beat Saber is by far my favorite game so far.Cons so far:It gets really hot and sweat management is a problem in the headset. I rigged up a makeshift sweatband using sweater tights, and that's helping, but I do worry how it'll affect the headset in the long term. I make sure to take breaks and air it out every hour or so, but it would be nice to have some sort of ventilation system built in.The controllers are kind of wonky and I'm still getting used to them. This is probably a consequence of being new to the Oculus system...Pros: EVERYTHING ELSE. So much fun, I wake up sore everyday and I'm not mad at that AT ALL!I made sure to do my due diligence and research my system compatibility beforehand, and I had to upgrade a few things in my PC build, which I did before the system arrived. Everything worked as expected out of the box. Here are my system specs:AMD Ryzen 5 260016GB RAMWindows 10Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660MSI B450m mobo

This product fails to advertise how you need a separate adapter if your gaming laptop does not have a display port since it does not connect via hdmi. As I opened it out of the box like a child ripping open his present on Christmas I was devastated to see I couldn’t even use it out of the box and had to fork over another $20 to get the display working on the headset itself.

I purchased the original Rift a year or two ago, and I enjoyed it a lot but had issues with the tracking cameras as well as the way it sat on my head, making it near impossible to play comfortably for more than an hour. With the Rift S, setup and tracking is much easier, as well as the comfort level. Minus 1 star for a compromise when it comes to audio

This will mostly be a comparison of rift cv1 and rift s.I have the original rift and the original Samsung Odyssey to compare directly. Used Vive, PlayStation VR and other wmr headsets in the past.-Display: OLED vs LCD  The goodThe first thing you will notice is the change from oled to lcd, and the upgraded lenses.The combined effect is impressive. The improved clarity across the whole display is a huge improvement.The rift lenses were always better than all the others in regards to the in focus area ""sweet spot"" and these lenses are even better. A much wider horizontal and noticable increase on the vertical in-focus area.Reduced godrays or lens flares from high contrast scenes.Full 3 subpixels vs pentileThough 3 subpixel oleds do exist, like in the PlayStation VR, oleds with pentile arrangements are far more common and used in most other displays. In pentile each pixel shares a subpixel with a neighbor, creating a zig zag diagonal pattern and effectively only 2 subpixels each.LCD displays are usually full stripe rgb, so the whole pixel is mostly filled in. This usually doesn't matter on a TV or phone display. It is far enough away that the pixels just blend together. In VR, this display is your whole world, so the small details matter.This means, that even though the Samsung Odyssey on paper has a higher resolution than the rift s, the rift s has more actual subpixels. The more ""full"" a pixel is the less black space = less screen door = clearer image. Things like subtle texturing and small text are much clearer on the rift s.Subpixels per displayRift s:  2560x1440  11059200Odyssey:  2880x1600  9216000PSVR:.  1920x1080  6220800Rift:.  2160x1200  5184000If clarity is your main goal then rift s is the way to go from these options.Robo recall, cosmic trip, and alot of other games that are detailed and don't have too many dark areas look much better on rift s.  The badThe switch to lcd has destroyed the immersion for me in dark scenes.The display seems actually pretty good for an lcd, I think just from looking it has to be at least 2000:1 or 3000:1 contrast ratio.Unfortunately, the original rift would be 10000:1 or 20000:1 especially on the dark scenes.It's just no contest.You either choose image clarity and resolution, or contrast and color.I just got finished playing lone echo on both the rift cv1 and rift s. I would choose the original rift 9/10 times for contrast.In the rift, space is really dark, with twinkling stars and rocks. The silouetted space rocks, dark on one side and white hot bright on the other from the distant sun light.You completely lose that sensation on rift s.Black is a washed out mid grey. It doesn't even seem like a dark grey.Thanks to being in a headset, you can see what actual black looks like all around you, making the grey blacks in the headset seem even worse.Sure you see more textures, metal has this wavy texture I never noticed on rift, you can see further away, and see more details.But when you are pulling yourself through a black tunnel, with the only light being you headlamp, blazing out in front of you...Rift s just can't do it. The tunnel is hazy washed out grey, and thanks to your lamp, you can see in part of it.The Unspoken, the dark moody city you fight in is sharper but grey and washed out. Rift for sure on this one.Tried out ""the bellows"" a free steamvr horror experience. It went from dark and spooky on rift. To boring on rift s. In rift a monster jumps out of the black, in rift s, it jumps out of grey soup.Elite dangerous, space is now grey, and everything is Crystal clear, but flat and washed out. Sure you can read easier, but it doesn't have the impact of a bright glowing hologram display on a black backdrop.Beat saber is another game that looks so much better on an oled, with it's dark backdrop and laser light show going on. Small details matter less in this game.So yeah... The trade-off is a tough one. Any game that doesn't have dark scenes will look much better overall. Anything dark though looks terrible.- Tracking: Out vs InFirst of all, rift s inside out tracking is way better than the WMR headsets. The WMR will lose your hands, just from relaxing them at your sides for too long.As for rift vs rift s, it's a tough call.Rift has full coverage, if you put your arm behind your head, you are still good.Rift s feels, tighter and more consistent. But with dead spots. As long as you are moving you should be good, it will patch the dead spots with the accelerometer and gyroscope in the controller.For example, I think beatsaber is a bit more responsive on rift s.On the other hand, lone echo was better on rift cv1. As you pull your way around in the space station you will notice your tracking will drop anytime your arm is behind you. I didn't even realize how often I did that before the rift s. On rift it just felt natural to hold my arm behind me so I could reach out for something. On rift s your body will jump around as it loses tracking if you try to do this.I think on most games the rift s will be fine, as long as you don't hold the controllers too close to the headset or too far behind you. Think holding rifles, bowstrings, and lone echo holding out behind you.- Comfort and convenience:  baseball cap vs pillowclampOn the rift cv1, I can pull on the headset with one hand. Just loop the back over your head, pull forward and then lower the front into place. The headphone return right to where I left them over my ears and I'm in VR.On rift s, you can sort of do the same thing... If the rotating clamp control on the back hasn't randomly tightened itself. Also, you need to bother with headphones Everytime. Also the headphones will probably need to be in ear, because none of my other headphones would fit with the halo.So more of a 3 step process.Rift:  2 seconds inRift s:  10 seconds in with wire fumblingRift cv1 feels lighter, more solid, more secure. When I have it in place it doesn't move around. It definitely has more face pressure, but that never bothered me.Rift s is heavier but doesn't seem that bad because the weight is evenly distributed. The foam all around is very soft and springy. It's like clamping fluffy pillows to your face. You can freely move the screen closer or further away as it hangs on the halo.It still leaves marks on my face, but not as bad as the rift.- Audio:  the Good and the AwfulnessRift cv1: built in headphones are solid. Good solid bass, mid-range and highs are balanced and slightly warm. semi open. Isolate just a bit without blocking out everything. 3d hrtf works great, and you can tell where things are just by listening.Rift s: horrible distorted mess that sounds like it is in a funnel aimed at your ears because it is.It has a distinct echoey hollow sound and comes from slightly above and in front of your ears.As such the 3d hrtf processing doesn't work as well as a speaker directly on/in your ear. There is no bass below 100hz, and even that distorts at higher volumes. It is very upper mid-range focused and highs are inconsistent.In short, I don't use these for anything. They might as well not be there.Voices sound bad, and music sounds bad. 3d audio only halfway works, so it is just bad.The one bright spot of rift s having a headphone jack is also ruined by the fact that ALMOST NO HEADPHONES WILL ACTUALLY FIT!Thankfully I had a decent set of in ear headphones that seem roughly equivalent to the original rift in quality, but naturally they are not as comfy and have a dangling cable.- Early adopter troublesRandomly you will get a full screen flash of static. Nobody knows why, and supposedly a fix is on the way. Every now and then I lose the correct height or the guardian setup.Conclusion:When I got this rift s, I thought maybe the contrast and the issues wouldn't be so bad, and I could sell the rift and Odyssey. Sadly this is not the case.I will need to keep an oled headset around for darker and contrasty games. (Probably rift cv1)Thankfully you can leave old rift and rift s plugged in at the same time and in the devices menu in Oculus home you can freely switch between them.I think this will be my solution for now.This review may seem mostly negative, but I think the screen is enough of an improvement in most games that I want to keep it.Any darker games and I will need to switch to the rift. The rift s grey blacks just are not enjoyable. So long as there is not too much dark on screen then it is fine.TLDR:Rift SGood:-Sharper clearer screen and improved lenses. Text is much more legible.-display quality is decent, good color and good enough contrast* on brighter scenes.-A bit more comfortable than rift.-tracking good enoughBad:-Lower contrast and black level is grey compared to OLED, dark scenes look terrible.-Tracking has dead spots behind and close to the headset-Built in audio is complete trash, and the band gets in the way of most headphones.-Weird random flash of full screen white static.-Sometimes loses the height or position of guardian setup

Great upgrade from our HTC Vive/Oculus Rift Barely any screen door effect and super easy to set up. So far I havent found any issues and super happy with our purchase. Our old headsets will be put up for sale.Update.After my first hour or so I have been plagued with random black screens, random flashes of snowy screen and once a full snowy screen with 3 dots like a loading screen. I have followed all suggestions listed on oculus site and have yet to find a solution. The top of the halo strap digs into my forehead and is really uncomfortable during extended use. Hopefully these issues are solved with a firmware or  software update soon otherwise we will return and wait for a new revision. We have owned the Dk1 from launch and Cv1 from launch with minimal issues so this is disappointing.Will provide a score update if issues resolved in a timely manner.2 Weeks later.Boxed Up and sent back second Rift S with no plans to get a replacement anytime soon. We tested this on 2 high end machines with similar issues. Worked ok on the beta software for about 1 week with only occasional flashing snowy screen and then another update came through and major problems began once again. The Oculus software would not connect to the server and would request to be repaired, which is a 7gb download each time. After time spent on the forums going back to older version allowed us to play again but the black screens and rebooting constantly were back. Pretty Bummed to say the least.

(Sorry for bad format, wrote on my phone)The oculus rift s has exceeded my expectations from out of the box, but there are a few problems.Audio-The audio in the rift s is just mediocre, it's not amazing, but is good enough. One thing I like about the audio is how I can clearly hear everything while not having any type or headphones or earphones touching my ear. The only thing that is not so good about the ""headphones"" is that they are very loud, so if you are playing in a room with multiple people, they will definitely know what you are doing.Screen(video)-The screen is definitly better, but in some ways. The screen on the rift s makes it much easier to read things, so every thing you do in vr will be much more simple and quick, since you wouldn't have to lean in to read something. The coloring is... okay, once I stepped into vr i definitely noticed that the colors were not as ""realistic"" as the original rift(I know I shouldn't be comparing the two as oculus said it wasnt an upgrade), and still as it was not as good as the rift, it is still not enough to get me to feel fully immersed.Tracking-I was very skeptical about this before I bought the rift s. Tracking had always been a problem for me with vr, but, the rift s almost got rid of all of it, the only time I ever encountered a tracking problem was when I aimed my bow in oculus home, where it froze when my hand was next to my headset. And although the videos I watched got me scared about tracking issues when a controller blocked the view of another controller, it rarely never happened, and when it did, it didnt make a huge difference because it only freezes for about half a second.Comfort- The rift s is surprisingly uncomfortable, at least for me, the mask is constantly slipping down and makes my face sweat a lot(I know, it's an oculus). The nose piece also covers the entire nose, making it very uncomfortable when it gets itchy, causing a delay in playing and a break in immersion while the headset has to be partially taken off.Overall, the rift s is definitely worth it and I'll be keeping this treasure(maybe because they dont sell the original rift anymore) for as long as my gaming days.Update: headset completely broken, took a day break from using the headset and the thing is completely useless, the headset screen is just static, I've tried to fix it, I contacted support, redownload the oculus software, and tried everything on the internet, just no luck. Not buying an oculus product again but I still enjoyed the experience so I'm only taking a star away.

I do own a CV1 Rift; and I still like it; although the main problem for me was the sensors. Few years ago, there was no escape, either if you pick a vive or a rift; but now there is an option.Granted, this is not a revolution from the previous rift; in some ways it has ""lower"" specs; but don't get that fool you. Technology is going forward, as such; you get better products with more optimizations, that are actually going ""slower"". Look at your 16 cores i9 and compare it to a single core CPU from years ago: it goes slower but can do hundreds of things faster, if the code is optimized.So don't get fooled by the number-lovers that tell you that more is better. Refresh rate is at 80Hz; this may be OK for you or not, can't say since most of the people can't tell the difference, but some are more sensitive to the variations in refresh rate, and those are usually more prone to get motion sickness. Give it a try first; but chances are that you won't be able to tell the difference between the 90Hz of the original rift, 80Hz of the S and the 100+Hz in the new Valve Index.The screen is new, it is just one screen, but the resolution is higher. To me it looks much better than the 2 separate screens of the rift; and everything looks crisp and defined, with the new lenses (both the screen and lenses are the same as the oculus Go)The big thing is inside-out tracking: forget about setting up lighthouses or sensors; you can plug in the device and off you go. 99% of the time I felt no problems with the games I play; both for room scale or sitting experiences. Some issues are manifesting if you occlude the controllers or the cameras, so if you put your controller behind you or below a table; but that is the same if you would use a sensor setup.  As far as performances, not that much difference between the rift and the new S model. It just looks better and feel more precise. If you move around a lot, and don't want to re-calibrate the sensors every time, that alone is worth the upgrade. I am in this category.Bear in mind, you still have the cable, but can't do that without. The rift S is a tethered device; you can get a quest for the same price; but you get a watered down experience with the quest, but wireless. The quest is fundamentally a phone chip inside the headset, so while powerful, you have to strap a battery pack on yourself, because you get only few hours of battery life out of the quest; and the graphics is nowhere near the games you can play on the Rift S; because they are mobile games. Some look great, but that is because they were ported to the Quest; with the intention to show the max capabilities of the device. If you have a large PC game library, forget about the Quest, unless you want to stream on it (but you can do the same with the Go at that point, since you won't use the 6 DOF that the Quest support).So in the end, if you have no Rift, the S is a great upgrade. If you have a rift, it may not be a step forward, but more of an improvement. Imagine yourself buying every year the new Samsung or iPhone device; this is exactly the same thing. New device, iterative design, similar price.So pick and choose if the pros and cons are in your range of what you consider important, and decide if you want this device or not.

As of July 2019 Oculus released patch 1.39 this patch addresses the tracking issues that made FPS games unplayable. Fantastic job Oculus! Other issues such as freezing and blank outs have been taken care of too! I can now give this unit a 5 star rating. No need to spend 1k on other VR systems with a headset and Eco system this good! Best VR headset available. I cant go back to the original Vive or Rift, to much SDE. Don't waste your money on the Vive Pro either, The S has a better screen, better controllers and better quality than that unit too. The Index? Tough call, Valve may be better in several ways, but the glare in it is a deal breaker for me. I cant believe a company can charge 1k and have such a ""glaring"" issue. Rift S is the best over all VR headset for me

I had bought this in 2019, and with a proper GPU it works great. Unfortunately the Rift S and all Oculus products will now require a Facebook account to access and use your 400 piece of hardware. To be clear, this device requires drivers that facebook owns and they will not let you use it without an account with them, especially if you are a new user. What is worse is that the occulus store and anything you buy there will not be useable if you dont switch over to their account or if you get banned from facebook, which has happened even to people who havent done anything wrong.So to conclude, if you will buy or like me have bought an Occulus product, Facebook (whoch owns occulus) can stop you from using both the games you buy on Occulus and the Occulus itself for whatever reason it wants.If you refuse to use facebook, make an account, and install their software onto your pc then your occulus and anything you bought on their store will disappear if like me you bought it before this change, and because they own occulus they can, and will at any point ban you from using what is supposedly ""your vr headset"", making your expensive headset a pretty paperweight.

This is coming from someone who had both the original Rift and the original Vive and returned both due to the technology just not being worth the price.Before the Rift S released I watched many videos from reviewers who got to demo the Rift S. Most of them had good things to say about it including the tracking with the built-in sensors. Some even went out of their way to say that there was absolutely no tracking issues at all and they were highly impressed by the headset. Well.........THEY LIED.Here's what you can expect when the Rift S arrives. You get this ginormous box that looks pretty darn epic, you open it up and it's the headset, 2 controllers, an adapter, and the manual. That is all. The rest is literally just empty space. Who's buying it for the box though right? Just wait.Alright so you downloaded the installer for the Oculus Software, you haven't installed anything yet because maybe you'll need the headset when you go to install it. Alright, so you plug in the Display Port Cable and the USB cable to a USB 3.0 slot and hit ""Install"". Let's hope your internet isn't less than 20mbps because all of a sudden, it doesn't install anything. It then starts a download that is over 7 gigs in size. So when you thought you were going to have an easier installation and just jump right into the games, nope. Let's do some downloading first.OK so now you got it downloaded, great. You run through the process, it seems super easy and everything is running great. Until you close the Oculus software and reopen it, then your headset is total darkness. You close it, reopen it again. Nope, still dark. You do some digging on Google and figure out you can restart the software in Settings under Beta, so you do this. BAM it's on again, great everything's peachy.... Until you close and reopen again and this time, restarting the software in the Beta settings no longer works. You then need to reboot the entire PC.Oh but wait, it gets even better. You start playing games, life seems peachy, then your controllers after about 30mins to an hour decide to get ""glitchy"". Then suddenly they are about 20 feet away from you doing their own thing. You close the Oculus software, reopen. BLACK. Restart the software in settings. BLACK. Time to reboot.OK so you start getting used to this pattern and are ready for it, you now expect it so it's not so bad. You decide you want to play some Steam games so you install SteamVR. Your problems are intensified. You do a little research online, oh you need to get the beta version of SteamVR. You get that, things seem to smooth out a little bit, but in controller heavy games your tracking is just off the wall. So you uninstall SteamVR and discover you can launch those games with your Oculus software. Oh look! It's working better now......ish.Alright so now you are getting used to how weird things are with it so you begin to play let's say, Beat Saber. Starts out, you miss a few notes here and there and think oh, I'm just new to the game... Maybe I legit missed it or it was higher than I thought, blah blah blah... As you progress you try more simple songs only to discover, about 20% of your slicing is missed due to the controllers doing their own thing. Next thing you know, you are now up to the more difficult levels and find yourself turning on No Fail mode because you can't get past any song without the controllers going crazy. Then you have to reboot the game, reboot the Oculus software, reboot the PC... This happens over and over again.OK, time to do some research. ""Clean your camera sensors, that should help clear up the tracking issues"" as it says on a random few websites on Google. You do that, nope. Still doing it. ""Make sure there are no mirrors around"" as another website says, so you move that one mirror that it probably doesn't see, but just in case right? Nope. Still does it. ""If your walls are all the same, try putting markers on it, big X's or things so it can track properly"".. Nope, still has absolute terrible tracking with the controllers.Bottom line is this. If you have a sit down game that doesn't use the controllers, this is an amazing headset. If you want to use the headset with controllers like with Beat Saber, RoboRecall, and other games you will find yourself wanting to toss the headset at a brick wall.Is it worth $400? NOT IN THE LEAST. I will be returning this headset as it just feels like a $400 piece of junk. Last time I buy anything from Oculus.

Whelp, FB really fired a nail gun in the coffin for the Rift S, now they have plans to discontinue this device in 2021. Probably because they don't give a s**t about PC users. And I'm sure many other things too.Oh but don't worry, it will still function, but by 2023 you will be required to use a FB account in order to use the Rift S! I have never used FB in my life and will never ever create an account with that sick company full of creeps and degenerates. It's a real shame because this and the Quest 2 are very awesome devices, just placed in the wrong hands.Really tho, FB needs to get out of here with the collection of data and selling it off to 3rd parties. They even openly state this in their TOS, but looks like most of their current users don't care. I'm sure most of them don't even know about this, because who the hell reads a whole TOS right? ""Skip... and accept. Done."" That is exactly what most of their user-base did and probably still do.Most PC gamers and those loyal to the original Oculus team and VR in general can see right through this bulls**t. In my opinion, this terrible practice is much much worse than companies pushing micro-transactions. They take your personal information and make a profit on it! That's how they are able to make the Quest 2 so cheap! They'll get more buyers due to it's attractive price tag and sell their info too! And who knows WHAT kind of info they are taking from you... and by the way, you can't even make a fake FB account as they are constantly searching around and banning accounts that are only used to play VR, so any digital purchases you got with them will be gone forever, and your new Quest 2 (and in the future Rift S) will be useless.Want my advice? Jump off the FB ship. Delete your accounts associated with them. Never give them your money or info ever again. Return this headset purchase immediately or sell it elsewhere. Go look for VR devices other than these ones, trust me, it's better to pay extra than to pay less and have your personal info be in someone else's hands. Don't let FB get near what is supposed to be a personal safe haven for those interested in VR.

Pros-------------------Noticably Clearer Display than Rift-Easier to put on and take off than Rift-10x easier setup than Rift-Passthrough is fantastic-Better Guardian System-Better for users who wear glassesCons------------------Sound Quality is MEDIOCRE at best, extremely tinny and zero bass, very disappointed, Original Rift built in headset blows these out of the water. Even the Oculus Quest has FAR superior audio.-BAD ADS tracking, I tried playing Onward and tracking when aiming down sights was absolutely dreadful and lost tracking nearly every time, any sniper is literally unsuable and is making me wish I hadnt switched from Original Rift-Less comfortable over long periods of time, first time putting it on was very uncomfortable near the nose area, took a little time to get used to.-Feels like the FOV shrunk a bit due to the part that touches your face being a little farther from the lenses, likely to compensate for people with glasses.-Bulky headstrap makes it a bit tough for some headphones to be used.-Cheaper build qualityEDIT: After turning off the USB 3.0 root hub power saving option in device manager I experienced MUCH better tracking overall especially when Aiming Down Sights.

We went from an Oculus Rift directly over to the Oculus Rift S and the difference is night and day. The image is insanely sharper and more detailed. Only having one cord and no extra sensors is a major improvement. The headset fits really well, much more comfortable than before. The controllers take a little getting used to compared to the Rift since there's no flat place to rest your thumbs to make a fist, I guess you have to rest them on the buttons.Overall I love this VR headset. I would highly recommend it to anyone.

it took me awhile to decide between the rift s and the quest. and man am i glad i went with the rift s! so many ""wow!"" moments to be had! if you want to play modded fallout 4 vr, youre only choice (between rift s and the quest) is the rift s! you cant do that on the quest. also with the rift s you are space limited only to whatever storage solution you have in your pc, where with a 64gb quest can be filled up with one trip to the oculus store. basically the quest is a glorified cell phone version of oculus. 2 hour battery life? no thanks! 64gb internal space? no thanks! keep youre weak cell phone quality games to cell phones! i dont know what my ipd is; i didnt bother measuring it. i did adjust the rift s ipd setting to make it comfortable and focused at 66. im a male adult with a big head, for reference, and had no issues with clarity. its also incredibly comfortable strapped to your head and can be worn for hours. if you havent experienced a AAA game in vr, well what are you waiting for!? theres no going back to normal pc gaming! my wifes mad though because the novelty hasnt worn off yet and i keep playing on it! haha!

I have OG CV1 already. This review will compare Rift S with Rift CV1.Rift S Pros:1. Sharp display. Still SDE though, but much less god rays.2. Halo headband. It’s easier to adjust. It's hard to clean after use,  but can be replaced.Rift S Cons:1. Cannot correctly handle sudden movement of headset. The display will “shake” when move head suddenly, and makes Rift S the most “dizzy” VR headset that I have ever tried. I guess Rift S never passed tap test (tap the headset and see whether the displayed image is stable). This is very annoying when dancing in VRChat or moving fast to catch a block in Beat Saber.2. Terrible audio and microphone. The audio have no bass at all, zero. Rift S audio is definitely the worst built-in audio system among all VR device, you will have to buy a headphone to save the audio quality.3. The microphone, maybe not many players use, but if you use Rift S in VRChat, your friends will notice that your voice sounds like a robot or like using cheap voice changer. After recent software update, the voice randomly become loud noise several times per day. This makes social games like VRChat and Rec Room almost not playable until you restart your computer to fix it temporary.4. Static flashes. All Rift S users will face, regardless what computer you use and what game you play. It make your screen like “snowing” for one frame, but happens several times per hour. It keeps reminds you: you are not in a virtual world, you are just watching a screen mounted on your face.5. Controller tracking problem. Usually controller tracking is fine, similar to CV1. But after recent 1.39PTC update, the controller drifting happens several times per day. (This problem used to be fixed by the first sub-version of 1.39PTC, then this improvement was removed by lasted update.)6. Black screen. Sometimes Oculus service just cannot detect the DP port or USB, and the headset has no image. Need a restart to fix.7. Software crashing. This happens two to three times per week, Oculus service itself just randomly crash with no reason.8. Popping sound: there are random popping sound. Just annoying, and no fix.9. New touch controller is a clear down-grade from CV1’s touch controller. The new touch controller not just looks cheap, the sensitivity is significantly worse than OG touch controller, makes it difficult to do a “throw” in games. (BTW, new touch controller is more expensive than OG touch controller.)10. Controller lost tracking around head. This used to be fixed by the first sub-version of 1.39PTC, then the lasted update removed this improvement. I don’t understand why Oculus removes the improvements, remove the fix of old bugs, fix zero bugs and brings a lot of new bugs in latest software update.11. Countless bugs, including static flashes and black screen that mentioned above, there are also other bugs that happens randomly: game cannot add to Oculus library; Oculus service keeps crashing and restarting; Oculus service stop responding when playing SteamVR games, you still able to view the image in headset, but tracking not working; controllers position suddenly fixed at your face, and you have to stop gaming and restart Oculus service to fix it; controllers suddenly jittering like grandpa (need restart Oculus Service, again); passthough+ image become just random static screen when I open a window (why?). Problems happens everyday, I spent many hours to just figure out how to make it work like any other VR device. When I search these problems on Oculus forum and reddit, I found out I am not the only one, not even a special one. These problems happens to many other users also, they say it’s “common”. But I don’t think this should happens in a released device.Conclusion: Oculus Rift S should stay in Oculus lab as a “alpha test” version device. It’s far from a consumer device that can be released. The bugs like “Static Flash” that happens regardless condition should never happen in a consumer device, it should be eliminated during QA test. (Maybe Oculus don’t have QA.)And Oculus’ attitude is also disappointing. They say they know the problems since 50 days ago, and says “will fix with firmware update as soon as possible”. Now they just cannot fix and says they are NOT going to fix it in 1.39 version. Oculus reinvents the word “soon”.Hope Oculus stop selling this buggy toy unless fixing all these bugs and make it a normal quality consumer device. Otherwise Oculus will loss consumer trust.

The Rift S is, categorically, a step backwards from the Rift CV1. The singular improvement - in resolution - is nice, but not nice enough to ignore the many issues that are present. Some - like tracking bugs, graphics glitches, and frequent full-on crashes - should be improved with firmware updates (but you should also launch your product in working order!). Other issues - like fixed IPD and the headache-inducing ""halo"" headband - are just design compromises that were made, and it doesn't really matter whether they're due to necessity or lack of attention to detail.This review is being written only 2 weeks after the launch of Rift S and the much more attention-grabbing Quest. I don't know how committed Oculus will prove to be in fixing the issues with Rift S, but at this moment you should be wary of buying this headset. If you want to dip your toes into VR, the Quest is great so get that, and if you have a high end gaming PC that you're trying to use for the top-tier content, get a Valve Index - or even a Vive, and buy Index Controllers for it separately (slight cost saving). If you really need something around this price point, Windows Mixed Reality is same-or-cheaper price, with smaller tracking area (but arguably more stable tracking), or find the discontinued Rift ""cv1"" and get a 3rd sensor to have 360-degree tracking. The Rift S should have outshined every one of these things as a value proposition, but right *now* is barely a functional headset for a large number of people.You can find lots of issues with Rift S by checking other reviews here, or fan pages on facebook or reddit, but the ones I'm personally seeing are:- Inside out ""insight"" tracking: when working at its best, its still hit-or-miss if you put your hands outside the cameras' view (to wind-up a throw or beat saber swing, for example), or too close to your face (like, to inspect something you're holding). It also often switches from ""at its best"" to ""spinning-world nightmare"" as the cameras sometimes fail completely - the rate of this seems to increase as the room gets too dark or too bright. Sometimes, the entire Insight system seems to crash, locking me into 3-DOF head and hands until I unplug the whole headset and ""reboot"" it (you see the oculus logo and wait a while for it to start up).-Guardian System: this is a box you draw to outline your playing area, and you'll see it rendered in games when your head or hands get too close. It's actually pretty satisfying to set up, but gives you a false sense of security, because from the moment you draw it, it may start to drift. It seems to drift most when taking the headset off and back on, including one time where, right after drawing it and passing it to a friend, the whole box had rotated about 30 degrees and they were running into walls. Since its a protective feature, this drift - usually just a few inches each time - slowly makes the headset less safe to play. For my favorite game, VR Party Club, where you pass the headset a lot, it means redrawing that Guardian boundary every few minutes.-Other software bugs: Everyone I know who has used Rift S has seen what they call ""snow"" or ""bugs"", but I call it ""missing no."" after the classic pokemon glitch. Sometimes when turning my head, I see a few blocky chunks of random-colored pixels in the sides of the view. First time I noticed it, I had just eaten a poison mushroom in Vacation Simulator, so I was pretty sad when I later learned that wasn't a feature of the game, but instead a boring software glitch. Finally, sometimes the headset will just give up all together and ""die"", showing no picture and sometimes playing sounds, until the headset is unplugged and plugged back in. The unplug-replug solution works for a lot of these issues, but causes your running VR game to crash, so it would be *much* more tolerable if Oculus could do a soft-reset without disconnecting.- Ergonomics - Headset: This will vary from person to person, but my feeling is that I have to sacrifice either comfort or clarity to use Rift S. I usually choose to give up on comfort, and crank the headband very tight, to get what is admittedly a fantastic view. But after an hour or two the pressure on my head becomes too much. I wish either the padding in the headband was softer, or there were more adjustments for the tilt of the headset, but I'll give them credit for what's there - when the stars align and everything works well, it's comfortable enough, and feels sturdy and balanced on your head.- Ergonomics - Controllers: It's hard for me to switch from Rift gen-1 Touch controllers to these new ones. The layout is mostly the same, but inverting the tracking ring for Insight feels weird. I'll probably get used to it, but just in terms of whacking tables, chairs, and my other hand, having the ring float above your hand, instead of in front of it, doesn't feel great. It also feels less balanced, partly from the ring and partly due to the plastic feeling a little thinner, lighter, cheaper. There is a more ""premium"" feeling to the old touch controllers. However, whether you're using the old controllers, the new ones, or even the Oculus Go controller, they all seem DEAD SET on putting your Oculus Menu button somewhere you will accidentally press it with the base of your thumb. Maybe its their grand plan - kick you out of your content to sell you new content? I hoped they would have fixed it on the new Touch controllers, but to no avail. I never have problems like that on my Vive controllers. Likewise with an early version of Index Controllers I got to try, the menu button is tiny, off to the side, and recessed. Also with the Index controller, it's strapped to your hand, so you don't need to grip the controller with thumb pressure. I think if Oculus' Touch controller had added a $0.50 strap to let you open your hand without dropping the controller, it would have felt like a huge leap forward from the touch gen 1. Maybe they will make a ""Touch Pro"" that includes it later?Conclusion: There are lots of issues, so I don't recommend this at all right now. But some can and should be fixed through updates, while others will depend on your physical self and preferences. If your IPD is not in the correct range, or your head doesnt fit the hard headband correctly, you will not enjoy using this. If you can, test one out before buying. Once the software is fixed, this would be rated more like 4-stars, or even 5-stars if they could get the tracking to feel as good as last gen, no matter where you're holding the controllers.

UPDATE: Oculus just release a new patch update that all but solved then tracking issues with the controllers. Before, holding the controls in front of each other, like when holding a gun, would screw up tracking. That is resolved now so I added a star to the review. It still gets knocked down for build qualityI was super hyped for the Valve Index but the 1000 price tag instantly turned me off to not only the Headset but VR in general.  That's just too expensive.  I also decided that I didn't want to mess with the sensors and the trouble I heard they cause.  I was just content with my Playstation VR and Oculus wasn't even on my radar until I heard about the Rift S.  The two things that sold me was the insight tracking system which doesn't require sensors and the amazing exclusive games in the Oculus ecosystem.So here is a really honest review from someone who was very excited for this headset.My first impression was that I was disappointed by build quality.  It's not bad, but not as luxury feeling as the original rift was.  It's not really something that I would knock stars off for but it just kind of feels a little cheap.  The face front foam is comfy but also seams weak and a little low quality, but the side visor is very sturdy and does a phenomenal job of blocking out light and sealing to the side of your headI will say that the headset is very comfortable when you are actually wearing it and it's probably the best headset I've worn so far with glasses.  It offers a nice tight seal on the face with enough room between the glasses and the lens.  However, The headset has an adjustment that lets it slide forward but it is very stiff and barely moves that far forward.  It would have been much nice it didI was hoping to find the audio at least acceptable but sadly it is not.  This is by far the biggest drawback to this whole headset and it sucks.  The OV1 rift had a really nice set of headphones and it's just baffling that they would ditch them here.  On the Rift S, the audio is practically unusable.  It would have been okay if they were much much louder but max volume is still unacceptably low.  At least you can fit a good pair of headphones over them but it seems pretty clear that oculus was just trying to cut cost to keep the headset low and I think it was a big mistake in this area. This is the headsets biggest fail for me.The tracking is phenomenal.  I am sure that it's not as good as when you use sensors but it's much easier to set up and the compromise in tracking is for sure worth it.  I'm coming from a PSVR which has terrible tracking so this is such a joy to use.  By far this is the best new feature of this headset and it's exciting. I can bring my headset to different rooms and it just works.The resolution is also fantastic and another great part of this headset.  It's a great improvement over the OV1 rift for sure. I can not notice any problem with the lower hertz rate and the black levels look fine to meSo in short, I'm a tad disappointed with this headset and wished they'd made it a little nicer for the price but if these are the compromises they needed to make to keep it in this price range than so be it, but if they aren't selling these headsets at cost then I think they could have done much MUCH better here.I would still recommend this for one main reason, THE GAMES.  Oculus hands down has the best exclusive titles because they focus more on bringing more people into the ecosystem and incubating game developers to make great titles.  With any gaming system, the most important thing is the games and this is why you would want to choose Oculus over anyone else.I hope in the next couple years we get a true return to form from Oculus with no compromises because I think they are really pushing it with this headset but it still comes out as a decent product.Update:After using this heavily for the past couple weeks I am considering returning it for now.  My hope is to repurchase in the near future in hopes that there are some manufacturing improvements.  In the end, the headset is okay but I think they just made too many compromises and maybe they should have just made a better headset and charged more for it.I still like the insight tracking and not having to set up external trackers but there are more than a few games that are  just not that fun to play because the tracking is inferior.  The build quality is just too cheap for 400$, ESPECIALLY when you pick up and hold the quest and it is instantly clear that the Quest has far superior build.  I really wish Oculus would partnered with someone who took the build more seriously because it just isn't acceptable where it's at for the price.  The Audio is still unusable garbage and I think it would have been smarter to have either provided good audio or excluded it entirely and put the money into making the build better.All in all, I'm not saying this headset is bad, I just think that Oculus compromised too much and it just seemed like a dumb decision given that the Quest is there for people who don't already have a powerful PC, for the headset that is designed for people who have a PC why couldn't they have just made a better headset and charged a little more?  Makes no sense.So since the value isn't that great right now I am thinking about returning this and waiting a while longer for either the price to drop or for some improvements to be made

Love it and easy as pie to setup. I know of horror stories but luckily I have never had one issue yet. No disconnects, no controller issues, and everything just runs like it should. Comfortable and easy to wear though it does get warm fast if you are moving around a lot in games. I used a piece of velcro to tie the cord to the back of the headstrap near the adjustment knob so it wouldn't bounce all over. Then I take another piece of velcro and use a belt loop to keep it at my side during games and it works perfect for my room movement. Superhot VR, The Golf Club VR and any other games have played flawless(note I am using i7-8700k 16GB ram and 2080ti) so older systems may struggle somewhat.Only downside is a static flash in any game once in a great while..like twice in 2 hours of golfing so not bad for me at all. Batteries for the controllers last a long time and simple to change out the batteries. Sound is ok and passable for most but lacks a lot in action games. I just use some headphones if really needed like in shooters. Overall a great VR system for the price. No tracking issues either so far!

-The Rift S is a new product from Oculus completely replacing the original CV1 which required an external sensor setup to work. However on the Rift S the sensors are in the headset itself. The SDE (Screen Door Effect) is reduced by about 20% from it's already minimal state on the CV1, and the refresh rate is dropped from 90 to 80 to maintain minimum specs, which shouldn't cause any worry because the difference is unnoticeable.-ProsEasy setupNo external sensorsThe new headband feels more balancedThe touch controllers are great as usualThe clarity is improved over CV1, making text easily readable-ConsSome tracking problems in FPS gamesAudio is noticeably bad compared to CV1Touch controller's haptic feedback is lighter compared to CV1-TipsWhen settings forward direction face away from computer to avoid having wire in front of youKEEP OUT OF SUNLIGHT!!

OverviewI had my Oculus Rift S delivered on drop day.  I was very excited to see the new version having played the original Rift for a while and moving on to play the HTC Vive extensively.  I was most excited to see the new controls - I've always like the Rift controllers better than the Vive ones.  I wasn't disappointed at first.Early Impressions and the Pro'sWhen I first started playing on the Rift S, I initially loved it!  Except for a slight learning curve trying to get Skyrim from Steam running smoothly on the Vive, it was an amazing experience!  The controllers were far more natural to use than the Vive controllers - as I had expected.  The graphics were a definite improvement on the previous Rift and Vive, both.Then I started getting competitive in Beat Saber again.  I had always been top 250 in world rankings with Expert and then Expert+ songs, but the Rift S made it so much more addictive.  The experience was amazing!  The sound quality was good, though it lacks bass, and the immersion was top notch.  However, it didn't take me long to find some grievous shortcomings of the new Rift S system.The Con'sFirst, the controllers have a loop that now goes up from your hand instead of down with your grip.  This may not sound like a big change, but when you're playing Beat Saber on Expert+ there are a lot of crossovers that bring those loops very close to coming into contact - and they often did.  On top of that, the loops would often slam into my visor because there's no way of being aware of exactly where those loops are when you're inside the visor.The next problems started to occur after the Imagine Dragons expansion dropped.  This is by far Beat Sabers BEST pack yet - please give us more from artists like Imagine Dragons or just more from ID themselves!  With how amazing the system still looked and the updates to Beat Saber, I couldn't put the game down.I'm now top 25 world ranked on Expert+ on a bunch of songs and top 100 on most of the others.  Unfortunately, a little over a month after having my Rift S, I can safely say my left controller is permanently messed up.  The collisions stopped pretty early in my Beat Saber-ing because I did get a sense of where the loops were after a little bit.  However, now the left saber tends to float around wherever it wants even though it's still rotating the way I'm moving the controller - it seems the accelerometer has gone bad. (Just a physic's teacher's guess)I'm going to keep trying to troubleshoot it, but it's not looking good.  It's been getting worse and is getting close to unplayable.  I'll update in the future.

My Rift S has never ever worked consistently.Shortly after Oculus App starts, the LED inside the headset comes on orange and the image in the headset goes black.

ProsBetter screen than CV1 rift, great guardian feature.ConsTracking is horrible if you don't know how to fix it.It hurts my facemic is terribleFlashes of black or white while playingThird day owning and headset refuses to show anything on the screen.I'm stuck waiting for Oculus support to help me with my issue but I honestly just might return it.Was really looking forward to having it but I'd rather stick with my old one or go with the Vive.Super frustrating.

I have owned the original CV1 for the past few years, primarily used for sim-racing, but I do play some room-scale VR. My biggest gripe with the original CV1 was the resolution and the low-brightness, both of which the Rift S have improvements on, which is why I ordered the new Rift S. In my opinion, the resolution bump on the Rift S is huge and the colors seem brighter which are both huge improvements over the original CV1.I didn't know if I was going to like the new halo headband, but I found it to be incredibly comfortable and easy to adjust. I also really liked how I could wear glasses with the Rift S and didn't have to put my contacts in every time. Overall the new Rift S was relatively (see below) comfortable to wear, even in long sim-racing sessions.I also liked how I didn't need to set up any sensors with the Rift S which made the original set up much easier. The inside-out cameras were also cool, allowing me to see my room without having to take off the headset.While the Rift S improved on the graphics, comfort and setup of the original CV1, Oculus did not improve on the facial interface and failed miserably on the sound implementation. On my original CV1 I ordered a new face shield and cover from VR Cover as the original foam face shield was not very comfortable and would get disgusting over time. The new Rift S has the same style of foam, which over time will become sweaty and disgusting. Oculus really should have designed a similar face shield to VR Cover, allowing for greater comfort and to be removed and cleaned as necessary.The next area that was a huge step-back was audio. The CV1 had decent built in audio that allowed a wearer to swing the headphone out of the way when someone was talking to them. A few times I removed the earphones from my CV1 and used headphones, but I always went back to the Oculus earphones due to the convenience and the ""good-enough"" sound quality. Simply stated, the sound quality on the new Rift S is absolutely terrible. For the casual gamer, maybe the sound quality is sufficient, but I don't know too many casual gamers who are willing to spend $400 on a VR headset. I tried using both headphones and ear buds plugged in to the Rift S, and while they both worked it was incredibly inconvenient, especially with the additional wire that would get connected. I settled on using a pair of blue-tooth earbuds that worked well and wouldn't get tangled with the Oculus cord. Using earbuds was still inconvenient to the built-in headphones of the original CV1.In-spite of these two glaring issues of incredibly inconvenient audio and the foam facial interface I was still willing to keep the Rift S due to the advantages of having increased resolution, brightness and ease of set-up...until it broke. In the 24 hours that I had the Rift S the tracking system failed 3 times. I looked online, including Oculus website for troubleshooting techniques, all of which proved fruitless. Evidently this is a known issue which even Oculus has acknowledged. This was the deal-breaker and I am returning my Rift S and setting my CV1 back up. I plugged in my sensors and my CV1 and everything was working perfectly as it was before.Honestly, the Rift S doesn't feel like the next generation VR headset, honestly I feel like they took a step backwards. If the Rift S had decent built-in audio and had improved on the foam facial interface material I may have attempted to work with Oculus to get my Rift S working correctly, but honestly there wasn't enough of an improvement over the CV1 to overcome all of the negatives with the Rift S. While the CV1 is far from perfect, the visual quality, audio and comfort are all good enough, if Oculus had simply taken the CV1 and improved the resolution I would have been all in.

not ready or defective. not sure because oculus tech support was fail.I'm actually sad I had to send mine back and get a refund. It was almost an awesome product.But oculus tech support did not do the needful. I'm certain the issue was the cable included with the headset. Lots of snow and static on screen that didnt show up in a screen mirror on your real screen.Was ignored and treated very poorly by oculus support. After almost a month of using I frantically boxed it up and sent it back to amazon.I think I might pick up another from best buy and see if it does the same thing or not. I tested 3 high end vr pcs with it btw. But either way. I feel let down by oculus support. And Amazon didnt offer replacement of item. They only offer return or dealing with oculus. So I realized I better return this thing asap!I wish they were being more honest about the issues as I would repurchase once issues are fixed.Biggest let down with this device is trying to play non vr games in a vr theater. It absolutely does not work! The oculus drivers upscale everything into 4k even if the monitor being displayed is only 1920x1080... this results in unbearable stutter in the majority of non vr games. And this is something that an oculus go can handle over wifi with open source software like alvr and moonlight for go so I am shocked to see they dropped the ball so badly by not having a 1080p theater gaming mode.... it's actually unforgivable and I think I would have returned this item due to that fact alone if I wasnt having the USB power and snow static issues....I think they rushed the software and the skimped on costs for a high quality cable...

The Oculus software now requires mandatory integration with your Facebook account to use.Also, the Rift stays powered on even when not in use. With Facebook's abysmal history of violating user privacy, you can be sure that they are abusing the mic and camera use. The only way to turn off the headset is to unplug it from the PC.Go with the superior HP Reverb 2 or Valve Index for your VR headset.

Remember, this is a FaceBook company.  A Social Media company that just happens to own a Tech Company.  And that will never be more evident than when you are talking to Support.Like many others, my DisplayPort is a Thunderbolt 3 which requires an adapter to work with the standard DisplayPort plug on the headset.  That's a common thing, and there's a common adapter for it.  Except Oculus ONLY supports the one adapter that comes in the box, a mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort adapter.  No other adapters are supported.  Not even the very common adapter used to convert a Thunderbolt 3 to mini-DisplayPort adapter.Not to be discouraged, I asked if an eGPU with an appropriate graphics card and port would support the headset and they told me that THEY DIDN'T KNOW!!!  That's right, I have an actual support ticket, from Oculus, that says THEY DON'T KNOW!!!  Unbelievable!  It's, as if, I asked on a public forum on FaceBook.If I could get the headset working, there are a number of problems with it that are now apparent to me, such as no adjustment for IPD and lousy audio.  It's not virtual reality if it doesn't look and sound great.  So while the low price tag will surely excite you, I caution you to remember that you get what you pay for.UPDATE:I gave up and purchased a PC that is compatible with the Oculus Rift S for the sole purpose of running my flight sim.  Because, in my case, it's training, not gaming.  I tried several different VR headsets, and in comparison to Oculus Rift S, they are all over-priced and require additional components to do what Oculus Rift does by itself.In short, it's the best of several headsets that I tried, despite a very narrow list of compatible computers that Oculus doesn't even publish anymore.  I think there's still room for improvement, so compared to itself I'd give it 4-stars.  But in comparison to others on the market, it's the clear winner and 5-stars.  And that's why they tend to be sold out everywhere.  There are other, higher-resolution, options.  But they pale in other areas.

If you read most of the negative reviews. They seem to be from people who couldn’t figure out how to get the headset to work or didn’t actually bother to read the specs. You aren’t really offering a useful review because you didn’t do enough research to know you need a display port on your laptop. This headset doesn’t deserve 1 star because of your ignorance.That said, here is what I like and don’t like about the Rift S.What I like:  Since I travel for work, lugging the old Rift and setting it up was tedious. After hooking up and aligning all the sensors and the laptop, I often didn’t even feel like playing a game anymore. The Rift S is a huge step in the right direction for this alone. No sensors. Just 2 cables. Put on the headset after your PC is booted up,  the Oculus software will start automatically, and then your looking at a 3D correct view of your room. You set your floor height by touching it with your controller and then “paint” a line around your walls and furniture for your boundary.The lcd screen is very clear and the lenses are fantastic. It’s a big improvement over the original rift in visuals. I also like the halo head strap. It’s very comfortable and the foam lining feels super soft. The colors are more vibrant that the original rift. That isn’t saying a ton though because the original rift had bad colors and bad black levels for an Oled display. Apparently Oculus calibrated the panels this way to help with problems like black smear and godrays. Godrays are internal reflections from the Fresnel lenses. The Rift S minimizes these reflections considerably.The controller and headset tracking are fantastic. Leaps and bounds better than Windows MR and on par with a 3 sensor Rift set up. No complaints there. You should know that you need the room lights to be on for tracking with the Rift S though, just like WMR. Although I have seen people use infra red lamps to illuminate the room invisibly to humans that seems to work well. It’s your preference. Personally I have no problem with the room lights being on when I’m in VR.What I don’t like: I wish they had used the Oled panels from the Quest. The Quest oled panels are beautiful. Deep blacks, vibrant colors. Much better than the original rift. The LCD suffers in dark scenes. I’d still take the Rift S LCD over the original Rift oled, but the Quest oled would have been better.What I also don’t like: The audio is garbage. There is no way around this. I like not having attached headphones to deal with putting on the headset, but sadly the built in speakers are bad. Now I’m forced to use earbuds until my Mantis clip on headphones arrive from Amazon. I know I just said I didn’t like dealing with the attached headphones on the original rift, but that just shows how bad the Rift S audio truly is. I hope Oculus offers a deluxe audio strap solution at a later date. However, I’m not holding my breathe. They knew this audio was junk before they released the headset in the first place. Upselling an optional audio solution that is better won’t sit well with most consumers.  It’s like selling a new car with a flawed gas pedal that only goes half throttle and then selling you an optional deluxe gas pedal that goes all the way to the floor. Wait, the auto industry does that sort of thing all the time(Tesla ludicrous mode).  Maybe that’s a bad example.I’ve owned/own the original Rift, Samsung Odyssey, Oculus Go, Oculus Quest, and the Rift S. The Rift S is the best of the PC headsets and the Quest is a game changer that you’d have to pry from cold dead hands. If you are new to PC VR, the Rift S is a great headset. If you are fanatical about VR and have a large bank account, you’d have to buy the Valve Index. However, if you are fanatical, you already know all this and probably aren’t reading this review anyway.

Coming from the original Rift with 3 sensors I can easily say this is a huge improvement.The image quality is much sharper, text is now a breeze to read, images seem brighter and the black levels were perfectly normal for me, none of the deep space games were ""grey"" to me.Tracking, wow. it is such a joy to be able to make any direction the 'front' and not have to worry about sensor placement, it really gives a new sense of freedom even with the tether.  When I originally had 3 sensors I always had to worry about blind spots due to corners and furniture, playing a game where I had to interact with objects or get something off the floor was always a chore, if not sometimes impossible. Now it's a piece of cake, I've noticed absolutely no degradation with the tracking and for me I'd definitely say it's an improvement.I've tested it with the likes of:Lone Echo, Beat Saber, Superhot, Racket Fury, Dreadhalls and Space Pirate Trainer, no issues at all.It also works flawlessly with the steam library, Alien Isolation, Serious Sam series, everything came right up.I think my only complaint is the built in speakers that are basically open air, they just don't provide enough bass, but on the flip side it's nice having  them so I can hear what's going on around me. I'm sure they'll release their own clip on's soon enough, but throwing my earbuds on did justice for Beat Saber and I had to lower the volume to 50% because it was too loud - so I can vouch that the headphone jack is fine.I love the comfort of the new band, it's very adjustable and stays on firmly, and it also seems to be much cooler then the original. I no longer have issues with the lenses getting fogged up and there is little to no light bleed getting in.Gone also are the God rays, those horrible odd beams of light refraction reaching up into the heavens.All in all I'm very happy, while I know this is not 2.0 of VR, it's certainly a step up in convenience, comfort and quality of image, I recommend these very highly.

Its no doubt Facebook owns Oculus as both companies seem clueless.I have double or more the requirements. Yet it failed to read my 3.0 USB's reloaded drivers and still said not compatible. I have 32GB ram and a 8GB graphics card, my processor is way above what is required. Yet Oculus failed to say my PC was good enough. I just sent back a Oculus Quest for over heating, and now this Rift S is junk as well.Do not contact support, they are not helpful and take days to answer if ever. Worst service ever.So rather then waste your time and mine, lets just say this is another Facebook/Oculus failed product.Do yourself a favor and search our article that state exactly what I have. Oculus is not ready for VR no matter what hype you hear online in videos and reviews.I  DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  Funny my old Gear with a Samsung 7 works flawless on 4k videoThis junk would even work enough to try.

After upgrading firmware, unknown usb device port reset failed error occurs, PC unable to detect headset, tried all usb 3.0 ports still failed. Bought a 7 ports usb 3.0 hub(adaptor powered) to try and still unable to detect, suspect usb cable faulty. Definitely gonna return it.Update(19 Jun 2019)Do not buy Oculus products if your country of residence is not covered by their shipping as stated on their website.Oculus support informed me that they are unauthorized to ship or sell to Singapore therefore the warranty will not be honored.Does Amazon U.S. know about this?Good luck to those from the ""unauthorized countries"" who bought the headset, if it become faulty after the 30 days return period, you can trash it.

I loved this when I first set it up.  The demo was great.  After a few days, the oculus interface started saying that the oculus software needed to restart.  Once restarted, once again the message the oculus software needs to restart pops up.  A quick search on the internet reveals this is an ongoing issue that has been happening for quite some time.  Sometimes restarting the computer works, sometimes, removing the cables and restarting the software works.  Sometimes nothing fixes this issue.  Once the issue occurs, (no logic as to when), plan to spend at least 20 minutes, cursing and trying to get the unit to work.  When I sit down to play, I only have 20-30 minutes to play so spending 20 minutes to get the unit up and running ruins any enjoyment with this system.  I used to use the Samsung Gear VR when it first came out, and Oculus kept updating the software to where I could no longer use it after 3 months.  I guess Facebook/Oculus does not care if there product works once purchased.  If this was still in the return period, I would send it back.  I have not used any other companies VR, but I suspect they must work better than this. 2 stars simply because I did enjoy this the first 2 days.Revised to one star, nothing I try allows this unit to work anymore.  I did contact support, got back a multistep process to fix including the loss of purchased software and that did not work either.

I cannot say that the discovery of the Oculus Rift S was an easy thing.First, you need a pretty powerful PC to be able to enjoy it with the best experience.Second, this computer needs to be close to your play area. As you will be blinded to your surroundings, you need a safe place where you are not going to punch your TV or trip over furniture. The cable appears long enough at first glance but found myself short and had to buy a Display port extension with a display port electronic extender. Same thing with the USB. I got 6 feet extension for both and I got them to work. Just be aware that any display port extensions will likely not work on itself.Now, onto the Oculus Rift S description:- It is reasonably comfortable. In this summer heat, I still found myself sweating profusely while wearing it. The cable is a bit of a pain since with VR, one tends to turn a lot on himself, the cable will twist around you. I managed to hook it above my head so it would not be as heavy and the experience improved.- It has sound speakers already included but you can also plug a standard headphone via jack.- The definition is not the best out there but it still looks pretty good. No artifact that comes and messes up with your vision.- Pairing is easy, installation too. The software is easy to use and tells you how to define your guardian area (it is a safe zone to play with artificial walls that appear when you get to close to the edge). You can even have the zone active on the floor while you play. There is a pass-through camera that let you view your surrounding in a grainy black and white display but it is good enough to let you see where you are when needed.- The joysticks are working fair and fairly intuitive too. You have a trigger button, a edge button and two buttons to use with your thumb for normal play and one more shallow button on each to activate meta data (like Oculus software data). I still bought a 18$ kit to attach the joysticks to my main fingers to avoid losing them while playing. It is very helpful and should have been provided with the Oculus Rift S unit. Playing Half LIfe Alyx with it is a pleasant yet not perfect experience. I read that the Valve Index Joysticks are way better but there is a huge price jump for it.- VR games library is not huge but there is enough choice to satisfy everyone.My user experience at first was frustrating because I already use 4 displays so I have to disconnect one everytime I have to use the Oculus Rift S. As mentioned earlier, I also had to buy some more accessories to enjoy it fully: Cable extension, grips for the joystick and also a carry case to avoid having the unit getting the dust. I first tried simply google earth (free) and just this experience was amazing. I felt like superman, able to fly into space and back to earth, going visiting areas I know... Simply great.Next, I tried Half Life Alyx and I am now blown away... Simply amazing.In conclusion:At a price range of 400$, it is the best VR for the price. The experience is pretty amazing.4 stars.

I don’t usually write such long reviews but I felt it was warranted after my experience with the HTC Vive Cosmos and the Oculus Rift S VR Headset.A few months ago I started wanting to get in to playing my flight sim programs in VR. All the videos I saw on YouTube made it look really cool and I loved the idea of a more immersive experience.  I had already gotten the PS4 VR Headset last year and found it to be fun but very limited and seemed more for kids games to me. Being the smart man that I am I waiting until the country was on shutdown to decide I could not wait any longer (being home all the time made me want more home entertainment). I had wanted to try the Oculus Rift S, just from the reviews and all the hype behind it but when O started looking t was sold-out everywhere and it did not look like it would be in stock anytime soon. Being determined to get a PC based VR Headset and being limited on room I needed model that did not require external tracking, limited me to only a few models. I looked in to the HTC Vive Cosmos and even though there were some bad reviews I figured it must be pretty good with the price tag of $699 and higher resolution that the Rift S. I ordered the HTC Vive Cosmos from Best Buy and was very excited when it arrived.My HTC Vive Cosmos Experience.The box itself was impressive and I found the instructions and setup to be fairly easy and was up and running is a short time. I downloaded a few games samples from the HTC Vive Cosmos app store and tried to play a few. This is where my first issues came up.  How do you use this thing? I went through all the instructions and as each game or app would load it give some instructions on what the controllers do. I found the buttons did not do what it said a lot of the time or the game would load as if I were 10 feet tall of 3 feet tall. It was frustrating but I was brand new to this and figured I just needed to learn.  I was ready to try my first VR flight sim experience and started up X-Plane 11 and turned on the VR setting and just like that I was in VR in a flight sim.  Ok now how do I actually get a flight going or control the aircraft? It took me probably 2 hours to figure out all the controls and get to where I could actually get in a plane and fly.  Now remember this was my first time trying a flight sim in VR, but all the videos I had seem made it look amazing, smooth and clear. I could not read any text on the dash, no gages, nothing. You can see it all just not clear enough to read the test. I took off and was impressed by the graphics when looking at a distance, looking at anything close and it was blurry, also jagged edges and low frame rate. I also found the controllers to be a bit on the large side and seemed too bulky and the battery life is not good. The headset itself was not very comfortable and was heavy in my head and face but usable.  and I spend the next few days researching on how to get X-Plane 11 to work best in VR. A few changes to some settings and I gave it a few more tries. I got the graphics better to where I could read large text but that was about it. I did enjoy flying in VR but it was buggy and just not a great experience. I kept this up for a few weeks ad finally just gave up, it was too frustrating and too many glitches. I also did not have much luck on any other games or apps using the HTC Vive Cosmos, but DCS Wolds was better looking than X-Pane 11.  I returned the headset and decided to wait until I could get the Oculus Rift S, although I was not sure if it would be any better.My Oculus Rift S Experience.It took me a couple of weeks to get an Oculus Rift S on preorder with Amazon, I finally got one (on pre-order) on June 3rd and it arrived on June 16th.  I was very excited once it arrived and could not wait to see what it could do and if it would be any better of an experience. Once again the box was impressive but when you open it, it seem like less clutter in the box. Now for setup, it could not be any easier. You download the Oculus software and it basically walks you through step by step on how to set up your Rift S. I had already downloaded the Oculus software so my full insulation from opening the box to playing my first Oculus Rift S tutorial in VR took just over 5 minutes. It was amazingly simple. Ok so now I have it on and the first demo tutorials starts and I was blown away but how great the immersion was. It looked and felt so very much better than the HTC Vive Cosmos. I went through the tutorials and knew just how to use my controllers from the simple tutorials and I was ready to go. I download a few free apps and gave a few a try. I was so impressed by the VR immersion and overall experience. The headset itself is light and more comfortable than the HTC Vive Cosmos and it was easier to focus and overall it seemed brighter and clearer to me. The controllers are much more comfortable, light and fit my hands better, and so far the battery life is much better as well. I was now ready to give my flight sim’s a go. I booted up X-Pane 11 again and started the VR. Now this is where my experience really changed, for the better. Just the interface was smoother and I was easily able to select my options and start a flight all in VR. With the HTC Vive Cosmos I always had trouble using the controllers and trying to select something or flip a switch in the cockpit when flying. I had the hardest time aiming and selecting. With the Oculus Rift S it was so easy, just point and click and it just works. Now my flight starts and the first thing it was terrible, I had my graphics set to the highest possible settings (just to give it a try), I adjusted a could things and restarted my flight. Now I was in my plane, sitting on the tarmac and it was so very different from the HTC Vive Cosmos, the graphics were so much clearer and crisp. It just looked better and felt more realistic. I took off and flew around and was just amazed at how much better it was. I paid $699 for the HTC Vive Cosmos and really did not care much for it and felt like I wasted my money (I did get a full refund), I paid $399 for the Oculus Rift S and feel like I got a great deal. I have only spent a few hours on my Oculus Rift S but I am already very impressed with it and am quite happy with my purchase.I would rate the HTC Vive Cosmos a 5 out of 10 and I would rate the Oculus Rift S a 8 out of 10

The PSVR was my first experience in VR and I loved it. It's a great introduction to VR but having spent about 20 hours in the Rift S it's going to be tough to pick up the PSVR again. The main things for me are how much clearer it looks, the range of motion, and large selection of apps to choose from. It did have a few hiccups though.Pros* Screen quality is fantastic. I have a 64 ipd so it works out perfectly for me. There is a digital adjuster but if you aren't close to that ipd I'm not sure this headset is right for you. Text and large screen viewing still has a little bit of that screen door effect, but it doesn't detract from the experience like it does in PSVR. Despite only being an LCD display the colors and blacks seem just as good as an AMOLED.*Ease of use. Setting it up is super easy. Hook it up, download the drivers and you're off to the virtual races. I love drawing my player boundaries. Being able to see my surroundings without taking off the headset is incredibly convenient.* Comfort. The PSVR felt great on my head but this has a very similar feel with a little extra padding and doesn't feel like it might flop about like the PSVR.* Tracking and controls. It's not perfect and if you try it can occasionally lose track of the controllers, but I moved my arms in every direction I could think of and watched it track them. In games I have not had any issues. It is night and day compared to the PSVR. Also not having to worry about setting up external tracking cameras is the main reason I bought this headset over others like the Index.Cons* Audio. The built in speakers actually do sound really good sometimes, but most of the time they crackle or just generally have bad sound quality. Luckily I have no qualms with using my own headphones and the Oculus team has acknowledged they are bad and stated they would come up with a solution so we will see how that goes.* Black Screen. I have seen a few others state this. I did not encounter this issue at all outside of the intial setup which a google search informed me to check my Windows privacy settings to make sure camera and mic were enabled for apps and that fixed it for me.* No Off Button. For now the only true way I have found to turn off the headset is to unplug the USB. Not a deal breaker but can be annoying. If you leave the USB plugged in, it will go to sleep so I have heard as long you don't touch it for a while, but it would be nice if I could just close the app and have it turn off.*Controller rings. I was playing Hot Dogs Horseshoes and Hand Grenades and noticed that the tracking rings got in the way a little bit of being able to do certain actions that require the hands to be near each other.Overall my experience has been fantastic. For me it has been like rediscovering VR for the first time and is such a huge step up from my PSVR. Do keep in mind it uses displayport not hdmi so we can avoid your avoid your 1 star reviews that indicate an inability to read product descriptions. If you want a not too expensive VR headset that is easy to setup, with great tracking, comfort, and controls then I recommend the RIFT S.

UPDATE!!! DO NOT BUY!!!When it was working it was a dream, as previously stated. BUT... IT DID NOT LAST.I've just spent WEEKS trying to get my FAULTY unit REPLACED. FB/Oculus ""Support"" had me UNINSTALLING/REINSTALLING/TROUBLESHOOTING and uploading LOG FILES, mostly as a time waster. This process is not new to me and I am very experienced with VR technology. I suspect that they knew the units were likely faulty and shipped them anyway. WAIT until they fix the units properly and they go on SALE and DO NOT expect human decency from this company.----------------What more do you people want for $400?! Just get it. It's amazing. Screendoor is practically gone! The tracking is amazing! The updated Motion Controllers are legit. A seriously excellent upgrade!

There is CONSTANTLY new problems that occur with the horde of updates that come for this device.Over the year+ that I've had it I am very confident to say that I have likely spend 60 to 70% of my time with this headset troubleshooting it and only 30 to 40% actually using it.When it actually allows you use to it, it is fantastic. But the non-stop issues are just infuriating.UPDATE 6 months later: I still feel exactly the same. This thing breaks every single time they update the device (the pushed updates are forced as well so you can not skip them).They update firmware or the oculus center and the headset goes from working perfectly the day before to completely broken and unusable without hours of troubleshooting.I highly recommend if you can wait, do so. Wait as long as possible or perhaps even until the next headset they release. It is not worth the many hours of frustrating troubleshooting you will have to do.

DO NOT BUY THIS. I ignored the bad reviews and now I regret it. Stupidly, I waited until outside the return window because I went out of town. I've had an issue from basically Day 1 of it losing tracking for my hand controllers, and I'm not the only one. The support boards are full of people who have the same issue and the only support offered by Oculus is ""unplug it and plug it back in"".I have spent countless hours and purchased multiple items to try and get this junk to work. When it does work, it is the most fun I have had in video games. The rest of the time is HOURS of wasted time re-plugging it and restarting your PC hoping it will mystically work this time.If you REALLY want an Oculus, GET THE QUEST. This thing was already garbage, but it's even worse now that the Quest can tether to your PC when you want the extra processing power. It's the best of both worlds and I haven't heard of the quest having this issue.Save the time and money, DON'T BUY THIS JUNK. I wish I could get my money back.

This is my first VR. I'll say this. The experience is truly unique and delivers so really awesome moments in technological breakthrough. When you see certain things in VR your mind just goes ""DAMN, now that is AMAZING"". The amazingness then turns to disappointment when you think about how MUCH MORE VR can actually do once it's perfected. Think of this generations VR like the Playstation 1st generation. It took a couple more consoles in order for it to really shine. We're almost there.Rift s does a great job of showing you what the world of tomorrow will eventually be like. Once the graphics improve, tracking is perfect and the headset is light as a feather, we'll know we've arrived. I'd say we're 10 years off. Not bad.Rift s is 6/10 for me. Worth buying, worth playing and tinkering with...IF... you have the money to burn. For those on the fence because you are not sure if you want to spend your HARD earned money on such a toy, I'd say FIRST try it out (if possible). Then wait a few weeks. If you still think you want it, go for it.I'm almost positive this headset will go on sale for $300 during the holidays. So if you can wait, it would be worth it!PROS -- Super fun activity- Really awesome seeing the potential of this technology. Not just games but art, music, entertainment, medical, travel, exploring..umm...naughty time....you name it.- A good selection of apps to keep you busy for a long while.- Leading edge techCons- Graphic quality is NOT there yet. Screen door effect, washed out colors, immersive breaking pixelation (depending on the app). Just overall still bad. And I ain't even all that hard to please graphics wise. When you see VR videos on Youtube, the graphics look really good. However this is NOT what you see in the headset. You get about 60% of that quality.- Sound is terrible WITHOUT headphone. If you have headphones, you're good.- Certain apps and games can be buggy. Constantly seeing things clip through walls. Myself, other players, etc etc. It's annoying lol-Games are overpriced. As people mentioned, most games and apps are SHORT experiences with zero replay-ability. Once AAA games are made for VR as a standard, expect VR to REALLY take off. Like I said, we're VERY close to this.I'd say 3 to 4 more generations of tech and VR will have reached maturity and epicness.Right now, it's not there if you're expecting amazing graphics. BUT, still worth it if you have the cash.Good luck.

I've had this product for little over a week and multiple times I try to launch games only to be met with a ""you must update first"" message so I go exit the game, go into vr software, update... then I can get into the game... Then the same process repeats another day soon to follow.Most recent was just a popup message saying I should connect my occulus rift to facebook, and the game I was trying to play on steam (war thunder) in vr would not launch until I went to occulus rift software and pressed the ""ok"" button for that message about connecting to facebook.. and suddenly the headset was ""updated"" and ready to play.Facebook purchased occulus company. So Of course I guess this is the natural way to treat their VR headset... like facebook... with popups... unwanted connectivity etc.. etc.. etc..I'm just trying to play games... You'd need to be that kind of person to have the PC rig to run these VR headsets in games and have them run well.Interrupting me (All of us) for minutes via obnoxious popups to tell me I should connect to facebook is not what I paid 350$ for in a headset. Makes this platform/product seem very cheap.Thumbs down facebook.

I've spent over 2 weeks of my time trying to get the new Oculus Rift S I purchased for myself for my birthday and the whole process of trying to get it to work properly has been a nightmare!I have been troubleshooting on almost every forum, internet archive, and nearly tried every solution known to man to try to resolve this problem in hopes to get it to work.The Oculus would work for 15 seconds and then turn off. Because of this:- I've updated my USB drivers in Device Manager and my Nvidia graphics card. I use an MSI VR-Ready gaming laptop.- I've turned off the automatic USB disconnect settings in Power Management as well as other settings.- I've updated all USB drivers manually in Device Manager, including the Rift Hub drivers.- I switched the Oculus software to BETA testing.- I tried downgrading and upgrading my Nvidia graphics drivers.- I've tried restarting my PC with the device disconnected and reconnected.- I made sure my camera settings were enabled and that my webcam was functioning.- I tried all of the troubleshooting steps provided on the Oculus web page for MSI computers and more.- I disabled Nvidia in-game overlay and Steam.- I made sure I didn't have amd-vulkan64.json in System32.After all of this, I contacted Oculus. Oculus instructed me to contact MSI so that they can update my VBIOS.- MSI sent me the VBIOS update along with an EC and BIOS update. I applied all of these and the issue still persisted. The VBIOS update DID make the screen stay on longer, but only for 5-10 mintues instead of 15 seconds. This issue was more of a ""static noise with black screen"" every 5-20 minutes. After all of this:- I tried uninstalling and updated the Oculus software and tried repairing the software as well.- I updated the current build of Windows 10. I even reinstalled the OS in desperation.- I tried starting the Oculus without any background apps running at all.- I've tried and applied certain registry fixes.- I checked the Oculus display cable and made sure it was connected on both ends and flexed the cable up and down to make sure there wasn't a short in the cable.- I spent 50+ dollars on a powered 3.0 USB hub and a various adapters including USB-C to Display Port adapters to test these things out in case the Oculus wasn't getting enough power.The issue still persisted even after all of this time and effort.I'm fairly positive this has something to do with the mini display port on laptops, but nothing will fix this, not even an adapter. It looks like Oculus made a *bad* move not incorporating HDMI. Apparently other users of Oculus Rift S are experiencing the same bugs.To say that I am sad is to say the least. I was very excised to own my first VR-Headset. My perspective on VR and especially Oculus will never be the same after this NIGHTMARE.Be WARNED!

This product is really quite good. It's comfortable, the tracking works well, and the visual clarity is pretty dang good as well. Peripheral vision is a bit blurry, but I've been told that is par for the course with any VR headset - I have yet to test out a Valve Index or professional grade headset, so I'll just have to take the word for it.Audio on this headset sucks. I didn't have an issue putting my over ear headphones over it, but it's very quiet by itself and lacks any kind of bass whatsoever. This, combined with the lack of physical IPD adjustment (software IPD adjustment does nothing perceivable for me), is costing this headset a star.The other gripe I have with this is the software implementation. This can get better with time, and if it does, I'll add a star back. If a controller starts getting low on batteries, it craps out the entire system and you aren't sure why. This happens a lot. If anything gets disconnected or a cord gets bumped, you have to reboot in order to bring it all back. The implementation with steamVR is janky at best. There are immersion breaking single frames that are just white static, no idea where those come from but other users have reported it as well. Sometimes your headset stops working and you have to reinstall the entire Oculus suite to get it to work. I know the Quest is the one that Facebook is backing and putting all of their work into, but frankly this kind of experience is not excusable for such a huge company and such an investment of a product.That being said...If you have a powerful PC and want to play VR games to their fullest graphic fidelity- this thing is pure magic. I've been so conflicted about this review because when it works, everything works great. Stepping into Skyrim VR was a spiritual experience for me as someone who has spent countless hours playing that game normally. Beat Saber is my favorite exercise program. VRChat makes social experiences that much more personal. When everything aligns, this thing delivers, and as you learn the quirks of the software and to protect your connection to your headset like it's a newborn child, you forget about all the frustrations and just want to have this thing on all the time.I had tried the htc vive and original rift - this is better other than the aforementioned issues. I noticed no issues with tracking, and visual clarity is a lot better. I personally really like the controllers of the Rift S over the vive controllers. This headset won't have the ability to do full body tracking if you like dancing in VRChat or whatever, but honestly this is the closest thing you'll get to a good vr experience on the cheap.Something else I like about this is how portable it is. I can throw it in a backpack with my computer and it'll work wherever I set it up. If you have a laptop with mini DP on it, even better. No base stations, just take it wherever you go. Awesome.While I don't think it has the raw appeal of the Quest, good luck finding anything better at this price point. Hopefully Valve releases a middle of the road headset one day, and I can nab that.

I wish I could give it negative stars.  My teens were so excited when this arrived earlier than originally estimated, but the excitement went away quickly.  It took 3 days to get the software ton install and run due to a variety of errors.  Now that it's installed, the headset will NOT connect.  We did our research, the gaming PC is WELL above the required specs, we have 3 available displayports, yet this craptacular device will not work at all.  Contacted support several days ago, no response.  Suspect a defective unit at this point, but wanted to give support a chance to reply before returning this useless machine.  Even if the set is defective, it's no excuse for the poorly written software.

Ok, so first off this was my first VR headset. I was super excited to enter this arena of gaming. Box was really pretty and presentation of equipment was very nice. Everything looked clean out of the box, I first was told to download the software on the website. After downloading I plugged up the display port cable and the USB cable no worries so far. Then after firmware updates which took some time I though it would be a simple sync of the remotes.Boy this is where it got really fun. I entered the VR world of trying to sync remotes. When the remote would try to sync the headset would then lose connectivity to the computer. Then I would have to reseat the usb cable and the display port and start the process all over again. Once after doing this desync dance for about an hour, I finally got the remotes synced. Phew now we are ready for some VR.Started up the VR, was amazed by the way it looked. Very nice image and cool experience....until 5 minutes in it lost my display port again!!!! Re-seat the cables again back up and running. At this point I am concerned I have a setting that I need to change. TO THE INTERNET!!! I find some articles about making sure the USB ports don't turn off. K Done! Then I find an article about power management settings, k Done!! OK back to the VR experience. I start to do some of the tutorial games that are on the Oculus store. Pretty cool stuff, then my audio cuts in and out on the built in speakers. hmmmm this is odd so I trouble shoot these things. Never really found a solid fix for this, they are pretty poor speakers but hey who cares I will use my headset over it which felt comfortable and had better sound anyway.Back to the VR experience....(starting to lose the optimism)Start play the game with the cute robot showing you floppy disk that you shove into a 3d printer. Looks cool sounds cool. And then I noticed the tracking.....of my hands. The Oculus tends to lose your hands and I mean often. You also get a lag of tracking of head movement.  Now the best way I can describe this is turn your head and look at an object to your left. Now imagine if that image was frozen for a few split seconds as you turn your head back to the screen. Instead of it looking natural it keeps the image with you, while this happens hand tracking goes a little wonky also.Now at this point you are probably thinking man this guy is using some under powered piece of crap to try VR out.  Well it might be some sponsored streamer top of the line gaming rig it does have the ryzen 2700x, 32 Gbs of Ram, 1080ti yadayadyada. So then you might be like this dude didn't update the firmware. Oh boy got you there also, I updated to the newest firmware three times, did clean uninstalls along with those installs (which I am gonna tell is a real blasty blast of a time because you get to go through that really fun controller sync-headset desync game). Then people that might have the Rift S will say he should of done the Beta firmware that would of fixed these issues....wrong I even ""upgraded"" to the beta firmware.All in all very disappointed with this product I think I topped around 6 hours of troubleshooting, 6 computer resets, multiple reinstalls of the software, about 10 mid game oculus visual resets (due to the displayport losing connectivity).P.S. Oculus thanks for sending me dead batteries for my controllers it really set the tone for the product. Hope this helps as the title says ""Don't buy.""P.S.S I am not proofreading this either because I have spent way too much time on this product already.

The Rift S and the Game of Thrones finale are the two biggest first world problems I had this year.So much wasted opportunity. The screen is mediocre (a 10% improvement in clarity after 3 years and a $400 price tag. This is a joke). Audio sucks but you 'll use headphones anyway.The biggest problem though is tracking. Tracking flat out does not work in low-light conditions. Also freaks out if your hands are close to your face, or if one of your hands covers the other for a few seconds.Controllers feel cheap, and have weird weight distribution. The battery cover also seems to come off at random times.Software is janky and causes mini freezes when switching menus (ryzen 2700, RTX 2060, 32gb ram, all ssd's).Maybe if it's price tag was $150 it would be a good device for people new to VR. I can only hope tracking issues are acknowledged and fixed with a software update, otherwise to goodwill it goes.

Recently bought a Valve Index, the controller of which was defective. While having it fixed by Valve I got this as a backup, so this review compares it to a Valve Index (which is more than double the price).Things worse than the Valve Index:- The smaller resolution and refresh rate of the Rift S is definitely noticeable. If you are worried you might be prone to motion sickness, that might be an issue, but I am essentially immune and it doesn't matter too much to me, just slightly less graphic fidelity.- The Rift S has a very noticeable FOV. I have adjusted to it now, but when I first transitioned to it from the Index, it felt like I was looking at the world through binoculars. Those few degrees make a lot of difference. It is not horrible on the Rift S, just not nearly as wide as the Index.- Tracking is probably slightly worse than the Valve Index. I get a lot more weird hiccups with my arm flying away from me or my head turning weird, but that isn't very often, mostly I don't notice it too much.- The controllers are slightly less comfortable since you have to always hold them (the Index knuckle controllers have a wrist strap so they stay in place when you release your grip).- You cannot play the Rift S in the dark, because it uses image recognition to track the headset. Gotta turn on all your lights (not a major thing really).- The Rift S is far less comfortable than the Index. The back part of head strap rests on the exact most uncomfortable part of your head, and it always feels like it is going to come loose or fall off and you have to fidget with it a lot to get it in the right position. If it isn't angled perfectly the screen will be blurry. This is probably the number 1 worst part of the Rift S.- Second worst part of the Rift S: no adjustable pupillary distance. With the Index, you can adjust the distance between the lenses. Not so with the Rift S. The Rift S is stuck at something like 63. I am 61, so it isn't a big issue, for me. If your pupillary distance is very far from 63, or you want something that will be comfortable to a wide variety of guests or family members (particularly women and children who tend to have smaller IPDs) it might be a problem.- I have found it is much easier to place Oculus games (even exclusives) through SteamVR using Revive (a program you can download on the internet) than it is to play Steam games through Oculus. This is an issue with SteamVR, I think, since for a lot of games Steam forces you to use SteamVR to start them, so the Oculus software has to interface with it, so you have both SteamVR and Oculus running at the same time. This is compared to running Oculus games through SteamVR, where the Oculus software is far less intrusive and it tends to work better. It is hard to label this as a ""negative"" of the Rift S, since it is SteamVR's fault, but as it stands if you have games in both the Oculus store and Steam, using the Valve Index to play Oculus games works better than the other way around.- The Rift S controllers require AA batteries, while the Valve Index controllers have internal batteries rechargeable via USB. Batteries last about a week of heavy use.- The speakers and microphone on the Rift S are junk compared to the off ear speakers of the Valve Index. Not only is audio quality less, but it is also a lot quieter. The Valve Index speakers can be turned loud enough to where it is uncomfortable, whereas with the Rift S, every game sounds a little quiet at max volume.Things better than the Valve Index:- The price.- More reliable. The whole reason I bought a Rift S was because my Valve Index controllers were defective and I had to send them in.- Because the Rift S has no base stations, it has a lot less wires and that is another thing you have to worry about failing and potentially replacing.- The finger detection of the Valve Index is great, but sometimes, for games that don't use it that much, and where you need to grip and ungrip things a lot, having the grip button of the Rift S is just more convenient and reliable.- The Oculus software is WAY better than Steam VR. Describing all the ways it is would bloat this review, but the bottom line is it is just smoother, easier to use, and less intrusive. You can change almost all important settings for the Rift S while wearing your Rift S, while in VR, through an interface designed for VR, whereas with the Valve Index you have to either take it off or use the virtual desktop. That should say a lot.- With the Valve Index, I get a lot of issues where Steam doesn't know which audio devices to use for input or output, and I have to change it manually when going in and out of VR. This is never a problem for Oculus, which knows as soon as I put the headset on to change audio input and output to the headset.- Oculus has undeniably better VR exclusives than Steam, and some of the best VR games period are Oculus exclusives (Asgard's Wrath and Lone Echo come to mind). That said, you can play Oculus exclusive games using Revive, but compatibility varies game-to-game (I have found Revive works 95% of the time, however).Overall, I am glad to have the Rift S, and even with a working Valve Index I will still use it for Oculus exclusive games. Is the Valve Index worth the much higher price tag? You do get a lot for that extra money, but if cash is really a concern for you I would say the Rift S does its job perfectly fine, and you won't be disappointed.

Super excited to have this VR headset. Please keep in mind that the Rift S is powered by your PC. You need a display port on your pc for this to work. You also need to make sure your PC is capable of running the Rift S and the games. I have a custom build pc that is VR ready. This will not work with your standard PC or laptop. Please read the specifications before buying and being disappointed. A lot of these bad reviews are from people who simply didn’t read or know what any of the information listed meant. Read and ask questions before buying. Note that Facebook now owns Oculus so you do need a fb account to use it/ . This works perfectly and I am having so much fun with it.My PC specs: RX590, 1HDMI Out and 1 Display Port Out. Note if you have to use an adapter to plug in your headset then it’s probably going to have problems.

The device had a sensor check failure during setup.  Before identifying an actual hardware problem, Oculus support suggested replacing the headset through them, which required shipping them the original headset first.  I agreed, and the process took about 4 weeks (initial ticket review, shipping, and processing).Amazon's return policy is normally 30 days, and you no longer possessed the original headset, meaning you no longer have a chance for a refund via Amazon.  (I had 60 days due to special circumstances, but I wasted the extra 30 days working with Oculus support.)  When the replacement also did not work, I asked Oculus for a refund, which was denied because I had purchased via Amazon.  I suggested sending a Quest (same retail price and not dependent on the PC) - this suggestion was ignored.Oculus support used a low-effort shotgun approach to troubleshoot the issue: update drivers, try different USB ports/controllers/an external powered hub, even reinstall Windows for a 2nd time.  This is despite sending them up to 2.6 MB (compressed) of logs after each attempt.Without providing any evidence, even when I directly asked for it, Oculus kept repeating that the problem was specific to my PC.  But even if this were true, it still wouldn't mean my PC was at fault - my PC met all published requirements and had no problems with other display or USB devices.  Oculus refused to acknowledge that the incompatibility could be due to a hardware or software issue with their device but provided no evidence to the contrary.After 2.5 months, I am ceasing contact with Oculus.  This has been a miserable experience.  I paid for the headset many times over with the wasted time, energy, and stress this process caused, but I hope I can at least recoup some of the original cost by selling the headset.  I feel scammed and betrayed, especially by their refusal to refund or replace with a Quest when trusting them is the reason I could not return the headset to Amazon.  I do not recommend this product or this company in any way.

This product has many deficits, among them being lack of IPD adjustment, totally inadequate audio, and basically a V1.5 VR device .. certainly Not a V2.0 generation.  But .. knowing that going in, the last thing I expected was something as simple as connectivity .. plugging the darn thing in.  At first, got both the DP and USB ""greens"" .. and then the USB went to Red.  ALL W10 and USB drivers are updated, including the Oculus drivers.  Doing the rain dance with a hula-hoop with plugging and un-plugging in different sequences and delay times, was not successful.Whoever wrote the software for this debacle should be summarily keel-hauled at the earliest convenience.  There is absolutely NO Excuse for publishing such an immature glob of crap to support what is basically, a ""legacy"" technology.  This is not ""new"" stuff .. this is times tables in third grade.  And hey .. my first ""homebrew"" was an 8080A, and I've written programs in Perl for Unix servers .. I know how this development process is supposed to work, Before going public.  I suspect that the Oculus may be drawing more current than the USB 3.0 specification provides for (900 mA max.).I ordered a PCIe 4 port USB card today as a last resort .. maybe by-passing the MB USB 3.0 ports will solve the problem, as widely reported on Reddit.  The Oculus is the Only device plugged into a USB 3,0 port.  I bought this for ""Pilot Porn"" .. flying VR in D.C.S., and have been sorely disappointed.  If a product does not work as advertised out of the box, then zero stars would most certainly be appropriate.  Cheers!

This is the second oculus product we have purchased. I should have learned my lesson the first time. The first oculus had to be returned twice due to connection/crashing issues, and display problems. But it was a fun product when it worked. So we bought the oculus rift S. Let me tell you this thing was not ready to be released yet. It worked for about a month (after purchasing a PCI-E usb 3.0 product because the 3.0 ports on my motherboard did not produce enough power to run the rift s which I will add is not mentioned in the minimum requirements). Then it began crashing apps after only a month of use. Then covid happened and I got very busy, as I work in a hospital, and I didn't contact oculus support regarding it until April. What has ensued since then can only be described as a dog chasing its own tail. I have been through the same 10-15 support fix responses over and over. They refuse to bring the product in for replacement and at this point it won't even load a single app, it simply black screens and crashes. I could bore you with further break down and descriptions, but you only get so many characters for these reviews and it simply wouldn't all fit here. Just know that you have been warned. I would recommend that any one who is even considering purchasing a Rift S do a lot of research first, as I am not the only person that has had these same issues. I would recommend looking else where for your VR needs. They might cost more, but in this case you get what you pay for. Lesson learned.Update: After 4 months of back and forth contact with Oculus and no resolution they have decided to ghost me. Something every one should know is that you cannot call Oculus support. So when they finally decide they cannot fix your issue without a replacement they simply stop responding to you. They do not stand behind thier warranty. It's unfortunate because I was a big supporter of Oculus in the beginning, telling everyone I knew what a great product it is. Ever since they were purchased by FB they have gone to horrible business practices. Again I urge people not to buy this product. You might get a good headset, but in the case that you don't, I can assure you that you will not be happy with thier customer service.

Bottom line: possibly the final form of Oculus Rift.I've tried on a few VR systems. It could be through my friends' Rift and Vive, or it could be a demo of a WMD system or three from the Microsoft Store. I am intimately familiar with ups and downs of the systems (which unfortunately often involves me having to recoup from motion sickness and having to lie down for a few hours afterwards). As those are quite common and well-known regardless of the systems you choose, I'll scope this review to something that you should have concerns with this system only, and not for the whole of the VR systems that are out today.Consider this an unholy union of Lenovo and Oculus (and by some extension, Sony). Lenovo has licensed some of the Sony's design (after getting sued) from their last VR set, Mirage Solo. The halo ring rig looks and works quite similar, and it is quite easy to adjust. It is actually a plus if you're wearing glasses; I had no problem wearing my glasses and putting the kit on, while I had quite a bit more problem with the original Rift and Vive. Gone are the lighthouses from the original Rift and Vive, replaced with 5 cameras on the headset. It works quite well... but it also does not play nice with your computer if you have too much things plugged on to your computer on your USB ports, so keep that in mind. In a way, it's an evolution of Windows Mixed Reality kits (with 2 cameras), and to some extent, Vive's. Vive, though, needed lighthouses to function.The kit comes bundled with two motion controllers for each of your hands, and is powered by 1 AA battery each. Build quality seems on par with your regular gaming controller, although it is much lighter to account for the fact that you have to hold it up all the time when in use.The Rift S seems to work with all of the games and VR apps that is compatible with Rift, as promised. It will work with Steam VR (it recognizes the kit as a Rift with 3 sensors). Tracking works great with minimum blind spots, but you'll obviously want your controllers to be within the sights of the cameras of the head unit for it to work.The optics are quite forgiving for a VR unit, and I actually prefer the LCD in the S over the OLED on the Rift. Pixels look more filled in, and everything looks clearer. I do not really miss the lost 10MHz of refresh rate, or at least based on the games I played. You WILL need to keep your eyes centered on the optics, which are not adjustable, in order to get the best picture. Fresnel lens have come the long way and this is probably the best of its kind in the business as of today, but you won't mistake it for any other kinds. You will still see the rainbows if you look at the edge. Lights will separate. But it's no big deal; your eyeglasses do exactly the same, but it's just not as noticeable depending on how strong your prescriptions are. Can't completely cheat the laws of physics.But compared to the old Rift, build quality does feel cheap, or at least the head units are. Halo rattles as you pick it up. Paddings feel cheap. You won't mistake this for a high end stuff, although it does cost more than an Xbox One S.I do not care for the speakers on the head unit, but since it's internal I suppose it's two less hinges to break and two less wires to fray. There ARE headphone jacks if you want to use them. I did note some of the issues that others were having with the sound; hopefully Oculus will come up with a solution soon.This will not be an upgrade for your existing VR kit, or at least the ones that are not at the bottom of the barrel; if you're happy with your Vive or Rift, you should not get this unless lighthouses/sensors bother you a whole lot. Field of View is a lot better than a lot of cheaper (and some expensive) Windows VR kits, so maybe you should consider this if you have them. Short of buying an Oculus Quest--if you want to stay in the Oculus Store ecosystem it does sound like a compelling proposition, all without wires--if you want to harness the power of your computer and like to tinker yet do not care for excessive wires of earlier headsets, you should consider the S.

Kind of a cliche title, but absolutely true. VR has become its own thing now. There's many truly fantastic games out there like Beat Saber, Pistol Whip, Asgard's Wrath, Onward, Pavlov, Thrill of the Fight, Moss, and a ton more that are worth your attention. Those games aren't all either, there's plenty of games that aren't VR only that have been truly enhanced by VR too, like Assetto Corsa, Dirt Rally 1&2, Elite: Dangerous, Zone of the Enders, Subnautica, and of course...more.Setup is genuinely quick and easy after the large software download (~10GB). But the HUGE disclaimer is to CONFIRM that your hardware is compatible. This doesn't use HDMI, it uses displayport. Adapters aren't guaranteed to work and the only official adapter is a displayport to mini displayport for gaming laptops. But even then, certain laptops have compatibility issues. (Mostly MSI)I recommend at least a GTX 1060 6GB (or equivalent) and seventh gen Intel CPUs (or equivalent) for everything game to run well. Personally, I have an RTX 2080 and i7-9700k, which I know is higher end, but 2020 is coming and with that ""next gen"" which tends to affect PC gaming as well. So be prepared.That all aside, I never expected how much I would love VR. At first, too many games seemed gimmicky and like lame shooting galleries, but that time has passed and there's arguably just as many must haves as there are on Xbox. (ASGARD'S WRATH, PISTOL WHIP, AND BEAT SABER)Oh... And make sure you have room. You don't necessarily need 6.5 ft by 6.5 ft. But I recommend a space of your arm length and a half. You don't want to punch a wall. (There's a sensor system called Guardian that'll warn you though)Lastly, I only recommend this for the most responsible of children. 10+ perhaps, with supervision.

1. When you bend the cable, you get video noise.  It seems to be a defect in cable design.  I have used zip ties to secure the cable near the connector, and the noise persists, so it is not the connector.  Something about the composition of the cable is just wrong.2. 12.0 update of the software/firmware just made the headset unusable for some of my games.  Other games seem fine.  So, basically, Oculus does not adequately test their software/firmware.  If you search through that forum you will find that one of the games impacted is Beat Saber.  Look, that is the TOP VR game.  Seriously, this is unacceptable.  To add insult to injury, version 12.0 was inflicted on us just before the Christmas vacations.  Seriously, this is ridiculous!!!!!!!!It makes me wish I can afford a better quality VR headset.  At least FIX YOUR SOFTWARE/FIRMWARE!!!!!!!!!!

I am using it with a Lenovo P330 workstation with i9-9900, 32GB, and RTX4000.  Performance is fine.  When you are not using it, you probably want to unplug the USB connector.  It seems like the controllers are still communicating and draining the batteries.  It's a little front heavy when playing for a long period, but all of the VR headsets are that way.  I am surprised that it's clear, even when I am not wearing my glasses (low level prescription).  The games are not expensive, and there are number of free programs on the Oculus store.  What I really like is that it's compatible with the Vive program (Vipeport).  You need to download that program and SteamVR.  The annual subscription is a great deal, since you get unlimited access to 377 games and apps (this is the number as of today).  Plus, you can buy programs there too.  When my kids use it, they tend to spin around multiple time while playing, and the cord starts to tangle.  The cordless version would be convenient (Oculus Quest), but it's not as powerful and doesn't work with Viveport.  To hang the headset and controllers on the wall, I used Ball Claw for footballs.  Flipped it so the to 2 prong part is on the top side.  It works well, since I wanted the lens to face down and not collect dust.

Never in my life have I experienced such a problem with a product and a company unwilling to take responsibility after MONTHS.The rift S worked for a little while just like the thousands of other one star reviews that you should be reading right now.I’m seriously considering a lawsuit.We received this December 2019 and by March 2020 after one of their updates it started beeping & crashing to the black screen. After 30 minutes or less it would keep happening until it became five minutes or less.It doesn’t work at all now after seven months of back-and-forth troubleshooting with my “ticket” in which they make you do ridiculous things constantly sending log files - they even asked me to try it on another computer and if I had a friend I could borrow another cable from who has a rift-s, are they joking???They won’t even send me a cable to try!I’m telling them I want a refund at this point and it’s falling on deaf ears so I guess a lawsuit will wake them up.It seems like 90% or more maybe even 100% of these are faultyAnd they know it which makes them criminal.

This is my first VR headset, so I can only speak from that perspective and have no comparison to the last Rift or Vive.The good-The display is nice, and as far as I can tell no screen door effect.I like the controllers, apparently some people say they are a downgrade.Fun apps and games, but...(see the bad)Good priceEasy to set up out of the box, took about 4 minutes bot counting software download and install which was apparently done by a potato.Comfort is hit and miss. The halo works fine for me the top strap doesn't bother me, and my IPD is apparently fine. The nose piece however is not good. And some people don't like the adjustment knob in the back, but it doesn't bother me at all.I don't know if motion sickness is a thing with VR, but I haven't experienced it other than on No Limits 2, which is kind of the point of a roller coaster, but keep in mind if you're sensitive to things like that.The Bad-The biggest issue is the software or firmware, I'm on my third install of the Occulus software which apparently is the only way to solve the ""Oculus software need a restart"" problem.The low light tracking is awful to non-existant.The games tend to be short experiences with little replay value and inflated prices. Add to that some older games which are fun experiences such as portal need outside software to run.Passthrough is awful, blurry black and white fever dream.Audio. The built in speakers are sub par. You'll wan't headphones.Bulky back cable, but a suspension system with active display port, and USB extensions will negate that.Despite the issues which should be addressed through updates, I'd say it is worth it if it's your first VR device, if it's not read the other reviews and see if it makes a difference. Some of the negative reviews are not really justified in my view, complaints about display port when it clearly states that is how it connects.I'd give it 3.5 if I could, but I'll round down because the software issues are very annoying, and I'm not thrilled that while I've been writing this that I'm only halfway through the re-install.  So three stars with a be sure you can use it, and expect some jankyness with the software.UPDATE 6-5-19Lowering the rating to 2 stars and will be 1 in the event of return. Finding the software incredibly buggy. And though the microphone is detected, it doesn't work. Just started getting snowy screen and frozen hands last night. Re-installing the software for what I think is the 5th time. Will be returning this  if it doesn't work. I don't recommend getting it at this point as it is a constant hassle, random needs to restart computer, software suddenly hanging and needing re-installs.  Not worth $400.6-7-19Waiting on response from support about the issues. I now have 12 right controllers on the device tab, a dead mic, and am in all likelihood returning this product (unless support has an actual fix for the mic). More software issues tonight after working for yesterday and part of today. Have restarted my computer a few times. I will say this, I highly suspect some of these problems are USB port related, and how motherboards and Windows interact. But not the mic, that's just broken. Once I hear from support, or the window for return gets to close, I'll update again.6-9So, got the mic working with an install of windows. Then the rift couldn't pass sensor check. Got it to pass sensor check, mic doesn't work. Now it's constantly losing tracking, hands freezing in home, in game. I've come to the conclusion most of these issues are usb related, probably ASmedia drivers, and the ability of a motherboard to power it. I've tried a powered USB hub, same issue, at this point I'm done, I'm getting a refund. I don't know, seems like this could have been done better, I've seen people mention HTC using a powered bay station, seems like a good idea.6-12I upgraded my motherboard, and this is clearly a USB 3.0 issue. a 3.1 gen 2 has no issues. Sensor and mic work at the same time. Keeping it a 1 star rating because from what I've seen this is a known problem. You may be able to get it to work on 3.0, but I'd say you're best bet is 3.1. Good luck. I did decide to keep this thing though. It is fun when it works.7-25Bumped to 3 stars, Facebook should thank the developer of Elite Dangerous. With the upgrades it going smoothly, and is a ton of fun.June 2020Lowered to 1 starThe software has been a mess for 3 years, antivirus can stop downloads, and when it doesn't stop the download, it stops the install, when it does that you have to shut it down close the software, and...redownload the entire game.Get a vive, get an index, get anything else. There is little to no advancement in development. Continuous issues with stretches of proper functioning.August 2020So the spring in the controller is not good for games like thrill of the fight, but is any easy fix, get larger springs from the hardware store. Bigger issue is the pads in the halo are falling apart, this is from sweat, and the inability to do more than rinse them. The layer of glue has begun to deteriorate, and the cloth is receding from the pad. I'd take away the last star if I could.September 2020The ir lights on the right are failing. Looking through an ir camera most are barely visible. This thing is a garbage tier product, with non existent support whose solution is to reinstall software.  Cant order a new controller as they are out of stock. FYI this product lasted about 18 months and has had problems every step of the way.

Semi fun, seems to have as many issues as it’s benefits. I seriously cannot stand the CONSTANT mic issues which is a big play in my star review. Also the tracking is so garbage... This is absolutely 100% not worth it at all I wish I Just bought used last Gen HTC Vive over this! Mind you I bought then gen and it was absolutely flawless minus the pixel count but sold it at a premium price when it was young! At this point i can honestly without a doubt recommend the Quest over the S as its wireless and can have it's flaws being wireless. This product is absolutely 100% a cash grap. Literally face book giving you the middle finger! Less resolution, less htz, for the same price as a wireless device!? That you can literally stream the same games if you have a good enough connection! In the end, 99.8% a waste of money and time. Had I the chance now to get a refund I would without a doubt!Update: this thing is 100% garbage. It CONSTANTLY loses the guardian zone. I honestly can't stand it anymore. I'm selling this thing ASAP, or trading it for an HTC Vive. Such a bad product I honestly can't say worse things about it

I feel like I've spent more time fixing issues with this headset than I have actually enjoying it.  I recently upgraded my gpu to handle VR, I by no means have a super computer but as far as nvidia and steam is concerned my computer is more than capable of handling vr, scoring a very good rating on the steam vr test.  Out of the box the setup was simple, within an hour I was ready to go and blown away by the level of immersion.  After the first day the problems started happening.  My rift S would always require me to unplug and plug it back in before the oculus software would recognize the display port was plugged in,  annoying but no deal breaker.  After further usage of the headset I realized there were serious audio issues, sometimes I would have a ""popping"" sound that would cause the audio to cut out literally every 15 seconds or so, completely ruining any immersion.  Then after a while the audio started just flat out cutting out permanently, and required me to restart the computer to get it to work again.  Upon further inspection it seems as though the audio is just freezing, as the input bar under the sound tab shows constant sound, frozen in place.  I've tried everything in the book to fix this issue, bought a powered usb hub, messed with the sound settings, unplugged every peripheral I wasn't using to maximize power to the headset, Tried every usb port on the computer, nothing really properly fixes the issue.  It happens at complete random.  I was just about to return the headset, where I found a mix of settings that seems to fix the issues somewhat.  I have to unplug all peripherals, turn headset off and on, restart oculus software, disable every sound input in my computer other than the oculus, turn off msi afterburner, and disable audio mirroring in the oculus software.  Even then its not guaranteed to work, and sometimes I have to restart my computer for it to magically start working again.  Needless to say this has just about ruined the enjoyment of the headset.  I still get random stuttering, weird audio problems, and some tracking issues where my hands suddenly teleport like 20 ft away from me.  After exhausting every message board on google I've seen there are a TON of people with the audio issues.  It seems to be an issue with oculus software, not on the pc side.  Especially since if I just disable audio from the oculus software and use my pc speakers, everything works perfectly fine.  Releasing software in this kind of state is unacceptable, and I have yet to see a fix that actually fixes the issue for good.  They were promising an update to the oculus software that would fix this issue 2 years ago, obviously they haven't.  The only reason I really kept the thing is because I LOVE VR, it truly feels like something new and fresh in the world of gaming, and I wanted to show my family and friends what its like.  I plan on just getting a proper surround sound system soon to where I can just bypass the stupid audio problems from oculus anyway.  But its a dang shame to spend a good month fighting with the software instead of enjoying something I just dropped 450 dollars on.GTX108024gb DDR3 Corsair vengeancei5 4440 3.1ghz750watt power supplyWindows 10

I've had the oculus rift s for about a year now and I've finally decided to review it. the headset itself feel very sturdy and well made. the foam on the headset is soft and feels great even after hours of playtime. there is an aux port on the side of the headset to attach headphones which is appreciated. the controllers and headset track movement very accurately though is it worth noting then on a low charge the controllers have a tendency to drift a little but a simple shake or two will fix it. the visuals the headset provides are a very nice quality and nice resolution. through the use of steam vr it is possible to link 2 base stations and tracking pucks through the use of third party software making this one of the cheaper options for full body tracking for games such as vrchat and blade and sorcery. the only real problem I've had with this headset lies with the oculus program. very frequently I've had to  fight the application to get it to detect my headset and even more often I have to redraw my play space as oculus seems to easily loose it. also it is worth noting that a Facebook account is required to use the headset though after linking the application to Facebook I've never needed the account again nor have I had to login into Facebook to use the headset. overall the headset is very nicely made and performs well when paired with a adequate pc.

We ordered this for my sons birthday and it gave us a date of 10/27/2020 for delivery which was 3 days after his birthday so we decided to go ahead and get it. Then the date changed not once but twice. It did not get her until 11/9/2020 almost 2 weeks later! Why are we paying for PRIME if we can’t get 2 day deliveries. I have NEVER gotten same day or next day delivery!!!  Other than delivery issues. It seems to be a great device. My son totally loved playing it.

Trade-ins getting less than $150 should tell you a lot.  This is a glitchy, frustrating  and ultimately half-baked piece of trash that is in no way ready for prime time.With a rig composed of a FX-9350, 32GB RAM, a RTX2070 and a powered USB3.1 card I bought the Rift S for one single solitary reason: Half-Life Alyx.  The Rift S is EASILY the most disappointing and infuriating experience I've had with any piece of technology in my 30+ years.Hope you have really fast internet at home, because setup is a 5GB file you have to download.  Maybe include a $2 flash drive with the installer?!?!?Hope you like being forced into the Facebook Oculus marketplace because theres no way to avoid it.  Yes, you have to traverse a 3rd party marketplace to get to Steam, which - lets face it - is where 99% of you buy and play your games.  Did you just play a Steam game, like 2 minutes ago when Oculus crashed for the 200th time today?  Good luck finding that game in the miserable Oculus interface.  Theres a 50/50 chance it's not in your ""recent games"".  You can't find SteamVR either and you'll have to take off your headset and start the game directly from Steam anyway.  You cannot start directly into SteamVR.Hope you like Facebook, because in a year Facebook will be REQUIRED to use your Rift no matter when you bought it.  That's a hard ""nope"" for anyone under 60 years old.Hope you like plugging and unplugging, rebooting, resetting, uninstalling, RE-DOWNLOADING THAT 5GB SETUP FILE, disconnecting all other USB devices, sifting through device manager for the erroring USB device, and waiting 18 hours for a response from Oculus/Facebook support.Hope you like drawing and redrawing a ""play area"" because you're gonna get real good at it.  The Oculus Guardian is the single most maddening part of Oculus... and that's saying a lot.  It rips you out of your game and demands that you reconfigure your ""play area"", EVEN WHEN YOU'RE SITTING DOWN.  It loses its settings constantly, and for no reason.  You'll chase every solution imaginable, no matter how arbitrary: change out your brand new controller batteries, close the blinds, clean your already spotless cameras, turn off ceiling fans, turn up the lights, tack a dark sheet on the wall, move away from windows and anything reflective.Then you'll try a different USB3.1 port,  disassemble a newly unboxed headset to make sure the cord is firmly set, wave your hands in circles while starting up, slowly redraw a play area that includes the PC itself (yes really... and no it has no effect).Play area not found, headset cannot communicate with your device, because of an error you have to restart SteamVR.Hope you don't mind strapping in, adjusting your headset, and getting ready to play... and then your headset display goes black.The fixes suggesting ""USB throughput"" as the culprit behind the Rift's shortcomings are flat-out offensive.  Imagine releasing a product with such incompetent QA and such a shallow understanding of your target demographic that you start inventing requirements a year after a product's release.  Its telling that one of the most popular suggestions is to TRY TO FIND THE OLD FIRMWARE and downgrade your brand new headset.My 2nd Rift has been returned and I will not consider an Oculus product again, ever - primarily for their Facebook association, but also for this disastrous failure of a product that could have been a star in the growing landscape of affordable VR.  The cynical side of me believes Oculus released the Rift S for the express purpose of driving VR consumers toward HTC and the Valve Index so we'd understand why you cannot build a  VR headset for $400 and expect it to work.

What a frustrating purchase this has been.  VR is challenging enough to troubleshoot at times and this headset and the company behind it seem determined to make it worse on its userbase.  Google around for Rift issues and the Oculus support form letter responses.  More often than not, it is the intrepid VR community that comes to the rescue with the fix of the month to circumvent Facebook's self inflicted issues (driven by App and Firmware updates).I've had this device a little over a year and have had hours of fun with it when it works.  That said, I've had 3 show stoppers with this device, and Oculus support only helped with the easiest of the 3 (defective controller).  The other two instances were device killing; no tracking or no display and both times Oculus is anxious to point the finger at you rather than their hardware or software.  Being in career IT myself, I know it can be challenging to work through some tickets with some users, but there comes a point where you've exhausted all the reboots and reinstalls and they still won't extend you proper support.  When it came to my tracking issue, I had to give up on the ticket after a week of essentially rebuilding my PC and Windows, only to have a subsequent app update fix all my issues.  Maddening, but at least I was back.The latter issue, display, is the one that has me writing now.  As luck would have it, I'm a few months out of warranty and support is anxious to cut me and my ticket loose, suggesting hardware and tough luck given it has been a year.  The hardware is in pristine shape and the issue again arose with an update preceding it.  I'm currently in a lurch I don't know that I'll escape.  Issues about with all things Oculus is the point; I hope you like troubleshooting.That said, all of my anecdotal headaches aside, know that this device is being discontinued in 2021 and you may need to lean on that warranty through no fault of your own when parts get to be hard to source, so protect yourself from shoddy hardware, crappy software, and a shortsighted parent company and get that warranty.On the positive side, the S is probably the best (when working) way to get into VR cheap, as it appears to be the last PC centric headset Facebook is interested in making, and while Valve's Index is the clear winner in most categories, it is far too costly for many, making the S much more attractive.  It's a shame there aren't more 3rd parties rising to the top here.Overall, great hardware (as far as I can tell at the moment), terrible software and abysmal support.

Overall this is an excellent, relatively inexpensive PCVR system .  If you have a decent gaming PC with display port and USB three,  it’s easy to set up and get started in PCVR.  I can compare this to the PlayStation VR because that is what I  previously experienced. First some negatives,  The  built-in audio solution could be great but on my headset even at 100% volume it’s not nearly loud enough to enjoy or immerse you into the games.  I’m not sure if this is a hardware  limitation or if this could be fixed in software updates. Oculus seems aware of the issue and there is talk of a fix and I’m keeping my fingers crossed.  I honestly don’t mind giving up some audio fidelity for convenience and you can always connect your own headphones.WARNING: The PSVR Mantis can work with the Rift S but . they just don’t fit right and one of them came apart while trying to put it on. Thankfully it did snap back and did not break but the Mantis headphones. Also, I had to remove the cable management clip us a Velcro tie and use that to move the anchor to higher and further back so it no longer interfered with the headsets. it did work in the end but it was a pit of a pain to get it all worked out. You may want to  wait for Bionik to come out with a Rift S version of the headphones or use ear buds until other options are available.The black levels are also not as good as PSVR due to the use of LCD vs OLED.  Its not ""bad"" but once you get used to OLED VR,  its a bit of a disappointment. For many brightly lit games, you won't even notice the difference but other darker games do lose a bit of contrast and pop! OK onto the good. The visuals and field of view feel more immersive than the PSVR. I just get the feeling I’m inside the world a bit more with the Rift.  The fidelity of the games is also much greater. The motion tracking and head tracking are also much better than the PSVR in fact I think the tracking solution is 99% as good as outside in systems with some issues in some game types but when compared to PSVR  it’s no contest. Also the controllers have an actual joystick which makes controllers and games so much better than PSVR.Finally even the set up is simpler than PSVR you only need to connect two cables to your PC and you’re good to go. The fidelity of the experience and the ability to mod games goes along way to expanding your possibilities in VR. If you are the kind of gamer who enjoys messing around with all the layers of PC gaming, I think you will see this as a clear advantage of the more limited experiences with PSVT or the Quest.I think many Rift owners and PCVR fans were disappointed because this new system wasn’t a  Rift 2.0 .  But they ignore the improvements of the ""S' but do ding it, fairly, on the lack luster built in audio .  The tracking may not be 100% as good as the original Rift but saving you the hassle of running three USB cables and installing and mounting three cameras is worth the trade-off in my opinion . If Oculus can fix the volume issue through software (please!), I think they have a real winner here. Even without the audio fix it’s still a decent PCVR system. I think the price will go down and when that happens this will be a really good choice for users who don't mind a wired solution for better fidelity PCVR.  if you want true convenience and no hassles I would say the Oculus Quest is a really great choice.  Oculus is providing VR in the most inventive ways today. I look forward to the quest 2.0 and the rift 2.0 in the future.

Quality of the Rift S is a mixed bag, I returned the product after about a week of use due to issues with the software on my newly installed Windows 10 installation.  Corner cases put the the software in such a state that I could not load up and use the rift on virtually any game.  Started with batteries going low in the handsets, after replacing the batteries, new hand devices would be detected in the software yet the old devices would remain putting me in an endless loop of please change the batteries in the handset error messages when loading up the software.  Old devices could not be deleted out of the software even after complete uninstall and reinstall of the 8gig software package.  This is just one of the many issues I ran into when using the Rift S which caused me to return it and wait for the Vive Cosmos.  If you can live with the troublesome software experience or wait until they work out their bugs, this might be the VR headset for you.

I'm not entirely sure what everyone is complaining about with the rift s. I have owned a cv1 (original rift) almost since it was released and I liked it a lot except for a few small things that I was able to deal with for the cool experience. The screen door effect was annoying and having a ton of cables and running out of USB ports was a pain as well. 3 cameras where needed to have room scale / 360 support and mounting them properly was not a super fun task. The rift s fixed all of those issues for me, they're is no longer a screen door effect, the pixel density is better as is the resolution. The image quality is significantly better than the cv1 well. The headband and face mask are more comfortable and the headset is overall easier to put on. I wear glasses and tried several after market face masks with the c 1 and none of them ever really made it feel comfortable on my face. The rift s is as comfortable as it gets and fits my glasses without issue. The tracking on the headset is a huge bonus as there are no more cameras and nothing extra to buy for 360 tracking. The one issue I have with the rift s is the tiny little speakers on the headband are terrible. My cellphone has better and louder sound. That being said I am currently using ear buds with the 3.5mm headphones jack on the headset, this is annoying as well since I have cord hanging from my face but to the best of my knowledge oculus is working on something for that. All in all I do believe this is a good upgrade from the C 1 model.

I am upgrading my review of my Oculus Rift S. Why ? well I bought it and worked fine for 3 weeks, then the headset stopped working, the headset, while cheap plastic, did work fine, then stopped. I got the RMA returned it al in original packing, They sent me back only the headset with no controllers. it sat barely usuable without controlelrs it will not function. It took another 2 months before they eventaully sent me controllers back. Poor customer service, , very bad. The product work pretty good,. There are many VR brands, and Oculus is the middle of the road brand, not even close tot he best, but not the worst. I have freinds who bought much better, but much more expensive. PLus some of the other brands have much, much better customer service. I cannot find my review when I change dit to one star and told the story of lousy customer service, so it might have been deleted. I bumper it up to 3 starts. I would like to bump it up more but customer service is bad. If that was better, more stars. But, like I said it is not the best, but for $about $300.00 it is good. But I would not go with this product, as it is dicontinued and apparently parts are hard ot get and very expensive. Not worth the huge hassle to get parts or service.

I received my order for the Oculus Rift S promptly. I downloaded the software as instructed and  plugged in the headset when the software prompted me to do so. The headset was recognized and I hit next to install a firmware update, the firmware was installed and then the software tried to recognize that it was plugged in. The device was never recognized and the software said neither the usb or the display port worked. I went to the support page and followed instructions as indicated, no change. I messed with this for a while with no success.I put in to Amazon to have them send me a replacement Rift S. I got the replacement the same day as they picked up the defective one. I again plugged in the headset and went thru the firmware update. The software still wouldn't recognize that the headset was plugged in. It would intermittently recognize the either the usb or display port would work but not at the same time. I gave up and sent the second unit back requesting a refund.The unit is compact and Amazon was amazingly quick to take care of my porblems so I give it one star for that reason. It seemed like it might be a firmware issue since the unit worked or was recognized long enough to do a firmware update, but I was not going to invest $400 in the hopes that it would eventually get fixed. I will wait and buy later. I should have read and paid attention to the over 15% reviews that indicated problems not just the positive reviews. It is the same with the  other  VR's on the market, lots of positive reviews but also quite a number of bad reviews. I love the idea of playing games in VR and look forward to them making them better in the future. I am so happy I did this thru Amazon, I was able to try it out risk free!

Great rig, low cost, lots of games.  This VR rig IS WIRED so understand that before you commit.  Also based on news chatter, Facebook intends to kill this line, so get one while you can.  Other gear can be three times this price.  Take some time to compare the main competitors side by side with your expectations.  But in this case, for only $400 you can't go wrong.  Be sure to get the rubber protective lens inserts if you or anyone in your family wear glasses so you don't scratch the lens.  Also, get the AMVR Touch Controller Grip Covers so you don't accidentally throw a controller at a zombie in the ""real world"" and smash something breakable.

So I bought the rift S, it arrived just fine. But when I got it it had all sorts of bugs and issues. First of all the software wouldn't install correctly. After a few days with oculus support I finally got it working. The tutorial went fine, but as soon as I got into the hub/lobby area in game, a bunch of other issues arose. First, the trackers stopped working, they would rotate just fine but I could not change their position, which was right in front of my face. Several visual glitches occurred (screen would sometimes spaz out), the hub informed me that I did not meet the RAM requirements even though I had specifically bought a PC that was marketed as VR ready and had the necessary 8 GB, so I had to go buy more RAM. I spent 2 weeks conversing with oculus support before they decided it was a hardware issue and we went with getting a replacement. I sent the broken one back to the warehouse, and then oculus screwed my order up, so it never shipped. I opened a second support ticket, they told me to wait a bit and then check back with them. I waited til the date specified, only to find- out they had closed the ticket. I opened a third ticket, they finally fixed my order. It arrived 3-4 business days later than the 8-12 business days they told me it would arrive. It arrived, and guess what? This one was broken as well. Software installed just fine, but once it told me to finish the setup in game, I put on the headset and it didn't change from the loading screen. I wasted 4 weeks with this faulty headset, after saving up for a whole year first to get a VR ready PC, and then to get the actual headset. Don't buy the rift S. They released it way too soon, and it was not ready for sale. Way too many bugs and terrible support. If they still sold the OG rift, I would have bought that but of course, they force everyone to buy their new, terrible, least user friendly rift S. Just go with an HTC vive instead.

Let me start by saying, I've had every Oculus under the sun. From the various developer versions, to the Rift Consumer.  Days before this review, I actually had the Quest! I was so excited, but in the end, I returned it for the Oculus S. Read on:First off, I found the Quest to be way too uncomfortable..  The all in one tech, means it has more hardware packed into the front than you PC powered headset, making it front heavy. I've read every suggestion and watched every video on how best to make it wearable, but nothing worked. I figured, OK, it's a trade off - I have no cords attached, isn't that alone amazing? Well, turns out, not really.  See, I started going on a ""Quest"" to compare games between my ol' Rift and the new kid on the block;  I tried Rec Room first. The frame rate on the Quest seemed good enough, but wait, why are the signs on the walls a bit blurry, and their edges, jagged? Maybe it was always like that but I never noticed? I walked up closely, and now they were super sharp. So now I'm looking at the play panel and notice, not every adventure is available yet (they will be coming though).  OK, I switch to my Rift, and load my Rec Room from the lovely Oculus Home (something the Quest doesn't have). First thing I noticed, the colors weren't as vibrant as on Quest, and yeah, there's that screen door effect which is more noticable. But hold on! All those same signs, from the same distance are not blurry or jagged? I realized, that's how they compensated on the Quest as it's not as powerful as a high end PC.Now I switch to Robo Recall. On the Quest, it looks really good, but now what's this? Something doesn't feel right. The shooting just feels a bit off.  The frame rate seems to struggle at certain points. I switch back to the Rift version, and now things are how I remembered - super fast and every action you pull off is instantaneous. Next up VR Chat. The Quest version looks good - the frame rate is not a problem. Someone informs me that not every avatar will show up on the Quest due to the hardware limitation.  At this point, I've beginning to have second thoughts. I was planning to sell off my Rift and just stay Quest, but I feel the link cable may not be the answer, at least for me. I don't want any shortcomings, and I want my entire Steam Library to work as well as my Oculus Store games.  My battery is beginning to get low... and so is my enthusiasm.This is what made me decide on switching it out for an Oculus S. My laptop is a powerhouse, and it has a mini displayport, so I was set. Hook up was super simple. The S was instantly recognized, and my Oculus Home loaded up with all my previous purchases. The Screen... killer!  Much sharper than the Rift. but the black level is not as black as the Quest (another beautiful screen), as the Quest uses OLED. I went back to the Rift,  still plugged into my desktop computer. It seemed so washed out and almost blurry compared to the Rift S.As for Rift S sound, it exactly like the Quest...firing out of the headband,  and like zero bass. Good not terrible. The Rift's built in awesome headset will be missed.  Still, I can always plug in my own, even better than old Rift headphones.  Problem solved. As for comfortability.... perfect! Oh my goodness, it actually beats out the original Rift which I always considered the most comfortable (I also had the original Vive which was a head's worst enemy).  The S uses the ""Halo"" system, similar to Playstation VR, but even more comfortable.Yeah, I have one long cord attached to my headset, but I don't mind. If I kept the Quest and went for the link cable, I'll be back to where I started anyway.  No sensors taking up space, and awesome full room+ scale.  So now, I have all my Oculus Store games, along with my Steam VR purchases, without any sacrifices,  limits or coming soons.  I finally can put the original Rift up for sale. I'm super satisfied and quite blown away.A final note: If your PC is now powerful enough, than the Quest is a no-brainer. It's an amazing accomplishment. If it's your first VR,  and not coming from a high end PC experience to compare, you'll love it. If you have a high end gaming PC, then I would totally go for the Rift S,  as you will get the whole nine yards, without compromise.

To be honest, I can't even really comment on the actual use of this headset. The hardware seems sound, especially for the price. However, for reasons that escape me, facebook in their infinite knowledge has decided that you require a facebook account to activate your headset, or even use it for anything. And you can't use an account that isn't you, as facebook will find out and lock your account, effectively making your headset unusable.This is a ridiculously stupid decision, as a facebook account has literally nothing to do with delivering a quality VR experience. This is the one problem that made this product drag for me. The prime reasoning for this is that I do not have a facebook account. I try to make one, but in facebook's limitless wisdom, that was quite an issue. My account is locked before I'm even done creating an account. No reason given. They ask me to confirm a phone number, but no confirm code is sent. Here we come to the first step of the problem. Facebook has no avenue to pursue human support. They have zero line of communication where you can talk to a person that works at facebook to help you with your account. So if you're locked like me and can't get a code sent, I'm dead in the water with a $300 headset that is completely unusable. I then reach out to oculus support, who I assume would be able to help me with my account trouble, seeing as they are owned by facebook and a facebook account is step one required and mandatory to use this headset at all. Seems simple, right? Wrong. First, oculus support tries to tell me they are not equipped to handle account issues and only handle hardware issues. Take that in for a bit. Oculus, and facebook behind them, claimed to not be able to handle account issues on their own product that requires me to make an account through them to use their product. Naturally, I protest, which takes place over a few days going back and forth until finally they agree to find me someone that handles account issues at facebook. I am asked to make new email addresses to make a facebook account, which then gets locked. I'm asked to confirm my phone number over email, which does not work. I make a total of FIVE new emails to make facebook accounts, all of which are locked instantly and oculus support, which is relaying information from a facebook account support team that I never got to talk to directly, has zero idea why I'm getting locked and apparently can't do anything about it. This persists for a week and a half, and the $300 headset I purchased is still entirely unusable. I eventually give up, tell support that they were useless and unhelpful to the extreme and promptly return the hunk of junk I bought from them. I then buy a used vive and I am up and running within minutes with zero hassle. Screw facebook for making this brainless decision to lock their hardware behind this idiotic wall of a facebook account.

I'll try to keep this short.For a built-in tracking system for PC VR gaming, this was a blast to play with. I think for any PC oriented VR system, this is definitely the ""entry"" level of all VR headsets. I previously used an HTC Vive and I loved that one. I cannot say the same about the Rift S.Resolution could be better. Tracking was abysmal for me. Specifically the left controller. Batteries were depleted four times in less than a month. And, the worst part of it all for me, was how difficult it was to get it to work. I don't mean the initial setup. I mean whenever I wanted to jump on and play (at any given time) I could never just ""plug and play"". It would take me anywhere from 5-15minutes just to get it to properly recognized within the Oculus App. I had to go through alot of help guides, FAQs, and troubleshooting, just to figure out a way to get it to work. Eventually it got so bad that I had issues while inside VR. After 3 weeks, it died on me. Nothing I did would get it to start up. Oculus App would say its ""connected"" but the headset never turned on. So I gave up on it.I decided to pre-order the Reverb G2 instead after reading that it was designed in a partnership of HP, Steam, and Microsoft. And for something on the low end, I also pre-ordered the Quest 2. Which I have now received, and while the 90Hz mode on the Quest 2 is locked down right now, the experience on the Quest 2 has already been better than I expected and gives the Rift S a run for the money when using the Oculus Link Mode (for PC VR).

After about a month, Oculus software forced a Firmware update download through the Oculus software.  It got to about 90%, and then Oculus.exe bugged out and the download terminated.  Ever since, my rift has been pretty much broken.  I've emailed support about 6 times and all they do is send me useless troubleshooting guides over and over that I've already read on google and their website and tried, none of which work.  So basically, I have a $400 useless hunk of plastic I can't use, that Oculus will do nothing about, because their software engineers do such a poor job of implementing firmware updates that it will break your rift and leave you totally ripped off.  Enjoy wasting your money on this garbage product from a completely garbage company.

If you had the CV1 Rift...like me....hell I had a dev kit Rift. This is a big winner.My Cons:1. 90hz down to 80hz?? No motion sickness. And you can yield better graphics. The Quest is nice, but damn...there is a big diff between a mobile processor and a dedicated GPU.2. Rear sensor gone as I had a 3 sensor setup.3. LCD down from OLED.4. New Controllers are mehBut are these cons??Honestly, those cons are me being hyper picky. Why? The LCD to OLED was minimal and did not detract.80hz cause zero motion sicknessNo rear sensor is minor and has no real impact on my experience.Controllers still obliterate Vive. But the original touch felt so natural and balanced.——So the screen door effect in all VR is all but gone here,very shape details. Text reading is no problem. Headset much nicer to put on.I opened up 3 usb 3.0 ports. Much easier and faster to set up.Passthrough is a god send and works very well. It’s basically 360 3D Nightvision.  This was a smart move on Oculus. If this is the new launching point to based upgrades on. Oculus understands and just gets it right.Rift CV1 is great!! This is just refined!!

VR is a blast, and the rift S is the best way to go from oculus. It has several major upgrades over the original model; first of which is built in sensors so you don't have extra components to mess with. The see- through tech of the headset is trippy but very helpful when setting things up. The foam padding is good on the headset but it absorbs sweat and can get pretty gross in general and especially if multiple people are taking turns, invest in silicone pad covers you can get for about 12 bucks. I found one on Amazon that was a  silicone face cover and covers for the head pads. Being that the front head pad can get pretty sweaty too it's really worthwhile. Putting the face cover on is easy, getting the head cover on is a pain in the butt and I was worried I was breaking something. But just be careful, it works out and is a very nice upgrade. The back head pad cover is not really helpful though, but might as well cause they're a set. Other then that, Google earth vr is free, and one of the best apps on vr period. Anyone could spend hours doing whatever you can think of, and it's one thing you can do sitting down which is nice.  The library is not huge but there are some truly worthwhile things to spend your time and money on. Plan on $100 in software to get things kicked off. Definitely a good family Christmas gift and one that is absolutely worth the investment. It's nice you can see what's happening in a game on the pc monitor, most games have that feature, but a lot of apps do not.

This is my first foray into VR, didn't bother before because the price for a reasonable system was too high. Since I have a high-end desktop with a high-end graphics card, I decided to give this a try, and I'm glad I did. It does take a little getting used to. I've been using it in 'room' mode, haven't tried seated yet.I haven't had any of the issues others have described, but then again, it's only been used for a few days.There are some negatives. First, it gets HOT under the headset, your face will be sweating. Second, the position of the headset on your head is critical. There's a small alignment zone where everything is sharp, and I don't seem to be able to keep that centered, possibly because I haven't gotten the headband/strap adjustment correct yet, but it slowly sags down just enough to blur things. Finally, there are a lot of software moving parts for Half-Life: Alyx. You have the game, which uses SteamVR, which uses the Oculus VR app, which uses the Oculus drivers and your graphics card's drivers. They all have to be up-to-date and running. But, was it worth it? Absolutely!Update, once I figured out how to adjust the top strap and the headband, no more centering issues. Hours of play in HL: Alyx, it has worked flawlessly.  It does eat batteries in the hand controllers, get s set of rechargeables (I love Panansonic Enerloops). I'm now doing mostly seated, because I got tired of my dogs tripping me. It still gets pretty warm under it, you will sweat, and while the weight is about as good as it gets, it will still tire you out. I'm finding about an hour of play is my limit. But, still, it rocks.

I held out a long time before finally breaking down and getting one. I read all the reviews and for the money the Oculus was the way to go, unless you have $1200 to throw away to get the steam version, which they say is superb. It should be for that price. That said, the Oculus didn't disappoint. I'm not so certain I would buy it for the game play as much as for the emersion experience. Basically it is like being on a holodeck. There are some drawbacks though. When compared to a monitor it's like going back to SD TV. Even though the optics are HD, they are still darker, pixelated, and a little blurry. That doesn't mean the the immersion isn't awesome. Even the demo and setting up your virtual home was cool as hell. Actually being able to walk around and grab things was amazing. It's truly like standing in a holodeck, where the room becomes whatever it's programmed to be, another room, the outdoors, the old west, you name it. Downloaded one of the free programs about flying in a bomber during WW2, and it was quite interesting. It reminding me kind of like being on the Disney submarine ride but more immersive. The set up was pretty easy and mapping a zone around the room was as well. For those that don't know, zone mapping allows you to walk around without bumping into walls, tables and such. I didn't run into anything, but I had to fight the urge to sit on furniture that wasn't there. Only drawback is the headset isn't wireless.  They should make some sort of roof mount the spools out the line. I didn't use it in a big room, but going to try that next. I did have a couple issues getting Steam to play nice with it. You have to download the Steam VR and cancel out of the zone setup, and them I had to upgrade the video drivers but that was Steam not the Oculus. Once I finished that the Oculus freaked out and kept telling me the battery for the controller was low, and the headset wasn't displaying correctly. Going into the settings and removing the controllers, re-adding, then syncing fixed that. Once that was done I relaunched it and Steam and everything worked great. Into No Man's Sky I went. It definitely brought a new reality to that game. My video did get a little jittery when on the ground in the game, bit it was still cool. At this rate in another 10 years we will have real holodeck technology, but for now this is still pretty awesome.

Corrected review (take 2)I've upgraded my 7 years old PC and got a Ryzen 3700x with an Asus TUF 570X mother board (to accompany my GeForce 1080 card). Rift S now works like a charm againCorrected review 5 months in - the Rift S stopped tracking correctly :(I'm getting a sand hour glass, black edges around my play area and a lot of lag in play. unusableOculus support keeps trying but nothing helps. Even got a replacement Rift S. Same issues.I went online and read many other people are experiencing the same or similar tracking issues. Too bad.I really thought the Rift S will be much more mature - but I guess it's not there yet. Not for me anymore.Original review -It took me a while to pull the trigger on the Rift S.There were a couple of reasons for that -1. It seems like many other VR consoles were coming out2. I had the Rift version 1 and returned it as it has horrible tracking issues and I hated the sensors all around my living room. Also, some games didn't workI have to say Facebook did an awesome job with the Rift S to fix the tracking issues and the passthrough feature is so helpful, even though it's very blurry - so you can detect people and objects but you can't read texts on your phone, for instanceWhen it comes to resolution and clarity, it's very similar to the Rift. It might seem lightly better but it's far from perfect.Also, I have an IPD of 59 and was able to set it up via the software. I can't say it made a noticeable difference when I changed it.Bottom line, for 400$ it's a no brainier - GET IT. It's a lot of fun!!!It may not replace your console or PC games yet, but it's a great new alternative immersive way of playing :-)

When I bought this, it was under the reassurance of a promise made by Facebook themselves, that I would never be required to have a Facebook account to use it, Not only was that a lie, but they've also discontinued the Rift s and will no longer going to be supporting PCVR moving forward.I stopped using Facebook years ago and have no plans to go back, their cavalier attitude towards privacy and security are laughable, last year there must have been 20 different occasions of user's private information getting leaked or hacked, and their attitudes after the fact have generally been ""whoopsie"". I know that they've said that people who are ""grandfathered"" are able to use their old Oculus login without linking to Facebook for another 2 years, but am I supposed to now take Facebook at their word, that they won't go back on it in a few months? Since they're discontinuing it we will also be receiving less to no updates for the headset, meaning if and when windows update breaks it, we'll be waiting a long time for a fix from Facebook, if ever.Moreover, because it was discontinued, resale is in the toilet so I can't even offload this thing for half what I paid for it less than a year ago. and it was launched in 2019!If I had known all of this I absolutely would not have bought this headset, I feel like we should be entitled to a full refund from Facebook, if I had the power I would absolutely do something about this. It's not right.

The Rift S is an amazing product. When I put it on for the first time and was moved into the initial demo with the little robot it was with a real sense of wonder. Nothing can compare you for the initial impression - I think that awesome is quite appropriate. You really do believe you are in a different world. The sense of immersion is so deep. I love it, so why am I returning it? Well, one reason is that the cable is very long and is quite heavy. It is very awkward when I use it sitting down by my PC - gets tangled up very easily. Standing in a reasonably cluttered area, which most peoples home offices are, it is all to easy to blunder into stuff as the Guardian system is not 100% effective (as detailed in the guide). If the problem was only the cable I could have found a way to work around it however there is a much bigger problem with the Rift and that is its range of IPD settings. IPD ) Interpupillary Distance, is the distance between your two pupils. I did not know this but people's IPD varies a lot. The other main VR headsets use a mechanical means to adjust the IPD to match your eyes, the Rift S is the only one to use software adjustment. Without the IPD setting being correct, a certain amount of blurring will occur. For me the image was fairly clear in the middle but quickly became blurrier moving away from the center. I tried all sorts of adjustments to fix it but could not. My IPD is 70mm. This is what the Upload site says: ""For Rift S and Go, the lenses are fixed at 63.5mm. This means Quest is “Best for users between 56mm and 74mm” and Rift S and Go are “Best for users between 61.5 and 65.5mm,” according to Facebook."". I can't use the Rift as my IPD is too big - you'll notice that the Quest has a much larger range for IPD and so I will check that out. So, the Rift S is a fantastic product as long as your IPD is within its limit and as long as you can live with a reasonably thick and quite long cable - the videos they show of people using them are Fantasy Island, no-one has rooms as free of clutter as those in the videos, especially teens bedrooms! Be sure you check your IPD before you order the Rift S. If the cable is not a problem for you and your IPD falls withing the optimal range then go get it, you will not be disappointed. Do a search for how to check your IPD. You just need a mirror and a ruler, the online guide will tell you the 'how to'. Oh, I only gave it 3 stars as the IPD problem is a major dealbreaker for many.

Don't get me wrong, it is fun while it lasts, the problem is it doesn't and the customer service is absolutely incompetent.After less than one year after the warranty expired, all of a sudden the headset stopped working. At first, the display port would not work anymore. No video, only sound and whatever goes through the USB connection. I tried every single solution out there and eventually I was able to get the DP to work, but now the headset would stop at the part where it tries some sensor calibration. Nothing could be done anymore, so i called customer support. They asked and got the logs, looked at them and concluded that they had no idea what was wrong but never admitted it. They asked me for the serial number and proof of purchase with the excuse that it was necessary in order to send the unit back. After that, they decided the item is out of warranty and they will not do anything with it or for me. I understand the unit is out of warranty, but what about letting me know to send it in for repairs? I'd be happy to pay to have this fixed. Just a whole lot of nothing. This was the worst customer experience I ever had, just unbelievable. So, the recommendation is, before buying an Oculus product consider if it is worth your disappointment if anything at all happens to it.

I was hesitant to upgrade from Rift to Rift S based on some of the negativity.  However, I consider it a 5-star device and well worth the upgrade.  I’m using a Dell Workstation 7720 (“VR Ready”), which was NOT “VR ready” on the setup of the original Rift despite Dell’s advertisement to VR Ready workstation.  After days of troubleshooting, I had to change a Bios setting to disable the Integrated Graphics interface (and just use the onboard NVIDIA Q4000).  My Dell does not have a DisplayAdapter port; however, the Rift S does come with an adapter.  After some hesitation on this adapter and a year old Dell with a state-of-the-art VR display, I was pleasantly surprised to have the Rift S up/running in about 15 minutes which included a mandatory Firmware update to the VR display and two controllers.Design improvements.1.  The headband is completely redesigned and much more comfortable.  Very easy now to swap between a few people, without fussing with 3 straps.  The form fit to your face is also more comfortable now.2.  Speakers.  May be reduced quality audio but improved reliability.  One speaker snapped off my original Rift (children involved) which was easily fixed.  However, that unreliability is improved in the new integrated speaker design.  I also plug in the laptop to my HDTV/Denon receiver for room sound.  I’m happy to see the design will hopefully hold up better with the younger people using my VR set.3.  Rift S Room setup.  HUGE improvement.  The original Rift needed a reset (for me anyway) anytime a sensor was bumped, moved, unplugged/plugged in, etc.  The floor setup is a huge improvement - you reach down and put the floor grid where you want it.  Guardian setup is done by standing in one location and shooting your area with a controller.  (Genius improvement).My main VR app has been Beat Saber, so the device tracking and accuracy is vital to playability of the game.  Not only is the resolution noticeably improved, the tracking has slight improvements as well.  KDA/Pop Star - Expert level right now...new Rift S let me get a new high score.For the people you gave this device one-star rating because your computer can not handle VR setup.... get a new computer.  It’s not Oculus’ problem.  I’ve been building desktops and playing computer games for 30+ years now.  I never envisioned being able to “step inside” a game.  That said, the demand on my Dell laptop is incredible.  Oculus Rift software is the ONLY app that will cause my laptop cooling fan to run constantly during game play.  However, I’ve also helped friends with high end gaming systems get Oculus Rift working.  There is much information out there on the minimum requirements for your system graphic card...and Oculus is not kidding about “minimum computer specs”.  This is a 5-star gaming system that won’t work with 1-star computers.Star Wars: Vader Immortal.  Quick plug for this Rift game since I’ve been a Star Wars fan since 1977.  I never imagined I could setup inside a Star Wars movie and “play along”.  The light saber training module is important before you enter the main game.  Otherwise, this game is full of awesome motion/graphics (taking your ship to light speed), looking overhead and seeing an Emperial Destroyer flying above you, climbing ladders (not for faint of heart with heights), solving puzzles, and meeting the Dark Lord himself with the booming voice we’re all familiar with.Google Earth.  You can “fly” in VR or drop down to Street View and literally “walk” down any memory lane where you used to live, or visit somewhere you haven’t been.  Look around 360 degrees and take in the wonder of that location.  Any “must have” app for Oculus Rift/Rift S users.Oculus Rift/Rift S takes computer gaming  to a whole new level.  I don’t yet see myself putting on the VR headset to watch an HD Movie as some are doing (resolution is not yet 4K), but the action light saber games, flying a plane (or futuristic hover craft) is a whole new computer experience.If your computer can handle it, go buy it.  If you’re on the fence with Rift to Rift S upgrade...pull the trigger.  The room setup alone is worth the upgrade to me, let alone dropping the need for external sensors.  5-Star device that needs a 5-star graphics card to make it work.

I purchased this from Amazon as a gift for my son, who loves computer games. At first I thought it’d be more of a fad, something like 3D TVs or any other rushed and half-baked technology product, but my kid’s birthday was coming up and he just kept asking for it, so I figured I’d give it a try.After a quick setup+registration process (didn’t like it that a Facebook account was necessary to use this product, but since I barely use my account, I decided it was alright), it was ready for use.The first impression is quite something. I expected the close distance to the eyes and bright display to feel uncomfortable, but at least my kid (and I also, because obviously, I had to try it), didn’t get any discomfort from the stereoscopic displays. However, the head mount (called “halo”, I think) and bulky forehead are something you have to get used to.It seems Oculus has been developing this technology for quite some time, and the results are they created and own most of its market.Image quality is good, but not perfect. Sound is very immersive and refresh rate hasn’t been an issue for me.Being able to run from your computer has its ups and downs. You can use Steam VR and play any compatible game in your library, without having to buy again. You can also buy from the Oculus store, and probably many other pc platforms. I haven’t tried watching Netflix or any other movie either with this headset, but I understand it could be an interesting experience if it had a higher resolution.Now the Quest2 is Oculus’ new bestseller and Rift S is being slowly phased out, so probably some flash sales will extinguish current existences. However the convenience of the newer model’s wireless connectivity or built in processing and storage will probably be a major factor for most users at the time of purchasing. I personally think this unit feels well designed and built. Collaboration with Lenovo is definitely a big plus. However most people will probably choose Quest2 over this aging model.The 5-cameras tracking system is good, and the hands controls are fun to use. However be prepared to buy alkaline batteries in large packages, since most rechargeable batteries can’t power them properly.Physical IPD (inter pupillary distance) adjustment, eye tracking, wireless connectivity, higher resolution, foveated view with central focus ultra high resolution, better sound, more compact and lighter design, more tracking cameras, better software integration, and a long list of other desirable additional features and  improvements would probably take this technology further in the future, but at the present time, it is a good working unit for the uninitiated to get their hands around the VR headset technology. Word of caution, don’t spend too much time wearing this headset without a break. We’re just not ready yet to live in a simulation (unless we were already living within another one).

I'd had a Gear VR previously but this is so much better naturally because it can track your movement and allow you to move through space (the Gear VR can only track your head rotation).VR is still a little pixelated but much less than I was expecting. Skyrim and Fallout 4 look amazing in VR though quality drops off fast at distance due to the resolution limitations.I was having issues with static and intermittent black screens in the headset. As Oculus Support advises, had to pull the cable out of the USB and Displayport which was fine, but I also had to pull the facial interface off which at first doesn't feel like it should come off (it does) and then pull the cable out of the headset which took a long time and a lot of effort and other users have reported the same frustration. Plugged it all back in (USB first then Displayport 5 second later), and it worked better. Also a driver update was pushed out that was supposed to help. Either way, I'm having a lot less interruption of gameplay, no static and only the occasional flash, no more black screens. Its acceptable for me and hopefully there will be further updates to make it work even better.If this is your first VR headset, be aware if you wear glasses for nearsightedness, you're going to need to get prescription lenses for the headset or switch to contact lenses (which is what I did). Having the screen right up against your face does not remove the need for vision correction like you might expect as a nearsighted individual because the screen simulates depth.The other thing to be aware of is that the headset requires a Displayport connection and a separate USB 3.0 or higher. Be sure you know which ports on your computer are USB 3.0 because it will matter (mine had a mix of 2.0 and 3.1 in spite of being only a year or two old and a high end gaming motherboard and they weren't labeled, I had to look at my motherboard manual to be sure which port was which).

This is one of the most frustrating devices I have ever had. I have the HTC Vive, and while it's a pain to setup because of the stations that have to be mounted high up on the wall, at least the headset works all of the time.The Good- The Rift S is easy to read. The ""screen door"" effect is almost completely gone allowing me to read my computer screen in virtual desktop.- Easy to setup - just plug in the display port and USB plug, and it's ready to go.- Controllers are light and they run on disposable batteries.- The headset is light and comfortable- Runs great in SteamVR but it also has the Oculus store to fall back on-Note: I have good peripheral vision, and I can see the edge of the Oculus because of the small FOV, but once I get into a game, I tend to forget all about it.The Bad- The headset get's flashes of white or static about every 3 or 4 minutes.- The controllers occasionally freeze mid game or application. They seem to get stuck and all you can do is point, not more them in an app. When this happens, simply closing out the game or app does not work. The only solution I have found is to reboot the computer.- The down-firing speakers built into the head band have terrible sound. It's like listening to someone else's headphones that are a few feet away.- They released a new version of software that refused to install or work and this forced me to roll my windows version back to a previous version. To me, this again show a lack of proper testing.ConclusionThe Oculus Rift S was obviously released to early. If you wish to purchase one, I suggest letting this device percolate for at least the next six months before making a purchase.

There isn't a real way to describe VR better than ""You have to see it for yourself to believe it.""I could go on about how Amazing VR is and how once you experience a virtual environment you'll realize how hard it will be to believe in 5-8 years people will still be looking at flat screen TVs for entertainment and that includes games. Yes, We are still early adopters meaning the technology is not perfect, the headset are still bulky, there is no good wireless PC powered option and the tech overall still has a way to go but experiencing only the tip of whats possible is still so overwhelming that it completely melts away any current flaws!3D movies look Amazing in VR even compared to a big screen 4K TV. Not since Avatar have I seen a good 3D movie but in VR the same 3D movies on a flat screen look dull look completely different in VR and all the content on the screen is coming out around you. VR made 3D movies look cool again!The Rift S is a great headset! I see a lot of *1Star* reviews with complaints about the lack of support for ""HDMI"" and there are two good reason for that reviews might not be picking up on why that is. First the situation is if your computer doesn't have new enough hardware to have a display port VR your computer probably isn't going run VR well and the device clearly states it requires a display port!With that being noted understand the system requirements for the Rift S are probably lower than they should be because there is already VR content to buy for the Rift S that go beyond what is printed on the Rift S box with some content requiring a GTX1070 or better. Now the 2ND reason for no HDMI support is how VR headsets work your computer is literally powering two separate lenses/ display screens at once and it takes a large amount of bandwidth that current USB 3.0/3.1 and HDMI 2.0B ports don't support. A good example here is the previously PC Free OCulus Quest now has the ""Link"" feature allowing the Quest to powered by a PC with a 3.0 USB port on your PC. There a lot complaints from users and other review sites about users experiencing headaches due to the USB bandwidth lag causing an even lower refresh rate around 74hz and slow response times to fast movements. I don't think that is the type of experience any user would be happy having.The Rift S headset feels comfortable and the controls feel great in my hands with excellent button placements. The installation was quick, easy and a lot fun while going through tutorial mode. I suggest every Rift S headset owner check out the latest games on Steam as the Oculus store doesn't have a fraction of the amount of content that steam does with many titles listed on Steam for free or at a low cost.The only negatives is I wish this device had more upgrades than the original Rift and not just what feels like a good refresh but don't believe rumors the original Rift is no where close to being the better than the new the Rift S in anyway. Bringing that issue up I wouldn't have mind spending a little more money for a true RIFT ""2"" instead of a Rift ""S."" I still believe is this headset is the best overall consumer based VR headset on the market. The only other consumer headset I might be able to call better than the Rift S but can't is the Valve Index but at $999 I can't call it a good value. On top of that the Valve Index software is rather buggy also brings forward last gen tech that gave VR a bad name by using lighthouses causing the need to run cables for tracking instead of inside out tracking built into the headset which the Rift S has making VR setup and use much easier.I did order two of these from two different places because the Rift S has mostly been sold out since December of 2019. The first one that came I'll need to return because one of the controller triggers is making a ""squeak"" sound and sticking sometimes but I won't knock a single star off for what is probably a fluke on what is otherwise an amazing product and experience.5 Star Product - Thumbs Up!

[Updated]Has improved significantly since launch. Setup and software is now a lot more stable, and we are getting to consistently play with it. VR games are great, though you need floor and room space to really go at it.[Old review]Not ready for prime time. At best this is alpha or pre-beta level. While it works for some, it is not plug and play at all. Reddit and support forums are filled with issues. They should be paying us to test their software/device, and need to hire better quality engineers.Wasted 2 days trying to get it setup on my PC (Windows 10, GeForce 1660, Ryzen 2700X, PC specifications far greater than Oculus recommended settings). After initial 7GB software download (which needed to be done several times to attempt to repair the install to try to fix the issues.. waste of bandwidth)Software restart problems. Software never quite detects the rift S sensor via USB 3.0. If that happens on PC restart, then you face DisplayPort issues. 10 restarts and cable resets finally get it to detect the headset and sensors, but now there are ghost (extra) right and left controllers. The ghost controllers drain the battery and prevent the system from working. Manually had to edit the DeviceCache.json to fix the ghost controller problems. Software constantly tries to restartBlackscreen problems. Even if you attempt to start the tutorials on the Oculus, the system gives a blackscreen, and no image on either the headset or PC shows.Device driver problems. Quick look at Device Manager shows yellow exclamation marks on Oculus Rift S, Rift S sensor, PC camera, Rift S updater (list of devices keep changing on reboots).TechSupport is super slow given all the other folks having issues as well.Very sad to have wasted so much time on this. Most wireless devices, bluetooth or USB devices work plug and play, with quality software engineering. This setup is poor given the issues faced.

I was super excited to get my first VR headset, especially at such a good price since most are under $400 at the time of writing this. However, there are some downsides to this headset.Pros:- Setup was very simple- High image quality- Many compatible games- Cheaper than it’s competitors- Very long cable included- Great tech support even with COVIDCons:- When left plugged in and not using, after restarting my PC it will just show the headset as not connected- The wire often gets tangled around you when moving around (I would recommend the Oculus Quest 2 to prevent this)- When updates come out my headset temporarily will completely stop working until I install them- Lower refresh rate than other more expensive headsets- Had to be perfectly on your face to prevent the screen door effect (same will all headsets)Overall, this would make a great gift and is perfect for people on a budget that want to experience VR

Got this item with a damaged cable, contacted manufacturing and they blamed my PC not being ""capible"" I can run the Valve index no problem but Rift S has cable issues upon arrival requiring disassembly just to unplug and plug back in...the microphone sounds like a robot and the sound system sucks so badly kills emersion. $400 worth of junk just get the new quest 2 with the link cable for PC or buy INTO VR seriously and get something worth while. Absolutely embarrassing for a company to blame my hardware when I can run something worth $500 more perfectly fine. Plus finger tracking...step it up Oculus. Stop sending refurbished shit to people's house mine was clearly defective but I don't even like the oculus home at all. Everything is a software/hardware issue to them and you'll either have no problems 90% of the time or be like everyone else and have to return their first purchase due to errors in manufacturing, a lack of CARE for your money. I refuse to reorder. Also tracking and pairing is garbage

While this took a lot longer to set up and get working (almost 90 minutes), once installed it is amazingly good quality VR.  Here's my extensive install sequence:1. Need to install Oculus software.  Must first create account, sends email verification2. Log in to get email verification, authorize account3. Log into Oculus software and start install4. Wait!  You have to update your video drivers first!5. Go to NVidia site, find driver update link.  Must first create account (ugh!) sends email verification6. Log back into email account, authorize7. Wait 2 minutes for video driver download8. Begin video driver install, wait 5 minutes & reboot9. Log back in, restart Oculus install10. Wait 15 minutes for Oculus install (what is it doing for 15 minutes???) & reboot again11. Complete install, asks to perform firmware update.  Approve update.12. Wait 2 minutes for firmware updateFINALLY READY TO USE!This newer version only supports Display Port which, thankfully, my video card has, but the result is a simplified connection of only USB & DP.  The setup sequence to configure the Oculus is simple and thorough.  The Guadrian fence system is brilliant and keep me from banging into furniture.  Worth the money for the experience and all the exercise the kids are getting from Beat Saber.

I have a new laptop that easily meets all the requirements. GTX 1060. Once all installed the screen was glitchy and difficult to watch. After a reboot it worked fine. Then I went upstairs and used it. While on, I brought it downstairs and it was like the display was stuck upstairs and I was beneath everything. You would think 6 reboots would fix it. Went upstairs and rebooted. Came downstairs and I wasn't 'beneath' everything again but damned screen jitters. It's just not smoot. I rebooted several times. I made sure graphics card was set to use dedicated graphics card for oculus. Doesn't work. Oh, and DON'T BUY the popular CLIMB game. I almost did cuz of the combo sale and saw a bunch of ppl saying the it doesn't work with oculus rift s. No replies from oculus on this at all. Anyway, seems like there are kinks. I'm disappointed and this junk is getting returned.  Hopefully they'll work out the kinks in a few months.Update - So the next day I went to use this and all worked fine again. There have been glitchy screen movements since. It kind of annoys me, though, because I'm somewhat afraid of keeping it in case the problem comes up again and I can't figure it out.Have had for couple of months now. It's cool when it works right, which is half the time. After a recent update, there was an issue with the left controller vibrating briefly and blinking non-stop when the batter was insterted - even with all else off. Support was worthless. I just happened to get it going after about 20 reboots and device re-adds. And now after a couple  of days of use, I go to use, and I'm back to a glitchy screen. There are tons of posts out there but no easy fix that I can find. Oh and then most of the time I use it, the controllers are totally misplaced in the view like behind me or above my head or some nonsense. Resetting the view doesn't work. You'd think that would reset the controller placement or whatever you call it, but nope. You have to pull the batteries out of the remote and wait a bit to re-install.Overall, this thing is too glitchy. Support knows about the issues and seem unable to fix it with canned responses like just reinstalling everything - which takes an hour or some other nonsense. Get at your own risk. I wish they sold this at Costco so I know I could return it at any time.

First thing to note:  If you are having issues with your Rift S connecting to your PC, try taking off the faceplate, disconnecting the cables from the Rift S itself, and then reconnecting the cables.  This didn't happen to me, but I've seen it fix issues with the headset for multiple other users.Setup was mostly straight-forward.  Installed the Oculus software.  During startup of the software, it got to a screen where it asked me to plug in the HDMI and two USBs for the sensors... which is, of course, not for the Rift S.  Skipping this screen (""Skip Setup"" button) cause a popup to appear asking if I wanted to set up my Rift S, which was already connected.  From there, everything was smooth.  Connections were confirmed, firmware on the headset and the controllers was updated (this took 10-15 minutes, iirc).  Then, we were good to go.The halo ring plus headstrap are comfortable to wear.  The controllers are extremely light, which makes them easy to move, but also feels a bit off from other controllers I've used.  I didn't notice much of a screen-door effect, but I also haven't tried staring at a solid block of color to try and spot it.  If you aren't looking for it, I don't think you'll even be aware of one.I booted up a few games, including Beat Saber, where the tracking was spot on.  I only had tracking issues in two cases:  Once when I was using a bow in Oculus Home, and the controller in front kept losing tracking due to the rear controller blocking the headset's view, and then again when I tried to look really closely at some of the items that I was picking up.Walking around was very comfortable, thanks to the Guardian ""curtain"" warning me when I was approaching my limits.  This might be one of my favorite QOL improvements (just behind the visual improvements).Overall, this is a good headset, with a good price-point.  You could do ""better"" for tracking with another headset that uses sensors, though, which is unfortunate, but makes this headset perfect for keeping things compact and tidy, while still performing very well.

I upgraded from the Gen 1 Oculus and man the difference in screen quality is night and day! It feels a lot better on my face than my original Oculus did, and the pass through feature is a must have now.The biggest selling point to me on the Rift S was that I don't have to set up sensors, it's all on the headset itself. The original issues on launch have since been fixed, and now I can't find any blind spots for tracking. It's near perfect!Now for the bad, the onboard sound is bad. Everyone says it's bad, I thought I would've been fine with it since I'm not picky or too overly snobby. For real though, I used the Rift sound from the headset and I ended up plugging in my earbuds about 4 minutes into playing. There is a headphone jack built into the Rift S though, so that's a plus :).Other than the things listed above, my overall score out of 10 would be 9/10. It woulda been a 10/10 if the sound was as good as Gen 1 Rift audio.Conclusion: If you are a seasoned VR player and have either the Original Rift or any other brand of VR, this is a steal for $400. If you are new to VR, then I say the same thing. Buy it! I had to dish out $700 for my Original Rift, which was nowhere as good as the Rift S! Just the built in tracking alone makes it so worth your money.WORD OF CAUTION: Please don't listen to those ignorant reviewers commenting on this product. It's their fault they didn't read what they needed to have on their Desktop/Laptop before purchasing. So I'm gonna say what anyone with half a brain will say: Please observe your desktop and look for at least 1 USB 3.0 port and 1 Display port. If you aren't tech savvy enough to know what those are then please utilize google. You literally have all of the world's knowledge at your fingertips, so please educate yourself and stop being ignorant about simple things. Cheers!

This was my first and so far only trip into VR, and I loved it, the unit is built well and runs with out much effort, just make sure your system can run VR games at a solid frame rate and you will be fine.  In 2020 though, there is not point, Get the Quest 2, it is better in pretty much every way to the Rift S, and will be supported longer.  Also do not forget the forced Facebook integration you must use in order to even operate the device, if you get banned from Facebook for anything what so ever, your VR headset is a paperweight and all your games are gone.

LOVE IT!!! I'm old, and I've been playing games since the Atari 2600 was the bomb.  Even played pong before that. After more than 40 years, everything was starting to get boring. Nothing was exciting me anymore. Then along came VR.Playing Beat Saber, Fallout 4, Skyrim, and Thrill of the Fight has not only made gaming fun again, I can justify it with getting a good workout in the case of BS and ToF. It's not perfect, but if you wait for perfect, you're squandering what will probably be years of entertainment before it is. There's a little setting up work to get everything working the way you want. Lots of reading forums on how to bet games to play the best and make your headset as comfortable as possible, but once everything gets dialed in, it's golden.Good:1. It's freaking awesome! I knew the moment I stood in the VR world just during the setup demo that this was the best $400 I've ever spent.2. Brings a whole new dimension to gaming. That being the third dimension. You aren't just pressing your nose against the glass and looking in at a new world, you're put inside it!3. It's not going to get a lot better any time soon, so if you think you want to go VR then do it now!4. Cost. Rift S is probably the best you can get in this price point.CONS:1. Front heavy. Takes some adjusting and even modding to get a really good fit and feel.2. The best way to enjoy it is to suspend the cables from the ceiling. This takes some work and a little money bot worth it.3. Cable extensions are a must if you want to enjoy anything close to a full room experience. Again, more cost, but not a lot.4. Get used to a drop in graphics quality. You're magnifying a screen so you'll see the tiny space between pixels more than you do a flat screen. AKA screen door effect. You get used to it. It's more noticeable on some games than other. For simple stuff like Beat Saber, you won't notice at all.5. Built in speakers are garbage. You simply can't get any decent sound from small speakers that don't tough your ears. You just can't, so Rift should either include attachable speakers (like they used to) or just drop them altogether and let the buyer attach their own.SUMMARY: The Rift S gives you the most for your money. You have to buy the Vive Pro (about another $300) to match what the Rift S gives you. There's another one I was looking at in this price range that may have had less screen door effect because it used LCD instead of OLED but the text wasn't as sharp. Most of my games use a lot of text, so that was important to me. The Rift S also has 5 camera sensors for better tracking. Another very important factor.ZERO PURCHASING REGRETS!

I have been completely blown away by the quality of the Rift S given it's $400 MSRP.  The price and quality of this headset make it THE headset to buy in 2020.  Any apprehensions I had about this device were completely smashed after my purchase and use.  Inside-Out Tracking/Room Scale.  Is the Rift S tracking as good as the Vive/Index that use multiple towers and outside-in tracking?  No, BUT, during gameplay is there any noticeable or meaningful differences in the Rift S?  Also no.  I don't know how Oculus has done it, but the tracking in this headset is phenomenal given you need no towers or outside sensors to dive into a VR title.  While it's not AS good as other methods if you really test it and look for flaws, you wont notice in normal gameplay and the Oculus' inside-out tracking makes it much more portable and easy to set up.  A definite win for this headset.  80hz Displays.  I game at 144hz on my desktop monitors and was expecting to find issue with the 80hz displays built into the Rift S.  Surprisingly, I rarely ever notice and when I do, it's the fault of my aging GPU causing hitching and not the displays.  Is it as good as the 120hz displays on the Index?  No, but it's also less than half the price.  Display Clarity/Quality.  I expected to have visual compromises in a $400 VR headset.  Imagine my surprise to find that the Rift S looks MILES better than the HTC Vive.  The ""screen door effect"" of this headset is very, very minimal, and the picture is much clearer than expected.  About the only time I've ever found myself squinting because it was hard to see was on the rare occasions that I'd be tinkering with settings in a browser or application while mirroring my desktop in VR.  Halo Strap.  I didn't think it would be comfortable, but it is hands down the best VR strap I've ever used.  But, there is a learning curve to figuring out the proper way to put this headset on so that it's comfortable and fits well - be sure to do some reading online because Oculus does a poor job of explaining the best way to use this somewhat unintuitive headset strap.  Once you find the proper fit, you'll be able to play for hours comfortably.  Durability.  As soon as I opened the Rift S I immediately became apprehensive of the durability of the Halo strap, mounting point of the display to the Halo strap, and thick kink-prone cables.  The concerns I had with the Halo strap and mounting point for the headset are all but gone after many on/off repetitions and a few hard bumps.  Inevitably, the cable will get kinks, but it's thick, sturdy, and has survived being yanked out of the top of the headset display a couple of times.  At the end of the day, I'm satisfied that the Rift S will last years.  Worst case, if it doesn't, the halo strap can be replaced for $60 and the cable for $80 (both are available to purchase from the Oculus website).  Built-in Speakers.  Me, before buying the Rift S: ""How can tiny speakers built into the strap of a headset sound like anything but complete garbage?  At least I can plug my good Shure earbuds into it.""  Me after buying the Rift S:  ""I'd rather use the built-in speakers than mess with headphones and cables.""  Are the built-in speakers bass-thumping mad-houses?  Absolutely not.  But the sound is very crisp and clear, has plenty of volume, and the positional audio is surprisingly great.Other Observations:  Camera View - You can set a shortcut so that the double-tap of the menu button turns on the exterior camera view, this comes in handy.  Controllers - I expected these to be better than the god-awful Vive wands, they are.  These controllers are comfortable and intuitive.  Battery-powered is a plus, they tend to last for a couple weeks with heavy use and only 1 AA battery is needed per controller.  Storage - I recommend getting a small case to store this headset in, due to the long cable and multiple peripherals it'll quickly clutter up your computer desk/office.  It's very easy to set up/teardown because there is only one cable to plug in and no towers.  Steam Integration - This headset integrates with Steam VR pretty seamlessly, and built-in access to the Oculus store is a plus.  Displayport REQUIRED:  Read the fine print people.  You MUST have Displayport in order to plug in and use this headset.  This should not be an issue with most modern desktop GPUs.Overall:  If you are thinking about getting a VR headset and don't want to blow the budget, get the Rift S.

Have had many issues with the headsets cameras loosing tracking and the pass-through showing static and cutting out. The displays are fine and constantly show images and the menu systems but there is something severely wrong with the USB 3.0 connection. I have opened a support ticket and am going through trouble shooting steps but if this isn't fixed before the end of my return window I am going to just get a refund. Which is really disappointing because when it DOES work it is an extraordinary experience. This is my first VR headset, I did a lot a research before pulling the trigger to buy it. I was aware of some of the issues but because it was being discontinued and offered at $299 I figured the cost was reasonable for the capabilities. I even can overlook the Facebook requirement because I do use Facebook for business and I don't care that much about them tracking what games I play or any metrics about my VR experiences. I also am hoping that the OpenHMD project will someday have positional tracking support for the Rift S and I won't have to rely on the Oculus Software to run the headset. That alone made it a better option over the Quest 2 and the price made it a better option over the Vive, HP Reverb, and Index. The only headset I seriously considered was the Pimax but it doesn't have inside out tracking and relies on the Vive style sensors. Binocular effect on my vision is noticeable and there is a little bit of lens reflection on text and sharp lines but once you have the headset adjust for the sweet spot its very immersive and I don't notice it as much. I can definitely see the pixels on the screen but they are hardly visible. I'd imagine a higher priced headset would have a much better fov and resolution but at a quarter of the cost this is fine with me. I just wish I could figure out how to make the issues with tracking go away, I have maybe gotten 2 hours at a time of playable VR experience before it start acting up but most of the time it just isn't playable. I'll update more as I go. Not that it matters since this is going to be discontinued by Facebook in favor of stand alone walled garden headsets like the Quest.

Score you buy this, just make sure you don’t need to also buy an upgraded graphic card like I did. We weren’t able to play it right away. But when you do, it’s so worth it. Super cool. And I’m a 36 year old non gamer mom. Lol.  Go online real quick and look at the requirements to run this VR Rift, then match it to your settings-> about list. Yes, it’s pricey, but, my daughter was able to play Roblox in VR!! She was super popular  in the game, instantly, for having one.... she was super stoked.  I wish they weren’t so expensive, as I’d buy one for each kid. Had it for maybe a year (can’t remember exactly) and it still functions properly. Oh, you also need the correct port. One is a USB, the other is a special port, can’t remember the name but my laptop did not have it. We had to use my desktop.

I'm one of those owners of the Oculus Rift, and was looking to upgrade. I decided to try out the Rift S, as it's supposed to be a great upgrade. Tried a few things, and here's my results.PROS:- Graphics are a massive upgrade, and it shows. Fantastic upgrade from the Rift, and the lack of ""fish-eye"" is a plus.CONS:- The halo strap is quite uncomfortable, and constantly needs adjusting for my head. There is no replacement or alternative, save for modding the heck out of it.- The audio is a massive downgrade, going from barely audible to (with the use of an external headset) quite unbearable. Not much on the middle ground.- The tracking and controls are the worst part. The inside out tracking of this headset is slow and painful, making playing games other than social apps unbearable.All in all, I returned it and went back to my ""downgraded"" Rift until I can find a real PCVR replacement, since Facebook/Oculus is now abandoning the Rift line in favor of the Quest.

PROS ......The display quality on the Rift S is excellent and smooth.Built in audio is decent, but you can use your own headphones for better sound.Lens doesn't fog.Haven't noticed any screen door effect yet.Comfortable fit and not heavy.Oculus software is top notch.Enough quality Free and Demo games/content to give you a great experience.Also, works with Steam VR.The touch controllers work very well.Tracking is very good, and no external tracking needed. Haven't had any major issues yet.Lack of physical IPD adjustment hasn't affected me. The software seems to do it's job for me.CONS ...The single cable that feeds the display port and usb 3.0 port is a thick and heavy cable. Not a big deal though.Can't set the Guardian to warn you in smaller play spaces.You have to readjust the back knob on the headset everytime you put it on.Overall the Rift S is a great experience with just minor cons.My PC is Ryzen 2700x, GTX 1080ti.

Love the VR experience, especially in flight simulation!  Runs pretty well on my i7 9700 with GTX2070 super.  But, the headset is heavy and the cord is an annoyance and gets twisted.  This is a great entry-level rig to get started, and I will upgrade as the technology improves.Update:  3 mos. later the Rift S has failed.  After 30+ emails with tech support, repeatedly testing the software, and a week duration, I went to Amazon.  Amazon was awesome of course, and I was able to return it.  Oculus came back with an offer to replace the device with a ""refreshed"" model and I refused.  I want my VR now, and since Oculus is the best in the low-end price range, I got an Oculus Quest 2 instead.  It is a much better unit, and runs everything wirelessly.  A different hardware manufacturer as well, so I expect no similar problems (I hope).

I knew next to nothing about VR, didn't care about it, didn't want to try it, blah. But I had a gaming PC that could definitely power it and got curious. So i picked this up one day just to give it a shot (thought about getting the quest but I like those great graphics) for $350.From a complete VR noob who had never tried it before:Pros: - Really REALLY cool experience. Love the feeling of interactivity and depth. There's something so innately amazing about *touching* things in a game with your hands. It cannot be replicated and you cannot imagine it without actually trying it. - Amazingly creative games! I can't believe I can shoot arrows realistically, and VERY accurately as well! - You really get a workout playing some of these! If you wanted this to be your morning workout it very easily could be. - Seems like it won't get outdated terribly soon... but who knows, VR seems to be gaining traction finally! - Great fitting mechanisms, though I don't like the top strap because it feels like there's too many ways to adjust it to get the same result and thus you're never really sure if it's on ""right"" - REALLY good tracking for both controllers and your room. I like the passthrough view and ""safe"" area designation. - All games run great so far, display's refresh rate has never seemed to be an issue (though I'll always be glad for a higher one!) and I have not encountered any performance issues in any games yet. (GTX 1070, i7-7700k)Neutrals: - Cable kinda sucks. It's heavy and gets in the way a lot. I know there are ways to help with this but they're not convenient or available for everyone. - It's not as immersive as I thought it would be. Yes, you feel like you're in the world, but it's very obvious that you're not. You have a very limited FOV (and I'm certain it's this way for all VR headsets) and it looks like you're looking through scuba gear. It's really distracting and kind of a shame. - The screen door effect is noticeable. You can get past it, it's not bad, but it's definitely there and I can't wait until we get the technology to completely eliminate it. I think this is the #1 thing that would make the immersion better.Cons: - Really bad god rays, especially once you get used to using the headset. I can't get them to go away, especially bad on high contrast screens (dark games). Otherwise it's not that noticeable at all. - No IPD adjustment. Since this is my first headset I can't say whether the weird ""blurriness"" of everything is on my end or if that's just how VR is at this point, but everything is so hard to focus on and nothing looks sharp, especially closer to my face. Everything just feels *slightly* off, and there's not a lot you can do to fix that if it's an IPD issue. - Weight balance is absolutely terrible. Buy some wheel weights and stick them on the back of the headband. Your face will thank you. - $350 is a lot, especially when it doesn't come with any games. I feel like this is the tipping point headset that will only get better for cheaper, to the point where it'll rival home consoles. When it gets there, it'll be a great value.Overall, if you're into VR and wanna try it out but don't want to sacrifice visual fidelity and you have a PC to power it, GET IT! If you want to try VR and don't mind the graphics or don't have a PC, get the Oculus Quest instead.This VR headset is amazing, but overall I'm not ""amazed"". It has, however, made me much more interested in the future of VR and I can't wait until it does amaze me, when the immersion is perfected and the visuals are clearer!PS. The oculus program/software is a nightmare. Worst setup experience of my life. But don't let the occasional software finagling turn you away.

Got this headset for my son and we are both blown away. The value you get for the price is what we have been waiting for to make the jump to VR. The fact that the tracking is camera based also makes for a much easier setup.  Some reviews mentioned that the tracking was not accurate, however I saw no problems.  The setup did take a little while, but it was very intuitive.  The remote controllers are very responsive as well. We tried the Playstation VR, and this headset is definitely on par if not better.  I was able to jump into BeatSaber and pass two of the levels on hard setting and I am 44 years old.  We look forward to exploring all of the other VR titles now!The one issue we encountered so far was the battery door on the remotes. It would start to slide off even though we had the wrist straps fully tightened.  Perhaps I need to find a proper hand placement with more use.  I do have really big hands as I am 6' 3"".Son's PC SetupCore i5 oc to 4ghzMSI GTX 1080ti

At the start installing the software makes your computer buggy, the first connection crashed my gtx1060. Then connecting your headset was trash, tried all usb ports and switching Display ports and after reinstalling and driver changes, beta updating, etc. I was able to connect but the SENSORS CANNOT CONNECT and my camera use was enabled and retrying it soon made it work. Again to controls the first time it did not work but later on they always connect. Now I am a square one at connecting, and when I was able to connect the vive either it kept connecting and disconnecting(The vive usb was the only thing connected so it was not a power issue and my motherboard is using 10th gen intel), and the other problem is seeing the loading dots which I have no idea to fix. Giving it a few weeks of testing and if not I'm am returning this trash vive that ALSO requires you to connect with FACEBOOK which collects your data. My data is collected and I'm ended up with a non-working vive because of their trash software.

Replaced the original Oculus Rift and am happy that I did.Pros:- No more motion sensors, YAY- Setup is easy (NOTE: This has a DisplayPort adapter, don't buy it if you don't have a DisplayPort connector on your video card)- Display is better (not a huge jump, but noticeable)- The headset is more comfortable- The controllers are much better in my opinion- Responsiveness is improved- Haven't had a chance to setup the Guardian sensors, but if it works as stated, a cool additionCons- Sound isn't awesome- Can't fit my headphones with the headset, but I may try to find some that may fit. Earbuds still work fine tho- Fogged up quickly, but I think that's because it's a little tighter fit around your face. Have solved that problem by tinkering a little (mostly)- Cords could be a little longerOverall, I highly recommend this, especially if you are buying your first one. Should you upgrade from the original? I'm glad that I did, but $400 may not be worth it for some.

Build quality is a downgrade form the older CV1 Rift especially the Touch controllers.  But the Halo band is nice, the optics are fantastic and getting rid of 3 15' sensor cables make for a more stream lined VR system.There are a few 'new release' issues going on right now though that some people are having to deal with such as the black screen of death or the static issues or people jsut not realizing this HMD needs a displayport port not an hdmi (and you can't adapt HDMI to DP either).And really cramming all this bandwidth and power on a single USB cable is causing some issues, I'd recommend if you have a USB3.1 Gen2 port to use that for Rift S.  if you just have a USB3 or 3.1g1 it's going to pull the maximum it can out of that port which is partially the cause of the black screen of death.I upgraded from CV1 to S and I love it, the tracking is Adequate but there are some dead zones you will run into for certain games at least right now. Maybe there will be work-arounds for that later with game updates or firmware updates.  And Steam VR right now seems to be hit or miss , Valve needs to drop some updates for S as well.Overall happy i upgraded.  It's a serviceable mid-generation hardware refresh think like launch xbox one to xbox one s.

This headset is amazing. It runs great on my laptop with GTX2070 and 16 gigs of ram. I've never had an issue with hand tracking, even when reaching behind my back. The headset has built in speakers and mic, but it's small enough so you could use a wireless headset over it if you wanted. The headset let's you set up a guardian ""wall"" around you so if you get to close to it it all turns red, so you don't slap your cat to Mars on accident.A small bit of advice, if you get hot or sweat easily like me. Get a fan and put it in your room with you. Also DO NOT let sunlight hit the lenses of the headset, it will burn your screen.Small gripes I have with it. To use oculus you MUST have a facebook account. Which I think is stupid,  however not a big deal to make a fake account and not use it. Also, since I use a laptop I have a Mini Display Port. The Oculus provides the adapter from mini to normal, however I broke it relatively easy by tugging on my mouse cord that was somehow wrapped around it. (My fault not oculus). If you plan on using Steam VR it gets kind of buggy. You'll want to join your friends chat on your computer, then put on your headset and open steam VR through the oculus app. (Also not oculus fault). Other than those things. It's amazing. I'd reccomend it to anyone.

The product used to be decent but forced driver/firmware updates have broken it. Oculus cannot figure out how to fix their software and refuse to go back to the last one that worked. Read their official forums and Reddit site. There are more people trying to fix their Rift S than there are playing it. Each new update fixes one thing and breaks another. Their support also is no help and isn't even aware of the multitude of problems that are currently plaguing the Rift.Beyond the bugs the hardware provides very detailed images which are much higher in detail than the CV1. Everything about the visuals is an improvement with the major exception of the depth of blacks. The Rift S simply cannot produce anything close to a solid black. Everything appears dark grey with no contrast. Some parts of games are literally impossible to play correctly because you cannot see objects in dark areas.  This single issue almost makes the CV1 still the superior headset.Tracking is the other major downside. The inside/out tracking works well generally but fails if you move too quickly or too slowly, too far out from your headset or too close, or if you keep it steady for too long. Tracking is simple to setup but no where near as functional as the CV1 was.I used to be a loyal customer but I'm not sure I could ever recommend an Oculus headset to anyone again. At the very least, now is the worst possible time to buy. Wait until they hopefully get their drivers/firmware fixed.

I've had this headset for about 10 weeks now.  From day 1 whenever I turn my computer on, the headset will not work unless I reseat the USB cable, after that it would work fine.  Oculus support could not resolve the issue and had me jumping through hoopes hoping I would give up.  It eventually worked and I gave up....until about 8 weeks in, then it started crashing during games after 5 - 10 minutes of play time.  Now the headset is completely unusable, again Oculus support is having me jump through hoops, and now they are not responding at all.  I wish I had not bought this on Amazon with my gift card.  Had I paid through a credit card, I might have some way of getting my money back.  Waste of $400.  Would not buy from Oculus again.

My first and only VR headset so I've nothing to judge this against, but I have few complaints. There are times when I get what is apparently a common fault, black screens for no reason. There's a simple fix, but it's still a nuisance and happens a bit too often. On the plus side, the image is great, not razor sharp because headsets aren't advanced enough yet, but easily good enough to enjoy. The range of apps and games is wide. The Displayport cable is a nuisance as I had to get a USB-C adapter for the laptop end. No great problem. I also extended both the Displayport cable and the USB cable by 9 feet using a powered USB hub and a powered Displayport extender, and that makes it easier to get around without tripping over the cables.Now here's the BIG MOAN: I have a wide pupilliary distance (PD) and the headset doesn't, the lenses are fixed for people whose eyes are closer together. There is supposed to be some software compensation for that, but it's not noticeable to me. The result of this is that the lenses are sharpest closer to the nose than my eyes, and there's nothing I can do about it other than jiggle the headset around until I get the best compromise. I gather that Oculus did this knowing that more than 40% of users would have difficulties and newer headsets will be no better. The original Rift, I gather, had physical adjustment for the lenses and Oculus just couldn't be bothered to continue the idea on into newer headsets. Most games and video don't give me huge issues with this, but text is really a challenge and anything very small likewise. I have to move my head around too much. Ultimately for the sheer pleasure and fun to be had from VR, these are minor grievances and I only knocked off one star for them.Lastly I got used to the headset and don't find it at all uncomfortable or too heavy even after hours of use. But some people do have problems with the weight on their faces, especially if they have sinus conditions, so if you're likely to be in that group be prepared for some hand modding of the parts that touch your face and the headstrap to help make the headset more comfortable and distribute the pressure better.

The Oculus Rift S has the right idea with the inside out tracking. Having to setup various sensors (like on the previous rift) was a pain, but worked well enough. The problem was the amount of USB ports it consumed, as well as running many cords throughout the room. So far some of the games don't work as well, but when I mess with certain games they run as smooth as can be. I beleive with a few patches this will be perfect, since it just seems that the problems are minor, and can be tuned through software updates.some Pros:-Much clearer visuals. I can read signs in game, and everything looks much more clear.-Better head-strap. Easy to readjust when someone else wants to try it. Not much explaining.-Portabliity. I can easily take this to a friends place without having to take and resetup the sensors.some cons:-some games aren't adjusted right just yet (although all VR headsets had problems initially).-Great audio gone. Apparently they will try and remedy this with an update, but you can use your own headphones.I've read that many don't fit on it, so do your research before you buy a pair.-Display port connector. You must have a display port to make this work. You can get an adapter, but I have not tried this.-IPD problems. I have not had any myself,  but people that have eyes more widely spread apart (the distance between pupils)should make sure that they can use this without issue.

Ok first off, I had the Rift before this S model, so this is somewhat of a comparison.The Rift S is definitely more comfortable than it's predecessor. The foam is soft and it seems a tad lighter. I wear glasses, and the S does not rest on them as much as the last generation, which is good. I can spend much more time using the Rift S because it's comfort is that much better. The S also slips on and off my face a lot easier than the last generation and I have a large head, being 6'5"" @ 275lbs.It is great that it does not use external sensors to track movement, because it is just far less cumbersome and more of a simple plug and play device now. I have an Acer Predator 17, which has a display port, but the Rift S does come with an adapter if yours does not.The controllers are the same size and weight, which is really good. They are far less bulky than it's competitors, which makes using the VR much more enjoyable in my opinion.Headset tracking of itself is flawless, it is right on when you move your head around. However, I do get headset out of bounds type messages just looking around sometimes and that is annoying.Eye relief, I don't really know about. I've adjusted it to max (72) and least and noticed zero difference in anything.The bad news.External tracking of the controllers is glitchy and glitchy a lot. You no longer have a fine tracking experience that is so smooth, as it was in the previous Rift. Your hands in the VR like to twitch, jump and sometimes freeze. It's not 100% of the time that it does this, but it happens frequently enough to be bothersome. The rest of the time it is smooth and responsive.Optics. This is where the Rift S falls even shorter, in my experience. For starters, your field of view has reduced and it is not quite as immersive as the previous Rift. For example, it is as though you are looking through toilet paper tubes now, as there are large black areas of nothing surrounding the visual field. Tunnel vision.  Although the experience is still fun, I am very disappointed in this, as it has lost some of it's VR experience as a result.The resolution is supposed to be higher, but I do not see that at all. Fonts are still grainy and it is too similar to the last Rift to say that there is much, if any improvement in resolution.The screen brightness is less in the Rift S, so it loses points for that. Although still pretty vibrant, it's just lacking something I can't exactly put my finger on.Overall, it is a step back from the Rift in the critical areas a VR should be and a step forward in comfort and convenience. It all depends on what is more important to you.

I want to start of with this review saying the Rift S is AMAZING and I love it to death, Its such a huge bump up in graphics compared to my CV1 (Original Rift) and the tracking was pretty much the same compared to my 4 sensor set up from my old Rift. So why the 2 stars? I have an IPD of 68.5, Oculus recommends the Rift S for users with IPD of 61.5-65.5, so when I put  on the headset if I look straight ahead everything is nice and clear,however everything on the side is blurry and you get what appears to be a constant God ray and everything is always blurry around the sides (Think putting on someone else glasses) and it eventually causes my eyes to strain and hurt and then I eventually start getting sick from it. The software IPD can adjust to fix some of the issues with users seeing the side of the screen and such but since the lenses are fixed in place my issue cant be fixed. I thought long and hard about returning it because I love this headset so much but ultimately if its making me sick every time I use it then there is no sense keeping it. If your IPD falls between the recommend specs than I highly recommend getting the Rift S, if you fall outside the specs that I advise you go and try a headset before you buy. I still find it hard to believe Oculus allowed the Rift S to not have an IPD slider.........

This is not ready for primetime. We have owned the original HTC Vive for some time and it is an amazing experience. My son was excited to try this one and when we got it he got it set up right away. He spent several days tweaking our computer settings but the headset kept going blank and resetting. We also discovered a flaw in the design where the cord that attaches to the headset kept pulling out. We even attached a velcro strap to help prevent that. The inside out tracking was cool but the glitches just weren't great. We have two gaming computers and it did the same thing on both. This is a good low budget VR headset but please don't think this is as good as VR gets. It isn't! High end VR headsets make a huge difference if you can afford it. I would say to save up a little more and go with the better units out there.

This is an amazing VR headset. I played the original rift and had an awful experience. It was blurry and barely fit right, so I was nervous in getting this. But man, did they really step up there game. No annoying sensors to put around your room, everything is crystal clear to the point where my brain loses a grip on reality. The built in speakers are a nice touch! However I prefer using headphones, but it’s nice if you need to hear the world outside. I have an 2700x and rx480 and my pc runs all games perfectly at max settings! Seriously the best $400 I have ever spent, I couldn’t be happier. Only complaint is I get motion sick easy and playing this makes me sick after 30 minutes but I haven’t owned this long so I imagine it will improve over time and Dramamine seemed to pretty much eliminate that issue. Seriously though, the bad reviews from people who are butthurt because it didn’t fit their VR ready laptops should be removed. It is not the company’s fault you didn’t take 5 minutes out of your time to do the research to see if it would work for your computer.

This was my first dive into VR, and so far I'm really happy with it.If you're like I was -waiting anxiously for the Amazon delivery - I would recommend you go and download Oculus, because it *does* take a while and *is* required. In fact no other VR applications will work unless you have Oculus running.Something else I discovered when installing Oculus is that they weren't kidding when they say Windows 10 is required. It wasn't a huge deal to update, but it did delay the fun of getting to use the Rift.Finally installed the headset, went through installation, and all is well! I really enjoyed the setup tutorials, and it does a remarkably good job of tracking where you and your hands are without any external sensors. Robo Recall was a fantastic game to get acquainted with VR (even though I got too enthusiastic once or twice and punched a bookshelf on the edge of my boundary), and some of the driving simulators I used didn't make me as nauseous  as I thought they would.. flying space-ships can get a little intense, however.The only thing I would note about the tracking is that it does *not* work in a room without lights on - it'll make you either turn the lights on or set up for a ""new environment""

UPDATE: 5/30/19 After five or so hours I finally managed to get it to work. Issue was with my computer having two different graphics drivers. I did a clean and full uninstall of all drivers related to graphics and reinstalled for a third time the most up to date graphics driver, along with BIOS for motherboard.Once it was operable I was amazed at what I could do. Setting boundaries was already cool to me and not even into the games yet, which was an easy thing to do. Once I got into the games the real entertainment began. Occasionally the tracking system would get wacky and start to display everything in an epileptic manner but would either snap out of it or would have me reset boundaries. I was easy to do though.This product is recommended by me. Especially for those who are already into gaming or to those looking for an immersive experience. This is an awesome concept and hope it only continues to improve. I highly recommend playing around with Google Earth VR.5/28/19Unable to use for now, issue with driversI will update this review if and when I am able to use the product. Would like to mention I paid for one day shipping and received it today (four days later). Was excited to open and plug it in. The find out I need to install Oculus home program for it to work. Not a big deal. Then I get an error message pertaining to graphics driver. I have spent hours following the online support pages and after nu-installing and re- installing i still get a message referring to drivers Oculus having a problem with graphics drivers. Contacting support will be one to two business days before I get a reply.

 UPDATED REVIEW ON 8-10-2020: Ok so from day one i had constant software issues and hardware issues. So i reinstalled windows 10 because it was time to do that anyways because my pc was acting up a lot not just with this. So i reinstalled windows it fixed the software issues with oculus. But then the hardware issues still was there. So after months of troubleshooting being back and forth with oculus support with no fixes but asking to RMA the whole vr rift s. I have figured out it is the cable being defective from day one. I bought this vr headset last year in October of 2019. So i then replaced the cable it fixed all the hardware issues. But i still had lag when it was not supposed to lag and still had a few tracking issues. So i then installed oculus tray tool and turned off all usb power savings completely. Now it runs smooth and does not lag at all anymore and there is no tracking issues at all anymore. It always ran smooth with no lag what so ever after i did that. So i have been using it for like 3 months more till i got my valve index. In that time after fixing it. The Oculus Rift s ran perfectly fine and i had no issues at all out of it. The audio is really bad on the rift s so i use a pair of skullcandy earbuds i bought for it which fixed the really bad audio quality. I also bought a modmic and just flat out disabled the garbage mic the rift s vr headset mic it has. I used the oculus rift s for quite a while. The controllers were super durable and they still work perfectly fine. I have like nearly 2K hours on the vr headset and controllers. The cable is new i bought a new cable for it 3 months ago because it was bad since day one and i did not know it was. The rift s vr headset still works very well to this day. Never had a single issue out of it after reinstalling windows 10, using oculus tray tool, and getting a new cable for it. But i since then i got my valve index vr headset a week ago so i have been using that. So i plugged in the oculus rift s again and it still works great. You should get one too they work quite well. The mic and built in headphones is not great on the rift s. But hey it is something to start out and to try VR with. Also as of right now the rift s is the best Inside out tracking PC VR headset there is as of right now. I hope this info helped you.

Coming from the original CV1 Rift and yes absolutely worth the upgrade. If for only one reason the Screen Door Effect is nearly gone. The one thing that always bothered me about my original Rift. The slight increase in resolution leads a lot of original Rift owners to think that its not enough for an upgrade but the combination of the new screen and lenses makes all the difference in the world. I can see text clearly, see further, God Rays and glare are almost completely eliminated too. Just a totally different experience. The 80Hz max is not a noticeable issue either. I think less eye strain due to the improved overall clarity really helps. Even though its a slightly slower screen I get less motion sick because I can relax my eyes more. Then there the new fit which is miles more comfortable and the weight is much more well balanced. I still get sweaty but the my neck never gets tired.. first world problems.. Tracking is better then expected which was a concern. I can go behind my shoulders briefly and the sensors seem to predict movement really well so no problems there. Setup was a breeze only takes about 5 minutes after a firmware update. There are a couple cons which I will list below.Cons: Okay so you've read and heard that the new Headphone-less built in speakers suck.. Well yeah compared to a $100 pair of cans sure they suck. They lack bass and don't get very loud. I wouldn't have a problem using them in a pinch but they are definitely this headsets biggest shortcoming. However there is a headphone jack on the headset so use whatever headphones you want. Another gripe of mine is to get as close as possible to the lenses for the best FOV you have to really ratchet the headband pretty tight. It has notches and if I ratchet to far it backs itself off so I can't get as close as I want. I wish there was an easy mod but the face foam is pretty thin already so thats a no go. FOV is similar on most other VR headsets except for the PIMAX 5K/8K. Last little nit-pick is that I'm not in love with the new Touch Controllers. I really liked the CV1 design and balance. These while lite enough are slightly more top heavy.Final thoughts,, So I orders this Rift S and a Samsung Odyssey Plus with plans on keeping one of them. I spent one evening with the Odyssey Plus and was like ""Meh"". OLED screens have amazing contrast and color but the lenses and sweet spot were garbage. It gets so blurry looking even slight off center where as the Rift S has a much larger sweet spot and text looks crisp even on the edges of the screen. And comfort wise it was nowhere near as good as Rift S so the Samsung is getting returned. For $399 its less then half the price of Valve Index and most certainly NOT half the experience. If you are new to VR or just what a noticeable upgrade from Gen 1 headsets the Rift S is a great choice.

This thing requires half a dozen restarts to work each time i use it. It has to be the worst piece of hardware I have used in over 15 years. It will somehow not see the display port (yet displays video in the head set) or the USB is not detected yet somehow the controllers are, or the motion sensors fail to register. I love VR, just wish I knew how bad this head set was when I bought it, would have spent the extra money for the HTC.The headset when it does work is great. Only reason it gets two stars.The bands are not easily removable so washing them is a pain, need aftermarket covers.Support is horrible, not even worth the calls. Took them over a week to get back to me telling me to reload the software and do an update, as if that wouldnt be the first thing i tried. Three more weeks of back and forth and I gave up on them and turned to Reddit.All of this would make me tell people to stay away, but now you need to send all your data to FB to make it work, wouldnt go with this unit now.

The VR effect is something that you have to see to believe.  It is AMAZING..!Because the Oculus Rift S connects to a PC, there is already a very large library of very affordable VR games and programs that are available for it.  It can also run VR programs from ""Steam"" that were designed for the HTC Vive system.I already have a strong gaming PC but I had to upgrade the USB ports before I could use the Oculus Rift S.  I strongly urge anyone that is thinking of buying this, to run the ""OculusCompatCheck.exe"" program on your system, to make sure your system can handle the Oculus Rift-S.  (You can download the OclulusCompatCheck.exe rom the Oculus web page.)

I have wanted a VR system for a LONG time.  I first played VR almost 30 years ago (yes, it's been around that long) and was excited to have VR in my home!  I've actually been collecting games for the Oculus Rift for a few years now, even though I didn't have a system.Well, I got the system, and it works, and it's cool and all, but there are a few things I would make better on it.First and most importantly, make it better to use for people with glasses!  If you wear glasses, you can still get your head in, but it will hurt after a while.  The system is not designed for wearing glasses in it, and you WILL need your glasses while playing.Next, I have had some compatibility issues with games (I know, that's the developers fault).  Sucks to buy a game and it says it works with the Rift S and it just doesn't.  Granted, my video card is the bare minimum, but all my other equipment far exceeds requirements.Some games work fantastic.  Skyrim VR is WONDERFUL! Yet, Fallout 4VR is abismal (do not buy it).  There are some great games (best saber) and some that just don't work (many of the inexpensive games on Steam that say they will).I'm running a decent system, but my video card is a 1050 and is the minimum. Yet, the games that work are amazing!  Pinball FX in VR is awesome, as is Skyrim, Beat Saber, and a few others.The comfort is the biggest problem, then the randomness in which games either rock, or flat out stink, even when they run on the same engine and are by the same comapany!  Looking at you Bethesda!Overall, I love it, but there's room for improvement.  I'll update this as I use it more and have had it for a longer time.

This is my full real-world experience at home with a computer VR headset and I have to say, this headset was pretty darn incredible.  The inside-out tracking system was a big time saver and worked surprisingly well and consistently.My computer is decently powerful (i7-3770k, 16gb RAM, RTX 2060) and didn't have a problem keeping up with the frame rates required of this headset but playing for more than 15 mins resulted in a quasi-nauseous feeling.  Also, not sure if this issue was unique to me but the Oculus Rift software was a tiny bit buggy and so was the SteamVR and other VR application experience.  They would often crash or simply not recognize the Rift S even though the Rift software recognized the headset was connected.  This happened about half the time which often required me to restart my computer.  It's possible the issue was unique to my computer but I tried multiple USB inputs with roughly the same result.The sound was surprisingly good for built-in headphones but not wonderful.  Unfortunately, there isn't enough room to use anything but alternate in-ear headphones as there's no room for anything else.The screen/image quality was my biggest problem with this system.  While this was only my first VR headset, the screens were not adjustable and were slightly horizontally off center for my eyes.  The screens had a significant screen-door effect also which resulted in a fair amount of disorientation and eye strain.Overall this was a very interesting showing for a VR product and I feel like slight improvements and tracking, along with much better pixel density might be enough to make this a viable product for the masses.  Otherwise, I am very interested to see what the next generation product will look like to see if that might quell my only remaining concerns (nausea effect and screen clarity).

For the price the gameplay and functionality is not bad, however This VR system requires you to be online and logged into facebook to be able to use it. In addition if facebook ever goes down ""like it is now"" you cannot use it at all rendering it a paperweight. The headset itself is lower resolution than my monitor which really sucks, and please be careful of prolonged use because it will destroy your short range vision. Transitions from oculus interface to games, or between screens in games regularly include flashing white lights which can be blinding and painful. All in all this is one of the worst VR systems dont buy this one.

Right now, I'm going to give this 3 stars.The positive. The build quality on the rift S is solid,  the controllers, light weight and so far, work pretty well. The system when it works, works fairly well but not perfect. I have an Alienware desktop and a dual  Video, VR ready setup, more then ample.The not so good. Coming from PS4VR which has a cable to the unit attached,  I opted to go with the Rift S because it wasnt an issue on the Sony unit, the rift setup, wants you to have a minimum of a 6.5 x 6.5 play area, yet,  provides a cable, barely long enough to accommodate that. Some content asks for whole room use.....this  is a major  negative in my book, if you are limited to sitting only content.Additionally,  the cable provided, is extremely heavy and non ply-able for this application. And the weight of the cable, pulls down on the VR unit.Another negative, is the vast majority of content is pay to play, and not a $5.00 price tag. But most content, over $30 and, the pay to play fees charged from Oculas, for use on the gear VR, doesn't transfer,  much of that content isnt yet available. But, this is a software issue more then the unit issue. I'm not new to VR, I own a PS4 VR and I also have a Samsung Gear VR. Both of these devices are currently better deals. Especially the gear VR with a controller. Perhaps the cordless Rift is a better alternative to the Rift S. But you would assume that something that plugs into  a high end Gaming PC, would have more upgradability and longevity.The recent firmware update, has also seemed to make the unit a bit more buggy,  as after doing the update. I had several glitches, that require a total system reboot, several times to get everything back online.At best, when the firmware issues are worked out, this can move to 4 stars, but unless a cable extension is made available, sadly, this wont ever get to 5.

UPDATE 12/28/19It seems that since my original review, that the tracking has improved SIGNIFICANTLY!!  Si decided to give it another go in the past few weeks and since that time the tracking has been GREAT!! I have had it get stuck once in that time and a restart of the software worked, unlike a full system restart previously.I am quite happy with my purchase and am considering buying another in the future. Kudos to the updates from Oculus to fix these issues.***ORIGINAL*** Nov. 2019First the good:Excellent quality lenses. Very clear. Excellent smooth gameplay. Nice seal on the hmd, and while many complained about the speakers I personally enjoy them because I like to hear my surroundings. The small size of the controllers is also a plus.The bad:In a word, tracking. It loses tracking consistently. i dont mean that they dissapear from the screen but that they they get stuck while playing any game, especially those that require quick movement..i.e beat saber, first person tennis, fallout 4 VR, Skyrim VR etc...It happens so often that it just becomes unusable. I have since gone back to using my HP mixed reality set, while these lose tracting at times, it at least recovers. Unlike the Rift S, which require a system restart (restarting the software doea not work) to work again and then only works briefly.I have tried every kind of fix and it seems the updates aren't fixing the issue either. So, with that said..I can't recommend the Rift S.

I just returned this product for a refund, the hardware seemed to be OK, but I never really got the chance to test it. The problem is that Oculus equipment requires a Facebook account. I tried to set up a Facebook account, but after filling in the required information and setting a password, I got a pop-up informing me that my account had been suspended for violating Facebook's policies. I've never tried to sign up for a Facebook account or even had anything to do with them before this, so why did they suspend my account? Who knows, because when I tried to use their appeal process, I was asked to submit a personal photo and provide invasive documents with personal information? I originally bought this product as a cost-effective way to get into VR, but the privacy issues and aggravation were just not worth it. If you already have a Facebook account and privacy is not an issue, then this might be the system for you. But if giving up your privacy is not an option and you don't want to deal with this type of aggravation, then stay well clear of anything Oculus. As for me, I purchased this because it was a VR system I could afford. For $299 VR is cool, but VR is just not $600 plus cool, I plan to wait until VR becomes more main-stream and the prices come down.

I would highly advice to steer clear from the rift S. I purchased 3 (full house)We struggled for 5 whole days with 3 headsets alternating between these issues each. The following we went through, you can easily find these reports from customers on reddit, google, youtube.This is the hell we kept growing through:• Black Screen• Loss of Tracking• Retracing the grid at least 3-5 times a day (in regular lighting)• chunky black borders jumping into your visual from the edges of the screen. Feels like your vision is boxed in.• Every time you reboot pc, microsoft upgrade or if Oculus has an update, you have to remove the wires from the pc and re insert them. This is tedious and annoying.I don’t think Oculus fully tested this device and rushed it to market.I got a refund from amazon and have decided to look into the pimax or index.The Rift S headset is very bad - steer clear unless you love dealing with issues that keep reappearing and oculus is not providing true support for.I would highly advice - stay away.

Final Update: It’s been a few days since my last review and I’m ready to give my final verdict on this product. It’s a good headset, it eventually got itself together and works fine (for now).I’m still getting flashes but not as common, and the stuttering has mostly disappeared. That was one of my biggest immersion-breaking gripes for this headset.I’ve been approaching top 1k in beatsaber and I must say this headset is not for pros. Not often, but once every couple hours one of my sabers will lose tracking for a second and go to 3DOF or appear somewhere else. In rare cases it’ll disappear entirely. This is something that I’ll have to come to accept as I can’t do much about it — unless maybe I somehow messed up my controllers or Oculus needs to have an option for higher refresh rate tracking.All in all, I’m glad with my purchase overall. It’s given me more issues than what I wanted from a $400 item but I’d rather pick this over a 4-year-old Vive.UPDATE (Old): This headset is an absolute mess. So many software and hardware issues to even count. Usually it won’t boot up normally and I’ll have to spend a few hours every time I want to play a game just fixing the software to detect the headset.Examples include:-Being stuck in an endless loop of “Your Oculus software needs to be restarted.” or “No DisplayPort connection.”-Flashing white static every few minutes.-Terribly unreliable tracking that keeps changing with updates.At this point in time, my PC won’t even detect that the headset is plugged in. It’s not possible to restart the software. If this keeps up for the next week or so I’m selling this and buying a Vive. I don’t care if the controllers aren’t as good, I want something that’ll work when I turn it on and want to play a game.Old Review from Day 1:I didn’t expect so much quality from a price tag of only $400. The screens look extremely crisp and the tracking is decent. Extremely easy setup as well, couldn’t believe I was ready to jump in once I plugged it in and updated it.For those who are having problems (not knowing it only runs Windows 10, display ports, etc.) should have checked the headset first before placing a review. The headset itself functions fantastically and does exactly what it’s marketed to and more.I will say though that every time I close Oculus Home and open it back up, I have to take out and plug the display port back in to get the screen to turn in. I’ll probably buy an extension cable so I’m not destroying the port in my graphics card by taking it in and out. Other than that I’m extremely happy with my first PCVR headset. Couldn’t recommend it more for this price point.Attached is a photo of my friend playing Beat Saber.

GENERIC INFORMATIONI'm relatively new to VR and I thought this was a good first introduction to the whole VR community. I tried playing on my friend's VR and had a wonderful experience, albeit a little nauseous. I decided to buy the Oculus rift S so I could spend some time with my friends in VR...and this is where all the negative comes in.FIXES I'VE TRIEDand before we get started, yes it's plugged in. and yes, I've tried turning it off and on again. MY drivers are all updated and my PC specs meet the requirements for VR gaming. I have tried rebooting the Oculus app, unplugging the display port from the headset itself, restarted my PC and followed the plug USB 3.0, and then wait 5 seconds before plugging in the display port (which is one of the ""Fixes"" the oculus rift support suggest) I bought a powered USB 3.0 hub since I thought it was a power issue, nope. The light turns orange, then white, then it just disconnects. It's not a power issue. I borrowed a friend's 3.0 PCI and that didn't work. I unplugged all other accessories, excluding the mouse and keyboard and that didn't work. I unchecked the ""USB selective suspend setting"" I unchecked ""Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power"" for each USB hub I have. I have uninstalled the oculus app and reinstalled several times (This takes a LOT longer than it should have) I don't have SLI and my display port is connected directly to the graphics card. I don't have multiple monitors. USB power issues I've already addressed previously. I tried, painstakingly, every since USB port I had and restarted my pc several times. Eventually, I gave up since I tried everything Youtube would present me and what the Oculus support would advise me.CONCLUSIONMaybe it's just the cable? maybe it's this or maybe it's that. I don't care enough to try and fix it anymore since I've tried for several days now. Haven't even had a chance to play any of the games even though I had bought several in hopes that the VR would work. I don't care enough to have spent so many hours trying to fix a defective product. I'm done with it. I won't ever buy anything from oculus ever again, I might as well spend that cash on an HTC Vive.THOUGHTS?I think this is a great deal for 400$...if it works.

FIRST, to all the reviews complaining about the lack of HDMI...Place that blame on the manufacturers that labeled their laptops ""oculus ready"" and on yourself for not doing research on a rather expensive product.  That's not a fault of the headset.THAT BEING SAID, to the review:I've waited around a month before writing a review on this product, so that I could properly test, familiarize, and understand the ""day to day"" use of this product.  I did encounter some issues when I first used the Rift S.  Primarily those issues were static flickering (on rare occasions) and tracking issues with the controllers in normal gaming situations, such as shooting a bow and arrow, holding a rifle with both hands, etc.  These issues have all but been handled by Oculus's development team, who have been spitting out improvements by the week.For reference: My pc specs: i7 6600k, RTX 2080, 16GB Ram  My play space is around 7 x 8 feet.Hardware:For 400 dollars you get the Rift S and 2 motion controllers.  This hardware connects via a single USB 3.0 and Display Port.  I have 3 screens (1440p 144hz, 1080p 60hz, and a 4k TV that I have running at 30hz).  Having this rather demanding setup hasn't presented any issues that I've seen in other VR headsets...which could be attested to windows updates or Oculus's superior drivers.  DESPITE the specs, the screen looks gorgeous in VR.  I have no issues with ""screen door"" effect, lens flare effects (doesn't look like JJ Abrams Star Trek), or issues with light bleeding in from being in a bright environment.  The headset feels comfortable to wear, even with long hair (and in a pony tail).  Padding is comfortable to wear as well...but there still is an issue with it being warm after rigorous playing, such as beat saber...and as gross as it is, the face padding does soak up sweat.Many complain about the lack of IPD adjustment....and I was worried about that myself (I'm at 59mm) but I can say it's a non issue for me.  The sweet spot is a bit smaller vs adjustable ipd headsets but it still works fine, and things look clear as day in VR.The screen has great color reproduction and the lower refresh rate compared to the first generation oculus has not been noticeable.  Resolution is great for most situations...though in some games when looking at a great distance, things can look a bit blurry far away.  Field of view feels like you're wearing a scuba mask, but doesn't hurt the experience, in my opinion.Sound...yes the reviews are true. Sound isn't great.  There is a 3.5 jack on the headset though for wired headphones, however.  Personally the sound isn't bad enough for me to not use, as it helps a lot being able to perceive noise outside of the VR experience.Controllers are excellent. They work great, are comfortable to use, and can take some abuse.  I've had a couple of situations where I was playing Gorn or Echo VR and slammed one into a wall/desk trying to hit someone.  They've received scuff marks but other than that work good as new, despite experiencing my wrath.  There is a guardian system that does a great job letting you know when you get close to something, but I personally get so immersed, my brain will ignore the big lines telling me ""No, step back!"" because I have a blood lust that needs to be satiated by murdering these cartoon gladiators.Cable: Does the job and appears to be rather thick.  It does get tangled from turning in one direction too many times, and can kink from that.  I have a few bad looking kinks from my playing but they don't seem to affect the connection at all. It does have a bit of weight to it, and it can get annoying by getting in the way when playing...I've personally alleviated this by velcro tying the cable to exit the back of the headset, which solved any issue of it getting in the way.Sensors:  What sensors?  They are all built in!Now for software!Tracking:  I realize this is partially hardware but software changes have had major impacts to the tracking.  So far, tracking is fantastic on this headset.  As I stated earlier, there were some issues in situations that have been solved with updates.  The only times I lose tracking now is by putting my hands completely behind my back (blocking the controllers from the cameras).  This isn't of much consequence that I can tell...I never have issues grabbing guns or weapons over the shoulder in games.  The tracking feels akin to having 3 sensors in older VR setups...and this change makes the Rift S the most user friendly VR headset out there (aside from maybe the Quest).  Setting up your VR environment takes less than a minute and the ability to have pass through is a GOD SEND.  No more taking off the headset when you need to move something, etc.  There's a setting that allows you to double tap the oculus home button and voila, you see everything around you.Oculus software:  Works fantastic, there are a load of features, such as desktop view (which you can use to see any/all of your monitors in the VR environment), good interaction with Steam VR games, allowing you to launch straight from Oculus, super easy to use and very intuitive.  There are occassional hangups when exiting Steam VR games...Oculus won't register sometimes that the game has been exited and it can keep you from relaunching until you restart steam/oculus....and in some cases your whole PC.  It's a very minor issue that happens very rarely, but it's there.This review is getting a bit long so let's wrap it up with a ""Should you buy?""Assuming you have adequate PC specs;If you already own a VR headset:DEPENDS.  Every VR headset has it's own pros and cons....if you're looking for something more convenient, this might be a good change for you. Vive and old oculus users...you're probably fine with what you have....there's some improvements and some drawbacks compared to those headsets.  If you're tired of the sensors and 5 USB connections that are needed, this could be a good switch for you.  I personally think the screen is better than the 1st gen Oculus, despite the spec difference.  If you own a VR headset like the Go, off-brand...maybe even windows mixed reality; you'll likely be very happy with this headset in comparison.If you're new to VR:  YES, absolutely yes.  This headset is perfect for the PC gamer who's ready to try out VR.  It's easy to setup and get started, and provides a great VR experience!  400 dollars gets you a AAA VR experience, which compared to some 500-1000 dollar headsets, pretty great deal.I have to say this is the best purchase I've made in years, and I'm still enjoying playing every day...I've even made it part of my workout routine!  Now if we can just get padding replacements, we'll be golden.

So far, this unit is DOA.  I'm not sure if it is a device issue or a software issue, but oculus will not recognize the headset to set it up.  It is available in the device manager both on the USB 3.0 and Oculus Virtual Gamepad Emulator Bus.  I am waiting for Oculus support to get back to me.  All updates are installed for USB, Windows 10, and graphics card.  The light comes on on the head set, but the program just spins.  I hope I can get this fixed before it ruins my son's Christmas as it is about everything he was getting this year.Update.  After doing a bunch of research on this and getting no help from Oculus.  I found a solution.  There is a card you can buy from Best Buy that is supposed to work.  However, I tried to get one next day aired, and they decided the next day to tell me it would be here by 1-17 maybe.  So I started calling computer shops and whatnot.  I ended up getting a VisionTek Products Four Port USB 3.0 x1 PCIe Internal Card for PCs and Servers - 900870 recommended.  I then called the manufacturer and asked if they were Oculus approved, and they said yes.  I ordered it from Amazon, and it came it one day.  I live you, Amazon.  I installed it, and instantly, the USB 3.0 was recognized, and then the display port came right up.  The thing is super awesome, and I cannot wait to give it to my son.  FYIEtron USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller - 1.0 (Microsoft) is no good for this system.  If you have it, it will not work!The Reneasus USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller - 1.0 (Microsoft) DOES WORKYou must check to see what USB 3.0 controller you have.  Be ready on Christmas folks

Bought this thing for my son for Christmas.  Spec's on the computer was a little below specs so had to upgrade the USB and processor which makes it well within spec for this device and still does not work.  contacted the company for support (no number available) via e-mail.  The suggestions to fix were everything you can find online to try already.  After troubleshooting they sent a replacement device which also did not work.  contacted again and they sent the same instruction to fix it again.  I requested a refund or exchange wich they denied me and said I would have to go through where I purchased it.....I bought the stupid thing months ago.  I work in next support and know my way around a computer but this thing is another level of difficult and would not recommend to anyone who is not guru level with computer hardware or maybe you will get lucky at it work out of the box.

I was excited about my Rift S headset, but it arrived with a defective controller that had a ""low battery"" error that caused it to shut off, despite replacing the batteries and swapping them between controllers. A very obvious defect on a brand new product.Oculus took a week to tentatively confirm something might be wrong with my controller, and then in order to replace it, I have to ship my controller back to them FIRST before they will start the process to ship me a replacement.Going to be 2 weeks after spending $400 that I might be able to use my headset. If everything works like it should.The hardware is impressive, but I don't even get to use it, and their customer RMA experience is absolute trash for such a fringe enthusiast product. Any time I use my headset in the future, there will be an asterisk on the side that says ""doesn't understand customer experience"" in regards to Oculus. I would not buy this again based on the first 2 weeks of ownership.

I created a facebook account to play my new oculus rift s, bought a bunch of games on the oculus app, then the facebook AI deletes my facebook account and now I can't access my games that I purchased.  All I had on my facebook account was my name and a bio that said ""I only made this facebook account to play on my oculus, I don't want to share my private info"".  The oculus and facebook user support is a joke.  It has been 2 days since I issued a ticket on the oculus website and still no response, I'm going to dispute the purchases with my credit card company for the games I bought, rebuy them on steamvr and use steam vr to play my games.  Don't buy this item and especially don't buy games on the oculus app.

The Packaging and Arrival time was spot on. The seller not only packaged everything in the Original Box but the items arrived a few days sooner than expected. I have two Video Editing System I was hoping my computers could use the Oculus Rift S on my PC, but sadly it didn't. One because my Older System has to still use Window 7 because of the Software program to create DVD's & Blu-Rays... (Adobe Encore) which Adobe, Windows and Oculus Rift no longer supports Windows 7. Then I tried my Windows 10, but the Video card is for processing Video Editing and the only Game I play on both systems is Aces High III which sadly can handle a Monitor but I found out just shy of being able to use the Oculus during game play. I highly Recommend this seller because all the descriptions and quality placed in packaging and returns was just absolutely Amazing. Two Thumbs and Highly Recommend this Seller.

I purchased this to use with Xplane, the flight sim. My system is an i7-7900k, 24GB RAM, and an EVGA 1080ti hybrid GPU. I had just taken up flying in real life and I wanted an immersive experience at home.First, the Oculus Rift S is VERY COOL. The demo is nothing short of amazing. But that's kind of all there was to it that seemed worthwhile. Xplane was awfully rendered, and I didn't want to spend more money on other games that didn't seem appealing, since I got the Oculus for Xplane, not random brief VR games.Problems started immediately on unboxing:1) The foam that touches your face smells HORRIBLE. It made me nauseous, and took weeks to dissipate to a level that was bearable. My wife noticed it too.2) Once I installed the Oculus application, it gave me an error on launch that I needed a specific Nvidia driver that was several versions behind the one I had installed. I thought that was weird, but uninstalled my current driver and installed the one they specified. WHOOPS. Now the Oculus application said my driver was out of date and to update it! So I uninstalled that driver and reinstalled the original, most recent one. Now it worked.3) Every 30-40 seconds there was a light ""click"" sound in the headset speakers. I never did figure out what it was.4) The ""dashboard"" for the Oculus would sometimes come up in awkward places relative to me, like 4 feet above my head, over my shoulder, etc. Sometimes an extra one would appear, interfering with the current one.5) So, getting to Xplane, I was used to flying with pretty high rendering settings with 3 or 4 monitors. With those settings, Xplane was soooo stuttery and barely 15 FPS. So I started reading about all of the issues with Xplane and Oculus. This involved hours and hours over weeks of testing settings, installing various tools like 3jfps, messing around with settings, etc. Ultimately on near the lowest of rendering settings I could get 30 fps in Xplane but it looked awful and even 30fps can get you a little motion sick pretty easily.Ultimately I returned it because what I wanted to do was fly planes in VR, not mess around endlessly with settings.

The BIGGEST problem of all is the manufacturing quality of the controllers. I accidentally hit myself in the face while playing Beat Saber and caused the split in the tracking ring. A quick google search shows that this is a common problem and it's obvious why. The tracking ring is under constant tension and over time, this WILL cause a failure in all controllers built with this tension. This is obvious due to how the controller looks after the break. If the ring were not under tension, the ring would stay together. However, this is not the case and there is an obvious gap which proves this. Additionally, it is almost impossible to push the 2 halves together further proving how much tension the tracking ring really was on.Funny enough, it almost appears as if it were designed to break in this specific location. All the IR leds on the tracking ring are fully functional and there is no change in usability.I contacted Oculus warranty support and it seems they are aware of the issue and are willing to issue replacements once they receive the defective unit. WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU is that there is no stock (most likely due to how common of an issue this is) and they can not send a replacement controller. They also refuse to send your original one back. I have now been without a controller for a month making my $350 purchase (as of Black Friday 2019) useless as I only have one left controller.Also... I upgraded from the Rift to the Rift S because I found the IR cameras to be very cumbersome to setup. This setup was more or less plug and play. While the Rift S is a good value, it does have a lot to be desired. Tracking when the controllers are temporarily outside the view of the cameras gets lost for a split second. Enough to cause missed notes in beat saber.These new controllers are a shame compared to the near indestructible original Rift controllers where I punched a wall and won (it took paint off the wall).

If you're new to VR, this is well worth the money. I've had a blast!BUT take your time! Don't jump face first into fast paced shoot 'em up games with a lot walking around and movement. I was sick to my stomach for 24 hours and was contemplating returning it. But I forced myself through once I felt better and have slowly been getting my ""VR feet"".I was still getting small amounts of motion sickness here and there for a week or so, but it slowly stopped effecting me as much. Just take your time, and pace yourself. I still limit myself to 45-60 minutes of play just to make sure. If I feel sick, I don't continue until the next day.Also, playing stand-in-place games helps a lot to overcome motion sickness. I'd start with those first if you're feeling woozy.

PLEASE HEED THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS.In order to use this system on your PC, your PC MUST have a display port (many computers do not have this!)Although you can buy converter cables, they do not work. Most cables are unidirectional in the wrong direction. Moreover, your PC will search for hours to find ""compatable drivers"", which apparently do not exist.In addition - which is the REAL problem - customer support is non-existent. I submitted a ticket and got a list of ""here try this..."". There is no one anywhere to actually speak with.Facebook bought Oculus a couple years back, and they are driving Oculus into the ground.Incredibly disappointed.

I'm on the fence when it comes to whether or not to return this. I bought a CV1 which I sold and used the money to buy this. The audio is worse. The ventilation is non-existant. The controllers are so much worse. The only improvement is the screen and I guess not having the sensors is nice but I never needed them. Passthrough is nice when it's needed but.. it doesn't make up for all of the shortcomings of this headset.As someone really into VR it pains me to say this but I'm feeling pretty burnt out. I think I might just have to wait until VR gets better and more popular before I jump back onboard. And wireless. The S also hurts my neck and gives me eye strain when the CV1 didn't. I have to adjust this CONSTANTLY whereas the CV1 was a one and done experience.The screen is much better, though. Night and day difference. Love seeing games like it's the first time I've ever seen them. Huge step up there. Going from 3 sensor tracking to this inside out tracking is bad, though. Not game-endingly awful but constant annoyance, slightly behind real life, and inaccurate enough at times to take you out of the experience.I think I prefer this over the CV1 but to be honest the CV1 was better in too many ways and has spoiled this experience. I'm going to keep trying for the sake of not being VR-less for the next 2 - 3 years but this product isn't the right one for me. Valve Index is too expensive and still isn't quite ""VR 2.0"". I don't foresee a VR 2.0 headset launching before 2021. This is very bittersweet for me.

Disappointed with the lower quality featuresPros:Clear vibrant image compared to original Rift, comfort is good, setup very quick and easy, tracking works OK.Cons:Speakers suck they sound worse then a cell phone, cord is thicker and heavy, Poor Mic quality sound, new touch controllers only vibrate half as much as the old ones did, IPD adjustments I did not even notice a change when adjusting like you would with the slide type on the original Rift , got eye strain and headaches after 30min but with the old Rift I could adjust it and play for hours with no problem.I really had high hopes for the Rift s and waited a long time for the release will more than likely return it and wait for sometime better to come out.

I started with the Rift, then the Go, then the Quest. All have their own types of problems. I bought the Rift S because I thought Oculus would have worked through most of the bugs and glitches by now. Wrong. I've had far more trouble just getting the Rift S to work than all my other headsets COMBINED. Here's a partial list, all of which took hours to work through, each.Firmware update failedChecking sensors failedDisplayport failedNo sound, then sound, then horrible sound, then on again-off again soundThe Rift S is still not working properly for me. I can vouch for the notion that once again Oculus released a product without proper testing -- sort of reminds us all of GoPro, eh? I am the world's most fervent believer in and promotor of VR, but honestly, this is ridiculous. Every time I decide I want to strap on and play a game, that excitement is almost totally muted because I know....I KNOW that it will be one failure after another and instead of playing a fun game I'll end up trying to trouble-shoot the bugs and glitches for five hours, reading endlessly on the web about other peoples' apoplexy and returns, and wondering, myself, why I don't return it. On the good side, I like the screens -- pleasing to the eye, at least to me. I find the mask by FAR the most comfortable of all the VR headsets. But the sound, even when working, is just atrocious. Each iteration of Oculus has produced more and more worthless sound. The complaints about sound are legion. You'd think the Oculus hardware engineers would at some point finally GET IT? Nope. I like having only one wire and no trackers, but the one wire isn't even remotely long enough, just like the Rift. Why? Everybody who ever bought the original Rift complained long and loudly about the absurdly short wire, and everyone has struggled through countless purchases of extension cords that don't work. Doe Oculus have stock in USB cable makers, and that's how they plan to REALLY make their money? Almost all of the games I've tried on the S have crashed mid-game. I have about sixty games (yes, I'm hardcore into VR). I only have two days in this new headset, and already it has been significantly more maddening than all the others put together. The Quest was the best, but the very limited horsepower of it makes it only a party gadget. I had this one shipped to me to SE Asia, and so returning will make me lose about $150, even if I get a full refund, so I'll keep struggling and keep swearing and keep hoping Oculus someday gets its head out of it A--- and starts making a consumer-ready product.UPDATE: I originally rated this at two stars. Now upgrading to three. It APPEARS.....knock on wood, that it's running properly now, but I lost many hours and a couple of days in working through the plethora of bugs. Had it not been for that, this would be a solid four stars. I still have trouble with certain games that ran flawlessly through the Rift. If all games and apps ran properly, this would be scoring at a solid and honest five stars. This all tells me that Oculus MUST forget about PC or computer-based headsets, and figure out how to give us the same speed and reliability, in an untethered headset like the Quest. All this BS with the tethered headsets is killing off customers, and you know, you KNOW that nothing, NOTHING that depends on ANY Microsoft product will EVER run smoothly or reliably. We've been waiting since Windows 95. Reliability from MS is NOT going to happen. Ever. I promise. I sure hope I start getting some fun out of the ""S"" now, but everytime MS updates something, it tends to be one step forward and three steps backward. Oculus does a poor job of allowing for Microsoft's incompetence.

This is a great entry-level VR headset for the PC that won't break the bank, but it has some caveats that need to be researched before purchasing.I would say the biggest thing you need to consider before buying is if your IPD (interpupillary distance) is within the range of 61.5 and 65.5mm. This device does NOT have a physical IPD adjuster; the lenses are locked at 63.5mm. The ""software IPD adjustment"" is just for scale and does not replace a physical adjuster. My IPD happens to be 64mm so the device works great for me, but if you have an IPD much higher or lower than the ideal range, it may not ever be in focus.If your IPD is higher or lower than 61.5 and 65.5mm, I recommend looking towards another device. The Oculus Quest is an option, as it has a physical IPD adjuster, but the ""Oculus Link"" (the ability to tether to a PC like the Rift S) is currently a beta as of 1/6/2020 and even if it worked flawlessly there are still some tradeoffs with the Rift S where I personally believe the Rift S is still the better option (mainly due to halo headstrap design and lighter weight).Also as of 1/6/2020, the software often fails to recognize the device and requires a lot of unplugging and plugging and restarting Oculus software etc., but once it gets running everything is fine.Conclusion: if you intend to play VR PC games, and your IPD is between 61.5 and 65.5mm, this is a great start for the money!

So I got the new Rift S to get a replacement for my original Rift as there is some light bleed on the right side of the of the lens but on to the review......The package is very nice come with headset with USB 3.0 and a display port attached, 2 controllers with 2 double 2 battery and the controllers require 1 each. So no more senors around your room trying to figure out what's the best place to where your not tripping over cords as the headset come with 5 senors on the head set which is a plus for me. On to my Pros and ConsPros:1. Set up was very easy.they show a video step by step and what needs to be done.2. I love the fact now you can actually look at your surrounds without taking the headset off when you set out of boundaries. And you don't need to set up the height as during set up you lightly tap the floor and now it knows how far it is to the floor which is great if you like playing shooters and you trying to pick up your weapon without touching the floor.3.Headset is very comfortable and more secure then the previous headset4.the display inside the headset is more crisp since it has a LCD display instead of a OLED display in my option.5. The controllers have a more grippy texture to them instead of all plastic like the previous gen.6. You can play with glass on which is a huge plus for me. There is and adjustment on the head set to pull the lens close or far to where you need it.Cons:1. Its great not to have senors BUT the tracking is a little off. Like for instance I played robot recall (great game if you don't have it get it) I'm try to throw the weapon back at the robot and it does not want to let go of the gun and it just drop to the floor I have to throw like slow motion to get my tracking just right. Wish you can use at least 1 senor for things like this since you cant use the 1st gen senors. Hope that changes soon.2. I have a big head it just barely fits over my glasses and my head. But it makes up for it with the comfort.3.the controllers are a little bit smaller then the original rift controller as you can see on the image. It does not give you any finger room. I have normal size hands but for people with big hand this might be a negative.4. The Rift S crashed a couple of times for no apparent reason which is odd as my set up is a Ryzen 2700x with16gb of ram and my GPU is rx590 sapphire edition it might just be since the system just came out today might need a update to get things fixed5. I just wished they added a headset attached to the system like the original. Like I said my head barely fits and my artic 5 just fits over the headset and the down side to it is now I got a cord running down a loop and from time to time I get tangled from my arm going through the loop of the cord of my headphones.Grade: 3.9 / 5Overall the headset is great buy if your first time in vr and don't want to break the bank and you have a small room or your old rift is breaking since they don't make the original any more. BUT if your looking for an upgrade I would wait until they get all the kinks out and update the tracking or at least you can use the original senors for better tracking performance. Will update once it gets better

If you have a powerful gaming laptop that can run VR games with a display port, then this is for you. This headset makes it so you don't have to lug around external sensors for your VR experience.If you don't own a VR headset and are new to this experience, then this too is for you. Not a bad start for getting into VR.But if your already a well seasoned VR player and already own the Oculus Rift (CV1) and prefer a very good tracking system, over slightly better graphics, then this isn't for you.  The upgrade in graphics is nice and noticeable , not by a lot , but noticeable for sure from the the CV1 model. But you lose complete tracking abilities that the CV1 offers with its 3 external sensor setup. You also lose a good set of built in headphones that came with the original model . It's annoying to me to have to worry about headphones now every time I put on the Rift S. You also go from 90Hz down to 80Hz , which is noticeable to me when playing fast action games like Space Pirate Trainer just to name one.The 2 main drawbacks to me for the Oculus Rift S are what I listed above, the tracking system that has blind spots in it's design , and the audio , where you now have to worry about headphones .  The Oculus Rift S is more like a step sideways than a step forward in terms of innovation. It's not an upgrade to the original Rift CV1 , but it's another option for people not looking for the best tracking and for people who don't want to deal with external sensors , people who prefer a more portable , all in one easy to set up package.All in all it's a good option for anyone looking to get into VR and I would still recommend it , but wouldn't recommend it to everyone , like I said above.

I bought this headset to experience vr, and the reason i choose this one was because of all the good reviews it had received. I played Half-Life: Alyx, Skyrim VR, Fallout 4 VR, Saints & Sinners, Alien Isolation VR, and a few other minor titles. Overall the headset it pretty good. I wish I could adjust the eye distance thing, but by raising or lower headset I was able to get it just right. I'm not sure if this is a Rift S specific issue, but this thing eats controller batteries like they're Snicker bars. Also the cable is super annoying. I don't know what the future of VR looks like, but I can almost guarantee it's wireless.

I'm not at all impressed with the Rift S.  I had a Samsung Odyssey Mixed Reality Headset and it was much better than the Rift S until it died on me, but the Rift S hasn't worked well from Day 1.Pros  - None I can think ofCons -  The Rift S has a very cheap and thin foam cushion, which will cause strain on your face and make marks/impression.  I had to purchase a 3rd party add-on to fix that, at extra cost.The Rift S allows light to leak in around the nose area...much worse than the Samsung Odyssey Mixed Reality headset, even though people give that one bad marks for light leakage, when in fact the Rift S is much worse.  My prior headset, the Odyssey didn't have much light leakage and all, and had a much softer inner liner so was much more comfortable to wear.The Rift S keeps trying to make you set up the Guardian boundary system, whether you have already set it up previously or don't want to use it, etc.  There is no way to turn it off.  It will interrupt you to do that, while you're trying to play a game, like iracing, which is simply a no-go for anyone serious about racing.  If they can't give a person the ability to turn it off, it's not a good headset, is not well engineered, etc.- The Rift S will stop tracking on you, a lot, and you will spend a lot of time unplugging it, re-plugging it, re-starting the software, etc etc.  It does not want to work properly, right away, no matter what.  I have a gaming computer built for VR, yet it never seems to work properly at all.- The controllers are not as good as other brands...and, mine don't even work properly...the  headset can't tell where your hands are...they are pictured stationary, instead of moving, etc.  Basically, mine is either defective or the headset is just a pile of junk to begin with.I'd steer clear of this one unless you like wasting money.  I could really use a refund, as I paid for this crap, tried to make it work, warranty period is probably expired now, and it's un-usable.I would not recommend this headset at all.  I would get a Windows Mixed Reality or some other type.

 The cameras sensor on the left side of my Rift S are defective. My left controller constantly freezes, disappears, or teleports randomly into nowhere. I've been on an email thread with Oculus support for literally 2 months and it has just been hoops of ""trouble shooting"" and ""can you confirm your S/Ns"" and ""can you get some logs"". Pretty much any game except for one-handed ones are completely unplayable.Go buy a Valve Index instead. If you're worried about Oculus store exclusives--they are all garbage. Steam has all of the same good games, and they don't lock you into the Oculus hardware ecosystem.

This product, while cool when it kind of worked (which was rare) is not nearly ready for prime time.  The stringent requirements on hardware, which we met, alongside the twitchiest software (software for the Oculus itself, along with the firmware, along with ever changing requirements for video card and Windows 10 drivers, made this a nightmare to try and manage.Customer service itself was decent and responsive, but just couldn't make up for what feels like a product still in beta. I work in the IT industry, and have so for 20 years now, and this product doesn't feel like it should have been released.We fought with this for about a week with my frustrated son, and finally gave up and returned it in defeat (thank you Amazon!).  If you have the money to burn and don't mind countless interactions with support along with scouring the internet for half fixes on multiple forums, then this might be for you.  If you want something that works first time out of the box, probably best to look elsewhere.  I'm happy there are folks that found success, we weren't in that group unfortunately.

I thought that buying the Rift S would simplify my play area setup and experience, but got exactly the opposite compared to the original Rift. For whatever reason, the setup process refuses to properly setup my display area. With the original rift, the setup would be relative to the sensors -- But since the Rift S does not use external sensors, it is having a much harder time figuring out my play area. As a result, games tend to think my play area is inside of my desk, and there doesn't seem to be any way to easily reset this in all games. Some games, like Beat Sabre offer a way to adjust the room settings to compensate, but that's not the case for all games, where you're at the mercy of the Oculus software.Pick up the original set with sensors instead. I am going to give away the Rift S and stick with the original

DesignI like it, find it's elegant enough, presentable. Very nice unboxing experience, feels premium and most importantly is very comfortable. The fact that it uses inside out tracking is excellent. You don't need towers, tracking is on point and has no problem keeping up with super fast movement in games (for example beat saber on expert +). The cable is long enough and not too thick.The display easily accommodates glasses when used correctly (pushing the button to pull forward, opening the halo and placing from the front before tightening the halo) so my friend who wears glasses can use it no problems.NOTE the controllers use AA batteries, their life is not so great so I highly recommend getting rechargeable batteries. also the rumble is not that strong, but I got used to it (when compared to move controllers). Finally, the ring that faces backwards can be a problem as you forget they're there you can hit your head mounted display, hit the other controller (for example when reloading a gun in vr) etc. But they seem to be strong (as I have had some accidents XDAUDIOOn board speakers are very bad, highly recommend you use headphones, that's what I do and the experience is great. Audio out of the headset is amplified on board and sounds wonderful with good over-ear headphones, just make sure yours can go around the halo as it is quite thick.VisualsComing from psvr, I was amazed at the graphics fidelity. Resolution is great, refresh rate is excellent, I don't feel a problem with blacks as some say. Overall its amazing and will obviously depend on the game and your PC. But the headset is capable of some really good quality stuff (try something like asgards wrath, skyrim in VR or project cars 2 and you'll see what I mean).USABILITYNow this will probably depend on the user. Im running ryzen 5 3600, rtx 2060 super.PLEASE make sure your graphics card has a display port (or miniDP) available and that your PC has a USB port available for it, you need both to make it work.I feel that following the oculus setup was easy enough, I installed it on my main drive (an NVME m.2) for fast startup as it starts automatically when you connect the headset. Once set up you plug and play.Just insert the headset, and in the headset itself you can do everything, from exploring your customizable VR home, choosing or buying games, or controlling your computer with a built in virtual desktop (useful for starting steam games not detected in your oculus library right from the headset).The fact that you can double press the oculus button to see the outside world is very useful. Guardian can save you from breaking your fingers against a wall.All in all, I've had a great experience.Couple of things that weren't great: first time I played the demo, no audio in the tutorial, seems to be related to a windows update? It got fixed suddenly the next day.Second thing, sometimes when i load up theres color static on the picture, I think it's related to how the DP is connected, I just move it a bit and it gets fixed, it's not constant, just a nuisance at the beginning every now and then.So that's what I can say so far. I'm new on PC VR, and Ive played quite a bit of pavlov, project cars 2, skyrim vr and beat saber (mostly these) and I can say it's wonderful and I'm loving it so far. More than worth the price.I highly recommend this to anyone considering VR.*Make sure you have a DP and a good USB port available

I absolutely love this product. I was worried about the cables and the performance but my gosh what a beast. The gameplay is amazing. I can see this being mainstream in a tmyeat or two once the display link wireless adapter drops. Well worth the money for a rope end quality performance VR system that's PC powered so its upgradable. So satisfied I will be looking for the cybershoes or s ok me sort of ODT to get the full walking experience. Unit has a solid quality feel. It's not junkie it's well balanced and the motion joysticks are beautifully designed. We are super impressed!

I really enjoyed this VR headset, but unfortunately my gaming laptop met the bare minimum specs and it was taking a toll on my eyes.  After trying it out for a couple weeks, it got to the point that my eye fatigue just became too much.  Even with the pupil distance set properly.  I'll have to pick it up again once I get around to building my desktop.My only other complaint was that I had to set the distance I was sitting at, often.  Which became annoying after a bit.  It'd be centered correctly, then I'd go into 'FSS' mode which is a virtual system scanning mode in the game, then when I backed out, it would reposition where center was putting my view behind my Commander's body (with a clear view of the neck hole) and the back of the chair clipping over my view on the edges.Not sure what that was about, but it's possible it was because my laptop just wasn't handling VR well.  I also would get white, static flashes which would really hurt my eyes.  Again, I think it was in part due to the laptop just not being powerful enough.Still, it was an amazing experience.  Once I have a better computer, I plan to get another one.  Just might be a while.

VR headsets have been prohibitively expensive since their inception.  In addition, they required setup of boxes positioned throughout a room in order to track, which is another barrier to entry for some people.  I was affected by both of these issues.The Rift S was a solution to all of this.Unfortunately, all other aspects aside, the fixed IPD makes the Rift S completely unusable.I was ignorant to IPD.  Nothing on Oculus' Rift S product page even mentions IPD.  Nothing on or in the box mentioned IPD.  It was only until after I attempted to use the HMD did I run into what IPD is and how EXTREMELY important it is for HMDs.My IPD is 75mm.  I also suffer from high astigmatism.  The Rift S is unusable without contacts in (not unexpected), and I can only get one eye in focus while the other is 100% blurred.  Everything outside the very center of my view is very blurry.The first time I came out of VR I suffered from heavily distorted vision in one eye and got nauseatingly sick which took hours to recover from.  I have no doubt attempting to use the Rift S is damaging my eyes in some way.Oculus' attempts to cut costs have significantly harmed this device.. which is a replacement for the Rift which they no longer manufacture.  It is completely unacceptable.The only other options as far as I'm aware are the Oculus Quest or Vive Cosmos.  The former functions nothing like the Rift/S (Link doesn't fix the technical design), the latter is a completely separate (and inferior) ecosystem and $300 more expensive.  I don't want to even try either of these based on reviews I've seen.So, finally after all this time waiting, I'm back to waiting, until either a Rift S+, or the other higher end HMDs come down in price (Valve Index for a mandatory $1,000 is a sick joke).I'm extremely upset.If you're not within 2-3mm of the Rift S's fixed 64mm IPD, avoid it like the plague, and send some harsh feedback to Oculus about their horrific decision to have a fixed IPD.

The Bad:1. When first plugging in the Rift S and using the Oculus software to set it up I got stuck on the section that said ""Continue setup in VR"" as the setup would never pull up in VR. When I put on the headset it would display a loading screen of three white dots flashing from left to right.. Simply closing and restarting the Oculus program fixed this issue.2. I can't attest to this issue as I saw people having it and prematurely fixed it but if your USB port/Hub that you use for the Rift S has the power saving feature of turning off when idle it can cause issue with the Rift S. It's not a hard fix and could likely be mentioned in the setup process (or even fixed) at some point in the future but still worth mentioning.3. There are a few tracking issues for the controllers. If you move your hand behind your back you will lose tracking after ~3 seconds or so. In addition, touching the front of your body and keeping them there does seem to make it lose tracking after a similar amount of time. In either case simply moving hte controllers back into view of the tracking system results in tracking being restored.4. The sound system is sufficient but if you're an audiophile or going to play anything where bass is important you're going to want a headset or another alternative. I personally use the sound system I used for my computer before owning this with no issue.The Good:1. No god rays2. SDE is greatly reduced.3. The resolution bump is nice making text very readable4. Once I did overcome the initial setup hurdle mentioned earlier I had no further complications and everything just worked.5. The strap is pretty comfortable although for more active games you do have to tighten it to the point where the headset is pretty noticeable for the first few minutes to securely attach it in place.6. Tracking on the controllers seems to be very accurate.7. Guardian system is very easy to set up and has already helped me with not running into walls and other objects.8. The ability to enable double tapping a button on the controller to enable pass through is nice as if someone walks in the room I can pause and then see them while having a conversation without taking off the headset.All in all the headset is pretty good and I have enjoyed my purchase. Don't be dissuaded by the one star reviews saying it doesn't support Windows 7 or needs a display port and they didn't know. You're told that you need a display port as well as Windows 10 above on this page.

When reading and watching professional reviews on the Oculus Rift S, the phrase ""significantly reduced screen door effect"" was thrown around quite a bit. It was one of the factors that motivated me to pull the trigger on this headset. After spending a few days with it, I just don't think it's ""significantly reduced"" enough. For casual games it's perfectly acceptable, but for more visually appealing games that have a non-VR variant, I feel like it's not worth strapping on the headset. Even racing games lack the immersion and realism that I would expect from VR because of the degradation in image quality.The other issue I have is the refresh rate. Going from a 144Hz monitor to 80Hz headset is a bit of a let-down. I kinda knew what I was getting into, but I wasn't willing to drop a grand on the Valve Index, so I won't really hold the refresh rate against the Rift S. Still it does detract from the experience.The headset itself is relatively comfortable and light. Adjusting it, and getting it on and off are fairly easy as well, although I find myself re-positioning it often when the focus area gets out of line from movement and sweat. It's a bit frustrating because for me, I get the best focus when the lenses are slightly further from my eyes than the headset is designed to extend. All I need is an extra few mm. I also wish the area where you can see crisp text etc. were a bit wider. I'm sure there's science stuff involved that explains why you to only have a small area of the lens able to focus on a clear image, but it doesn't stop me from getting annoyed.Setting up my play area was a piece of cake, and the pass-through video is pretty cool (though would prefer the image to be a bit higher quality). However, when switching from a standing to a seated game, you have to turn off the Guardian play area, and when you turn it back on, you have to rescan your area. Not sure why it doesn't save it.Tracking of the controllers is really impressive for inside out tracking. Only once have I lost a controller playing beat saber when my hand was behind my back before I swung it forward. The controllers themselves are ok. I'm still not used to picking them up and recognizing which hand is which or what direction they're supposed to be facing. Not sure how that could be improved. I'm thinking of picking up some aftermarket grips that allow you to secure them to your hands like the Valve Knuckles.I am underwhelmed by the Oculus living room or whatever they call the area that you launch apps from. The interface is finicky, it's not very intuitive, and there are some screens or modes I just don't know how to get out of. The avatar creation tool, while cool, is pretty limited as far as customization goes. I'm incredibly disappointed that you can't share your game library with other members of your family, so it hardly pays to purchase games from the Oculus store. Instead I'll have to buy them on Steam, and use Steam VR on top of Oculus VR to play them. I have a beast of a computer so I don't notice a performance hit, but for others it may be an issue.Lastly, I have to talk about the physical side effects of using the Oculus Rift. I'm not sure if they're unique to this particular headset or just my reaction to VR overall. I get pretty damn ill after using it for some titles. Some worse than others. I played Minecraft for literally 1 minute before I almost passed out. Project Cars was only good for two races before the sweats and nausea got to me. I read that adjusting the lens IPD settings could help, but I haven't figured out a good setting. There's no calibrating tool that goes along with adjusting the settings either, so it's hard to know what you're even looking for. After using the headset for just a few minutes at a time, I have a very hard time readjusting my vision to the real world. Sometimes I'll have vision impairment for a few hours, with headaches and nausea usually coming along for the ride. I'm still testing to see if I can somehow reduce the effects.Overall I'm ok with the Rift S. Not impressed, not wowed, not completely satisfied. Still it's a pretty solid piece of hardware and it works as advertised. For the price, I can't imagine you can get a better experience. Especially without the hassle of setting up external trackers. I'm pretty stoked to see what the future holds for this technology, but right now, it's just ok.

It is sad that using causally, and the unit started to malfunction, only had it for a few weeks. Not sure exactly if it was the cable, I could not see any major pinched areas, only very small indent in the cable, I tried to move around in that area to see if it would stop or get worse and it as not the problem.  (unit was returned)Why I believe it could be hardware related:  starting up the unit while PC has been off for a while and unit is cold, only the static pixels would be present, after a few min the screen would start to flash black on and off, and parts of it.  Then no display for periods of time, but you can hear the audio still, if taking it on off gets the unit to start showing display.Tried it on, laptop with display port, same exact issue, both systems are very capable, and tried different drivers and even the beta oculus rift s along with the firmwares etc...  Tried to reseat the cable no luck.Both laptop and desktop have professional quadro rtx 3000 and 4000.Wasted a lot of time on something that I causally would use, mostly tried to use the set for 3D model rendering stuff, to see how the apps would work with it, when the rift s worked it as nice.The headset is quite comfortable, but the issues that I had and the lack of hardware IPD was a problem, but found ways to move the headset around to get ok results.Also think this headset should be $100 less then the Quest, I think a lot more goes into the quest then the rift s.  Also having an $80 cable to replace in near future is ridiculous IMO, since all it is a display port and usb cMaybe next gen will be better?

My IPD is 70, and this headset still looks pretty good. I adjust the headset to make my dominate eye (right eye) is clear and my left eye will look a little fuzzy, but my brain adjusts. It's not perfect, but I get used to it. I really wish there was a way to adjust the IPD mechanically. I'm planning on upgrading to a Valve Index in the future because of the manual IPD adjust. Until then, this headset works just fine. I do love the controllers, and I believe they're the best on market in my opinion. Main reason I don't want to switch to Valve is not only because they're way too expensive, but the controller sucks compared to Oculus. Other than that, it was very easy to setup, I encountered very few bugs. If you close a game out, sometimes it doesn't shut down properly and you'll have to reboot your computer. The headset speakers are trash. I recommend just using headphones or just use desktop speakers if you're playing a music game like Beat Saber. These have the worst speakers on the market, they're like 2 watt 1990's speakers that come with your Compaq Presario. Not even joking, they're a step up from internal motherboard speakers.

I owned a DK2 at one point and while it was an interesting proof of concept, it was a mediocre device. I've been using the Rift S for a few weeks now and while not perfect, it is a true, fully functioning, decent device that does what it claims. There may be better displays, but for $400, it's an excellenr deal!Tracking is done by integrated cameras, requiring a lit room so they can see. Never had any tracking issues.Image quality is decent and certainly serviceable, but I understand there are better displays. Still, this isn't disappointing in the least, and woll certainly tide me over until future gens arrive.Oculus software seems a weaklink. I have experienced numerous crashes, however if it fails, it's usually as soon as you start it so it hasn't actually be disruptive. I have had several instances of the software running amok and pegging my cpu at 100% nearly locking up my system when it SHOULD have merely been idling in the background.Audio is usable but mediocre, as is the mic. I have a dedicated headset.Hand devices are a necessity, and these work very well! Again for $400 it's a steal!I feel the ORS offers an affordable and enjoyable VR experience, even my mom liked it a lot. One caveat is 9/10 producers of VR content, particularly videos, are idiots and violate most the ''donts'' of VR, but that's not Oculus' fault.

I know this is a little unfair but that is how furious I am.  I didn’t even get to TRY this VR set yet.  Guess what, my computer system is way over powered to handle this spec wise.  I built it myself, adding upgraded parts over the years.  Many of you know what I mean.  Because of this I’m able to stretch computer parts years past their prime.  For example I still run an AMD Phenom chip which was brand new around 2012.  It is at 3.2Ghz stock and can handle just under 4 while overclocked.  The developers at Oculus decided to put a block on my CPU as well as all others that don’t have some new feature called SSE 4.0.  Basically it’s one of the latest hardware features that new chips have but it means nothing for raw computing power.  I have proof that my system was just fine and would have worked.  If you google this issue “ Oculus Rift S software installation problems” you will see countless posts with the same story as me.  The only difference is some people bought their Oculus when it was new so the software at that time did not have the blocks for the CPU in it.  So imagine how incredible more angry I would be if like them I have been using my device for a few years then suddenly one day they force an update and I can’t use it anymore because someone at Oculus decided my chip can not handle their hardware.  Needless to say this is a serious problem and it forced people with perfectly functioning systems to upgrade.  When I get this working on the new hardware I will revisit and write a fair review but I wanted to put this out there for anyone who may want this unit bit does not have a computer newer than 2018.  Check that toy have the SSE 4.0, both intel and Amd have it apparently.  Even still the software does have some other issues from what I’ve read.  Just be careful, don’t end up like me and be disappointed and not even get to try it because you don’t have a less than 3 year old computer.  Also make sure you have a display port.  The old Rift had HDMI like most interfaces.  They decided to change it on this model.  Also if this wasn’t enough already, there is no way to adjust the distance between the 2 screens (IFF) so if your biology doesn’t allow your eye balls to be in the narrow range that the set is designed for you may have issues with comfort or even seeing the screen clear.  This is something they changed as well.  The old model did have the adjustment.

Quite simply the worst product buying experience I've ever had.The Oculus Rift S ""worked"" with brand new PC for about three weeks (always freezing, disconnecting, losing hand controllers, etc.) until one day it just stopped connecting.Since that point, I've spent countless futile hours trying to troubleshoot a clearly defective unit. The Oculus support team initially responded to me with standard-response troubleshooting checklists that didn't address my issue, after which we started a feedback loop where I would report back that none of the steps worked, and they would send me another canned response of additional troubleshooting steps.Each time we did this I would have to download / export my file logs and send to Oculus for their review. Despite having all of my logs and forcing me to prove I've adequately taken each individual troubleshooting step from their boilerplate response list which never addressed my underlying issue, I've now been told that my request is undergoing a 7 business day review in a different department for further troubleshooting steps.I just want to race in VR. I don't want to keep wasting hours and hours with Oculus trying to get a ""top of the line"" unit to even turn on properly. Where is the quality control? Where is the customer service? Why is it so hard to just exchange my freaking unit instead of sending me another 12 steps that clearly won't help? I've tried to email and I've tried to chat online, but somehow I can't reach someone who agrees that $400 should get you more than an uncomfortable sleep mask with zero redeeming technological use.For $400, you may get a functioning Oculus Rift S. You may also get a bureaucratic nightmare where you can't actually speak to anybody on the phone because ""they don't support voice service"" and the online service representatives are plainly happy to keep you stuck in the system with no resolution, transferred to ""another department"" where you're just supposed to sit by until they finally figure out a problem they've spent the last several days trying to identify.Please fix this Oculus - I will revise review if and when you do. Just to emphasize the point further, I could not be more dissatisfied with either the product I purchased or the support service I've received from Oculus.

Prescription lenses for the Oculus made this much more amazing. I've had issues with my computer finding it from time to time. The cord is annoying and after comparing it with the quest I don't really see much benefit yet to needing the rift + the computer. Most games are on both and a lot of games aren't cross play compatable between rift and quest so I can't play with my non PC friends that have quest. It's not mobile like the quest so I have to pack up my computer to travel with it. The biggest benefit is I can store a lot more games because it uses my pc hard drive. I haven't explored steam VR games too much yet so I might find some good stuff there but as of today I wish I would have gotten the quest instead of the rift because it might be too early to need the processing power of the computer. Overall though I love it.

Pros:What's SDE?Longer CableReduced God RaysHigher Res DisplayNo Physical Setup RequiredPass through+ Is ConvenientThe Lenses Are Much ClearerThe Headband Mount Is A Lot More ComfortableCons:The Audio Is sh!tThe Tracking Is WorseAfter my cousin and I swapped over from playing on the Rift to the Rift S, we immediately noticed that the tracking (at least for my unit) was not even close to the Rift’s external tracking. I was so pumped to get going with the Rift S but now I’m contemplating on returning it. The controllers feel very different (smaller and lighter with new rectangular straps....I have large hands and always remove the straps when I play). There’s next to none when it comes to vibration output from the new controllers (at least while playing Beat Saber). The pass-through is very cool and useful but while looking through the cameras, there’s a wobbly effect (as if there was screen tearing with a wave effect to it) and its resolution is low which leads me back to the tracking. 5 cameras and it’s not tracking as smoothly as my Rift’s 3x sensor setup or as all of the reviewers put it out to be. The highest score I got in Beat Saber was an S on one of my favorite songs that I always ranked SS on when I was played on the Rift. And both my cousin and I have been going back and forth and our scores are just falling short from what we’ve been able to set while using the Rift. It’s not as smooth or accurate and again, the lack of vibrations in the new touch controllers made playing Beat Saber feels so foreign to us that we both just quit.The resolution bump on the other hand, phew. If this small increase created this much of a sharper image I could only imagine how HP’s Reverb looks in person. Basing it off of YouTube comparison videos was noticeable but in person, it's actually is a game-changer. So much to the point where I don’t want to put my Rift back on. The resolution increase, new head strap, and lenses are probably the only things preventing me from sending it back at the moment since they’re such an improvement over the Rift. Another thing, during the initial setup, my Rift S was stuck in a loop trying to find it’s sensors. I pressed buttons on both controllers as you’d do with the Rift, had no luck, swapped USB ports, no luck, but it wasn’t until I placed the two controllers on the floor raised the Rift S above the controllers and tried again that it worked. Another thing to note is that my Oculus app will randomly close and restart itself or the image on the HMD will become frozen. A few times after starting a song on Beat Saber I’d notice a flash on the screen that appeared to artifacting, like a flash of white noise. I’m going to take a break, do a fresh install of Oculus and use my pair of headphones when I attempt to play it again later today. Hopefully, the tracking is drastically improved with a few updates that or I hope I have a defective unit. Hell, at this point I’ll gladly take the case being that I have a defective unit. Why? Cause that would mean that the only thing bad about the HMD is it’s integrated audio.

I have been gaming for 25+ years and have been underwhelmed by anything new since the era of Counter Strike, UT and Half life 2, etc. to the point I got so bored I quit gaming for a while... then I put these on and I AM BLOWN AWAY beyond words. The immersion is incredible. I challenge anyone who doubts that VR is the future of gaming to try it - the switch from PC or console to this I would describe as the leap from a 90's Game Boy to a PS4. Or from playing with a stick in the dirt to riding a dirtbike. Nokia 3310 to iPhone.Granted, this is my first VR headset, I have been thinking about getting into VR for a while. If you have never tried VR GO FOR IT, if not with the rift s then get a different one - it really is like you're really in the game, it can't be described, it needs to be experienced. I have nothing to compare it to but so far I am not regretting the Rift S as my weapon of choice, can't think of anything I dislike so far. I based my decision on content available and the controllers.Edit: I came back here to see why this only has 3 and a half stars on Amazon. A lot of the bad reviews are from people who only realized after purchase that they need a display port instead of HDMI port (and no, an adapter will not work). So if you are thinking of getting into VR this is a GOOD headset, don't pay attention to the negative reviews that didn't check their specs!

This is my first entry into VR, I tried the Dev kit back in 2013 and the Rift S is much improved. It's not very comfortable and seems like it needs to be tight to get the picture clear, not sure how this compares to other headsets. I like the Oculous store and games they offer on it, I still think there needs to be more full length games, I see a lot of shovelware and games with crap graphics. This is why I waited until the end of 2020 to jump on VR. The audio quality is ok but not great. Now if you can actually get this headset for $299-$399 then its worth it, but don't pay any more than that. It pissed me off that there was NO sale for black friday so I bought it for $399, then a week later it briefly dropped to $299. I would return it but I see the price is back up. Overall i'd give this 4/5. One thing I do like about the Oculous as well is the availability, they seem in no short supply while other headsets like the Index you have to wait 30 weeks or something to get it. When I purchase something that expensive I want it ASAP.

What I did like about it is the ergonomics and sharpness. Much better than the CV1. But it ends there.This thing uses one screen instead of two. Which means it would not properly line up to both of my eyes. This was not an issue with the older rift headset. No matter what when I is constantly slightly blurred over the other.Like others mentioned, not having tracking cameras is a real problem as it’s trying to calculate your position which might give artifacts and motion stutters.This means you almost always have to have lights on in the room, and what was great about the CV1 headset is it basically worked in the dark.I bought the Vive cosmos last year, and words cannot describe how much of a disaster that was. I finally gave the rift S a try only to find that it is pretty much equally on par a disaster.I’ll hold out for HP’s new headset... as there is no point in getting an Index at this point.

I hate to dump 2 stars on this because when it works the Rift S works great.  I was worried about getting another camera based system after having owned an ms mixed reality headset where controllers would often go out of view and stop working.  The Rift has been great in that regard.. but after 5 months or so of normal use it started experiencing random disconnect issues that progressively got worse.  It took support almost 6 weeks to walk me thru a ridiculous amount of troubleshooting and replacement.  Then they sent me a refub that has now lasted less than 4 months and is doing the same thing as before.  I dont know if I even want to bother trying to get it fixed again.  Very depressing after dropping 400$.  Would not buy again.Update 2/16/2021.  Been in an email support loop hell for 6 weeks now.  They seem to refuse to admit it's just broken and keep asking me the same questions.. check your driver!  check your usb power config!  check the software version!  send me logs!  But THE HEADSET IS BROKEN.UPDATE 6/01/2021After many weeks of back and forth I was finally offered a replacement.  Thankfully they did it past the warranty date because it was.broken before the warranty was up and recognized the process had taken forever to diagnose.  The new headset is working so I will update this review if it lasts more than 6 months like the last two.

I have had this device for over a year.  It works when it wants too.  Updates cause it to get confused, usb ports get it confused, display port issues which involve lots of unplugging and plugging back in.  If this worked, when it worked the headset was a lot of fun.  However, I spend more time trying to get it to work right or a game to work right so I would not recommend it.  Also search google on how the Oculus folks have never really fixed it even though its all over the web and usually give folks the standard tech support checklist run around.  No thanks.  Don't want others to spend hard earned money on something this sub par.

It took me a long time to catch the VR bug, and I'm certainly glad I waited. No external sensors necessary and some interesting upgrades make this the best VR system, IMO. And it doesn't have to go near the high end version of the Vive at over $1000. I got this unit for $400. I spent 3+ hours in VR last night after a LENGTHY install/update process. It was my first time ever to step in to the VR realm, and I loved it. Beat Saber and Rogan. Quite the experience, but even more than that...I felt like I had completed a full workout afterward. This wonderful device seems to have unlimited potential as an exercise tool.So far, the only thing I don't like about it is the cable that tethers you to your computer, but until wireless tech has an incredible breakthrough, it is unavoidable. I would love to not be chained down to my computer, but it isn't worth the drop in performance and game library to go with one of the standalone units like Quest or Go.

Bought this for a friend at $399.00 all said, done and delivered $427. Friend recieved the unit and it would not work for more than 15 minutes, sometimes not at all. Trouble shoot forums and trouble shooting from slow ass oculus support lead to a faulty head unit 3months into the ownership of this Facebook own crap. Took a month to get another head unit, a refurbished one at that. So, now 4 months into this project and it actually works. Worked for 3 weeks then black screen, no video at all. Now, oculus takes weeks to reply to trouble shoot, and now, because it was purchased through Amazon, a refund, even though 30 days is long gone is off the table and my buddy now owns a $427 desktop paper weight. Thanks Facebook Oculus 🖕

Oculus does not tell you that if you wear glasses, they can push against the lenses inside the headset. After only a week or two of use, this can cause a permanent scratch in the Oculus lenses. You will see noticeable spots in your view which can not be removed with lens cleaner or anything else. The headset has been permanently damaged, and the damage will get progressively worse.Obviously, the designers knew people may wear glasses, because they added a button on the bottom of the headset to increase the space (by an infinitesimally small amount) between your eyes and the lenses. But this does not prevent your glasses from contacting the Oculus lenses at all.They COULD have designed rings around the Oculus lenses to keep your glasses from touching them. Here is a 3D printed product on Amazon that does exactly that.  (If Amazon no longer offers it, you can find it elsewhere by doing a Google search.) I did not use the plastic film protectors offered as a solution on Amazon because they all have terrible reviews and they add an optical layer which may decrease the image quality.https://smile.amazon.com/Printed-Protectors-Oculus-No-Operating-System/dp/B081MQPL2D/ref=sr_1_10?crid=400XWPDYYXMU&keywords=oculus+rift+s+lens+protector&qid=1577023591&sprefix=oculus+rift+s+lens%2Caps%2C147&sr=8-10

Before dropping $400 on the Rift S, I HIGHLY recommend doing your research on the hardware requirements. I can guarantee that a bunch of the 1-star ratings are simply because customers are too lazy to look at product specs/requirements FIRST before buying. Here are a few:- PC must have either a DisplayPort or MiniDP (for laptops). If you don't have either, your PC probably doesn't meet the hardware requirements.- USB 3.0 port. For some peculiar reason the Rift S wouldn't detect my 3.0/3.1 ports when I connected directly to my mobo, so I hard to connect to the USB port on the top of my case instead (and it worked). This really shouldn't have been an issue.- GTX1060 or similar specs.- No IPD adjustment. Check your IPD for compatibility before buying.Pros:- Affordable. You can't beat the price with other competitors. If price is an issue, I would still recommend this headset over Windows Mixed Reality headsets since it's compatible with most SteamVR games.- Works well with glasses (I have fairly large frames).- Only one long cable, which splits into 2 at the end (DP & USB). Makes your play area/desk space looks less messy.- Oculus Guardian is super helpful. Say people barge into your room very often (which is an issue for me). As soon as you move out of your defined ""play area"", your view switches from your game to the cameras built into the headset. That way you can see what's happening outside the VR and you're more spatially aware.- Removable frame. You should take it out regularly and clean the foam bc of sweat, or if you're sharing the headset.- 2 built-in audio ports for headphones.Cons:- Lack of IPD adjustment. I've had at least 5 others try on this headset though and proper fitting hasn't been an issue (yet).- Oculus software can be annoying. I mostly only play Beat Saber & sometimes it ""forgets"" where my play area is, so I have to re-setup Guardian (doesn't take too long, but it's still a hassle).- Plan on investing in rechargeable batteries (one set usually lasts 2-3 years, with constant use). With around 40ish hours on Beat Saber and 5 on miscellaneous games, I've already been through 4 sets of AA batteries (so 8 in total).- Tracking isn't the best. It's hard to play some Expert+ songs on Beat Saber bc as soon as I reach too far out or even slightly behind me, it doesn't track the controller. So I end up having to hit the notes directly in front of me as much as possible. However with the recent Oculus firmware update it hasn't been as much of an issue.- Small speakers, lack of bass. Not the worst but certainly not good enough for audio-based games like Beat Saber. Definitely plan to use earbuds/headphones. Mine come off sometimes when I play Beat Saber (bc the wire gets in the way), so I'll probably be using Bluetooth instead.After experimenting with the headset for almost a month, I decided overall it was worth the investment and I'll be keeping it. Honestly just research thorougly, read through other reviews, and it may be the perfect headset for you.

Great for anyone first timers into PC VR. Or just want a headset with simplistic but with great tracking without spending an arm and leg.  I myself am a HTC Vive and Oculus Rift CV1 owner . While CV1 was a great headset. The tracking was a pain. Each sensor uses one USB so a total of 4 USB ports had to be used to run the thing. Using lots of resources that actually add lag to tracking, especially when using my gaming laptop.  The rift S on the other hand. Only needs ONE USB port and a display port. That’s it!Upon opening the box, the contents were well presented, come with two controllers, two AA batteries, a DP to mini DP adapter and documentation along with headset and a nice long cable (longer then CV1) same as VIVE.  Unfortunately no microfiber cloth is included (just like my quest) So make sure you buy a pack here on amazon.  Only cost a buck.Setup is easy. And love the inside out tech on this. I’ve had bad experience with inside outside tracking with a wmr headset. But could of been just that headset (Acer). On the rift S it enters pass through mode. Where you can see your surrounds. Not only they but you can actually set up your boundaries that way as well.  Much easier then CV1 and no need to walk around the room for setup  like the Vive/Vive Pro and Index headsets do.Display is a 80hz LCD panel. While it’s 80Hz as opposed to the normal 90hz. I really felt no differences between them two.  LCD is a plus over the rift and Vive. because it uses RGB (3 color square) strips as opposed to pentile (2 color;triangle) strips on OLED. The blacks were dark enough to not actually bother me.  The texts appear sharp, very little  god rays (reflection of bright objects from display to lens).  Overall very present experience.  Display is one panel. So no manual IPD adjustments. (Only software basted)Tracking... this is a biggie.  I am glad to say that tracking is amazing on this little guy. A pro shooter or pro Beat saber shouldn’t have to worry about limiting factors when it comes to tracking.  Rift S did get a software update back in July that fixed the tracking bug. So if you’ve been reading reviews around July and before. They are no longer valid. Tracking occlusion isn’t an issue anymore for anyone who does two handed gun shooters. Behind your back tracking will not work. But if you are concerned of reaching something behind your back (Rec Room, Golden trophy quest, example or Echo Arena) fear not. It’ll work, using prediction software on where your hand is at when it’s he is your back. (Quick grab, etc) it runs quite well for that!Controllers have a cheaper feel compare to the CV1. But does feel more comfortable then CV1 and actually feel more like the Vive wants. Just smaller.  I love the fact that they take AA batteries rather then internal lithium ion battery. As you can simple swap them when your batteries start to die.  Oculus software will let you know before they completely die on you.  If you are an VR enthusiast or one of those game junkies (spending 24 hours in VRChat; for example). I would recommend doing rechargeable AA batteries then alkaline. To save you money.Audio. This is why I docked a star.  Audio quality is horrible.  Both speaker and microphone.  For speaker. I got myself a snap on earpieces. (Made a review on it) to solved the audio issue.  Mic quality is not the clearest. And audiophiles will not like it (like me) so I got an external mic for quality video captures or streams.  I’m disappointed at Oculus/Lenovo for taking this route.  It’s VR and audio should be on the top.  So far the VIVE/Index has best audio (built in) while Rift/index has best mic quality. Rift S is the worst on both departments, not happy with that; once again third party accessories fixed it for me. But it’s unnecessary.Compatibility:  If your PC has at least an i3 (6100) and a GTX 960/1050. Has a display port and has one USB 3.0 port. Then you’re all set.  If your desktop has a HDMI port, it WILL NOT WORK. Even if you use an adapter for it. Just Display port/Virtual link or thunderbolt 3 ports it’ll work on. But not HDMI.  Those who use a gaming laptop. Make sure you have one that had a display port/miniDP/USB C-TB3 port.  Most of the negative reviews are basted on poor user research.Bottom line. I think the rift S is the best (all round headset to get) You have access to both Oculus and Steam VR stores. Can map steam Vive controllers to this rift S controller if wanted to.  Very pleased with this item. Halo strap makes wearing this thing very comfortable, if adjusted right. It doesn’t feel like you have a VR headset on. Just a baseball cap. If you are on the fence to get this headset. Don’t hesitate and buy.

This VR headset is awesome, and opened a whole new world, it's easy to forget that..well, that it's not real. Easy to set up because it does not require external sensors for the head tracking. I'm new to VR, so not going to nitpick on specs, the fact is the immersive experience is nothing like I've ever seen. If you have the means, I would connect it to an above recommended newer gaming PC and fast internet, just to get the most out of it.I use it it extensively with the free Google Earth VR from the Oculus Store, and to travel the world, and that alone was worth it, just be sure to learn all the controls and options to fully enjoy it, including street view and the way the controllers interact with each other and flying around, set the sun for day-night-sunrise, etc. The controllers are labeled with floating sticker, and a small reference globe, so it's easy.  Tip; whichever way you point the ""laser beam""  on the right hand control, that's the direction you'll be flying, sideways, up-down, limitless. Speed is dependent on how far the joystick on the controller is moved. Point the laser at the globe floating above the left hand controller and the globe becomes bigger, with the blue peg for current position and the red peg moving with the laser, if the trigger is squeezed, you'll be transported instantly to the new location on the globe the red peg was. Some street views include inside shops and hotels to look around. I use it to plan trips, and mountain trails to learn the level of difficulty before hand. Very impressive. If you run X-Plane 11, this VR will give a whole new experience to flying, with depth perception and real 3D cockpit and real time head tracking with 360 view. And you can lean to the side and stick your head out through the plane's side, after all it's VR. Yes, your joystick will work the same way as on flat panels.  In my opinion it was a good move by Oculus to not to attach a headphone to the head set, so you can hear the sound from the head band just enough to be somewhat useful, but still hear around you, or you can plug in your own favorite one for better sound and full immersion anyway. Tons of VR games are available on both Oculus and Steam stores, many are free or trial. There maybe better headsets available, but what for, at this price point the Rift S was well worth buying.

This thing is way better than the original. Tracking is infinitely easier to setup and you don't have to worry about USB running to all the sensors. The screen is much better and pixels are not as noticeable. Unfortunately it has one major downside, you cannot adjust the distance between lenses. As such depending on the distance between your pupils it may work great or it may be impossible to get perfect sharp focus. It is still playable and overall enjoyable, but everything will always be a bit blurry and text will look awful.The built in audio is also pretty subpar. You can freely attach your own headphones and try to fit them around the headset (which doesn't attach very stably and move around easily in high intensity games) or use external speakers as the audio source but its a bit of a let down.Overall for the price its a much better entry into VR and a decent step forward, but depending on your own body it may work great or be barely passable which is a pretty terrible design choice on their part to exclude so many users or force them to have a bad time.

To start, I was a bit of a VR skeptic; I had used mobile-based VR experiences like the Gear VR before, but I was never impressed. To say my expectations were extremely low was an understatement. This will play into my opinions a lot. Also, this review is LONG. If you want a TLDR, then look at the summary bit at the bottom. It sums it up pretty well.Shipping:Shipping was fast. Even with the 4th of July, it still shipped to my door in 3 days (Excluding the weekend), and the packing was as expected for Amazon. The retail box was packed very nicely into another slightly larger box, held in with closed-cell foam. (This was nice because it looks like it was dropped at some point, but only the outer box was damaged, the retail box was pristine until I got my grubby hands on it.) However, Amazon, PLEASE learn how to pack things. That box was then just loosely set into a MUCH larger box with NO padding, allowing this inner box to slide around like crazy. If it wasn't for the foam inside the inner box, I can guarantee this item would have been DOA.Unboxing:Now to get into the actual product, opening the retail packaging, I was pleasantly surprised to see everything nicely laid out and presented in a way that was easy to access and understand—no digging under packaging for that one random adapter, no shifting things over to find the batteries. You lift the headset and controllers out of their molded plastic holder, then everything else is in a nice little packet, just waiting to be opened. Honestly, this box should make a great storage case for those who need somewhere to store their HMD when not in use.Setup:One of the Rift S's strong points over other pc-powered VR solutions is the lack of lighthouses and external sensors. Because of that, the footprint and setup time are cut significantly. With the Rift S, you install the Oculus software, follow the instructions, plug in the headset when prompted, and then sit through the firmware updates and MANDATORY safety video that you CANNOT skip. (Honestly, I see why it's done this way, but it's annoying as hell.) (UPDATE: I believe they've made this skippable now.) After that, it will prompt you to put on the HMD, and then you're off. You will set up the guardian system, set your height, and then go through a very nice demo walking you through the quirks and controls of your new environment. After that, you're ready to play.Gameplay:Once I was ready to play, I was immediately greeted by one of the little quirks of VR gaming on the PC: Steam VR on the Oculus headsets is not natively supported, you have to enable 3rd party applications in the Oculus app. (Thankfully, Steam has a nice page showing you how it's done, and once it's set it remembers your settings.) I then loaded up Beat Saber for a trial run. Honestly, I'm impressed. Wearing the headset is comfortable, and easy to forget that it's there, and the build-in speakers are decent enough for most average listeners. They won't win any awards, they're a little tinny and lack bass, but I don't mind. There is a headphone jack for those who want a better experience but don't expect to fit any headphones over the headband. My Corsair Void RGB headset only kind of fits and is rather uncomfortable after a while. Tracking is great. I never found myself losing tracking, although it is still a little glitchy when the controller is right next to the headset, like in Pavlov or other FPS games. The screen is decent, I never found my self getting disoriented when moving my head, (although it is worth noting that for a VR novice, moving in game is rather nauseating at first) and the resolution is, again, good enough. There is definite screen-door effects, but it's easy to forget unless you're trying to read smaller text, and the LCD does show some weakness. Blacks aren't really black, but more of a grey and contrast could be improved. But I'm blaming that on the panel, as LCD tech can't achieve true black.Summary:Sorry for the long review. If you don't want to read the whole thing, then come down here for a TLDR. Overall, the headset is great for a first-time VR user, and even as an update (or so I hear) from first-gen VR setups like the original Rift or Vive. (Not the pro, I don't have enough info to make that comparison) The headset is light, the speakers are adequate, and the tracking is great. I would recommend this product.UPDATE 4/15/21:After using this headset for almost two full years, I can now say that I've become experienced enough to update this review. The Rift S still works phenomenally. the headset is still as clear and snappy as day one, with only one controller breaking. (I smashed them together and snapped the tracking ring. It still works, though!) Tracking did not hold up so well, however. After using a Quest 2, I can say that tracking is definitely buggy and tends to ""drift"" when the controllers hit problem areas like close to the edge of the cameras' vision. I have ordered a Valve Index, so hopefully, soon, I'll be able to say for sure if this is a limitation of Oculus's ""Inside-Out"" tracking or just an issue with VR in general. After experiencing the increase in pixel density on the Quest 2, I can say that the resolution is INCREDIBLY limited. For first-time users, this works well, but for anyone with experience, this would be a noticeable downgrade, even from a CV1. (Oculus is discontinuing the Rift S, so this is a moot point now, but it's still worth mentioning.) TLDR: Oculus made this headset obsolete very quickly. That makes it hard to recommend to anyone. Just buy a Quest 2.

I purchased my Rift S in the summer of 2019. The first thing I and many users notice with their Rift S is its use of Oculus Insight Tracking. Unlike many other VR systems on the market, the Rift S does not use external cameras, instead, it has them built into the headset. Many users, including myself, have found this very cost-effective and user-friendly.Another thing that I notice is the new optical lenses that reduce the screen door effect, which is the mesh-like appearance on a screen, that I have experienced on other headsets. The headset was comfortable to me as it had two adjustment dials/buttons to help it stay on your head and be able to comfortably see the screen. Plus if I ever needed to wear my glasses I could adjust the headset to fit over my glasses. You can also buy prescription lenses for the headset.My first time using the Rift S was very simple. After the initial startup, which required a lot of agreeing to stuff, I went into the regular start-up sequence, which was adjusting your height and making a play area. I then moved on to games like Beat Saber and Blade and Sorcery. Even while playing these fast-moving games the headset could easily track my movements and rarely had problems. The only time I ever experienced a failure in tracking was if the sensors were smudge. The gameplay itself was extremely immersive as well.  The only major downside to the Rift S is customer support. The Oculus Support Center is extremely slow and also provides awful solutions that never help to correct the issue. So be aware that when you buy this product you’ll most likely be on your own. Even though the Rift S has awful support, its user-friendliness, comfort, and gameplay make up for it. With a price of $399, it is a more affordable choice than many other VR headsets. I was genuinely satisfied with the product and will definitely buy more products from Oculus.

When it comes to VR, I’m fresh meat as some would say. I’ve done my research and even finally picked one of these bad boys up for myself! There are some areas where this headset truly shines in and some that....still needs to be worked on.One massive pro is the adjustable halo strap on the headset! It makes it so easy to adjust to many different head sizes. Overall just a comfortable fit. The crisp, clear quality of the games I play look so good as well! God rays are almost completely gone (still appear from time to time but very faint). So far, no light leakage from the headset so it doesn’t break immersion. The tracking cameras are now internal (5 cameras in total) instead of external. So there is no hassle of setting up external cameras around your room with the problem of wires being everywhere. There is a feature called world guard. You can draw out your play space and anytime you exit to the other side of this wall you create it’ll let you view the real world and also prevents you from bumping into stuff and let you know if you’re getting close to this wall. I even like the feature to double tap the Oculus home button to view the real world (which is turned off by default but can be enabled).This headset is a fantastic option for those looking to get into VR gaming and/or don’t want to drop the extra money for an HTC Vive.This headset is absolutely amazing but it doesn’t come without its problems. One defiantly being the controller tracking. Internal sensors in the headset are good but aren’t great. It wasn’t long until, after a day of having this headset, that I noticed tracking issues pretty often. 90% of the time it tracks pretty well but the other 10% happens usually when I play an FPS game like Pavlov. Using both hands/controllers to hold a gun and aim seems to really mess with the tracking. Mainly because one controller is close to your face and the other is almost completely hidden by the other controller out of the cameras sight.This may vary from person to person but I personally don’t like how the controllers can sense your middle finger, pointing finger, and thumb when it is and isn’t on the controller buttons. For instance, if you are holding the controller and lift your middle finger, and pointing finger up but keep the rest on the controller it’ll make a peace sign (in games that support that. I personally would only like to press the buttons in order to move my fingers. Unfortunately, there isn’t an option to turn that off. Some may like that feature, but I personally don’t and would love for an option to disable that.I also really don’t like how to cord for the headset is really noticeable. Without some Velcro to kinda adjust it so it goes over your shoulder instead of resting on it then you’ll defiantly notice it a lot. Unfortunately I find myself touching and stepping on the wire with my feet from time to time.Overall, an amazing headset! I definitely recommend it to anyone looking to get into Vr Gaming. It comes with some problems but they can be easily ignored when you’re having too much fun!

This headset is my first adventure in VR, so take that in to account with this review.Setup was a breeze, the only complaint was the time it took to download the software, which was several Gigs of data, so I understand. Other than that, it was simple as following clear instructions and in moments I was ready to go. The guardian system was very easy to setup and works surprisingly well.First impressions were incredible. If you've never experienced Vr before, it is like a whole world in the headset. Besides from the cable that I was gently reminded of, nothing gave me any indication that I was still in my apartment. I actually felt as if I had transported to a new world! Tracking was excellent, not at like the wii or playstation motion controls I was worried it would be like.The audio is like many states, lacking bass and presence, but besides being a touch quiet, actually was not too bad. Of course you can use your own headphones, but the design of the audio on the headset allows you to still stay aware of your surroundings if you need to be, which is preferable if you are playing while loved ones watch, you can still communicate with each other which makes the experience much more inclusive. I tried using in ear headphones and honestly I did not like how isolated from the real world I felt, so to each their own.The experience is like nothing you have had before, I recommend everyone try it to really understand why VR is such a big deal, and for me seems to make traditional games less appealing. The virtual desktop is also very cool, since I can access my desktop in a very intuitive way, browsing the internet on a screen that I can control the size of, effectively turning my 32 in. Monitor into a screen that is as big as my field of vision.If you have nothing to compare it to, you will be blown away like I am. My only gripe is that once in a while, the headset will freeze, like it has been disconnected, and turns black. That interrupts any game you were in and leaves you as a sitting duck. It is a frustrating experience absolutely, but it only happens occasionally, and it is something I hope will be fixed with future updates.Edit: In the hopes that someone sees this and can offer a solution, or at least that others are aware of the potential problem, I had to move to 3 stars for now. The random disconnecting issue seems to have no end in sight, despite every potential fix I can find online. Some offered short relief like disabling USB power saving modes, but constantly being catapulted out of VR when you're fully immersed is a terrible feeling.When it works, it's amazing. I understand that not everyone is having this problem, but I am not the only one. I really hope I don't have to return it.

UPDATE: Oculus has since updated their firmware and apparently the dead zone issue is less of a problem near the face. However it will not track behind you still for advanced combat moves and users.First the good:The screen is FAR better than the CV1. At this price point this headset is all you need for simracing, flight sims. You can read every dial and judge every turn.The Problem:Every game that has scope gunplay, archery, or advanced grabbing mechanics like the Echo titles where grabbing a disk behind your back is a useful skill, is now unplayable in the Rift S. At least in terms of doing what you could on the CV1. Many of these broken games are the most played content on their store. (See example list below.)To make it worse, the CV1 is also no longer available to buy. So there is literally no Oculus hardware being produced that can fully run these games.It would be like if Microsoft removed XBox controllers from the market while pushing their new N64 cloned controller with one thumb stick. Every single game that needs two thumb sticks will no longer work as intended.Examples:The examples listed below are just a few games available in the Oculus store with no warning about it not working properly on ANY available Oculus hardware since the CV1 was taken down.Onward: Can't rack pistoles due to the top ring getting in the way. Can't scope.Zero Caliber: Can't scope guns or hold two handed rifles. (They might be working on a fix)Echo Arena: Can't rotate hand behind you to hold your position and still dodge in time. Causes a delay. You also can't grab disks behind your back or hear someone comping up behind you due to the audio issues.Lone Echo: Can't grab behind you for basic movement and hold positions.ANY game with archery & slingshot mechanics: Too many to list. You now have to draw your arrow with ""hip fire"" and hope for the best. Or struggle to get a sight line at the corner of your mouth where it should be.I will give them a month. If it is not fixed by enabling the old CV1 sensor to track your hands on the Rift S, which they have said is possible but refuse to do it becuase of the work involved, then I will have no choice but to refund this headset.And what a shame that would be if I have to return it. Because literally everything else, except audio, is an amazing upgrade. The screen is amazing.The godray effect is mostly gone. The screen door effect is almost none existent and the only pixels you see are from the games itself not being rendered higher.The pass through technology to see your environment, in 3D stereo, is amazing for working at your desk with a virtual floating monitor and seeing the keyboard and mouse.And I haven't talked much about the audio. Which is pretty bad without investing in your own solution. And you can't use large over ear headphones due to the halo strap.I can only hope they fix the obvious flaws here before my refund window expires. This is the main reason I got it off Amazon first becuase I wasn't sure this new tracking would work.

6 months ago before purchasing this Oculus Rift S I had a HTC Vive.This is what I can tell you on the differences I feel.Pros:- Looks way way better than a HTC Vive, I can see more details and less pixelated.- I have myopia and I can use the Oculus Rift S without glasses, I cannot use HTC Vive without glasses. I believe this is because the OLED screen of the HTC Vive is too bright for me.- No base stations, I didn't like so many cables going around with the HTC Vive base stations.- See through! You can watch your environment through the headset cameras.- Cool controllers, it knows when you have your finger over a button without pressing it. Way better button layout than the HTC Vive.Cons:- Less colorful than HTC Vive.- The controllers uses batteries.- The controllers feels a little weak compared to the HTC Vive, I think I could break them with a medium force impact.- Tracking is limited to the headset cameras, so it won't track your controllers very good if you move them behind your back.- Requires an illuminated environment, I used to play in the dark with my old HTC Vive.Those are the most notorious differences I feel.Very good stuff but I believe it could be improved but hey, the price is very good so that balances it a lot.

 Been gaming since I could hold the NES controller in my hands at 4 years of age. Alot of milestones, Mario 3 and Legend of Zelda, then the Sega Genesis with Sonic and Mortal Kombat, you get me? This is how I always dreamed gaming would evolve to. The biggest part of VR that turned me off b4 was the sensors setup and all the USB ports taken up and wires everywhere...but the S makes it EZ. The S is perfect for the PC gamer who wants to lvl up his experience. The quest is perfect for gamers who want to try out VR (@ very low quality graphics) but don't have a PC. BUY ONE.

Let me just get straight to the point. Overall its a really cool product, I really enjoyed using this on my pc and trying all sorts of games, definitely fun and a new experience. The only problem I notice a lot is it can sometimes be a serious pain to connect them or get them working on a computer, can be glitchy at some points, I understand its not perfect but the part were you connect them to the computer needs improvement. I had to close and reopen programs or restart my computer multiple times to get them working sometimes and even after I get them to work then they will still have issues with some games as if they are not fully connected or something.

Overall, this device has some good improvements over the original rift. The headset is more comfortable. The resolution is noticeably better. The single cable design is nice now that the sensors are on the headset itself in the form of cameras. The cameras allow you to see the physical world inside of the virtual environment so you don't bump into things in your house. It's a very well implemented feature. I did not notice worse head tracking like some complained about. It feels instant to me. The controllers work well. The speaker is like a directional soundbar but it's not that loud or immersive. It gives you the ability to use your own headphones which is nice.Sounds like a complete improvement all around right? The one problem that renders it useless for me is they took away the ability to adjust the ipd. Or, the distance in mm between the center of both your eyes. It was a physical adjustment on the first rift and now it's done digitally in the settings. It does not work. Period. End of story... I have a large head and while the headset fits comfortably, The actual image I see is blurry on the outside edges. The usable image area is about 40% of the center. Look at your monitor, and chop off 30% on the right and left sides by making them blurry. That's what it feels like.They went to a ""one size fits all"" style but it eliminates roughly 30% of the population from being able to use this. I'm sure it was for cost savings and they probably knew it was going to be a problem for some.I loved the first consumer rift. I bought this one right around release. Now I want my original back. I think it was a poor decision to remove an important feature. I strongly recommend trying this somewhere before you buy it if you can.

Purchased as a Xmas gift for my son.  Worked great for a week but then it stopped connecting to the PC (USB3 and/or Display Port).  Exhausted online FAQs & forums before reaching out to Oculus support.  Could only find email - took a few days for them to respond - tried all of their suggestions with no success.  Waiting for the next round of tech support ping-pong with their email support team.  Will update and hopefully be able to improve rating if appropriate.Update: No tech support response from Oculus for 4 days (grrrrr).  Reached out to Amazon and arranged for an exchange.  Had a new system delivered within 24 hours and it is up and running.  Will update my star rating if the new system works consistently.  Now I just need to drop the old one off at Kohls.  Great Job Amazon - 5 star customer service!

I ended up sending my unit back as it had a dark line about 2/3 way up the screen (missing row of pixels). This is a good ""first Rift"" if you don't already own a CV1 Rift, or if you travel with your Rift and don't want to setup cameras. If you already have a well-functioning CV1 setup... I'd pass. I found that every ""advantage"" with this thing had a compromise. It feels much more like it was ""built to a price"" than the first Rift, and lacks the premium feel. Overall, this Rift feels like a plasticky consumer electronics device rather than high-end wearable tech.The gridded LCD is a little clearer than the CV1, especially for text. But it's not like moving to the Vive Pro where you immediately notice the higher resolution. Also, panning from left to right has sort of a strobing effect which I found uncomfortable. The halo-style head mount is more comfortable, but clunkier - the adjustment dial in particular feels cheap and imprecise. Also, the massive halo gets in the way of over-ear headphones, nullifying any advantages of the external headphone port. At least the Rift CV1 was low-profile enough to accommodate headphones. The hand grips are cheaper and track poorly close to your face (if playing In Death, or zooming with scopes in Fallout 4) -- yes, even with the firmware update that supposedly fixes this behavior.I would say the only noticeable improvement is the setup time. You do not have to run the camera setup like with the CV1. Everything else is worse, particularly the audio which is especially poor.

I have a fantastic computer, 1080 TI Hybrid SC, i7 4ghz. This thing can't even play a video without freezing completely. Everytime I load the oculus software it loses the settings for my boundaries and floor level. Sometimes after resetting all the device functions and going through the process, it still doesn't hold the settings and is unusable at a software level. I have reinstalled to a brand new fresh version of windows 10, all my drivers and firmware are up to date. Support is being generally useless and stating they will take 3-4 business days to respond for every step, and it's been a week and still no response from support. Exciting hardware but it's an absolute failure and unusable on a software level. I paid $400+ for a device that can't even function on a basic level.

The Oculus Rift S was mostly easy to set up on my powerhouse gaming desktop (i7-9700K running @ 3.6-4.9GHz, 32GB RAM @ 3200MHz, NVidia RTX2080ti w/11GB Video Memory, and 2 TB SSD and 1 TB Hard Drive. Runs pretty good, clear graphics and improved menus to get around. Steam VR (Valve Corporation) is working sufficiently.Also runs well on my Alienware laptop 17 R5 (2018) model with an i7-8750H running @ 2.2-3.9GHz, 32GB RAM @2667, SSD (2280-Crucial P1000) and hard drive storage. Oculus Rift S comes with a Display Port to Mini-Display port adaptor. The mini-display port is located in the back of my laptop. Refer to your owners manual to locate where the port is located.The download of the Oculus Rift software Browser address bar ('oculus.com\setup') takes about an 45-70 minutes depending on your internet connection speed.Around a 7GB download and 13.8GB when extracted. If you only have a 256GB C:\ (System Drive) - You may be prompted to alter the destination drive to another drive location. I did the following and worked perfectly.I Downloaded the Oculus software again 'oculus.com\setup' And when the setup program prompted I selected Repair. After about 20+ minutes I restarted the system and everything is running just fine on the laptop (using alternate drive F:\oculus' .Remember if you don't have an available PC with the minimum requirements then purchase the Oculus Quest Headset.

So a couple things to note: the remotes use 1 AA battery per remote they do not recharge and the battery runs out very fast! I would recommend buying about 8 rechargeable batteries and a charger if you are going to be using this a lot.  The headset is adjustable in pretty much every way possible so it will always fit your head no matter how big or small, even kids. The controllers are definitely limited by hand size but i have quite small hands and they fit me perfect but i can see someone with large hand struggling to use them. Also one important thing that i did not expect, this headset is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH STEAM. You cannot buy games on the steam store and use them on the headset you HAVE to use the Oculus store. Also if you have a steam VRChat account you cannot use it with this headset. I had to make a whole new one. I hope this helped :)

This stuff is built like the Titanic, they assume it could never go wrong so they don't need to give you an interface that let's you do anything, it only ever starts with a ""Continue to VR to complete setup"".  That's great, but if the VR isn't working, how do I do that, and thus begins the loop. Their online support is completely useless and utterly basic. Games, programs, gaming consoles, and anything else I've ever touched always start with a program interface that let's do a few things, 1 of which is to launch the game/VR/etc.  Also there would be ""Support"", ""settings, etc.  Not this P-O-S.  Their Support says: Open the Oculus app on your PC. then Select Devices in the left menu. then Click Configure Rift, But none of that is possible since when I open their App, there is no interface, only a splash-screen telling me to go to the VR to continue setup.  Total GARBAGE.

I've read the previous negative user reviews, thinking that they were 5-6 months old thus should not be valid because a company like Facebook/Oculus must have fixed those issues but I was wrong.I have a desktop computer with specs: Intel 6600K, Asus Z170-A with native Intel 3.0 support, Asus ROG STRIX GTX 1070, GSKILL RIPJAWS X DDR4 2666Mhz etc. Os is Windows 10 Pro 1909 feature update with latest patches.Every single hardware has the latest stable driver and firmware (I check it weekly).First time application setup was frustrating. Oculus Home should be categorized as an alpha product. I wasn't able to complete the initial setup because the software didn't allow me to.After countless times, O was able to get passed the initial setup.Then I added my Rift S and began to test it. Tracking under sunlit or artificially well lit (Led lamps) room was not successful (light was not direct)Also the connection was constantly lost with displayport and usb 3.0 ports. Using this headset was impossible in these conditions.I've spent 3 days troubleshooting, researching on the web and Oculus forums.Every user who had the issues I had were agreed on one thing; Oculus Home wasn't tested enough and it's highly unstable.As some support staff and experienced users suggested, I've enrolled in the Public Test Channel and got the latest software and firmware but the issues continued.Right now I can't even use the headset for 1 minute. I've ordered a Usb 3.0 pci-e card to eliminate the possibility of fault at Usb ports.I'll try to reinstall Windows which is totally unnecessary and cumbersome.Re-downloading 8gb of data for Oculus Home software is another topic. A download link with the full installation of the software would be nice Oculus...I don't even recommend this product to my enemy.

I bought this because I believed that the Facebook\Lenovo\Oculus product partnership would yield a consumer ready product. It isn't.First *when* the Rift S works it is incredible. No complaints as to the quality build and performance *when* it works.  I am taking away three stars because the app is poorly developed.  I am reasonably computer savvy, but I don't have the experience to understand every nuance of Windows fiddling. There is a *lot* of fiddling to get this to work, and despite those efforts it is intermittently operational.Meaning *when* the Headset is recognized by the PC and the Oculus App.I purchased a Cyber Power PC that was ""Oculus Ready"" two years ago. It is well within the recommended specifications for the device, and I have upgraded many components.  More RAM SSDs, better cooling etc.Installing: Installation of the App is a 7+ GB download. If one has a slow connection this is a multi hour process. No disc is included.Upon installation it may or may not work right away without plugging and unplugging from the Display Port and USB 3.0 ports.Once it *is* running the device is very stable and performs well.  However, once the device goes to sleep, or the app is closed it struggles to wake up again.Then the chase begins of unplugging and plugging again, and about 1\2 of that time one is forced to watch a minute long safety video and acknowledge it as in the initial set up. Once set up there does not seem to be a away to disable this and It often looses the Gaurdian boundary, and that has to be reset 1\2 the time. So one is faced with setting this up over and over. It is not set it and forget it. (!)For a week I have fought with this for hours at a time. This brings the owner to the forums to get help. Oculus direct support is practically non existent. One is then faced with a myriad of disintegrated suggestions from individual users to solve the problems -and there is a myriad of various problems people are having. One is then led to dive more deeply into the Windows OS and begin fiddling with power options USB ports, drivers, selective suspend etc etc etc.  There is no clear and consistent path to make this work.For two days it was stable. Then upon rebooting my machine for some new software, the Oculus App suddenly displays a warning that the device is not compatible with Windows 8 and I need to upgrade to Windows 10!!! My computer came with Windows 10 and is fully updated to the latest 1909 build.  So now one must repair the App which is basically downloading it again. More hours of waiting on a slow connection and the side effects of loosing internet productivity.As I write this review the app is downloading for the fifth time...On top of this, I have spend extra money to upgrade and extend cables, upgrade GPU cooling, install dedicated USB 3.0 ports, and other parts like a dedicated sata card to make room for the GPU cooler in the PC.  So far this product is now costing me money which I spent under consumer confidence that this would be user friendly. It isn't. So far this has been more of a hassle than anything I have ever done with computers including driving multiple projectors for edge blended video mapping.It seems to me this product was launched with a 'get-it-out-the-door!' and well fix it later corporate policy.If one loves endlessly fiddling with computers you'll love it!I could not recommend this product to the average user.

The image is very good. Is it the best? I don't really know. This is my first VR headset. I really like the beaconless tracking. It works very well when the room is lit properly. Controller tracking works 99.9% of the time. And seems to be very responsive. If you have a decent graphics card and computer. This is definitely a good way to start in VR.Now for the bad. The software has problems. It runs well but as long as the headset is plugged in, you'll be draining batteries. Batteries that should last a month or more. Are exhausted in 5 days just sitting on a table. Just because you close the Oculus application does not mean the software is shut down. It's still running the oculus server in the background and that is what keeps the controllers running.Currently you have options of buying games from Oculus and Steam. And in my opinion, going with Steam is your best way to ensure your game investment stays with you. By 2023 all oculus accounts must be merged with a real Facebook account and that doesn't sit well with me. If for some reason you decide to close your Facebook account, and you purchased any games/software from oculus you'll lose your investment.I have intermittently had problems with tracking and the controllers working properly which best was resolved by restarting my machine or shutting down all the pieces of oculus software with the task manager in Windows.Comfort wise the headset is good in my opinion. But I recommend having alternative padding so you can share with a friend without having to wash everything and drying them again.Last difficulty I have is I am far sighted and can barely get things in focus with out my glasses. If you're near sighted you may have to wear your glasses and have difficulty getting the software IPD set right and the distance forward and back is really small.I've run this off a gaming laptop that's a few years old with pretty good success, but you really want it to have good cooling and a decent graphics card to succeed.Pro tip, if you want to play for extended periods without sweating too much into the headset. Put a fan in front of you to help keep you cool. it can also help you keep your sense of direction.It is a great value over all once you are aware of some of the trouble points.Cheers

First time buying a VR headset, and I must say I am completely satisfied! I have tried the previous Rift model couple years ago at a local convention and was amazed with the whole experience. Now that I finally purchased my own Rift S headset during Black Friday, I can experience VR whenever I want!Pros:- Inside-out tracking was the major selling point for me. Not having to worry about setting up external sensors was a big plus. You might experience some blind spots, but nothing major at all.- Easy startup/installation process.- Audio from the hidden built-in speakers is good enough. There is a headphone jack on the left side of the headset just in case.- The face and head padding was comfortable and had no issues with the weight of the headset once I got everything strapped in.- The entire headset can be disassembled including all the foam padding (Use your nails or a card for the forehead and back of the head padding)! This makes life easier when it comes to cleaning them.- Touch controllers feel great and have a nice grip. Throwing and picking up items feels almost real.- Very fun Oculus exclusive games (Robo Recall, Lone Echo, Asgard's Wrath, The Climb, etc).- The best value for the price in the VR market. The Valve Index seems to be the best VR headset right now, but most people will be steered away due to the very steep price.Cons:- No way to physically adjust the IPD (interpupillary distance). You can use the Oculus software to adjust the IPD but it's not quite effective. Although the lenses for the Rift S are fixed at 63.5mm, if you fall between the range of 61.5mm and 65.5mm then you are good to go.- Video Output uses DisplayPort only and not HDMI. Luckily I did my research before I bought this and my NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 has a DisplayPort, so I had no issue there. Still would have preferred HDMI though. (P.S. Ignore the people giving one star reviews regarding Displayport because they did not do their research beforehand. The images above clearly show ""Video Output: DisplayPort 1.2/Mini DisplayPort with adapter included in the box"". Oculus is not at fault here. This is merely user error.)- Not easy to put on and take off the headset if you are wearing glasses.General Notes:- *IMPORTANT* If you are wearing glasses, I highly recommend either purchasing some plastic lens protectors or getting someone you know to 3D print them for you (Standard or Thick size should be good enough). The lenses are the most important part of Rift S and you do not want them to be scratched at all.- Pay attention to the comfort rating for the games. If you are new to VR, start off with comfortable rated games and slowly make your way to moderate and intense rated games. Motion sickness will kick in if you jump to intense rated games right off the bat.- Invest in rechargeable batteries. Believe me it will save you money in the long run.- When cleaning your Rift S headset and controllers, you can use antibacterial wipes as long as they are nonabrasive and does not contain alcohol. I use Lysol Daily Cleansing Wipes and make sure you do not touch the lenses and the sensors. For the lenses and sensors, use a dry optical lens microfiber cloth. Also all three foam padding can be removed and washed with soap and water.- Keep an eye out for VR Cover products for the Rift S as they usually make quality foam replacements.- The Rift S is compatible with SteamVR so you can purchase and play VR games on Steam. If you purchase games on Steam, make sure they support the Oculus SDK. Otherwise you might experience performance issues and other problems with SteamVR. A lot of games on Steam support the Oculus SDK so it should not be a problem.Overall, the Oculus Rift S was definitely the right purchase as my first VR headset and I am having a blast! It is a great time to dive into VR gaming as the games are getting better (Boneworks and upcoming Half Life: Alyx) and technology is improving at a rapid pace. The future is looking bright!

I didnt expect it to be as good as it was, but it was well worth it for a budget headset. Im was new to vr at the time i purchased it and it was quite simple to set up and play, no need to set up any towers to track movement and all around affordable.The main downside of it is the eye distance thing has to be changed by the settings, not mechanically, which i found quite annoying. Otherwise it went way above my expectations*several months later*Issues keep springing up, the method in which the headset contacts my face barely wants to hold up when i make some movements, no necessarily sudden, but just slight movements, which can be quite distracting especially during more intense games. Not only that, the microphone absolutely resists to work, i look at settings and drivers and everything is correct, so it must be a program thing that is not being fixed, and i know im not the only person dealing with this, i found numerous subreddits saying the same problems as i am. not only that, the headset wire casing wasnt completely on the wires on the inside of it, so now it has these unremovable kinks that are incredibly annoying to work with. sadly seems like the only fix i have available to me is buying the $80 cable, so that sucks.

Please save yourselves and but a rift CV1 - it may have more cable but i have never been so damn frustrated in my life and i build gaming PC's for fun.

so not only did they improve on most of the issues on the old headset like text and overal the lag feel of the headset, it doesnt require base stations so its now so mobile with its 1 cord going into the pc display port and one usb 3.0 ""make sure the usb 3.0 is plugged into the back of ur pc, theres a lot of driver issues with front usbs with the sensors on the headset."" Also the nice inclusion of a headphone jack on the headset means you can plug in your own headphones. I like the way it fits with the headstrap, and the cushions are nice, not to much weight either. With its mobility and its improvements its def the headset to get, but i have to say the 90hz to 80hz wasnt a great move and the oled to lcd wasnt great either, but totaly worth it for portability and easiness.

Let me start with the most important thing. For me, only 1 specific USB 3.0 worked (it was hidden on the back marked as VR ready). That USB somehow fixed my display port issues so if you happen to have those then this is an unorthodox way to fix it. This review would be 5 starts if it weren’t for the 6 hour set up I had to do. The quality and experience after that problem on the other hand was AMAZING. The lenses quality is really good and the screen door effect is virtually gone. The headset is very comfortable but make sure to not make it too tight like I did my first time because it will start hurting your forehead. The speakers on the headset are pretty good albeit not the best but, the immersion pretty much makes that problem null. Hand tracking is barely lost even when quickly putting my hands behind the back which is great! The Rift S turned out to be a great buy for a first time VR user like myself and I’d recommend it full heartily.P.S. Buy games on Steam VR instead of the Oculus store for better prices (sometimes) and the possibility of modding games such as Beat Saber.

I am really enjoying this product so far, this is my first VR headset so I don't have any VR headsets to compare this too. But what I can tell you is that as a first time VR buyer, it works pretty well. Of course there have been a few bugs and issues (like all early releases), I bought this pretty recently like a week after it came out so that is to be expected. But overall its a lot of fun, VR games are cheaper but usually a lot shorter than regular PC game, and of course you will need a good PC to run this (especially early access, non optimized games). You probably will need to get a longer cable as the one that comes with it is really bad, in terms of how often it gets tangled and twisted and how short it is. They should have included an extender, preferably a flat one if possible.I would say it's a good buy if you are getting into VR, I was extremely excited when I first got it and for the past week I've been playing nothing but VR games, my friends are probably wondering if I am still alive now.Also a lot of the 1 star reviews are due to people not being able to read. People complaining about it needing a Display port and that their ""VR ready"" laptops dont support it... Just don't be one of those people, it clearly says in the specs what it needs, if you're not willing to read, but are willing to post a long 1 star review about how frustrated you are at the company for not telling you in your face 7 different times that it USES A DISPLAY CABLE, then you shouldn't even have the money to buy this product.

I have a gaming laptop with a USB C slot and an HDMI cable, one would think that DP wouldn't be required but it is. I used up half of my spare money for the last two months to buy one so my girlfriend and I could go hiking in VR since it is getting more difficult to go out for obvious reasons. My laptop doesn't have a displayport plug in which is built into the video card which is ridiculous.Also now facebook accounts are required to use these things, which is flat out privacy invasion and should be stopped. I now have to spend more money buying new computers so my girlfriend and I can go hiking in VR together and tape over all the cameras on this thing, going to be packing lunches to work all next year.

So far so good. I had the controls bug out a few times and not release an in game object when I let go causing a panicked grenade drop at my feet but re-pairing solved this. I suggest using the ""hit oculus button 2 times for pass through"" option as this helps if you need keyboard or mouse access or picking up you controls. I also had to turn the pd all the way up to get it not blurry but I know my pd is less. Few times I got a quick white flicker but that was only on project cars 2 not the other games so I will blame the game. Some screen door effect and good rays but not bad. A wireless dongle like the vive would be perfect. I've played zero caliber and project cars 2 and both are extremely fun. Zero caliber would crash unless I had earbuds connected during loud sounds (would always crash on the 1st shot with a sniper rifle. ) In project cars 2 is where this really shines for me, so immersive, faster lap times, it's great. I would definitely recommend this for the price. If price is no object I'd go with the new valve headset and controllers but this is by far the best bang for the buck vr headset. PS don't blame the oculus for your potato laptop not having a display port.... that's your fault for not doing your homework, it shows DP extensions as an add on item here. Also there is a PD adjustment in the options. It's a software adjustment not an adjustment on the headset itself.

I had been using the Oculus Rift for some time and was getting frustrated with the screen door effect it created. I saw that Oculus had updated to the new Rift S and I noted they had rectified the screen door effect to a better extent. I was excited to try the new system and when it arrived. The packaging is exquisite as they have been. Neatly packed with everything tidy and safe. The new headset no longer requires towers for motion tracking which I thought was a nice cleanup from the horrendous pile of cables I have near my PC.The system is a simple plug and play if you are upgrading from the previous Rift system.Pros:- Screen door effect is practically nonexistent. Games look phenomenal and better than ever.- Less cables = tidier PC space and quick setup.- No need for extra hardware for motion tracking.Cons:- I don't know who was in charge of this decision but they definitely downgraded on the sound quality from the previous headset. The first rift had nice frequencies and bassy responses. This new headset they went away with the speakers and opted for internal speakers on the headband itself so now it just sounds like you have headphones above your ear that completely take away from the immersion. I'm forced to use my PC headsets now to accommodate for the loss of audio quality.- Poor lighting will ruin your tracking. I usually play with my room light off (don't want to disturb roommates) and at night, so I'm reliant on my screen light to keep my tracking in check.- The new controllers are a funky design and I much prefer the feel of the older controllers.Overall, it's basically a 50/50 for me with this. I like the improved visuals, but they really should have kept the sound quality from the previous version and that would have made a 5 star review easier.

In fairness I might find this piece of junk useful if I could set it up. First it forces me to use my Facebook account, then I have to connect the video cable - fine, there's just one small problem, I'm kind of using that for my MONITOR! Then it has to go through some sensor check and keeps telling me that it failed and I have to plug the USB into a different port. I tried FIVE DIFFERENT PORTS! PC front, PC back, on-board, hub, nothing works, and I can't get any support or explanation.If you want to see some far off place, forget Google Earth, just by a first class plane ticket and luxury hotel room, it will be cheaper than getting this pile of useless junk to work.

I really wanted to get a VR headset at some point, but the only thing that was blocking me from having one (except their crazy price range), was the fact that all those headset required the setup of extra sensor around the room, along with dealing with cables running everywhere.Well, not any more now though, with this Oculus Rift S which has only 2 cables to plug in your computer graphic card and USB-3 port, and you are good to go ! This VR headset has all the sensors it needs built in on it, so that's awesome. The only ""catch"" with this (and thus why only 4 stars) is that it start loosing tracking when the room lighting start to get too dark. So it's not possible to use it in the dark for instance, and I always have to be sure to turn on enough lights at night if I want to use it.Other than the low light issue, all worked great with this headset. For info, here are my computer specs:Intel i9700k CPU @3.6ghz, Rog Strix gaming RTX2080 graphic card, Corsair power supply HX850i Platinum, Asus Maximux Formula XI gaming motherboard, Corsair H150i pro water cooling system, Samsung 970 pro NVME M2 drives (where my games are saved). I am using Windows 10 pro.

Bought this product for my kids for Xmas. About 3 weeks after purchase started having connection issues. I work in IT hardware and trouble shooted a lot of minor issues. VR cable with USB/Display port has known issues started a ticket in early April. As of July 14th still no solution. The support group uses a series of instructions to delay the process of admitting a problem. Obviously the company has a huge hardware production issue due to the fact they did not simply swap the unit. After 2 months of back n forth they requested I send the unit back to them before offering any hardware compensation. When the identified problem is clearly solved by sending a new cable back in May, as described by me the customer. That was rejected in favor of the whole unit being sent back but would be accepted as the solution if I could prove it was the cable. Bought a new cable from Amazon to show Facebook they could have resolved this 2 months ago. Finally proving replacing the cable is the solution Oculus support agrees to send a new cable only to never ship the cable. I will update this post once I get the cable to show how long it takes for them to solve an issue. Horrendous service for a product that could revolutionize an a large market.

I think the Oculus could be a really great thing one day, however there are many hardware issues that people tend to just ignore the possibly of. I'll admit that I'm one of those people, and I thought that for a little over $400 I'd be getting decent quality but I was wrong.My mic only works for about 15 minutes before it just unexpectedly shuts off... It really confuses me as I don't know why and how this could even happen but it always does and it really takes away the possibility of playing with friends. I've tried contacting Oculus support about this issue and I've done everything possible to fix this issue but it still happens, even when I plug in an external mic. Another big issue I'm just now experiencing is the game volume gradually getting lower. A day ago a noticed the game volume getting a bit lower, but it wasn't very noticeable.. Now, it's just gotten so low (without me touching or changing ANY settings) that I can't even hear the games I'm playing, don't know if this is an Oculus issue or steam vr issue, but it also takes a way a great deal of fun from a game when you can't even hear it.I would recommend anybody thinking about buying an Oculus to either save up money for a better vr headset like a vive and valve, or just waiting until Oculus can start figuring out fixes for their many different issues. I only listed two big issues but there are MANY more, just smaller and not as bad.

I've chosen this VR because it doesn't need any receivers like Vive do. I didn't really want to drill walls and hang up receivers with wiring for it to work. Oculus requires none of that. It was super easy to set up. Steam picked it right away and connected instantly. Lots of games available. Great quality, and the feeling to be in the game is addictive.The only downside is that it doesn't go to sleep. The screen turns off when headset is removed, but the orange ""light of sleep"" does never come on and blue ""light of awake"" remains, and wile it do the controllers remain working. Controllers consume battery while they are operational.This issue can be mitigated by manually force closing the Oculus service (with task manager, each time after using the VR).

What is annoying that many people are giving low ratings because they were not competent enough to know that this VR headset only uses display port. Many of these reviewers are trying to use this on their ""gaming"" laptops knowing well it only has one output = hdmi.Besides the idiocracy of many of these people the headset is excellent, the oculus guardian is an awesome feature, allows you to ""fence"" around you to ensure that you wont hit anything like furniture or a wall. The best part is that if you step outside of your ""fence"" the cameras turn on the headset allowing you to see your room or wherever you are, so you don't have to constantly take out your headset to get oriented again, very nice feature.The resolution is nice and clear and the IPD is software but the sweet spot seems to be a lot better than the previous rift and the dell VR headset I had (which had a very tiny sweet spot for clear images).Excellent headset, very well worth the money, ignore the negative reviews of no support for hdmi, its in the spec list that this is display port only. Many people are sour because they were too stupid to not read the spec list for this before buying.

Last year 12/2018, I was very disappointed by the Quest. It didn't seem to have a very good library, and was not Steam enabled. Using Steams website, I was able to see what I needed and get my computer VR ready. Set up Rift S through Oculus and checked out their library. Then downloaded and set up SteamVR. Using Rift S, I'm able to use and list the SteamVR games. Did some testing of various games, I love the Oculus tutorials. It works great! Very Satisfied

I bought this item for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift. Not only are there pieces missing but it is all scuffed up and will not work. It doesn’t read on his computer or turn on. We have bought another one that was used and it works perfectly and it is high quality, no scuffs and scratches. I’m very disappointed in the quality of this item. This item should not have been sold for $300 (actually not at all) since it is damaged. I don’t normally write reviews and I typically take the loss when something I buy online don’t work out, but this was expensive and it was the “big gift” that my boyfriend really wanted. It has been extremely frustrating when he was so excited for this gift to not even be able to use it because of missing pieces. After we had to go and buy the pieces needed it still will not work. No seller should sell something that is damaged and missing pieces. Period. If I would have known that this would have been this bad I would not have bought it. I understand the repercussions of buying something used but if you as a seller don’t take good quality care of the electronic then you should not be selling it later down the line. I wasted $300 on a product that doesn’t even work and is all scuffed and scratched up. If you choose to buy this item just save up and get a new one because the risk of spending this much on a used one for it to be in such bad shape and quality is not worth it in my opinion.

1. Software will not install if you have dynamic disk in Windows. All other software will, but not software from Oculus. Converting from dynamic disk to basic requires either paid software or cannot be done without data loss. I had to do that, only to hit problem number two.2. Even if you have display port on your laptop, this display port must be connected directly to GPU, that is not the case with many laptops. So, you're out of luck here. Older HDMI model had no problems with that.I had to return it and find older Rift model. If I upgrade I will buy quest, but not Rift S.

I spent more time trouble shooting the product than actually using it. After 10(ish) hours of constantly trying to get it to work (flashing screens, random audio noises, driver issues, USB issues, motion tracking issues), I sent it back. Oculus' help center is pathetic and they are resistant to allow users that return systems to return games. Terrible product. Couldn't have been a worse experience.

I just want to leave this comment here regarding my experience with the Oculus Rift S headset. It malfunctioned and froze causing my aunt to lose her balance. She fell into the entertainment center which broke her nose and split her cheek open. She then fell over onto my dog who then was startled and bit her in the face causing severe damage to her upper lip and eye brow. 12 stitches later, and still requires plastic surgery. All of this happened on Christmas Day, and it sure is a Christmas to remember. After spending over an hour cleaning up blood stains, and after an 8 hour night my family spent in the hospital with my aunt, this morning Animal Control took my dog into custody and euthanized him.. My dog, my baby, of 5 years is gone.. My mans best friend is gone due to this piece of equipment and I will never forget this day. I do not expect that anybody can help, nor do I expect compensation. I just would like somebody in the sales department or ANYBODY who works for amazon to review this and understand that this headset has issues.. Issues that can even cause a loss of life or loss of a loved one. I lost my dog Ty, my aunt needs plastic surgery to fix her lip and nose, and I pray to god that my 6 month old daughter never remembers this moment that occurred on her very first Christmas.

Bought the Oculus Rift S after months and months of waiting and contemplating. I've had the PSVR before and it made me sick everytime due to the screen door and lack of high quality screen so i was hesitant but the reviews all suggested I shouldnt have that problem anymore. A few more months passed as I was waiting for the Rift S to be in stock and finally it came.I was let down. This particular headset just doesn't perform as I thought it would. It doesnt perform at all really. I didnt notice as much ""screen door"" effect on the visuals but all of the visuals were blurry. There's a very small area that comes in somewhat clear, with hours of struggling to find, but even that isn't enough to make it blow me away like I thought it would. I actually think the PSVR is better overall.The blurry visuals made me sick within fifteen minutes. They removed mechanical adjustment and went with software adjustment for the ipd. I tried all the different settings and none of them made any difference to the graphics or texts. It's a strain to try and read anything or focus. Complete letdown. I thought maybe I'll keep giving it a try and get my ""VR legs"".Nope. Even after two weeks of playing for hours on end, it never did get better. I feel it became worse. I'd get sick even faster and text became increasingly hard to read. This isnt even the worse part.The headset would crash and lose all tracking of the controllers, along with the passthrough function. Playing something as simple as PokerStarsVR is impossible without controller tracking. This is a known issue and yet they still sell more headsets. I didnt find out it was a huge issue until I was looking for answers regarding this problem. Thid problem seemed to be temporarily fixed with a power cycle of the PC but after a while it happened more and more. I spent more time trying to get back into the games and fix this issue than I did playing. Total waste of time.I dont even want to talk about how flimsy it feels. I cant imagine it lasting more than a year without incredible attention to the safety of the headset which pulls you right out of the immersion of the VR headset. The sole purpose of the headset is immersion.I cant speak for other headsets but the Rift S in the current state it's in, is not worth anymore than 100 dollars. Personally I wouldn't even buy it then because it makes me sick. Please save your money and wait for headsets in the future to come out that are of better quality and design.

This has been an adventure. The first few days it just didn't work. After updating Windows, Driver, and Firmware a dozen times I was finally able to play.There are still alot of issues. The screen will often flash static for a frame or two. The hand controllers will randomly get stuck in position from time to time. Also, oculus software doesn't recognize my processor so I have a constant ""Your PC doesn't fit the minimum requirements"" alert.

Bought this a few months ago, and while I haven't had any major issues with it, I figured I'd write an honest review of my experience with it so far.Right off the bat, super aesthetically-pleasing design. Smooth lines, quality plastic and good overall design. Hooking it up was, for the most part, a breeze (had an issue with Oculus program, had to restart PC).Pros:-Good/solid design-Works very well-Screen very clear-Tracking is accurate-Good storage box for when not in use-Cables are very sturdy, can't foresee them ripping in futureCons:-After trying out a few games, there has been a laggy (and extremely disorienting) experience in some of the games. Not sure if this is hardware or software related.-It'd be much nicer if the controllers were charge controllers. They currently require AA batterys.-My friend bought one new straight from Oculus, and it only worked for a few days. He's had it for months now, trying to contact them and he said he has had no messages back from them, so he currently has  a $500 headset he bought brand new that won't work sitting in his room.

Finally you don't need those dumb sensors which take up the majority of your USB slots, along with the constant issues with the 3 sensor setups. This no longer requires sensors, as they're built into the headset itself, on top of that, the image is more clearer than the Rift, which is also better. I know some might say this isn't a ""step up"" or an ""upgrade"", but it really is?Literally those sensors were the biggest pain in the ass I've ever dealt with, whether it was constant disconnecting for no reason, or ""this is the wrong USB type"", despite that I had used the same usb slots in the past. That, and running a 3 sensor setup wouldn't work as you think it would.Every sensor with the original Rift had to be a pain, had to be in specific slots in order for it to work, and I only got it to work once, and that was when I brought my PC downstairs for more room to play in. Didn't work anymore after that.Get the Rift S if you still own an original Rift, and hate having sensors, it's a serious upgrade from it, way better than it was before.

My build for comparison:  i9 9900k paired with a 1080tiFor the fastest response time possible programs are on a m.2 nvme drive and all games are saved on a ssd.This is my first time purchasing a vr headset. I did my researched visually but never got a hold of any other device so I can not compare it to anything else.What I can tell is the Rift S is just too awesome. From the introduction set up to playing and testing the guardian limits. I love this thing.Was it worth $400? Honestly I'm just going to say yes. Could it be cheaper? no not really (but it may later anyways) Why? I did not have to set up anything beside connecting the usb and display port cables. The head harness is comfy, tracking is literally perfect and I'm having a blast playing and exploring.Really major cons are the mic and speakers. The mic can be fixed by disabling windows mic boost and lowering the volume. The speakers I would have to tinker with but they are a 4/10 sound. Pretty bad but I just use my arctis 7 wireless headphones that fit just fine.The controllers are pretty neat I make sure to use the included straps or else a Wii remote accident will ensue. I can not believe how is easy it was to use to the controllers layout. It just suddenly felt natural after a few hours.Steam Vr works perfectly along side the Oculus program with no issues. The interface with both is just too awesome to play around with including using the virtual desktop.I hope anyone considers my review. But with no set up of Satellites like the older model and the Rift S being all in one package the headset is to good to pass up.** Just going to add delivery from Amazon was crazy fast. I got informed it would arrive Tuesday though I ordered it the last Friday.  Just a few hours later I got an update that it would arrive on Sunday. Thanks Amazon! Guess I got lucky since at this moment in time estimates on shipping are 1 week now.

Four or five months in it sounded like the speakers blew. Contacted oculus because it is supposed to be under warranty for a year. They told us to do this and that. We did. Still didn’t work. They stopped communication on both my son and I. After researching we figured it out it was the cord, which was suppose to be under warranty and this is a common problem. Wire is not even easy to get. Cost me 115 from some seller on amazon and guess what.... System works again. Absolutely horrible customer service and they don’t back their own warranty. Spend extra and get the HTC VR. Will be cheaper in the long run replacing that wire.

This is a very hit or miss bit of technology.  I know that it's fairly new and all but come on!  About 3 times out of 4, it is the most amazing thing I've ever owned.  It will transport you to another world.  The problem is the 25% of the time that it seems to struggle to just start up.  You fire up the Oculus software and put on the Rift S; it's supposed to start up pretty quickly.  When it struggles, it will keep saying that it needs to restart the software or that it can't find the device or that it isn't plugged in!  This is VERY frustrating and searches on line reveal that it's a BIG problem.  Interestingly, I never see any postings, suggestions or fixes from Oculus.  If I was in the return period, i'd be very close to boxing it up and sending it back.  I love this thing and I want to love this thing but it's one of the most amateur, bush league devices that I've ever owned.  Buy with LOTS of patience...

This technology is still very much fledgling and full of all of the early adaptor pitfalls that befall early adopters.It does not connect to your computer easily.  It does not interpret your material space well.  Its visual output is off-putting.  It does not do any of the jobs that are required to be a product particularly well.  I do not know why configs and re-initializations, etc, that I tried ""fixed"" its fundamental problems didn't for me, but I do know that I have set it up about 5 times and each time ate up about 1.5-4 hours of my life.  And each time more than the previous one told me ""this product is not ready for prime time.""If you're willing to put in the work to get something out of it there's surely something there.  But it's quite unfortunately difficult to do so.

For the first few days the headset is fun to use and has minimal issues. Controllers were a little iffy because moving around too much causes the batteries to briefly deseat from the springs, which means that your hand tracking in VR is temporarily de-calibrated.After about two weeks of periodic use, the headset itself began to lose hand tracking entirely, not just temporarily. Enabling VR Passthrough usually lets you see through the headset's cameras, but would instead display a TV static like effect, completely rendering you blind with these goggles on. Upon further research, a myriad of fixes both worked for some and did not work for others, so I just cut my losses and decided to return the headset. I do not plan on getting another one.For the games that I played, it was fine after I tried some controller fixes. Blade and Sorcery was fun, same with Superhot VR, VRChat, whatever. Those were fine! The games themselves played as intended. It's the hardware that's crap. Do not buy this headset. I cannot recommend anything else, but I can tell you not to but this headset. It is a piece of garbage.

This was my first VR headset ever - I never wanted to get any of the early generations because I didn't want to set up the little sensor stations around my room and have more cords to trip over. The Rift S allows you to draw a space which will be remembered by the cameras and is super convenient. Occasionally it ""forgets"" the space and I have to set it up again, but it only takes a minute and is not a hassle.I will mention some of the cons, however:- You cannot look directly at the ground or the position of the headset will be set in such a way that everything is blurry and it will feel like it's about to fall off your head. I have a friend with an HTC Vive who said he also has this happen, so I'm assuming it's just a kink that hasn't been worked out in all VR headsets. So far the fix has just been to push down and hold the VR set with one hand if you ever need to look down, which is a slight inconvenience, but has not impacted my fun in a major way yet.- Occasionally the controllers glitch/bug out and just become totally desynced for a few microseconds. It's a little annoying when it happens in a game like Beat Saber, but again, it hasn't happened often enough to make me very upset yet. I'm assuming updates can repair these bugs in the future.- When I'm using the controllers, sometimes it's really easy with regular use for the battery shields to come out, especially in a game where you are gripping and moving a lot - it's a little annoying to push the battery shields back into place but thankfully this is another problem that has not been significantly annoying yet.- Occasionally the software will crash my computer if I leave the headset plugged in for long periods of time without using it - I've just been unplugging the USB cable when I'm not using it and that prevents the crashing. Hopefully this issue will be resolved in a future update so I can just leave it plugged in 24/7 and decrease the wear-and-tear on the USB cable.I also have some specific pros to mention as well:- The feature that allows you to view the real world when you step out of the boundary is incredibly useful - it's easy for me to hydrate because I can spot my water and just drink from it really easily with no hassle. It's not like looking through a phone camera though - it's pretty blobby and you can only make out large shapes in black and white color only, so you won't be checking your phone, but you can manipulate basic objects (like a drink of water).- As mentioned before, it is super convenient because there are no stationary sensors - the cameras do all the work.- Runs well with my 1080 Ti even while I'm running 4K settings on my monitor.- Comfortable one-size-fits-all adjustable headset design -- very easy to adjust when I had a Beat Saber VR party with 5 other people.- Compatibility with SteamVR in addition to the Oculus platform.- High quality graphics that makes the experiences even more believable.- The Oculus Store is very user-friendly and is the first Steam-like ""Gaming Program Platform"" that I don't mind using. I've never liked Origin's or Ubisoft's user interface.

started off pretty good - i had to unplug and replug the USB and video ports each time in order to get it to work. few months later there was a software update and i no longer had to plug and unplug - then i updated the software in October and it stopped working - have been working with Oculus support for almost 2 months now - went as far as reloading my whole OS, even added a new USB3 PCIe card yet nothing has fixed it - Oculus support keeps asking me to uninstall different things and asking me to try it on a different computer (which i do not have) - I keep asking Oculus to replace this headset that is still under the 1 year warranty but they keep coming up with other things to uninstall  - dont waste your time or money on this - stay away from Oculus

Fantastic experience for what's supposed to be the cheap option. Never tried vr before, but got competely lost in half life alyx.I did have the disconnect issue where my USB 3.0 would randomly disconnect during play. Spent a day just reseting every half hour. But today I used another 3.0 port, and fastened the cable in a way where it wouldn't be bending out of the port. Just played for 6 hours with no issues.Will edit if I have similar planned obsolescence issues that other reviews have mentioned, but right now everything works as advertised

Facebook has no loyalty or ethics. Like many the robbed me and countless others who was foolish to purchase the Rift S. The truth of the matter is Facebook, owner of the Oculus brand intentionally tanked thousands of headsets with a driver update. The refused to correct this issue because they being a social media enterprise more or less decided to pool their resources and focus only on the bread winners or fat cows the award winning Quest brand product line and let the low lying dogs the Oculus Rift S line die. I understand the needs of the business however, it is unethical to rob and cheat a paying customer in order to increase there bottom line. If you want to discontinue the product line, that is your right. But you give the customer what he or she paid for. Oculus less than a year old and is worthless now. Buyer beware, if they can do thousands of paying customers this way they more than likely will do this to you Quest 2 owners. Don't trust them! I suggest you spend your hard earn money with a company that actually cares about the future of VR and its users. Do yourself a favor and before purchasing anything from Facebook do a search for Oculus Rift update displayport not recognized by computer. Or Oculus Rift broken or something along those lines, see for yourself. I just purchased a HTC Vive VR System from a real tech company. I would not buy another Oculus product even if they went on sale for a dollar! Keep it!!!!

I bought this headset a little over a year ago, and had nothing but great experiences with it. It's comfortable, setup is a breeze, and it looks quite good.Then it all got ruined by Facebook. Facebook acquired Oculus a while ago, and I wasn't too concerned about it because I thought Oculus would by-and-large stay pretty independent from Facebook. Boy was I wrong. Oculus accounts are now being replaced with Facebook accounts, and after 2023, you won't even be able to use your Oculus account anymore. I wouldn't be mad about this if Facebook wasn't so horribly intrusive. I've tried having a Facebook account before, but the endless notifications from family members trying to friend you and poke you and tag you in photos are absolutely infuriating. I would return this headset if I could and save up for an HP Reverb G2 instead. Don't buy a Rift S unless you want to be forced to make a Facebook account.

After 3 months of trying to get this piece of garbage to work properly, I have given up. I've dealt with oculus support for 2 months trying to resolve an issue that was causing weapons to lag in my hand when using 2 hands. After they had me send in my current headset which was not defective in any way to try to ""fix"" the issue, they sent me one with a broken halo band. After that I had to wait another week for my replacement band to come in. I eventually bought a new processor and found that was the fix I needed. No more issues. Not sure why they couldn't come up with that solution after having me send them my logs a million times.A week later, my device is once again unusable. After 5 minutes of gameplay, the controllers lose tracking and I have to restart the whole headset entirely. Every. Time. So, I'm done with this piece of junk. I should have known buying from a company now run by Facebook would end up this way.My honest review, save your money for when VR is more reliable. The index is a pocket burning $1000, and basically your only other option is a cheaply made headset with a million little issues, and new ones constantly being added due to their updates. What a horrible experience. Now, to sell it or request a refund.

Has only worked intermittently since we bought it.  Constantly get an error saying a restart is required, which we do and it just tells us we need to restart again in an endless loop.  Have uninstalled and reinstalled, moved to different USB ports, bought a powered USB hub, etc, etc.  Complete piece of junk and a waste of money.  We were going to return it, but many online comments say they just send you a refurbished item to replace it.  Supposedly Oculus/Facebook/whoever owns this company now is ""working on the issues as quickly as possible"", but we've had this thing since Christmas and it's now almost March.Maybe they will eventually fix the issues they are having, but it certainly doesn't excuse the FACT that they released a product that wasn't ready for market.I'm feeling like an idiot for not just demanding my money back.

When it works, it's a total blast -- even just playing around in the Oculus Home is fascinating. Of course that's IF you can get it working. From reading I've done, it seems a lot of computers can't consistently provide adequate power to the headset. And instead of this issue manifesting in a clear and easy to understand manner (like a dialog warning of such), it manifests in random glitches such as the tracking cameras failing (controllers still register orientation and button presses, but appear glued to your side, and passthrough view only shows static/snow). Correcting this usually requires restarting the computer, and/or removing and re-setting-up the headset. The consequence is you spend more time in setup than you do playing. If the headset requires more power, it would've made sense to just have it's own power supply rather than HOPE a user's computer can handle it.

well let's start with the conscons- lens scratches really easily so keep a microfiber cloth and DON'T RUB IT HARD.- there's an issue that every now and then the ingame ""hands"" just gets stuck so you have to completely remove the cables and restart the game and everything.- the foam isn't removable.- the 8 hrz isn't bad but I still wish they could've stuck to 90 hrz.- playing beat saber on expert+ the little magnetic battery cover came off so  I recommend getting an Anti-Throw Handle Protective Sleeve.pros- the games are really fun and in general it works really well.- the cameras are spot on (when they work, former issue I mentioned)- at least for me its quite comfy, it doesn't leave that noticeable mark on you hear when you wear something too tight.- the controllers battery last for a week or so.- the controllers are ridiculously light.- the resolution is pretty good.- you can buy and customize a fair amount of the headset itself which is kind of fun but expensive.I guess the next one will fix all the current problems.

Little note first: Immediately after launch there are a number of firmware issues that need to be patched and issues to get sorted, as well there are many people not paying attention and ordering something they can't use(the S uses a Displayport connector which is NOT HMDI, which they clearly mark in packaging). Any review complaining about this fact should be ignored for not knowing what they were buying.The Rift S is absolutely phenomenal. For it's few faults I can't justify taking off any stars for the experience it gives.The SDE is virtually gone in most situations. The amount of people who were up in arms over them going ""backwards"" from OLEDs to LCD screens will now have to eat crow given how great the quality is and how incredibly sharp things are for the resolution the S shows compared to previous models.The lack of need for sensors is the other huge factor in why I bought in now. Not having a ton of stuff to set up and move around and worry about if I want to expand or shift my play area is great, and the tracking works exceptionally well(in most cases, if you have a menu on one hand and select with the other, the rings can occlude and make the menu hand go a bit wonky like in Quill), but in most cases it doesn't become an issue and I assume they'll patch up the firmware to give us a fix for this in some way.The audio gets complaints because ""not enough bass"" but you can plug in a pair of earbuds and get good bass(my normal earbuds do it very well), headphones can be a pain to use in conjunction with the halo strap but honestly even in Beat Saber I haven't felt upset about the audio of the default speakers, and it's a pretty nice implementation on a technical level.My IPD is slightly greater than their ""recommended range"", but even at 67.5 everything looks great, and the software setting's numbers do go well beyond the ideal range they state. Though I do see posts about people with near-70 IPDs and low-60s IPDs having to return them, so be careful about that.I can't think of any specifics other than wow are my arms and legs exhausted after two days of standing and waving my arms way more than I have in a while. If you're considering jumping into VR the price is great(I was so onboard for index because of those controllers but man... 1k was way outside my price range). the visuals are great, and all you have is one cord tying you to your PC(and of course the bounds of your space).Don't let the angry normies who don't understand the stuff they're buying fool you with the 1-star reviews, if you don't already have a headset but you have a mid-high end gaming PC from the last few years(or longer, I only have a 980, built this baby near-on 10 years ago) I'd say this is where to jump into VR.

So initially I was having a hard time convincing myself that an upgrade to the Rift S wasn't worth it. But my curiousness pulled the trigger.And WOW.The screen door effect is practically non existent, the clarity of the screen is SO much better, I can read further than the other rift as well. And the no sensors? That's icing on the cake. Never having to worry about messing with the cables and sensors again make this upgrade worth it alone.When I first started using the headset, there was some slight stuttering while moving my head, turns out the UBS 3.1 slot I was using was not sufficient, I moved it to a new USB 3.1 slot and it was perfect.The only complaint as of now is that there is a random white/static flicker that lasts under a second. I looked it up and it seems that this is a widespread problem that Oculus claims they're working on at the moment and I imagine it will be fixed sooner rather than later.The sound is also not the greatest, it comes from speakers that are implanted into the halo ring right above your ear. It can and will be heard by everyone else in the room, which is nice if you are playing a game and want others to be able to hear what is going on, but also not nice when someone doesn't want to hear all of your audio. Luckily they implemented an auxiliary jack in the halo, I just recently purchased a nice pair of earbuds that I will believe compliment the headset well.So if you're on the fence about upgrading from the Rift CV1, if you have the money, go for it, you won't be disappointed. And if you're contemplating buying your first VR headset, the setup is simple, and you will have a blast.

Ironically, the rift s is the opposite of what is set out to be in my opinion, hence why I believe it is a dangerous product for average consumers. the ""s"" in rift s stands for simple (I think) and sadly, there is nothing simple under the surface of this headset. The attractive thing about this headset is the no external cameras, instead, inside out tracking. which in my opinion works great and there is no issue with this. sadly for the rift s, there are many other issues plaguing it, the most glaring one, power delivery issues. if you have a prebuilt gaming pc and not much knowledge in components, I say skip the buy on this one, or vr as a whole. pre-built gaming pc manufacturers often cheap out on motherboards and power supply's, which is the two choking points when using this device. a cheap mother board in the desktop experience, may hinder upgradeability should not effect in game performance, same as a cheap power supply, which is why its a tempting spot to cut corners for manufactures. anyway, you may be wondering why this matters. well, it can result in crashes, necessary workarounds, and in some cases complete non functionality. I have these issues first hand. the workaround that is NESSECARY for me to even make it into a game is to plug the usb connector into my front panel which makes a ugly and awkward split on the side of my case, half the cable going into a front panel port, half the cable going into the back of my motherboard. even in this case (see in above picture), power is still insufficient and any game with shooting mechanics simply bugs out my hands when I shoot. I was extremely upset when I downloaded PAVLOV VR and every time I shot a weapon, my vr hands went flying into space. I even gave oculus the benefit of doubt and ordered a replacement, sadly, no change. I have a A320M ASRock motherboard, in the off chance you have the same one, it will not work with this board, without numerous compromises and workarounds. I would imagine if your motherboard is 120 American dollars or more, it will probably work.

Rift S requires that if there is no DisplayPort plug (uncommon on laptops) that the USB-C adapter be wired to the discrete graphics card directly. My GTX 1060 Graphics card normally appears connected directly to the HDMI port, but when the Rift S is installed it can only connect the USB-C ports (required for the Rift S) through the integrated graphics card. Ultimately this means that unless your laptop has a DisplayPort connection on board, or is one of 3 current (EXPENSIVE) Oculus approved laptops, it cannot work with the Rift S. No where in the technical specs does it mention this hardware limitation, and I attempted overcoming this with a computer engineer, two Rift S's, another desktop PC which could connect it, and my old Oculus Rift CV1. It cannot be done even with the latest GeForce Game Ready drivers. I use a Dell Inspiron 7577, which is more than capable of running the original Oculus Rift CV1 with 3 sensors. I find the lack of describing this unique hardware limitation to be irresponsible, and Oculus support actually tried suggesting I just buy one of the three available $2000 Rift S recommended laptops as a solution.

After searching Oculus's forum I found that the common consensus was that there was an issue with the internal camera for the Ocuslus S which caused a bug where the controllers would stop tracking and would only be able to rotate. You would have to restart/unplug then re-plug occulus to get it to work again. This wouldn't work every time either, so you would have to do it multiple times sometimes. No answer was given by Oculus besides maybe a firmware update could help with it, it did not. Some speculated that the bandwidth of the USB inputs could cause the issue because the tracking hardware didn't have enough power. The suggestion was to unplug all other usb devices from your computer or purchase a peripheral device for the oculus. This was also not guaranteed.I cannot condone anyone to purchase this product. Really frustrating when you spend $400 and spend more time researching issues and troubleshooting than playing. Bad experience, I will most likely just save up for the Vive.

Cons: Seems like Oculus is giving the Quest the most support and updates but that's OK really. This has a one wire tether to your PC. You need to have an open display port on your video card to plug this into and most laptops do not have one, hard to find a Male HDMI to female display port adapter. The cord could be a little longer.Pros: The video quality is much better than I thought it would be. I have been playing Destiny 2 on my Xbox One X and streaming the play to my Rift S and it works well almost no input lag even PvP is doable. Being able to use alternative software and video sources outside the Oculus store is really nice and Steam deals always seem to beat the Oculus store. The Quest and Go have to use the Oculus store. Not having to set up trackers is really nice and makes the experience flow better. Purchased during Cyber Monday so it was 50.00 off the regular price.

I’ll add a 4-star review for the RIFT S after using for a couple weeks.  I debated giving it a 3 for a couple reasons but buying a piece of tech like this is such a complex discussion!Bottom line: this is a significant step up from the Rift CV1 in many dimensions: comfort, clarity, and ease of use.  The much derided sound down-grade is easily rectified with some simple mods.Background: Previous Rift CV1 owner – also own the new Quest.  IPD is fairly narrow – my smartphone says it’s 62mm, but I think it’s more like 60mm.  My eyes are deeper set, and my hat size is 7-5/8ths.Pros:+ Significant comfort upgrade over the Rift CV1 – not a fan of the goggle design from the previous Rift, I think the halo design is vastly better++ Bonus points for how easy it is to share this headset with friends and family with the quick adjust knob+ God-rays are significantly reduced – that was a horrible first impression on the Rift CV1+ Wider sweet spot, clearer lens overall+ Significantly sharper image+ Inside out tracking is much easier to setup++++++ Passthrough plus, and setting up a guardian is such a user-friendly experience that cannot be underestimatedCons:- Audio is crap, easy to mod though (Koss Porta Pro and some 3d printed mounts)- Controllers feel like a step back in quality- THE CABLE has got to be the thickest most annoying cable they could have found to use in VR- Where did my OLED blacks go?!?!?- The controlling tracking feels less jittery than the Rift CV1, but does have more blind spots to deal with (where it will lose your hands until they come back into view)Overall – I would pick the Rift S over the Rift CV1 because I personally find the halo design vastly more comfortable to wear for extended periods and that matters most.  Passthrough PLUS and the guardian setup was an incredible pleasure to use.  Having just setup my Rift CV1 in a new space in Feb, the setup was a frustration filled nuisance of epic proportions – I could never get my rear sensor placement right.The garbage built in headphones are easy enough to rectify with less than 50 bucks in mods (Koss Porta Pro and some 3d printed mounts) (could go even cheaper buying Koss Porta Pro speakers off AliExpress and some light soldering skills).  So my main star reduction comes from the cable itself – which is in serious need of design overhaul.  The lack of OLED blacks isn't great compared to my Quest headset, but the up-tick in clarity and sharpness is worth it, and at least my gray black screen is uniform without any back-light bleed to speak of.  I do find that for any movie/video/media consumption I would rather wear the quest - the colors pop, and blacks look much better.I can see why veterans are somewhat review bombing this, but I was able to pick up Rift S and Quest for less than the price of the Valve Index package!  That said, I still spent about as much as the Valve Index, so perhaps my value assessment isn't perfect.  I think Oculus is really solid on their marketing jargon for this headset – this is the headset for the newcomer to the VR space.  For those that finally got their sensors placed and USB port bandwidth issues solved, and all the other intricacies of their old system settled, then it’s not going to be a fundamental shift.  I found the old headset uncomfortable and I had to constantly wiggle it to get my eyes back into the sweet spot.  On top of that, the initial Rift CV1 setup was an atrocity – even with their excellent software.  The Rift S is truly the best design for me.

I use my VR mostly for simulator games especially flight sims like DCS, IL-2 BoS, Cliffs of Dover, RoF, Tank Crew,Flying Circus, and Elite Dangerous.I researched many hours before I purchased and I read many times about how it's impossible to really know what VR is like until you try it. Let me tell you those words are true! VR is like no other experience in gaming it takes a little tweaking to get your VR set up and running but once you got your settings it's done.I also purchased the RiftS because I use VR only on PC and the RiftS is the most bang for the bucks in a very affordable price range for PC gaming and no crazy wires all over the place from sensors.I can actually just put the VR set on and play either sitting or standing depending on the game. The clarity and performance of the RiftS is excellent and I can actually read the gauges in the cockpit.

First off, I had the Oculus Rift CV1.  It is an awesome machine.  I enjoyed it immensely, and if I had done my homework right, I would still have it now.  I made the mistake of selling it before I received the new Oculus Rift S.  I did not hesitate due to the fact the Rift S is supposed to be an amazing upgrade, which is MOSTLY true.  HOWEVER, and a HUGE HOWEVER, there's a thing called IPD.  Now, even with the original Rift, I paid no attention to IPD.  You could manually adjust it with a slider and move the mask into position and no sweat.  Great FOV, great clarity.Jump to the Rift S and you are unable to make this manual adjustment.  For some reason, and I did not even realize this until I had already ordered it, Oculus decided to fix it at 63.5 mm IPD.  Yet, Oculus states you can adjust anywhere from 58mm to 72mm inside VR using their software settings.  Great, no worries, right?  Nope, not even close.  I spent 2 days trying to find the ""sweet spot"" adjusting the headset to my face and using their software adustment.  I did find I could still use it and not kill myself with headaches and eye strain after squeezing the set as hard to my face as possible, BUT there is a HUGE trade-off.  Your Field of View is SEVERELY reduced while the corners of your view remain blurry.  From Oculus CV1 to Rift S, I feel like I'm looking through a paper towel tube.To sum it up.  Do your homework, unlike me.  Know your IPD.  If you are in the 68-70mm range like myself, this is NOT WORTH IT.  It is very possible to still use this device AND the visuals in the small sweet spot you find is slightly improved, but your FOV is SEVERELY REDUCED to the point that you will be constantly moving your head side to side just to see the same view you would have had in the Rift CV1.  For this money, you should not have to settle for something that is intentionally designed for people with a smaller sized face in mind.I am returning my Rift S.

At the time I had it, my experience was plagued by some controller recognition issues where the controllers would spaz out making things unplayable and necessitating a restart. While the screen was a little brighter compared to the OG Rift, it was pretty clear that the framerate was a little lower and it didn't feel especially premium. But for me, the biggest issue was the controller bug (which is common or was as of early July, 2019) and the headset strap, which is bulky and unfriendly for those who wanted to wear over-the-ear headphones with it.  In fact, you can't wear your big, nice headphones with this at all. Something I can do with my Vive Pro, Valve Index, Quest and original Rift.For me, it was a only a few pros and a bunch of cons. Hopefully the controller detection issues are (or have been) resolved, but I probably won't be getting another Oculus VR headset until their next generation Rift headset comes out and is demonstrably better than what they've already made.

TLDR: Run from this product.My PC well exceeds the ""recommended"" specs... I had just spent $1,200 upgrading it specifically for VR use in mind. Oculus Rift S arrived and I go to hook it up, their oculus.exe sees my USB 3 connected but will not register the display port as being connected. Both Windows and my Radeon graphics card can see the device connected as a display but the oculus.exe cannot. Sound comes out and the status lights show as they should but the headset is pitch black inside. I've contacted Oculus support staff with my issue and followed all their recommendations but not only has my oculus problem not been resolved, but I am now having problems with other things due to following the steps they provided to fix my VR headset.What did FaceBonk do to this once awesome platform? it's tragic.

I kept having problems with the controllers losing tracking. Sometimes i couldn't play for 5 min at a time without this problem. I would have either reboot my pc or unplug the usb and plug it back in. I tried the windows usb power settings and adding more light in my room. Nothing worked. I did request a replacement and was sent one right away but i was having the same problem. I read somewhere of someone using an externally powered usb 3.0 hub to solve this so i tried it. I haven't had a single problem with this product ever since I used the external usb hub. Controllers would freeze up, sometimes the screen would go static or turn black. None of those problems came back.  Im giving it 4 stars because the IPD can't be adjusted at the lens. My right eye in this gets blurry unless i position the headset kind of crooked on my face. It's kind of annoying. Adjusting the IPD in the software seems to do nothing.  Other than that this thing is a lot of fun.

Yes part of this is me getting intoned to this product but this is why I gave it only 4 star. The Oculus Riff S loaded fine It gave me things to play with to practice with the controllers and then placed me on a platform that dose nothing and I cant move in it. So far trying to find answers are nebulous right now. I'd of hope like others to be more intuitive (plug & play). Also I have two Apps Flying Sim's X-plane and Prepare v4 neither them or Oculus really address the interface with each other. You tube, they all show the set up witch is Load SW. YouTube never shows what they did to get them working to gather Dose it work with a mouse , keyboard the Oculus controllers these Company's claim to be built for each other. You just have to look out in the web of users(which I will). It just doesn't need to be so dismissed.4 star at best right now. If any one can fill in the blanks would be so helpful. Greg

I left my first oculus where it got sun damaged. Before purchasing the S I read many reviews about its flaws and was hesitant to buy this one over the original. I’m so glad I did. First of all the pass through feature is so great. When you get close to out of bounds the cameras kick on and you can see what your about to run into. I’m really looking forward to augmented reality with this feature. The resolution is much higher. The halo style head gear is far superior. I have had no ‘static’ or black screens like I keep reading about. The only thing I could see being an issue is the eye spacing. To be honest I never really saw a difference on the older model when I changed it and I see zero difference on this one. I can however see in the edge of my vision a double overlay that wasn’t there before. Really it’s barley noticeable especially when playing a game. Over all I’m very happy with this model and not dealing with those sensors makes it worth the $ alone. BUT I CANT STRESS ENOUGH, NEVER LEAVE IT IN THE SUN!!!

The oculus has not been able to hook up to my new pc from cyberpc.  It says not connected to the display port.  I have trouble shot with oculus and it is still doing the same thing.  I think I need a new cable coming from the oculus buy I am not sure.  The pc settings say all is working correctly.  I have been emailing the support team from Oculus and this is where I am at.  Just want it to work so we can play!!  I have been dealing with Oculus support for 3 months now and the headset still doesn't work.  I have asked for address to send to them to look at it, still nothing. I would not recommend this product!  Dozens of emails and still no solution to my issue!  I wish I could get my $$$ back!

This is an amazing device. The quality and clarity is beyond anything I've ever experienced. It was extremely difficult to setup. I ended up having to buy a gaming desktop just for the headset. I thought our gaming laptop would work (I even checked the specs prior to make sure the laptop was compatible and I was told it would work). There is a ""special"" connector that NO computer has. It does not work with an integrated video card or HDMI. The adapter I purchased did not work. It was a nightmare. I bought this for my son for Christmas and he couldn't use it until mid January. Also, the games and videos available in VR is very sparse. But, it's new technology. Lastly, you have to have alot of room to do this. 6x6ft at least. So, we also had to clear out the den and we have one room in our house that's the VR room now.

This is a surprisingly good upgrade from the original model oculus for me. I simply plug it in to my pc and it is ready to go pretty much, you just set up gaurdian boundaries and make sure the controllers are connected. Not having sensors has been a very welcome feature. It makes it a lot easier to play whenever you want, because for me the set up required for the original model made it so i didnt play it as often. And the roomscale vr is a lot easier to use with the S as well. The video quality is crisper and noticably clearer compared to the previous model for me. The speakers that are about a half inch or so from your ears i had read were a downgrade from the headphones on the original. But i actually like the speakers, and they have been plenty loud with good quality for me. They have not detracted from the experience at all. The controllers are a slight upgrade too. Overall i am very happy with this purchase, It was a worthwhile upgrade for me.

This is the best headset I've used for vr entertainment. The screen door effect is super minimal most of the time unnoticeable and it runs well even on lower end hardware depending on the title. The tracking is great and you don't need to use all kinds of lighthouse satellites to get it. This is by far the best value and the best headset on the market. The touch controllers are responsive and a leap ahead of all others minus the valve index. I've had now over 200 hours and they still feel new.  The simplicity of 1 cord using 1 usb and 1 displayport cable split at the end is far better than any other PC gaming headset. The guardian system keeps you safely in your play area and the passthrough cameras are great. If you want to experience the best of vr without paying a fortune to do so. This headset is simply the only choice

Issue after issue with the new Rift S. To start off, I do have a computer that meet or exceeds all the requirements to run VR gear.The resolution is fantastic. The looking through a screen door is finally gone. But that's the only positive I can say about the new headset.So many connection errors it is not funny. I will try to boot it up and I will be notified that the headset isn't connected. I then will be reboot three times while unplugging or plugging it in or calling my witch doctor friend and it will finally connect. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the software.  Oh, and then there is the you need to update your USB 3.0 driver. No...I don't.Hmm...oh yea, the random white flashes that look like lightening. Oculus knows, won't fix.The field of view seems little more confined than the straight Rift. You have to look dead center or everything else around is SUPER blurry. Not fuzzy, BLURRY. You can adjust the headset so everything is closer to your eyes and that helps eliminate most of the problem but then you have a vice on your head. Real comfortable.They eliminated the little speakers that go over your ears. WHY?!??!?  One of the reasons I and many other users chose the Rift over the Vive is the mic and speaker were built in.  Now, the Rift S still has speakers but they are poorly placed (in the headband, I think) so your ears are left exposed to all the ambient noises from the outside. You lose immersion because of that. So now I am left with sticking ear buds in so I can at least hear what's going on.I have had no tracking issues, so that's nice. The hand controllers will eat through batteries like no ones business so be prepared for that. They last about 1/3 to maybe 1/2 as long compared to the straight Rift controllers.I think the headset has potential. But Oculus needs to get their act together to fix the known issues plaguing quite a few customers.  If you are looking to purchase a VR headset, I would wait and see what Oculus does. I'm not holding my breath.

I like 2 of the design changes with this headset.  The adjustable eye distance on the headset is nice, and I like the wheel on the back to tighten it to ones head easier than before.  The idea of not having to use sensors around the house is nice, but obviously too much had to be sacrificed to make this possible.That's the end of the good for me.My favorite game is modded Beat Saber, and this headset just cannot keep up with the fast movements required to properly run the game.  The refresh rate is garbage, the response time on the controllers is awful.  They have removed the easy changeable foam face plates, so hygiene is an issue you sweat while playing a game.Constant firmware updates on each individual controller as well as the headset has gotten annoying.I regret this purchase wholeheartedly.  This feel like a lot of steps back, and unless there is a drastic shift in their focus on performance I will not be looking toward Oculus for VR going forward.

This set is awesome. Right out of the box I felt like it tracked as well as my friend's Vive Pro, which is significantly more expensive. The display seems just as clear, as well, maybe even a bit more clear (less pixelation/screen door effect), and it's not nearly as cumbersome. The library of games is awesome, and when you get your VR-virgin friends on it, it blows their minds. However, this unit is not without its drawbacks.PROS: Super clear display, great tracking, solid game library in addition to the Steam library, only one cord to manage without the performance sacrifice of the cordless VR sets, SO MUCH FUN.CONS: The controller batteries die quickly (get some rechargeable AAs -- you only need one in each), there are frequent firmware updates, the built-in sound isn't phenomenal (but it's really not bad, either - get a headset if you're an audiophile), field of view isn't completely immersive (it looks like you're looking through ski goggles).Side note: PAY ATTENTION TO THE COMFORT RATING ON GAMES. Right out of the box I picked a game where your character moves but you physically do not. After an hour it took me the rest of the day to not feel like I was going to vomit from motion sickness. Most games bypass this with a teleport option, which doesn't cause the same effect, but you NEED to build up your resistance by starting with games with a ""comfortable"" rating. I'm totally fine with more intense games now, but seriously, heed this warning. :)Overall, I would highly recommend this set at this price point. I love mine.

Short review: Good VR for basic gaming and stuff but has some slight problems with tracking.Long review: I've had Rift S for just about a month now with playing about 4-5 times a week. Overall it's a decent VR setup for the money. It should play most games well as far as I can tell. The main problem I have with the Rift S is the tracking system. It has 5 lenses basically one on each side, two on front and one on top, and for most VR games it works fine. However mainly playing beatsaber there are hiccups every once in a while that aren't a result of my skill of the game or the game itself. Occasionally one of the controllers will appear to leave my hand and be floating out in space or ""stuck"" in the wall of the play area. While somewhat infrequent, in a 30 minute play time I can usually expect it to happen at least once. Also due to the layout of the lenses there is some dead space is the best word for it. Usually directly in front of and directly below the headset are the spots that will give you the most trouble. Another thing is that the battery cover for the controllers is magnetic so they are somewhat easy to remove when playing a game that involves a lot of movements. I just have mine taped so they don't slide around, not really an issue but something to keep in mind. But all that in mind it still works well and it's fun to play with.

When it works, its great however it takes around 1-2 hours to set it up every time you want to use it since the oculus software almost never recognizes the headset and requires you to reinstall all of your drivers, plug and unplug the headset dozens of  times and hopefully it will decide to work then. Most of the time these issues make it not even worth using due to it being such a large hassle to even get the headset to work like it should.

This never worked, out of the box. I am very disappointed, and I have requested a return. After about 1 minute of use, in the Oculus home app, it would black out. I tried reseating the cable into the HMD, upgrading my video drivers, updating Windows to the latest version, reinstalling the Oculus software, rebooting multiple times, tweaking graphics card settings, ALL KINDS OF STUFF. After several hours of troubleshooting, they can have it back. The entire reason I bought this was because it took ""15 minutes"" to setup. I will never purchase another Oculus product again.I bought this for use on a recently purchased Omen gaming laptop (GeForce RTX 2080), and I used the included mini display port connector. I also tried another mini display port converter, to no avail.I will be forking out more money for a higher end product that doesn't waste my time, and I recommend you do the same thing.

Like many, many reviews online, I have not been able to even try to use the Oculus Rift S because it is [apparently] not possible to get Oculus Rift S to talk to Facebook correctly, and therefore you can't even attempt to play a game, let alone actually provide an appropriate review.  There are numerous reviews online with people complaining of this problem.  There are no apparent solutions.  Try a guest login?  nope.  Try a different Facebook account?  Nope.  Try a different PC?  Nope.  Plug into an adapter (though this can't be the issue), nope.  This very issue would not be an issue if Facebook wasn't trying to mine our data.  The simple fact is that you shouldn't have a ""Facebook"" error preventing you from installing and using a piece of hardware.  Stay away from this product, it's really, really not worth the headache that comes from trying to use it.  If you question that this is an isolated event - that has only happened to me.... just google ""Oculus Rift S and Facebook login issues"".  That will appropriately warn you far more than any online reviews.I am not tech-naive.  Quite the opposite.  I have a Master's degree and a Doctorate,  And I have programmed my own CCV and IP sercurity systems.  I have never written a negative review on a product that has a hardware or software problem with an available solution - because I review and research it enough to figure out the solution - if it exists.  I have labored on this one for about two weeks.  Neither Oculus, nor Facebook has been helpful.  So I am giving up and returning the product.  Any tech-product has the baseline requirement that it should work with a very limited spectrum of possible failures.  There is truly no reason in this day and age that a product should not work ""out-of-the-box"".  I honestly have no idea if the product works or not.  It seems to be a casualty of Facebook... again....  Which mirrors the technological, social, and economic indicators that Facebook has lost their way (like lost their was 5 years ago).  I suggest, that if you (not unlike me comparing the ""Pros"" and ""Cons"" of each VR system) decide to purchase this product, that you pay for someone to prove to you that it works with your computer and with your Facebook account.  Otherwise, for the educated comsumer, the Facebook/Oculus Rift S VR Gaming Headset will be an expensive source of unnecessary stress.I wish you better luck, and better customer service if you purchase this product.

Has a jitter in the image every few seconds when I move my head around to look around. Because of the inside out tracking I suspect. Completely ruins the experience. I've tried troubleshooting this and it's impossible to find anything on it as the search results only bring up the original rift and not this one.Besides that it's also front heavy and you have to tighten the head strap dial really tightly to your face to get the clearest image. This causes my face to ache and I have to stop playing around 30 minutes in.Overall I regret buying this. I've owned every rift device before this and the experience isn't getting better. Facebook needs to invest in a true sequel to the rift or not make one at all.PS: For whatever reason they keep all the video streaming apps exclusive to the mobile versions of the rifts (Go and Quest) and its infuriating.

Not impressed and left extremely disappointed. It never worked. I bought it because I purchased the quests and had ok results. But the rift S was dead right out of the box. It would never connect via graphics card. Customer service or technical assistance is almost non existent. Email and getting responses once a day to and from doesn’t cut it for issues that need to be resolved immediately. Maybe warranty questions but not technical support issues. I ended up returning it because i didn’t need the hassle or frustration. I may buy again and see if it was just a bad unit because no external sensors are a huge appeal but may buy a more established unit from some a different manufacturer

I'd love to be writing a review on the actual product. I want to be beaming and laughing as I fail miserably at playing VR games in my tiny play space and trip for the 50th time...Unfortunately, I can do none of those things...As the order was shipped without a key component. Ever so small, ever so necessary. I'm barely going to complain about it not shipping with batteries. I didn't care that it didn't ship with the manual. I'm absolutely frustrated that it didn't ship with the Displayport to Mini Displayport Adapter. One of the actual NEEDED pieces for this entire thing to work...And it's not there. Can't use the headset. Which LOOKS fantastic, btw. Great shipping, very nice, very fast...Maybe a little *too* fast, if a key component is being forgotten in the box *THAT HAS SLOTS FOR EACH PIECE*.If I sound a little pissed, it's because I am. I now either have to buy this adapter myself or I have to wait for them to respond to me and *hopefully* they send one.At least this is the only thing I have to complain about atm, because otherwise life is fine, despite the world threatening to blow itself up. *shrug*Hope everyone is doing okay.TL;DR They forgot a key piece of the product and I'm quite miffed.

Do Not Purchase unless you have a desktop with an actual DisplayPort! The mini  DisplayPort to DisplayPort adapter is BAD! First the mini  DisplayPort adapter is low quality. I bought my Rift S November 22nd and by December 23rd the adapter was broken. After that attempting to get a new adapter is like pulling teeth. Oculus support treats you like a thief and even though I was willing to pay for two to three they wanted all this information that took hours to provide. Unit SN, SN off the box, who the hell saves a box anyway. Finally after going back and fourth for two days I might have one adapter on the way, fingers crossed this one lasts longer than one month. More importantly, It doesn’t take an engineer to figure out that with a three-inch piece of plastic sticking with a cable that is constantly being moved around sticking out of a tiny little port in the back of a laptop. The solder on the leads connecting the mini display port to the video card will never hold up over time. Hopefully it’s not my laptop that needs replaced next. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you have a desktop with a display port available.

So far I'm blown away. Setup was easy but did take a few minutes to download and install the software. The halo head band is comfortable and the headset sits perfectly on my face. There is a minor screen door effect but very subtle. The audio is about what I expected out of the built in speakers, but I planned on using headphones anyway. I have the astro A40 headphones and they fit perfectly over the head band for me.Im surprised at how many people bought this headset under the assumption that it would use hdmi. It states on their site and on amazon that this uses a usb and a displayport connection. A lack of basic research does not warrent a 1 star review.In summary, this is a great piece of hardware. Its comfortable, has good tracking, and good resolution.

I upgraded from the WMR Samsung Odyssey VR system. The biggest issues I had with the Odyssey was the uncomfortable Halo and only two camera sensors for tracking. I sold my Odyssey in order to replace it with Oculus Rift S. Not only did the new system alleviate my concerns about vr but made it far better. On a pain scale of 1 to 10 The Odyssey was an 7. It was pretty bad… The Rift S is so comfortable I forget it's even on my face.Considering price and quality this VR system is a steal! The only reason to get any of the VR is for the OLED display which sadly the Rift S does not come with. However trust me when I say you will not notice. Once you get into the game of choice you quickly forget OLEDs are even a thing. My point is if you want we are and you want it for cheap you can't get better than this!Also with all the Oculus software and support, the Oculus is a great choice if you want to do something more than just VR games. Such as art programs, film watching, or working in other softwares.

For the price and quality , this is a no brainer if you want to get into VR like myself . Only reason I'm taking a star off is there is a little bit of hassle on getting into game. Definitely look what your IPD is for this device though , as there isn't a slider for it .Pros:- Great resolution- Zero Screen door effect- Tracking is great for no external sensorsCons:- Games are short- Have to buy rechargable batteries , as controllers eat battery life for no reason- Need to be able to troubleshoot basic computer issues , definitely still has things to be worked outNonetheless, I would recommend this to anyone wanting to get into VR . Definitely didn't realize how awesome the immersion is in VR, makes me sorely wanting to get a room 10'x10' to dedicate to VR alone , but small spaces still makes it worth it .

Long story short, the Rift S requires that your gaming PC has a display port, if it doesn't, there's virtually no way to make it work. The solutions online don't work; we tried them all. This is a widespread complaint across the internet. For some reason, Facebook (the owner of Oculus) decided to use DS which only a handful of computers are equipped with. Ours is a $2k Dell gaming PC that is only six months old and sold as ""Oculus ready"". Well, it wasn't ready for the new Rift S. Whatever marketing strategy Zuckerberg decided on here didn't pan out. We returned the Oculus.

The system worked fine for about 4 hours of use over a couple of days. It started to give a black screen once or twice, then the screen went black completely. The system said that the display cable was not plugged in. I reinstalled and the system went green for 10 seconds then it said no cable again.

I want to start by saying i owned the previous generation of the rift so people know how i am comparing this.The image quality is amasing, deffanatly an upgrade from the old rift even if it dosn't get as dark for the blacks.  The way it is set up there is no eye spacing adjustments.  That said, this is the only thing upgraded in my opinion.Tracking is now inside out, so there are no sensors around the room.  This is worth it if you don't have space to set up sensors, or can't run cables, however when it comes to tracking over shoulder or down to your hips it dosn't always track.  This can be a problem with some games like blade and sorcery or robo recall where you need to make these actions to get your weapons.Audio, oh sweet baby Hades....  I hate it, it's so bad!  I turn on my computer speekers to play beat saber.  The old rift had the better audio, MUCH better.For a gen 2 vr setup, if you are new to vr, i would say it's worth it.  If you want the best gen 2, get the valve index!

I own a Quest 2 as well. If you are trying to decide between the two, the portability of the Quest 2 can't be understated, however, Steam VR games look way better on the Rift S despite the lower resolution screen. If you are getting a headset specifically for Beat Saber type games -- go with the Quest 2, but if you want VR specifically for HL Alyx, Fallout 4, or Skyrim then get the Rift S or you will be in for a compressed, pixelated, lesser-experience. You really can't go wrong with either, they are both amazing 5-star devices.

I've been waiting for for the best VR experience after I tried with many VRs headset before. Now after I bought Rift s , all my requirements are met. the motion controller are very satisfied, the inside out tracking is wide range and it requires one AA battery for each. I am very happy with it but not totally for several reasons.1- it didn't work with AMD RX 480 - VR ready GPU- due the oculus hub didn't detect any of DP port of the GPU. It solved by using Nvidia GPU.2- it required facebook account to use this VR. This VR is designed by Lenovo - a hardware company for PC- All my VR games on steam VR- which is PC- and this restrictions should become optional.3- I know this VR is almost 2 years old and when I tight the rift s for the first 20 minutes I heard a crack sound but it gone after many times of wear. Today at 16-10-2020, I spot a crack on the joint between the glasses and VR holder- in the picture-, this really made my worry about the vr durability for next time of usage.

I have used my Oculus Rift (CV1) with three external sensors for a year and recently purchased the Rift S.  I was concerned about a few things in getting the new hardware.  Let me tell you all of my worries were unfounded.This new headset feels great, everything looks better, and the outward tracking works wonderfully, and I was reall trying to foil it behind my back.  I have found two of my games have a little motion glitch if you get your hands too close to the headset, but I believe it is a problem with the games.The new controllers take a little getting used to.  After a few hours using them, I realized they feel more natural and balanced in my hands.  The halo clamp feels much more secure than the old head strap.  The mask definitely blocks out the light better.The change from HDMI to monitor cable worked out for me since I use a TV for a monitor, I was able to do away with a converter I was using.  Also freed up a lot of USB ports.  It's nice to be able to take those old sensors down.One minor complaint, the sound.  I love having the option to not use headphones, I can hear music in the room, or talk on the phone using a bluetooth earbud.  Problem is I have the volume turned all the way up and it's not quite where I'd like it for rhythem games like Beat Saber or BoxVR. There is a headphone jack,  and I plugged in a average quality pair of earbuds but volume is still not great.  I'm hoping to see a branded pair of headphones that clamps on to the headset and improved sound.Overall it is more of a step forward for VR gaming than I thought it would be.  I am very happy with the quality of this product, it has enhanced my gameplay for all of the games I've collected over the past year.Highly recommend!

I bought the Oculus Rift S because I wanted to slash bad guys and workout at the same time. In this it does not disappoint! The reason for four stars is due to a couple of things:1. Anybody I share my PC with has to be admin to download and install the headset, otherwise you must edit registry files. To me, this is bizarre that they haven't fixed this, and harkens back to my days of configuring games for Windows 98.-for those with the same problem, you can make them admin, set everything up, then revert their account to user, but we shouldn't have to do this anyway2. No aux port on the halo band. Kind of a picky thing, but there it is.3. No manual override for the eye distance settings. I wear glasses, and the thing is blurry for me about 80% of the time, but not bad enough that I can't use it.4. Audio passthrough for Windows 10 refuses to work, and Windows 10 doesn't know how to intelligently switch audio outputs whether the headset is being worn or not.None of these make me wish I hadn't bought it, though, so a solid four stars for this thing. Well made, comfortable, good titles available, and I wasn't upset at paying $400 for it, which for me is saying something for a gaming machine.

My major complaint is Oculus forcing a Facebook login and blacking any existing Oculus accounts within the next 2 years. Sadly happened after I bought the Oculus or I would've passed on it.the system itself my issue has been with the controllers. even when off they will drain the batteries. Takes a while but its disheartening to come back after not playing for a month and having to swap out what were new AA batteries. Aside from that they track very well. No issues there.It does a good job of remembering your ""Guardian Zone"".  Tends to only not find it when the room isnt well lit but its real quick and easy to create a new zone.The 5 meter cable is not as long as you'd think at times and I highly suggest routing it in a way that keeps the cable from pulling at the connections in case you take a step too far.

I love the clarity of the display and would have kept it, but I am simply not able to wear it for long. After just a few minutes it start cutting into my cheeks until it is too painful to keep wearing. It is because of it's angle that cannot be changed. The bottom is just way too close to my cheeks.The VR tracking is also a big downgrade. No more hands behind the body and I had trouble with the controllers in Angry Birds VR losing track.The controllers themselves are less balanced and the ring no longer protects the hand from hitting a table or such.The speakers are a total down grade, but I suppose they will not longer break as easily which was a major design flaw of the Rift. The sound is dimensional, but tinny.I loved the new setup, super sweet. Altogether a big disappointment. Now I understand why some people left Facebook over this headset.

Much improved display resolution means I can read instruments in flight simulators for the first time in years in VR.  That's my main reason for upgrading from the CV1.However, they've given up completely on sound as being part of the VR experience.  It's terrible, utterly terrible.Headphones are now required, which brings us to the clunky fumbling around the original Vive users had to deal with, except that the head band is so thick most headphones won't fit over it.I don't understand why they would go through the hassle of making moderate improvements to visual detail and then completely trashing the sound experience.There are 3d-printed adapters out there which allow you to jam in some over-the ear earphones and roughly simulate the experience of the CV1, but they are not pretty or as friendly.I feel personally insulted by whoever signed off on this.

Fantastic second-introduction with VR. I used the founders/dev edition of the first Oculus. This one is good, but I’m a little miffed at the blurriness and how I can’t quite seem to focus 100%. For example, when I bring my “hand” up to my face, gloves look blurry and the edges of the frame look distorted no matter how much I change the IPD or tightness/fit of the headset. I’ll play around with it a little longer, but after 30 minutes, I start to feel uncomfortable a little.

I just got it and I can’t put it down. VR sickness is definitely a thing, but I’m learning that after taking breaks I can go for longer next time so it seems to be something that you need to train for essentially. My one and only complaint is that I had to download 17gb of drivers, firmware and software before I could use it. Once everything was set up, updated and calibrated I had a great time. The software that you from oculus has some really cool stuff. I bought this to play Skyrim VR which I have also been doing but it makes me nauseous a lot faster. So certain games and experiences might make you sick faster than others. All in all I think it’s a great product and I’m sure it will make me late for work at least a few times. I may re-visit this review since it’s only been a few days since I opened the box.

Would like to point I've never experienced VR before, but this VR set is AMAZING when it works. The IPD seems fine on default... Changed it via software and show no changes in vision soz. Gameplay so far is amazing. Only games i tried is beat saber and skyrim so far.Give this a 5 star for graphic, ease of use, setup. Rated 4 due do the issues i ran into so far, and absolutely hate that dumb advertisement window that pops up every time i put headset on for oculus software. Should be option to disable just that tbh unless there is and haven't found it.I've read all the issues and troubleshoot steps of head of time before purchase, and to say the least i was expecting issues. and yes this thing was a bit of a pain to setup. First of all its states my USB3.0 is not compatibility... yet it still plays and opens everything. Only real issue i had was it kept disconnecting, likely due to the  USB 3.0. With all the troubleshooting i read online on reddit etc, i somehow got it to stop disconnecting for now. We'll see, even though it still states my USB3.0 not compatibility.Another issue i ran into on Day 3 of use is that the oculus software (Version 12.1) keeps telling to setup my guardian when it was already setup muliple times a day. I believe it still has something to due with the incompatibility of the 3.0 ports using ""VIA USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller -1.0 (Microsoft)""Since my mobo (MSI GA-78LMT-USB3 6.0) is a small form factor, i have no more PCI-E slots or anything for a PCIE Expansion card, only slot i had was PCI, which heard PCI USB 3.0 doesnt work in most cases and some cases it does. So took my chances with ""StarTech.com 4 Port PCI SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Adapter Card with SATA/SP4 Power - Quad Port PCI USB 3 Controller Card (PCIUSB3S4)"" Read this PCI slot worked for some.My PC Specs;Win10 Version 1909 Pro editionGPU: GTX1060 OCCPU: FX8370 eight core clocked at 4.2 Mhz24GB RAM clock at 1600Will update once i get the card today to see if the incompatibility 3.0 ports can be resolved...UPDATE: ""StarTech.com 4 Port PCI SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Adapter Card"" Did not work saddly, spoke with start tech support and advised they have no PCI Cards that would support the amount of data that oculus occurs since only 1 channel card. Advised only the PCI-E would work. Saddly do not have a PCI-e slot available. So have to upgrade mobo or deal with the issue. (Personally can't upgrade as it requires upgrading to DDR4 Ram and AMD4 cpu slot as my mobo is older side with DDR3 and AMD3 slot., so will deal with the issue till upgrade in near future saddly)As for the issue, even those ports states incompatibility, it rarely disconnects, maby once a day if cables loose. As for the oculus software forcing to setup gaurdian all the time. This is still happening and apparently its oculus software that the issue and is known.So overall loving the experience except for the 2 main issues.UPDATE: 6/20/2020Recently upgraded my PC motherboard to MSI MPG X570 Gaming Plus board with Ryan 7 3700x, DDR4 RAM and NVMe SSD. Ran for 2-3 months, and have not one single issue with it disconnecting. Everything seems to run smoothly and runs on max quality. (Still have my GTX 1060 Gaming X OC graphic card.)

I can finally say I'm very satisfied with my purchase.I bought this around Christmas, and it worked like a charm.Then issues started to appear...The headset didn't work well, the software wasn't detecting it, and if it did the games where laggy as hell (and mind you, my computer meets the requirements).After a month of struggling with it and not been able to find a solution on my own, the Oculus support was wonderful helping me with it, and now that issue is finally non-existant.The only problem with it is for people with glasses such as myself.. I ended up scratching one side on the lenses with them, even though it didn't feel like my glasses were touching them, so if you're a glass wearer, consider using contact lenses.Mic worked decently I suppose, i only used it once.The integrated speaker isn't really the best, but decent enough.. I don't really use it and just resort to the computer speakers.The bloody controllers though.They can be a bit uncomfortable after using them for a while, specially in Beatsaber.. The cover for the batteries is magnetic, and playing high speed songs is dangerous as it just slides right off... The only solution is to use tape to keep it in place or buy a grip for it, which I did.

Oculus forces an always on software for you... sometimes after turning it off it can for some reason use 10+ gigs of ram until you force shut it off with task manager.Facebook login, I really don't care it's fine, least of my worries.Make sure you have a 3.0 slot on your PC (The USB slot is blue)Have to always have the Oculus program on to use the VR (but I assume you already know that)Other than that not too shabby. I've never experienced a VR before so the 80hz vs 90-144 doesn't matter to me, beat saber is really fun and is the main game I'll play on this thing.Really sturdy and well made, fits comfortably EVEN WITH GLASSES ON though they'll fog up sometimes.I'd honestly give it 5 stars if it didn't have this always on software that you CANNOT turn off unless you uninstall the entire thing.

From the headline, yes, the headset, and right controller are broken. First thing I noticed was extremely terrible tracking with the right controller in the first month of usage (I bought this headset at the start of January this year), and in the second month, the controller was completely unusable, constantly losing tracking after any sort of motion. I dropped the headset onto the carpet yesterday night, and tonight, when I was going to get on for a little, the cameras were not working, I immediately hopped on amazon to see if I could get a refund, but all I can do is write this review. Also, in the second month, I contacted support and basically all they said was, ""restart the device"", or ""restart your pc"", or ""delete and re-add the headset"", basically completely worthless support, as I already tried all those things to no avail of the controller working. Thanks for the giant waste of money and awful support Oculus!

I pre-ordered the Rift-S and couldn't wait to get my first VR headset. Although the specs on my PC indicated I could use it without a problem, all I had was problems. Nothing worked, I did troubleshooting for days. Thought I just needed a new headset so sent it back but still had the same problems. Installed a PCIe USB but no dice. Wanted a new graphics card anyway so installed a 2060. Still nothing. Ended up installing a new MoBo, processor and 16 gb of memory. Runs like a champ. I *shouldn't have needed to make such pricey upgrades according to their recommendations but that's what I needed. There are always tweaks that can be incorporated to make it a better experience, once your hardware is good to go.When you purchase systems like this early, you gotta expect glitches. Not perfect but is amazingly fun. Early users can let them know what needs to be done better and I'm hoping they'll listen. I use it daily and have incorporated boxing into my workout. Doesn't even feel like a workout but burning an extra 200-500 calories and having fun doing it.Some of my favorites, Fallout4, Skyrim are beautiful. To be immersed in games I've loved and played for years is unbelievable. Best of luck to all users, I hope the experience improves so we can all have a blast!

When the oculus rift s decides to work it can be an incredible gaming session so its an incredible shame that the rift s works less than a quarter of the time I use it.I will have 3 different devices troubleshooting using reddit, oculus support site, and youtube and still will struggle to fix it. For every 20 hours I waste trying to get this machine to simply boot up, I get maybe 2 hours of gameplay (save for bugs and crashes).I do not know if its the hardware, the software, or the clunky UI but this device is incredibly unreliable. Don’t waste your money on frankly half-assed products

I have just returned from the post office where I had to pay $30 to send back this product.  I will only be reimbursed $3.99 according to the email I received from Amazon.  Not only was a defective product dispersed, but I have to pay for the privilege of mailing it back.  We tried this thing on 2 different computers, one specific to gaming.  After waiting days for a response from Oculus support, my son followed all instructions and we are now sitting here with the blue screen of death for the last 3 days.  Christmas day for my son was disappointing to say the least.  I hear many people also have issues with this product.  Shame on Oculus/Facebook for not working out the bugs first and shame on Amazon for treating a once loyal customer as if they were just the little person out there.  It's the little people consumers that add up to many consumers.  Companies would do well to remember this.

I decided to purchase the Oculus Rift S so I could use it with the Flight Sim, DCS: World.  It took me some effort and some trial and error during setup, but once I finally got everything working smoothly I was genuinely impressed.PROS:* - Integrated Headtracking.  The Rift S uses its headset-mounted cameras to detect your movement and determine your position in the world, which means I didn't have to buy and set up IR cameras or sensors in the corners of my room that would take up extra space and cost more money.  When I sit in the cockpit of an aircraft in my sim, I look around as if I'm really there.  I can glance down at my instruments as I'm flying.  I can look to the left or right and check the position of the airfield as I'm making my approach.  I can look over my shoulder to see which way that bandit is turning after the merge.* - Higher Resolution.  Images in the Rift S look clear.  In a flight sim, this means I can read the instruments in my cockpit without having to use an awkward and unrealistic zoom feature.* - ""WOW"" Factor.  There is no way to describe what its like to experience VR in a way that someone who has not experienced would understand just how awesome it is.  To interact with virtual creatures.  To stand at the edge of a virtual skyscraper and look down.  To sit at the controls of a fighter jet as it's thrown off the deck of a the carrier.  It has to been seen to be believed.CONS:* - USB Port issues during setup.  I experienced issues with the Rift S not communicating with the Oculus Software because of my USB 3.0 Drivers.  After some research and troubleshooting, I discovered that by simply uninstalling my drivers and reinstalling the generic drivers that came with Windows 10, the problem could be avoided.* - Windows Update issues during setup.  I experienced issues with the Rift S not communicating with the Oculus Software because of Windows Updates.  Simply making sure Windows 10 was fully updated solved that issue.* - USB Power issues during setup.  I also had problems with the Rift S not working because it could not draw enough power through my motherboard's USB 3.0 ports.  I solved this by purchasing a powered USB hub and plugging all my other devices into the hub.  Once the Rift S was the only device (other than my keyboard and mouse) connected to my motherboard directly, it had no further issues.Setting up the Rift S was tricky, and I had several problems as I tried.  The most common issues encountered are not the fault of the manufacturer however, and most issues are very well documented.  The end result however, was well worth the trouble.  Quite frankly, now that I've experienced Flight Simulation in VR I'm not sure I could go back to using a flat-screen monitor.

First off, if you've never experienced VR, you should. An affordable VR system is fine too just to get your foot in the door if otherwise you wouldn't tried it at all. There are definitely moments where you can see, plainly, that it is the future of gaming and MANY other applications. My gripes:1) the audio is okay if you like being aware of your surroundings, it doesn't cover the ear, but it's not great quality either.2) I don't know why Oculus went with inside-out tracking without foreseeing the problems created by it, notably, with shooting games. It replaces one solvable problem (stand placement) with an unfixable problem (blindspots). Seemingly reinventing the wheel.3) the rift S absolutely EATS controller batteries, if you buy this, remove the batteries after use. They do not turn off, and sleep is very inefficient. I am on replacement #3.

Product is very hit and miss. It is awesome when it actually works, but getting it to consistently work is a great hassle. Sometimes the headset will go black til you reboot. Sometimes the controllers lose tracking in the middle of a games, it's just not the experience I wanted out of a 400 dollar headset. I am returning this one, and I am gonna wait for something better to come out, or for the issues with this one to be ironed out

WARNING.DO NOT PURCHASE AN OCULUSThis product hands down was and is the worst electronic piece of equipment I have ever purchased. The Rift S worked for 2 weeks and stopped functioning with a error message ‘Not tracking’. I was out of the 30 day refund warranty due to the fact it was a Christmas gift and I had purchased it a month prior. Oculus DOES NOT [Emphasis added] have a customer service phone number and the only means of contact with them is a chat room with uneducated employees (probably contract overseas employees) and e-mail. I sent 31 e-mails and I received 30 reply’s from 30 different employees with suggestions ranging from I needed to uninstall windows 10, reinstall it, needed a better computer (I purchased a $3,000 high end gaming computer a month prior), all the way to computer coding. Each time I sent an email I received some other computer technical suggestion well above my pay grade and education. So the final e-mail was for them to give me a name, phone number and address so that I could send a small claims (law) suit so that I could see them in court. This was the last time I heard from them and now they refuse to reply.Oculus, who is now owned by Facebook, WILL NOT [emphasis added] honor their 1 year warranty. Do not purchase this product. If you do purchase a Oculus please get it from a store that sells an after market warranty due to the fact Oculus will not honor its warranty.

the headset is amazing and comfortable.Pros:- very nice resolution and graphics same with the colors are very nice.- comfortable to wear for a long session, ofc it vary from one person to another.- its an inside out tracking yet it does an excellent job on tracking controllers and moving around.- light weight and doesnt feel bulky on the head or feels or pulling on your head.- great lenses with VERY minimal barely noticeable SDE (Screen Door Effect).- Passthrough+ is an amazing feature that lets you see your surrounds without taking the headset off.Cons:- Although the colors look REALLY good as an LCD the blacks do look abit washed out yet they are not as bad as people claim them to be compared to an OLED, yes its not as good or better but not as bad.- Built-in speakers again not as bad but they are lacking in some areas, good to hear ""voices"" but not good for music or heavy sounds like guns or a scene with dramatic SFX going on, plus they dont isolate you so the immersion isnt there, you will get distracted since sounds around you will get mixed up with the speaker alot if your in a noisy house/room.- Fixed IPD, cant change it physically only software so make sure you measure your IPD before buying or try them first they fit 63-65 i fit in that range so i cant comment on how it feels for someone higher or lower than that.TIPS/NOTES:- If you wear glasses beware you might scratch the lenses since they sit VERY close to the eye, best to invest in prescription lens adapters OR a 3D printed rings (cheaper or if you have a friend with a printer can make them for free) that fit around the lenses to add some space between yous glasses and lens.- Good to buy a lens cover to avoid dust or accidental scratches while moving it around.- Cable pulleys are a must if you like to play moving around alot since the cable can get tangled around you and its pretty annoying, and it might get dangerous for sudden movements might pull hard on the cable and break something.Overall a very good headset nice quality and excellent tracking that doesnt break the bank, i recommend this not only for beginners even for veterans people say its good for people who are getting into VR but they say that because of the ""price"" while its more than that.but before all of this try it before you buy it.

I deleted my facebook account a few years back because I wasn't happy about them harvesting my data, now not only did I buy their product but they are forcing me to open a new account just so they can continue to make money off my data.  so it gets three stars for the price and performance, loses two for being shady.

Unless you plan on researching every single component of your rig (down to the USB controller), I do not recommend purchasing a Rift.  It probably will not work, and if it does, it may not work after the next Oculus update.  I have two computers that are capable of running the Rift according to the listed system requirements,. but upon installation I learned that one required me to buy a new, powered PCI-E USB controller (because the one from the MB is blacklisted), the other ran the Rift, but required troubleshooting every fourth or fifth time I powered it on and also required me to disconnect and reconnect the USB cable every time I ran the Rift and now gives an error message related to the mini DV port.  If you contact Oculus support, they will give you an endless runaround, repeating the same steps, requiring additional purchases, troubleshooting on machines you may not have, going to a physical store to look at items there, etc.  My email chain with them regarding these issues is currently up to 19 messages with no resolution.  This is really a piece of technology that should be in beta testing, not released to the market loaded with glitches with responsive but frustratingly unhelpful support.

It’s not a bad headset. Lemme start off with that. I myself did not enjoy it though. I think there were some day one issues and I’m not going to fault it for that. The resolution was a great improvement over the rift, the tracking was amazing, the comfort was a bit better than the rift, and I loved the pass through feature while I had it. It was easy to setup, and I didn’t hate the headset. Now the controllers were not as comfortable as the rifts, which is the only thing that was kinda bad about the headset. Some day one issues I had were these, the mic didn’t work for more than 10 minutes, before it cut out. I’d have to restart the headset which was a hassle because the headset sensor would stop working after a fresh restart and would recognize my face was in the headset, meaning it wouldn’t turn on until I restarted it a second or sometimes a third time. Fairly often the screen would flash like snow on a tv for a split second. I play be chat so when my hands were close to my face they wouldn’t track, which is really because of inside out tracking so I’m not ganna make a big deal out of it. The headset was comfortable but not the best, there would be lines on my face after I used it Unlike the rift and the vive. It was strange adjusting to the software based ipd, and my frames were not the best in vr. Mind you the requirements are about the same minimally as a rift, so I shouldn’t have had that issue if anything it should’ve run a lot smoother. Oculus has potential. I was hoping to be blown away, but I wasn’t. This is not a rift upgrade this is a 1.5 upgrade. All in all if you’re one of those people that just wants vr for one certain game, say vrchat, I’d suggest sticking with the rift.

Ordered this for Christmas for my son.  When we opened the box on Christmas morning and you could clearly see that it was a used headset.  Everything was just thrown in the box.  The headset and controllers were dirty and had hand smudges all over them.  He couldn’t play on it because now we have to send it back for a new one that is not used and dirty.  Spending almost $400 on something like this you should expect to receive a new headset.

I end up going to the EU for them. plus to replace my lens on my glass will cost me way over $100. so in all total, it cost me way over $600. so much for cheap...another thing I do want point out. it great that you do not need to set up cam around your room. it on VR. there is limited what it can do but for that limited, it still does a very good job. if you ware glass, do not use them in VR, highly recommend you order custom made VR glass! it will save your glass from getting ruin!

I loved this - but if I am being honest I did return before 30 days.Reason being is, I thought VR was much higher resolution than I anticipated. I didn't do my research, which is my fault. After a weeks play, I noticed a lot of the finer details of the VRs display that I could not tolerate. I will be happy to make a fully committed VR purchased once I am able to confidently know a headset will be at a resolution quality I can look at for hours.However, the headset and controller are incredibly comfortable. Simple set up, easy to understand, at least for me. Every game I played on it felt great!

I cant explain how disappointing it is that i have to write this review. My whole experience with this headset is filled with constant bugs, glitches, and countless rage quits because of oculus' crappy products. 1. The battery life sucks. Will only last at most a week before having to replace them. (I play like 1 or 2 times a week with 1 to 2 hour sessions) 2. Left controller cuts out when i shake it too hard. You might say ""then dont shake it too hard"" I get that but i play beat saber. Extremely fast beat saber levels. So i kinda have to swing hard. A simple fix is put a small piece of tin foil (or aluminum foil) in between the negative terminal of the battery and the spring. But this drains the battery way faster for some reason. 3. The software sucks. Every time i boot up my pc to play vr, i have to switch inputs every time which is really annoying. And no its not my pc because the next day, i can plug them into its original port and it will work fine. 3.5. This doesn't add to it but i hit my right controller on stuff a few times and the ring cracked. That was really my fault though. It works fine surprisingly. I dont recommend this and i regret buying it. Buy a quest 2 at least. Dont buy this.

I've been a fan of Oculus Rift since the early prototypes.  When the device works, it's amazing, but it's a heck of a battle to get there.  Here's my experience:Upon first hooking up my Rift S, the setup program detected the USB 3.0 port and DisplayPort, then I clicked Continue to go on.  The ""Sensor Test"" failed, after which the USB 3.0 port no longer detected.  Reinstalling the software didn't work, even reinstalling Windows didn't work!  As it turns out, my USB 3.0 _controller_ wasn't giving the Rift S enough power.  I picked up the ""Inateck PCIe USB 3.0"" card for my PC, installed it, and made progress.  But it still wouldn't fully detect!  To fix this, I went in to the Device Manager and the Rift devices showed with the ""warning triangle"" next to them.  Maybe Windows installed the wrong drivers?  I removed the devices, checked ""Delete software for this device"", then went to ""Scan for Hardware Changes"" and BOOM!  Everything fired up and I finally completed setup.  This was after six days of very frustrating troubleshooting, and I am surprised that the Setup program can't tell if your USB 3.0 ports are insufficiently powered.Now that the device works, it's still is a bit flaky.  I can play one game in VR, but once I close it, the Oculus and Steam VR software don't seem to play quite right together, and the USB 3.0 port or DisplayPort stops working.  This is fixed by a reboot, but it's a bit annoying to have to reboot in between plays.  (This was also an issue with the previous Rift).So, if you've got the stomach and patience to install this device, make sure your USB 3.0 controller is sufficiently powered and keep an eye on your Device Manager for any glitches there.  Once the device is set up, however, it's amazing.

I have used several headsets over the years and developed on a Vive.  I find the Rift S to be MUCH clearer, more comfortable to wear, and the fact that you don't need to setup those clunky towers is reason enough to upgrade from any headset setup that requires positional tracking towers (Rift(original) or Vive).  The price point is fair and the controllers are fantastic as well!  While the quest is cool for being wireless it WILL be outdated in a year or less with no option to upgrade..  The Rift S however will be a solid headset that will always look great as my PC evolves.  Anyone looking to get into VR with a computer should really start with the Rift S for comfort, clarity, ease of use and your not spending anywhere near $1k on a headset that within 2 years or less will be surpassed by the next best thing.

in terms of tethered experience the cv1 is by far better, except for the resolution bump on the rift s EVERYTHING else is a trade off.Pros:- Resolution- Longer CableCons:- Tracking (Compared to 3 camera setup)- Constant Troubleshooting and requiring a PC restart/Service restart if computer has been idle for over 12 hours or so- 80hz (Somehow the 72hz of the Quest feel much better than the 80hz of the S. the 90hz of the cv1 is perfect)- Correct Lighting/Requiring to setup guardian each time- not being able to just wear the headset and play!- Comfort the overall experience made me think more about me wearing a headset than actually playing a game.Returned this and got a Quest instead locally, and while its front side heavier, with some add-ons you get much better experience than any other headset out there for both stand-alone and tethered.

Every time I put it on I've got about a 50/50 chance it'll work. When it does, its great! Otherwise;-Has a habit of 'resetting' where it disconnects and reconnects while I'm playing a game, causing me to have to restart the game-Sometimes it'll just have an orange light and refuse to work, although the Oculus app says its good to go-The controllers like to get stuck in the ground and only track their movement, not location. Thus unplayable.If I'm lucky, I can just unplug the headset and plug it back in and I'm good to go. Usually, however, the only fix is to completely restart my computer. There has been no correlation between the problems and solutions, either. All of my problems are sometimes fixed by replugging the headset and all of my problems are sometimes fixed by restarting my computer.Overall, this product is a hot pile of garbage and is quickly becoming an expensive paperweight. This was a complete waste of my time and money.

I cannot go back to the previous CV1 model after using this. I can't even feel compelled to sell the older model just because I'd feel like I'm doing the buyer an injustice by investing it in than this.I used to get sick after 20 minutes using the CV1 model due to the lens glaring issue and screen-door effect. Now, not only is the picture quality more clear, you can actually read texts with clarity.Clearly the S in Oculus Rift S stands for superior, because this is by far the superior Oculus.HIGHLY recommend those who have the older Oculus to invest in this.Combine this with a pair of Seabands, and your VR motion-sickness days are over.

When i first got the rift s, i was blown away by vr, it was amazing, and i loved playing it, the rift s brought my dream to life, its really good quality for the price, but oculus messed up really bad, after a month of use, the tracking just stops after playing something for longer than 10 min, this is annoying because it cannot be fixed, ive dredged the internet for fixes, and there is nothing, its a malfunction with the headset that causes the tracking cameras to go completely static and detect nothing, luckily im within my return period for the item (thank god) and im going to add another 100$ and just buy a vive.

I purchased this for use with Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS) and it serves it's purpose.  Not sure I will ever go back to 2D flying.  I am a bit disappointed in the resolution for MSFS.  Seems you're looking through a screen door - or real close up on an old CRT television. You can see pixels.  That doesn't detract from the experience and may have more to do with MSFS than the headset.  I'm also disappointed that Oculus ties you to Facebook - and Facebook only - for social interaction.  Since that's not my primary use it's not a big deal for now.

We setup a support ticket back in Jan 2021 and the issue STILL isn't resolved and their support dept isn't responding to us anymore. They seemed interested to help at first asking a lot of questions, we sent them log files and they just said we'll get back to you soon. That was a month ago! At this rate this thing wont be covered under the warranty anymore. We created another ticket thinking the original was closed or something and that was 2 weeks ago and not a word from them.

The Rift S is my first ever VR headset so I can't compare it to other brands or models. The Rift S is well put together and really has a premium feel, exactly what I was expecting. It does have noticeable flaws though, such as the tracking in the headset. For the first few hours of using the headset, everything was great until my controllers would randomly freeze in game which was pretty frustrating. I ended up just dealing with it until reinstalled the Oculus software, all my games and updated all my drivers, only then did it start to reduce. Lighting is equally important if you want good tracking, making sure you have enough light is crucial for the best performance. Overall the controllers feel really nice and the headset is quite comfortable if you can put it on right.

Worked for the first 5 minutes pretty straight forward then all of a sudden it stopped tracking position and my hands were in my face. Tried every troubleshoot I possibly could to get it to work but no matter what after 10 minutes or so I'd lose all tracking.Uninstalling and reinstalling the software just led to the headset being completely unusable and just displaying 3 dots whenever I tried to make it work. 4 hour software gore nightmare. I ordered a replacement to see if mine is just faulty but this whole experience already has me really turned off from Oculus and I'm thinking about just saving for the index.Besides these issues the FOV is pretty trash still feel like I'm looking through a scooba mask. Even more so than the Oculus go surprisingly. Resolution was pretty nice I'll admit. But at the end of the day it was completely unusable for me and just led to a whole lot of frustration. I hope you don't have to go through the same thing I did If you decide to pick one up

My biggest con of this headset is not having a mechanical IPD adjustment. My eyes are outside of the ""optimal"" IPD range at 69, and the software adjustment is just not good enough. Thus, clarity is always going to be imperfect for me, but I still was able to get used to it just to keep playing Beat Saber. Setup is extremely easy and the introduction sequence is quite entertaining. Oculus recommends having a 6.5ft by 6.5ft area of cleared, free space, so if you have a small room, this might not be for you.Overall, I'm glad this is my first real headset. I'm coming from using a S7 Edge Gear VR to a Rift S, so yeah, HUGE upgrade... the change in fidelity of the experiences make it a game changer, and already having a beefy gaming PC helps too. Beat Saber and Superhot VR should be your first experiences, since they are the perfect balance of simplicity and fun.

Great when it works, but I have spent way too much time having to randomly reboot this and restart software and unplug and replug it just to get it up properly. It'd ridiculous that it breaks this much. The ""Oculus Software Restart Required"" message seems ubiquitous and restarting doesn't actually help. If you contact tech support, they'll tell you to go through this long list of troubleshooting steps that range from standard ""have you tried turning it off and on again"" to everything short of reformatting your hard drive and reinstalling Windows. This issue has been around since at least early last year, has affected many (just do a Google search for it), and it has no sign of being fixed any time soon. Buy one of its more reliable competitors, this is crap.

Full disclosure, I'm autistic and suffer some pretty severe social anxiety. VR is the social lubricant, minus the liver disease, I've been searching for my whole life. The graphics are amazing, the comfort is top notch, the community has its... variety (but that was to be expected). It's my own personal 3D movie theatre, vacation retreat, Inebriator, and escape from reality. VR is a life changer for me and the Oculus Rift S was the perfect choice to make that change.

Overall, it's the best PC VR headset you can get for the price at the time of writing this review (Oct. 1st, 2020).Pros:- The headset itself is comfortable.- Extremely easy to set up, and includes a nice tutorial for gestures.- Allows you to enable unknown sources for SteamVR games. The Oculus store has a decent selection of games regardless.- Controllers are easy to use.- Automatic graphics settings based on your PC hardware.- Displays look nice.- PriceCons:- Requires a Facebook account to use the software.- The included AA batteries for the controllers aren't rechargable, so you either have to buy more batteries or get some rechargableAA batteries (I recommend the Energizer ones).- Wire hanging down your back can get somewhat annoying at times.- If you're playing an active game (Beat Saber for example), the lenses tend to fog up from time to time. This may be an issue with all the current VR headsets, but I haven't used any other headset.

Facebook/Oculus's Customer Service is entirely driven by AI.  When a ticket is opened automated computer responses are generated and returned to you without any human interaction.

My headset worked 100% fine the first month I owned it, then it randomly stopped working due to sensor failure. I opened a support ticket and after troubleshooting and going back and forth in emails for a month, they eventually compromised and said they'd send me new cables to test out. It's been a month and a half since my last response about those cables and they never shipped them to me or followed up on what they planned on doing. I even made a refund ticket on their website which claimed 2-3 business days for reply however it's been weeks. I would be okay with getting my headset repaired, a new one sent to me, or just a refund but none of those compromises seemed to be an option. I've seen Oculus Support's tweets on Twitter where people have claimed Oculus was nice enough to take a defective headset back and replace it with a new one and I'm wondering why I was never offered the same treatment. All I got was months of troubleshooting tips I already found on Reddit and other websites. It was a good product when it worked and never gave me problems until this.

So I get the headset today (looking forward to it eagerly) and while trying to set the headset up the left controller will not power on at all.  Tried different batteries and got nothing.  After shaking it a little it actually came on briefly which tells me there is a loose connection somewhere in there, although it died less than 5 minutes later.  Really suck because I can't use it to play anything in Steam VR except to just walk around a look at stuff.  Be wary if you get this, but maybe Oculus or Amazon will send me a replacement for free.  Until then I'm just ordering another left controller.

I was very excited to use this headset, the hardware seemed to work fine. But for me, using the latest AMD drivers and windows version, I could not get anything to come on the display in the headset. I kept getting link failures from the display port. I’ve had widescreen 120hz monitor in that port before with no issues. So whatever resolution and display settings the headset uses are not up to the task for AMD drivers. I spent about 6 hours troubleshooting and trying everything I saw on reddit and forums to get a display in the headset but couldn’t. I finally talked to Oculus support but even everything they had me do failed to get my display to appear.Specs:B450 Pro Carbon AcR9 390x32gb DDR4 5700Adrenaline 2019 19.9.2

Yes, I am probably one of the last ones that did not do my research before purchasing this.  After receiving and noticing that it required a Facebook account to configure the headset i was extremely unhappy.  I have a very long time without using Facebook and when I tried to re-log into Facebook I was required to contact 3/5 friends of THEIR choosing to obtain a security code and unlock my account all so that I can link the Oculus account to Facebook and use it.  I was completely unable to use the headset as I was unable to unlock my Facebook account because there was no other mean of unlocking the accountTL;DR - Do not buy if you do not have access to your Facebook account.  People also state that even if you create a ""fake"" facebook account you end up bricking the device.  Search for another VR headset.

I want to start this off with that i really like the headset itself. It works, inside out tracking is great, and the games look good on it for being a 'budget' headset.However facebook is going to soon be requiring use of a facebook account with the headset, and that's just not okay with me, so dont but this if you're a not a fan of facebook.Another con is that you have to boot into the occulus app before doing anything, since i only use steam vr this adds like 5 minutes of crap to my bootup experience that i would rather not have.Honestly if you're going to get a headset, just wait for the new HP one

As many people have complained about, this has become a $400 paperweight for now. There needs to be MUCH BIGGER NOTICE on the product page, that THIS WILL ONLY WORK WITH A DISPLAYPORT CONNECTION, NOT HDMI. Don't waste your time with adapters either, they won't work. This is an extremely frustrating and common issue, you'll see thousands if not milllions of people complaining about this online. Needs to be a headline on the product page.

I cannot honestly recommend this product. It’s now almost a year after the product released and there are still serious bugs with USB drivers, the headset, the Oculus software, and syncing everything up. Just google “Oculus software reset loop,” “Oculus rift s sensor failed,” or “Oculus rift s cannot detect displayport” and see for yourself. I work in IT, and after spending at least 7 hours fiddling with Windows drivers, graphics card drivers, OS re-installs, and Oculus software re-installs (among other things) I could not get the headset to work consistently.I would contact support, but Oculus has no support phone number and some customers report waiting 8+ business days for an email reply. After sifting through hundreds of Reddit and Oculus Support Forum posts, I’m simply not interested in troubleshooting this product any more.When the headset worked, the VR effect was amazingly realistic and clear. I could even read the tiny gauges in the cockpit of an airplane in X-Plane 11!It is a shame that the headset is only compatible with very specific hardware. Don’t let a “VR Ready” sticker on a laptop or desktop fool you- that’s no guarantee this will work. My PC is also “VR Ready”. Simply put: between Windows 10, USB drivers, and other devices plugged into your computer, there are a lot of things that can go wrong and Oculus/Facebook doesn’t have a fix for most of these problems.

Absolutely incredible experience. I saw some negative comments about no headphones and no mechanical ipd so but if you own your own headphone and have a normal sized head then there are no problems with this vr system. The only problem is the number of softwares you need to install for you to use steam games but that’s not a big deal. The headset is light not very bulky I had no problems with tracking my arms behind me without external sensors and the resolution and 80hz feels incredible. Super immersive in simulators and incredible in traditional vr games. Another plus is this system is only 400$. The index, Htc pro and oculus(with 3rd recommend sensor) all cost 1000$ so for more than half the price you get an incredible headset and I recommend this to anyone getting into VR however this is a update rather than a upgrade so if you have the original rift you will want to wait for the rift 2.

Having already owned a Oculus Rift, I decided to Upgrade to the S. That was a mistake. Upon removing my old rift and plugging in the new one, my computer stopped responding. After testing things and plugging cords in and out I found the Occult conflicted with one of my USB devices. I removed it and continue on setting things up.When I got to setting up the controllers, they wouldn't pair. After three separate chats with the support team I was unable to resolve the issue. Each person would ask me to go through the same steps and made no progress. Twice things they asked me to do made things worse causing the headset to not be recognized and having to reboot the computer to get it working again.

I'm going to be nice and put the TLDR at the top; Excited to get new VR, works for one day, starts disconnecting more and more frequently till it won't connect at all, try everything I can, RIP new toy give me my money back please.I was super excited to get into VR, and when I got my Rift S I set it up, followed all the instruction to install it and when I was done it worked, it was a little choppy at times but okay, Checked my task manager, everything running fine, good to go, launch into VR-chat, and go meet up with some friends. Imediately I'm meat with ""I'm sorry""s and ""Get your money back""s I defend it, ""nah man it's really good"" and it was right in my budget. I have a few problems with disconnects and I'm told that's normal just have to check the USB port. Day two, disconnects are constant, I can't even launch a game without the headset's sensors freezing up, check my task manager, everything is running fine nothing maxed out, we're guchi still, suddenly ""USB device has had a error"" ""Headset disconnected"" okay okay unplug replug same as yesterday. get it back working, notice that it freezes up when I move my head a lot, test this, check the cable, seems to freeze up when the cable on the headset moves a certain way, -concern-. Try to write it off as my imagination and look for solutions online. See forum solution found of making sure windows 10 and BIOS are updated and turning off xHCI done, and updated all my drivers while I'm at it for good measure. PC is running better than it has in months. feeling good, launch Oculus.... everything's working, cool... Headset's not starting up... okay do the setup again, usb2.0(side effect of turning off xHCI) good display port good, sensors not working.... unplug and replug USB... still nope.... Choose different port.... nope, back to google, dig out old powered USB 3.0 hub. (it's to be a nerd) Nope still not working... try with xHCI back on again.... USB3.0 back... sensors still nope...I suddenly realized what everyone on VR chat was talking about... needless to say I'm going to put this money back into my savings and wait till I have enough for the Index or Vive or something.

No one in the household can stop playing Beat Saber. My sister said she'd like to use this when meditating. My friends are all getting into Table Top simulator now and debating the Quest or Rift S. I'm sucked into Skyrim VR. Everyone is finding something they love to use it for. We're probably buying another one for this house. For me and my friends, this head set is fantastic. The tracking of headset and controllers is very precise and good, no issues there. I was worried it'd be worse than base station setups, but it works flawlessly. Guardian system is very good and helpful. Much better experience than Vive (original) I tried a few years ago IMO.

The rift S was awesome and worked for about 2 months but then it just stopped working (nothing changed), telling me to restart the headset over and over again.I asked for support from the Oculus support, they responded quickly with a set of actions and info they needed.After all the info was sent, radio silence!I keep pinging and keep getting a response of ""we are working on it"".It has been 3 months now and still the very expensive VR set is sitting like junk at home.I would expect after a few weeks if they don't know how to resolve it, they would either send a new one or a refund alas they just keep responding to my chats with: ""I understand your frustration but there is nothing I can do"".My suggestion if you want a VR set go with a different company.

The new generation headsets are being released, nonetheless I'd say the Rift S beat out the competition at least during it's time, with its significantly cheaper prices and nearly identical performance. For the future of Oculus I'm not so certain, but Rift S is great, and even with new gen releases I feel no need to upgrade yet; it's going to stay my VR for foreseeable future.Only complaint is uses both USB and PCI and I can't just leave it plugged in all the time, because drivers will eventually say device not connected. After each prolonged inactivity prepare to plug and unplug.

Son worked odd jobs over the winter so that he could save up and buy the Oculus Rift-S.  Pretty awesome for about 3 weeks when it just stopped working.  Contacted Facebook Oculus Support, went back and forth with them for 4 months.  They finally sent a replacement cable.  The replacement worked!…for a week when it stopped working again.  Contacted Oculus support, still no response.  The device is basically a paperweight.

Huge improvement over the original Rift. The new lenses and display are a HUGE improvement. The clarity to text, lines and edges on screen was noticeable the moment I put it on. Can see objects in the distance much clearer now as well. No more pixelation on screen and the color and brightness are noticeably more vibrant than the original. Those streaking godrays and flares are entirely gone the first Rift lenses suffered from. The blacks aren’t the deepest but overall decent and contrast is excellent. Upgrading was like going from an old tube television with scan lines and pixels to a modern day HD television- it is definitely worth it to upgrade. IPD was perfect by default for me thankfully. No manual adjustment for it any longer- it’s done by software in the headset’s settings. 63.5-66.5 IPD seems the sweet spot it was made for. The built in audio isn’t a step forward tho. It’s weak and hurts that feeling of immersion. Definitely grab some decent earbuds or a headset large enough to wear over the straps. Wish they would have left on the headphones the original Rift had but overall the improvement to the lenses and display are worth the hassle of finding your own solution for better audio. Tracking works flawlessly for me in everything I’ve played so far. No longer any issues leaning over and your sensors not picking it up because their are no external sensors to bother with- they’re all in the headset and move and track with you damn good. For cost and quality compared to other sets I’ve used this is an easy choice to recommend for anyone wanting to get into be or upgrading.

If I could give negative stars I would. For $399.99 I should be able to plug this thing in and have it work but apparently that’s asking too much. From black screens to tracking issues I’ve had them all. I gave this thing a solid week of troubleshooting before I gave up. I tried 2 different systems with 2 different chipsets and had the exact same issues on both. It’s a real shame because when it’s not fudged it’s the coolest gaming experience I’ve ever seen.

I've only used one VR headset prior to this one. So my experience with them is limited. However it has lived up to every single expectation i have had. The interal sensor tracking is great, works much better than i thought it would. The other headset I've used was my buddys HTC Vive which has exteral sensors ""lighthouses"" and i cant tell a difference in tracking abilities. So the rift s's interal sensors must be pretty good. Considering external sensors are generally better for tracking. The resolution on the display is great, just with it was a better display overall. What i mean, is that with the display the rift s has. If you are playing a game that is very dark, The color black is gonna appear to be a little more grey than a true black. Not even close to a deal breaker for me, but some people are picky. My only true grievance with this headset is the requirement to sign in with Facebook. (May not be a true requirement, i just didnt see a way around it) i personally dont like everything linked together for security reasons but i didnt have much choice. Its a small give for the hours upon hours I've enjoyed so far and will continue to do.Apologies for any bad spelling, this was written really hastily

First off having to sign up to facebook is crap, I shouldnt have to sign up to a social media website in order to use something that I will never use on facebook.  Second, there are no install directions at all the ""Set Up"" book they send you shows nothing about set up only shows you the buttons.  After having to dl and wait the 5gb install I had to then wait for the firmware to update, going through the install steps on that I ran into an issue of my headset on displaying ... and doing nothing more.  I also have been having a bitch of a time trying to get the sensors to work at all and ive tried all usb ports on my pc 2 of them i know are USB 3.0.For the amount that was paid this should have been a lot easier to set up and there should have been a lot more documentation on things such as troubleshooting or general install directions the lack of either speaks to how this company looks at is consumers.

If you’re reading this just buy a Quest 2 and a 3rd party link cable. The Rift S is worse than the Quest in almost every regard even though Oculus is marketing them as two unique but equal products for different customers. The cherry on top of being basically tricked into buying this inferior product is that if you get one with a defective part you can count on being given the runaround with Oculus “support” and they’ll drag their heels and hand the email thread off five times before sending a replacement.

So my son has been bugging me for months to buy this, we finally saved up I got it for him for his birthday yesterday. He's been having so much fun with it, and has let me try it out a few times. This thing, I can't even describe, is so freaking awesome. He's playing some space game right now, and I put on the headset and was standing in the cockpit of a spaceship. It was so incredibly realistic, that I kept trying to set my hands down on the back of a chair and lean on it over and over LOL. He did get some motion sickness earlier, before he read the tips on how to not make that happen! I just want to invite everybody I know over to use this thing to see how awesome it is. The only drawback he's found so far, is that the cord is a little too short for him to be comfortable, but it's not a big deal.

Don't buy the Rift S. It crashes every 10 to 15 mins while playing game. I looked up Oculus support page forum and people been complaining the same issue for months and Facebook never fix it. I also have the Oculus Quest beside the Rift S. I connect my Oculus Quest with link cable into the same gaming laptop (Razer blade 15 2020) I am using for my Rift S. Quest works flawlessly, and I can play PC VR game for an hour without any issue. Quest is not as comfortable compared to Rift S because it front heavy. Again, happy with Amazon return policy. My Rift S is going back to Facebook.

This is the first VR headset I've owned, and I've found it very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time when I can get it to work. My issue arises with the Oculus software itself, not the headset. Since getting my Rift in on 1/27/20 I've had nothing but issues from the software. I've spent more time trouble shooting the software and browsing Reddit looking for fixes than I have actually playing anything, it's a shame really. I was really happy with the headset the day it arrived , the setup was very simplistic, but after I restarted my PC for the first time I've had nothing but problems from the software not detecting the Rift S as connected and having to restart the application.

Firstly, the product itself is worth the value, suspiciously so. It's become apparent that the backing of facebook has made it easy to sell at a low price to undercut competition, now with the advent of requiring a facebook account to play with oculus. That is not my main gripe, however. No, I am saddened to say that within a year of buying the product with moderate usage, the unit seems to have just died out right.For a moment, I thought VR finally advanced past the cost prohibitive stage, but unfortunately for now, it seems I was wrong. The price is intriguing, but I guess you get what you pay for.

My Rift S worked off and on since my purchase in May of 2019. January 2020 over Christmas break, started getting USB3 errors and am unable to use the device. I followed all of the support suggestions, including installing a USB3 card in my PC. Nothing has helped. I even wasted a ton of time wiping my computer for a clean Windows install.$400 paper weight is what I purchased, apparently. Oculus support hasn’t returned contact for a week. I’m outside my return window with Amazon. One star is being generous. Buy a different headset if you must have one. I found many reports of similar issues people are having with the Rift S.

These are garbage, every time I go to use it, its broke and a new fun experience in drivers to make it work. I feel like turning it into scrap by its cord every time I use it. I regret buying this so much. Safe your money and don't make Zuckerberg richer pedaling his garbage. Just garbage and support is very much useless, and I mean that in a very enduring way when someone tells you need to buy a new computer and doesn't know the first thing about them but some how works as a IT specialist for a pc based gaming device. That's the kinda garbage support you can expect and the software you will receive to run it. If I could take back my nearly brand new piece of garbage I would do it in a heart beat.

I chose this as our first VR system because of the minimal components needed to have a PC powered VR system. For not needing external sensors, Oculus has this nailed. However, I can tell you from experience that the external sensors make the world of difference with a VR system. My brother in law owns the HTC Vive, and movement is really fluid. The Rift S just can’t do it with only built in sensors at the headset.For example, picking an item up and throwing it is nearly impossible with the Rift S. I thought this was game related, so I tried this movement with other media and had the same effect.Long story short, invest in a system with external sensors if you want to have the full VR experience. I returned my Rift S and picked up a renewed HTC Vive for about the same cost, right here on Amazon.If Oculus decides to add external sensor support to the firmware for the Rift S, then it would be a good choice to purchase.

The rift S is definitely the right direction for VR. At first I was worried it was going to suck but a few important things you should know.1. The screen is noticably better then the rift. Like a lot better some games I'm like Wow.2. In really low light like just PC screen I still get decent tracking but know that light really helps inside out tracking significantly.3. So much more comfortable than the rift. Especially if you wear glasses.4. Worth upgrading just for the 360 tracking ability out of the box. All the fps games are so much better.5. The tracking is better than the rift believe it or not. I was so skeptical but it is.Check my channel out if you have any questions. The random review.

Besides the glasses issue the rest of the fit is fine. Graphic seem better than a PS2 but not as good as PS3.

This Oculus VR set has severely limited compatibility with most gaming laptops. It will not work without a “DisplayPort” which is a SPECIFIC type of...display port. We even purchased multiple types of adapters, but none of them worked (USB-C/HDMI/etc).The laptop we attempted to use this with is a “VR-Ready” Razer Blade GTX 1060, but there are many other gaming laptops that this Oculus set is incompatible with.This product description should probably read, in big letters, NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MOST GAMING LAPTOPS.The design of it looked cool though, and it should theoretically work on a gaming desktop PC with a DisplayPort...display port...hardwired into the graphics card.

Most complaints I've seen reviewed here are lack of HDMI.An ""Oculus Ready"" laptop from 1-3 years ago may well not be compatible.Note, that while the Rift S now requires a DisplayPort, it does come with a Mini-DisplayPort adapter. Many laptops DO have one of these, so check for a full or mini sized Display Port before purchasing.Image is excellent, huge improvement over the original Rift (CV1). Tracking is now out of the box easy with no hassle and amazing tracking. Better tracking than I could ever get with the 2 sensors out of the box of the original (I did the experimental 360 setup). There are some complaints on tracking as well, however they've all basically been fixed by now (official release of firmware update was yesterday, but the beta has been out a couple weeks for it and I can confirm zero problems with it's tracking now)Oculus also means access to the big Oculus Studio titles coming out this year (other PCVR headsets can play them using ""Revive"" but it's an extra translation layer, extra setup). Stormland, Asgards Wrath, and an untitled Respawn shooter are all lined up for release by end of year.Still have access to all SteamVR games, just go into settings and allow apps from external sources.For only $400 this is easily my top recommended headset for value. If you can afford it (which means you also likely have a top end PC) the Valve Index is a compelling package but runs 2.5x the cost (also a waiting line for distribution). Depending on your budget, I would strongly recommend either of these 2 headsets. (note that you could get an S for PCVR and Quest for mobile untethered VR for $800... $200 less than Index),Join the future of gaming, the level of immersion is unmatched.

This headset is a gamechanger for mid-level PC VR gaming. You know, the people who don't love VR so much that they have an RTX 2080 and a whole room dedicated to VR. This is for people who wanna play VR games every now and then without having to set up sensors every time. The inside out tracking works wonders and is accurate 95 percent of the time. (With the new software update, I would say this goes up to 99 percent of the time). The headset itself is the most comfortable VR headset I've ever worn, beating the original Oculus Rift, and absolutely destroying the HTC Vive and Oculus Quest.I have two small complaints though. First is the lack of a physical IPD slider. This slider was on the original Rift and would allow you to change the distance of the lenses since everyone has a different distance between their eyes. The lenses are now fixed, which means it will look worse for the population with very small or very large IPDs. The next issue is the lack of headphones. The speakers do an OK job of delivering sound, especially when used in a social situation when you wanna hear people around you, but having the headphones on the original rift was so convenient.Luckily, there is a headphone jack on the headset, but then you have to deal with a cord flinging in front of your body as you move!Despite these two complaints, I would still recommend this headset to PC gamers who wanna play VR and don't have a whole room to dedicate to sensors or base stations. Just make sure your IPD is compatible (between 60 and 70 mm). if it's greater than that, you might wanna demo it at a Best Buy or try to find an original Rift instead.

The Good:I truly enjoy the Oculus Rift,I just got to try it out last night after returning the PSVR due to it making me feel sick and the fuzzy graphics. I have to say, its impressive when hooked up to a gaming computer (graphically) and the headset itself is 3x more comfortable. And the built in tracking makes for a more free experience than having sensors to stay in range of. Of course I must add that VR chat is also a hell of a funny good time.The Bad:As paying a good sum of money for this I expected it to work right out of the box like  PSVR did, and let me tell you upfront, IT DOES NOT. I encountered numerous problems with just the INITIAL setup. To name a few: It wouldn't recognize either the display port or the USB 3.0 due to some incompatible driver update between the rift USB and my 3.0 card. Took over 5 hours and multiple different fixes attempted. (Which if you look online there are 1000's of people with this first issue and hundreds of different things to try). The second issue was the sensors tracking during setup, no matter how many times I changed the USB slot, restarted computer, repaired oculus app, uninstalled oculus app, updated windows (considered clean install but already had to upgrade to Windows 10 just to use the damn thing), changed bios settings for USB ports, ect ect, it refused to work. 5 more hours right there. I finally got mine to connect by a fluke of manually uninstalling every USB drive and updating them again. So total 10 hours to get the headset with a working lens and tracking.Verdict:The experience inside the headset is a damn good one and I highly recommend trying it out HOWEVER it took everything in me to give 4 stars instead of 1 because of how inexplicably frustrating it was to get the thing to work. The issue(s) needs to be looked at thoroughly as there are thousands of others having them.

This is my first VR headset and I have to say I am disappointed.- The tracking was atrocious(software updates ruined it)- The IPD adjustment just isn’t plausible for people with larger iPDS- Several bugs such as black screens / flashing screens / loss of tracking mid game / headset not turning onThis headset as of right now seems more like a BETA test more than an actual product for consumer useIt was fun to use all in all but just way to many issues for the price

I was so hopeful that this product would work easily and I would be experiencing VR.  Full disclosure, I could not get that thing to work.  If you do not have a compatible PC, and a PHD in IT.  This VR unit is not for you.  All the reviews tell of an amazing product but I couldn’t contribute to those reviews because it did not work with my iMac unless I purchased a secondary graphics unit to support it.  In addition, you are still tethered to your computer thus eliminating portability.  Ok, all in all it did not work for me but you might be more successful.

When I first got it I thought it was the coolest thing I have ever owned. There was a bug in beat saber tho where ur hand/saber would get stuck. So, every time that happened I would restart the oculus. After about two weeks Oculus kept saying it needed to update but it would not update because of some glitch or something (and I did extensive research on this and made sure everything on my computer, drivers included, was up to date). That glitch started happening every day and I would have to reset oculus a couple of times. Eventually, after about two months, no matter how many times I reset it, it would not work because it kept saying it needed to update and the update would not work. Six months past and I try again and this time the update works. So I log back on and play some beat saber at which point my hands are getting stuck by the second song and I had almost beaten a really hard song. At this point, I come here to write this review. I spent a lot of money on this oculus. The cost of the Rift s plus games. I regret it and wish I had not. It is simply not consistent enough yet and frankly it is appalling that it is near impossible to use without a game-breaking bug happening within an hour.

I loved this thing when I first got it.  Before you buy do yourself a little research on what's going on with Oculus after their latest updates.  They've turned countless customer's headsets into bricks.  Their support team is clueless as to what's going on.  There's an elaborate fix on reddit to roll back Oculus drivers to get it to work again.  I've got 2 other friends with the exact same problems.  Simply does not work after their latest updates, and hasn't worked for months. Oculus offers no solutions that work and are even reluctant to admit there's a problem.

So I suppose I don’t have anything wrong with the headset, VR is really cool, and it’s awesome that oculus has found a way to do roomscale vr in a way that doesn’t require a ton of sensors.However it may be my pc, and if it is I’ll update the review, because for whatever reason oculus doesn’t like steam. It crashes, desyncs, and just doesn’t play nice with the steamVR system. To play steam VR I have to load oculus, put on the headset, load into their vr menu, set my boundaries for play (very important don’t skip this step. Let my hands and window be the last victims) and then select the SteamVR thing and load into it. Sometimes the oculus thing will crash, sometimes steam will crash, then I get sick and have to start over.I love my Headset, it works great, but I’d like it more if it could go through just steam, or play a little better with other VR suites, so I don’t have to make a blood oath to get everything working.Turning off my antivirus (AVG) does help, and making sure the headset is plugged into usb3.0 really really helps (I just recently found that doing so fixed the “magnetic crotch hands” problemAll in all 3/5 stars, love the hardware but the software is a real barrier to getting a better score

I'm actually regretting this purchase. I knew there were a few things the original Rift was superior for, but I didn't realize it would still be better in most ways. I appreciate the slight increase in resolution, but that's where the improvements stop. Most reviews state that the comfort of the fit is vastly improved. I don't find this to be much more comfortable than the original rift. And, other than for someone who wears glasses, I can't see why there's an adjustment to take the headset away from your face. All it does is leverage more weight to the front of your head, and decrease the field of view even further. I say even further, because it feels to me that the field of view is actually smaller than the original rift. I adjusted the IPD  all around, and it didn't do anything. I always felt like even the mechanical adjustment on the original Rift pretty much did nothing as well. It's also super annoying to have to setup the guardian system every time you take the headset off, and put it back on. Major inconvenience. The longer cable was a nice touch, along with being able to ""see through"" the headset, but those aren't the major advancements I was looking for. Most reviews let you know the audio is not up to snuff. I actually don't think it's that bad, and that was the thing I was most prepared to be disappointed by. I don't like The new controllers. I'm sure flipping the halo around was a design change for the new tracking mode, but setting them down is even more awkward now. The old controllers made more sense. Here's the main reason I gave this thing 2 stars. It doesn't work if it's remotely dark. I watched a ton of reviews on this thing, and never once was it mentioned. I never would have bought this thing if I knew that. 90 percent of my playtime on my original Rift was done in the dark. I had the light from my 60"" tv, and 24"" monitor in the room, and it wasn't enough. I had to turn on the main ceiling light in order for this stupid thing to work, and that is something that I can not do due to the light lighting up the hallway, and bedroom where my wife is sleeping. This thing is basically useless to me.

I real blast to use. Boneworks and Skyrim VR (with 44 mods) are both tons of fun. I highly recommend Robo Recall as a great intro to VR.  I run an RTX 2070 and 9900k, cpu hits maybe 50% usage tops, gpu can hit 100% but I never have had huge frame rate drops. Tracks very well. it does have a minor screen door effect that, for me, only ever shows up when I look for it. it's easy to ignore. Touch controllers are good, light yet sturdy feeling. Good response and feels right in most games. last thing, keep the sensors clean! use the provided microfiber cloth to clean the tracking cameras regularly. it makes a huge difference.

This is the second generation of it kind, I were glasses and it seem to be more comfortable than the previous one, also the set up screen camera was on so you can see while moving around to do your setup playable area, not like the previous one.  Specification and screen seem to be higher also compared with the previous one.  Most of your games from the previous rift can transfer over to this new one, to me this is a plus for buyer don't have to spend money for new games.

I love this headset. My father has a Quest that he really likes, as do I, but I  prefer the fit, weight, and display quality of the Rift S. It's bright and crisp and really draws you into another world. Beat Saber is one of my favorite games (the mods and additional songs being another bonus to a PC-driven headset), and it's usually our go-to game for introducing people to VR. Now that I've gotten better at it and am playing on Expert + I've noticed that I'll occasionally drop tracking for very brief moments, possibly because of blocking the sensors with my body or something to do with the very sudden and extreme movements sometimes needed on Expert +. If I could improve the tracking with external sensors, as used with the earlier rift versions, I'd likely invest in getting those additional sensors. Overall the loss in tracking has been pretty small, and it's still a wonderful experience.

UPDATE This headset is utter trash. Facebook account required and even if you give them your real info you can be banned and lose every purchase. I sold mine after 2 replacement units and multiple weeks of Customer support hell. Doesn't work consistently and all the bugs make it unusable. Do not buyThis headset is the forgotten child of oculus, sorry, Lenovo. Lenovo created this headset and then oculus rebranded it to be the successor to the rift. After a few months of use, for some reason it just crashes and the only way to fix this is to restart the oculus app. I only give it an extra star because when it does work, it is pretty fun to use. Either way if you are considering something from oculus, get the quest, oculus still at least supports the quest.

I have a EVGA sc17 1070 laptop. I used with my rift and no problem whatsoever. I got the Rift S and nothing but problems. Even though my laptop has 2 display ports, Rift S connected about 50% of the time. I am getting tired removing the display port connector every 10 minutes. It happened during game play is the most ignoring. The graphics is definitely better than my old Rift, but so what it can work less 50% of the time. I am returning it.. switching HDMI to display port is a HUGE mistake

This headset is fantastic. I still prefer this over the quest even with the cable. The games are fun, the batteries in the controllers last forever, and the graphics are stunning depending on the game. headset itself i pretty comfy, at first i liked the original rift design better but this has grown on me. not having to have sensors placed around your room and being able to draw your play space is really nice. haven't had this much fun since the wii, and this is next level. it is a big purchase but if you can i totally recommend going for it. the tech is already really good and it will just get better and better.

He talked about it every day leading up to Christmas. Opened it up & it’s not compatible with any computer we own. He’s spent all day in his room crying because his one Christmas present won’t work.

I have the original oculus rift that was scratched up after a few of my friends with glasses have used it throughout the years. I ended up getting this because I wanted a new clearer screen and I like the concept of having the trackers in the headset.Overall the visuals look even better then the original rift and I cant see any downsides even though I heard the refresh rate is slower. I couldn't see this even when playing expert+ songs on beatsaber. It really sucks how the audio is built into the band vs having the speakers that sit on your ears. The audio on the built in band is basically non existent. So you will have to have some kind of headphones but then you will have to figure out a way to set them up so they dont get in the way of you moving which is the real challenge.Other then that the built in sensors are fantastic and can't be underestimated. I used to have problems with my computers where I would hit a deadzone even though I set up the sensors in a good area and had 4 of them. With this headset that problem is all gone.

I wanted to love this but I had to return it. The main complaint is the resolution is terrible compared to new VR sets like the Valve Index or HP Reverb. Games were so low resolution it gave me a headache and the low 80 fps refresh gave terrible blur.I loved the inside out tracking but the unit is too large and heavy. The locking headstrap is either too loose or too tight. No IPD adjustment is just insane and the software adjustment doesn't do a thing.Yes, it's very cheap for VR but it's also much lower quality. Spend a few hundred more and get a much better experience.

VR is amazing and I feel it is definitely the future of gaming. I bought this headset after a lot of research believing it was the best option for a PC VR headset. The inside out tracking means there is no base station or light houses to keep track of. This makes it easier to operate and reduces potential points of failure. Or so I thought. I've had an issue with my headset for months that I've been going through the almost crucible gauntlet like process to get fixed. The issue has made my headset unusable and came along on its own after about 3 months of use. So far something like 30 emails have been sent between me and Oculus support over 2 months and this morning they FINALLY decided to give me the privilege of taking in my broken headset to take a look at it and decide whether or not I'm worthy of having a refurbished unit sent to me. To be clear I was one of the lucky few who was able to get an RTX 3080 on launch day and had to RMA that. Its basically been unavailable since launch and costs twice as much as the Oculus Rift S but it only took 2 emails before the manufacturer RMA'd it. I can't recommend this headset to someone knowing full well that it anything happens to it you basically have a brick or an uphill battle getting Oculus to honor their warranty.

Easily the best headset you can get for the price if you've got the PC and space.  While tracking is only slightly less accurate and the controllers aren't even in the same ballpark as the Valve Index, this headset is absolutely worth its price. It's missing the standalone feature of the Oculus Quest, but the visual quality isn't as compressed for the PC experience and it's fully compatible with practically all VR experiences.Althought there's a slight bit more flexibility for the Quest, it's still an excellent headset that's an easy recommend with much better performance and a great price.

Weighed all of the available, reasonably-priced options heavily. Rift S came out on top along with plans to run the cable up the nearby wall. Works out of the box, and just like a charm. Some minor issues, but nothing a restart or an update hasn't fixed. Worst problem I've had involved reseating the cable leading into the headset, and that basically involved zero technical knowledge.New beta updates have also resolved under-headset tracking issues. This is a new product, and some hiccups are to be expected, but I was pleasantly surprised overall. This is an awesome first headset, and pretty safe for the future of VR as well.Primary usage: Beat Saber and Blade and Sorcery

After so long of me having this headset, I've finally reached my limit of what I can tolerate with this device. At first, this headset was a great introduction to VR, not much setup required, ran well with my pc, and the controllers were nice and comfortable. In the next couple of months I started to notice many flaws with the headset, such as: The headset tended to pull on my hair, the halo design of the headset tended to get uncomfortable after a while too, another small issue for me is that the halo design gets in the way if you want to lay down with it on.These problems were more physical problems I had with the headset, I have also had a lot of technical problems.The inside-out tracking worked well HALF the time. Let me get the main problem out the way, the one that actually is making me switch to a different headset. The tracking of both the headset and controllers would stop, and only allow rotation of both headset and controllers, no movement on the X,Y or Z axis. This wouldn't be much of a problem if it only happened occasionally, which it was like that at first. Now it happens multiple times during one session, sometimes back to back. The only way to fix it, is to run through the device setup again or restarting oculus OR worst case scenario restarting your pc. Which gets aggravating, very quickly. (I will put the rest of the technical problems in the pros/cons list)I will now make a pros/cons list for those of you who don't like reading someone else's ramblings before you buy something:Pros-Easy set-up-Oculus menu and desktop is fantastic-Cheap-Stormlands was a pretty fun exclusiveCons-Yanks hair occasionally-Having to reset program or pc-Tracking problems-Foam wears out quickly-Facebook-Thumbstick drift from time to time-Degrades quickly over time-Guardian (the rift s boundary system) will occasionally shift, causing you to have to set it back up-Cheap

When this vr platform works, it is absolutely amazing and fun. Great to be able to experience VR for the first time but the experienced is shadowed by continued frustration I've had with it. Setting it up, my Rift S was very finicky with what specific USB or DP ports it had to be plugged in with. Sometimes it would load up just fine then fizzle out with an error indicator which either needs me to re-plug my cables, which is annoying as my computer case is in an awkward position or likely restart. It's almost a ritual of re-plugging, restarting and praying to Gaben for SteamVR to work sometimes. Good platform (when it works) but with some shortcomings in which I've had to buy some extra accessories. Anti fogging cleaner for those who wear glasses can be a must on some games and be wary of USB/DP cable extensions as they may not always work, mine does when it feels like it. Sound is adequate but I recommend headphones, again, my unit SOMETIMES works with my headphones...For the price, it is equal parts frustrating and great. Perhaps over time with software updates it will be less finicky.

Pros:Very clear imageHigh refresh rateEasy to setupOnly 2 chords!!Cons:Sometimes the controllers loose tracking completely and you need to reset them by going to the Oculus app on the pc and reconfigure the device..The right controller seems to loose tracking very briefly while playing Beat Saber if you go too quickly to the right side.The headset can't track the controller if it's behind you because there are not sensors in the back of the headset, not sure why they couldn't have just done that.. and if you have one controller behind the other then it doesn't see it, though it will sense the orientation it's facing.

I have heard many nay says about this version of oculus so far it has worked beautifully for me including being easily transported back and forth from my house to my girlfriends house. The biggest grip I would say I have is it eats batteries as far as talking about the hand controllers but I have rechargeables so problem solved there. The controller are definitely lighter then the original and even our friend who owns the original Oculus model was having a little trouble adapting to the smaller size. The pass through works fine for me as well most say ""Picking up a glass is master level"" hah I could walk my whole house fine with it on but then again I have a bit more ram which does seem to help with that part, as the only time it causes the warping mentioned would be when Im basically bonking the head set with my hand. Overall a wonderful product and far better for those who usually need glasses as even my semi blind mom can play without hers though if you do need them still the Rift S is much more accommodating.EDIT: People REALLY NEED TO READ the specs I cant believe how many ask about it working on HDMI when it is  in the specs that it doesn't have one.Also on a side note have had my Rift S for almost 5 months now it is still working wonderfully. It even seems to handle travel pretty well in its original box as I have many times strapped it securely to the back of bicycle and ridden to my girlfriends house and back and have had no problems.

I had the RIFT for 2 years and thought this wouldn't be that big of an upgrade.  I was SO WRONG. This thing is so much clearer and more beautiful in games then the rift. The tracking is amazing all except behind your head. But theres basically no dead spots as you walked outside of where the sensors are looking. It's got the pass through view so you can see what's around you without removing the headset. Headphone Jack is in the headset so you just need 1 cable tying you to the PC and not 2. Love it so much

This is my first VR headset, and in that capacity, it's amazing. The chord can get tangled if I turn too much in one direction but it's pretty easy to fix. The IPD adjustment works fine. I guess people don't see it as an upgrade, more of a sidegrade, but not having to waste space with motion trackers is ideal for me. The inside out tracking is way better than I expected. For the people wondering why it just has display port, it's because display port allows higher specked monitors work more easily, with less power, for less money.I run it off the desktop I built:Gtx 108016 gigs of ram at 3200Ryzen 2600x

My first VR experience, and it's great so far, though there are some minor stumbling blocks to work around.The tutorial portions are easy to follow and teach you how to use everything quite easily. The controllers are pretty easy to use anyway, though I've found that it's difficult to ""double-click"" on items on the virtual desktop. Easy to work around by simply ""right-clicking"" and selecting ""open"", and I'm sure there's a way to adjust this behavior.I was rather surprised at how small I could make the barrier for play, testing it out with a cramped 4x3 ft (1.2x1m) play area and finding the Occulus software worked fine with this. Of course, if you want to do stand-up play, I recommend a larger space, but it's nice to know that small and cramped is possible, too.I found the weight on my head to be perfectly acceptable, and the graphics are quite nice and clear sheet a not if adjustment, though there is a slight bit of ""blur"" in the very center where my eyes' vision would overlap; I assume it's sure to my eyes having to look okay two separate screens simeltaneously. It's very slight, though, so I can mostly ignore it.The sound, as others have said, isn't there best quality from the built in speakers, but they do the job well enough and don't block room sounds like good headphones might. Also, earbuds work fine, and I'm fortunate enough to have fun headphones that do fit underneath the visor straps (about a quarter inch/ 2CM thick), so the sound isn't an issue.The cable is light enough that I barely notice it, and I bought this mainly for sit down play, so I'm not too concerned over it. Still, I'm disappointed about the included DP-to-miniDP adapter, as it's thick/short enough to interfere with other cables depending on your machine's port layout; I would recommend purchasing another one with some actual cable length to it (I bought these and they work perfect for me: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00YOVKWQS?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title). Also, make sure to plug in the USB *first* before the Display Port and wait about 5 seconds before putting the visor on; that will ensure the best experience for you, I've found.As far as compatibility, I've found that the issue is less the visor then the games themselves; they need to be made especially for VR, and they're control schemes need to be specially tailored to including VR and not making the player ill or cramped. If you get a VR game from, say, Stream VR (easy to do with a couple of config switches in Occulus General settings), check to see if the game was made for VR primarily or if it was adapted to have a VR mode. If the second, go into the community forums and make sure they endorse the VR mode as worthwhile before you buy it for a VR experience.Overall, if you're looking for sit-down play and have a powerful machine (GeForce 1080 / Radeon RX 5700 or better recommended), then I highly recommend this. It's got great compatibility and the experience is pretty close to what I'd imagined VR would become back in the 90s.If you are looking for Stand-Up play or don't have a powerful machine, then I'd recommend the wire-free Occulus Quest instead.

No more cameras (sensors ) cables etc.  everywhere (just one cable)!  Visually I prefer it to the original though my field of view seems narrower. I haven't checked the specs to see if that is really the fact just my perception.  I only wear it for 2-3 hours at a stretch but have had no discomfort of any sort. I'm retired and I tend to use it a lot for flight sims.  Depending on the application it can be visually stunning. My Dogs don't really hate it.

I like it. The problems people mention are understandable and easy to fix, some problem I had was the internal ipd adjustment and how it doesn't seem to make any difference when I decrease or increase it. At times I have trouble looking at close text but everything else looks brilliant and makes me smile whenever I try out new games. Make sure you have good space to enjoy most of the interactice games. And the audio seems absolutely fine with me, I use my headphones and the vr headset for audio. I honestly don't see the reason why people make complaints about the audio except that it doesn't fully immerse you into the environment, which I like to hear my surroundings in real life. The set up was a bit difficult and frustrating, but a simple youtube video helped a lot. I just wish they had a manual that actually discussed several of the problems when setting ul the headset. Headset is comfortable and easy to adjust. This was not money badly spent, I enjoy this as someone diving into vr for the first time!

I expected way more from the Rift S;After receiving it I was so happy to unbox and see how amazing this piece of tech was. I had the original CV1 prior to this.It was simple as opening the box updating the oculus app and plugging her into my gpu. After a long 7gb update, I launched onward on steam. Only to see a windows blue screen crash. This was unusual to me because I always kept my computer updated. I restarted my pc and tried again; same issue occured. I restarted pc, uninstalled the oculus app, reinstalled, made sure everything on my pc was up to date, reinstalled onward and same issue. A forum suggested reinstalling gpu drivers. So I did. After an hour or two of rebooting and crashes it worked. I got into a game of onward and immediately saw the rifts flaws. The IPD is electronically and it's not two separate screens per eye now it's just one for both. It looked like I was looking into a circle; I adjusted the IPD settings in the oculus app. Played around with it on every setting and nothing. I also found that you do need good lighting or some sort of lighting (but not too much) if not your sensors won't pick up your movements nor give you full function to your controls.

When you use this headset, bring a little slack to the wire up at the clip. If you let it hang too long, the connection starts to stutter and you start getting spots of white (like snow) in your vision, which breaks immersion pretty hard. Outside of this caveat, caused because of how the wire just kind of hangs off the back, it's a great headset! I love it personally, and the picture quality is not bad at all. Full motion with only one wire to worry about (and a display port of course) means this thing is the best form of plug-and-play if you don't want to get a Quest or something of that nature.

This is by no means rift 2, but that’s why it isn’t called rift 2.Pass through is fantastic, can’t say that enough. The way the guardian boundary works is so easy A+. The audio isn’t over ear headphone worthy, but I really think it’s good for what it is. They have made the audio surprisingly spatially good. The mic is fine for a headset mic. It really was all plug and play after some updates and syncing steamvr with oculus. Comfort level is high, but can be a little warm like pretty much any headset. (I am considering modding mine by cutting holes in the flexible should and filling them with light proof vents that I 3d print)Visuals are good for the price point and touch controllers are the best vr controllers a consumer can get at the moment.I understand the frustrations of those who didn’t know that it was DisplayPort only at first, but I have to be honest, that’s a research thing. It isn’t really oculus’s fault. The index won’t have hdmi either. The bandwidth of hdmi is too low for the transfer rates these headsets need. HDMI to display port adapters exist, and won’t work for this, because the port in your computer doesn’t have the bandwidth. It isn’t as simple as putting a different cable on the headset. And I did know that I needed display port after doing my own research ahead of time.I can’t say anything about claims of DOA units from others, but it works perfectly on my rig right out of the box.TL;DR it’s a great headset, and better than the rift in enough ways that if this is your first headset you should consider this over a discounted rift. I would not upgrade to this from rift. For 400 usd, this is a great experience.

Yep, everything i was hoping this would be was.I ran into a few troubles setting up but it wasn't the rift's fault, my usb 3.0 on the pack pannel of my pc aparently was being detected as 2.0 so it wouldnt work. Ended up using the front pannel ones.Cable is very lengthy. All you need to plug in is a usb 3.0 and a display port. Installation of software is fast and easy. Overall very plug and play if you know a bare minimum about computers.Headset pretty comfortable. The area around my eyes do get a little irritated because of the foam and sweat (lots if beat saber) but not a big deal really. The integrated speakers are fine. Nothing outstanding but pretty serviceable. It does do surround sound so things behind you do still sound like theyre behind you and all that. I do recommend using your own headphones if you want higher quality and dont care about hearing people around you but it does its job.Im pretty confused as to why this device has worse reviews than the quest. As far as i can tell its just some people didnt realize what was required to get the device working. But if your pc is vr ready this is an excellent piece of tech!

I've dealt with a lot of headsets. I like the Rift S to be honest, but whatever power demands it requires is a little too much and is too janky even with new systems. I'm sad to actually be refunding the headset but holy crap am I mad! Oculus hasn't gotten back to me after a couple days, but it doesn't matter at this point.The headset for whatever reason has been causing some significant issues with my system and video card. I'm running a 1080ti, brand new Ryzen and mobo. If there are issues with new hardware like this, I'm just not going to even bother. Not only is it causing issues just running on the system, but it's actually caused issues with other 3D applications by just being plugged in? BIG OL' NOPEI'll be going back to Vive and I guess just upgrade to the Index. That at least works without any issues. What a freakin bummer.

The Rift S is a mixed bag. The overall experience, when it works, is absolutely singular in the gaming/media field in terms of performance to comfort to cost. So why only three stars? Because since I've purchased the Rift S I've been fighting against its tracking issues for the controllers. Constantly I'm forced to reassign USB ports, restart the Oculus, restart my PC, repair the installation, uninstall, reinstall, and where it will work for weeks straight it'll suddenly become garbage and unplayable. It's a frustrating experience and I'm not alone in having it, and I wish I'd known before making this committment.

I got this headset in DEC of 2019. I have had problems here and there, but over the last few months, they have gotten so bad I can't use this device. First of all, it takes about 10 mins for the headset to be able to work on my PC. It always says ""No DisplayPort connection"", when in fact there is. Now, the microphone quality is HORRIBLE. It is so bad that I can't get on any call with the quality. After a few months of that problem, the headset will randomly blue-screen my PC. I have tried on 3 computers and the problem happens on all three.

Once it's set up and running in the apps, this thing is amazing. I couldn't have imagined VR so incredible and HD as a child. The display is gorgeous and you truly get sucked into the virtual world. 4.5/5 for the hardware.But who cares when it's nearly impossible to get the darn thing to work. The software is complete and total garbage. I used the INCLUDED adapter for a mini display port and it would not work with my laptop, I had to order a special $20 adapter for my usb c port so it would work.Every single time oculus updates, it breaks everything and I have to troubleshoot my way through it. I google help for problems and see that people have been having the issues I have for years and Oculus still hasn't patched them. I'm impressed with the number of new error messages I can get. Sometimes the device just won't register in oculus, sometimes oculus will refuse to even launch and I have to reinstall it, sometimes apps will download completely then claim my non existent anti virus software has prevented its installation and make it impossible to install the app without reinstalling all oculus software.At this point I've lost tracked of how many times I've had to completely reinstall everything.I would have thought the hard part with designing VR is the intense hardware challenges that need to be overcome, but apparently designing an interface that isn't total garbage is the real challenge for Oculus.

I have never written a review before and am no good at it. But I have to say to me... the rift S is a heck of a lot better than the previous rift ( which I own ).1. It is a lot more comfortable and honestly feels like it sits on the head more safely.2. I have not had any issues with tracking. Tracking has worked flawlessly  for me. And not having to setup and mount trackers all over my room is a major plus in my book, but to mention it frees up a bunch of USB slots.3. The picture is incredible. I cant believe how clear the picture is on this.. miles beyond the previous rift. No issues whatsoever with reading text, cant see a screen door effect and its overall more clear and less ""cloudy"" looking. As far as the refresh rate being lowered, I haven't noticed it so for me at least it's fine.Overall for me it was well worth the upgrade. I can now feel like I can truly impress my friends with it when they come over. Previously people would complain it was blurry but I have had my wife and a few friends tey out the new one and they were impressed. If you have the previous oculus and are thinking of upgrading.... then do it! You wont be disappointed.

This is a good buy for those wanting to get into vr, but unfortunately for those looking to play games right now will most likely pull their hair out because this system at the same time won't work. Recently Oculus released and update for the Oculus S headset that improves the quality and performance of its tracking and frame rate, but in doing so, some how bricked their own firmware. In doing so, you won't be able to just plug in the system and have fun, but instead reinstall the thing over and over again until it wants to work because of a display port connection issue which thousands on users are reporting.This issue can also lead to the setup not being able to activate the sensors for the headset, thus the ""Sensors cannot track headset"" error. I love Oculus and they are pros at vr, but I just got this thing and you are telling me it's a paper weight. So now I have to have a month or two or even longer before I can use this. Hopefully the problem will be fixed soon or else I will switch to the Valve Index.

So disappointing. We had the system fit to work, and we continued to have issues with the display cable not reading. We tried multiple computers, and when googling, we realized it was a very known problem. It comes with very little instructions so we decided to contact help desk...but the only want to communicate sign them is by email. You email them, they respond in 2 days and vice versa. Each time you get someone new replying to your help desk ticket and since you deal with someone new it’s likes starting the whole process all over again. Before you buy, please please please just google the name of the device and issues or problems. You’ll find many articles pop up and NO solutions. Disappointing and glad to be returning.

I have had my Rift S about 3 weeks and am getting very used to it. Playing DCS world flight sim is amazing, x plane 11 is like being in a real aircraft. Google Earth VR (free) is one of the coolest and useful things ever. It is somewhat quirky at times and the hand controller loses synch. Just wait a few minutes and it comes back. Always plug in the USB first , wait 10 sec then the displayport next. Lots of free VR videos on youtube. You do have to have a pretty heavy gaming rig to use it. Mine works smooth as silk and is i7, GTX 1080, 32 GB Ram. I cant speak to if this is am improvement over previous since this is my first VR but I am really enjoying it.

For a first headset, its okay, I'll keep it, but the lack of a physical IPD adjuster is really annoying. I can't play for long because it just hurts my eyes, its not wide enough to cover my vision properly. Theres an IPD adjuster in the menus but I really don't think it does anything at all, it says it can go to 72mm, but my IPD is 70mm, and its just not covering that distance.Its a bittersweet purchase, I love VR, but I don't like this headsetUPDATE: If you don't have or want a facebook account, don't even bother buying one of these, they're going to start requiring it very soon.

This headset fit perfectly I was really impressed with how comfortable it was. This speakers are enough to make it a great experience giving 3D sound and were nice and loud. I do wish it was higher resolution because I can see pixels, but when playing a game you dont notice as much. The halo headband was quite comfy and held the headset quite secure while I played many games. The controllers were easy to hold onto and were comfy and fit in my hand. The inside out tracking worked phenomenallyThere were many times I was playing games where I needed a steady hand and the tracking never glitched or stuttered. Overall it is a great be headset that excels at its task of delivering a great vr experience with great tracking.

My kids (15, 12,11) really loved this VR while it lasted, which was unfortunately only 3 days.  It was glitchy right out of the box.  It would periodically lose connection with my computer (A brand new Dell G7 laptop).  On day 3 it stopped working as if someone flipped a switch in the middle of a game.  From that point on it would not recognize the computers USB 3 ports.  I submitted a support ticket to Occulus and received no reply other than the automatic ""message received"".  I eventually returned the headset to Amazon, but am still out a couple hundred buck on games.  I would probably buy another unit if I could be confident that it would last longer.  Disappointing.

I was a user for htc vive, PSVR and Rift. I loved the Rift after trying all these three units. But the sensors are really a pushing factor to me and I end up left the VR world for years.Rift S is excited upgrade for me- NO MORE sensor! But it still work well!- The screen is significantly improved! The words are not yet crispy but are not as blurred as Rift- The head band is the best one among all those I tried. I was really worrying as the headband has a similar design as PSVR (PS one is the worst to me). But this one has everything solved that I had experienced on PSVR!- On the aspect of function and comfortability, I have no complaint for the Rift SFor the downside,- I am a bit disappointed with the QC. As the picture enclosed, the face mask of the headset has a small but rather deep scratch even it’s new- The plastic used on the touch controller and the headband has much lower quality when compared to original Rift. I had no scratch on the old touch controller at all even I had it smashed to the wall many times lol. But the new touch controller has been scratched during the first hour of playing. I was pulling an arrow and hits the headset...The headband also has a long scratch by touching the head rest of my chair...everywhere of the whole headset is fragile...oopsI will still recommend this to every VR lovers and I look forward to the next generation from oculus in the future.

The unit gives a very nice VR experience. My unit had a hardware issue requiring the unit to be returned, however, it is a new product so I won't hold that against them.  Otherwise everything worked well.My biggest complaint was that the interpupillary distance (IPD) can't be physically adjusted, so unless your pupils are about 64 mm this may not be the product for you. There is a software adjustment but it didn't seem to do much. Having a product that is primarly designed for a specific size head is a bit of an annoyance. I suspect this was done for cost reasons, but that could produce 3 versions of it or something, each optimized for different IPD.

Incredible, when it works. The graphics are amazing with no screen dore effect. The headset is comfortable and gas good retention and audio. The tracking and controllers are generally quite impressive, but there are some bugs:White flashes.In random intervals ranging between 2 minutes and an hour, the screen will flash white with visual noise.Infinite loading dots.Sometimes after a reboot you are placed in an empty room with only loading dots, a reset is required.Repeated setup.Prompted to setup as a new device saying ""continue setup in vr"" after closing and reopening the app. This has been fixed.Broken tracking.Sometimes but rarely, one of the hands will loose positional tracking and get stuck in the center.The white flashes I have gotten used to. The tracking and loading issue are too rare to really interfere, and the setup issue has been fixed. For my first vr headset, it's great, and I'm glad I got it overall. It's super fun and a really cool experience, I just wish it was more reliable.

There is a little light leakage around the nose and your eyes have to be lined up just so for it to be clear / in focus, but I need to make sure I'm wearing it correctly too.

I kept reading how people said it wasn't that bad.... it really is that bad. It completely takes you out of the vr immersion, when you constantly worry where your hand placement is, so you dont lose tracking.

I've had this headset for about 9 months. At the time of writing this I'm in the process of switching because the Rift S broke and I don't see the point in repairs. The first thing that I disliked about the headset was the fact that every single time I wanted to play, I needed to unplug it and plug it back in. Small inconvenience, whatever, but it was still annoying. The first thing that really marked the decline of my headset's condition was on month 8 when the plastic loop for the headstrap broke. Easy fix. But shortly after this, I couldn't play any games in VR for more than 20 minutes before the headset went black and showed up as disconnected with a pretty red light in the middle of the lenses. I'm not sure what caused this. I tried everything I found online, nothing worked. I narrowed it down to a faulty cable, but couldn't buy a replacement because they were ""unavailable"". I kept good care of it. No drops, no direct sunlight. I used it and put it up when I was done. It's not all bad though. For the better part of a year, the S worked fine. It was some of the most fun I've had from gaming in years. I would recommend the purchase of one if you plan on using it casually. If you see yourself going hardcore with VR the I'd get one of the Vives or the Index. I'm personally getting a Vive Cosmos Elite. Worth the money because of the customization that the Index, Rift and WMR don't have.

I just got this today, and it works like a charm. The setup was very easy, and the headset is very comfortable. I did have one hiccup where the controllers were tracking rotation but not position, but that was easily fixed by re-pairing the controllers to the headset with the Oculus software. Steam VR is very easy to use as well, and I have not had any frame stuttering or other problems. As a side note, in order to use SteamVR, you have to launch the Oculus software first, which should launch as soon as you put the headset on, then launch SteamVR from the included virtual desktop feature. I would recommend getting a covering for the face foam, as that is non-detachable and absorbs sweat. Tracking is great and I have not had any problems or drops with that either.

The controllers are absolutely incredible and feel great in your hands. The headset is super comfortable and the picture is stunningly clear. Last but not least, the tracking is phenomenal. Not once have I lost tracking when playing a game and being  able to achieve this level of tracking without external sensors is incredible.

Oculus, in their infinite wisdom, decided to not use HDMI like last time and changed it to Displayport or a stupid micro USB. But don't worry, no adapters work because Oculus couldn't afford to spend a little more money and time to make up for the absolute dumbest move on their part of changing the HDMI to Displayport.Only buy this garbage if you have a Displayport or Micro USB. No adapter will work. I can't tell you how excited I was to finally get my first VR headset and was absolutely crushed to find out that there is absolutely no working adapter for the hunk of junk. I really wish there was some sense of intelligence in that corporate greed that said, 'Hey, maybe we should make a version that supports HDMI? Or a working adapter?""No. Now I have to go through the motions of returning it and getting an older version of the Rift. You'd think they'd make customers more aware of that stuff instead of hiding it out of plain sight.

TL:DR Don't buy this headset. Spend a bit extra and get a Vive.I purchased the Rift s after having a pretty great time using the Quest, but I really wanted to play games like HL: Alyx, Gorn, and Blade and Sorcery, and the Oculus Link system doesn't work perfectly, so I figured I'd go for the upgraded model, but I just can't get it to work. It turns on for a moment, I can see through the cameras, and then i get static and lose tracking. Five hours of frustration later, I finally reach out to Oculus support, figuring that maybe they had a way to get it to work. After nearly four hours of troubleshooting, I stopped getting replies. Maybe their work day has ended, and I figured I'd get something back from them by noon-ish, and nothing.So here I sit. A return and a refund pending. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! IT MAY NOT WORK, AND SUPPORT WILL ABANDON YOU!

Although the GTX1060 video card will handle the basics, but there are some issues with lag that will make your eyes go crossed every once and a while. I didn't really enjoy a lag-less experience until I got a new PC with a rtx2070 video card in it, so I would recommend at least a 2060.Overall, the Oculus Rift-S was a great device.. Comfortable and the screens had great resolution and pixel density. I could read text very clearly and use the headset to work and write code. The audio was decent, and the microphone on it was very sensitive.Downside is... as of May 2019 you MUST have the Oculus app running in the background for the headset to work. This means that if you would like to game on SteamVR or some other service - you will need Oculus app running (using system resources), as well as SteamVR (more resources) and finally the game you're actually playing., all open at once It was not a good experience on my entry level gaming system (i5 7400, 8GB ram, gtx1060); it only really good once I upgraded my PC (ryzen5 3600, 16gb ram, rtx2070).The oculus store offers very few free or low cost games, most games are $20-30 each; and very few of them are ports of popular games you already know like Skyrim or something. Thus, using services like Steam are necessary if you're a gamer looking to enjoy these known games.There were times when I had to restart the Oculus App numerous tries because the headset wasn't turning on and the controllers bug out occasionally - making their location wrong and ruining your gaming. This didn't happen all the time... but it did happen. You also have to set the floor boundaries and initial settings up every time you use the headset, so these restarts when the system malfunctions can take a few minutes.Due to this I would recommend a HTC Valve or some other modern VR headset instead. Cosmos just came out which features similar positional cameras on the headset, it's just twice the price as Oculus.Oculus is still very great for the budget and for those with patience for bugs, and I believe the bugs will go away with time.

This headset worked pretty well until right around the warranty was about to end, i have sent my headset in to be replaced, which was listed to take 8-12 days, now that I sent it in, I have realized that oculus support is run most likely by an AI, if you have problems with this headset, and you most likely will, do not expect to contact a real human being. Facebook will cut costs as much as they can and they don’t have to pay an AI to copy paste the same message twice to you to get you to shut up. Do not buy this headset if you’re not ready to lose it one day and pray to whatever you believe in that you’ll get a replacement.

What a amazing discovery! How i can imagine cyber world without this amazing tool. Just next gen. Can't wait for next models.There is something we have to concern. This is why I can't give it 5 star.Forehead area just cracked the day I first used it. It may because I used it little bit wrong but shouldn't crack this easily.Resolution still lacks. I see dots everywhere.Battery draining even when not using. So better get recharable battery.Other than this this is amazing!

If you have a pc this is the best oculus in my opinion, you have the power to play any vr game and even play games that have vr mods. Such as minecraft, the hunter call of the wild with direct x or something like that. I dont really remember the exact program but there is a program that allows you to add vr support. Yes it will be glitchy but in my opinion its worth it

I was excited to get this product because I used the rift prior and enjoyed the experience.  However, the laptop I have that works with the Rift will not work with the Rift S.  Rather than the two HDMI inputs that the Rift has,  the Rift S has one digital port input (DPI).  They send you with an adapter from DPI to DPI mini, not an HDMI adapter.I know what you're thinking ""can't you just buy the DPI to HDMI adapter, dufus?""  You can, but video will not play through the headset.  It will work (So I'm told)  if you have a c-type connector that is not a USB3.1, but actually supports video.  I would look up your machine specs if you aren't sure if your c-type connector supports video.  I feel like a prize idiot for not doing further research.  I hopes this helps my fellow dufuses.

This is the 2nd one I have gotten. The first one arrived busted, so I got a replament. This one worked for a good two months, now it won't even give me a screen anymore. I have tried new cables and everything else, but NO luck. Just like a chevy, they give it to you in great condition, and then after the warranty, it breaks. Would not suggest buying this, it was made with Lenovo, and they are not a great company to do business with. Especially since they program bloatware on computers.

BE WARNED! There are a few USB 3.0 varieties that will not work! It will make the Rift S useless without new components or a new computer. I was fooled by their website that simply says USB 3.0 under minimum specs (see attached pic). No asterisk, nothing. I probably would have been willing and able to get a new component installed and ready on Christmas Day had there been any warning about the USB 3.0 incompatibilities, but nothing. There use to be a compatibility tool that's no longer available that would have alerted me, but they just dropped that for no apparent reason. I found a copy of the tool on a third party website after the fact which, low and behold, said my USB 3.0 was incompatible. How nice that would have been to know ahead of time when I attempted to make sure my computer could run the Rift S.After the huge Christmas Day disappointment, I've ordered a PCI-E to USB 3.0 component. Hopefully, but not a definite from tech support I've found (not Oculus), that will fix the problem and allow us to run the Rift S on this PC. Oculus dropped the ball in a major way. It's almost unbelievable. It's like they did it on purpose so it wouldn't stop people from buying it, hoping they would try and upgrade their computer instead of returning it since they already bought it and potentially wouldn't have had they known about the incompatibilities. What a disappointment!

Me and my friend got a oculus rift s so we can play together. I personally use it for beat saber. While in game when the blocks you supposed to dodge come by the frame rate seems to dip below 30 which is extremely noticeable and very annoying. I know its not my computer being as i used to have the cv1 and i am using a i7-9700k and a 1080ti which I overclocked just to make sure. Its a horrific experience when playing these big title games. And i know for a fact it shouldnt be using 100% of both my cpu and gpu because when playing AAA games im at a solit 150-200 on the max settings. Id say they need to get with nvidia to get proper drivers for their stuff, I didn't pay 400 dollars for a pile of low fps garbage. Now on my friends side. His controllers were completely malfunctioning and he ended up needing to send back his new rift s. So far a bad experience. I know as is it has alot of potential and it did just come out 2 weeks ago so ill give it time.

Nothing on this page would lead you to assume that buying from this vendor would get you a pre-used headset. To everything I could tell, mine was. The package the black box containing the headset came in was shoddily re-taped, there was no plastic film over the lenses as there should be and the right side of the rubber nose piece was already coming off and I couldn't get it reattached, and that's outside of how blurry the headset was and the issue of absolutely having to have a Facebook account to use it, an issue in its own right.Edit: After contacting customer support, they were happy to send me a replacement. It shipped and was delivered much earlier than originally stated (same as the first headset), but this one was in much better condition, very obviously brand new. It's still an absolute pain to set up and get to properly connect to your PC in my case and the hands stop working almost every game, but it's a start. Overall? It's one of the cheaper headsets you're going to find, and it's adequate for someone just getting started with VR.

I have been using Macs for 20 years now. To try VR games I purchased a PC for the first time after all these years as well as an Oculus Rift S. I picked this because of 3 main reasons: price (seems cheaper than the higher end HTC Hive) + easy setup + big library of supporting games.Coming from Mac background I prefer simplicity and prefer not to have set up different tripods and sensors etc.. I also prefer being able to play in different places. I bought a Razer laptop which is fast enough for VR games, and this Rift S just needed to plug in 2 cables to get things going. So I could easily bring the computer and the Rift S from my study to the living room for playing with the kids, and bring the whole setup to friends' place as a party game setup which is super convenient.In terms of quality, I did some basic research and people were worried about the slower refresh rate. I have no prior VR experience and identified no problem at all with the Rift S. On the contrary I am pretty blown away by the experience which has been much better than what I previously expected. The headset is comfortable to wear, and the controllers are easy to use. My friends and family from 7 year old to 50+ all had fun and no problem with the devices.All in all very satisfied with the Oculus Rift S which has been a surprise to me especially given that I don't like Facebook (which owns this company) at all!

This kind of worked for a few days, then I couldn't get it to connect to my PC hardly at all. Always red dots on trying to connect- maybe I would get lucky and it would connect once in a while after constantly swapping the USB3/Video outputs over and over and rebooting. It also doesn't help when the Oculus program is constantly crashing, sometime freezing up my whole PC. I even bout an extra USB3 Xpress card thinking it would help, but it does the same thing.I would have returned this months ago, but I made the mistake of hoping the install software would get better. But apparently Oculus is terrible about this from what I read everywhere. Wish I knew about the connection problems beforehand, for this was a huge waste of money.

With the minor exception of Minecraft having an issue (as of 6/12/19) of launching correctly due to install issues that Microsoft needs to resolve, it's a great headset. I mainly included that to inform people that it's not their rig or oculus that's causing the issue.I loved this headset. The refresh rate is great, minor screen door effect, my only issue is sometimes the inside out tracking places your head as if your standing on your knees. A simple guardian zone reset remedies this issue but it's still weird.TLDR;Great headset, preferred this over the Vive.

I've owned the Lenovo Explorer and the Samsung Odyssey and just graduated to the Rift S.  Without any doubt the Rift S is the most clear, bright, and responsive of these 3 examples.  But … understand that you may have some problems.  The Rift would not work at all for me initially.  My Superspeed 3.0 USB connections did not work with it and the headset could be ""found"" and therefore could not display. What saved me from doing a return was the Type C USB port on my graphics card. I had to buy the Type C to USB 3.0 dongle to make everything work.  I gave the ""S"" a 5 'cause it's a great headset, but be forewarned - it may or may not work on your computer!  Finally!  The best of WMR with Oculus Touch!

Overall I'm very pleased with the quality and ease of use. Set up had one issue: had to change windows 10 settings to get the USB to allow access to cameras. After that, haven't had any major issues. My IPD is 72 with assemetry of 2mm of my left eye. I find myself getting some eye strain and slight blurry images in the left eye. I knew going it that this system does not support manual ipd adjustment and decided to try it out. Adding a manual adjustment would have made this headset a 5/5 star device. After using it for a long time, I think my eyes have got used to it and the blur/strain has mostly become unnoticed. I'm having a blast and can't imagine downgrading to the Quest's mobile-tier graphics in exchange for manual IPD adjustment. VR is incredible and this is worth the money.

I was apprehensive about upgrading from my Rift CV1 to a Rift S.  I had my Rift CV1 for over two years.  Mostly, I wanted to be free of all of the external sensors so that I could more easily travel with my gaming PC and VR system.  I am 110% satisfied with the inside-out tracking system, which was my biggest concern with upgrading.  In fact, being an avid Beat Saber player (no, that's not ALL I play in VR.. lol) I found my scores actually going up due to the increased tracking precision.  So far I have not had a single drop out and am amazed at the tracking volume that the Rift S has now that it's been on the market for a few months (and the bugs have been ironed out).The display resolution increase is immediately noticeable and there is almost no screen-door-effect or ghosting (god rays).  Colors are more bold and vibrant due to the RGB pixel arrangement as compared to the pentile arrangement of the Rift CV1.  Everything is much sharper overall.It took a day or two for me to get used to the new head strap design, but it is a lot more comfortable in my opinion than the ""baseball cap"" design of the Rift / Quest and doesn't require as much adjustment.Set up was INCREDIBLY easy compared to the original Rift.  Plug in the displayport cable and a single USB 3.0 cable and the Oculus software guides you through the rest.  I set up a guardian in my office (my primary VR playspace) and used it for a day or so.  I took my gaming rig and Rift S to a buddy's house and set up a guardian in his office and everything worked perfectly.  To my surprise, when I returned home and reconnected everything, the Rift S remembered my room and the guardian was already perfectly lined up (I thought multiple guardian support was a Quest-only feature).My only complaint, just like everyone else's, is that the built-in audio leaves a lot to be desired.  It sounds good enough for nearly every game and experience, but for rhythm games such as Beat Saber it just doesn't provide enough bass, presence, or volume.  Thankfully this was easily solved by using my in-ear headphones since the Rift S features a headphone jack.  Also, there is a very convenient (and affordable) on-ear headphone kit for PSVR that is also compatible with Rift S (and sold on Amazon) that I plan on grabbing which will put that issue to rest.  I don't regret the upgrade from Rift CV1 to Rift S at all, and am now even more excited for the launch of the AAA games coming this fall / winter (Stormland & Asgard's Wrath) as they'll look incredible the with the improved visuals.

For those complaining about no HDMI support, you should have read into that before buying that. There are some minor software bugs that need to be worked out, for example the static flashes that happen occasionally. I get some tracking issues occasionally but with software updates from both the VR game developers and the Oculus team itself will make this thing amazing. Overall I have had lots of fun with my experience so far. I would still recommend the CV1 over this if you want perfect tracking until the software updates make this HMD perfect.

Its not a bad budget (kinda) kit if this is your first vr experience and kinda afraid to pay for a very expensive one, get this it gets you what you want and its not bad it does the job well but hardcore gaming such as beat saber is alright but not the best use this as a test if your thinking to buy a hefty vr next time, the controls are comfortable for me and i have big hands and the rift it self is sturdy and well built but the quality is not that ground breaking but ok (please notice that the vr has a display hd make sure you have one on your laptop or pc if laptop get an adapter) the vr it self tracking is very very good im amazed of how good it tracks everything without any trouble, the controller... omg it eats the battery up so fast it almost impossible to game it stays about an hour to 2 if your lucky i don't know if thats due me having a faulty unit but that could be the controller keep that in mind, unboxing was good nothing damaged and its very well packed and protected, over all its a 7/10 its really the perfect budget vr if you need one and so far the graphics on it is solid and good for me but if your LOOKING AT IT AS AN UPGRADE DONT YOU DARE BUY IT ITS NOT AN UPGRADE, but its perfect if you need it as a starter kit, but oh my god the controller eats up the battery so fast its crazy it takes one AA battery on each controller.Thank you for reading my review on this product sorry if im bad in grammar english is not my first language.

To be honest, i was so happy to receive my FIRST VR headset. After sincerely watching more than 5 video reviews on the internet. I've decided to purchase Oculus Rift S as my VR headset.However, due to my work commitments, i wasn't able to play much VR games every single day. One fine day, maybe after less than 10 times of usage. the halo band knob decide to give way. Meaning it can't tighten your halo band when you wear it, if you try to tighten, it will loosen back to the original state.Of course, what i need to do is to contact Oculus support for assistance, hopefully they can ship a replacement.BUT, as i'm based in Singapore, i took the extend to use freight forwarder to ship back the VR gear. So Oculus mentioned in their policy that they are not going to provide any support to me since i'm based in Singapore.If any guys out here who would want to get this product, i sincerely hope that you have the patience of keep RMA your headgear due to the lousy quality that Oculus have design on this Rift S.No way i'm getting ANY single Oculus product in the future. I will take money and give to Hive or Valve Index.

Works fine as a VR system I suppose but unfortunately oculus is owned by Facebook and they are starting to tie FB accounts to the Oculus System. Given FB's repeated violations of privacy and ethics I just can't trust it with a device covered in cameras, sensors and microphones in my house.  Seeing the news tonight that FB will be trying out ads in VR games was the last straw, I'll be putting mine up for sale shortly.  When I purchased the system a FB account was not required and now this, I don't want to see what their next move is.

I really wanted to like this headset. When I heard the sensors were built into the headset I was so excited, no more running usb extenders around my room for sensors. But after using it for a few days and having the sensors disconnect every 30 mins I promptly sent it back. Only positive to this headset is the nice resolution panels. Other than that the controllers and headset feel cheap and don't work. I'm using a valve index now, which does have its own issues right noe as the knuckle controllers are basically a gimmick at this point and it took longer than expected to get the vr room setup but at least it's solid technology. No hand tracking disconnects. The only real issue I've had is having the pass through work consistently. Anyway, steer clear of this headset. Save yourself some money and just buy an original rift off ebay. Or if you've got money to burn get an index.

First thing I noticed is that when I pulled of the protective film for the lenses that there appears to be small scratches on them. However after several hours of playing, looking for any effect from it, and letting other people try the headset the scratches don’t appear to have caused any real harm. It’s a quality concern, but everything seems great to me.It’s easy to setup, setting up in new environments is fine, and the clarity it offers is amazing. Great product and I highly recommend it.

However, the issue about the headset is that playing any non oculus game it will freeze anywhere from 10 seconds into the game to 5 minutes in the game, Oculus says that the way to fix it is to unplug your usb slots as the bandwidth is too much or to buy a pci express 16x usb expansion slot.Overall, this headset is great when it works, but it hardly works.

Ordered this on Dec. 5 2020(first vr headset) and last week on the the 9th of Feb. I experienced the infamous ""Black screen"" and since then I have not been able to get it to come back except for one occasion that it worked for maybe 5 hours(after multiple, multiple troubleshooting methods) before resorting back to black screen/flickering/static and even when it was ""playable"" I had a very faint static in the background that you honestly couldn't tell unless in dark areas of said game. TLDR; Don't be like me do your research before you buy I should of went with the Index or Vive but here we are. A lot of Rift users like myself have experienced similar issues even after trying everything and I mean EVERYTHING to the point I have purchased a USB3.0 - C (didn't work), USB3.0 power hub (didn't work), to my last and final try which is a 7 Port PCI-E to USB 3.0 Expansion Card. If the PCI resolves my issue ill change it to a 2 star... spend the extra cash for a better product.

It isn't mentioned anywhere unless you look it up yourself but if you wear glasses it will scratch both your glasses and the lens on the Oculus Rift, regardless of the distance between your face and the headset. To make things worse, the lenses are not covered by any warranty nor are they replaceable. Oculus support will not help you at all, any attempt to bring this up in the forums gets ignored by Oculus. The manual had no such warning either. I have lost a good pair of glasses and $400 because of this crap.

TLDR; Get the Rift S if you already have a gaming PC. You won't be disappointed!I tried the Quest but after trying the S, I promptly returned the Quest. My son has the first gen Rift, so I was also able to compare the quality between the two. The S is a marked improvement!No external cameras, better display, and almost zero screen door effect makes for a truly immersive experience. Between the S and the Quest, I'd rather put up with the cable (I ordered a 6 foot extension for only $15) and enjoy PC powered graphics than go cordless with the Quest's PS3 (some say PS2) graphics quality.If the Quest were $100 less, I'd have a harder time making the decision. Being the same price, I'd say portability lost out to a better VR experience. Since the ""R"" in ""VR"" stands for ""Reality"" and you want the absolute best experience, go with the Rift S. Not having to worry about Battey life and the 2 hours it takes to recharge, is another strike against the Quest in my opinion.

when I got it, the headset just showed a black screen when trying to set it up. a new video driver was released by the nvidia graphics card people, and after I installed it, the headset began to work. it gets three stars because it finally worked, but should have worked on day one, also I feel the image quality should be better. but its okay. however, the built in camera system that negates the need for sensors placed about the room is a big deal for me. its worth the upgrade for that alone, and it works splendidly.

This is a huge step up from my 3-sensor Oculus Rift setup. The resolution bump alone was worth the upgrade. There was little trade off in terms of tracking; the only downsides are the slightly less robustly built controllers as well as the sub-par built in speakers.If the OG Rift’s controllers were 10/10, then these new controllers score a very decent 8.5/10The onboard sound deficiency is easily solved by plugging in a pair of earbuds/headphones/applying one of the many mod-hacks available. I’d have wished for the sound to be as good as the OG Rift to begin with, but at this price there isn’t much to complain about :)

After many hours of researching the latest VR Headsets, I decided to go with the Oculus Rift S due to its portability in comparison to other models.** After about 500 hours of use **The Good:- Extremely easy first-time setup :)- If you have a powerful laptop, you can play in any room in about 3 minutes time. Awesome!- Weight distribution & comfort are near perfect- Screen Resolution results in very clear visuals. I almost can't see the ""screen door effect""- Uses a single AA Battery in each controller, which lasts about 3 weeks of casual play.--- May be a ""bad"" for more active users unless you get rechargeable AA batteries.- As one with large hands, the small controllers are extremely comfortable to hold. Excellent design--- In comparison, the new Valve Index's controllers are extremely uncomfortable to use due to their size.- Comes with a Display Port -> Mini Display Port adapter :)- AUX Port on the visor (for ear buds) is handy given how bad the integrated speakers are- The integrated microphone is surprisingly good. Very little static noise.- From what I've experienced, the headset fits children of age 10+ without issues.The Bad:- Relies on the use of a Display Port, which many graphics cards don't have.--- Display Port -> HDMI adapters don't exist the last time I checked.--- This doesn't seem to be a problem for new cards, however. (NVidia 1000+ series)- Software-based interpupillary distance modification doesn't work.--- Hardware-based versions are the way to go. Please don't use this again @Oculus- Low Light in your play space can result in:--- (Rare occurrence) Screen Tearing due to what appears to be conflicting / loss of orientation--- Loss of Hand Tracking- After only 20 hours of playing 'Pistol Whip' (total), the right controller's trigger began squeaking and continues to do so- Integrated speakers are awful, but are better than nothing- Low refresh rate on controllers makes fast-paced games extremely difficult- Low refresh rate on the display results in the same as above.Overall: 4/5Despite its many flaws, this VR Headset is a near masterpiece of modern technology. Yes it could be better, but its portability, easy-of-use, and performance outweigh the negatives. I'm excited to see the future versions of the Oculus Rift :)

I've had no technical issues with the Oculus Rift S. Setup was really easy. The experience so far is amazing. I'm supposed to share it with my son but he might be out of luck. Running it on a custom PC with a Ryzen 7 2700x and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070. I'm normally a bit sensitive to motion sickness with VR but so far I've had no issues. Lone Echo had me truly feeling like I was in 0g. Skyrim VR is just a sight to behold. I can't wait to try out some more games.

Got this a couple months ago and just opened it up a couple weeks ago and one of the controllers was cracked across the top. Will add to this review once able to play.Update- 6/23/2020 - I contacted Oculus about the cracked controller and was issued an RMA number as well as a shipping label to return the controller for a proper new one. Excellent customer service and fast reply. Looking forward to seeing this system in action. Will update.

This is an amazing piece of hardware for a very good price. It's really immersive and fun as hell to play with. Compared to the Vive I had before it the screen is my much sharper. You also don't need any external sensors to use it. It's pretty light, so it feels kind of flimsy, but I've had my vacuum robot pull it off my desk and drag it around on two occasions and it still works fine.My only complaints are over the ease of use. It is very particular about what USB you plug it into. Most people agree you're gonna want to use it with 3.0 but I run it on 3.1 and it mostly works alright. It does have an occasional issue where the tracking freezes, forcing me to restart the headset but it doesn't happen often, so I can let it slide. The built in speakers also kind of suck, so I plug my own headphones in.Something important to note is that it doesn't have any physical adjustment on the lenses. So if you're eyes are really far apart or close together it might not look right. My ipd is 65 and the ipd of the device is fixed at 63.5 and it works fine for me.Overall I have no regrets with this purchase and I would but it again. You might struggle with USB, but it's worth it once you get it set up.

I finally decided to pull the trigger and purchase a VR headset for the first time and man was I disappointed. Out of the box, the headset worked fine with no issues. The next day of use, I notice while using the controllers intensively for the first time, they started to go wonky. I figured out whenever the controllers vibrated, they would lose tracking completely and it was impossible to do something like draw a bow in Blades and Sorcery. This was a big bummer, but I decided to turn off vibration. Well it definitely breaks your immersion. On the same day, I notice a dead pixel on my display that was relatively centered in my vision and was very hard to look past. Along with that, it took me a half an hour every day, to repeatedly restart oculus software until it told me the headset was good to go. The issues I experienced was unacceptable for a $399 product. I've returned my headset and will wait to purchase either a Vive or an Index.

ordered for computer specifically purchased for VR. Hours spent trying to get to work. Worked for minutes at a time. Viewer constantly goes to static or just stops. Three people worked on this. Everything was as it should be for specs. Gave up. Returned. Did NOT work. Get a better one and not be so disappointed.  NOTHING should be THIS hard to get to work.

Oculus Rift S first impressions coming from Windows Mixed Reality (Acer, NOT Odyssey or Odyssey+):+Controllers are so much more lighter than CV1 and AcerMR.+SDE is non-existent, the Gen 2 LCD panels they used are really nice and the image quality is amazing+FOV, also the 80Hz refresh rate is barely noticeable.+Build quality is great+Tracking is extremely better than WMR, so much better that you have to try really hard to lose tracking. (Might be problematic with those who are used to FPS games, putting your controller less than 10cm from your face, it will lose tracking)+6DoF and Controller Tracking works really well even in low-light, unlike WMR.+Sweet spot is huge, I barely have to adjust the image on my headset.+Comfort is better and the foam they used is extremely comfy.+Passthrough and Guardian works flawlessly!-I want to point out that TV Static appears for a frame or so every 30 minutes. This is a common problem with the Rift S and Oculus is planning for a patch soon, it isn't intrusive but it's definitely noticeable. Fixes include re-plugging the cable, to disabling USB power management in windows.-That is the only con for me so far in my few hours of testing.All in all I'm impressed, but I'll have to keep testing it as I go c:

This is my very first VR headset. I absolutely love it.Here are some pros:- Virtually no ""Screen-Door"" effect.- Visuals are nice - 80 Hz refresh rate is still comfortable.- Controllers are comfortable, compact, and easy to use.- Analog sticks allow for fluid, easy-to-control movement in game.- Head strap/Halo is very comfortable.- Exceptionally easy setup.- Pretty reasonable minimum system requirements.- The cable has a decently good length for my room.- No base stations required.- Well worth its price.Here are some cons:- Tracking can sometimes bug out on lower end systems (I'm running with an i3-8100 + RX 580 and most games work well).- The cable can sometimes curl up and wrap around itself if you turn too much, as with all PC-based headsets.- Controllers can sometimes have tracking errors while aiming two-handed weapons in game.

I’ve read the reviews and seen people complain about how their laptops don’t have a display port. MOST of these reviews are flooding in from people who are having a personal problem, not a problem with the Rift S itself. I’ve had this product for just over 72 hours now and when I tell you I’ve not stopped playing, I mean it.I’m a father, I have a wife, a child, two dogs, and a full time job. This is perfect for anyone who enjoys some casual gameplay or even some intense gameplay. I’ve been dripping sweat from BeatSaber, I’ve been compelled and in awe by Super Hot VR, and I’ve had my breath taken away when diving into just about any game that relies on scenery.I have an Alienware Aurora R7 with an NVIDIA GTX 1080 inside of it, coupled with 16gb of RAM, and an i7 7700k. This VR has been nothing short of a perfect experience for me, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in their first VR system. Connection is seamless, the home screen is satisfying, the controllers are comfortable. (I’m 5’6 and don’t have massive hands)All of these things being said, I would recommend this product 1,000 times. The only issue I have had with this is that sometimes if my computer is left on too long, I have to restart it because the Oculus will stop recognizing my USB 3.0. This could be a user error fault, not an Oculus fault.Thank-you for those that read this and found it helpful.

I bought the Oculus Rift S because a friend of mine had the CV1 and I loved it.  I waited until the S came out in order to get my own system.  Initially, I was pretty pleased!  The unboxing experience was pleasant.  I enjoyed the smell of a new electronic, and all of the material used to make the Rift S seemed great.  I downloaded and installed both Oculus and Steam VR.  They both worked pretty well as in they both installed and launched correctly.  It seemed like it ran great the first hour of use.  Afterward, I noticed my sound cutting out.  I was using it's auxiliary port for headphones due to the stock headphones being really, really bad.  I looked online and tried about everything that was reasonable.  Updated USB drivers, set power settings, disabled certain sound inputs/outputs, unplugged other USB devices, ETC.  It got to the point where I thought, ""Wow, I just spent $400 on a gaming system and I have to tweak everything just to get sound to work.""  I then tried disconnecting the stock sound and leaving my initial sound.  It's easy!  There's a small 2.5mm jack underneath the face sheath that's very simple to unplug.  No big deal!  As soon as I tried booting everything back up (I unplugged everything beforehand) I got nothing but sound.  No display, just black.  I tried the usual 'restart Oculus service' to no avail.  I then checked my three connections--hdmi to headset, hdmi to computer, usb to computer.  I got some static, tried it again, then it just booted the displays and set it on a loading screen.  Tracking didn't work at all, so I decided to run the Oculus.exe again and ran the repair option.  7gb downloaded and installed again for nothing!  It had the same exact issue as before.  I even plugged the stock 2.5mm sound input back in, so it was as if nothing changed. Tried everything again!  Nothing.  Seriously, I spent $400 on a device that I got MAYBE 8 hours out of and I've probably spent more time adjusting it than I have enjoying it.  I've read a few similar reviews and was leery.  I'm returning it, don't waste your money.  Either save for a QUALITY VR system like the Index or just get a cheaper used system.Bottom line:  It's far too pricey considering how much adjusting you have to do.  It's a great system when it works.  (A lot of people have issues with it working.)

I've only had it for a few days. Purchased for my sons 16th birthday (8-2 ) so far, so good. He hasn't stopped playing! For anyone giving negative complaints because there's won't work with whatever they have, READ THE REVIEWS and questions! It's not the companies fault. If you can't take 20 minutes to read about something and do a little research for something  that costs hundreds of dollars before you purchase that's your own fault. I even purchased a cord and adapter (didn't end up needing) just Incase since some reviews said they needed one. One thing about this is you need space. Not a lot (you draw your moving space for the game) but the more space the better. We moved the room around a bit but this is working great so far and so much fun! I'll update with anymore info as time goes on since it's only been a few days but my son is amazed by it so far!

I have played quite a bit within this headset in the past few months, and I can confidently say it’s been worth every dime. I may only have a narrow hallway to play it in, in terms of play space, but the tracking is surprisingly accurate for a large portion of your body. Of course behind the back is a blind spot, but you won’t notice it if you aren’t playing a game like VR Chat were you can see your avatar’s hands freeze behind your back. It terms of fitting, the term “one size fits all” can be applied to everything except the IPD adjustment. I believe the minimum is 59mm and the max is ~70mm, but it is software adjusted so it can be less than optimal for some. (Works fine for me as I’m around 69-70) Controllers are fine, but I’ve heard they are really small for people with very large hands, unlike the Vive. The biggest complaint I have with it so far is the lack of ability for good body tracking. Of course the Kinect exists, but for god’s sake don’t turn around in real life or you’ll look like someone twisted your spine and your legs separately like a matryoshka doll. Other than that, the only other full body option (at the time of this review) is to buy oculus/Vive lighthouse trackers and the subsequent full body tracking nodes. (Which is Very Expensive and not worth the effort if you could just buy a Vive) in short, good headset, but if you want full body, get a Vive or a valve index.

Would I recommend this? No. Save your money and by something better.Why 3 stars them? I do love using my Rift s.What I hateI frequently have to restart the oculus software for varying issues including but not limited toThe screens not turning on.Almost every time I go to use it I have to restart the software to get the screens to even turn on. This sometimes can take upwards of 5 restarts.Hands getting stuckFrequently I have an issue where the tracking fails and my digital hands get stuck in whatever relative location to my head they were in when the tracking failed. The will also make everything around you in game get stuck at the relative distance from you it was at.Tracking only works in a ceartain rangeThis is probably expected but you don't have any camera tracking behind you so anything behind you is no go.It's uncomfortableThis is true in many waysEven with the bands used in the recommended way the face part is too close and without pulling it nearly all the way out it will rub my cheeks raw in more intense games (don't know if this is somehow my fault but it's still a complaint)The lack of IPD adjustment while wasn't a massive issue it did irritate me enough to mentionThe built in speakers are terrible.I was lucky, I happened to have a pair of headphones that just managed to fit over the band. If you don't then you'll be stuck with two options, use the built in ones (this was absolutely a no for me as I bought it with content creation in mind) or buy a pair that work with it.All in all if I could return this and buy a better option I probably would.Why can't i?Well for a couple reasons one I think is why you'll buy this anywaysI don't have the money even with a refund to just turn around and buy a more expensive option at the moment.The mic a bought has an adhesive part that I stuck to it and I don't I'll get that off.RegardlessIf you are looking for option at this price range and no higher then yeah I would say consider this. However, if you're even remotely capable /willing to save for a bit longer and buy an option with better tracking and less issues then I highly recommend you do that

I can't fault this product, This is my first try at the world of VR, and I must say its amazing. The Oculus was easy to setup, and get going. It even did a firmware update and off I go. Just one problem, Motion sickness, this is of cause not the fault of the product, but my brain not knowing why my eyes are saying I am moving forward but my legs are not moving. My friends tried the VR headset and had no problems. So just a heads up for those who get motion sickness easily to maybe try it out before buying if at all possible. Also note it depends on the game. Check out YouTube about VR comfort levels.

This is my first VR head set and I have to say what it's an experience. Everything looks awesome! I watch some reviews about the sound not being that good but the sound is fine to me. It's very easy to use and to understand. Now for the cons. I get real sweaty real quick in the visor and the lens fog up. The Mic is so sensitive that people in VR Chat complain about hearing my heavy breathing but i dont breath heavy. I have to unplug/replug the USB from my pc often because it will read as disconnected. The sensors field of view needs some work. If the controls are just by the side of my leg, my arm in the game either won't move or goes haywire. Other than those I enjoy very much so.

The headset only works about a quarter of the time. More often than not, I see a black screen, and the only way to fix it is to unplug and plug the headset back in anywhere from one to five times to get it to work.Any time the headset is not in use for 30 minutes or more, I have to unplug and plug the headset in anywhere from one to five times to get it to work.Any time I restart my computer, I have to unplug and plug the headset in anywhere from one to five times to get it to work.Lastly, the batteries for the handheld controllers only lasted for about two hours of use.

Love playing on the headset but there is a weird bug that I tried to contact customer support for. Every time I power up my PC, the headset is not recognized so I have to manually unplug and replug in my wires every time I want to play. After customer support gave me a bunch of things to try to fix this, nothing was working. Each time I responded to them, it would take a couple days or maybe even a week in some instances for them to get back to me. In the time it took me to go through all of the suggestions by support, my window for returning the product had closed which they did not care 1 bit. As the issue persisted after trying everything that was suggested, they then promised to send me a new wire in the hope that it would solve the problem. This was the last email they sent to me and now after months have passed with no wire, they refuse to respond. I even called and they referenced an open case saying they could not help as someone else was working on it. Definitely the worst customer service experience I have ever had which sucks because the headset is actually fun to play.

I have a very expensive machine, has the required graphics card, yet doesn't have the display port. Hence it doesn't work.  Shouldn't need to buy a new $2000 machine to use a VR headset.  Also, once you take the time to look at the games offered by oculus they appear to be very basic and would get boring quick once the novelty wears off.  Probably just get a playstation.

After reading reviews I decided to jump into the VR world with this headset.  Boy what a mistake.  I have an RTX 3070, 24 GB of Ram and an i7-7700K @ 4.2GHz.  So my system is over kill for VR.This headset was nothing but problems.  The display port would randomly stop working, the controllers would just continue to disconnect and I had set up my headset from scratch like 3 times in just over 3 hours.  I was able to play maybe three games of Beatsaber and constantly crashed SteamVR when I tried to play Halflife: Alyx.I was so excited for this headset and I don't even know if I will bother with VR again.I do not suggest this headset. If I get a new one, I will just pick up the Steam system.

Absolutely incredible experience. I'm speaking as a VR-newcomer, haven't owned any other VR before this (well i tried one of the things you stick your phone in). I received it yesterday, installed it, and waited impatiently (took about 45 minutes to install), and then went on the journey of a lifetime. I cannot get over how cool this thing is. I stood on tall buildings, floated in zero-g, and ducked as a giant Tyrannosaurus roared over my head. Both my mother-in-law and my wife tried it and had the same reaction - ""WOW"".My experience wasn't perfect, i had a little ""jitter"" from time to time on the display, and had to reboot twice to turn the headset back on after the screen going blank. That said, it is still an incredible piece of tech and leaps and bounds ahead of where I thought we were technologically.If you are on the fence, and have the PC to run it, buy it. It is just that cool.

I had the Oculus Rift + touch + 3 sensors for a full 360º experience. It's nice but uses lots of USB ports (1 USB 3.0 for the headset, 2 USB 3.0 for 2 sensors + 1 USB 2.0 for the third sensor). Adding keyboard, mouse any any other device you have, you are out of ports. Got this Rift S and sold my old Rift with 3 sensors. Problem solved. No more sensors hanging on the walls, USB thick cables going up and down, I no longer need an USB hub for my devices. It tracks just fine, no glitches. The headset is heavier but not that much. ""Screen"" resolution has a small upgrade (this alone would never justify an upgrade). The camera also lets you seed your surroundings without removing the headset and that is great. The software also has a good upgrade, more friendly and easier to set your grid.

So this thing is really cool, not needing extra sensors setups is great for various play areas.The software works, but sometimes needs too much care from the user to keep working. Updates seem to have fixed some of this. Most issues can be resolved by restarting the Oculus VR service, and/or rebooting your computer. There are too many other random issues to list here, but all where fixed and I could continue to play, eventually. Again pain to troubleshoot sometimesFinally do not buy this unless your machine passes the minimum specs because they intentionally built their software to block use on hardware that does not meet their standards.

I've only ever used PSVR and there is no comparison. The ease of setup is better, you only need have 1 cord whereas the PSVR there was 6, the camera, and breakout box. The quality of screen is better to the point where I can't count each individual pixel like I could with PSVR. The tracking obviously better since it has 5 cameras instead of only 1. The only thing I prefer on the PSVR was the comfort and fit. The foam material used in the rift s felt scratchy and made my nose itch constantly. I'm also not a fan of the halo band it prevents me using any of my headphones. If oculus or a third party were to make some aftermarket head bands and facial masks then it would be the perfect vr headset for me.

With less than 60 hours of use over a course of just about three and a half months, the system has become unusable. It was always buggy and unreliable about detecting your movements as well as the location of the floor (nothing better than it randomly deciding the floor is ten feet above your head), but tolerably so. When it is working, it can be a lot of fun and is a great and novel experience to enjoy. That said, it is now a very expensive paperweight as the headset is completely and utterly unresponsive. For a product of this price to become unusable through normal use so quickly is a disgrace, and I would highly recommend avoiding this product.Support was frustrating to work with at first, but eventually has pulled through for me and is offering to replace my faulty product. If that manages to last for more than a handful of weeks, I'll be pleasantly surprised.

It appears there is a common issue with  Rift S screens going black soon after start up, OR during installation.In my case, the headsets video feed did not function during the initial set up phase, and remained completely black. the audio did however work.Using occulus comparability check, my hard ware is confirmed to be compatible, and i recieved green checkmarks during the set up to continue in the installation phase.I scoured reddit for fixes to the problem, but the solutions are ""dodgy"" at best, and are generally inconclusive.i updated my motherboard bios, updated windows 10 OS to the latest version, updated my GPU firmware and drivers. used the ""repair"" option in the occulus applicaitoni made sure all my usb 3.0 ports were active, and even bough a PCI-E USB 3.0 adapter incase my motherboard usb ports were the issue.i made sure my windows camera settings were toggled correctly, tired waiting after plugging in the USB before plugging in the video cord.im running a nvdia 1070 FTW edition by EVGA.Reddit, and the popular ""Virtual Reality"" discord server report similar black screen issues across multiple users with  one common thread ; from the 1060 to the 1080, 10 series video cards tend to have this black screen issuethis is not an isolated incidentwith inconclusive ""fixes"", ranging from backdating nvdia drivers, and re-fixing the video cord to the faceplate of the headset.until a firmware update addresses these black screen issues (which are not unique to me), this review will remain a 3 star.

Bought a while back. The kids and I love it, its a lot of fun and the rift s utilizes cameras instead of sensor bars which is a great feature.  The only and biggest downside, and why I will be getting rid of this one and looking into the vive or index, is that facebook will require you to log in. I don't want to have to log in to play the games I bought already, and I don't like that if you permanently delete your FB account you will permanently lose all your games.

I have had the headset for about 2 week's now and have had a lot of fun with it. Before I got the head set I did make sheer my PC could use it and that my IPD would work with this.  I have played a few game's with it and game's like Elite Dangerous in VR blew my mind. Watching 3D movie's using Big Screen VR (it's Free) is better then what I have seen in the theaters.The headset is conferrable for long use and the screen door effect is there but only something you well see if your looking for it.

Share the headset with my grand children. They very much like these for gaming. I use for some gaming, but more for watching videos or other apps. 5K video is wonderfully realistic. It struggles with 8K, but that may be my 5700xt video card or maybe a driver issue. I find the controllers awkward with some games. Moving from my pc to my grand kids pc usualy requires a minute or two running device set up.

I have the CV1, GO and the S. Love this headset, we use it so much, sweat in it so much, have fun in it so much. I even designed a set of Beatsaber handles for it. my favorite electronic device in the home. search ebay for ""beat saber oculus custom"" I never play without them and now only play expert/expert+ modes.

Disgusted!!!! This expensive item was shipped to us after the first one we bought didn't work and we had to exchange for a new one. This, is the replacement we were sent. Filthy! Hair, greasy and sticky finger prints, ripped box, thrown together in dirty box as if they didn't care. This is absolutely a used item and I will be returning it! To receive an item that goes on your hand, face/head/eyes during the Covid19 pandemic in this condition is an absolute horror. Especially for the hundreds of dollars we paid and to already be disappointed by the first one not working. Highly recommend steering clear from purchasing from here! Highly disappointed and disgusted to say the least.

I came over from Odyssey+ ( hated the short cord, when upping cord it wacks out audio, left speaker had issues, was a nightmare), while not as high of a FOV and resolution as the Odyssey it certainly looks good, and I like how it has 5 cameras with passthrough vs odysseys 2.  The tracking works very well and will come along way in replacing external sensors and allow the masses to get into VR easier.  I really like the controllers, they fell very good in your hands.  I had a few issues with controllers randomly leaving my hands and moving into ground, I updated a few drivers and it seems to be fine now.  A lot of reviews are giving bad stars because this has no HDMI?  It clearly states it is displayport, anyone who gives 1 star because of this should be ashamed and is a part of everything that is wrong with Amazons rating system.So after about a month with this VR setup I was considering returning it.  The controllers are going out enough times (maybe once or twice a night of game play, typically boxvr or beatsaber, so very active)  that the only way to quickly fix the issue would be to restart oculus.  I put in a support ticket and I setup a Beta public test and got an update, been playing another day or two and I no longer seem to have the issue.  They are aware of the issues and seem to be making quick attempts to resolve the issues.

I bought this to replace my first gen rift setup and happy that I did. The graphics are just a touch better but man was it nice to box up the external sensors and extra cables wrapped around the room. The rock solid stability is a nice change, I barely used the 1st gen system because tracking loss was a huge problem. The added passthrough video feature was a nice touch, too.I did consider the Quest but would rather deal with being tethered to my pc than be at the mercy of the limitations of a built-in rechargable battery.

Are the visuals better!? YES BUT the tracking is absolutely horrible especially in gun games like onward. If you put the dominate hand to close to face it loses tracking. No cameras point directly down. Sending it back and waiting on valve index. wanted SO BAD to keep it bc i have the original Rift and wanted to keep knuckle controllers but tracking is just a COMPLETE joke

Positive feedback - I have been using the RiftS for a few months now, What I have discovered is when it works right its a good experience. I generally do not play for hours due to motion sickness eventually catching up with me, more details later. When the frame rates are stable I can get in a game of beat saber, etc or walking adventure game for a little bit without issues and its a an immersive fun experience. Its not to heavy on your head or neck and the guardian system is an adaptable boundary system for different size rooms. Some games play better with larger boundaries than others.Negative Feedback - Here is the issues I have run into, its a resource intensive device. I have a fairly powerful PC setup. I can run most modern games at high or ultra settings.  My system has 48GB of ram, 1080 TI graphics card, i7 CPU for a rough baseline. More often than not though I have shut down everything but the VR stuff and hope it runs smoothly with no lag or input delay. Once that starts happening the time frame depending on the game, as it always happen eventually even on low quality settings.  I am then forced to take a break from the system as it triggers a motion sickness that means I have sit down for a little afterwards. If this was a once in a while thing it would be a minor issue but when it happens every session eventually where the game or games will just lags/skips frames and becomes unplayable.Conclusion - As it currently stands this is fun device to use when its working correctly, but until it gets to the point when it doesn't max out my graphics ram and CPU usage (I tracked this) its an expensive toy at this point I occasionally play, fun to play but not a must buy item if your on the fence. If you have money to burn and want to play around in VR and posses a good gaming PC you will have fun, on the other hand if this is already stretching you budget maybe wait for a newer more reliable model to release or improvements come elsewhere in the gaming sphere that fix some of these issues.

I ordered the Rift S after my original Rift stopped working properly, and I must say I'm very satisfied- the image on the Rift S is a lot sharper and cleaner than it is on the original Rift, the ""glazing"" problem that was with the · Rift is no longer an issue, and the fogginess of the Rift S in cold condition is a lot less severe than it used to be on the Oculus Rift.· Sometimes the Rift S does have some problems with the software, as it suddenly only tracks head movement(360) and not direction(which is my only problem with the Rift S), but those things are getting fixed as time passes.· The price tag is awesome, I did not notice the refresh rate difference between the Rift and the Rift S.· On the original Rift, I used the highest IPV possible, at first it was a bit weird with the lower IPV- but after an hour of playtime, it felt natural.

While hearing negative reviews from others, i found this device to exceed my expectations. The passthrough camera is quite a nice touch and the boundary doesn't need to be reset nearly as often as i was told to be necessary. The controllers do lose tracking if they go behind your back but only if they stay there for more than 3 seconds or so as the predictive tracking works better than anticipated and most games don't require your hands to go behind your back too often or for too long in the first place. The camera's work decent enough in low-light situations but it's advised to be in a well lit area without too much direct light to the cameras. Overall the only thing this is missing is a full-body tracking mechanism to complete the package and it would be perfect.

Returned the first Rift S after the firmware update pricked the unit. Amazon's return process was fantastic, replaced within two days of request. Second go-around was flawless.Resolution is everything I hoped it would be.  I do wish it was lighter, but it's only 2020, can't have everything. Looks a lot better than the CV1 it replaced. Humid breathing is kept out much better than the CV1 as well. THe old unit would fog up and you'd have to wait a while for the HMD to warm up and unfog.Overall just better.

I bought this headset after having the CV1 for 2 years. I have to say that this oculus S in an underrated VR headset. I red some reviews that say that the oculus S isn’t an update over the CV1 and I have to disagree. For me it’s definitely a nice upgrade..I like the new halo design..very comfortable and I felt it’s even lighter than the CV1.... great sweet spot and  I noticed immediately a superior resolution specially with SS-1.5. The SDE is less and less noticeable. The image more clear and you can see better the small details. I use it exclusively with my motion sim racing cockpit . The only 2 negative aspects are the audio quality and here I have to WTF? You can barely hear anything but fortunately I ordered PSVR audio headset from Amazon and it fits perfectly with the oculus S. Overall I like this new oculus rift S and it really a nice step ahead of the CV1 and with 350$ and free shipping to my county I would say It’s a great deal.

While I do love the headset I have notice an obvious problem compared to my Index my daily driver monitor that ive been using for the last few years is a 144hz panel and unfortunately if you are some who is used to that on a monitor it become significantly easier to become nations while wearing the headset while I still love the rift s i cant wear it for long periods of time just due to how easy it is to get sick for me my recommendation is that if you've never really played on a high refresh rate monitor you should be fine while 4/5 people will still experience motion sickness. The refresh rate will heavily impact how quickly you do get sick while in VR. headsets like the index while more expensive do offer a refresh rate that will allow considerably longer sessions. However Using the Oculus Desktop app I found to be incredible and could for the most part watch you tube, Netflix and amazon in VR for long periods of time since the screens in vr are for the most part capped at 60hz regardless so if your some who would want to take advantage of using your desktop in vr this is still the headset for you.

This headset was my first entry into VR, and my experience has generally been positive. Setup is very simple, the headset and controllers are light and well designed, ergonomically speaking, and the image quality is decent with a fairly large and easy-to-maintain ""sweet spot"".Oculus offers a robust variety of games on its store, and the system gets along well with Steam VR.The inside-out tracking seems to be implemented very well, with only occasional drift or loss of location from which the headset recovers quickly.Like many others, I do wish for a hardware IPD adjustment. That said, my own IPD is 72mm - at the upper end of the range provided by the software solution on the Rift S - and I'm able to get a good, clear image that does not leave me feeling cross-eyed and nauseated. So, if your main concern about the Rift S is IPD, that may be less of an issue than you think.

The Oculus Rift S is incredible. I’ve never played VR before this and wasn’t sure what to expect. Once I tested it at a friends house, I was hooked, and ordered one right then. When it arrived, I just had to wait for the installation to complete, and was given a glowing introduction to what is still a mesmerizing experience. It’s hard to put into words how awesome it is to use and get lost in.The only cons I had were when it would give me an incompatible USB port error, I had to spent 25 dollars on an expansion card to get rid of it. And after that, it still wouldn’t work with Steam VR, which oculus themselves said wasn’t their issue as it wasn’t their product. Pretty dismissive, but I was able to ignore (aka mute) the error message and am still able to play and experience things normally.Oculus, find a way to work closely with Steam VR to iron out the constant crashes and bugs, and this will make it a 5 star product to me. Until then, I’m amazed, but could see improvement in that department.Overall, if you have the right setup, this will be great for you!

Starting off with a disclamer.  If you don't already have a decent gaming PC Look into the Oculus Quest Its this price but everything is included.  That said if you already have a decent gaming pc this will give you access to steam vr without buying an additional cable, and it will be a little better quality.  For me without spending over $1000 for the next best Vr headset this matched my budget (already had a good pc) and allowed me access to the VR games I had on steam already.  I have access to Oculus store and steam so my games library is already pretty robust.  To make this work because it does have a cord connected at all times to the computer I did put a ceiling wire management system up.  Could not recommend this enough to someone with a gaming rig already.

The Oculus Rift S is, in my opinion the best headset on the market when it comes to price versus performance.ProsWith a great looking display, you pretty much never notice the screen door effect, and a rather high FOV for a consumer headset it feels more immersive. The controllers work well, especially so since it is an inside out tracking headset  (The headset has cameras to track the controllers, rather than sensors you place on the wall or floor, etc.) I would highly recommend getting this if you have a midrange or better PC.ConsThere are no back cameras and the cameras have some small dead ones which causes the controllers to lose tracking occasionally but it is rarely an issue. The software required to use the headset is buggy and often requires restarting as soon as you launch it, and unplugging the headset occasionally. I personally could not get the headset to work when I overclocked my GPU.ClosingThe headset is a great value for 400$. If you’re interested in VR I highly recommend this headset over others due to the price, performance and comfort levels.

My only complaint is that they replaced the HDMI connection with the display port. This can be a real problem unless your system supports it. It was actually cheaper for me to buy a small modern computer then to upgrade my video card. I picked up a low-cost MCI machine which works perfectly for this application. I have several VR headsets and I use this one as replacement for my rift. The inside-out tracking is a worthwhile replacement for the lighthouses. It saves on USB ports.

I have waited some time to let Oculus release patches before i write my simple review.PROS:►Price point, being my first VR headset i still think this is a very good entry level VR system.►Ease of setting up, being new to VR it was surprising convenient to set up.►Screendoor effect hardly noticable. It was one of my main concerns before buying this.►Tracking issues mostly resolved by patch 1.39, the controllers occluding each other and losing tracking if too close to the headset had improved immensely.►80 hz is okay. I was actually skeptical at first since im that kind of guy who notices the slightest frame drops since i was playing on a 144hz monitor for so long. But 80hz is fine and i even dip lower than that since i mod my main VR games.►Passthrough is a nice addition.►ASW 2.0 doing wonders for heavy modders and customers with mid tier PC setup.CONS:►Speaker quality is subpar. reminds me of my first ever phone that could play music. Not having a headphone sitting on my ear is good for immersion, but the execution by Oculus was extremely poor. Valve index seems to implement this better.►Speakers causing my display to shut off and or cause constant frame drops on games like beat saber. Solution is to either use headphones or use desktop speaker. It is regrettable that they still havent fixed this. will update my review when or if its been patched.►IPD might cause problems for other people, I honestly somehow dont notice a difference when i change the IPD, i might be a mutant or something but ive read people definitely being affected by this.►Resolution was compromised. Such a letdown, a missed opportunity to consider this a 2.0 Rift. Methinks its a sign they are saving the higher resolution for an actual 2.0 Rift. fingers crossed.Overall despite the issues im still verry happy with this, i wish they could fix the display shutting off bug soon. What i dont understand about other reviews here is that they keep on complaining about it only having displayport. It clearly stated in the specifications. Do your research before you go buying stuff, it even had a tool to check if your system is ready. Worth a buy as entry level or if you want a cheaper and decent alternative to HTC or Valve index. If you can afford the index and have the PC specs to maximize its full potential then that would be a better choice for you. If you want an easy to setup, good value for money PCVR then this would be your choice.

When it works it's awesome.  It track very well.  The problem is about every 15 minutes - 1 hour the controllers stop tracking because the pass through camera just stops working.  Oculus support has been ignoring that this isn't an isolated problem.  So there's that.  Kinda kills the fun when you have to restart and unplug and replug in your Oculus every 30 minutes.  Support had me reinstall everything and sent me a new cable.  The problem actually got worse with a new cable. **Edit** after software updates and a new unit I no longer have this issue. Changing to 4 stars because it really is a great product.

I'd like to start off my review with my experiences with VR. Before I bought this product I had tried the HTC Vive and spent a full day using a Windows Mixed Reality headset. ( I borrowed it from a friend to use for a day)  What I found the most frustrating with that headset was that games often didn't have support for the controllers and that I would need to adjust the headset quite a lot for the images to become none blurry. (This is what people refer to as finding the ""Sweet Spot"")  Another problem I had was that images were blurry and it made it difficult to read words in VR.Amazingly with this headset, it's easy to use. Just plug in two wires and you're ready to go. When fitting on the headset you will not have to shuffle around trying to find your sweet spot. The resolution on the headset is pretty good too. I""m able to read words or letters in a game without a problem. It's amazing for its price in comparison to more expensive headsets.The controllers are also quite sturdy in my opinion. Accidentally whacked it at the wall a few times and still haven't found any issues. The sensors on the controllers are amazing as they can detect different hand gestures such as fist, finger pointing and thumbs up.Regarding the issues that other people have had with VR ready laptops not being able to use it. It seems like people are often not reading what is included in the box. There is an adapter for the HDMI cable. Just make sure you have a mini display port on your laptop.For the reason why I decided to give it 4 stars, not 5 stars.  Is because the strap on the headset is quite big and uncomfortable to lay down in or to use when sitting back against a chair. In comparison to the Quest. But overall I'm pretty happy with my headset. Easy to set up and use or even put away when you're finished using it. If you have any questions for me please feel free to ask away ! :)

Wanted to leave an actual review, as someone who has actually received the headset.  If you are on the fence about buying this, as of today (5/24, 3 days after launch) some people have been having issues with the headset. I am not one of those people. For me it has worked perfectly. I've only had the opportunity to play it for an hour, but setup went perfectly, and it's truly an amazing product. I can 100% recommend this headset to any VR newcomers with a relatively strong pc.  I would however caution you to wait maybe a week, or at least long enough for Oculus to roll out a software update to fix some of the issues.  I'll update this review if I come across any of the bugs or issues other buyers have been having. By the way, my ipd is somewhere between 61.5-63 mm, and I find the sweet spot fits my eyes perfectly.

Had my rift s for about a year. Controllers easily smashed and split in half with one drop, and to buy a new controller you need to buy one from scalpers for 200$ each.

The headset itself is very high quality. But Facebook has acquired Oculus, and they have slowly been pushing their agenda into Oculus. One has to make a Facebook account to use this. I wouldn't be surprised if they mine all your data. I don't trust it.The onboard cameras are excellent at detecting your position and the position of the hand sticks, high refresh rate and screen resolution, instant responsiveness. The Guardian system protects you from bumping into things and it mostly works, but it doesn't  always work well when you move backwards.

At first take, out of the box its breathtaking. If you ONLY PLAY VR games it might be fine. The one dedicated VR game I have works fine. It's a little grainy but it works ok. We had some fun with it. The problem is regualr 2d games with VR support. This thing is a brick on those games. I spent over 18hrs messing with it to run DCS and it still looks like shit. Any other games that use VR mods to give you vr? It aint gonna work. You had better be up on your computer hacking skills to make anything like those work and they will be glitchy, grainy, laggy and distorted. I realize thats a software issue and not a hardware issue but the amount of true VR games is limited and if you think you will just pop on VORPX or a R.E.A.L. mod for GTA you are sadly mistaken. This is a 400dollar mistake I made. I wish I could send it back. Honestly. I would right now.

I loved the fact that as soon as I got it I just had to install the oculus software and plug the headset in. This is a plug and play as it gets for a PC powered VR headset. The only downside that I have noticed is that when I have my hands down at my sides sometimes the tracking fails which is annoying in games like beat saber. The fix for this issue I think would be to purchase one of their external sensors however, it seems as though they do not support external sensors which is annoying. Overall great but could use some external sensors.

I decided after a few years it was time to revisit VR to see where it's gotten to.I have a DK2 collecting dust in the basement due to its vomit inducing experience.While it isn't perfect I can gladly say VR is finally consumer ready. Unlike in the past set up was minimal and get a game running involves putting the headset on and pointing at the game you want to play.I'm happy to see VR becoming more consumer friendly that I ever expected it to be.

This headset works wonderfully. If you have never tried VR but can't/don't want to spend 1000+ dollars buying the index and upgrading your PC to the high end, this is the way to go. Of course, if your PC isn't powerful enough for this (minimum specs say even a 1050ti would work) and you don't have the money to upgrade, go with the Quest, though for pure performance and graphical quality (as well as better tracking) the Rift S is the way to go.

I moved to this after having an HTC Vive for a year, and this is eons better. The lack of base stations makes setup and moving around much easier. I though I would miss the Vive's OLED screen, but I can see things so much better with the higher resolution screen that it doesn't make a difference. The halo strap design is super easy to adjust with the knob at the back. All of my SteamVR games are compatible too.

I purchased the Oculus Rift S after using a Dell Visor (Windows Mixed Reality) for about a year.  I consider the Rift S to be a major step forward.  It's super comfortable and fits similar to a PSVR.  The picture is clear, the software is easy to navigate and the controllers are spot on.  It all comes down to the games for me and the Rift S (along with my I7 PC with 1070) runs everything smoothly.  I had a ton of problems with WMR, my Rift S has been running like a dream.

This has been an excellent product to introduce me to VR, because of the ease of setup and simple UI of the oculus app, which I really appreciate. I plugged in the headset, slotted the batteries in the controller, ran an update and was ready to go with some pre loaded introduction environments. I’ve had an amazing time with this and the clarity of the new monitor is beautiful, even with the drop in FPS. Unfortunately, despite the easier setup, having the sensors built into the headset has proven to be an interesting concept. I loved not worrying about base stations and sensors, but it seems to be making parts of games unplayable, for example, shooting a bow and arrow is not smooth or accurate, and has resulted in some frustration, as well as super hot VR having some temporary glitches with controller tracking, where my hand seems to continue in the direction I moved it for a couple seconds, before snapping around and returning to its correct position.Overall, I would recommend this product for newcomers to VR, and probably for more experienced users as well, since the tracking seems to be fixable with a software update

Worked for 2years then the cord took a crap. And I'm not paying  $180 for a new one. I will buy a different product first. Unless someone makes it right. And I should  add we did not use it very much and I take care of my stuff. So it wasn't abused.

As a VR headset, this thing is almost perfect. I rarely have issues with it losing tracking on my controllers. It looks great (video quality) and is very comfortable.However there are some things I wish I would have known before hand. To start off, not all motherboards are compatible! I spent many hours hours troubleshooting, attempting fixes, and on hold with their chat support. Nothing I did seemed to make it work. I came to the conclusion that it was a problem with the USB of the motherboard. The drivers my motherboard used seemed incompatable (and yes, I updated them). We got it to work perfectly in my brothers PC. Oculus actually had a compatibility scan that will tell you if you meet the required specs (not any more). The only solution for me was upgrading the motherboard, after that, everything ran smooth as can be.These next two are minor issues (for me). The controllers dont come built in with rechargable batteries, and the audio is rather quiet (as of now, I hear they are working on an update). The headset does come with a 3.5mm headphone jack on the side, but I find earbuds to be the only comfortable audio solution. Headphones simply dont work very well with the strap design.To summarize, the built in speakers are quiet (at this time) but you can use earbuds or a headset to fix the sound quality. And the controllers require AA batteries to function. Other than that, it does everything it should with few problems.

The visuals are acceptable with scan-lines effects or screen-door but the major issue are the controllers which keeps bugging me for the last 12 times a day to reset them. Maybe it is the lighting or the error of many applications... What is up with the grainy screens and frozen controllers? Plus, what is up with the unplugging the headset over and over again for many times?

His may not be the fault of the Oculus since I have owned the Oculus DK2 for some time and love it but it seems when I order these kinds of items from Amazon this has been happening to me. Last time it was a $260 pair of binoculars that came used and out of alignment. When I order a New product I should not be sent a return which is what this was.

My old HTC Vive broke a couple months ago and I was looking to replace it with the Cosmos but I happened to find this amazing thing back on the market for well under half the price tag with Index controller support on steam vr. I decided I'd go for the Rift S and man! This thing is actually better than the old HTC Vive and for $200 cheaper than what I paid then. I will say the tracking isn't perfect since the station tracking is built into the headset, BUT if you're in a smaller room the tracking is all you need to be able to move perfectly in vr. Overall this was the best decision I made as a replacement purchase.

I heard that the rift S wasn't a huge upgrade. BULL!!! I owned a gen 1 rift and I can tell you this newer headset eliminated all of the frustrations of the gen1 model. Massive improvements in all areas, comfort, sensors, guardian system, no more screen door, smoother, clearer, better response, easier to put on, less cords, etc. Over all it was a MASSIVE improvement over gen1. I guess the critics out there never fully engaged with the the original rift or they would have understood how huge of an upgrade this was.

I had hoped that I was going to be able to run the RIFT S off of my laptop that meets all of the Recommended Requirements- HA!....nope.  Apparently the USB-C is tied to the processor buss- not the GPU...this will not work; after spending the afternoon researching this ""pertinent detail"" afterward I feel cheated.  The RIFT was detected by my GPU setup suite, however it would not start/drive the Headset....as it was off of the integrated video on the processor.If the desktops cannot interface with this- (I hope they can, they too meet the Recommended Requirements), I will be returning the doorstop.  If they do work, I may bump my rating up....so far buyer beware.

These are Amazing VR! The quality is superb and the fact that they have a headphone jack built in really helps keep cords under control.

Good Headset to get into VR. But don't expect accurate tracking of the handset. There is noticeable latency between movements and it actually showing up in game. Cord also gets in the way, however, there isn't anything the average consumer can do about that without a ceiling rig.When I bought this, it seemed good, however as time went on, the lower quality plastic on the controllers started to show through. My left hand controller is on the verge of breaking on the ringed portion, and I have only owned it a month with moderate use. They should be built to last, not just look good. I assume the tracking issues lie in the actual handsets as costs couldn't have been cut more. A positive is they are very light, so your wrists do not get tired.The headset is comfortable enough for one of the lowest end VR's you can buy. No problems as of yet. Very happy with the 3 adjustments you can make on it to fit.TL;DRI would recommend this, but keep the receipt.

First of all, we bought this headset originally from Walmart, being the only place that had it in stock at the time. At first, things were great. After a day or two, NOTHING BUT CONNECTION ISSUES! USB connection wasn’t working, DisplayPort either, then I’ve had enough and decided to return it. After deliberation, decided to buy another Rift S but from Amazon this time, seeing it was in stock. When the headset worked, it was awesome! So we gave Oculus a try. BEST DECISION EVER. Had it for about a week now, no issues whatsoever. Your headset might be defective! As long as your computer meets the specs, and make sure you plug the USB into a 3.0, works like a charm!

Literally one week after I bought this, Facebook announced that any Oculus users will be REQUIRED to have a facebook account. As someone who has refused to let Facebook rule my life, I needed to return the headset as soon as I heard.

The headset I purchased started freezing after a few months of use. This issue got worse and worse until and I reached out to Oculus to ask for a warranty repair. The told me they do not offer a repair service and directed me to their technical support. They asked me to download files which I did and then could not accept them because they are too big. They then asked me to use dropbox which I did and then told me they never received the link. I attached the link to my emails several times and then they stopped responding.

An incremental solid step-up from the prior CV1 headset.  Improved clarity, resolution and decreased ""screen door"" effect due to the new LCD screen panels.  Fits comfortably and snuggly on my head.  Great inside-out tracking of hand controllers - the best in the VR industry.  Oculus keeps improving and updating their software and firmware.

Have had no issues with the hardware itself; internal speakers are good but in some instances not loud enough. Tracking is good; used in a cockpit simulator - confined space- and Guest / VR room with recommend play area. Screen door effect is reduced significantly - in my perspective. Brightness and color gammut is fine. Overall I considered it an upgrade to the rift touch bundle - packed it up...

Wasn't worth the cost. I got in on sale for $350 and I thought VR would be a lot clearer. text wasn't that good looking. The games for VR are okay. I tried some and they are just not worth it. The common games like Super Hot and Beat saber are fun but quickly over it for me. I tried racing games which was not good in VR. One game I had major issues to work with VR and other one it seemed like it was a little slow/jittery and was bad for my eyes/unplayable. I decided to give VR one more day to change my mind and I got an error of it not being able to calculate my head movement ( my head movements worked fine but the touch controllers were not responsive) So I had enough than. Seems to be more trouble shooting than playing.TLDR: Expected better quality graphics for games and text. More time trying to get games to work with it than playing.

Setup was very rocky. Currently the headset functions great. However as a previous rift owner I'm not blown away. Oculus has a huge software issue and it's a real PITA. As far as tracking goes it features inside-out tracking which is great except when you reach behind you Or you line the controllers up( like shooting a rifle) it fits better than last gen rift did. But invest in good ear buds(yeah that's right. ) wearing a headset is near impossible. Onboard sound is speakers that arent enough to drown out the kids playing in the next room. Overall I like it. But I could live without software issues hampering my play time.

 I was really looking forward to the arrival of my new Rift S. However excitement quickly turned to disappointment as i was trying to get it set up.When trying to set up guardian, the passthrough camera was not working, showing me nothing but snow. OK. No big deal. I knew what my play area was. The big let down was when I was using the device. The controllers would stop tracking correctly after just a few minutes. I tried to capture this in the video. Basically the controllers would not track dimensionally. I could turn them and use the buttons but the controller wold be stuck in one spot till i restarted the rift completely.I've decided to return it in favor of giving the stand alone quest a try.

I never use it because it’s so glitchy. I consistently have to swap the ports it’s connected to my computer with because the oculus app doesn’t recognize my rift. I’ve spent hours on forums getting it to work... and then sometimes you just have to keep restarting your computer to make it work. It’s cool in theory, but I don’t believe The owners of oculus did any testing to make sure their product worked before selling it, and frankly, once they have your money I don’t think they care.

This was my very first VR headset in my life, and the first one I ever had the chance to try as well, and I have to say, the experience itself is just simply stunning. Putting it on the first time, seeing the Oculus intro play, things fly around you, it's just amazing, I absolutely loved it, and even to this day, I still can't have enough of it, the controls are great, controlers are very comfortable, and the resolution, while a bit low, still pretty decent. However, I have two major issues with it, but both of them could just be on my part. First of all, it's very hard to get the headset to fit correctly, and no matter what I do, if I look up in a game, it'll slide off just enough so the image becomes blurry, forcing me to re-adjust the headset every 10 - 15 minutes during gameplay. The second issue is a bit more personal, I suppose, but it's very hard to see the screen if it's all foggy from sweating / intense gameplay. Other than that, it is an amazing headset in every day possible, and I highly recommend it for everyone, especially people new to VR!

My boyfriend loves this VR headset. However, he does have a hardware issue with it. The headset itself is a more forward heavy device and starts to hurt his neck and cheekbones after awhile from all the weight that doesn't distribute itself properly.

I am a long time user of the original Oculus Rift.  I was hesitant to purchase this as I was worried it wasn't much of an upgrade.  The difference in visual quality is definitely noticable and that alone is worth the upgrade.  When you factor in no external sensors and the ability to see the environment around you when necessary it is a major upgrade.  Need to pause to reach over and grab your beverage?

After reading some of the negative reviews I doubted buying this thing, but it turned out good.Pros:1) No annoying stations and cables all across the room and being able to position youself pretty much anywhere in the room within hemlet cable's reach is a huge advantage. I saw some ppl whined about staions being better. Well, the tracking is good enough excluding some edge cases2) Picture is better, eyesight angle is wider, and, ahem, I have far less sweat using this in comp to previous oculus rift.3) New helm sits far more comfortable on my head then all the previous onesCons:1) They have programmatic tuning of distance between lenses. It doesn't work at all, so if you are not lucky enough to have default eyes you might experience problems. They will probably fix it with further software updates2) Oculus software can be a glitchy nightmare at times, if you are experiencing issues I recommend googling for a work around, I've found one on Reddit. Lately there was an update that made things sort of stable at last, but I still recomend SteamVR which works like a dream.Conclusion:Best VR you can find for the 400$, if you have more budget - wait for Steam Index with Knuckles controllers, already tried it on my job and it is going to be far ahead of everything currently present on the market.

Tried to fix this by recalibrating the sensors to no avail.

After 4 hours working with Oculus chat support I ass told a senior engineer would look into my case, and I still did not have any functionality.  Now they are talking about defective cables, and asked to have me send mine to the team working on resolution of the problem.  I provided my address, and then was told they would not provide the replacement part without me putting a payment option into their store app. It feels almost like they are trying to get information I didn't want to provide if I want to use my item.

Support is pathetic, sent them a ton of logs, performed all provided actions (typical nonsense ""try another USB"", ""update your Windows"", blabla) - all of these while they should realize that the headset worked with my PC flawlessly until it just suddently stopped doing that, nothing useful from them at all.

I had two problems with setup: I needed to use a blue (3.0 I think) USB port and I had to wait a while once it said to continue setup in the headset for anything to show up: other than three white dots. Besides those minor hiccups, setup was smooth and quick. This is the first VR setup I've owned and it's exactly what I've been hoping for. My only complaint thus far is I can't get Skyrim VR to work yet, but it's the first week of release so I'll wait.NOTE: If you want to use games from outside the Oculus store, you'll need to go into Settings-->General and then allow other programs to used the Oculus.

My Rift S is working great!  I read a lot of the review help (tech tips) and it worked for me.  It has been running smooth since.  I didn't know Windows could shut down a drive because it was given too much of a load due to set parameters (i.e. new device being introduced) which is why the Rift S would shut down after 15 seconds.  Easy fix here:  (Don't wear the headset, but have the video and USB plugged in because the Rift S senses when you put it on and Windows will shut it down) Right Click ""Windows Start"" button>Click ""Device Manager"">Expand ""Universal Serial Bus controllers"">Right click every ""Hub"" or ""Universal Serial Bus Controller"" click the ""Properties"" then click ""Power Managment"" tab and uncheck ""Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power"" box.  Repeat this for every hub and controller listed.  Make sure to click ""Ok"" and not cancel out of the window after the box is unchecked.  Restart you computer and the Rift S will stay on allowing the setup process to finish....Enjoy!

I upgraded to this from the CV1 I love how simple the setup is now, No more need for external tracking sensors having which are an eyesore and lots of cables. The inside out tracking is flawless and the resolution of the display is much better true room scale vr is amazing. I am at awe that having a screen right up to my eyeballs I can barely even see the individual pixels.

This VR headset works good. The cables seem to be in the way all the time but I did not want to go with battery power.  The safe zone setup is not clear after initial set up. The safe zone seems to move and to reset it, you have to go too many steps to reset.

I had a 3 year old computer when I updated to Rift S.  It blew the USB drives.  Just thinking my old computer needed replacing, I bought a new one.  BOOM, USB drives blew within 2 days.  I brought it back to replace it.  BOOM, USB drives blew within 3 days.  Brought that back for a refund.  I waited 2 weeks, then bought a very expensive gaming computer.BOOM, within 4 days, my USB driver is shot.  But now, my return window is gone.  What a waste of $400.

Product sold by Amazon, very fast delivery, perfect condition, great price. I am very happy with purchase. The VR works perfectly. To new buyers, do research about IPD (inter pupilary distance) and VR motion sickness as they are real issues at VR experience and Rift S does not have an hardware IPD callibration (only a software callibration). But for me, all is perfect.

I own the Original Rift, and decided to upgrade because of the Inside-out Tracking and bump to resolution. I have a minimum of desk space, and being able to get rid of the sensors (And free up USB ports in the process) was a big selling point to me. Text does appear crisper than on my original headset, but otherwise Its not a massive upgrade. I went into it understanding that this was more of a horizontal upgrade, with a few checkboxes that made sense to me.All around its a solid Unit, and if your looking for a jump in point, its a great value. Upgrading your current set? that will come down to if the upgrades make it worth it for you.I am happy with my purchaseP.S.

Oculus software is also on decent level, with wide assortment of games and tools.Good points: build quality, software, mobility (no need to install additional sensors), picture quality and really comfortable controllers.Weaknesses: 80Hz, low sound quality of build-in dynamics (no headphones), no interpupillary distance regulation.In general really worths its price!

We had high hopes for the product, until it already failed. The sensors in the device no longer function and the device will not operate. The support is absolutely horrible, they will have you do a million things and take 4 days between each response. It's absolutely the worst product support I have ever received.

The headset crashes frequently for no apparent reason. Gives multiple tracking errors every 10-15 minutes for no reason even in perfect lighting. Often the two screens flash white and black which could give someone with epilepsy a seizure.This is my replacement headset. My first had these problems within the first two weeks. This one has these problems after 1 month.The left stick has started to drift with no way to fix.Infuriating garbage, save up for a Vive or Index.

Doing away with external sensors makes installation a snap, but tracking suffers. Something I didn't know is that games are expensive, and hard to find. Anything free is a tech demo, and the Oculus store feels like a mess. Steam compatibility can be a mixed bag. I feel like for a little more I could have got a VIVE, or maybe Index? But, you get what you pay for. Oculus is a great start, but go in with low expectations.

If you've got a worthy PC (and I've been playing half life alyx on a 1060 with no issue), I prefer the RIFT S due to its lack of lighthouses and 2 cable setup. Cheaper than the VIVE and INDEX. This is going to be a better experience than a QUEST and link cable, unless you absolutely want that quest stand-alone portability.If you're looking for absolutely lowest price, consider the SAMSUNG ODYSSEY. However, I felt the price difference here was worth getting the RIFT S.

Product arrived only partially functional.  After several exchanges with customer service including sending them the logs of the unit's use, it was determined that the unit was bad and I was authorized to receive a replacement.  I was told how to repack the unit and to expect shipping information to arrive in my email.  Since then, total silence -  in spite of a reminder on my part which was also ignored.  It is notable that on each email exchange, the agents were friendly and supportive, but a different customer service agent worked with me each time.  It is clear that Oculus customer service management is a disorganized mess in spite of the best efforts of the agents who directly respond to customers.

The display is the only upgrade made to the new oculus three years after the original release. Even that comes with faults over its predecessor, such as a lower refresh rate and worse black levels. The controllers are less ergonomical, with the battery covers at risk of falling off at the slightest grip. The audio is incapable of moderate to high levels, lacking all bass. The tracking of the headset itself is fine, but the controllers are lost when up close, behind, above and below you. I really hope oculus goes back to the drawing board, because overall I think the original rift is still better. I wish I hadn’t sold it to buy this one.

This is probably one of the most rewarding purchases I have ever made. Not having used the original Rift, I can not comment on the reduced screen door effect, but compared to the Gear VR this is quite a significant improvement. I can still see individual pixels and I suspect that will be the case until small screen 8k is available cheaply. The Rift home environment is customizable and has a few things to do while a game downloads. I tried a few games over the weekend, and my favorite was Star Trek: Bridge Command. If you are a Star Trek fan, it is definitely worth a look. All on all, I am highly pleased with my purchase.

So, I bought this to use, primarily, with my flight simulators and racing games. Little did I realize that th other VR-based games would be so cool too! BeatSaber and Lone Echo are so much fun. The head tracking is perfect. The controller tracking is perfect. The gestures are awesome. ONLY PROBLEM... the speakers suck. Since the sound comes out of the headband, the sound radiates out into the room bothering those around. Either that or I have to keep it so quiet that I can barely hear in-game. Still, this thing rocks!

I am a rift user for the last six months. I love the rift but wanted something a little more portable. I was worried the tracking was going to be bad but it works well. Not as well as the external sensors but good nonetheless. Halo works well. Speakers are garbage but headphones work fine with them. I haven’t noticed the refresh drop. My only complaint would be the new style top ring controllers. The originals are far superior balance wise.

System is well more than enough to support 1080ti 64gigs RAM, but can't play for more than 20 minutes w/o some sort of screw up.

The Rift S is definitely a step up from the CV1,  but I just don't care for the new Halo headstrap system.  The first brand new unit I received had a broken tension knob.  The replacement works well,  but the tensioning knob still feels flimsy and like it the first thing that going to break on the unit.  Other than that,  the visual quality is much improved and god rays are much reduced.

So i decided to buy the rift s.Compared to my other headset the comfort and controller tracking is much better then the odyssey but the good stuff stops there.The lenses on the rift s are to small or too far away from my face and the main reason why i switched to the oculus platform {stability and better performance} was actually a step in the wrong direction.

This review is mainly for those wanting to upgrade from a oculus rift to oculus rift S if you are just getting to VR for the price and overall performance I say and you have good PC then it’s a great system.I have had the oculus rift S for 2 weeks now bought as and upgrade to oculus rift. The Display if a lot cleaner looking and text is easer to read a lot lease screen door effect the audio is just bad the PSVR style might be better for standing VR games with a lot of movement but I play mainly cockpit games like DCS, Xplane and Elite Dangerous. I also have found the after the first few weeks I’m the only one the use it the adjusting the head unit for other user is not big deal to me ether. With the oculus rift I could tilt the display on my face a little and lower eye viewing. In the oculus rift S after sometime I start to feel like my eye are straining to look slightly upwards. Over all I have Boxed up my oculus rift and will run on the oculus rift S till a better System comes out. As far as upgrading only if you want the cleaner display.

This is my first introduction to VR as I was waiting for the technology to mature a little after its first iterations.The biggest worry was quickly undone was when I did not get sick while using it; I still don’t. However, the dislike was I didn’t expect the view screen to feel like I’m looking through a periscope. I had expected the view screen to accommodate for a wider periphery. Still, the potential for virtual reality, with the little I’ve tried so far, is very promising!Now I just wish there was a larger library of video games to play with!

There are a number of common problems with this headset:-It commonly loses all tracking from the sensors and requires the displayport and usb to be reinserted.-sometimes the display port cable won't be picked up by the computer its plugged into-I had a bizarre issue where the controllers would stop tracking whenever the haptic feedback kicked in (No troubleshooting helped and this seems to be a problem few other have)-immersion breaking juddering (could be caused by a number of things including software conflict)-Near head tracking still leaves a lot to be desired (improved by public test channel)-low quality sound from headband speakersAll of these issue put together create a very unsatisfying experience and I wouldn't recommend it, but when it works, it seems to work well.

This was worth the purchase for me due to the noticeable visual clarity improvement over the original rift. I use the Rift S for the awesome art programs on the oculus platform: Quill and Medium (which can't be done on the Quest).  I also own a Quest and a wireless Vive Pro, but at the moment I mostly use the Rift S. It's a good combo of being less fiddly, good visuals, power of pc connection.However, it depends on your use case...For someone who is a new vr user and who doesn't need the power of a PC tether, then the Quest would really be the best choice for now.  It's even less faffing.If you need to bring your feet and legs into  vr, then a wireless vive pro with trackers would be better, but that's a lot of fiddling around, so I generally just use the Rift S most of the time.

Oculus said they would replace them, which they did. The new ones are doing the same thing.

After 1 month of use we had to return this. The cable that hooks into the headset would get very hot. Also the unit would intermittently work and not work. We had sensor tracking issues and various other issues.  Currently oculus is sending us another headset. Hoping it works. When the headset did work it was AWESOME! Great workout and FUN! We will see how the next headset works....

This experience was even more amazing than I anticipated. I had tried psvr and a friends first generation rift before but this new design blew those out of the water.Setting up the device only took minutes.Taking your PC and Rift S from room to room is simple with the way they have the new sensors.Be prepared to spend another $50-100 on games to enjoy. And if I may suggest, but an additional face pad or two if you plan on playing with friends. Even simple games can get sweaty.If you’re on the fence about the VR experience but think this is affordable, pull the trigger and get this. You will not be disappointed. Just make sure you have about 7’x7’ to play big games and you can play multiple games with just 4’x4’.Love my Rift S and look forward to using it a lot more in the future.

The tracking is completely off with every military shooter, for instance if you try to put a weapon on your back good luck, the sensor loses track and the arm just goes out in front of you. Also, you will have to really extend your arms fully out or the sensor will think your arms are at your hips. I wanted to like this but it needs base stations plain an simple. They should have went the route Valve Index did allowing you to use both.

Whoa! So I bought my rift s a few months ago. Played it....it was just ok...I've seen 3D content on a Sony theater headset, so I was expecting more...BUT, I never fiddled around with my graphics card (a 1080ti)...I then read up and then used the Oculus debug tool to ramp up the Pixels...to 1.5! The RIFT S looks soooooo much better. Love it. If you have a beefy PC get one. Dirt Rally 2.0....daaaannng! So much fun

This is my first VR headset. The speakers aren’t bad. The build quality is nice.The fact that it doesn’t depend on lighthouse boxes is pretty cool too.My only gripe is that there may be issues with certain VR rifle stocks. There is a bit of a screen door look, but you get used to it.

So this was my first be headset I’ve owned. Setup was super easy and tracking is fantastic. The one I got day one had a lot of technical issues that made for a very frustrating experience but now it’s been a while and they’ve managed to iron out pretty much every issue I had.  Now it’s  a fantastic cheap headset that works great even in beatsaber. Low screen door effect and good visuals overall. People complain about the software ipd adjustment but I’ve had a lot of people in this thing and no issues were found. Controllers do eat batteries though. Make sure to unplug the headset when not using it to save some power. Awesome overall 👍

Upon first start after updating everything and setting up i encountered my first bug (which has yet to repeat itself) my left hand was tracking button presses but not movement it was just frozen in place, i removed the battery then replaced and it was fine but had a short moment of panic. Also i find myself hitting the two controllers together in games where i need to reload a weapon thanks to the back ring on top of the controller. This isnt my first time experiencing vr nor long play sessions with it but it will take some getting used to compared to other options.

Alright, I'm not going factor in the controversy with Facebook and Oculus in the review but I would watch how that unfolds and keep it in consideration when buying Oculus.I have no complaints about this headset.  It is comfortable to wear for hours and the touch controllers are incredible.  The games available whether it be the Oculus store or on Steam are fun but there are only a few stand out titles.  Setup was easy and it didn't take long to stretch my VR legs.  This is a great VR headset for anybody with computer capable of utilizing it.  Price is great and I do not regret my purchase.

It doesn’t work. The tracking stops working after 2 minutes of being in VR and there is no current fix for it. To reset the tracking, you need to reset the entire headset/app. Too much of a bloody pain for something that costs $400.

It says you can wear glasses with it but thats true in the sense that glasses will fit in it.Do.Not.The glasses will slowly scratch the lenses. If youve got contacts or really shallow small glasses then you are safe.Other that that i love mine. Tried compairing it to the htc vive and the rift s is cheaper. Better picture. And has smaller, easier to use remotes. Plus since you use a display port instead of an hdmi the you dont have the headache of setting up multiple screens. And problems can usually be fixed my moving the usb or restarting oculus through task manager

If you want an entry level headset for PC VR this is the kit for you.  It's sometimes a little finicky to setup, but never a huge barrier.  Tracking is really good for an inside out headset.  Like REALLY good.  Only issue I would have is if I bopped the controller into a wall (which was entirely because of the tiny apartment I was playing in)  it would sometimes cause it to get ""stuck"" but 99% of the time self correct.  I did get a ""fuzzyness"" problem once or twice, but reseating the cords fixed it.  Screen door effect is noticable, but not bad.This is the best for the price headset imo.  If you're looking for a middle of the road between a Valve Index and google cardboard this will put you right in the sweet spot.

set up so easy its almost plug-and-play, just make sure you play in atleast dim lighting because the infrared sensors don't work so well in the dark. a desk lamp and the light from my monitor is enough for it to function correctly though,the headset itself is super comfortable but you may wanna use your own headphones/mic connection to your motherboard/ sound card because the onboard 3.5mm jack port only reads headphones but not mics, and the onboard speakers and mic are kinda trash.

I bought this for my wife for Christmas. Before purchasing I checked all the required specs and made sure to upgrade my graphics card and ram for my pc to be able to handle the requirements.When it arrived, it worked just fine. We were messing around with beatsaber and superhot. After a week though, the screen just blacked out. The rift app started claiming the 3.0 USB port is actually a 2.0. I called support and after 2 weeks of back and forth none of the solutions helped. At this point I’m looking at the reviews and kicking myself for buying this in the first place. It’s been a lot of prep and then a lot of time trying to fix this. Save yourself the hassle and get something reliable.

Everything has been great about my Oculus Rift S so far, it's everything that I've expected. It's extremely fun to use, it's comfortable even after hours of playing a game, it was fairly easy to set up, and there are many other great things about it. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because mine came with a bad cable that likes to twist itself into loops which makes it really annoying when I'm playing, but my 2 friends who got their own Oculus Rift S did not have this problem so I think I was just unlucky or I got it too early. I've also seen online that the cable can be replaced so it's not that big of a deal.

The only downside is the lackluster built in speakers (and they have made them somewhat better with a firmware patch).

Pros:1. ""relatively"" affordable2. 80hz high refresh-rate display - I don't feel any kind of dizziness so far.3. no need to set up any tracking sensor in your room.4. Cameras give you real-time image if you walk out of playing area - better safe than sorry.Cons:1. It uses cameras to track the controllers, which means it cannot track it anywhere. I experienced many times when playing games, Beat Saber to be specific, the headset loses the controller so many times, especially when you play songs in a higher difficulty.2. The cable on the headset is non-detachable. Therefore impossible to use it wirelessly in the future.3. The controller is a little slippery and feels very small for big hands.4. Not very easy to put on and off if you wear glasses.

one thing I'd like to point out before I go into context for those of you that are rating this product 1 star just because you don't have the right port you need to stop. There's a description and specifications for a reason maybe try reading those before you buy it. Anyways, The headset itself is absolutely astonishing for a budget. The only thing that bothers me is how uncomfortable to face padding will get. And also when I first got it I've noticed that the front headset slider tends to pop itself out of place and extend out during my gameplay.

It is published that the Rift S only supports a Display Port, but I thought I would be able to get an HDMI to Display Port adapter. As of 5/24/2019, no HDMI to Display Port adapter is fast enough to support the Rift S. If you have a USB C port even with Thunderbolt 3 support, there is not a very good chance that your graphics cards is connected to this port. If you open your graphics card control panel and check the configuration you can find out. You will not be able to use the Rift S if your graphics card does not already have a Display Port.

Bought this as my first VR headset, was a little annoyed to find that it required win. 10, as I was running 7 at the time.  Mainly bought it to play Elite: Dangerous, and it performs spectacularly in game.No hassle with base stations, good picture quality, good motion tracking.  The controllers are light and easy to get used to, and i found myself buying VR titles left and right shortly after getting it up and running.  Most complaints I've seen revolve around the inside-out tracking method, but it does a superb job as long as the controllers are visible to the cameras, and does pretty well with them behind the back using their built in sensors.I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a cheaper alternative to other headsets, or an introductory setup to test the waters.

I have owned or still own a decent amount of VR systems. Quest, Go, original Rift, Rift S, PS VR, and original HTC Vive. The new Rift S is hands down my favorite for VR tethered to a PC. Setup was seamless and the inside out tracking is great. Getting rid of the external sensors was a God Send and the new panels are much clearer and crisp then the original. Yes Oled had slightly deeper blacks but the crisper resolution, reduced god light effect, and reduced screen door effect is worth the loss of oled. Vive cant seem to make up its mind on a platform, steam is clunky, no good exclusives, and outrageous price in my opinion make Oculus Rift S the clear winner until they officially release their new model in a few years. Its also smart business with what they did. Release an affordable and easy to setup device to reach more consumers which will hopefully entice big developers to get onboard to make some killer triple A titles. Of course this is just my opinion.

Everything seems to be working except that when placed on our MSI gaming laptop the minidisplay port works for 15 seconds on latest nvidia drivers then goes black. Tried all the suggested walkthroughs for laptops (removing energy savings settings, resettings wired connections on device and laptop, rebooting, etc. Nothing worked until I installed nidia driver 417.71. I was about to send it back as a defect too but now I'm just hoping oculus/nvidia/windows fixes display port errors and lets me know its safe to update.Laptop with problem (most MSI laptops from what I hear): GS65 Stealth THIN-051-1/2 star for driver issues-1/2 star for tracking being almost as bad as the playstation VR

Completely awful system. This is the last Oculus product I will ever buy. Hard to believe that their first Oculus was better than this one. Normally you get better with each generation but not Oculus. It will not start up over half the time with dots blinking at me and the audio is horrendous. I can hear a thing.... I recommend going in another direction for VR.

Does not work on laptops. Have to have a display port and when used the adapter that comes with it it only worked for a week and when reached out to oculus about it they did not help. Was told not to use adapter with it. It was their adapter that came with the system forth purpose of using it with a laptop that only has a mini display port. Tried for weeks and they never gave any creditable  help in getting it fixed.

Geez, what don’t I like about this headset? It’s very affordable compared to the others but has amazing quality and so many great exclusives. The buttons and headset is very high quality for only $400.I love it so much and would not turn back from it!It’s very comfortable and does not overheat from intense gaming sessions. I bought some prescription lenses to go in the headset. I where glasses and don’t want to scratch the lenses. This makes it very enjoyable and doesn’t hurt your face or headset. I highly suggest getting a pair from VR Optician if you wear glasses and decide on getting a VR headset.

This was probably the worst VR headset I have ever  bought, I had a CV1 before this, never had any issues at all with that, I bought this because it was supposed to be a refresh to the CV1, it came in the mail and worked for the first day, near the end of the day the pass through mode completely broke and made me sick if I left the boundary, I played Boneworks for hours before and had my VR legs, but it showed a still image from hours before when it entered pass through and didn't change when I looked, I tried everything on the internet to get it working. Never did, I sent it back and swapped it for the Quest 2.

I received the headset a little while ago, and it worked wonderfully for a few weeks and then it became unresponsive, perpetually stuck in a loading screen.  After a week and a half of troubleshooting and correspondence with (not very helpful) Oculus support, I was to send them my headset for a replacement.  Upon receiving the new headset, I discovered immediately that this one is nonfunctional in a different way, the tracking sensors are not working.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! BUY VIVE OR INDEX!

It’s fine I feel like the resolution isn’t as big as the original oculus but I guess it is.  Since I wear glasses when I put on the headset I can’t see as much since I have to push the display farther away and today I ended up scratching the lens a bit because it rubbed against my glasses during a game session even when it was pushed away.  For people with glasses it’s comfortable but if there not just right they will scratch the oculus lenses.  Also the ipd adjustments are horrible they literally do nothing since they are now software and not hardware so it’s always a little blurry even with my glasses on.

Upgraded from the CV1, and was a little apprehensive at first as I wasn't sure if the S would be enough of a step up from the original. Glad to report that it is without a doubt, and I would recommend this to any CV1 owner on the fence. The world really is much clearer in the S, comparable to going from 800x600 to Full-HD. Colors are brighter and pop more in comparison.Also found the new halo style head band to be more comfortable than the original. Head tracking may not be as smooth as the CV1 with light houses, but at the same time it works well and is only noticeable when switching back to the CV1. Audio is not nearly as bad as some make out to be.Really glad I made the jump to the S, as I cannot go back to the blurry world of the CV1 again.

I bought this about a week after launch, and I feel that while they could've had a better product at launch, the time they took to fix bugs and major problems that made the Rift S unplayable was pretty good.  I had a problem where the app said the rift s needed an update, but it wouldn't give me the option to install that update, but after about a week, they fixed it.Apart from the bugs, the adjustments for the headset are very good.  While you can wear glasses with the headset, it is uncomfortable.  Otherwise, everything else about the adjustments is fine.  The alignment for the screen is difficult to get so it isn't blurry but most of the time it's fine.  Sensors are great and it's all great.

Awesome when it works. The games are fun and we've come a long way in terms of virtual reality.However. The device only works about 50% of the time. I've probably spent more time troubleshooting it than playing it.I had to get a replacement because my first was DOA. I had to get a separate USB card so it would get enough power. The number of times I've had to unplug it and plug it back in is countless as well as the number of times I've had to do a complete uninstall.Honestly if the games weren't so good I would return it.

Do not blame oculus for DisplayPort when it litterly says video output is a display port... And yes the headset is good I have a quest 2 and I kind of wanted to make an oculus collection but the reason I’m giving this product a 4 star is because of the IPD which really kind of made me mad because the original rift had a manual IPD thing and the rift s does not have one.

It's a very simple setup, which is excellent. You just need a USB 3.0 port and a Displayport port. No need to external sensors. It can play pretty much any VR game as well! It's also comfortable, and not heavy at all. The display is also nice as well.Unfortunately, the firmware is horrendous. It crashes a lot, so a good chunk of your time will be spent fiddling with the cables and rebooting, trying to get it to work. It seems Oculus prefers to spend their time updating the Quest, so if you want to get into VR, it's best to go with that.

VR with the Oculus Rift S is not a gimmick. It's  an awesome experience unlike any other. The only issue I've had is with motion sickness in some games.

The product has very good and easy installation of software. And for all for all of the tracking being on the headset i was very surprised how little issues i ran into. Only after holding my arm behind my head for 2 to 3 seconds would it disconnect from the headset. This also had to be center of back. Only issues id give this headset is that every now and then it will simply not show anything through the headset. Ill still hear the audio of the hud place as well as interact with it but i wont be able to see anything. This issue is the only one ive found and it has a simple solution of just 1. unplugging and plugging back in the headset or 2. restart your pc. The time after your unplug and plug it back into your display port it works again after about 2 seconds no re-verifying the headset on your pc or anything like that.

It works well with your PC if it is powerful enough. I would not suggest this for any beginners to the field of gaming on PC. If you would like the same experience and you are new to VR and/or gaming I would rather suggest the Oculus Quest, that being the portable all-in-one system.

The Oculus Rift S has way too many bugs. I couldn't even get it started because of the app's infinite loop of ""requires restart"". Reading online, the issues I encountered are VERY common and, based off of the reviews and posts, there will be reoccurring issues.

My first Rift S I received actually had a faulty controller that wouldn't consistently track in certain situations.  Amazon promptly sent another and after testing, it works perfectly.  I came from a Lenovo Explorer and while it was a pretty decent headset, the Rift is better in every way so far.  The headset itself is comfortable even for longer sessions though it can get a bit warm.  I opted for the Rift S over the Quest since I only intend to use it with my gaming PC and it is definitely the better option for PCVR due to the higher clarity/comfort/etc.

Some stuff looks ""blurry"" but it doesn't feel like it is bad, only causes some eye fatigue.Biggest issue with my Rift S was during the setup. When I was instructed to set up Guardian, my VR had no image whatsoever. All troubleshooting threads online were no use. As an AMD RX590 user, the solution was to update the GPU drivers, as opposed to Nvidia which required a downgrade.I'm very glad that I'm starting VR with this exceptional product.

I went the route of 3D printing the mounting brackets for the Koss Porta Pro's, and then this headset was satisfactory. The built in audio just wrecks the whole thing for me. Gave it 4 stars for the quality of the visuals, and I really am enjoying the headset, but I shouldn't have had to modify it.

This thing is comfortable, the controllers are great, the screen is good, the software is good and easy to use, it ran and looked well, except for one really really important thing, It has a fixed lense which I believe is 64.5 ipd and if you are not between 60 and 68 ipd you will probably have a blurry, nausea inducing, eyewatering time (I am a 58 ipd). If you think ok I will just get the quest like I did, that was a terrible mistake. It is the opposite of this, hot, uncomfortable, really front heavy, terrible battery life, low-res graphics. (Hey it's portable yay /s) I figured out all this on the quest in 30 minutes (tried it a little bit longer) went back immediately after.

I can only say one thing that I liked about it and that is the way it looked. I find it very frustrating that they don’t support 3rd party adapters. I have a gaming laptop that is said to be VRready but yet it won’t work with it because it doesn’t support adapters for a DisplayPort to HTMI. For me this produce was unusable and they could be getting a lot more money out of people with laptops if they supported adapters.

It’s soooo painful! I’m just the average consumer and bought this to have fun after extensive research. The overall experience is great and the headband has good weight distribution but the in less than 30 minutes of wearing it the pad puts the worst pressure ever. The feeling is like if you were wearing headphones and the band is wearing on the crown of your head it’s so painful. Saying this there is a fix you can buy the deluxe audio strap for the htc vive and use it for this. By doing that it is the perfect vr headset for the price. There is an issue of the tracking but it’s barely noticeable.

Pros the resolution bump is very noticeable it's almost like a layer of vaseline being removed versus the rift v1 extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time.Cons : Tracking is hit or miss just mediocre but over time I feel oculus will optimize this issue. The refresh rate is a slightly noticeable drop from 90 to 80hz. Sometimes when you step outside the barrier you drew for your play area the game your playing will crash. My biggest problem with the headset is how much it costs  440 with tax i would wait until a sell if you were goning to pick this up.

Great VR experience for the entry level. Runs smoothly with my 8700k and RTX 2070 build. So far having a blast playing various VR titles, though I do only have two (minor) complaints so far. Every time that I want to boot my Oculus rift s up, I do have to unplug and replug it back it onto my pc with the oculus software up and running. Second issue is that I did wish the original cable to be a little lengthier. For the most part, the length of the cable works in my room, but it probably won't be long enough if you got a fairly large play area (mine is relatively small)

Initially there was a problem with black screen related to the Display port but that has been corrected.  Far better resolution than original Rift and more comfortable with Halo design in my opinion.  Inside out tracking works beautifully for my needs.  I was disappointed with the audio due to lack of integrated headphones but I now use my own pair and the audio is impeccable and I have to say I actually prefer the new headphone-less design as I now only use the headphones for games/experiences that I want it for (Drop Dead, Roller Coasters, etc.) and can use the integrated audio for more casual experience.

I was kind of skeptical of getting it since most people said they got it and it didn’t work, but I had to take the risk. I have an ASUS ROG STRIX laptop that is compatible enough to run VR. I hooked in the headset and calibrated everything in a really short time which was great. However, sometimes the oculus software will act all shitty as in telling you to keep recallibrating everytime, the best way to fix that is to ignore it. Oculus are updating firmwares every couple of weeks so the headset is improving. If you want to buy this headset, get it, you won’t lose anything.

The headset is great. It can track the controllers really well without using external sensors. The screendoor effect is hard to notice and the graphic is decent for its price. But, it also scratches my $300 glasses. My glasses fit the dimension that the official docs claims it supports.

It's okay for the price compared to other VR headsets.  The inside out tracking is hit or miss.  In most games the headset has tracking issues.  So in games like Beatsaber you miss hitting objects due to the bad controller tracking.  I still feel like a headsets like the Valve Index and HTC Vive that have Lighthouses offer better controller tracking.If you want something cheap that is plug and play and don't care about the controllers not tracking with 100% accuracy then this headset is probably okay for you.

Otherwise, it will never work on your computer.When I purchase this item on Thanksgiving Sale, I just paid, and assumed that I will be ready to jump into the world of VR once it is arrived.

Device broke within 3 months after spotty performance throughout, consistent with many of these reviews.  Oculus support is absolutely useless - they will do everything possible to get you to waste your time sending them logs and then claim that your device is a ""special case"" because you bought it through Amazon.  After 2 weeks of back and forth, I returned the device as defective - what a disappointment!

Occculus rift s was purchased for my son- we did research prior to ordering. even ran their compatability check against his lenovo laptop and everything cleared. since we received it it has not been able to connect to the laptop. occulus support is horrible- no phone# only available thru emails. in the end after weeks of going back and forth their response was upgrade to an ""occulus"" supported laptop. where even their own site confirms his current laptop is compatible.

This was to be an upgrade from the Rift. Well, as many noted, they decided to switch from HDMI to DP. I have a state of the art gaming laptop, bought within the last month, but it doesn’t have a DP, in fact, if you look at the Oculus site they only list 4 laptops with DP. So my VR ready laptop is not compatible. This is one Oculus customer they have lost. I read that somewhere near 90% of laptop do not have a DP and if they do, they are on the real high end. What is FB thinking? Do not buy.

The Occulus Rift S was an amazing VR experience for about 1 week.  Bought it for a Christmas gift and my son and our family played with it for a week and then the VR headset would no longer display games.  Online searching indicated the problem could be fixed with changing video display port cable as Occulus Rift S was known to malfunction and no longer display video on headset.  Blogs also suggested using HDMI cable for monitor but neither strategy did not fix VR headset malfunction.

El movimiento tanto de la cabeza como de las manos se registra de manera excelente. Coincido con lo que dicen las críticas en que el sonido que trae integrado no es de lo mejor, fue pensado para usarse con auriculares seguramente. También da calor tenerlo puesto durante un tiempo.

(It takes a shorter time to set it up, but I was inexperienced so it took me a bit of time to figure out with a youtube guide.)The headset feels comfortable to wear for LONG periods of time, doesn't feel cramped or anything like that.

So this would be my first Virtual Reality headset and I was hoping to make many memories having fun using this but my wish had only lasted a month. After one month of use, the headset had become unusable. All the sensors on the headset would stop responding. The Gyroscope Sensors for orientation, the accelerometer sensors would stop working and the actual tracking of the controllers would stop working. The only thing that did work we the controllers and that's about it. If you plan to buy a VR headset, save up for something that would last longer like the Vive.

The headset is amazing, having tested previously PSVR and Rift CV1, it is indeed an upgrade. Audio ports provide basic function, good enough for party VR games (same room)  but not enough for immersive simulation games I recommend connecting an in-ear headset to the VR jack or the PS Gold headphones if you're more of an over the ear guy, since these were made to clear the PSVR setup which is pretty similar. All in all good entry VR, amazing library and simplicity of setup. Just remember your graphics card need a free Display Port and if you're a laptop user, it needs to have mini DP for it to be usable (DP to mini DP adapter is included)

After receiving this HMD I spent many hours trying to set it up with my newly build pc. It was entirely unable to set up. I looked all over the internet and couldn't get anything to fix it. I contacted Oculus and they couldn't help me. I even bought a usb 3.0 pcie expansion card, and that did nothing. Needless to say I'm gonna buy from a different brand in the future. Be weary.

I suppose it does ok for running on 2 year old mobile phone technology. And I am used to the Rift, so it's a step down.  That being said, it's the best portable VR headset out there. I have enjoyed the heck out of it. It will be better once more games are out for it.

I love this headset. There are so many games and apps to choose for. Fantastic for media and about the best you can get for games. Issues like the Oculus not tracking the touch controllers correctly have largely been addressed with a recent update. I've have the Oculus Go and Google Daydream and both have nothing on this set in terms of entertainment and resolution quality. The only draw back is I am confined to my room which I choose to be anyhow, and the cord is annoying at times. I certainly have had a blast, and I'm looking forward to the improvements I will enjoy with it over time.

I got to be real and say this was a super fun vr and i enjoyed using it however when u get it let me tell u guys something. Do not bend the wire , dont step on it when its plugged in and make sure your wire is protected. When your wire gets bad it will take forever to connect and it will start auto logging out when you leave it for a second

This is my first review ever and I'm hands down beyond satisfied. Their service blew my mind so much, I received my first Oculus Rift S VR set earlier than my delivery time frame was set for. I'm so impressed I ordered a second Oculus Rift S VR set today the same day I received my first order.  Both times I paid the extra $$$ for an expedited delivery and with my first experience I have to say it is so worth it. This vendor is awesome, I'm very pleased with their service especially for a product like this. I will update this post when my second order arrives!

The day my Rift s came in I was so excited to test it out.  I plugged everything up and ran into sensoring issues, fixed those, and then the final blow was the displayport issues, the display port they supply didn't even work, the most I worked was it going off and on, when it did stop turning off and on for a bit I went into a game and my controllers wouldn't even work(yes they were paired) and I had a black screen.  I can see why this thing is getting discontinued.

This is my fourth PC VR HMD and I was a bit worried about going from an Odyssey+ back to LCD but after using the device for the first time, I am really impressed with it. Very clear display and once you're immersed in an environment, the screen door effect is barely noticeable. The lower refresh rate is really not an issue and the tracking is very smooth and constant unlike the WMR headsets I had.  All-in-all a good buy and a must have for any person wanting to get into VR  for the first time.

The first time I used be, it blew my mind. This technology is game changing but still has a long way to go. The headset has annoying wires that get in the way, it overheats in long sessions, and it made me motion sick. I would say there’s still more kinks to be worked out, I would wait till improvements are made before purchasing again. I had to return this due to the motion sickness.

Amazing! Completely filled my expectations. I highly recommend the Rift S. I had zero issues setting up and running the headset. The screen plus optics gives a much clearer image than rift and vive. The built in audio is adequate for what it is. You can always use your own headphones for better sound immersion. The controller tracking so far is flawless for the situations I used it in. I think in most situations you will be very pleased with the tracking.

Oculus worked great for about 5 days, and then  the sensors stopped working. I wanted to work with Oculus, but they have no contact number. You have to submit a repair ticket, and it took 5 days just to get an email back. Still no live help, even via chat. I returned it through Amazon and got another one. Within 5 days, the video cable on that one stopped working. I've decided to try PS4 VR instead.

It’s nice for little things or getting into VR but any fast pace games the tracking will not keep up, you will miss hits in beat saber, and sometimes the tracking will just not work at all and you have to restart oculus. The controllers are super uncomfortable compared to the first version. They feel top heavy and awkward to hold. I returned mine and got the valve index and the premium price was absolutely worth it. Will probably never go Oculus again

If you have a VR capable PC definitely consider this. VR is a lot of fun to play yourself, and to share with friends and family who haven't played it before either.

I really liked the customization options for the rift s and the experience is awaome. The only problem is that the face mask for the headset can start to hurt after long sessions. (Usually when sweating)  It does kind of feel like needles in your face but after a quick wipe down and freshen up, it will feel better after that. Otherwise, the headset is really awesome and is so awesome just to setup in like 5mins and not have to pair to much to the headset. I would recommend this to someone if they had a good PC and want a budget effective headset

Overall an OK VR Experience, could have been better if there was Physical IPD adjustment. If you do not have the correct IPD for this headset, you WILL NOT be able to use this product. Just have it be a blurry mess. Software IPD is a poor substitute. But if you do meet the requirements, you will have an absolute blast after your body gets used to VR Motion.

IPD 70.5mm is here, and it's more than playable for me!When I ordered the headset, I haven't done my IPD measurement yet at that moment. Yeah, and it was already late to cancel the order after I measured my IPD, it was surprisingly high -- 70.5mm and the requirements for the headset were a much lower around -- 64mm. Hopefully, there is a software adjustment from 58mm up to 72mm, and it works well!

Worth the upgrade from Rift. I am not sure why some people are saying it is not worth it. The image is so much better. It's just clear and it doesnt feel like looking through binoculars. I think the issue is that some of the games are not setting the resolution properly and I think it's because they want to make the Oculus Link comparable. Robo Recall sets the correct resolution and it's almost night and day.

The CV1 was the pinnacle of occulus VR. This is pretty terrible for the users that are into VR already. The hand tracking is terrible, when they Implimented inside out tracking it was a big mistake..Looking at you any shooter games or beat saber....hands are constantly losing tracking. They need to add support for external sensors, that would resolve these issues.

VR has been great for the last several years but it has been an investment in setup, space and time.  The Rift S seems to have solved these by almost completely auto-magically setting up the space for you.  Plug it in, turn it on, put it on and it asks if things look right, (yes/no) then outline the playspace with a laser pointer like interface.  Jump into games and experinces.  That's pretty much it.

So far so good. It's really fun and met my expectations. The resolution is fantastic and it's really light on the head.

While it has decent graphics. The tracking on the remotes and on yourself (since it is built in camera tracking) is very bad...

Game options through steam and oculus app are great.Not having to set up space scanners are great. The head set does the scanning of area on it's own. The audio in the headset was an actual surprise how good it sounds. You can hook up your own head phones but I dont think its needed.

To be honest, I wasn't able to use this because I assumed it would have an hdmi plugin instead of the displayport plugin, as I did not even know that existed until I purchased this. Tried several methods to make it work for me on my laptop, but unfortunately, nothing worked. Leaving a 4-star review due to the fact that the problem would have been solved by more careful research, but also taking into account that most products use hdmi, making the assumption that this does as well a reasonable assumption to make.

My only beef with this order was not the product itself, but the delivery. When this order was dropped off on my solid cement porch, the driver dropped it a good 6 inches onto the porch upside down. Luckily nothing was broken and it all still worked perfectly. Definitely make sure to have at least a 3-6ft area to play.

The device worked ok for a few months but now has had a sensor tracking issue for over a month now. Oculus customer service communicates through email only and I have gone back and forth with them at least 5 times trying to find a fix. It is basically a paperweight at this point.

Straight out of the box, from day 1, the left controller doesn't work. Went through all the support FAQs, spent a few hours digging through oculus support forum, reddit, etc., no solution so far. Customer Support dragged me through a few standard questions (in part ignoring my description of the problem), asked for some unrelated details, gave me some unrelated advice and went quiet. Considering returning the item.

I think you will need to limit the amount of fun you can have with this device. Not suitable for a small room, need space to maximize fun. The games will make you sweat and the headset will soak it up so passing it around might be a little gross. Buy the overpriced protective pads would be my advise. If you have motion sickness or get light headed then this might not be for you.

Tracking is fairly accurate for the most part but having no sensors is a huge convenience upgrade.Perfect for newbies looking to get into vr or a worthwhile upgrade for existing rift 1 owners.  Sound is definitely a downgrade and a weak point of the headset.8 out of 10!

Works great once you figure out how to have it properly plunged in.1). make sure on PC boot up that it is NOT plugged in,2). after pc boot up start the oculus app,3.) plug 3.0 usb in first, then plug in the display port (its picky and you will have to find the correct one it wants).If oculus app needs to constantly reset refer to step 3.

It's super light and therefore pretty comfy, and has little to no light bleed.However it was pretty blurry and I can't wear it for more than half an hour at a time because I have 59mm IPD and it's stuck at 64mm IPD.  The software IPD adjuster did not fix the problem for me at all.

This Headset works great. The only potential down side is dependent on if your USB 3.0 Ports will be compatible or not. My experience with the the 3.0 ports I had on my motherboard forced me to purchase a USB PCI 3.1 port Card.After, the USB issue was resolved I had no problems with the Rift S.

It doesn't require controller-tracking cameras (because it has several cameras on the headset itself), Oculus software is very friendly, displays in model Rift S have very nice DPI, the single cable is 5 meters long, awesome! I've got Rift S for myself and recommended it my friends.

USB 3 is not at a point where it is a good option for all information transfer that needs to take place.

Device software is completedly broken, it does not connect to pc and is a known issue by the Oculus developers. It connects whenever it wants and that is not most of the time. It completedly brokes the use and makes you not want to use it at all.

Maybe this is on me for not properly researching but it was an Xmas gift my daughter requested.  Turns out we don’t have a PC or laptop powerful enough to support this Oculus so I had to return it.

Setup was a piece of cake, and the visuals and tracking were way above anything I could have expected.

For certain motherboard configurations, this helm will need an external powered USB hub to prevent tracking errors from time to time. There are workarounds by re-installing it, but if you leave the headset idle for any length of time and then try to pick it back up, you should really get a powered USB 3.0 hub for it.

It’s a really good headset. Good visual quality, no need for base stations. Audio sounds fine and my mic sounds good.Now you might wonder why I gave it 3/5 stars? Oculus software. Oculus’s software is awful.

It works, but not if you have a laptop. For those who decide to get it know that you need a display port or a micro displayport on the computer to avoid running around for days and finding expensive adapters

Works well. Good comfort, good resolution. The only thing is that the batteries for controllers use up pretty quickly if you let the cable connects to PC all the time. Because the controllers remain on standby whenever the PC is on. There is an app called “oculus tray tool” that can help with that.

There is risk of getting unit with hardware problems. Not such a big deal for american buyers, because they can get support from Oculus. I got lucky, my unit is mostly fine. Just hope Oculus will be able to fix random one frame in 20 minutes screen static with software updates.

I was fortunate to be an early reviewer for the Rift S. I was able to use this VR headset for about nine weeks before it was released. I also own the original Rift, the HTC Vive Pro, the Pimax 5K and the Samsung Odyssey Plus.  I mainly use my VR headsets with DCS World and IL2 Battle of Stalingrad flight sims but I also enjoy Skyrim VR, Beat Saber, The Climb and theBLU (ocean VR). In the VR world, you can play Beat It Saber or grow a pair and fly against a real F-18 Hornet pilot online with DCS World in VR. Flight sims are far more demanding on PC systems than many of the current VR titles like Robo Recall, Beat Saber, SuperHot VR and The Climb. Flight sims require fast processors, fairly up to date graphics cards (think GTX 1070 or higher) and 32 GB of RAM (if you want decent realism). Because of the precision needed for formation flight and online dogfighting, I can think of no other area for the general consumer/gaming crowd that taxes the graphics card to VR pipeline more. (obviously not counting specialized scientific and mathematical applications)  I will first compare the Rift S with the original Rift and then with the other headsets I own.The Positives:  I disliked the original Rift because I use a 2080 Ti graphics card that has only one HDMI port which powers the 65 inch Samsung TV I use as my main monitor. This means with the original Rift, I had to fool with locating a DisplayPort to HDMI connector that actually worked (and several did not). The Rift S uses a DisplayPort connector (and has a mini-DisplayPort connector in the box). Obviously, I can now have my VR headset and my monitor plugged into my graphics card without the need for wonky Chinese adapters. Win-win.  Secondly, the original Rift and its two needed sensors required three USB 3.0 ports and they got mouthy if they were plugged into a powered USB hub. The new Rift S has five onboard cameras in the headset that do the tracking for you without the need for additional on the desktop sensors and require only one USB 3.0 plug. That is a win for my motherboard that has only seven USB 3.0 connections that are slaved to numerous flight sim sticks, throttles and pedals. The tracking on the Rift S is not as good as the original Rift, but it is 98% as good. More than enough for spotting a Su-27 moving at 600 knots in a tight online dogfight. More than enough to continue shaking yourself to death with Beat Saber on the most difficult levels. If you move one of your hand controllers behind your head (where the built in cameras cannot see it), you will momentarily lose tracking but it is hardly worth mentioning.  Third, the Rift S still allows light to come through at the nose. For flight simmers like myself that need to look down at our keyboards frequently, that is a needed touch. For most of you, it will be slight negative, but nothing you can’t fix by adding in your own MacGyver foam mod for less than $3. The amount of light let in is still very minimal and slightly less than the original Rift.  Fourth, the Rift S has slightly increased resolution at 1280 x 1440 per eye compared to the original Rift at 1080 x 1200 per eye. It is nothing that will get your girlfriend to remove her clothes for in your mother’s basement but it is noticeable. If the game or sim you are using does not brush up against the total pixel pushing power of your graphics card, then you will see a modest upgrade.  Fifth and far more important, the Rift S does provide a noticeable decrease in screen door effect (SDE). More important than resolution for me with VR is how seamless the environment is recreated. Normally, I chalk most manufacturers anti-SDE talk to marketing BS, but the Rift S really does make a small but noticeable difference in better recreation compared to the original Rift.  Sixth, the hand controller battery covers are less prone to sliding off than with the original Rift system. They track just as well as the original and are slightly smaller and weigh a little bit less.  Seventh, Facebook and Oculus decided not to screw us too badly by setting the price at $399, which compared to the competition is reasonable. More on this in a bit.Neutral -  I like the headbands on the original Rift and Rift S equally. I have not weighed both headsets but I suspect the Rift S weighs slightly more (I think it is 510 grams). The Rift S headband is almost identical to the one on the Samsung Odyssey Plus, which is comfortable for three or four hours of use at a time. If you need it to be comfortable for more than that, consider getting out and meeting a quality partner and enjoying real sunshine until Singularity arrives. The Rift S headband is slightly faster and easier to set than the original Rift. After, say, two hours of use, the original Rift will leave imprint marks around your eye sockets, where as the Rift S will leave a slight imprint mark in the center of your forehead.  The Rift S uses an LCD instead of OLED like the original Rift. This means better fill factor and sharpness but blacks are slightly more washed out. After flying against other top level pilots online, I found I prefer the Rift S but your mileage may vary. The decreased screen door effect was more than enough to offset the very slightly reduced colors of the LCD. The maximum refresh rate on the Rift S is now 80 Hz (Hertz – cycles per second) compared to 90 Hz on the original Rift. I was never able to notice this in use though.  The hand controllers now vibrate from the top instead of throughout the body like the original Rift system. No biggie for me but some sensitive folks may notice it.  Setup for me took about five minutes but I will say that the Rift S is very picky about what DisplayPort and what USB 3.0 slot you plug it into. My 2080 Ti graphics card has 4 DisplayPort jacks and the Rift S did not like the first two I tried. It also did not like it when I plugged its USB cable into a powered USB 3.0 hub rather than into the back of my motherboard.Negatives -  The built in speakers are not as nice as the over-the-ear headphones on the original Rift. Sound for me is not that big a deal and I was fine with them. However, if your shaft only grows hard when you are wearing $1000 Sennheiser over the ear phones, then prepare to stay soft. You can however, if you are an audiophile, plug your own earbuds into this headset (3.5 mm jack).  Second, the Interpupillary Distance (IPD) is software set with the Oculus dashboard for the Rift S compared to the manual adjustment on the headset for the original Rift. My noggin is standard deviation material on the Gaussian yolk size scale, as is my IPD. I set IPD to 63 millimeters and had no problems whatsoever. Plenty of people are complaining about the software calibration of the IPD but I found it to be just as effective as the manual switch on the original Rift. If you are Gregor Clegane however, you might be so pi##ed that you have to implode a few Oculus skulls before your rage abates. I suspect only whiners who have their poodles custom groomed and cannot eat food unless it is gluten free will be affected but I could be wrong.  For me, I am happy that the Rift S has a DisplayPort connection but it really should have come with a 3 prong, one for DisplayPort, one for HDMI and one for the USB. That would stop some of the whining you see in the reviews here at Amazon for the Rift S.Overall –  Despite the slight reduction in sound quality, I much prefer the Rift S because of the built in tracking, slight increase in resolution and much reduced screen door effect. It beats the original Rift hands down.In Comparison to the Competition –  This is a more complex question, because no graphics card out currently can push VR headsets to 90 Hz (or 80 Hz with the Rift S) with max settings. Oculus, HTC, Samsung and Pimax also have not enabled their headsets to work with multiple graphics cards (a’la Nvidia SLI). This means the limiting power right now is how many pixels a single RTX 2080 Ti can push (or a Titan if you are filthy rich). The Pimax 5k, Odyssey Plus and Vive Pro all have higher resolutions than the Rift S but in order to turn the resolution up in a flight sim, you have to turn other settings down (like shadows, building detail, etc ...). I can run the Rift S at higher settings in DCS World at 30 fps or I can run the higher resolution Vive Pro for example at the same settings with 22 FPS. Since there is no graphics card more powerful than the Titan or 2080 Ti, it is currently not possible to run DCS World at say, the Vive Pro resolution with all settings on high and stay above 30 FPS. For pure resolution, the Pimax is the best, but their software is not fully baked yet and the sweet spot is small. A 1080 Ti or 2080 Ti card cannot push even close to max resolution at high settings. After playing with all the headsets quite a bit, the Rift S comes in second right behind the Odyssey Plus when playing DCS World with a pixel density set at 2.0 on a RTX 2080 Ti graphics card.  The Odyssey Plus has the higher resolution and the over the ear headphones and is about equal concerning the screen door effect. The Odyssey Plus decreases frames per second more than the Rift S for the same settings (as it should), but even with the hit, it is just that tiny bit better than the Rift S. (and the sound is better)(both have about the same sweet spot) The Odyssey also includes built in tracking but uses the less elegant Windows Mixed Reality platform. The HTC Vive Pro is just a small margin behind the Rift S. The resolution is better but the screen door effect is more noticeable as well. They were very close but I preferred the Rift S. (the Vive Pro can be adapted to be fully wireless for an extra $300 but it requires three USB hogging sensors like the original Rift) The Pimax 5K has the greatest potential and when Nvidia finally releases the RTX 9080 Ti in 2029, it will no doubt blow the Rift S and others out of the water, but right now due to the sweet spot and software issues, it is only slightly better than the original Rift. All of my subjective rankings would immediately change if we could tie three or four RTX 2080 Ti cards together in three or four way SLI. If that were possible, I have a feeling I would easily say the Pimax 5K is the best.  When you consider that the Samsung Odyssey Plus is currently priced at $299 (with the hand controllers), the Rift S is set at $399, the Vive Pro is $799, and the Pimax 5K is $699 (at their website), you can see that the Rift S falls into a tight but still secondary position to the Odyssey Plus. However, we have not mentioned software and applications. This is purely pulled from my buttocks, but I prefer the Oculus software and their library to that of HTC or Windows Mixed Reality. The Rift and Rift S just flat out work with the largest library of VR games and sims because Facebook has the market muscle. You do not have to fart around with Windows Mixed Reality or Steam VR settings when using the Rift S, .... it just flat out is recognized and works.  If you just use VR for one or two games and they are compatible with the Odyssey Plus, then by all means, consider it. For me, with only DCS World, it comes in first place. But when I consider other apps, then the Rift S starts to displace it. Valve’s Steam is working to port many different games to Windows Mixed Reality but it is not as smooth as the Oculus dashboard experience.  So, yes, … the Rift S beats the original Rift for me. For my favorite sim, DCS World, the Samsung Odyssey slightly beats it out in resolution and especially in audio. In most other VR environments, I would probably go with the Rift S. … My two cents.

Go search for yourself, you don't have to take my word for it.I've had my Rift S for a year. They released an mandatory firmware update that breaks the device, you'll spend more time plugging and unplugging it from your PC than you will playing.Customer support is absolutely useless. This has been a problem for over six months and Oculus hasn't fixed it.Please trust me, go do some searches on Rift S display port not detected errors, thousands of people suddenly have a really expensive paperweight. Save your money, VR is amazing, the Rift S is NOT.

I supported Occulus development through Kickstarter and adopted early versions of this hardware because I believe it's truly a game changer for how we interact with data, entertainment, and ultimately each other. Not in a ""Ready Player One"" dystopian sense - but as a facilitator of authentic human interaction where it just would not be possible. I was saddened when the purveyor of fundamentally inauthentic human interactions purchased the company but the relationship wasn't a necessary one - until now.If you buy this device, Facebook will demand you not only jack in to their platform but also insist that you get the kids their own accounts for them to harvest if you want to use more than one headset at a time.While the Rift S does have problems and was released in order to meet marketing timelines rather than achieve a solid user experience, it remains a compelling experience and an excellent buy on its own. Which is a shame because there's no way I would ever expose my family to the data analytics of Facebook just to play a virtual game. This rating is due to what you have to give up if you buy the product and really is not about what you get. Which is appropriate because the deal Facebook has always made with users is this:Use our commodity, become our commodity.Not something I can recommend.

My favorite 3 games are wonderful, and on good days I love playing them. I really wanted to love this thing! The basic VR code and hardware are quite good; those original volunteers did a magnificent job. But then Facebook bought it, and now the bugs, issues, and problems are too severe to ignore. In particular the support that Facebook provides during the summer of 2020 is the worst I've ever seen! And that's saying a lot, considering the many contenders for this dubious honor through the years!  Many of the games that are offered at quite high prices simply don't work at all. The good reviews for them are fake. And you're supposed to be able to get your money back if you can't play them, but that doesn't usually work in reality. You're just screwed, and tech support will never even consider helping you . The Oculus platform is loaded with bugs and problems, and of the 31 times I've asked tech support for help, they have never once been helpful. They're polite and they speak English well. But their answers range from useless to downright dangerous and stupid. I fear that they get paid by the email, rather than being incentivized to solve problems. Even for well-known and documented problems, they waste your time and give you long lists of directions for completely removing and reinstalling your Oculus Rift and software. But that never helps at all. At least make sure that if you buy this thing, you get it from a reputable seller like Amazon, so that if you have serious problems, you will at least be able to return it for a refund.A well known issue with these units is that the USB power input is greedy for power. If your USB ports on your PC are to spec and provide 5 volts, the Oculus will give you a DisplayPort error! And if you ask their support about this issue, you will receive some hilarious responses. No correct ones though! The solution for most people is to buy a ""hot"" USB port card for your PC, something like the Inateck Superspeed 7 Ports PCI-E to USB 3.0 Expansion Card. This card provides about 5.2 Volts at the USB 3 and the Oculus's DisplayPort will work. But you'll never hear about that from Oculus support.Another common issue is that the Oculus's compatibility detection is hopelessly broken. No matter if your PC is ancient or brand new, you will receive errors saying that it is too old and slow to work with Oculus. Large banner errors, that block your access to the software and intrude in menus. There are some fixes you can google online, but none of the things Oculus support will tell you is ever more than just a waste of your time. It is painfully irritating and should have been removed from the software long ago if they can't be bothered to keep it up to date and working.But as bugs and problems go, this is just the tip of the iceberg. That's not even surprising for such a capable and cutting edge device; of course we're going to be basically beta-testers. But Oculus's tech support is supposed to help us with this sort of thing. It is frustrating that Facebook's support of the Oculus is so useless considering how much money they've spent on all this. you have to wonder what they're doing over there.Rumor is that they will start requiring a Facebook login to use Oculus, even if you are able to use it at all. That can't be a good thing. At the very least you should have a choice whether to do that, but that doesn't seem to be how it's going to work.I wish I had bought a different VR system. I'm supposed to be able to return this one to Oculus for a refund at least. Their tech support is going to get back to me in a few days about that. Or at least they said they would, two weeks ago.

11-16-2019I believe some dishonest customer ordered the Rift S and then returned the box but kept the Rift S and sent back their old Rift (no S). This was then sent to me. It was obviously old and full of scratches from heavy use over time. In the future I expect Amazon to send me only brand new products, not old or returned items.A new Rift S replacement arrived 11-18-19 and will re-write this review when I have experience with it. I am including my review of the Quest first.QUESTI have been waiting for VR for years. I hoped this would be the one. It is not. I do like the overall software and the handsets.Cons:1) It is too heavy to wear and caused severe pain to my cheek bones. This is because it includes both the computer hardware and a battery.2) The display resolution is very poor. It should have two OLED 4K screens.3) From what I have read, the support is poor.4) I should have the option to switch to clear lenses so that I can see around me.5) VR is still not mainstream and thus has very little content.RIFT SThis overcomes the most severe limitations of the Quest:1) The headset is much lighter and much more comfortable since it is driven by my computer.2) The resolution is greatly improved.Update 11-22-2019VR is still not mainstream but the variety of programs is much greater. This my biggest concern at this point. I am not much into violence. I like simulations especially of a space. My favorite program so far is the simulation: Mission: International Space Station. I wish this would be expanded to include all of the ISS and more missions.Update 12-5-2019The only app that I have been able to use so far is Mission: International Space Station (see below). I just love being outside exploring with the jet pack. I will sometimes have it on for hours. When I take it off, my house seems like it is VR. lolI am comparing the display with my 65"" OLED 4K TV. The OLED would be great as space would look black instead of grey. It will be nice when the resolution comes up, in the future, as the stars look like blobs.. Despite this the 3D effect and zero gravity effect is just amazing. Thus far, this is the best app for me. The 3D and zero gravity take one completely out of this world. I would like to see other apps/games developed like this. It does not have to be a shooter but perhaps a spaceship for exploration with zero gravity inside and out.Personal Limitation: I have a disability that keeps me in a recliner almost 24/7. This limits my hand and arm motion from the waist up and to the sides, front, and up. I have tried other apps that I am unable to use because I have to reach down and the recliner gets in the way. I was hoping this would effectively get me out of the house. In a way it has but not as much as I would like since I have found only 1 app/game that works. This is interesting because Oculus has an entire section on their main page devoted to how this will help the elderly and disabled have a chance to get out of their environment. I see no action to implement this.Update 12-6-2019My latest note are the controllers (Touch). They run out of battery power too quickly with 1 AA battery. They need to be redesigned to hold 2 AA batteries each.My feeling at this point is that this is a first generation product. It is almost a design to test out on the market. I really, really want this product to work well but it does not. I do not think this will work well until the second or third generations come out in the future.Update 12-10-2019I ordered some high capacity rechargeable batteries. They are holding up much better. I no longer use alkaline batteries as their leakage has ruined too much equipment. I still think 2 batteries would be better.I continue to have a problem with the Guardian system. I am sitting in a recliner with chairs and tables around me. There should be a better system for sitting. I still cannot reach down and the barrier wall is not needed.Update 12-11-2019There is a bug with the popular Rec Room app. One is stuck in the floor where everyone else is above it.Update 12-12-2019Although this headset is lighter than the Quest, the wearing of it causes headaches that prevent me from using it for days. It needs to be more comfortable.Update 12-29-2019There is a popular social app that comes with the rift. Most people use it with their PS4 headsets and it works fine. When I try to use it, I am embedded in the floor. This may be related to setting the floor level and the barrier. Since I am disabled I am confined to my recliner and do not need a barrier. I can easily set the floor level but I cannot set a barrier as I cannot see all of the floor. This should be separated into 2 completely separate steps. People confined to a chair do not need, and cannot set, the barrier wall. Some more attention needs to be paid to these functions for the elderly and disabled.Update 12-29-2019I have not used this for awhile. I tried Mission: ISS and could not do the it. I wanted to go into Rec Room but there was no door to get out of my room. I am still in the floor. There were 2 updates and now I can't seem to do anything.Update 12-30-2019I tried the space arm docking mission again and was able to complete it. Also, using Facebook, I was able to get into Rec Room. I get the impression that most have been using the app for a long time and have their own circle of friends. I do not find the people kind to strangers. I am still evaluating it. I still wish it had OLED and a higher resolution but they are doing their best for now. It does require a powerful computer.Update 1-05-2020Now it is harming my computer. 3 times there was a long loud warning sound from my computer and the computer rebooted into the BIOS. I am unplugging it and uninstalling the software. I hope there is no permanent damage to my computer as it is a very high end and very expensive. With all the other problems noted above especially that it cannot be used seated, I am returning it. I will look at VR again in a few years. This has been a total waste of time and energy not to mention possibly damaging my computer.

Don’t get me wrong the headset is amazing! My cousin has one and we play some sweet games. Loads of fun BUT we got it when it was $399 not over $700 now. Honestly save your money and wait. Also saw one on amazon going for $1000!! For that I’d say get a vive pro lol. AMAZING product but just be patient. People selling for this much should be ashamed of themselves.

I began using the Rift S about 2 years ago. It was my introduction to VR. It's been an interesting experience, with many wonderful ups, along with a few frustrating downs. The system has lots of details that impress me, and several that disappoint me.Oculus is moving on, dropping the Rift S from its lineup, so there's a bittersweet edge to the whole story.I currently own a Quest 2, which I really like. This week, I officially disconnected the Rift S from my computer and packed it away in its original box, ending my Rift S story.I'm offering my experiences here for those who are curious about the Rift S, and, perhaps, as a way to think about Oculus in general going forward. I also point out where the Quest 2 does or does not pick up where the Rift S left off...GAMING POTENTIALThe potential capabilities of the Rift S were amazing. When it was working properly, the visuals were terrific. On pure visual immersion, I was impressed from the first moment I put the headset on. I never got into shooting games of any kind, but so many of the puzzle and problem-solving games I played were great.Just some shining examples... My 13-year-old daughter and I played Farlands for hours. Sadly, this game is apparently not yet brought to the Quest 2. We also played Beat Saber, Job Simulator, and several other games. I've been impressed with the development behind the best of the Oculus games.Of course, the Rift S experience is affected by the kind of computer system you own. I originally used this on a very under-powered system, because I did not know better at the time. I destroyed my old CPU playing a Rift S game and learned that I had to get a system with a proper graphics card. After that, gaming potential was much more impressive.GAMING REALITYNotice that the heading for my last section was ""gaming potential."" The Rift S clearly had amazing possibilities. But often, weird snags held it back from being a consistently great experience. Some of these snags were mysteries, some were frustrating. At first, I tried to solve some of them, then I just accepted them as part of the experience.The Rift S (and the Quest 2) have a setup, in which you establish your gaming boundaries and other personal details. It takes a few minutes to go through it, and it's a bit tedious. For some reason, every few days, the Rift S would lose the settings and I had to do it all over again. Sometimes, I needed to re-do them even after a day of use. Sometimes, after going through the setup, the Rift S would not accept the settings and I would get into what felt like an endless loop of setup, confirm, setup again.The connection required both a USB and a display port connection, which meant devoting two ports to the Rift S. Another reality was with the necessary connection to a computer. This meant dragging around rather stiff, inflexible cords, which over time get a bit twisted. During play, I would often find myself wrapped up in the cords. Given that the Rift S needed to hook up to a computer, I understand this was unavoidable. But it was a downside.Another hindrance to pure game play was controller battery life. I would put fresh batteries in the controllers, and in just a few hours they needed to be replaced. If I did not play the Rift S for a week, the batteries would still run down. It was easy to replace the batteries, but still seemed rather wasteful. This issue has been resolved with the Quest 2, where the controller batteries last for months.GAMING CHOICES AND REVIEWThe Rift S environment had a lot of great options, and Oculus did a good job of organizing the games in the online system. I found it easy to identify which games were available for the Rift S, how much they cost, see an overview of the details, the cost, and user reviews. The games installed easily. This part was always very smooth. It continues to be a great part of the Oculus experience with the Quest 2.COMFORTThe Rift S ""Halo"" headset was one of the shining achievements of the system. It's very comfortable. It fits quickly and securely on your head. The face padding is soft and accommodating. And the tightening knob is smooth. The headset blocks out light from all sides, allowing you to immerse in the gaming experience. Because the system is driven by your computer, the headset itself has relatively little hardware and was very lightweight. I could play the Rift S for up to 1.5 hours in comfort. By contrast, the Quest 2 headset feels heavier to me. Also, the head strap that comes with the Quest 2 is terrible. Even after trying numerous after-market Quest 2 head straps, I have yet to find one that equals the comfort of the Rift S. I wish that Oculus would just adapt the Rift S Halo headset to the Quest 2.SUPPORTFrom the beginning, it always felt to me that Oculus did not give the Rift S the kind of attention it needed to shine fully. The software often felt a bit underdeveloped. Besides the specific issues I mentioned above, there were always just a bunch of small hangups and operational glitches throughout the time I used the Rift S. I submitted feedback and service requests to Oculus, describing the issues, but never got much feedback about it. At this point, with the system being discontinued, I would not expect these to be smoothed out.FROM RIFT S TO QUEST 2For the most part, I've accepted the need to move on from the Rift S, and I'm generally happy with the Quest 2 as the way forward. The freedom to move around without wires, and to be able to play games without needing to dedicate a computer to it, are definite advancements.Considering general game play, and comparing the same games played on Rift S and then on the Quest 2, I'd say, for pure visuals, the Rift S wins (once I hooked it up to a powerful gaming PC).CONCLUSIONSAt its best, the Rift S was an amazingly capable and comfortable VR system. I fully enjoyed it when it was working at its peak. But its immersive experience was often interrupted by its glitches. There were days when all the time I had for VR was dedicated to just solving a glitch in the system. And the lack of support from Oculus was always frustrating. For me, the Rift S will be remembered for ""what could have been.""Whether I do or do not like the Rift S is somewhat moot now, as Oculus has made the decision to cancel the system. I look forward to what Oculus will develop in the future. For the moment, I'm happy with the Quest 2, but disappointed that the Rift S was not developed to its full potential.

TL;DRI’ve personally had a great experience with the headset. Launch of the Quest 2 made Facebook start forcing the need for an account. Without an account the headset becomes a paperweight. Seems like a make-or-break for some, which is understandable. Facebook/Oculus going all in on standalone headsets, Rift S is being discontinued sometime early next year. Support for users will still continue. Price is worth it, but if it goes on sale after discontinuation, it would be even better.————————————————————I bought it directly from Oculus. This was my first time stepping in to VR. It’s been about 3-4 months of use now. I love it, truly I do. There’s some kinks here and there, but overall I’ve had a very good experience. I bought a few extra accessories. Pulley system, grips for the controller, VR Cover for the gasket, and a 3D printed headphone replacement from Etsy that works perfect. With the launch of the Quest 2 Facebook started forcing users to have a Facebook account to even use their headset. Or your headset basically becomes a paperweight if you don’t have an account.It seems like that’s a make-or-break deal for people, which I definitely understand with how Facebook is. I still have a Facebook that was gathering dust since about 2015 that I occasionally logged in once every 6 months and would disappear from. Unfortunately, with the release of the Quest 2, Facebook/Oculus is discontinuing production of the Rift S and don’t plan on making VRs that need a PC to operate. They’re going all in on their standalone headsets. This doesn’t mean all support will be gone for the Rift S. But this does mean there’s a chance these might go for sale, while I believe the price is already worth it, if you can get it for less, why not.

Oculus has done it again in providing an excellent PCVR solution at a price one can afford.The Rift S improves on its predecessor in nearly all ways and is truly a joy to use with its super fast setup, comfortable headstrap, flexible audio options, ultra clear screen, and a revised version of the legendary touch controllers.Sensors begone!  No longer do you need to clutter your desk nor mar your wall with sensors, the Rift S does it all with inside out tracking and the tracking experience is extremely similar to a 3-sensor setup on the old Rift.  No longer do you need to worry about a long recalibration process after your bump or tug a sensor, and this is a great thing to not have to worry about.  Also, now everything works via 1 USB port instead of 4, so if you have a gaming laptop with usb3 and displayport that meets the min requirements you can actually use Rift S in portable fashion with its super fast setup.The ""halo"" design headstrap simply floats on your head once it is adjusted properly and it is a joy to use compared to the old system where the straps did not provide enough support resulting in fatigue over time.  With the Rift S you can use it for hours on end without any issue.The audio is much different from the original Rift, in that small speakers replace the headphones; while this reduces the bass output, it allows for more environmental awareness and more convincing positional audio.  However, for those that like headphones better the Rift S also has a 3.5mm headphone jack; this flexibility in audio options that hte original Rift did not have is great as those who like speakers better can use the default setup while those who like headphones can add headphones of their choice.The screen and lenses are also a revelation compared to the Rift.  Ultra clear, super sharp screen to which the old Rift pales in comparison.  The ideal IPD range for this screen is 61-66mm (know your IPD!) though even those outside this range still will likely prefer to the screen due to the large lens sweet spot combined with the massive clarity improvement.The touch controllers here are extremely similar to the ones with the original Rift except the ring is inverted to accomodate the inside out tracking.  It take a bit of getting used to due to the shift in center of gravity but these controllers do a spectacular job just like the original Rift controllers - in fact I'd say the button placement is slightly more intuitive as your thumb naturally rests on the main buttons resulting in less wrong button presses.There were some bugs at launch but most of these were fixed in the recent v1.38 patch.  A lot of the remaining bugs can be tied to problematic USB controllers, and buying a quality USB card such as the Inateck KTU3FR-2O2I can remedy this for people with misbehaving USB chipsets.Overall, like all cutting edge technology there are a few bumps in the road, but at the $399 pricepoint Oculus truly demolishes the competition here.  I look forward towards more affordable and innovative PCVR headsets from Oculus!!

I have owned the original Rift (CV1) since July 1, 2017. I don't remember when I purchased the Rift S, but that isn't important. I built my current rig especially for VR and gaming in general. Yes, I still play 2D games. I am giving out this information to let people know that I am a past, current and future VR user... hopefully, as I am 60 yrs old. Yeah, a 60 yr old gamer, I am not alone. I have been gaming since ""Pong"" came out in 1972. Okay, enough about me.What is important to know is that there are a plethora of different PC builds, too many to count. So, for a company to roll out new technology for the PC market, it cannot possibly cover all of the different PC builds that are in use. So, what does it do? It covers the general builds. We are then tasked with tweaking what we have to fall in line with what they know to work. But, it was released too soon. They didn't beta test it. I'd have to say that statement is true, to a point. Again, too many different PC parts/builds to test. So, we test it for them. We are the beta testers.So, as we find problems/issues, we report them and get pissed off that ""the thing does not work"". Well, open a ticket, send your logs and hope for the best. While waiting, research the issues that you are experiencing. Go to the Oculus website and try the various fixes for your issue. It could just take a couple of small system changes to get it to work. I'll get more into that later. If it isn't working and your return window is closing, return it. There are some bad units, as with everything. NOTHING IS PERFECT, except love.There are many people buying this that have little to no technical knowledge. There are many people buying this that have not researched what is needed to run this. Many people today rely on plug and play. ""I should just plug this in and go"". Not so fast, my friend. This is still new to many people. Even those that work in ""IT"", will not understand, unless they work specifically with PC's. There is a different knowledge set that is needed.What I've noticed when reading about the problems is that a lot of motherboards have weak/bad USB 3 drivers. The Rift S pulls a lot of power and needs good/stable drivers. Oh and if you have your keyboard and/or mouse plugged into a USB 3 port, why? They work just as well in a USB 2 port. You will be drawing power away from your Rift S. Many people find that a USB 3 powered internal card fixes many of their issues. It worked for me when I used my CV1. I don't need it for the Rift S. Cheap/inexpensive motherboards are the main culprit. ""Hey, I picked up this motherboard on the cheap and it has all of the bells and whistles of the expensive boards"". Think about that for a minute. They have to cut corners somewhere to get the price down. They use lesser quality components to do that. Yes, some ""less expensive"" builds work, but quality builds have fewer problems, especially when it comes to USB 3 drivers.READ (and understand) THE REQUIREMENTS BEFORE BUYING. The uptick in graphics needs the DisplayPort connection. Computer technology moves fast and leaves older systems behind. You have to ""keep up with the Jones'"", if you want to use VR. PC gamers already know this. It can and will be expensive. Yes, the minimum specs listed will run VR, but not well. Never try for the lowest upgrade possible. VR needs a stable PC environment to work well. The best advice I can give is to educate yourself before making the leap. VR is worth it.The main known issues that are preventing many people from enjoying their Rift S, other than the USB 3 issue:USB 3 ports turning off. I do not want to go into detail here, as there are directions on how to do that in other places. It's an easy thing to do.Microsoft/Security software not allowing access to the cameras. This is a privacy issue. The default is to not allow access. Check, both, Microsoft settings and your Internet Security settings.Update your Graphics Card drivers (GPU) by going to the website for your card. Just clicking the ""Update Drivers"" button in Hardware Manager will not get the special drivers needed for the Rift S. Find the one listed for your specific card, download and install.There are various other things that may be going on with other builds.LAPTOPS - The Rift S isn't built for laptops. However, there are a few that will run it. They are expensive. The main problem from what I've noticed is that older laptops do not have a DisplayPort. Some do have a mini-DisplayPort and Oculus includes a DisplayPort to mini-DisplayPort adapter in the box. The other problem with many laptops is that it lists the laptop as having a GPU that will work well with the Rift S. However, the GPU listed is running the laptop display, but the exterior connection port does not connect to it, but with the motherboard integrated graphics and that is bad. The motherboard integrated graphics are not nearly powerful enough to run VR.HDMI to DisplayPort adapters do not work, for the most part. There are two kinds. There are passive and active adapters. The passive just changes the shape of the connector to match the port. It cannot raise the throughput to match what is needed for the Rift S. I do not know if the active adapters work. From what I understand, they are expensive. I would like to know that myself. I'd rather not give out bad/false information.This was just meant to help in a small way. Please let me know how I did and if I need to change something. I don't consider myself to be an expert in anything.Live, Love and Learn.

Whatever could go wring did go wrong, and it was mostly driver related.  When installing I ran setup and soon received the  ""Headset Sensor Check"" error. Tried changing USB ports - I have 12 built-in (USB 2 and 3) and an additional 4 on a card I purchased just for 3.1 - none worked. The card has additional power, so it was not a power issue.  Rebooted, changed USB drivers - everything. Went online and someone suggested setting computer camera access to ""on."" My computer does not have a camera, so no way that was it. Annnnnnd - THAT was it. Set this to ""on"" and instantly the sensor check error vanished. Included a photo of the screen. USB problem solved.The rest of the install went without a hitch. But it's the slowest install I have ever seen - 10 minutes watching a countdown of how much is installed. It crawls.The headset and controllers needed firmware updates - took under 5 minutes.So I went to run the headset console - and received a video driver error. Very generic. Photo included. My driver was only a few days old. Updated it. Rebooted. Then received a ""Vulcan"" driver error. Removed the drivers, tried again. Same thing. Went to the Nvidia site and found a newer driver (for some reason it did not auto install) that specifically mentions Oculus S support.  Installed it. Yep - instantly worked. Now everything was working. Two driver errors solved.That was a few days ago. Over 18 hours of use and zero errors or problems.The cable is a bit of a nuisance, but unless you go with the Quest you need it. But it's only one cable with two connections at the end (DP and USB.) The video quality is awesome and there's rarely any halo effect on the lenses. There's even flaps on either side of the nose opening to block light. Sound is good, but as you expect a bit tinny.  There are headphone jacks on either side of the headphones, so using your own earbuds or headphones is easy.It's also surprisingly lightweight and the fit is really easy to adjust. If you have other Oculus sets, be aware that not all games crossplay - this is especially true between the Quest and S.Next up was Steam VR - and, yes, it works - so you can get content from Oculus or Steam.Controllers: Lightweight, each powered by a single AA battery with a magnetic door. Use the lanyards. I've released one more than once when I dropped items in VR.I've played Beat Saber and a couple of shooters, but have spent way too much time in Google Earth VR. It's crazy fun to Spiderman between skyscrapers or fly the grand canyon at night.One of the best parts is having other people use this for the first time - I have had a couple scream in surprise and try running out of the room. Seriously.One complaint - because the S is so new, Oculus support is SLOW to answer - I solved my problems myself. It's been days and I did not hear back from Oculus. So you're stuck with self-help and cruising the support groups and YouTube. Fortunately there's plenty of help from other users. Good thing, because the FAQ/Help page is shocking short.Finally, setting up the play area is easy, and the passthrough video is amazing.  Stick your face slowly past the warning grid and watch your surroundings appear.  I have it setup so a double touch to the menu button activates passthrough. This way I can grab a drink, etc.My computer is pretty old, but was high-end four years ago. The video card is new - Nvidia 2070ti.

So I see mixed reviews on this headset. I think you have to take these with a grain of salt. The price is $399, which is incredible. For anyone concerned with value for your money, the Rift S is the only way to go, or the Oculus Quest now that you can plug it into your computer for PC VR.I am updating this review as of October 2019. So what changed? The updates Oculus have put out have been amazing. The tracking has been drastically improved update after update. It works great. The visuals still look great, the screens are sharp, the controllers are nice. The headset is comfortable to wear and accommodates glasses. The audio is still not great, so you have to get headphones you can attach to it. All in all though, the Oculus Rift S is a great VR headset for $399.

I was really disappointed when I found this in a brick and mortar and drove the 60 miles each way to get it this past weekend...  I was happy it was in stock somewhere local at least so I didn't have to wait for stock to refresh, and at this particular store that was the only one within the 250 mile search radius they will do.  They didn't have it the day before, so clearly I had perfect timing that Friday night finding it.I've had the consumer version Oculus Rift since debut, with an Asus ROG 20 gaming system with a higher end graphics card than required and an i7 processor.  So the things run very smoothly on it.I hadn't used my Oculus for almost a year and pulled it out again, saw some of the new games, and figured, ""Let's get the upgrade.""  Since I have no need for the mobile Quest version, I went with the full tethered S version.  I know there's the Oculus Link for the mobile one to let it do some games from a PC as well but it still won't be able to do all of them, and for me it was more important to have the full ability, not mobility.  Others have different needs...I disconnected my CV1 Rift, and all four sensors (since I had it set up for room scale VR) and plugged this in.  Fortunately my Nvidia card had a display port as well as the HDMI.  Rift was recognized instantly, updates installed, I was on my merry way.Games looked better, no question.  Not night and day better, but definitely an upgrade.  But for me, I instantly loved the COMFORT of the new halo band.  Wow, it sits better, FAR easier to get positioned correctly, and just feels so much better.  Also, no need to stuff kleenex around the nose opening to keep it from fogging up.I played that evening for an hour or two, enjoyed every minute of it.Then I learned that they have SO MANY of the same issues we dealt with at the launch of the CV1...  The next day it was TWO HOURS before I got the computer to finally recognize the Oculus was there.  I was caught between the endless ""oculus software needs a restart"" loop and the infamous error about no display port detected...So for the entire weekend, it was a mixture of those two errors making it nearly impossible to play.  Sometimes I had about 45 minutes before I had to go somewhere.  Couldn't play, as 45 minutes was never long enough to get things working.  I did all the fixes, all the suggestions, and still have nothing but problems.I did find that reinstalling the oculus drivers has a better chance than almost anything else of making it work again, but it still fails more than it succeeds..This thing has been out I think since March, and it's now the very end of December.  9 months and we're still dealing with the poor software and all its inherent failures that we dealt with when CV1 released.  Seriously?  All these years later and we still can't get a device that, if it worked just four minutes ago when I took it off my head, can't work NOW, without 2 hours of a fight to get it seen by the Oculus software?As usual, they have a decent product out there, and they can't write software well enough to get out of a wet paper bag...

I bought my son a Rift S for Christmas in Nov. 2019. In June/July of 2020 it started freezing up and having tracking issues. I started dealing with the Oculus tech support dept. at that time. They'd have me try one thing, then another, which would work for a little while, then I'd start having tracking issues, again. Fast forward to Dec. 2020: After about 5-6 months of multiple ""hoops"" I had to jump through, sending files, sending data, trying updates, updating software, back and forth with Oculus support, they FINALLY decided it was a hardware issue. I mailed the Rift S headset back and it was received on Dec. 29th 2020 (according to my tracking info). I didn't receive any confirmation messages, so I contacted them on Jan. 5th, 2021. They said they had received it just that day. Hmmm. They said allow several business days for a replacement to be mailed out. On Jan. 15th I contacted them again. On Jan 18th they replied saying I should allow another 8-12 business days for a replacement and they'd notify me when it shipped. So, it could be the first week of Feb. 2021 before I receive my replacement?  If I had known the absolute headache it would be to get a replacement headset (so glad I purchased an extended warranty), I would've opted for an HTC Vive, instead. I don't think I have ever had such poor service from a company this large, ever. Even though the Oculus Quest I bought has been great and had no issues, I would NOT recommend buying any Oculus products due to their horrible customer service and the sheer amount of hoops you have to jump through to get yours fixed or replaced. If you DO buy one, be sure to get an extended warranty. If I had not, the warranty would've run out during the time I was trying to get answers from their tech support department.

After the Quest 2 is released and the Rift S is discontinued I see this is not worth buying any more at this price point as the Quest 2 is 100$ cheaper with wireless capability and also supports linking to a PC,For:+ Guardian Setup is easy and it's synced to my account even after buying a new Rift S I didn't need to redo the setup again+ Sturdy strap+ Various games to choose from on PC+ Cheap+ Controllers are very good and accurate+ Replaceable controllers batteries - some people are complaining that this is a non rechargeable battery but I find it best as is as rechargeable ones will sooner or later die and it will be expensive to replace, and you can still buy energizer rechargeable batteries and use them in the controllers as I do.Against:- Price Point after Quest 2 is released- Resolution is still not that sharp (was a deal breaker for me)- No hardware IPD adjustment knob only software which I found that it almost does nothing I don't feel any difference changing this from 60 to 70+ no difference in the screen- Build in speaker quality sucks- Discontinued

Check the forums, reddit, etc: pairing your Oculus device with a Facebook account may (for reasons unknown to anyone) land your FB account indefinitely suspended.I had a FB page since 2012 with zero issues, and upon switching over to the now required FB login to use a gaming peripheral (?!) my account has currently been suspended for three months with no reply from FB or Oculus support so far. Turns out there are hundreds of people this has happened to and zero explanation from either company.Feel free to roll the dice - I did, knowing they were going to institute the facebook requirement - but be prepared to throw this thing on eBay and lose $100 in the process.The Odyssey+ has the same FOV, larger resolution, better colors, a higher refresh rate, and less screen door. The Rift S has a higher build quality (thanks Lenovo), better tracking, and compulsory spyware that will randomly betray you. Neither have much for aftermarket support and will require venturing off the Amazon reservation for parts/accessories.Do everyone a favor and vote with your dollar: don't let Facebook bully yet another group of people with their policies. Go Samsung, HP, HTC or future proof yourself with Valve.

The Oculus Rift S is a powerful VR headset that is very much well-supported with its own internal tracking, crystal clear audio(headset speakers), and the high res screen of the VR headset itself. For a whopping price of $399 you cannot go wrong with this. Also the Halo head adjuster is by far the easiest VR headset to adjust, compared to the HTC Vive. I understand it’s not an upgrade to the original Oculus Rift, by for newcomers to VR looking for the perfect headset you can afford and can compete with the high-price headsets. The internal tracking also does not lose the grips when you put it on the back of your head. You do need some ambient lighting for the internal tracking to be at its best, but that’s all fair game. This headset is completely underrated and definitely deserves a 5/5

I rate this as one-star because it's a Facebook product.  My facebook account was taken over by an unknown person and Facebook has been COMPLETELY unresponsive in my pleads to help protect my identity and that of my children, family and friends.  The Oculus team was no help in getting the situation resolved.  Multiple requests for tech support to gain control of my Facebook account were left unanswered and without resolution.  DON'T SUPPORT FACEBOOK BY BUYING THIS PRODUCT.  The only way to make a stand is by making it with your wallet!

I saw this product as a recommendation for Christmas gifts at full price and thought it was important to mention some things (as of October 2020)I was lucky to get mine from Best Buy when covid hit and since then I've learned a lot more about how the VR industry is evolving. Now is a good time to get into VR, there are several great titles (No Man's Sky, Half Life Alyx) and some good free options too (VR Chat, RecRoom). I won't recommend this particular headset for a few reasons...* Facebook is dropping support for this model in a year or so. It seems like Facebook is dropping out of the corded PC VR altogether.* The Oculus Quest 2 is brand new - both cheaper, far more powerful and about to become the industry standard. It does not need a good computer to use as it is a standalone product. You can use a cable to play Steam VR games that are not available from Facebook/Oculus. As a standalone system it is also cable-less which is really useful if your computer area does not have a whole lot of space but your bedroom or living room does.* If you prefer using a more powerful PC to have PC VR, or you have issues with the way Facebook conducts business the HP Reverb 2 is set to be the most powerful/visually advanced headset and is shipping out in November/December. Its $600 which is cheaper than the existing best set - the Valve Index ($1000). The controllers are a little chunky though like Windows Mixed Reality.*If this is a good price point for you, or is generally more available than the other models at least wait for it to go down in price. $400 is not tenable for technology about to become out of date/irrelevant.*Do NOT automatically assume that your pc can run this even if you bought one that says ""VR Ready"". This unit has a history of being funky with certain motherboards (even if you have the right USB ports) and I had to spend a lot in upgrades before I could get it ready to work right. A lot of time trying to find solutions and browsing message boards with other peoples experiences that could have been better spent doing other things. Try searching your specific motherboard and see if other people have confirmed it works.*My unit is about 6 months old and one of the controllers have started squeaking. The foam covering, which is already not generous enough is starting to come off on one side. My face has lines on it after using it...just generally uncomfortable.*In general I absolutely LOVE VR once I could get it to work right, its an incredible experience. Many games have a choice of teleportation as a form of moving around, if VR gives you motion sickness try this first; there's a good chance you will get used to it and be able to use normal movement later.*If you're a Star Wars fan, Squadrons released recently and is absolutely incredible in terms of ""feeling"" like you're a pilot in a tie fighter/x wing. I just wanted to add that XD

I have had the Rift S for over a year, and I absolutely love it. It is not the best PCVR Headset, and might be past it's prime if we are being honest, but it is still a solid buy, at $299 today.I also have the Quest 2, which is actually my primary headset that I use today. If you have a good wifi connection to your PC and are willing to purchase all of the accessories necessary to get the Quest 2 running the way you want to use it, the Quest 2 is the better HMD (Head Mounted Display) but it cost me more than $400 after already buying the Quest 2, for me to get it to acceptably do what the Rift S does out of the box, and then surpass it.The Rift S  is not the best choice for everyone anymore. (It kind of was, in a lot of ways, prior to the Quest 2 unless you wanted to fork out $1000 for the Valve Index). I would definitely way it against the Quest 2 before making a purchase, and also take note of the fact that the Rift S is about to be discontinued by Oculus (if it isn't already) which will mean it might be harder to replace a bad controller, or cables. However I still believe it is the best choice for some, especially those who are just wanting to experience PCVR on a budget, and have a solid gaming pc with a Display port and USB 3 connections.  If you don't have a good gaming PC, or the necessary connections the Quest 2 is definitely your better choice.

I'm not even sure where to begin. Just to preface everything: I write all this as someone who loved ... LOVED the original Oculus Rift with external camera sensors, and I had ZERO technical issues with the original Rift during the entire ownership of the device. The Rift S, however ... has been the worst product experience I can remember. The first unit I got was defective, and would hang at the ""sensor check"" on setup ... I went through all the threads on Reddit and forums to no avail and eventually got into a back and forth with Oculus support for weeks with someone writing me e-mails with very basic troubleshooting questions, like had I updated Windows? Have I tried unplugging it and plugging it back in again?After two complete re-installs of Windows and a zillion driver uninstalls and re-installs later, I eventually gave up with Oculus Support and exchanged the unit at my local store. This unit worked instantly and bypassed the setup with no issues ... but then I experienced a new bug nearly every time I opened the Oculus software. My hands would hang in the air, there would be a black screen for no reason, there would be ""mystery digital lines"" across the field of view (later fixed by a software update). I again exhausted all the threads on Reddit and on forums, and went to Oculus Support again ...  no I wasn't using extension cables, yes I had enough light in the room, no I didn't have LED lights emitting a weird frequency, yes I had updated my drivers. Someone at my local electronics store recommended putting in a new PCIe 3.0 card. I tried that, and had improved results ... but I kept getting a new odd bug every time myself or my significant other tried using the device.This was the ultimate bummer, because the great thing about the ORIGINAL Rift was you could quickly throw it on and play a game of Elven Assassin / In Death / Superhot then hop out. With the Rift S, there was some new annoying problem to deal with each time you tried using it.Even when the unit was working, the new tracking system is abysmal. Those great moments of presence in VR where you feel like you are quickly firing off arrow rounds, or jumping to return a tennis serve ... guess what? With the Rift S, your tracking is momentarily lost ... this might only be a fraction of a second, but it means you miss returning a shot in a game, and it takes you out of the excitement.It's the same experience with the Oculus Quest - right when you are jumping to hit a ball, your controller is momentarily lost by the tracking system, immediately taking the fun out of the experience and taking the user out of their presence.Another final annoyance: You can't play this thing in a dark room. If you use Hue lights, you're going to need to put those puppies at above 50% brightness. I'm a huge space nerd and love playing experiences like Lone Echo and Space Engine, but it is not the same sense of presence when room light is flooding in under the nose hole of the VR helmet because the new tracking system needs a ridiculous amount of light. You can use infrared lights to overcome this issue, but it seems a lot of extra setup when compared to the previous tracking system that worked so well.

The oculus rift is such a cool product, such a game changer, that its a little difficult to know where to start.I am pretty tech savvy, and this was my first ""real"" VR system.  The TL;DR version is that I have found the Oculus Rift S to be amazing, easy to set up, and very stable ... if you have the right hardware.The Oculus Rift S has to be powered by a computer, and its ""one rift, one computer"".  There have been a lot of people who have asked if you can power two headsets with one computer, and the answer is ""not really"".  There are some complicated technical workarounds that could allow it, but you wouldn't want to do them.Because of this, the Rift S is largely a solitary experience in our household  Sure, you can go to any number of social apps and meet people and talk to them.  But if you want to play a rift game with your kid or your spouse, you will need two gaming computers.The hardware for the Rift S is well designed, clearly several renditions past the first generation.  The hand controllers are really the most amazing part of the system.  Its really cool to point, grasp, and push off of things in the game.  There are no leg sensors or controllers, so movement in games is generally handled by thumbticks.  A lot of games have you piloting something, or floating through space, and you don't notice the lack of ability to use your lower body to control things.Set up was very straightforward and very easy.  I didn't have any problems while I was running the Oculus software.  It worked the first time and every time.I was running this on a cyberpower PC gaming computer that cost maybe $750.  It has a nice graphics card that will support 4 monitors at once.  It turned out that the RAM it came with from the factory, which was only 8GB, was really too low.  Many games and apps ran fine but not all of them.  If a game or app didn't work, its because my RAM wasn't high enough.  I bought an additional 32GB of RAM (total 40GB) and now all the apps run fine.  I will upgrade to 64GB soon which is the maximum my mainboard can handle.The Oculus website has a ""checker"" that can see if your PC has the power needed to use the Rift S.  You can search ""oculus rift checker"" and find it.  I recommend that you use the tool to see if the Rift S will work with your existing setup.I did have some problems with the Rift S, and thats because I downloaded Steam VR.  Steam VR is a completely different ""operating system"" with many different game titles.  After I downloaded steam VR I started having certificate problems caused by my virus software and I experienced a lot more crashes.  I think steam VR has higher RAM requirements.  I'm not removing any stars for this, because while your Oculus will work with Steam VR its not something they produce and therefore they can't control it.There are a fair amount of cool ""free"" game titles.  We show everyone ""first contact"" which is a variety app showing a lot of things.  Echo VR (frisbee golf in space) and bullet train (First person shooter) are also really fun.  Then there are some good free apps on steam as well, like ""the lab"" (a variety game).  And there are utilities like Google Earth, 3D painting, social apps, and more... which are all free.  So you can have many hours of fun for just the price of the oculus Rift S.The paid apps vary GREATLY in quality.  Many of the paid apps are really good.  We've bought Fruit Ninja, which was surprisingly fresh and fun in VR.  We bought Lone Echo, a kind of puzzle game.  And I have a short list of other games I'd like to buy.  There are ports like ""skyrim"" which looks cool, and games where you cast spells by moving your hands.You can look at real life houses for sale, see a cirque du soleil performance, watch movies in a theater, visit colleges and universities.Its kind of like when you buy a 3D printer for the first time, and you realize all the things you can make.  Its a true game changer, a paradigm shifter.Some games are very tiring.  There is a flying game where you flap your arms.  There is minecraft, which would seem really tiring with all that mining (arm motion) but I haven't tried those.There can be problems with nausea.  This is caused by the conflicting feelings of motion and standing still.  I can only play for about an hour at a time, and then I feel a bit unsettled.  Most of us have almost fallen over at times, reaching out to try to grab some ""virtual"" handhold in a game.  But we haven't fallen over yet.The bottom line is that its great technology, the only thing holding this back is that its a very solitary experience.  We sit and watch what the person is doing on the PC monitor, but that does get old.  Oculus has a new ""all in one"" VR headset called the ""Oculus quest"" for a very similar price.  We may pick up one of those just so we can have some fun together.

There is no obvious screen upgrade, as the screen door effect is no better or worse than the original Rift. The controllers are by far a downgrade, as the ergonomics are gone, the shape makes little to no sense at all, and is only as such to make the inside out tracking work better... Placing the IR tracking loops in the oddest, most obscure place as possible. The tracking itself, not terrible, but not even close to as good as two well placed sensors from the original Rift Touch. And if you happen to be akin to a three sensor setup, as my main rig uses with the original Rift Touch, then this is simply put, terrible. The three sensor setup provides room scale vr without any interruption or tracking issues what so ever, they mount to any standard tripod or security camera mount... so placing them is super easy. And this.... this just isn't even close to being in the same ball park let alone game.  Behind the back tracking, not good... Quick movements and close proximity tracking, not good.  Hand to hand close proximity tracking... plain bad. Original Rift touch with 3 sensors, perfect at all times. With 2 sensors, perfect 90% of the time with a reposition needed time to time. This, well..... this inside out crap... it's crap. Now on to the headset... No more IPS adjustment, so that's just terrible and as stupid a decision as could have been made.  So that's crap and a clear loss over even dev kit rifts of the past.  But the big thing is that there is simply no gains what so ever to justify an ""upgrade"" for someone with an original Rift Touch. As the Vive Pro made it a clear step up from the Vive, rendering it sensible for someone to choose to upgrade from an original unit... this one almost does the opposite. It strips features away and then asks the same original price. I do have both, and the Rift S has been back in it's box, tucked away in a cabinet near a spare PC. It's basically that crumby, terrible, sticky, off brand controller you let your friends use back as kids when you'd play MK2 on Sega Genesis, all while keeping the good stuff for yourself. Well, the original Rift Touch is the good stuff, the Rift S is the ""Turbo Fire Mega 32 Button X-Treme"" from ""Blando"" controller that you'd let your little brothers friend with the gross hands use. It's just, ... it's a just a step down in every single conceivable way. It's VR Lite to the original's Pro VR. . . It's Console to PC... It's Mobile gaming to... no.. it's a board game to a PC game. It's just inferior. 3 Stars because it works and all.... but it's crap... and it's especially crap when compared to it's very own previous generation of the exact same product... so that, in all honesty, is the utmost worst type of crap. They stopped trying.

I love VR primarily for content creation and immersive narrative games and experiences and the Oculus Rift S has been a huge step up for me from the original Rift CV1 (which I also loved). I find the screen to be several times better than the original due to the increased clarity the inside out tracking provides shockingly good performance (better than it has any right to). I am very happy with my purchase!I find the S to be a more comfortable headset than the original Rift for most applications as the weight is more evenly distributed. It's not as tight on your face and therefore probably worse for fast moving games like beatsaber but the extra comfort and better facial ventilation make the trade-off worthwhile.The audio quality is worse with the off-ear audio piped from the strap but honestly for fully immersive audio I can use earbuds and get the same experience as the rift CV1. For everything else I find the off-ear design better because it is cooler (I run hot) and it allows me to hear my wife and my kids so it feels much safer. On that note, the visual passthrough option is a HUGE quality of life upgrade over the original rift. Being able to jump out of the game to look around and see the real world in stereo-corrected 3D is a HUGE benefit over taking the headset on/off or looking through the nosegap of the CV1.Overall the Rift S is a worthy upgrade for someone like me that values higher quality visuals and 360 tracking out of the box and actually needs to have my hearing more open and available to be able to hear if my family needs me.Final thought: The big downside for this headset is it does NOT have an adjustable IPD setting like the original rift so you must fall inside the the acceptable range to be full comfortable (best for users 61.5 - 65.5mm)If you fall inside the range and prefer the oculus ecosystem and experience like I do then this headset is by far the best price/performance value!

The Rift S does some things very well, and there are some things that really make you scratch your head. I am a Samsung Odyssey+ user, so all comparisons are made against that.Pros:+Really comfortable. Weight is great. The top strap makes all the difference.+Screen is very clear, the ""sweet spot"" is about 90% of the lens!+Headband has discrete speakers that actually sound good!+Headband works with over-the-ear headsets, or at least it does with my V-moda Crossfade 2.+Excellent tracking.Unfortunately having a comfortable headset and clear screen doesn't mean much when what you're looking at doesn't look very good.Cons:-Screen contrast is poor. Blacks are washed out. Highs aren't very high. The overall range looks to be very limited. It looks like you're wearing a very dark pair of sunglasses. This was such a major disappointment as it kills visual effects and immersion.-No IPD. This one threw me for a loop. The software adjustment didn't work either. My IPD is 67 which outside the range of what the Rift S is good for. Major oversight on this one.-Screen door effect. It's there. I know Rift CV1 users who say ""its gone"", and it may very well look that way to CV1 users. Coming from an O+ (where it's really almost completely gone) I can see the SDE plain as day.-Graphical glitches - the flashing white that people talk about affected my unit as well. It's not a huge deal as it lasts for about 0.5s but it's annoying and kills immersion.-Poor performance. Even with the total resolution in my application of choice (DCS World) being less than my O+, I was getting 25-50% less FPS in the same scenarios on the Rift S.Perhaps the last two will work themselves out as drivers mature. Or they could have worked it out before release. I wouldn't hang onto a product past the return period in hopes it will work itself out.There are some things about the O+ I really don't like and was really hoping the Rift S would be the answer. For now I'm sticking with my O+, it's poor ergonomics and sweet spot, but vastly superior screen quality and visuals.

I'm a long term VR user and still have the Ocukus Rift and Samsung Odyssey for sim racing and normal VR gaming.Rift S has definatly improved the graphics with virtually no SDE or God rays. It's a pretty significant difference between it and the old rift. Then add the fact of no sensors to pace in the room and really good inside out tracking with the headset and it's a great upgrade.The problem is the IPD. It defaults at 60 something and mine is at 70. It allows you to adjust it in the software, but it is barely noticable that you make an adjustment. Which means you are really not getting your correct ipd setup while which will hurt your eyes and eyesight I'm the long term.With the ipd maxed out I found I have to rotate the headset low on my head and have the screen a lot more upwards towards my forward to sit on the sweet spot.Also the sweet spot is tiny. It is only my estimate of around 2-3 mm before you move out of it.Thankfully the adjustment is really easy to do although it the rear strap always wants to close up on you when you take off the headset making you have to adjust it back everytime to reinstall it. Minor grip I know.Sound is horrible.  Its practically none existing. I heard it was quit but dang. Idly the Ocukus Quest is much louder, at l eww ast twice as loud as the Rift S is. You definatly need to use a headset.Tracking was great when it worked. My right controller lost tracking completely right after I started running through the tutorial and never came back.Controllers are very comfy along with the headset to wear and use. Although the battery box is still a little hard to get off from the slick surface which is a good thing as it shouldn't come off to easy in gameplay.Indo love that there is no sensors and super easy to set up with the inside out tracking. Also has a cool quick click of a button to bring you back to the real world which the Quest doesnt have for some reason. With the quest you have to step outside the boundaries to see the room again.All in all it's an awesome upgrade still reminding me I hate cords on the headset. Speaking of cords it's a display port now not a hdmi.Ok. Conclusion. If you want an upgrade from the Rift in graphics fadility, framerate smoothness, great tracking if it works for PC VR playing then the Roft S is a great choice.Downside is horrible sound that you want be able to hear over your ceiling fan in your room  lots of faulty units getting black screens and lost controller tracking plus the need for a display port for those laptop users.It's a lot of greats with almost the same amount of cons. I recommend you order from a store like Best Buy or Amazon so you can return it if it doesnt work.FYI. I bought my Rift S from BestBuy and was able to exchange it for a Oculus Quest with no hassle.Hope this helps.

I was an early adopter of the original rift and kept it for years. Finally thought it was time to upgrade and I wish I hadn’t! The hands keep glitching and getting stuck in place, forcing me to turn off and reboot the whole system. I can’t tell you how many times I have played the same parts in alone Echo, hoping to get past the point where the hands go nuts. Also, the headset doesn’t seem to fit right even though I have tried adjusting it in every possible way. It tickles the sides of my nose no matter what I do, which causes itching and really takes me out of the game. The speakers aren’t very strong either. With the original rift I really felt immersed in the games. This version is just a lot of constant distractions that keeps me from being able to get into whatever I’m playing. I wish I hadn’t wasted my money. Don’t buy!

This is an amazing product.  We have had it for two days, and so far have been blown away.  I have personally flown a fighter jet, visited the house I grew up in (google earth), and gone on a 1943 bombing mission.  The ""real"" effect is just beyond description.  It comes with simple tutorials that are so much fun my kids have done them three times each, and have picked up the concepts of VR interaction very quickly (they are 11 and 6).  Minecraft in a VR format adds a whole different dimension to the experience.Now, the ""be careful.""  I spent two weeks trying to get this to run on my two existing computers in the fall.  Even though I had a gaming computer that was two years old and another desktop less than a year old, no dice.  Santa brought me a new gaming computer that he made SURE would run this, and I'm glad he did, but it can be frustrating unless you really know what to look for.  I didn't, and had to get help.  Santa, and elves from Best Buy.  There are some great free apps, and some moderately priced content for purchase as well.  Educational and recreational alike.

The Rift S  marks, what I believe, is the first iteration of VR that is finally ready for the masses and prime time. While, it dopes have its own hiccups, it provides the best experience yet. That is why I believe, finally, that VR is ready for consumers to digest.Set up was relatively easy with a USB and a DIsplayPort cord. Here marks the difference between this and last generation Rift Models. Where it was HDMI based before, this is a departure, and might make some “Oculus-Ready” laptops well...not ready. Though I’m sure an ACTIVE HDMI to DisplayPort adapter would be sufficient, but again, I haven’t tried it.Coming from the PSVR, the Rift S is just as comfortable but the fidelity is phenomenal! The screen-door effect that I sometimes experience while using the PSVR is non-existent on the Rift S. I’m using a 2080 RTX, which is plenty powerful enough to drive the VR experiences. With the exclusion of the light house towers, the Rift S still tracks near-perfectly, and is now easier to set-up than before.THe controllers are easy to use and comfortable to hold. While I think the PSVR is the most comfortable headset, this is a VERY close second. It almost has the same head band design which I am a huge fan of. Motion tracking on the controllers are top-notch as well. All this combined really delivers quite an immersive experience.CONCLUSIONThe Rift S delivers stunning visuals and near-perfect motion tracking, which culminates to a high-fidelity VR experience that you will lose yourself in.

You read that correctly. A Facebook branded VR system has not a single USA based support agent. The only support they provide is a ticket system which can take 8-12 days to be responded to with their backlog currently (10/24/2020) I waited 13 days for my RMA label.Apparently, this is a very, very common reason for RMA as well. The video flickers and then all audio goes out. You have a few minutes to restart your pc before video goes out as well.I did all the troubleshooting tips with 3 outsourced support agents that were clearly running off a script and not fully understanding my problem. They kept repeating themselves, and not understanding the English I was typing.Mind you, through all this, I kept my cool, and remained vigilant that I needed help. When the language barrier was becoming too much, I asked if I could get a phone operator in the USA, or perhaps even just a chat based one, so that communication would no longer be an issue. I was told there are no USA based offices for customer care at this time, nor are there plans for one in the future. (I kept the logs in case anyone tries to deny it in defense of Oculus)The troubleshooting tips they had me do, oftentimes had nothing to do with the issue at all. It was a frustrating experience.After reading dozens of people trying to fix the same issue on the Oculus forms, Reddit, and other hardware websites, the most common fixes were a powered USB 3.0 hub, reinstalling windows, or even disabling rift audio since it's so glitchy.Oculus has known about this problem since release, but refuses to do anything about it, then provides a 1 star customer service experience at best. It is almost shameful not to have English speaking customer support when you know about all these technical issues, and know people will need help.I truly regret not purchasing a vive now. What a headache.

I have owned the original Rift since release. I enjoyed it very much. I was very excited for the release of the Rift S. Everything about it, especially the visuals and inside out tracking is a big improvement. I compared it back to back against my original Rift and the visuals are much better. The screen door effect is almost eliminated and I do not notice the drop the 80hz panels and god rays have been significantly reduced. The tracking is also very good and it is nice to not have to plug in all the externals sensors as I was using 4 for room scale tracking and it would act funny at times.With all that being said I am on the fence about returning it. For some reason Oculus decided to release the Rift S with TERRIBLE audio. Imagine a very tiny pair of speakers with no bass and almost no volume sitting about 2 inches away from your ear that you can barely hear in some games and you would be imaging a better audio system than the Rift S has. The audio is that terrible. It is a shame considering how great the audio is in the original Rift.I have ordered a pair of the PSVR clip on headsets that I read work well with the Rift S since they have a short audio cable that plugs in to the Rift S and makes it more like the original Rift. If for some reason this does not fix the audio problem then I will probably return it despite the much better visuals and very good tracking.To be fair Oculus said they are releasing a software fix for the audio. I am hoping this will fix it but I am not holding my breath as I am not sure how a software solution is going to add more volume and bass to the terrible speakers in the Rift S.Not sure what Oculus was thinking to release the Rift S with such atrocious audio considering everything else on it is so good.

Headline says it all. Maybe there were issues with headphones, there are many people complain about other electronics here and there, BUT it doesn't mean that such great headphone had to be removed, so people would spend more money on headphones that are not included and not as comfortable and good as on original RIFT. Would you buy a car without speakers these days??? apparently Oculus thinks differently. Will wait for VALVE Index VR

I do think that the headset is worth the asking price, but largely because of the controllers and how well the controller tracking works.the controllers are quality, touch sensors beyond pushing the buttons,  the controller tracking on the wmr headset would drive me nuts, they worked good enough but you got use to holding your hands out in front of you.the headset tracking, well honestly it is only on par with my experience with the wmr headset, you need a fairly well lit room,  the headset tracking on the wmr was pretty good.  The screen was faster on the wmr, but the colors and the blacks are better on the rift s so a bit of a trade off.the lenses are a great step up from the asus wmr headset.the oculus rift s headset is i little bit heavier then the wmr headset, it makes sense with the extra cameras, but i still wish it wasn't, no big complaints there.  the headphone jack on my wmr headset would quit working all of the time so i never used it, works fine on the rift s, the in headset speakers are way lacking on the rift s.my biggest complaint with the rift s was fixed by adjusting the rift s farther away from my face, when it is snug against my face i can see the corner of the screen with my peripheral vision and see it flash black every time i turned my head on the edges of the screen, so glad all i needed to do was set the screens a little farther from my eyes, it was almost a deal breaker for me.if WMR headsets had better controller tracking and better lenses, i would not have upgraded, and i wouldn't recommend it, it is looking like WMR headsets are becoming a dying project, so because of those simple irritating issues i would have to recommend the oculus rift s upgrade.  issues that seem like they would be so easy to fix.the windows mixed reality headset was $220 when i bought it, and the rift s is $400, i do think it is worth the price, that is still double the money, and the wmr headset just needed a few minor upgrades, lenses and better controller tracking.  i found the cheaper controllers of the wmr headsets just fine, but the battery life is way better on the rift s, and the controllers are quite a bit better on the rift s.i bought from oculus site. but i like to leave reviews because i find them very helpful

Love it! Got this for Christmas and I love it!I have the Index Value VR but that one is too much to set up since you need the sensors but this oculus VR already have sensor on them and it also has a camera to see what’s around you when you set up your borders and if you step outbound.I wear glasses so I need them even when I’m in VR and so this oculus VR is a perfect fit for my glasses compare to the index value vr. It a nice big spacious fit even with glasses on.The speaker on the VR is good but hey you can year your own headphone so that’s even better if you have a good headset with mic.It is a $400 VR compare to others and so I say this is really good.I do find myself lagging when playing beatsaber but it only happens sometimes.Don’t like how I need FB to log in but it’s fine cause I use my FB to log in to most of games anyway.I do wish they have a do to hdmi adapter for laptop or older version of GPU.Controller feel like it’s gonna fall out so I had to get myself a grip holder for them.Nothing really to complain because i got a good deal out of it and compare to my $1k VR this one works the same!

Let me start by saying that the Oculus Rift S is an exceptional device.  If you've never owned a VR headset before, this is a great starting point.In this review, I will address the commonly-mentioned pros and cons of the headset while also providing perspective from someone who has tried other headsets in the past but just now decided to dive into VR with the Rift S.While I am by no means a seasoned VR expert, I have tried an HTC Vive and the original Oculus device.  There were always 2 major barriers to buying a VR headset-1) Price2) CablesThe Oculus Rift S maintains the dramatically reduced pricepont of the previous Oculus Rift model and sits comfortably at $100 less expensive than the HTC Vive.  This is important because I find the Oculus Rift S to be a better model than the Vive and far less expensive than other competitors such as the Valve Index.But what really sealed the deal for me was the inside-out tracking, which means you no longer have to have camera stands setup in your room to relay your movement back to the computer.  Instead, the headset has all the cameras you need to track your movement.  This saves you a ton of hassle.The setup is far easier.  There aren't a million cords running to your PC and taking up all your USB slots.  And the big kicker is that you won't have ugly-looking camera stands and cords on your walls.I've used the Oculus Rift S virtually every day since it came out.  Many of those gaming sessions were for several hours.  While the inside-out tracking is not perfect, it is extremely good.  From time-to-time I will find a nuisance such as when Lone Echo asked me to put a space booster pack on my back, and I had to crane my neck as far around my shoulder as possible for the cameras to actually detect that I was putting the booster pack on my back. But this kind of problem is rare, and I haven't had an experience yet that broke a game.In general, you use the Oculus Rift S just as you would any other VR device, and you won't think twice about the tracking because it just works.  Inside-out tracking is a truly major advancement for VR that I think Oculus has pulled off really well.  I don't know how the industry could go back to a camera system after the Rift S and Quest.I think there's a lot of unjust animosity towards the Oculus Rift S by people who expected this device to be an Oculus Rift 2.0 whereas it's most certainly more along the lines of an Xbox One S or PlayStation Pro type of mid-generation upgrade.  But let's take a look at what is better about the device before addressing some of the critiques.There's no doubt that there is a better screen inside.  That seems to be virtually unanimous across everyone who has used a Rift S, but I think it's important to explain just why that's important.Keep in mind that at its most basic definition, a VR headset is nothing more than a fancy screen.  Therefore, the screen could arguably be the most important aspect of a headset.  Also keep in mind that the resolution on VR devices is remarkably low considering the fact the screen is merely an inch or two way from your eyes.  While you may be fooled into thinking the resolution is that of an HDTV, you can see each individual pixel without difficulty inside all of the existing VR headsets.This means any amount of resolution increase is going to have a noticeable improvement.  Text is much easier to read, and you can view things in the distance with greater detail.  These make a big deal when the entire point of VR is to be immersed in the world you are in.  On that point, the actual screen inside the Oculus Rift S is wonderful and a marked improvement over other headset models.I also own an LG OLED HDTV, which I absolutely love, and it is where I used to do my primary gaming, which is on an Xbox One X.  Having 4k and perfect black levels is stunning.  I bring this up because I am absolutely babied by the beauty of that display, especially when it comes to black levels and contrast.  In fact, I hate using any other TV in our house now because I can instantly tell the black is grey.So please understand where I'm coming from when I say that I have yet to question the black levels of the Oculus Rift S.  For an LCD display, I am very impressed with the contrast, colors, and black levels.  It may not be OLED quality, but it beats my M-series Vizio and my 32"" curved 1440p gaming monitor hands down.I also hear a lot of complaints about the audio.  And here's where I have to agree.  The headset's internal speakers are serviceable, but certainly not very good.  It's about on par with the speaker quality from a cell phone.  Personally, this isn't a big deal to me because we often use the VR headset when family and friends are over, in which case we use our external computer speakers.  When I'm playing by myself, I use truly wireless bluetooth earbuds.To me, this is the same problem every other screen device has whether it is your built-in computer speakers (if it even has any) or your built-in HDTV speakers or your cell phone speakers.  In all of these cases, you connect these devices to external speaker systems or headphones.  The Oculus Rift S is no different.  So it is definitely another expense you will want to factor in, but I would not criticize the headset over it.The headband was actually a bit more difficult to adjust properly than we expected after hearing how the halo bands were more comfortable and easier to use.  However, I've since found my sweet spot and enjoy wearing the headset.  I think this is going to be the most subjective aspect for anyone buying a headset as head sizes vary dramatically.On the subject of inter-pupilary distance (IPD), my wife and I are both at around 62-65mm, which is very close to average.  We've had no less than 7 people try on the headset (9 including ourselves) with the IPD set at 63.5mm, and nobody has mentioned any problems with how the screen looked.  But if you are going to get this headset, be sure to check your IPD first and make sure it is within the range that the headset allows for.One other complaint that I agree with is that the headset currently has either a manufacturing problem or a software problem that causes periodic screen flickers.  A grey static screen will flash for a fraction of a second and go away.  It's so fast that it doesn't impact gaming, and it's so infrequent that I really wouldn't have a problem if it never went away, but it is there.  It probably occurs once every hour or so on my headset, but it is quite literally lightning fast, and I just continue playing as if nothing ever happened.  I reached out to Oculus support today, but it sounds like they have not provided a solution to anyone for this problem just yet.  I expect they will either provide a software update that fixes the problem or they will have to swap out whatever the defect is such as the cable as this seems to be a pretty widespread problem.In summary, I find the Oculus Rift S to be a great introductory device into VR headsets.  It is comfortable, priced right, has a great screen, and offers an easier home setup with significantly less cables.  I truly believe VR is the future of gaming and much more (such as movie watching).  We seriously considered buying the Oculus Quest and even had it on pre-order at one point, but ultimately I'm more than happy with the Oculus Rift S as I didn't want to be limited to the game selection of the Quest.  With the Rift S, I can play Lone Echo and Onward and the upcoming games such as Stormlands without ever feeling like I'm going to miss out.There is an elephant in the room when comparing the Rift S to the Quest and that's the fact that the Quest doesn't require a PC connection.  Being tethered to my computer genuinely worried me with the Rift S, but I can safely say that the easy and affordable overhead cable management systems really make a world of a difference.  I've played games such as Robo Recall or Windlands 2 where I've spun around so many times that the cable looked like a curly-Q fry from Arby's but I never noticed the cable was there because the overhead cable management system worked so well.I wholeheartedly recommend the Oculus Rift S, and I am a bit disappointed to see as many negative reviews as there are becaues I believe it is a great entry point into VR gaming.  I don't have any regrets with my purchase.I'll leave on this note- I'm OCD when it comes to my tech devices.  I always have to have the best of the best.  I research products for days and weeks to determine what I think will be the best fit.  And I definitely have a high expectation for my devices when I receive them.  Afterall, I returned my aforementioned LG OLED HDTV 5 times because of vertical banding before I got a device I was satisfied with.  Not only has the Oculus Rift S met my expectations, but it has been really cool to have people come over and immediately start asking how they can get their own headset because VR is such a great, immersive experience.One way or another, definitely get a VR headset because they are an absolute blast.  I personally have found the Oculus Rift S to be an excellent device and would recommend it to others new-to-VR without hesitation.

Been a fairly dedicated user of the Oculus Rift CV1 so was eager to put the Rift S through its paces to determine if the upgrade for users of the older model is worth it or not. Here are the key improvements:1) Elimination of external sensors -- Elimination of stand alone sensors greatly simplifies the initial room setup and the internal tracking systems works great. Found the whole experience to be just as precise, if not slightly better (since the most recent July firmware upgrade) than the CV1's as tested on a variety of title ranging from 'Robo Recall,' 'Lone Echo,' etc.2) Enhanced visuals - Graphical quality has been nicely bumped up from 456 pixels per inch to 600 ppi. This increase is quite noticeable with more vivid fidelity (Beat Saber is more vibrant) and greatly reduced screen door effect.3) Better fit - the Rift S has an all new fit and mounting system patterned after the PSVR's halo ring. This allows for greater comfort, more precise fit adjustments and for me at least - now allows me to wear my regular pair of glasses which was impossible with the CV1 (had to resort to wearing contacts or using an older pair of glasses with a much smaller frame).Naturally there are a couple of nitpicks with the newer system:- Audio quality - lacks bass and volume when using the built in the speaker. Of course you can always plug in a pair of headphones but sometimes you want to keep your ears unencumbered and if relying on the speaker will find the experience underwhelming.- Build quality of the controllers - I realize that the new controllers are supposed to be 'upgraded' but they feel cheaper and less sturdy than the CV1's. They do work fine though.All in all - if you're considering purchase of the Rift S as your first PC tethered VR system than this one is a no brainer. If you're considering whether to upgrade from CV1 I would recommend it based on the enhanced visuals, improved fit and comfort and streamlined tracking system. Great system with a good and ever improving library.

I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my grandson (2019). I'm 60, but I've been ""in the business"" since I worked on the original IBM PC production line in 1981, so I'm no novice, and totally familiar with technology. That said, I read lots of reviews, and I'd built my grandson a new PC for his birthday (May of 2019, he was 14). He kept saying he wanted a VR setup, so although it might sound low end, the i3 8100 is a true quad core, and has plenty of oomph to play games (coupled with a GTX 1660 ti graphics card). Since I live out of state, setup ease was a big factor in my decision making process. Works VERY well (I made sure everything exceeded ""minimum specs""). So after a few months for him to use it (he likes ""The Forest"" and ""No Man's Sky"" on Steam) it has exceeded my expectations. He reports great usability, nice clear graphics, and no problems (other than ""racoon eyes"" from wearing it too much). If you are on the edge about buying this, I'd say go for it. Pretty much any new system with a decent graphics card will perform well, and you'll be happy with the performance and ease of setup. So for about $1000 he has a pretty decent and playable VR setup, just like he asked for!

The Oculus Rift S is a step-up from it's previous iterations.Straight out of the box, the system is easily configured. Just download the software from the manufacturer website, plug in the headset and follow the easily designed on-screen instructions.  The two touch controllers come paired to the headset straight out of thebox, requiring you to only put in the provided batteries. (Be sure tobuy some rechargeable batteries for the handsets)The previous Oculus Rift required the additional purchases of three tofour external sensors to track your movement in the play area.  Withthe Rift S, there are five built-in cameras on the front of theheadset which work in conjunction with the internal sensors of thehelmet and two touch controllers to track your movements. The rangeof motion with the touch controllers was surprisingly accurate and almost 360° . I was surprised to find that the touch controllers would not lose tracking, even when holding them straight behind me.The only blind spot I found was when putting the controllers rightnext to my face.The helmet itself is sufficiently padded and comfortable, even after an hour or two of playing.The Halo design allows for the helmet to be easily tightened and appeared secured even when quickly turning my head side to side.  The helmet also creates a good seal around my face, blocking external light, making my VR experience more immersive.I did run into some trouble though, due to the tight seal around myface after around 30 minutes, the lenses would begin to steam. I would periodically have to remove the helmet to wipe the lenses.After going through the VR setup, you jump straight into a quicktoybox demo, showcasing the capabilities of the system. This is where the differences can immediately be seen from the original rift.  The resolution/clarity appeared sharper and the colors were vibrant.Text appears clear and crisp, easily legible.The only noticeable downside is that contrast/blacks appeared washed out and grey.My only gripe with the Rift S, is the built in microphone and speakers.  Sounds appeared faded and lacked bass. Due to the Halo design of the helmet, my current over the ear headphones have trouble fitting over the side straps and getting a proper seal on my ears. The microphone was also an issue when playing multiplayer games like Onward. I was constantly rebuked by teammates because the microphone would pick up on the ceiling fan in the room, creating a low background buzzing noise. It would be nice to use my noise canceling microphone/headphones to keep ambient noise down. I've read online there is a headphone jack built into the headset to utilize in-ear headphones, but I have not looked into this yet.For a starting price of $400, the Oculus Rift S is great deal forpeople interested in breaking into VR.

I am a VR novice.  My experience prior to the Rift S was a 20-minute demo with the Sony PlayStation VR, playing Skyrim VR, and while that obviously does not make me an expert, that is my frame of reference as I try to review the Rift S.  As a piece of hardware, the Rift S is incredible.  Not having to set up complicated external cameras or base stations makes initial set-up an absolute breeze.  The Oculus software is intuitive and guides you carefully through the “guardian” program, the Rift’s first line of defense against you running into real world hazards while wandering through your virtual environments.Assuming you have a computer that can support the GPU/CPU intensive requirements of the Rift S, you will be taken aback by the overwhelming novelty of the various demos and programs available to you, both paid and free.  I have had the chance to demo the Rift S with a few different people who vary in their gaming pedigrees.  The experience that stands out the most was with a complete novice, who, once getting over the initial hurdle of learning to move and interact inside the virtual space, had extremely visceral reactions to some of the demos.  When standing on the edge of a virtual cliff, she felt the thrill of standing on the edge and when approached by a virtual T-Rex she cowered, feeling real anxiety.  That may seem laughable if you have yet to experience VR, but it really is a “one of a kind” experience.Unfortunately, the app and software eco-system is still developing.  Quality experiences are still limited, as most games available for the Rift S via the Oculus store or others are modified to be ¨backwards-compatible¨ rather than built for VR from the ground up.  This is a transformative technology and is still in a state of development and flux.  The ecosystem continues to grow and there are more products available every day to experience in VR, but the back catalogue is still limited, and it may be worth waiting a bit longer if you really want to get your money’s worth.

Let me start by saying that if you do not have a Rift then this will work but understand that this is a poor step into VR.Let's look at the Pros and ConsPros:The new screen is great.  The screen door effect is gone or very near close to it.The lack of towers is also a big plus.  No longer do I need 3 towers placed around my room.The Passthrough mode is pretty cool.  Double clicking the oculus button shows you the outside world.The Halo and display are much easier for people with glasses to wearConsEverything else.But seriously.The Halo is a PitA.  The need to adjust it each and every time you put the headset on and the fact that it is actually fighting against you trying to return back into the closed position while you are trying to put it on.The Speakers are abysmal. Who thought that putting tiny tinny speakers in the headset was a good idea.  The whole point of VR is immersion and this completely takes you out of it.  Now I need to buy a quality headset that fits over the huge plastic halo and have yet another wire hanging from my head and plugged into the headset.The touch controls are upside down and much smaller.  I completely understand the ""why"" of the inverted handsets but as a person who has had the CV-1 since release it is completely backwards.  I am constantly trying to roll the controllers over to put the circles on the bottom.  Problem is that the Cameras on the CV-1 need to see the circles to track so they have to be on the top.  I understand that this isn't a negative for some but for CV-1 users it will be a hard thing to adjust to..  But then why are the controllers so small?  They are made for kids.  Anyone with large hands will have a hard time with these as the buttons are all too close and in awkward places due to the size.The facemask doesn't breathe at all.  I will chalk this up as a negative to both the CV-1 and this one.  I am always hot.  So YMMV but the lenses always used to fog up on my CV-1 also until I got the VRcover set for it.  Then they never again fogged up.  This will also need that when it comes out and now I have to add the $50 for that into the cost.The new screen is also a negative.  The blacks are not true black.  The fact that it uses a single screen instead of dual screens means that it must have a displayport connection (which makes a large portion of VR ready laptops obsolete) for the data transfer speed. It also means you cannot easily swap players around in games like Beat Saber or others.  Now the IPD (Interpupillary Distance) adjustments are done via the software and you have to get out of the game and adjust it.  Also the adjustment is just numbers.  In the CV-1 we had a manual slide that moved the physical lenses and you could see.  They also had a set of lines to know if the headset was on correctly.  The three horizontal lines were for adjusting the headset up and down on your face that the 3 vertical lines were the IPD and you made adjustments until they were clear.Overall I am not happy with the purchase as an upgrade.  If you have a CV-1 I would not recommend purchasing a S.  Too many corners were cut to lower the cost but in doing so they lowered the quality.  If you don't have a CV-1 I would recommend buying a CV-1 if you can find one for a good price (Not used without actually putting it on your face and using it as the lenses and screens are easily damaged and not noticeable) then yes, buy a S but only as a last resort.

Ok if you’re looking to get into VR, I can give you a model comparison so you endup with the right one for you.This is not a paid review, just my honest opinion from experiences with them.Will appreciate if you click if you indeed found this helpful.The Oculus Go is an entry level headset.It does not require a computer to run and is this wireless.Affordable.Would be great for kids under 13.It’s not too complex or high end.Easy to pickup and get the hang of.There are no external cameras so it’s more of a stationary headset which is ironic given its name. (Go as coined in that this headset is wireless, it does NOT need a stand alone computer to tether to.)Will not get you moving around or exercising.Had one controller which is basic and easy however limiting.Can not upgrade. Good to get your toes wet.Not for hardcore gamers. Lighter than Quest by a bit.Samsung Gear Powered by OculusVery affordable.Does not require a computer to tether to.DOES require a smartphone to power it.By not putting all the internal to power it, they were able to make a very cheap and light headset.Will use your phones battery while in use.Phone can not be used while the headset is using it.Requires a compatible phone.Better phone will yield slightly better experience.Not for hardcore gamers. Good to get your feet wet at a cheap price tag if you have a compatible smart phone.Pretty light weight without the phone attached.Oculus Quest-Probably my favorite and best headset for the average person.This is a big upgrade from the two choices mentioned above.This headset has better specs, faster, better screen, visuals/graphics.This headset is ideal for casual gamers.This headset is good for most ages. Adults will appreciate this over the two listed above.The major downside vs. the two above is cost.Quest costs significantly more than the Go and Gear. In my opinion it is worth it for me but it isn’t for everyone.Quest has TWO controllers which ad a bit of complexity for some but make use much more fluid and in depth.Quest had external sensors/cameras that allow it to sense the environment around it.You are able to move and it will be reflected in game. This headset will have you moving and exercising depending on the game/app you’re in. Quest has the ability to define room boundaries as to not run in to or hit surrounding objects or walls.Quest is newer than both Gear and Go.Quest is fairly heavy as it is fairly high specs and is not tethered/powered by a computer or phone. It is wireless but a bit heavier as a result. Added weight did not bother me much but it may to some.Oculus Rift- This is the top of the line most immersive VR experience Oculus offers.This is for hardcore gamers or those where cost is not a factor in deciding on a VR headset. This has all the bells and whistles but at a cost. In my opinion a huge cost, both financially and more importantly to me limitations, mainly in movement and freedom.Rift requires an external computer to power it.This requires cords and as a result is not wireless and limits freedom and movements.It is possible to get tangled when fully immersed.You must have a fairly high end PC to run this well. A dinosaur pc you got on Black Friday probably won’t cut it and will not have fluid or quality gameplay.This would be a good choice for a hardcore gamer who already has a high end pc and would not need to purchase a computer just to power this headset.The graphics are stunning and your experience can be upgraded slightly by upgrading the pc powering it.To me I did not like how it’s not something you could just throw on quickly and you’re in the VR world. You had to make an effort and set aside time not just jump in and out for a few minutes. Not something you could travel with unless there is a high end pc near you.Overall the most graphically stunning and realistic.Storage size/GB’s - I have been asked which storage size I’d recommend. I can say that the lower storage will be fine for most. For those who get lots of games/apps, may want to upgrade storage size.To me personally, I’d probably get the smaller storage and just use the savings towards a future headset in a few years once they have improved drastically. Just my opinion.Please remember to click if you found this helpful

I have now had the experience of setting up two different Oculus Rift S devices. Both times have taken 6-8+ hours, multiple computers, and have been painful. First, this device is nearly incompatible with all macOS products. The provided USB 3 and DisplayPort cables are finicky and refuse to accept third party adapters. This means that Mac laptops, having only Thunderbolt or USB C ports, can't run this device unless a third party (including Mac here; non-Oculus is third party) adapter manages to sneak under whatever software detected my adapter.This problem is exacerbated since the only adaptor that is provided with the Oculus is DisplayPort to mini DisplayPort. Setting this up, I thought I was in luck since my SurfaceBook has that port (and, hypothetically, the specs to run it). Unfortunately, no such luck. First, it told me my computer would be able to support it after I updated all my drivers/graphics. No problem, I did that. No error was given for why it didn't work after all updates were made, the Oculus simply refused to recognize the port (which works every other place I use it).So I switched to a smaller desktop computer that had a native DisplayPort port hoping to avoid the adapter issues entirely. After installing all the software, it still refused to run past startup. Now, I'm waiting on a shipment of a cable to try it on a third, more powerful desktop computer with even better specs. However, I still haven't gotten this VR to work, despite 6+ hours of work.Moving on to the Rift S I did get to work - it was also a huge pain. The software had to be reinstalled a few times, complete with glitches, and the computer itself needed a few updates. This was annoying but not that big of a deal since it eventually worked on the original computer.Once working, the Rift S was solid. VR Minecraft will always be my gold standard for VR technology, and the graphics were more realistic than on other VRs I've used. The tracking also seems noticeably improved, which helped keep immersion. This VR also includes two quality of life features - speakers built in to the VR and a virtual 'play space' minimap inside your VR, showing your position in the real world to prevent accidentally running into walls.Content selection for the Rift S VR is growing fast. Games, movies, etc all have high pricetags - kind of reminiscent of the old app store, before microtransactions took over, but tend to be entirely self inclusive. VR files are huge and require a ton of space, so make sure to prepare for that.Unfortunately, the Oculus didn't work perfectly once it was gotten to run on this computer. After weeks to months of use, it began to develop some bad glitches, such as hijacking the camera and leaving it constantly on. These glitches were likely not malicious, but resemble a virus and were difficult to remove, requiring a partial restore of the computer.Physically, the Rift S looks and feels fantastic and high quality. The two remotes are comfortable and intuitive. Everything appears durable, and I'm not particularly concerned about the VR screen cracking due to multiple inches of plastic layered around it.Despite its high points, this edition of the Oculus VR is riddled with too many glitches and inconveniences to be worth it.

Worth what?The risk, that is to say - you are risking time..... & time is $$You are risking whether or not this will work on your PC/Laptop....  & whether or not you will like it..yes, there are risks involved....But, are there not risks involved with just about everything?You must ask yourself, is the risk worth the reward?And the answer is...… YES!  Most Definitely Yes!Because - with this one, when you win.... you win big :)I am running the S on an modified Cyberforce Viper Dedicated gaming tower that meets system requirements and it works great!So if you are sitting on tbe fence on this because others have had bad luck.... I would say just go for it, play the numbers,.... IMO the odds are in your favor, as long as you check your specs before hitting the go button that is.This VR experience is so much better than the ps vr I have been using for the past year or so...The visual clarity is amazing.... I cannot wait to try Skyrim.... & SO many others, the Oculus games library looks awesome!Once the is App installed, which can take up to few hours, you set up the headset which the takes just a few minutes, so easy a caveman did it,  yeah thats me I'm refering to..... and if I an do it anyone can.Drawing out your ""play"" area with the controller is pretty cool!I love not having any cameras or sensors!The sound.... yeah well, it could be much better no doubt..... but, it IS something that can be remedied & is not a deal killer by any means.I like the box it comes in, it is high quality & can be used as it's storage/transport case.IMO this is IT for now.... by that I mean the S is THE best VR system currently available...... and to get it on the market at this price IS a noteworthy achievement in commercially available VR ..... heck I spent waaaay more getting all set up with my ps system.The build quality of the Oculus S is top notch.... resulting in beautiful form with flawless function...The helmet/visor is lightweight & comfortable.... I played for hours without any neck strain.It is taking some time for me to get used to the Oculus controllers though, I am so familiarized with the move controllers I tend to favor their design....but in time I will adjust accordingly :)What I like do about the controllers though,  is the wrist lanyard/strap..... a very good idea!As I see it, the sound issue is not quite enough to detract a full star from this products worthiness rating... 4.5 would be fair if that were possible -But it's not, so -5 Stars + a Quality Product Recommendation

I have been intrigued with VR since reading about the Rift DK systems released starting in 2013.  I knew I wasn't going to invest in the tech until it survived until at least 2nd generation.  The outside in tracking with eternal sensors being required was also a major negative for me.  When the Rift S was announced with improved display resolution and inside out tracking I knew it was time to give it a try.I'm running it on a decent custom system I recently built with i9-9900K, 32GB, and GXT 1070Ti and so far performance has been great in all titles I've tried and the required 80FPS is no problem.  I had no technical problems getting up and running.  I installed the Oculus software, plugged in the USB and display port connection to my PC and it recognized it right away.  I put the headset on and was off to setting up guardian and then placed in the Oculus home environment.It has for the most part far exceeded my expectations for what I had anticipated VR to do for my gaming experience.  Honestly I was not expecting the level of immersion to be so high.  It's very easy to get lost in the VR world and lose yourself for a time.  My favorite VR experiences so far include Lone Echo, Project Cars 2, Assetto Corsa, Thrill of the Fight, and H3VR.  The headset is also very comfortable and I can be in VR for over an hour and not have any discomfort.The inside out tracking up close to the headset was an issue up until the last beta software release v1.39.  It was very hard to hold and aim weapons close to your head.  I'm happy to report that v1.39 has completely eliminated this issue and FPS shooters are now lots of fun to play.Some complaints:1) It seems to forget the guardian setup pretty often so have to go through it that when it's first turned on.  I'd say maybe 25% of the time this happens and I believe it has to do with the amount of light in the room and if the config has been saved at that light level previously.  It only takes <1 min but still an inconvenience.2) The built in sound is very poor with low volume and no bass but I use an external 5.1 home theater surround system so that's not a big deal for me.  I would definitely plan on at least getting some decent external headphones to use with it.3) Occasional white static flashes while in VR occur around every 15 mins or so.  I've gotten used to it but I'm hopeful it can be fixed in software eventually regardless because it's annoying.  Lots of complaints for this one online.Overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase and I feel the tech is sound and the software is now mature enough to recommend the Rift S.  Make sure to install Oculus tray tool as well for some cool additional tweaks and config options.

Son got for Xmas with a “VR Ready” Laptop that doesn’t have the weird display port the vast majority of computers also do not have. His laptop has the USB-C DisplayPort with Alt-Mode so we tried the recommended adapter with no luck. He is able to play on my desktop which has a $1000 video card that happens to have all the outputs but no luck on the laptop which is plenty powerful enough to handle the VR. Major failure on this product, will most likely be returned and I doubt I will purchase any future reiteration of oculus rift, hopefully some other brands do a better job of looking out for the end user and not their pocket book. Anyone who doesn’t know DisplayPort was created to avoid HDMI licensing fees, hope it was worth it.Any comments whining about how I dare write a negative review on a product because I failed to get the right machine needs to realize this is my review and my experience. Feel free to write your own and I am clearly not the only person disappointed in the failure of oculus to make an effort to make this product work with the most common outputs. They used these uncommon plugs to save a few bucks per rift and you are fanboing their poor decision making.

This is my first VR headset so I have nothing to compare to except for a few years back trying those cheapie Chinese crap headsets that you attached your smartphone to. :)  Easy to set up an Oculus account (and I'm old, in my 50's), there's a firmware update for the headset. They give you 2 free app/games - I have to tell you to make sure you download Google Earth VR - that's one awesome app. Make sure you set your floor perimeter as low as you can go to get the best effects with Earth VR. Also another free game called The Lab which you can get on Steam.  One word of caution: this can make you dizzy at first until you get the hang of how it feels and I'm not so sure how this would be if you're prone to migraines.The headset is surprisingly comfortable and I have no trouble keeping my glasses on when wearing it. When you first get it, make sure you take off the clear protective plastic over the inside eye pieces. The headset has no batteries, it gets its power from being plugged into your computer, the controllers use batteries (included).Also, before you invest in this VR headset, check out your PC at Oculus.com to make sure it meets all the requirements. I have 3 computers: an Alienware laptop, a 2 year old Dell gaming laptop, and a 6 month old Acer desktop. Only my Alienware met all the requirements. I was a little shocked the Dell Inspiron did not; it's only 2 years old. The Acer only met the Windows 10 requirement, even though some reviewers were trying to say this Acer was a gaming PC. It's not and I knew that.So my Alienware (about 1.5 to 2 years old) met the requirements and thankfully Oculus includes a mini display port adapter otherwise my Alienware wouldn't have been able to hook up.

I don’t think you should buy a VR headset until you have tried it out yourself at a store or friend’s house. They are all screwed up in their own way, and finding “the one” that is screwed up in the ways that you can tolerate is a hands-on adventure.We have the OG oculus and an HTC Vive, and just got this one in the mail about a month ago. Some observations:Requires a USB3 port and displayportDisplay is better and worse than the original Rift.  It is crisper, but it’s more difficult to make things out in dark environments.Face pad is much more comfortable and fits my face better, but I don’t think you can remove it to wash it, which may be a problem sometime down the road.  It’s also a pain to readjust it to get a good fit every time I put it on.Setup is a breezeEasy to setup guardian boundariesPass through is neat. I wish the others had it.  It doesn’t work that well for EVERYTHING but it’s still handy.I wish they had left the speakers out. Headphones are better and I don’t mind using my own cans -Not all headphones will fit because the headband is pretty thick-Inside-out tracking makes this easier to move than the original or Vive, and the tracking seems fine most of the timeField of view seems a little smaller than the original. I like the Vive better.The electronic IPD adjustment is not great. One member of our family cannot use this because of the IPD adjustment limitations. I hope the next one has moveable lenses.

I bought a new pc, primarily so I could finally experience pc vr. I got a rift s 6 months ago. It would have trouble being recognized by the occulus software occasionally, but replugging it in a few times or restarting my pc would solve it.HOWEVER, around January 2021 the occulus software did an update and now itsays the sensor check is failing and to try plugging into a new usb port on my pc. I tried that, I bought a new usb 3.0 pci card, tried every possible troubleshooting option on Occulus's site and on Reddit. NO CHANGE. I have had a paperweight for over a month. Occulus support tells you they will respond to you within 3 days... but they take over a week between responses and just regurgitate their troubleshooting faqs at you.Give another VR maker your money with better hardware and better support.

 I have an Index reserved for August 31st. I have sold my Vive and bought a Rift S for playing VR in the meantime, but now I am in love with it, I`ll probably going to pass the Index. I have a narrow IPD (60) but the carity and sweet spot is so much better that the original Vive. The blacks are surprisingly good and even, not to mention the screendoor reduction, and glare control. The lightness and the halo design really beats the Vive with the Deluxe Audio Strap in confort. About the cables, just pass them trough the strap headband, it will feel in the right place behind your head. Try the Mamut Grips on the Touch, to emulate the Knuckles controllers hand holding design. I also recommend buying the Plantronics RIG 500HX headphone, it is very light, great sounding, fits perfectly over the halo strap and it is cheap. Passtrough + makes easy to get and put it over. The tracking is great with the new 1.39 firmware upgrade, I actually had more ocasional jitters and hiccups with my gen 1 Vive Lighhouses. The only real downside comparing to my Vive is the horizontal field of view, it feels narrower and more squared, in the Vive it looks to me a bit larger and rounded.

When it works perfectly, this is a solid 5+ stars!! The problem for me is that it sometimes has some issues and I have to unplug the USB plug and then plug it back in. Part of it could be that I need to update my graphics card driver (I had to rebuild my computer and I just did so; making sure the bugs aren’t on my side). When it works, this is amazingly immersive, the sound is actually really good and it sounds a bit 3D BUT there is a little sound leakage. It also doesn’t get super loud, either. You need a fairly powerful setup (but if you’re looking at the Rift S, I’m sure you already know that).My rig:Ryzen 5 260016 GB Corsair RAM 2400mhzRTX2070 (but set this up on GTX1060 6GB)Oculus is installed on a SSDPros:Beautiful screen/graphicsImmersiveNice soundHeadset is well-made & comfortableControllers are nice (wish had rechargeable)Fair number of games/experiencesNumber of possibilities are endlessCons:Headset can get a bit hot for mePerfect fit can take time and testingIf you’re too close to the lenses you get smudgesBugs...software bugs. I think these will be ironed out, thoughYou can do VR chats with people, use a virtual desktop, play crazy games not feasible before, watch huge movies...so very much, you’ve just got to have a fairly strong graphics card and being an early adopter, patience. If the bugs get worked out, this is a super ridiculously awesome setup with the sensors built in. Highly recommended for people who love games.

I am a Oculus fanboy.  I have a motion simulator and love the rift on it.  The one thing that I didn't like was the screen door effect, but I always knew it would be a matter of time.  With great delight, I realized they had a new Rift S.  I couldn't wait to try it.  Unboxing it was a joy.  No sensors, and a sleek presentation.  Getting it set up was an ease.  So far so good.  The visuals came on and while it wasn't quite PC quality, it ""seemed"" better at first.  Then I got to the dark screens which are not black but gray.  Playing the awesome Star Wars game was a huge disappointment.  All of the contrast was knocked out of the dark scenes, almost hard to see. The original Rift had great blacks.  I know it has something to do with moving to LCD, which did remove screen door a little more, not all.  Trying to get over that we move to sound, which I can not get over.  It's WAYYYYYY to low, I can hardly hear it.  There is no bass at all.  Ok, well I guess I could put on headphones.  Nope, it's still low volume and cracks and chirps all the time.  The sound is an utter disappointment and enough to say no deal and send back.  If you have a Rift I would suggest waiting until they either add a headphone or redesign it all together.  This is an update, not a new model.  One more thing, while I did like the sensors being gone, I didn't like the heavier cable hanging from my head.  Overall it's a C product.

I initially upgraded from the original rift with a 3 sensor setup to the Oculus Quest. After a few weeks using the Quest, despite the glorious benefit of a wire-free setup, I missed the graphics and higher framerates that a PC can deliver. (I tried the wireless streaming of PC games through ALVR, and unfortunately the latency and video quality wasn't good enough for me) I really wanted it to work, as I didn't think much of the Rift S given the mixed reviews. However, watching some comparison videos, and after purchasing it and using it in person, the Rift S, is, in my opinion, a substantial upgrade, especially with the beta 1.39 tracking update. In fact, hearing of the tracking improvements in 1.39 made be return my quest and put in an order for the Rift S.The Headset-The headset is incredibly comfortable compared to the Oculus Quest and the original Rift. I found the Oculus Quest to be incredibly uncomfortable. While though the sound is objectively worse, I have still found it to be adequate when I mirror sound to my speakers to get some extra bass. Regardless, the headset fits and feels so much better on the head due to the halo band and weight distribution. Build quality is alright, feels a little bit cheap.The Display-Starting off with the display, while LCD instead of OLED, it still looks incredible. I would say it is just as good if not better than the Oculus Quest, and it is most certainly far better than the original rift. I can read small text and I can watch HD movies in bigscreen pleasantly. The display is just really good, and while not perfect, is much better than the previous generation.Tracking-Inside out tracking must be worse, right? In my testing, with the latest Oculus 1.39 update, there have been very few to no tracking mishaps. The controllers and headset have tracked perfectly, even when held against each other or occluded. I can play archery games, I can play contractors, I can play Beatsaber on higher difficulties... tracking almost never drops out. Granted, your controllers are not tracked when physically behind you, but the scenarios when that is actually applicable is incredibly rare. My controllers are tracked when I leave them on the ground. Overall, I have found the tracking to be just as good as, if not better, than a 3 sensor setup in a 10x8' play space.You never have to worry about sensors getting bumped, setup is never a hassle. You just plug in, draw out a playspace, and are good to go. It has remembered my playspace even in vastly different lighting conditions, compared to my quest which seemed to often forget.1.39 Update-At the time of this review, this software update is in BETA. You must go into Oculus settings and opt in for beta updates. This update is a game changer, and somehow they've figured out how to track the controller in seemingly untrackable situations (when one is behind another controller, when one is literally touching the headset). It is an incredible update that is theoretically coming to the Oculus Quest as well. This update has confirmed my beliefs in the future of inside-out-tracking.The Controllers-The controllers are a minor, but welcome step up from last generation touch controllers. The design change is minimal and the button layout remains essentially the same. I do like how they feel. Unfortunately though I have sometimes accidentally hit my headset as I forget the bar is on top instead of bottom.Displayport-The idiots that give this headset a 1 star review for lack of an HDMI connection apparently can't read. Yes, this headset uses 1 USB 3.0 and 1 Display Port connector, as clearly listed in the item description, with an included display port to mini display port adapter. Any modern GPU will have multiple display ports, and most gaming laptops do too. If you don't have one, try out a displayport to HDMI adapter.Extension Cables-I recently purchased two 10ft cables, one USB 3.0 extender and a display port extender. Unfortunately, the Displayport extender does not work (USB does), I'm guessing because it's too big of a voltage drop. Could be a dud cable, but unlikely. Most people say 6ft works, but that's probably as far as you can extend it. The headset cables are already quite long (10ft I believe), but I was hoping for a larger roomscale setup.Passthrough Plus-Because there are cameras on the Oculus Rift S, you can enable Passthrough, which streams a live black and white view of the world into the headset, on a click of a button or when you step outside guardian boundaries. It's incredibly helpful to reorient yourself, grab a drink, or move something without taking your headset off. I have adored this feature. You can even display mirror your PC while in passthrough.Overall, I've been surprised by the negative reviews. I think the Rift S is one of the best values in PC VR you can get right now. For less than half the price of the upcoming Valve Index, it's hard to go wrong.

My issue is the mess of ecosystem and bad UI design.Yes, terrible UI design for a technology in development. They want to present a solid image well designed product, when it crashes and hungs all over.  As soon as you try more complex games, beta setups it becomes unusable. There is no feedback for anything, no help to solve any issues. It just crashes or blinks 3 dots for ever, so frustrating.As soon as something goes wrong you are locked out to work any issue. There are not error messages or codes or any feedback of what processes are doing. Nothing to help you sort any issue. So it is awesome, until you hit an issue. You will be rebooting your computer many times... This technology is far from that level of stability.  Move all that UX money to make it stable and usable!!!!

I haven't used a VR device in about 5 years, so I was flawed at how good this is. Some of the best games, like Lone Echo, are almost transcendent in allowing the player to truly feel like the character floating through space. Others, like Arizona Sunshine, I had to stop playing because I found the environment too scary, which is difficult to explain if you haven't used the device.The Oculus has finally reached a point of realism where is really works. The hand-held sensors are accurate, the frame-rate is high enough to look like real life and the overall performance of the entire system feels very natural. It also comes with some desktop software that works well in presenting the library of content and giving you a space to try out the VR experience.I've had the occasional crash that's not frequent enough to be annoying, and sometimes the cable length is too short (even though it's about 10 feet), since it's possible to get completely lost in the physical space when using the system. It's comfortable enough to play for hours at a time, though it takes some practice to quickly put on the headset and hand sensors. Despite this, this is a truly immersive system that's astonishing in its performance, and opens a whole new world of gaming that brings the player new methods of interaction.

Way too many issues. This tech was probably on-track to become something great until FB bought it...i7, 16gb ram, RX 580,  -- consistent and constant issues with software. Oculus VR Software is probably the laziest attempt at a platform I've ever seen. When it does work - it works 'OK'.Steam VR isn't much better. The fact that the two don't work well with one another makes this device a colossal waste of money. After a week of trials, tribulations, and frustrations - I've decided to return the Oculus Rift S and try the Valve Index. Maybe it will be better suited for gaming.

I have tried a few VR setups in the past, but the Oculus Rift S is the first VR headset that I have owned personally. I like the fact that it doesn't need any external sensors, as it gives you a lot more flexibility with how you can set it up in a room.The setup is really easy, and it's quick to get up and running. It doesn't really come with much in terms of apps or games, other than some tutorials, so you have to purchase games or apps through the Oculus store or Steam. I picked up Robo Recall so far, and it's a fun game.A couple things I noticed that detract from the experience slightly are the field of view and the audio setup. The field of view seems less than on some other setups. You can see quite a bit of black-space to the sides in your peripheral view, which takes away from the immersive feel. Also, the speakers are in the headband near the ear, and are not an over-ear setup, which from an audio perspective also takes away from the feeling of being really immersed in the environment.Overall for the price, I feel it is a good value, especially if you want to set it up in a room where it might be difficult or cluttered to try and position sensors and sensor-towers. If you are looking for a more immersive experience, than the pricier alternatives might be a better option for you.

I have enjoyed my Vive for over a year with Steam VR. I played a lot of SuperHot, and Arizona Sunrise, and didn’t have any issues with the picture or sound.  Now, having experienced the Rift S, it is hard to go back to my old hardware.The picture is greatly improved and you can notice how much tighter the pixels are. Because I had gotten so used to my previous hardware, I didn't really understand what people meant about “screen door” but I can definitely say the Rift S has a lot less !The headset is comfortable and the sound is acceptable right out of the adjustable head strap.  This allows you to hear the world around you, but makes gaming a little less immersive. It is easy to plug in any set of your favorite headphones with its stereo jack.I am not a super fan of the Oculus launcher because I have gotten so used to to steam. Fortunately this works great with Steam, so if you are used to other hardware, this is truly plug and play.Speaking of plugs, this has a lot less to set up than other headsets. You don't need to install wall trackers, and you plug the headset right into your graphics card. Easy!

First and foremost, make sure you have a graphic card to handle it.  The Rift S has two connectors.  HDMI and USB.  Oculus lists the minimum requirements for your system. I am running a NVIDIA 2080 SUPER and have no problems.When you get your Rift S, you must first download and install the software from Oculus. You will need a Facebook account.  Easy enough to do.The Oculus site has an install wizard that will walk you through, step by step, through the setup process.  Do not plug in the Rift S until prompted to do so.It is very easy to set up.  For the avid gamer, this will change how you play games.  Literally a real game changer.I haven’t tried DCS yet but I do play an online world war 2 combat flight simulator. Flyaceshigh 3.  The Rift S puts me in an entirely new and enhanced virtual world regarding my game.  I am stunned at how good this product is.Bonus:  there is a built in gaming headset.  Mic and speakers.I’m hooked!!!

I've owned DK1, DK2, and CV1. I read all the pre-release reviews prior to purchasing the Rift S and was mostly disappointed when it was revealed that there was just a slight bump in resolution. As such, my expectations were for just an improved Rift. I was wrong. The Rift S has shattered my expectations.The Rift S is AMAZING! First of all, let me mention that the slight bump in resolution does not translate to a slight bump in optics. It's a huge leap in clarity. Totally unexpected. Something else is going on - probably as a result of the new fresnel lenses as well. You can read text almost perfectly. God rays are almost gone. Running the Virtual Desktop is mind blowing, as my desktop is totally usable for reading email and surfing the internet in the Rift. It makes me think at some point that VR will replace a monitor. We're not yet there, but you can see it as inevitable in the Rift S, whereas in the CV1 Rift - no chance.Additionally, the Big Screen Beta app blew me away. You have the impression you're at an IMAX theater while in the Rift S. Not only is the sense of scale real (as it was in CV1), but the movie playing on the virtual big screen is actually good enough to watch. Almost with the quality it would have in the theater. Not quite, but damn close. Obviously that was not the case in CV1 for those kinds of apps.The tracking is also incredible. Getting rid of the sensors makes things so much easier. Easy to hook up. No mess of cables. No loss of tracking when turning around. It was pretty plug plug and play. The Rift S also opens and closes the app/games easily. There's much less of having to restart things or mess with the 3rd party Oculus Tray app.The Rift S passthough is another glimpse into the future. It works really well to show you your surroundings in black/white and makes it super easy to draw room boundaries. You get a real sense of how AR might work down the road. The integration of tools for just the boundaries is so perfect that I wonder what will happen when that side gets developed for more than just this purpose.People do complain about the audio. Personally, I have no issues with it. I really like not wearing headphones or earbuds and not having anything touch my ears. It increases the immersion as the expense of audio fidelity, but I'm ok with that. It's pretty cool not feeling your ears covered. It feels like you are in the VR space when the sound is around your head as opposed to in your ears.Overall, I feel like the Rift S is the Rift that should have been. I feel like CV1 was more like DK3. This is the first step in VR, not step 1.5. This is the way it should be. Don't think of this as a replacement for the Rift. Don't compare specs to CV1. Think of this as the first commercial Rift and be amazed - just like me.

It’s sad to see all these low ratings because people can’t read either other reviews or the product description to see that your PC needs a Display Port connection.... Do people really spend $400 without actually knowing anything about the product??This thing is awesome, bottom line. There’s not much I can say that hasn’t been said already, I just wanted to add my rating and let people know a lot of these low rated reviews have nothing to do with the product and everything to do with people just not bothering to actually know what they were buying.

I was sent a free Oculus Rift S from Oculus themselves. First time I ever experienced virtual reality. Is this the future in gaming yes. I would of never bought one or thought about buying one if they didn't send me one. Definitely going to tell all my friends to grab a VR set now and looking forward to future innovations. VR needs more companies to come out with AAA title exclusive. For now it's mostly limited to old games that are patched for a VR like experience and android type of graphic games. It gets real sweaty so it must be cleaned regularly. Last but not least I did try X rated VR. The stripper in front of me looked like a real person at a real club. I gave it 4/5 stars because it doesn't feel as comftorable around my head and when it is in a comfortable spot it get's blurry. There should be someway to move the lense a little in the future.

> Super simple setup - and able to define the Guardian System area with much greater precision> Only 1 USB required and, come on folks, if you have the PC rig to run this thing (tho I will admit laptop gaming rigs may not) including the necessary high-end graphics card, you SHOULD have a DisplayPort - if not?  It's time to upgrade the graphics card - adding memory, increasing performance?  ....again, a ""no-brainer"" to get the most out of VR> Significantly improved graphics re brightness and clarity - even with the 80hz refresh rate> I was a 71mm IPD with the Rift (the highest setting) - the setting the Rift S came with worked great - and super easy to adjust headset for perfect distance of eyes to lenses - even with glasses (plus there is that ability to adjust IPD with the software)> MUCH more comfortable than the Rift - again ESPECIALLY if you are wearing glasses> MUCH easier to take off - again, especially if you have glasses - they don't get pulled off your face as happened often with the Rift> Sound?  Never was an issue with the Rift as I played games using voice control, so I needed a good headset with a microphone, plus I like the total immersion of phones with complete ear-covering (original Rift never had this).  These same earphones easily fit over the Rift S - the only thing I discovered was that you had to make sure the Rift S cable was out of the way when putting on the phones.> Sweat?  If you purchased one of those cloth covers for the rift, cut the two elastic straps, tie top one around the top support, cut the other one off, cut off the part that used to fit around the nose, and, voila, easy to make it workAbsolutely, 100% worth upgrading.

This is my first ""true"" VR system so I do not have a reference point.  My previous experience was the Samsung Gear VR and I was rather disappointed with it.First of all, installation / set up was straightforward with my AW-17 gaming laptop.  I am pleased that the external sensors are no longer required.  However, you are still tethered to the computer via the display port cord.The graphics is truly amazing!  I am astounded by the quality of the graphics as well as the immersive VR experience.  The audio quality is decent but could be improved upon.Things to consider when purchasing this VR system:1. The LCD display has a refresh rate of 80 Hz.  In terms of graphics quality, higher frame rate and AMOLED display provide a more immersive environment and gaming experience.2. This headset has a fixed interpupillary distance of 64 mm, which can be tweaked via software set up.  However, it is not sub-optimal if your IPD is a lot different, as it may induce eyestrain.3. I love it that this system is almost wireless but if you desire a truly wireless system, the Quest would fulfill it.  However, there are pros/cons to that system as well.

It is hard to understand what Oculus was thinking when they decided to eliminate the physical IPD adjustment on the Rift S.  As someone with a non-average IPD (mine is 71.5) I am simply not able to use the Rift S.  Based on studies the Rift S is only ideal for around 50% of people whose IPD falls within a millimeter or two of the fixed lenses.  Add to that the fact that they also went from dual OLED screens on the Rift CV1 to a single inferior LCD screen on the Rift S and you simply have a product that makes no sense.  As a huge Oculus supporter and a day-one purchaser of the CV1 I am highly disappointed.

Simple setup, great design, comfortable, and immersive. I got my Rift S on release day as my first taste of gaming VR with all intentions of returning it after I'd had my fun. However, within a couple of days, I realized that this was something I needed from now on for gaming. What an experience.From VR chat to Beat Saber to ping pong, this thing sucks you into works making you forget everything else around you in a physically engaging game experience. Thanks to Beat Saber alone, I lost 5-6 pounds in the first week just by having fun and not wanting to stop.Games seem tuned perfectly to work with the touch controllers, which feel natural and are responsive. The downside is that if you reach too far to the sides or behind you, the on-headset cameras lose track of them. There's also an issue where putting the headset on sometimes does not activate the lenses and causes my primary monitor to turn on and off repeatedly until I close the software and restart my computer, but that is rare.Overall, definitely a great piece of hardware for anyone considering getting into VR.

This headset has some serious issues with tracking. Ostensibly it uses the same system as the Quest 1 and Quest 2 for tracking, but having had the opportunity to use all three at this point, the implementation on this headset is significantly worse.If you only play casually, such as a little bit of Beat Saber (5 notes per second or less), this will likely get the job done, in which case you might be fine. But if you're anything like me and most people I've had a chance to talk to, you'll slowly be improving your speed at the game and you /will/ hit a point where the tracking just cannot keep up. I get frustrated on a daily basis now because I want to use Beat Saber for my daily cardio, but I've gotten to the point where most songs I play for exercise are just too fast for the controllers. Almost every song I have at least one section where either controller will randomly place itself away from my body, and won't recover anywhere near fast enough to prevent missing several notes, often losing the song or at least throwing me badly off-rhythm. Especially on diagonal hits, where the controllers are likely to not be in your immediate field-of-view if you do wider swings, it seems this headset really struggles to keep up, even though the side cameras should easily still have them in view.It's possibly my headset is faulty, but this is my second Rift S. Both had this issue (although the first one was ultimately returned due to a faulty cable, which was also not a good sign imo). I don't experience the same issue when using a Quest or Quest II, even when playing the exact same songs.If you absolutely must have a headset around this price, and you want to use it for something like Beat Saber at high speed, I highly recommend going with an original Quest, and not the Quest II if you can. The Quest II will work, but the controllers are bigger and heavier. Both are better than this headset though. If you can save for a better headset, though, then I highly recommend getting something with external tracking that won't have issues when you swing to your sides or behind. I know that's what I am doing and I can't wait to no longer have to use this headset.

Read online, most people have these problems: it doesn't like particular USB ports on your PC, the headset will randomly stop being detected and will require a restart, when playing flight simulators (SW Squadrons/Elite Dangerous) flight sticks will randomly stop being detected, Guardian (set up your play area) will require you to set it up again during gameplay, interrupting whatever you were doing, after playing something particularly demanding, the sound will become extremely distorted, extension cables will not work/cause it not to be detected.There are also numerous fixes to try: get a Inateck PCI-e to USB 3.0 card, get a powered USB hub, install Oculus Tray Tool. None of these fixes work.I think part of the problem is that oculus wants you to launch with their own ""hub"" which is seems very poorly optimized on top of launching steam's ""hub"", both of which run in the background of whatever game your playing.""But wait Mr. Reviewer, why don't you launch games just with Oculus? You can do that you know!""I did and every problem still occurred.Another problem I may be having is that the RTX 3080 is very new and the oculus isn't optimized for such new hardware. Well, I waited over two months for them to update and I still receive the ""Your computer doesn't meet Rift's recommended specifications"" regardless of the fact that I'm running the newest possible hardware.Save yourself the money and get a different headset, don't settle for the cheapest option as that option is often the worst one.

I really, really wanted to love the Rift S.  Oculus makes that impossible. First, I ran the steam VR check to see if I could run it, all good. Buy the Rift S, and it doesn't work. Turns out that you don't need USB 3.0 ports as they claim, you need SPECIFIC GENERATIONS of USB 3.0 ports. (Oculus used to have a published tool that would have told me this, but they removed it from their site because it would have let consumers know that most of their USB 3.0 ports wouldn't work) So I went on their website, and bought an expansion card that they recommended. Nope, still didn't work, the card they recommended on their website does not supply enough power. Naturally, I dropped several hundred more dollars on a PC upgrade, finally get it running, and realize that it shipped with large sections in the middle of the lenses that are marred, so when looking directly ahead the image isn't clear. A few frustrating HOURS of playing (still on the first day of use) the batteries need changed. It says they take AA, so I buy some, and change them out. These work for two or three hours, then stop working. Checked the forums, and the controllers require SPECIFIC TYPES OF AA. Bottom line, this is absolutely a beta test level of tech. If you are committed to restarting the client every session to make it work, frequently reinstalling the Oculus Client, only buying company approved AAs (which they will not tell you about prior) then go ahead and get this. They did a lot of good ground work in developing this, but it simply isn't a plug and play system like.... every other console or gaming device.

I had the Oculus Rift and loved it! I decided that my only real complaint with the Rift was the setup and having to use sensors so i upgraded to the Rift S. That was a huge mistake, its extremely buggy and has been over a month since i purchased the product and i have had ticket open since day 1. The support team has simply told me they will need to wait for more patches and offered me store credit, well since i can't use the device the store credit is useless. I would go to another provider HTC or Steam since this device was clearly rushed and Oculus is not supporting it.My PC is way past the minimum specs and can run the original Oculus perfectly fine without it crashing or freezing every 10 minutes. I really regret this upgrade, and unforutenetly cannot return it. Huge mistake, and shame on Oculus for releasing such a terrible product. Its also not just me, if you search for issues with the Rift S there are many people who cannot use this device without it crashing or freezing constantly.

Very displeased with support service. So for more than a few times, my headset loses its ability to move within the game, the view just locks up midgame. And then sometimes the hands stop tracking, it gets stuck in a spot. Customer service will need to you hand over your data and basically make you disable random software like your antivirus software. Seriously?? You want me to get rid of everything you guys didn't make compatible with??? But of course, none of that worked. All this plugging and unplugging and disabling and enabling was totally not going to solve anything. But they won't replace your unit or provide real support. They're just canned procedures and they don't even really cater to your specific problem. I had the rift, then the rift s. No longetivity and really no replay value. Not worth the money especially if it gives you problems and customer support is really only there to help the company not have to send replacements instead of really being concerned about your experience.

Cant compare it to any other VR system out there, I honestly didnt want this, The kids did. Figured it would end up in the pile of things they also wanted from years gone by they didnt use. I have to say after using it, It is very cool. And it does get used quite frequently. I think its amazing, The speakers could be better because they dont come down over your ears they just project music down to your ears but so far no issues. I knocked it down a start because we have some some issues with it. For one, we had to reinstall it after about a month? something happened and it would not sense when you put the headset on and the picture was just red? I uninstalled, reinstalled and it came right back to life. That may have been due to an update or just plain freaked out? Other than that no issues and very cool item.

Bottom line: the hardware is great. The software is atrocious and invasive! I've had the headset for over a year and really tried to ignore the terrible spyware and Facebook requirement. My hope was that someone would eventually offer a 3rd party software like SteamVR or Viveport but instead I find that many programs now require SteamVR in ADDITION to the proprietary base software! In other words, it's getting worse rather than better. I gave up and tossed this headset in the closet. Strongly recommend you avoid any headset until they agree not to violate your privacy as a condition of use!

Garbage. Not that it doesn't, from time to time, produce some stunning effects. That said just mostly WTF setup. What works with it, what doesn't?  Never ending issues with how you ""Draw the Line"" for it's floor.  You set it up, then the setup just disappears.  It's, at best a novelty.  Flighty controls.  Disorientating  navigation.  I'm not sure this is unique to this model or brand but VR is not even close to being a ""daily Driver"" for the lack of a better term.

They need your prayers.This has been the most time consuming, most expensive, and most frustrating gift I have EVER had to bear witness to. If you want to enjoy this product, I suggest starting months in advance and set aside a small fortune to get started.My partner received this gift from his family and we were both excited to get home and try this out for the first time. He loves PC gaming and so we knew that his relatively new custom built gaming PC would be just the powerhouse we needed to get the full experience. We were immediately wrong.We got home and found that the Oculus, rather than using the wide standard of HDMI, opted for the DisplayPort connecter. Well, the brand new graphics card in his PC computer doesn't have a DisplayPort connecter. Immediately realizing this wasn't going to work we decided to use the included mini-display adapter since we had the right port on my Mac. Lo and behold, there is NO Mac support. At all. You can't even connect it with BootCamp or VMWare Fusion by running Windows on your Mac. Nope. For that you have to buy an external display card as a work-around.So here we are with no where to plug this thing in and I decide the next day I'll just run out and get another graphics card. The first affordable one didn't have a DisplayPort. And neither did the top of the line card I looked at. In fact, out of the many cards I looked at at the store, only one had a DisplayPort. And it was $400. So here we are nearly a grand in and I have yet to turn it on.I can't blame Oculus for this, but I got home with my new graphics card and I went to go install it in his computer. Guess who's got two thumbs and 6-pin power cables in their computer with a card that takes an 8-pin cable. This guy. Talk about adding insult to injury. Now I'm waiting for an adapter to arrive because no one carries one locally.So It's been three days, everyone is closed for Christmas, and I have $800 worth of junk sitting in my living room and I have yet to see what this thing even does. It might be the most regrettable gift ever.If you have the fantasy of waking up Christmas morning, having the kids open up their fresh-out-of-the-box Oculus Rift S, and having a plug-and-play experience around the Christmas tree, think again. For us, it'll be at least a week before we can even turn it on.

I'm going to be generous with a 4 star rating as this VR set up is pretty cool, but suffers with some niggles.Ocuclus is now owned by Facebook (who knew) but that hasn't changed the hardware.First and MOST important, you must have a decent PC or laptop, preferably running with a gaming graphics card, a lot or RAM and good capabilities.Second, you also need one with a display port cable output, as this unit does NOT support HDMI.Once you get it up and running it's pretty straightforward.If you look online you can find a ton of free stuff to try out the gear before you start spending.The unit has headphone inputs and the rest is mostly self contained.This is a world away from the $19.99 VR headsets that you stick your phone in, it's very clever.That said, it's still early days I think, considering the $400 you may want to consider whether this is a nice to have, or a need to have.

I did some reading around and a KEY bit of information they haven't disclosed is that IPD or inter pupil distance adjustment is fixed for the lenses so if you are at the outer ranges wearing this will be like wearing the wrong glasses prescription.  The original Rift, and even cheap binoculars all adjust for eye distance, but Occulus decided to save a couple $ in plastic levers to move the lenses and hard mount everything.That means I will not be buying this as my IPD is on the outer fringe 71 out of a max of 72mm.  I'm not going to pay this money to feel intese eye strain the entire time I'm playing.

A few weeks after seeing that Half Life Alyx was underway at Valve software, and a VR exclusive, I knew I'd be forced into getting a VR headset. Having not experienced anything in VR before using the Rift, I felt pretty comfortable foregoing the HTC and Valve Index and instead going for the cheaper, less demanding option.Well fast-forward a few months, and after putting quite a bit of time into the VR platform I feeling pretty confident in making a recommendation in VR and the possibilities of entertainment it opens up. The inside out tracking works great, I do not notice any screen door effect, and as long as you've got the space to enjoy it and move around within the VR experience, it almost feels like a no brainer to say its worth the money, despite the little annoyances such as quickly draining controller batteries and having to remember that the cord from the headset to your PC will always be on the floor ready to trip you if you're not careful. If these little things seem like they're bearable inconveniences that you can put up with, I'd highly recommend the Rift S if you're looking to jump into VR.

I have now owned two of these and both have had a ton of issues. The first one I used for a few hours and then just completely died on me, neither of my computers could detect either the DP or USB. I spent 3 hours trying literally everything, I can guarantee you this is not user error and it was broken. I then got a second one because overall I liked the product when it was working. This one also worked for a couple hours just fine (besides sub-par tracking). The next day I tried to set it up and it detected the headset but said that the sensors couldn't track the headset. Umm, the trackers ARE the headset??? I again tried a ton of things to fix this and nothing is working. Oculus released a product that was not ready to be released and completely screwed their customers. This isn't just me, hundreds of people are also having these same issues. The subreddit r/oculus is being flooded with posts about peoples Rifts being broken. Don't buy this, at least not for a while until they hopefully get all of this fixed.

I like that it's been upgraded and improved since we don't need to be bogged down by those ugly external sensors. What I don't like is reading reviews from people who get so jaded that they tell other people ""dont waste your money!!!!!!"" Because they got a bad oculus. You're going to get a bad device or item every once in a while and that's a reality. The fantasy is thinking everything you buy will be just perfect...... don't set yourself up for disappointment. My dad always told us, ""hope for the best, expect the worst"". Live by those words and you'll never be disappointed or surprised 👍Also, don't let disappointments or failure(s) take the wind out of your sails. It's not how many times you get knocked down that counts, it's how many times you keep getting back up. Hope this helps some of you. Peace

I bought a Rift S pretty much as soon as it released, which is my own fault, but I've had it for a few months now. I've had far too many issues and it's been an incredibly frustrating experience. My PC passed Oculus's readiness test with flying colors, yet sometimes it works, but most of the time is does not.  I've spent far more time than I should have trying to resolve issues. When it works, it's great. However, having to disconnect and reconnect it every single time I use it is just bad.  That being said, I have a Quest and it's far superior, at least in terms of ease of use.  I'd still like a PC headset, but I may be ditching the Rift S for one less plagued by bugs.  I've found that I often need to reseat the video cable where it connects to the headset, which I shouldn't have to do, especially not so frequently.

I ordered mine off of Oculus's website, however I am assuming the same basic experience will be present from Amazon. It took longer than expected to arrive due to bad weather, but what can you do.Unboxing experience:The box felt premium in quality, it has a handle at the top implying it is designed to be carried around, maybe even travelled with. Inside is the Headset, controllers, included controller batteries, and a few adapters.First day of usage:This is the second VR headset I have used in my life for longer than an hour or two, once before I had the chance of playing on my relative's PlayStation VR, and so here is the comparative experience: after an hour or two of usage, I began to feel sweaty, which caused the lenses to fog a little bit, and also I got a big red mark on my forehead that hurt for a minute afterward. The sweatiness problem can be fixed if you have an AC, just be sure to set it colder than you would normally otherwise you will sweat, and it will not smell nice. The red mark I am guessing could be fixed by adjusting the headset, I just was too absorbed in my Beat Saber game to do anything about it. At any rate, it is noticeably more comfortable, and just overall better designed than the PlayStation VR that I used before. The headband feels premium quality as well, not cheap. Setting it up and getting it to work in SteamVR (which I highly recommend over the Oculus store) can be a little bit of a hassle, but once it is set up properly, opening Steam games is very straight-forward. I have one small complaint though, in games like Beat Saber, I have found it quite easy to accidentally hit the menu button, which is extremely irritating. You simply have to figure out a way to keep your thumb off of the menu button.Overall great experience, I would recommend this to anyone wanting a premium VR experience for under $500

I've owned the original Oculus Rift as well as another VR set by Lenovo. I really liked the improvements that they made with this version. They definitely upgraded the quality and look of the display, which is much clearer and crisp than previously. The headset itself is both lightweight and comfortable to wear for an extended duration. It's not too bulky that it feels like it's weighing your head down the whole time. The controllers are fairly similar in that they're both comfortable to hold and easy to utilize. The insight tracking works well and frees you up to move easily about without having to worry about sensors. This obviously inside the top of the line VR headset out there, but it's the best bang for your buck based on the quality of the product and what you get for this price point.

Every single time I try to use the device, I need to go through the setup process because it does not detect the inputs.

This is a really nice headset. Runs smooth amd looks good. Also you can con ect to steam vr and play more games as well, i babied the thing, However, the recently i had broken my left touch control 3 months in, It was on a seam of the plastic ring, it still worked, but a little bit worried its degrade over time... no big deal, I contacted oculus on oct. 6th 2020. And exchanged roughly 30 email. Then... nothing. I opened a new ticket, to coninue the first one as i got no response. After discussing that i had a ticket. They asked me for the same information again. 15 emails later, same thing... nothing for a bout a week, i asked multiple times for an update on The status of my support ticket. To no avail. Its Oct. 30th as of writing this, and they just asked me again for the same parts information as well as my address, etc... for the 3rd time... i really do not feel as if i should go another round of this. Im getting no closer to them even considering taking a look into this further, or give me options to on who to pay to recieve help or who to pay to fix... at this point ill most likely purchase a replacement, and sell my headsetset on ebay, or give it away to a family member. while i could have done that before and not sold it. It was kinda a last resort that i was hoping i didnt have to shell out another $140 dollars for 1 controller. So im probably just going to look to another headset manufacturer

I had my original oculus Rift for over 2 years now it was great as my first experience in VR, it worked well enough in the dark to play and had no issues adding friends to Oculus.  Now with the push to force Oculus users to link their accounts with FB is unacceptable.  When you have kids playing games they dont need FB accounts. I can see if they want people to link their accounts as an option and only for some of the experiences but not all or nothing!  The Rift-S is ok otherwise not great, the new controllers get annoying with the loop on top when you play some games.  One good thing is you can still play some games and experiences with  accounts created specifically for those.  And you can always use steam.

I had bought the rift S about a month ago, and overall it is very fun to play. The reaction time for the cameras is really good, and it has smooth graphics, (with a fairly good computer.) the only problem with the rift, however, is how finicky the setup is whenever you want to play. Sometimes its the DisplayPort cable, and sometimes it's the usb3 cable. Sometimes the sensors cant track the headset, and each time you have to so through a few updates or fixes to fix it. All in all, however, it is a very good headset, and many of the times the setup works fine, so don't let that dismay you for getting the headset.

I received my Oculus Rift S in the mail a few days ago as a gift, and since then, I've only been able to get it to work once.  After many failed installation attempts I was finally able to get it working, but once I restarted the computer, the problem was back and I've never been able to get it working again.  I've received all kinds of errors: ""Sensors can't track headset,"" ""Oculus software restart required,"" ""No DisplayPort Connection,"" three loading dots on the screen (on the rare occasions that the screen actually turns on), among others.  I've tried everything: uninstalling and reinstalling the software, repairing the software, using their beta software updates, switching USB 3.0 ports, switching DisplayPorts, restarting... Nothing works.  I have a VR-ready computer and I should not be having these many issues.  I filed a support ticket and they told me that they were aware of the issue and that they would let me know as soon as there was an update.I'll update the review should they ever release an update to fix their faulty software, but until then, I would advise everybody to buy their new VR headset from another company.  I looked forward to having one of these for years and as it stands, I have an expensive paperweight and a whole lot of disappointment.

i have the Samsung HMD Odyssey+ and this is my first oculus VR headset.  i will say the resolution on the rift S is better than the samsung and less glare as well.  seems odd since technically it shouldn't be better but watching videos and playing games its quicker and the resolution definitely looks better.  being i dont know the original rift's ins and outs it took me a little bit to understand how to navigate but all VR's i have tried have their issues and quirkiness.  I had to reinstall Oculus on my laptop but then most things seemed to work fine.  had some issues with disconnect and reconnecting and the controllers werent working right, but that could very well be windows.

It was working fine until the 1.37 update - and still works VERY occasionally. Maybe less than 1% of the time.I've tried troubleshooting EVERYTHING. Different USB ports, uninstalling/reinstalling, completely reinstalling Windows, the Virtual Link USB C port on my RTX 2080, completely removing ALL OCULUS RELATED files and folders and reinstalling, installing to a different drive, etc etc etc. It works for a while sometimes when I restart my computer but always ends up with the orange LED not working.

fun when it works.  The headset has connection issues.

And again and again and again.  your VR experience is a series of connection issues.furthermore, vr looks prettier and has some better tracking, but hasn't improved much since I bought HTC VIVE a few years ago.  it's still point and click.

Got this as a Christmas present in 2019. It is currently June 2, 2021. It completely stopped working for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Tried to get it to work today and it kept saying no USB connection or DisplayPort connection. You might be thinking, why not just buy another cord for the headset? Great question, I shouldn't have to. A $400 product should not only last a year and a half of use(and for the record, I only used it a few times a month) because there exists such a thing as an implied warranty. But Oculus doesn't care about the existence of implied warranties because they don't care about you.

Great product. I find it a lot better than the original Oculus. The tracking and display are both a great improvement. Unless you have a GIANT head, the ipd shouldn’t bother you. It’s ideal for people 61-65mm. You can check this if easily with an iPhone using the EyeMeasure app. Also, it does only use display port so a laptop won’t work, however; if you’re gaming on a laptop you shouldn’t get a VR headset and you’re smooth brained if you do. Additionally, this is included if you just read the description. All the negative reviews are from people who apparently have huge heads and can’t read. Great product and I would recommend it.

I didn't buy my rift s on this Amazon account though I did buy it from Amazon. Overall it has been a mixed bag, the controllers have issues with tracking and will sometimes get stuck. The right controller uses a lot of battery for some reason and I don't know why. also when I first bought it I thought it was broken because it was just a black screen, then after some messing it was static, then it broke and put my avatar under the floor. I got it working later on but I have had to do way too much troubleshooting for a 400$ PRODUCT!! I would not recommend this headset at the moment, it's not ready. it does have some pros like you don't need the external sensors, but it's still not worth it to me.

I've had this for a month now and only have a few games, but I'm already consumed by it. The Oculus Rift S is possibly the greatest piece of technology I've ever used.Pros:-Easy to setup; the software is very simple and fun to use-Tracking is incredibly smooth, especially for having no external sensors/cameras-Comfortable headset, although some adjustments are somewhat limited-Very well built; I accidentally dropped mine from about a height of 6 feet and it survived without a scratch-Lenses are clear and easy to keep clean, all you need is a microfiber cloth-Includes ""Guardian"" feature; allows you to create a safe zone to keep yourself from hitting thingsCons:-The cable. No external sensors means you're constantly tethered from the headset to the PC with a big cable. As long as it doesn't stretch too far or snag on anything, you should be good.-The ""Home"" button on the right controller is somewhat awkwardly placed and I find myself accidentally pressing it during some games, but not too much of a problem-Adjusting the setting for IPD (interpupillary distance) doesn't seem to do anything if the picture is blurryOverall, the Oculus Rift S is a great choice for anyone who wants to get into VR but might not have the room space/budget for the external sensors. Highly recommended.

First let me say that I am an experienced VR user.  I have (still) the DK1 dev kit that Oculus first started with.  I also have the CV1 (or consumer version RIFT).  They are both amazing.The GO was good, but left me wanting a bit more.  The QUEST has what I wanted...A great looking screen, 6DOF (that is movement in 3D space), and many titles to choose from on DAY 1!.And it will only get better.  Those mentioning that it is using a cell phone processor are correct.  What they fail to mention is the way the software developers (and hardware guys as well) optimize the software in such a way that you will never realize this is a portable unit.UPDATE:  JUST FOUND OUT that you can now STREAM STEAM VR GAMES to your QUEST!!!!  Talk about a game changer!

I am currently running the headset using the Asus ROG Zephyrus Laptop that has a GTX 1080 Max-Q GPU and it runs flawlessly. I purchased a TYPE-C USB 3.1 to DP 4K HD Video Adapter Convert USB-C to Display Port Adapter off Ebay for under $5.00 and the computer immediately recognized the headset allowing me to successfully do the firmware update as well as the initial setup for immediate play.Setting up the vr headset was much easier than the previous iteration and the sensors on the headset respond very well to the controllers.I currently own the CV1 and highly recommend this unit over the CV1 due to its improvement in image quality and that fact that you don't have to set up other base sensors. Doing away with the external base sensors makes the rift s ideal for simulators.

This headset is ""meh."" The audio has big problems, the ""inside out"" tracking is less reliable than the tracking in the previous version of the Rift (and certainly not as reliable as SteamVR tracking), and the display (namely, field of view and refresh rate) is inferior to that of other PC VR headsets. Also, there is no wireless option. If your goal is to save money, then Windows Mixed Reality headsets are a better price performer, especially when there is a sale. And if performance and experience are priorities, then the Vive Pro, Pimax, and upcoming Valve Index are better options.

so, like many of you, i have scoured the interwebs reading as many rift s reviews and comparisons as possible. i've also watched many of the ""through the lens"" type videos that compares the video rez and SDE of the rift s to other headsets.in addition to the rift s, i also own a rift cv1 and an oculus go.first off i will say that the the rift s lens' and resolution feels the same as the oculus go, so if you have a cv1 and a go like i did, then you already know what the resolution bump is going to look like.my goal here was to:-increase comfort, resolution,-reduce eyestrain, god rays, screen door effect-have a better gaming experience.i run everything on a decent gaming machine with a 980ti video card.  can run just about any vr title i've ever tried on the rift cv1.so first off, comfort. i was hoping the new halo headband would be better then the cv1 headstrap. for me this was not the case. for my medium sized head, i'm going to call the halo headband a major fail in comfort. In order to get the rift in the ""sweet spot"" where things are the most clear (especially text) and i have the best possible peripheral vision, i have to ratchet the rear head strap tightening knob to the point where i feel like my head is being compressed. i instantly have issues with too much pressure in my sinuses and i get a headache from it. in addition to essentially squeezing the band tighter on your head, you can also move the goggles closer to your eyes and you can adjust a headstrap that goes down the center top part of your head.  having tried every tighter / looser combination with all possible adjustments i've found there is no way to comfortably keep this headset on my head if i want the screens placed optimally over my eyes. the main problem i think is that the goggles don't angle up / down like the rift cv1, just forward and back. hard to describe, but it's unusable for me.  to make my cv1 comfortable i placed a small counterweight on the back of headstrap and replaced the goggle foam. i tried this with the rift s but it didn't fix my main issue which is the feeling my head is being kinda squished if i want it tight enough to not move around. fyi my IPD is 61 to 62, so this headset should be perfect for me in that regard.next up i'll compare cv1 to rift s resolution. without a doubt, you can see there is more clarity and a higher screen pixel count. the screen door effect is less pronounced on the rift s, as well.  these are all what i was looking for yet none of it really mattered. i say that because along with these positives comes the fact that the color's are less deep and vibrant and the darkers are less dark,  the godray and screen door effect difference wasn't very noticeable (not when i was playing a game...in fact i didn't notice a difference when playing games, only when i paused a game while looking intently to compare).  the rift s non-adjustable ipd thing was also weird for me. i used it and it seemed to contribute to the headache.as soon as i put my cv1 back on my head it's like a breath of fresh air. my head is no longer being squished, the sound is fantastic, my ipd headache goes away, and the colors and quality of the amoled screen feels much better even though the resolution is lower.the rift s feels heavier and more cheaply made.i would have to say that there is not a single improvement that made the upgrade worth it, or even made it feel like an upgrade.final verdict is the rift cv1 is way way way more comfortable, has much better sound, looks just as good if you increase your ss (super sampling) to 1.5 or 2.0, doesn't give me headaches, and has the manaul ipd adjustment thing. i noticed that the rift-s does not handle super sampling well on my pc. I can get away with 1.5 regularly and sometimes 2.0 with the rift cv1 but it's shaky even at 1.3 on the rift s. not a big deal since the rift s with no SS looks as good as the cv1 with 1.5 to 2.0 ss, but i was hoping i could really boost the visuals on the rift s with ss.almost forgot...the rift s keeps losing it's headset connection. this means i have to close steam, steam vr, and the oculus software, then unplug and replug my headset, then reboot the programs, then sometimes it works and other times i just get audio so i have to reboot my pc and then i'm usually good for awhile. this happens often and most times it happens i have to redo my guardian boundary, so that's me drawing that boundary at least once per session. lame!having said all that, i liked a few things:the controllers are ok. they are cheaper feeling and the quality control is not on par with the cv1 touch controls, but they aren't bad. i kind of like them better in function even though the seem poorly made in comparison.the tracking is great. i had zero issues with tracking playing FPS games and sim games. i love the cameras and how you can see your environment without removing the headset. and i love the 2 connections vs the 5 connections my rift cv1 requires (i use 3 sensors on my cv1).so, after reading other people say all this stuff, i decided i'd try anyway, and i'm glad i did, only because now i can return the rift s and no longer consider it an option.one thing i noticed was regardless of the low FPS,  i sometimes still have more fun with my oculus go because i'm not tethered to any thing.  that cable on both rift units really gets in the way for exercise or fps games.  i have a fancy way to hang my cable from the ceiling, and it's still a PIA.  this has got me thinking that the quest is the way to go for me, if i can ever find one for sale again. the moled display, the ipd adjustment, the wireless nature, the ability to use a pc with a link cable or wirelessly through the quest version of virtual desktop... all sounds good. my only hesitancy is the 72 hz refresh rate on the quest. seriously? i don't know if i can handle that. the rift s was making me a bit seasick at 80 hz and i've been playing vr games like it's my job for a few years now (so i have my ""vr legs"" already and i rarely get sea sick).seems like there's not really a great affordable upgrade right now at the $400 price point, although the reverb g2 at 600 looks like the best bet as it's the closest thing anyone has made to a rift cv2 so far. but then guys like me would have to upgrade my video card and times are tight here in the pandemic so, hmmmmm?  EDIT: i found a samsung odyessy plus on ebay for $200 so that's on it's way now. looks like it's basically the rift cv2 i was looking for with the higher resolution, the built in good audio, the amoled screens, the reduced sde, the manual ipd adjusment, and great after market comfort upgrades to make the halo headset approach comfortable. will update this post if that solution does indeed feel like i finally found my 'rift cv2'.TL:DRif you own the rift cv1, just don't buy the rift s as an upgrade. i was warned by a number of online reviews, and i ignored them.  bad for me, good for you?

Switch your monitor over to an HDMI cable connection, instead of a display port connection. Rift S will still be connected to your GPU Display Port. It seems that Rift S does NOT like to share Display Port connections along with a Display Port Monitor when Both are connected to the GPU Display Ports. Gone is the error saying "" Display Port Not Connected.""  I don't have to wonder anymore why the internet retail place I purchased my Oculus S from Included a Free HDMI cable. Even though the Oculus Rift S had a Display Port Connection, not an HDMI one. Problem solved. Both Display Port and USB 3 indicators stay ""green"" in the Oculus Rift S setup now.

Great product! Unfortunately Oculus has been bought out by Facebook and there have been talks about adding adds to the gaming experience. Also, the Rift series has been discontinued, it will still be supported for years to come BUT their main focus is now on the Oculus Quest. I will definitely be selling mine, don't need Facebook harvesting my consumer data through Virtual Reality. Good luck to those that chose to fall victim to Facebook.

Then I realized, FB had locked it.They disabled my account because I broke their TOS foe being to young.

This works fantastic, as advertised, great resolution bump plus no base stations needed. Can't believe a guy gave it 1-star because *he* didn't see it only works in Windows 10 first. How does his failure to read mean this product is only worth one star? Endless fun with your Oculus library, either as an upgrade to the older set or as your first VR experience.

As the owner of the first release Oculus Rift & HTC Vive back in 2016 as well as the owner of Samsung Odyssey Plus. I find this product somehow disappointing after 3 years of waiting.PROS:  Improved headband. It is a lot easier to put on this headset, even for people who wear glasses. For me, this is a huge plus. it is better than all other VR headsets I have tried.  No beacon tracking feels great: less cables on my desk, but it comes at a cost I will discuss later.The Mediocre:  The screen resolution is an improvement over the original rift, but the resolution is actually lower than most other recent VR sets. (Vive Pro, Odyssey Plus, and Quest). You will find that the overall image sharpness is actually better in the Odyssey Plus and even the Quest, though the Rift S has a slight edge in text sharpness due to its RGB array.  The screen quality is also worse than OLED headsets. The blacks looks grayish and the contrast is a lot worse. The color looks a bit pale compare to the Quest Screen. Some people may prefer a flatter screen color, but I prefer more ""pop"" in the colors because I do not do professional work in VR.  The viewing comfort also is not the best. My IPD is 68mm, I felt slight discomfort when using it for watching videos and reading texts. Refresh rate also decreased to 80 HZ in case you did not realize it.  The speaker is also a downgrade, at least for me. The speaker on the headset allows all ambient sounds, which means you will hear the birds chirping, cars going by, computer fan noise, etc. while you are using the VR. I find it way to distracting. The sound quality itself is only decent, only comparable to a laptop speaker. I liked the headphones on my original rift and Odyssey plus much more.  The tracking works just as well as the original rift if not better. The caveat is that it requires bright ambient light. In low light situation, you would lose tracking frequently, and the warning will turn the whole screen black with the warning message in the middle.My take: first I have to thank Oculus for bringing the price down, but some of us are expecting something better even if it costs more. I really hope that Oculus can come up with a pro-version to broaden the product line, just like the iPhone XR and iPhone XS.Other Thoughts: the Quest is the best in its class, I recommend you guys to try and buy one, but my Rift S is gonna go back to my local retailer.

Decent headset, predatory company. I had been using this for the last year and a half, or so, without any major problems. However, the latest TOS requires Facebook and includes a release of your likeness to use for advertising purposes. Don't buy unless you want to let them exploit you. Don't buy if you value privacy, at all. Don't allow this to become precedent, it's borderline criminal and there was no warning to customers who purchased before the update nor do they offer an option to opt out of any part.In sum: If you buy this, you will be exploited by Facebook.

I bought an Oculus Rift S back in Dec. 2019. I haven't gotten more than 10 playing hours on it because I spend most of my time trying to get it to work. There is a long list of bugs on Reddit and the Oculus Support forums, but no clean fixes to the problems. Most common problems are Missing Connection of the USB or DisplayPort, Restart Software loops, and Failed Rift S USB Hub (in Device Manager). The tech support for Oculus is a complete waist of time. It doesn't matter what the problem is or how to fix it, it's always your fault and there are never any clear fixes. AND don't get me started on the deal Oculus made with Facebook! My advice, do your homework. Don't take my review as the last word. Search Google for Oculus Rift S bugs!

I run a rig with a mere GTX 980. So far I have had no problems. The set up was smooth. Download the software, plug in the two wires and you are ready to go! Calibration was easy, and the Guard program is awesome. I love how you can trace the barriers in your home to provide a good safety net. It works like a fence. Try out the free games and programs offered by Oculus to give you a better command of the interface. I downloaded a couple of games that I had to pay for, Battlesky and Star Trek bridge crew.  Both programs ran really well, no lag or blurring. The depth perception  is uncanny! I recommend this to new VR players such as myself.

First I want to say I don’t leave many negative reviews, but buyers beware of this product until Oculus can fix the problem.This headset was awesome when it worked correctly. Then you start  having  nothing but USB issues. These issues are well know  by oculus and they don""t care. Read reviews on other websites if  you don't believe me. I have had two of the rift s and the same issue in both pairs.  so I returned them both. Again, I will say it was an awesome experience when they worked while flying  x plane.Keep in mind I had two units and both stopped working in less than a month.

Screen is noticeably better, god rays (which I thought were horrible in CV1) are essentially gone.  Frustratingly they're still in Oculus Quest.  Rift S is also significantly more comfortable than the other headsets as well.  Obviously the audio's a step down, but I just use some light earbuds.  Tracking's great, one cable's great (highly recommend clipping to belt loop with a little slack), and I haven't noticed the lower refresh rate.  Overall really pleased with the upgrade...obviously there's still room to grow, but I think it's a no brainer at $399.

The display is noticeably better from the CV1 so for games like DCS and War Thunder it is absolutely great. That really is the only thing that I think is better about the Rift S. If you enjoy FPS games while using a stock then do not buy this headset. The tracking constantly freezes if the controller remains still for any amount of time. Many people have contacted Oculus about the issue including myself, and there is no fix as of the day I am writing this review. When it is time to upgrade again I do not think I will going with Oculus. If you only play sims and games like beat saber then go for it.

Do yourself a favor and install the software BEFORE you buy the headset! If you can't install, you can't use it. Yay.To install the software you'll need *at least* 15G free on your a 'system drive' that's formatted in a specific way to NTFS, but not all NTFS formats work. All that space you have on your other drive? Useless. So unless your C drive is empty, good luck. Note that people in the forums say the space requirement is actually greater.

I’m in the same boat as the other customers with new PC's and not displayport: our son’s gaming computer has no displayport port so on Xmas morning, or afternoon (or night) we couldn’t play with it because his computer has only hdmi for the graphics card. Oh, and by the way, there is no adapter that can solve the problem. displayport > HDMI adapters exist, but apparently they do not work for this unit. If you have USB type C port, there are adapters, but that also does not work (we tried). Upshot: you cannot use this unit if your computer has no displayport. Yes I know, “why didn’t you read the small print?” A fair question, but my wife bought it for Christmas and did not even consider that a brand new VR device, MADE FOR USE WITH PC’s would not only not have a cord that connects with most gaming PC’s, but would not be able to connect at all no matter how ingenius you are with adapters. It is ridiculous. We will never buy a product from this company.

If you're using this product, you're going to have data mined from your experience, and that data will be sold to third-party companies.

It's been several weeks since launch, and the latest patches/updates are bringing the Headset to the ""ready for prime time"" status!  I have had the CV1 version for awhile, I love the Oculus ecosystem and contemplated if I should get the S or wait.  I'm so glad I got the S, the screens are so much better then the old Rift, 360 degree tracking without sensors/wires hanging all over the place, and the clarity is miles ahead of the old Rift! My S installed without any issues, still have the old CV1, although I'll never use it again, I may repurpose it as a bookend!  Remember to Opt into the Oculus Public Test Channel to stay in the loop with the latest updates/patches for your S!  I've tried allot of VR headset, yeah there are ""slightly"" better options out there, but they will also cost quite a bit more money!  Your getting a fantastic headset for the price of the S!

Barely used it till beyond came out, which was like a week ago. I played beyond for 1 and 1/2 days and the right controller has lost tracking. It can detect finger movements but cannot be moved and just floats in the air.Talk about a disappointment.

The Original HTC Vive and DK1 Oculus are my reference for this review. I've owned the headset for two weeks now and have recently installed a ceiling mount just a few days ago. I am using a 4690k @ 4.5ghz and GTX 1070 tiLet's get down to itPros:-The screen and refresh rate are good. I was worried about 80hz but can't say it's ever bothered me once and this is coming from a gamer who has been using a 144hz monitor for 5 years. The screen door effect is hardly ever noticeable if you're not looking for. God rays are still noticeable, but eh it's not terrible.Mixed:-The sound is garbage. BUT don't let that deter you. I have wireless earbuds and sometimes I don't even reach for them because music games are the only games I really miss good audio. I even had a friend with no VR reference comment on ""how good"" the audio was. Lol-The cable comes off the side? Why? Sometimes the cable gets in the way and the first question I ask is ""Why is the cable clip on the left side?"" Not a big deal but something I'd like Lenovo to answer.The bad:-The wire is ridiculous. It KILLS immersion. I have my ceiling mount now and that helps tons. Still, i'm annoyed Oculus does not offer a wireless solution for the Rift S much like the HTC Vive, Vive Pro, and Cosmos do. With the new hand tracking the Quest offers and Oculus Link, I can't help but feel left out as a Rift S owner.In Sum:The Oculus Rift S is a great headset to own if you already own a gaming PC. Perhaps you should consider buying a Quest given the new link upgrade but at the time of writing this during the holiday season, that may not be possible given stock issues. I will be updating this review as time goes on.

Overall, a lot of small, needed improvements over the original rift. Tracking is iffy close to the headset, as stated literally everywhere online, and every once and a while tracking seems to drop on controllers for maybe a quarter second. Not enough to intervene, and rotational still works fine (may just be my rig, who knows). My IPD is at 58, therefore I am right on the absolute minimum you can set the IPD. After being in VR for more than a three hours or so (which has only happened twice) I get a slight headache, I'd assume from the lack of mechanical IPD adjustment. Another thing to keep in mind, if your computer has any weaknesses, VR will find a way to make them noticeable. For example, I have a very old hard drive, and a lot of loading sequences can take a long while. I recommend having an SSD or very fast hard drive for loading in VR. All-in-all, I can recommend this to any newcomer to VR with ease of use and, the real kicker, the price.

 On Christmas of 2019, Santa brought a nice present to me, being this here Rift S. I was thrilled, but i was too oblivious to know it was too good to be true. Within 6 months of owning the Rift S, the tracking ring completely snapped off during normal use (navigating menus in Beat Saber, which may sound like an intense game but i'll have you know i'm horrible at it). This horrified me because i thought that this was ruined, and since Facebook is a scummy company i was sure they would do nothing about it. I was thoroughly surprised when they agreed to replace the controller since it broke during normal use, but within THREE DAYS of the new controller arriving, the battery compartment came completely loose and rattled inside the controller (which was annoying because batteries needed changing every 4 hours of gameplay, but that's another problem for later)So at this point i'm done. The horrible battery life, bad controller build quality and overall lack in features for this headset. The tracking is mediocre at best, and the 'interpreting' software misfires all the time causing your controllers to float away most of the time, while they dont track at all for the rest of the time.Genuinely disappointed. Save your money, buy an Index or Vive, but please, PLEASE listen to me when i tell you to stay away from this headset!

Do not waste your time with this thing. It has some serious issues that make it unusable for most people. Oculus has stopped supporting this headset but yet still continue to sell them.Do a Google search for ""rift S hand stuck in place"". The headset cameras will randomly just shut off and leave your hand tracking frozen. I tried everything I've ever found on the internet to fix this issue and it still persists, and there are many folks out there that have this same experience.

I had very few problems with the previous Rift model, but while I want to like the new device for its additional features, I've had a very frustrating experience with it.Every other time I've gone to use it, there's been an issue with no visuals and an unnecessary startup menu that can't be resolved by any consistent method I've discovered. I've troubleshooted it six ways from Sunday using both official and unofficial recommendations and can't shake the headache. Searching the problem online just turns up dozens of threads from half a year ago, none of whom managed to fix the issue themselves. At this point, even if I do work out a permanent solution, I would have a hard time recommending the device to anyone with less technical experience than I have.Additionally, one of the two controllers shipped seems to have a fault battery cover. It doesn't secure tightly and will, with mild pressure during the normal course of gameplay, slide off. This is not a problem I've previously experienced with Rift controllers. I may be able to get it replaced, but combined with the apparently unsolved and chronic black screen issues it doesn't inspire much confidence in other Oculus products.The device is perfectly fine when it's working, but if I'd known it would be this much of a hassle I wouldn't have upgraded.

This is my first VR headset and I wish I had picked a different one. The Rift is comfortable and intuitive to use, however its software leaves MUCH to be desired.Getting the headset to setup and connect was a herculean effort of scrounging through google searches for answers about why it wasn't detecting my headset or why the software wouldn't install. Running the safety video (silly me thought it would be a good idea to watch it) completely broke the software and required a complete reinstall.I still have issues with the updates. When an update is available, it gives me the option to ""Snooze for 4 hours"" or update now. The snooze feature works for only 15 minutes at best before it starts lagging out my game and bugging me about updating again. Trying to actually update rarely works the first time. It fails to update or download anything and asks me to restart my computer and try again. Sometimes it even does this multiple times in a row.The Oculus software is by far the worst big name software I have ever dealt with. The software issues alone are worth the extra $ to get a Vive instead.0/10 would not recommend.

Facebook announced Oculus will discontinue the Rift S starting in 2021. It's pointless to buy this product new because in a few months time it will be obsolete and unsupported. Aside from that this is a great entry level VR headset and despite some people's gripe with Facebook integration, you won't find a better full VR setup for the price. But since it's being killed off to get replaced by a shoddy mobile version with a shoddy link cable to connect to PC (Quest users know the pain) you're better off to buy this device used and not new since your 1 year warranty will likely not last until the final day this unit gets sold.The product is a solid 4 star product but Oculus/Facebook's actions negate that and end with a 1 star review.

I purchased this headset over other choices strictly due to convenience (Best Buy in-store with 15 day return policy), so I knew if I didn't like it I could return it. I've decided to keep it and so far have had a great experience. With that said, this is not the headset for everyone, and the complaints you're reading in the comments are very valid:- Make sure your computer has DisplayPort and USB 3.0 - you will need one of each. If you do have both, that is all you need to get this set up - no boxes, poles, extra outlets, etc.- Know your IPD before purchasing. You cannot adjust the lenses (a very strange design decision), meaning if your eyes are outside of the range this headset allows it will not be an ideal experience. I tested my IPD with a phone app which confirmed my IPD is around 64.5-66 and the visuals are great.- If you have minimal floor space or cannot set up tracking lighthouses, this is a great choice as motion tracking is done with the headset itself - all you need is the headset and controllers and you're set.- Because there is no external lighthouse tracking, controller tracking can get a bit wonky if they leave the vision of the headset (behind your head/body). In my experience this issue has not been a big deal and any inside-out tracking headset will come with this problem - it's just the trade-off of not having external trackers in your room. The good news is you won't need to worry about outlets for the lighthouses.If you are OK with some of the cons this headset has, it has plenty of pros that will make it a great experience, especially if you are breaking into the VR scene and want a balance of price, performance and ease of use. Just be sure you know what you're getting before taking the plunge on this one.

I bought this from the actual oculus store a few days after release day and I absolutely love it. The Rift S is way better then the go or any of the rift lines my 9 year daughter loves playing a few games and I enjoy almost everything about it the wires are pretty long and it’s only two ports to plug in computer the joysticks are very responsive and I love you don’t need to use external sensors because living in a condo you don’t have much space to set up sensors but you outline your imaginary wall and your set

The Oculus is a great product unfortunately Facebook has ruined it.  For starters if your banned or restricted for any reason on FB you cant use your Oculus account any more. If you deactivate your account you cant use it any more. They don't care if you spend hundreds of dollars in games. They will take it and not bat a single eyelash. If I still didnt change you mind. Please for the love of god only get steam games.

I got one of these for Christmas 2021 and LOVE it. The problem is it has been discontinued so finding replacement parts or even support from Oculas is hard.  Do yourself a favor and buy the newest Oculas or any newer VR headset. Just go to some of the VR chat rooms and research before you buy.

So I bought an Oculus Rift S brand new. It worked good at first but after a month, (only used on weekends for an hour or so) it started having all the issues that everyone else is having, sensor tracking issues, usb issues and the controllers are shown in the floor on the headset... nothing works . Oculus does not care at all. If you search these issues there are thousands of posts about the headset being a ""brick"" or paperweight at this point.  When I contacted Oculus they told me to unplug and plug it back in... right.... I dont think they have any clue whats going on but at this point the initial $400 I spent on it, $1000 in games and $500 in software and hardware trying anything to salvage this garbage is all gone.  Save your money and buy ANY OTHER VR device... or you will end up here.

Firstly, you will need to have a decent gaming rig and $100~$200 to purchase games and possibly your own streaming equipment. Secondly, you should not have to worry about banging into doors or walls and your controllers breaking, because in the few days I have had the Oculus Rift S, the controllers have been thrown onto the ground and made contact with several doors multiple times and they live on. Thirdly, go ahead and buy more AA batteries if you don't have any on standby. These controllers probably last ~16 hours with a single AA battery giving energy to each one. Lastly, my only complaint. Every time I exit out of the Oculus launcher I have to unplug and replug my USB 3.0 connection cable as for some reason it registers the cable as an unknown cable after I close the Oculus launcher. For me though, that doesn't matter as my computer is very easily accessible. And my specks to get a solid 80 FPS on Beat Saber is an i7-8700K, XFX RX 590 Fatboy and just 1 fan. So even if you do have a somewhat brutish PC build, games should work wonders and provide you with the enjoyment of a life time.

I have an Oculus Rift S. I am on my second one, after having them send me a replacement for the first one. A black screen in the headset has been the problem on both. The only support option is online, and although some of them are friendly, they copy/paste the same instructions to you over and over, even if the troubleshooting is not producing results. I would not recommend this system, especially if you are connecting via PC. I have an advanced alienware system that has plenty of horsepower and capacity to handle this, and it just flat out doesn't work. The support team has no answers, and simply tell me that they'll 'get back to me' via email....... it's not worth it!

The Oculus Rift S is the EASIEST PCVR headset to set up, AND offers a high quality experience. While some may say the inside-out tracking isn't the best, I have personally had no issues with it. If your computer is compatible, then it is well worth $400.I say ""if your PC is compatible"" because there are some important things to note. A lot of current gaming laptops only support VR using HDMI, and the Rift S uses Display Port. Even if you get a Display Port to USB C adapter, it likely still won't work unless that USB type C port is part of your main GPU. If you have an integrated graphics laptop, it will most likely not work. Also, for those with custom built PCs, your computer may have all of the necessary parts, but a lot of times the USB 3.0 ports will likely get overloaded when trying to use them with a VR headset. So I would recommend getting a powered USB 3.0 hub or a USB 3.0 part for your motherboard. This is simply to avoid your computer simply deactivating your USB 3.0 ports mid-game due to overloading (if your motherboard is strong enough and your power supply provides more than enough power then it should be fine).Anyways, the Oculus Rift S is the best value PCVR headset for the money. You get access to all PCVR games, for both Oculus store and Steam, AND it is a smooth and easy set-up (it is actually just plug and play).

The setup process was such a breeze!! No sensors to install, no re arranging furniture, just two cords that need to be plugged in and you are ready to go. I already had a gaming PC, so the Rift S was a no brainier for me.The tracking is excellent, as long as the room stays well lit. My wife turned off the lights when I was playing and it lost all of it's tracking ability.Within a few minutes of downloading games, I was cutting blocks in beat saber, and shooting bad guys in superhot! Oculus has done an amazing job of taking the pain out of VR. Having the flexibility of using the Oculus Store and the Steam VR Store has been the best. You have access to all of the exclusive Oculus games and all the must have Steam games, and steam allows for more modding.

Don't buy this. It will work fine for a while, and you'll think its great. Then it starts breaking. The mic now sounds so awful that people are constantly muting me, and I can't play for more than an hour before the tracking crashes and I get a ""no display port connection"" error. It's then just a waiting game until it decides it wants to work again, unless you want to play with your head in a fixed position and have your hands stuck in the floor. I have found no fixes for these problems and oculus support is a joke. They do not care about this product.

Unlike the original Rift and the Quest, with the Rift S you can't adjust the lens distance to account for varying pupillary distance. My interpupillary  distance is 57. The Rift S is fixed at 63.5. This, as it turns out, is a deal breaker for me, since no matter what I do, I can't make any adjustments to make everything come into focus. Definitely beware of this before buying.I will definitely be returning. Its unfortunate because it seemed the Rift S many significant upgrades. Unfortunately without the ability to bring everything into focus, none of that matters.

I've skipped the previous generation of VR headsets. I didn't like the external sensors, felt like they were inelegant and on the way. It doesn't help too that I live in a small apartment.When I heard that Oculus were coming out with new headsets, I checked it out, expecting to be disappointed once more because of the external sensors. To my surprise, both headsets (Rift S and Quest) did not require those sensors.Even then, I was still skeptical. I heard about WMR, which has inside-out tracking, but not very precise. When early reviewers were saying that the tracking was an improvement, I put my pre-order in.I took a day off when the thing came out, and I enjoyed my staycation in the metaverse. Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to get into VR. Finally I get to experience it in the comforts of my apartment.This is my first headset, and I am in love with it. I would have given 5 stars, but I took 1 out because the tracking does seem wonky when you hold it too close to the headset. Some games may suffer from this, especially FPS games where you have to keep your back hand near your eyes to aim properly. For the rest of the games, it's not a problem.If you've been on the fence in getting into VR, now's the perfect time to jump in and join us in the metaverse.

Don't listen to the negative reviews. I bought this thinking it would be terrible because I read so many negative reviews and I figured I'd have to send it back. Let me just say this...It is the best vr headset I've ever owned. Hands down. I have several pcvr hmds and this one is my favorite by far. So comfortable and convenient. Screen looks amazing and the controllers are quality made. People complain about the sound being too ""tinny"" but I found the sound to be fine. It isnt the best thing you'll ever hear but it is no where near as bad as the negative reviews say. It also provides good enough sound to keep you from needing headphones. But you always have the option for headphone if you'd rather. Yracking worked great in everything I played never felt like I was at a disadvantage. 10/10 would buy it again!

The headset is amazing, don’t get me wrong. I feel Iike its one of the best PCVR headsets out there. However, due to the terrible tech support from oculus I cannot recommend it. I had an issue that was fixed with a simple BIOS update to my motherboard but it took forums to fix because Oculus support ran me around in circles for three months. Other users have reported similar issues. Just look at the subreddit. It’s full of people trying to get tech support for the Rift S and failing.

After a week of owning the Rift S, everything was fine. Suddenly one day, I went into devices in the Oculus Software to see 14 RIGHT TOUCH CONTROLLERS WITH CORRUPTED SERIAL NUMBERS. Whenever I launched a game it would have a critical error and freeze because of the right touch controller glitch. Not to mention that every time I tried to launch steam VR it crashed. The worst thing about this product, however, IS THE FREAKING SUPPORT. After a week of being on support, they can't seem to help me one bit. They keep making me try things that DONT WORK. Its been a month and still they have yet to fix the issue. It also takes them 3-5 DAYS to respond to you because of ""high demand."" I have now demanded a refund instead of replacement but it seems that was too much for them because they have not responded. It has been a very horrific experience.

I love VR and have a WindowsHMD and PSVR. I've been trying for a long time to get my best friend into a a headset of his own and finally got him hyped up on the new Rift S release. We went out to get it for him at a best buy which had it in stock and brought it to my place for him to test it out. We went through the unpacking experience and hyped up on getting it set up only to find that one of the untalked about changes in the S version is a change from HDMI to DisplayPort which his computer did NOT have an outlet for. Needless to say, this ruined the fun for everyone and we couldn't find any adapters on the internet that could help the situation. If you do NOT HAVE DisplayPort do not get, otherwise have fun I guess...

I’ve had this device for a year now, it works for a good six months perfectly no issues, around 7th or 8th month the tracking tracking starts to become unstable and eventually completely annoying when it hiccups, sometimes completely unusable. Around the 10-11 month time frame the display port cord fails. Honestly if you’re looking for a cheap and effective option, go to the quest two I’ve hear way better things about it for $100 cheaper. Yes, I had enjoyment with it for the 6 months I could actually have fun with it but I was expecting more to be honest and am now switching to the quest 2.

I have the Rift and was going to wait for index because I thought it Rift S was not going to be much of an upgrade. Realized that I could upgrade my rift and then my teenage daughters could have my old one right in time for summer break. Sold! and am so glad I got the Rift S! I love the screen clarity and have very few tracking issues. Added some quality usb 3 and display extension cables. Then included my bed to my play area. Now I can sit in bed and watch YouTube, hulu and netflix! I can even tested some sit down games and they work great if I re-orientate my view.On the other hand, had a few black and static glitches as well. Sound is not so good but headphone work great. Im sure they will work out a lot of the release bugs over the next few months. Also seems Oculus intends to put out and audio patch, aka tweaked equalizer profile,  that should improve the built in sound. One other thing, seems tracking gets worse in dark rooms. Found out if I turn on a IR light from an old security camera, I can play in pitch black room with not tracking issues what so ever.  When you use pass through, its like wearing night vision goggles. What a pleasant surprise!! Anyways I am very satisfied and glad I didn't end up with buyers remorse.

First off, I love the gaming experience provided by my Rift S. That said, after moderate usage over the period of two months, it shorted out one of the USB 3.1 slots on my (asus - Z270e) motherboard. While in the middle of gaming, the headset simply went black whilst being accompanied by 'usb over current' errors. After numerous troubleshooting attempts, I was unable to boot, and was forced to purchase a new motherboard. Either plug this into a pci-e usb card, or a usb c to usb 3.1 adapter. The 900mA that USB 3.1 is rated for must be skating the razors edge of the necessary draw. USB C is rated for 3A, leaving far more cushion.

I purchased Rift S since last year and so far I managed to use it 3 times (when I said I use it for 3 times it is when I actually spent  5-10 hours to make it work and play it for duration more than an hour). Every time I want to use it I will face no DisplayPort issue and had been attempting to fix the issue applying all the fixes published by the community (read this clearly, by COMMUNITY.) while Oculus only giving excuses such as ""don't use 3rd party DP adapter or USB hubs"". Frankly speaking, I bought over 10+ display port adapter to mini display port online randomly and every single 1 of it work when I tested with my RIFT S when it actually works,Apparently Oculus really has no interest to fix this problem because every single forum I visited still having people experiencing this same issue.I would strongly suggest buyer to stay away from RIFT S till they actually fix the problem.

I was just interested in losing the sensors.  The S uses sensors in the headset.  The S also has a better sound set up.

It's a nicely price peripheral, but Occulus is increasingly being devoured by Facebook, requiring a sign in from a Facebook account as of next year. What's more, the Rift S is going to have support dropped in two years in favor of their standalone products.Overall, I don't recommend jumping in on this ecosystem now.

I ordered my Rift S through the oculus website as it wasn't available on amazon for a fair price. It took a few weeks to ship, but I am very patient so it did not bother me. When I first put it on and got it all set up, I was amazed as to how good the tracking was. My room doesn't have the best lighting, but it worked very well still. I played Superhot, Surgeon Simulator, and Zero Caliber and it worked flawlessly! My ONLY complaint is the crappy oculus software you are forced to run just to use the headset (even for steam VR). It has cool features, but its very buggy and hard to navigate. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this to somebody who is just getting into VR and wants something better than WMR that won't kill your wallet.

Completely worth every penny, for a $299 I'm impressed with the quality of everything, if it's your first VR experience you're not gonna be dissappointed, I was jawdropped with the intro and got a chill on my spine when I lift my controller and saw my virtual hand tracked, my brain glitched a few times. SteamVR worked flawlessly. Note some games will give you visual glitches, Subnautica for one has some bad steroscopy, best to go for a VR-Ready game like Half Life: Alyx and Star Wars: Squadrons. Only drawback is the headset is a bit heavy, it may takes some fiddling witht the strap and knob to get you to align your eyes with the fresnel lenses properly.

I am fully enjoying my Rift S. The visuals are awesome. They are the best I have seen and I own an Odyssey +, Oculus Go and PSVR. I am playing through Hellblade and visually it is stunning. I do not see any godrays. The og Rift has really bad godrays, at least for me. The screen door effect is also greatly reduced from the og Rift. The headset is the most comfortable I have tried. I found the og Rift to be comfortable but it fogged up on me all of the time. The Rift S is more comfortable and it has yet to fog up on me. The tracking has be perfect for me. I did not like having three sensors around my room with og Rift so I really like this solution. I have not had a problem with the audio.

First off. Anyone saying this isn't a good headset is full of s***!!! Now I'll list pros first.Pros: great picture , high graphic fidelity, (you have to look really hard to see pixels), excellent head tracking, comfortable, 80hz refresh is unnoticeable compared with original rift refresh. Now for cons.Cons: being tethered can get annoying. Because of cord being over my shoulder. I fixed this by adjusting cord on headset with a zip tie , so cord falls behind my head. Audio issues have been present with mic. I've heard reports of speakers giving problems too. However Oculus said they would be rolling out an update for this. In meantime use speaker/mic plug in. Now an extra note.Note: people have been complaining bout IPD . I have had no issues with the digital IPD adjustment and the picture looks fine. My advice. Measure your IPD and then go to settings and adjust it to match yours.Closing: For the money this is the best headset on the market. You can't go wrong with the Rift S or the Quest depending on your needs. VR on!

The VR is neat kids enjoyed it too a point but Oculus support is terrible. We have had Oculus for a bit and the display cable was damaged. This is common because the cord gets stepped on ext.  I wrote Oculus to get a replacement and after many emails and pictures sent they said NO?? They would not sell me one or replace the damaged one making the Oculus junk. I would not deal with Oculus again.

Beware of this company at all costs. They will not support their products, prematurely closing open tickets, claiming warranty issues aren't warranty issues even after we both quote the same warranty lines and overall refuse to support their product.If you want into VR, go with somebody else instead. If you do buy this, expect to be buying it as is, and good luck.

This is one of the best things that I have purchased. Display quality is amazing headset is mostly comfortable and not that heavy. I would recomend buying this if you have or plan to have a good pc. The only thing is if you have it on for too long the foam surrounding your eyes gets a bit itchy so I recomend getting a leather cover if it bothers you.

Waste of money if you own a laptop... read the wealth of threads spanning every online forum imaginable regarding it not working properly. Spent 24 hours sending incessant back and forth emails trying to troubleshoot only to inevitability have the support agent tell me the only conceivable next step is to try it on a friends computer as I only own one computer myself.

Broken out of box. Kiddo got it for Xmas, spent hours getting it set up only for the headset to disconnect when he takes it off (normal) but it WILL NOT reconnect when he put it back on. We tried re starting the computer, uninstalling and re-installing, troubleshooting did nothing.

Coming from the rift almost everything feels like a step backwards. The tracking is much worse, the quality feels much worse, the controllers are worse, and the optics are worse unless your eye spacing is average, and even then, the resolution improvement isn't that great. This feels like a cheap Windows VR headset and not what you'd expect from Oculus. Taking the CV1 and giving it a higher resolution would be 10 times better than this.

This item was great until the headset went black. It starts out ok and a minute into the game...nothing. I've unplugged the wire from the headset, I've unplugged from the computer, checked the drivers but nothing works.

Calling this beta would be a gross overstatement.The few times I've gotten it to work, it was awesome! The problem is, it never works.

I had a Go, then the original Rift with the sensors, I can tell you that this thing is noticeably better as soon as you put it on, tracking is smoother, graphics look cleaner, it has more features to make set up MUCH easier and its more comfortable to wear. Some people may not like the speaker sound and I read a few reviews about that, I can see what they mean, but for me it’s fine, I can never fully shut my senses off while playing so it’s its actually better for me, I used to sit the old ear phones off my ears a bit to hear outside noises, now it’s perfect.....for me. Plus it has the headphone jack if it’s that big a deal for you. If your on the fence I can tell you, don’t be, buy the thing a have fun, life’s to short!

This is the worst gaming product I’ve ever encountered. Why, and for what reason, would you not only use a superfluous cord that requires you buy an adapter (not included of course—for some reason?), but also not advertise outwardly that this specific product requires a gaming computer? I tried setting this up for an older couple and of course they did not have a computer with a usable gpu, but they wouldn’t even know that because of a lack of product messaging. An utter headache and potential waste of money.

I really do love this headset and I wish I could get it, but I believe its to expensive and could use a $50 cut in price. Of course this would never happen and I know nothing of manufacturing cost and the implications for oculus's other headsets and the coinciding prices.

Just 6 months after the original Rift stopped being sold, Oculus has stopped selling replacement cables for the headset. That's right, if your dog chews your cable or it just outright stops working, which is common for Oculus products, you are completely screwed and need to find a cable from ebay/craigslist or, get this, buy a refurbished headset and use that cable. That's right, if you contact oculus support they will suggest that you literally buy a new headset so that you can have a functioning cable. Capitalism at its finest.

This isn't a review, but it's to tell you that there are a lot of people that seem to be dis satisfied with there purchase. People claiming that because it's display port than they can play. When a laptop is oculous ready, that means rift. Not rift s. There are so many adapters online, for super cheap that you can buy, and actually use it, instead of rating one star and complaining when it could have been solved with a tiny bit of reaserch.

It might not be an amazing step up for Rift and Vive owners, but it is better than those 2 and if its your first VR system, it will blow your mind.

The hardware is fine and VR, when it works, can be wondrous. However, Oculus still, after years, hasn't gotten a grip on the software side, and using it is like a game of russian roulette. Sometimes the device works perfectly, but then they roll out an update that bricks it for an unforeseeable amount of time. Also, they have a bad habit of just stopping support of OS's retroactively, meaning that a forced update can turn your device into an expensive paperweight overnight. VR is great, but Oculus does not deserve your hard earned cash.

Great headset but this product is not built with families in mind. I have one VR ready PC and four people in the house ready to use this thing. Any apps you buy are tied to just one account. So no sharing of game purchases. No way for each kid to keep their own progress in games. EVERY popular game App Store (Steam, Xbox) lets you share purchases installed on the same device.

I originally had a Windows Mixed Reality headset and it had so many problems and then it just flat out stopped working. I got this recently and it has been amazing. $400 dollars is not pocket change, but compared to other high end headsets this is the best for your buck. My only issue is that for some reason I have to unplug it and plug it back in every time I want to use it, but that is nothing to take a star down for.

I did not get to use this item because the program was not compatible with my computer. My computer met the specs but could not download the app. It is suggested after you spend hundreds of dollars on the headset, that you buy a computer powered by Oculus that cost between $1500 and $2200 or more. Returned right away!

Very cool and I liked it. I ran into some errors on the setup like a black screen a few times. The games ran nice and smooth and the audio wasn’t as bad as others made it seem. However the thing that made me return this item was the tracking. It sucks. If you play any first person shooter the tracking gets all messed up and the hands get stuck and you have to move it around a bit to get the un stuck, not worth $400 to me go for htc vive or steam

I got this as it is much cheaper than the vive VR headsets (even the htc vive first gen), and having tried both I am glad I got the Oculus Rift S.  Great bang for the buck and you get access to both the Oculus and Steam stores for games.  It really is a blast.  Quick to setup and play.

I bought the Rift S from Best Buy and took it home only to discover that my laptop which easily clears all the specs won't work because they use a Display Port or Mini Display Port not HDMI. When I returned it the Geek Squad said this is typical. They only have a few high end gaming laptops that have these ports.

After having some issues with this thing myself, and spending most of my day troubleshooting, I have come to realize that this piece of junk has, and has had a ton of issues that Oculus has simply not bothered to fix.  I've got people telling me to disconnect my monitors, buy PCIe USB cards, try every USB and DP port, uninstall, reinstall, use this driver, use that driver, etc.  More trouble than it is worth.  The best part is that they do not have reliable support - you email or support a web ticket, no calls or chats, and it takes them days to reply.  This company and their hardware are garbage.  Go get a Vive instead.EDIT:I did finally hear back from Oculus, and they were unable to resolve my issue.  The solutions that were proposed were identical to the ones that I had read online: You have multiple monitors?  Disconnect all but 1.  Do you have an externally powered USB hub you could try to use?  Uninstall all of the software and reinstall it.  Eventually they simply suggested replacing the device and trying a new one.  I took their advice and returned it, but opted for a Vive Cosmos instead.  Setup was a breeze, I was using it within 40 minutes.  A bit more expensive, but you get what you pay for.  Oculus has gone downhill pretty quickly since being acquited by Facebook.  Probably because half of their efforts are going to badmouthing other VR solutions, such as the Vive models.  Avoid this product, and this company, like the plague that they are.  Get a Vive, or splurge and get an Index.  Oculus makes junk, and they know it.

Im an avid PC gamer, and Ive always wanted VR but never really thought about buying one until Rift S came out. I decided to purchase and I'm amazed.Pros -Really fun and can play for hours at a timeOnly 2 inputs USB/DisplayPort makes for an easy connectionCord is pretty long, so even using ceiling mounts for your cord shouldn't be a hassleCons - Minor issues upon installing oculus software, just a quick restart of the program workedMotion sickness, I went straight into a serious game before knowing you could get sick from virtual locomotion, and although it only lasted for 1 hour, I haven't been sick since and have been able to play more intense gamesAlthough there are speakers on the headset, there are no earphones/headphones to use. You can either plug in to the side of the headset, or connect a headset to your PC and put it over the vr headset, thats simply another cord to deal with, but ive found ways to play 360 with multiple cords around meLast but not least, space.You need at least a 3ftx3ft area to ""have guardian setup"" finished properly. I dont have that big of an area because I play in an extremely small room, so ive already scratched the controllers from me hitting things like my wall/table.Just make sure you have room.Ive had no issues since I've purchased the headset, (4 days ago) and I'm rating this 5-star because most of the issues are my side, (no room, motion sickness/not knowing when to stop playing, ect.)Would purchase it again, and would recommend to friends.

Improvements over Rift CV1:- No sensors stations, inside out tracking system is amazing compared to the 3 sensor setup I used with the CV1- Only requires 1 USB port- Significantly reduced 'god rays'- Sharper, slightly higher resolution image- Passthrough camera that you can activate by tapping the home button- If you have a desk/table in your environment, your controllers are still tracked if you have to reach under it thanks to the inside-out tracking, as long as your headset has a line of sight to them.Downgrades from CV1:- Integrated headband speaker quality is not as nice as the CV1 earphones- Slightly less comfortable initially, slightly more difficult to find a comfortable setting with the headband and strap.- SteamVR support is kinda iffy, though this review is being written in the first few weeks after releaseMixed:- No earphones, just integrated speakers.  This isn't 100% a downgrade as it is easier now to use your own headphones if you wish.- Redesigned controllers.  I still haven't gotten accustomed to them, but they aren't bad by any means.- No mechanical IPD adjustment, BUT, it can be adjusted with a press of the home button and going to settings, and variances in the distance are far less noticeable than the CV1.  The default setting works for everyone in my household.  It's a pro for me because it can't be changed on accident.Having owned both, if you have a CV1 and are happy with it there is very little reason to switch unless you have disposable money, or REALLY hate the sensors.  I only upgraded because my CV1 got broken and I couldn't just replace the headset without buying a whole new kit, or taking the chance on a second hand headset on E-Bay.

I wanted to enter Virtual Reality and considered the Rift S to be the best to aquire, considerring it can work on any modern computer (with a dedicated graphic board), and having a BETTER image as the Quest (which ran on its own...)... Little did I know at that time that you need a special video output on your computer, instead of the large spreaded HDMI... And I bought prior to that a gaming laptop that I considered using with the glasses.... of cousre, it had a HDMI video output.... and was NO MATCH to the Rift S on this matter! What the hack, I said... It must be somewhere a convertor to change the HDMI signals to Display Port or miniDisplay Port... Guess what? There isn't!!! So, now I have to sell my laptop (to which I cannot change its outputs...) and buy another one with that specific video port...And this was not all...Fortunatelly (I said...) I had also a stationary desktop computer, which had (what a luck!!!) all kind of video outputs, including Display Port.... I connected the headset to it, went through the setup... and no success!! The hand sensors were found, but the headset, not! Again, go to Oculus home page and read.... they said just to unplug the two cables, reinsert first the USB one, than the Video one.... Did that several time, no success!. Read what other users said about this on internet, nothing helped... What I did see, though, it was a strange flip of status when I monitored the starting of the headset with the configuring program (the one showing the two cables)> when the USB cable was in, the green check mark appeared, then, when connecting the video cable, first a green check mark, then, after 1-2 seconds, a red check mark (saying sensors not working, need to restart... hehehehe...). What I did was clicking on ""Continue"" button bellow right after seeing the glimp of the green mark, and VOILA! I had all sensors working! An lastly, I enjoyed the first VR experience! It worth it!!!!Of course, this happened SEVERAL times after that, but now, each time, I do that quick ""Continue"" and everithing is OK, I can enjoy hours of VR gaming...NOTE> It does not work unless you see the two cables connection screen, as otherwise you do not have any control when to ""activate"" the sensors, nor you have a ""Continue"" button in other setup screens...To me is clearly a FLAW in the software of the headset and Oculus should solve this problem, which is happening to a LOT of users....Otherwise, the headset is gorgeous, feel light and even you have a ""tail"" (cables to computer), you do not mind them too much... I would enhance, though, the optics, as you can see clearly in the central area, but a little blurry to the surounding/edges.I hope my posting will help other to make the right choice and/or start their Rifts, when they encounter the sensor's error mentioned above.

Why would a company design and manufacture a product that 2/3 of it's target audience can't use? Unfortunately,  the Rift-S requires a DisplayPort, Mini DispayPort or Thunderbolt C Port (for which you'd have to buy the appropriate adapter). We have a gaming laptop that exceeds all of the requirements to work except for the port.They don't make it clear in the PC requirements,  but if all you have is an HDMI connection,  you're out of luck. NO adapter will work. I tried a few configurations and after those failing and doing in depth on line research realized that there's no technical way around it (I work in IT).If all you have is an HDMI port, save yourself the headache and get the Oculus Quest. It doesn't have as many features,  but at least it will actually work.

I went for this headset because I wasn't sure how much I would like VR games/how much my motion sickness would cause me grief, and especially because I didn't want to wait the estimated 8+ weeks to get an index kit. I thought the biggest of my problems would be having to connect to a facebook account to even use it (which might not be much of an issue if you actually have/ use facebook- I don't), but I was wrong... Be aware that not all USB 3.0 ports are compatible with this headset, which they conveniently neglect to mention. I had to order a USB PCIe after I received this headset to even get it powered up. On top of that, it seems that it doesn't play nice with the display ports on certain graphics cards, so it isn't uncommon to have connectivity issues and constantly have the headset disconnect while you are in the middle of playing something, so I would recommend you specifically check up on the compatibility of your graphics card with this headset by looking up problems others have encountered, even if you have a pretty good card, because their customer support will ignore anything you include in an email and insist that your inability to plug in a USB and/or display port is the true issue.I kind of regret not just waiting for a different headset at this point since having to worry about keeping the headset connected just to play a game for a little bit when you are well above the system requirements shouldn't be a thing when you are paying a few hundred dollars, but hey, if you love stressing over micromanaging your hardware while playing games, this could be the headset for you.Edit: I got an index mid December and have had no issues with my display port or anything. I returned this product because it definitely had some defective hardware- it got to the point where it was disconnecting every 5-10 seconds while only running the app for the headset. I couldn't even load games through the oculus app. Two stars only because the lack of needing base stations can be convenient (albeit a bit buggy) if you can get it to play nice with your pc. If you intend to play VR games for more than a small amount of time, consider other options. Your eyes, sanity and pc will probably thank you.

So, it's super fun. It's easy to set up. The visual quality is pretty good (not top-tier, but this is a more budget-friendly system, so that's totally cool). Everything you love about VR, it's there. And the controllers are some of my favorite I've used.Some Cons: Some games that are meant to be compatible... aren't. They just don't work, for no apparent reason. Troubleshooting and online research did not help me to solve these issues, instead I just found a bunch of other people having the issues and they were also unresolved. SteamVR compatibility in particular is suuuuuper hit-and-miss.The inside-out tracking is super neat in that there's less setup, but it has also resulted in much more ""jumping"" or ""sliding"" visuals (even in a well lit room with good contrast) as compared to base-station headsets I've used. I also experience a bit of both visual and input lag, which is fine once adjusted to it, but it does make VR-sickness a bit more of a concern.But these are nitpicky details! Overall, I'm very pleased with it and for the price it's hard to beat.

This is an amazing starter VR for ppl wanting to get into VR but are on a budget (note a PC is needed with this head set). And can i ask what the heck you guys put in the batterys that come with the the headset? They lasted forever dude, 3 eight hour VR runs and still going.Pros-Inside out tracking= no base station setupMenu easy to navagatestock batterys seem to be made from a syfy film because they dont diefast trackingCons-No anolog eye adjustment only digital ( THIIS IS A BIG ISSUE WITH 30% OF THE WORLDS POPULATION NOT BEABLE TO USE THE OCULUS RIFT S)no base stations means no tracking behind you (doesnt matter 95% of time tho)

Considering the price of the Oculus Rift S in comparison to all the other VR headsets currently on the market, I’m very pleased with this purchase.  The image quality is great though there is some noticeable blurring in the periphery.  The headset is comfortable and lightweight.  The controllers are comfortable and responsive in real time with no noticeable lag.  Sound quality and depth is great and immersive.  The cord definitely gets in the way of a fully immersive experience though.  The additional cost for the quest 2s wireless experience may be worth it, though I have not used the quest 2 and cannot speak for its capabilities.I would give this five stars if it weren’t for the fact that you are REQUIRED to have and use a Facebook account to use the product at all.  Requiring your customers to use a service that is guaranteed to collect and sell data from their gaming sessions and gaming selections/searches is unethical and unnecessary and definitely strips a star from my review.  Otherwise, the device works well.This is a good introductory device to explore the possibilities of VR with.  I’ll definitely be upgrading to a system that doesn’t require Facebook in the near future.

My first ever VR headset I’ve bought and I’m beyond impressed, for the past two weeks I’ve been playing only 3 games, pavlov, beat saber, and rec room... there’s so many games out there and just 3 alone is enough to keep me addicted to it. The graphics are pretty impressive, the only downfall is older games that were released with the original oculus are I bit outdated on the graphics and can be a little fuzzy around the edges but games like Arizona sunshine are beautiful even with the game being released 4 years ago. But the newer games have had some time to smooth the roughness around the edges and I’m impressed! Overall this has been a great me experience from playing regular controller and keyboard games and I highly recommend this headset, it’s the cheapest on the market and the most user friendly.

Haven't actually opened the box yet.  However this is my 2nd Oculus Rift S purchase and VR is an indescribably different experience (there are better experiences but I'm not going there) and the ""S"" works great.  I really should open the box and at least test them.Looming problem:I need to find out if Facebook is going to turn these into a paperweight with 2 magnifying lenses and 1 LCD screen, when they tell me my Facebook account (required for Facebook to spy on you and to activate your Oculus Rift S) has been shut down and my Oculus Rift S has been ""bricked"" or ""paperweighted"".  I wanted to give it 2.5 stars (the average for the Oculus S -- 5 Stars and Facebook -- Zero stars but instead I gave it generous 3 Stars.

The Rift S may have been top of the line previously but something has obviously changed. Oculus software is required to use the Rift S and is buggy and unstable. Also takes up a LARGE amount of system resources even when you are playing SteamVR.The Rift S is so finicky to play with. Every time I take off the headset, it loses settings and I have to either re-setup the headset or reinstall the Oculus software. This has occurred on every computer no matter the specs. The built-in guardian software loses its barriers every time you take the headset off and this is all BEFORE YOU EVEN PLAY A GAME.I should have just bought an Index or Cosmos

So I have a laptop, and I all I knew is that my laptop has a bunch of different ports, so I wasn't worried about anything after reading the reviews. However my laptop does not have the video port with or without the converter that this came with. I'm still super excited to use this even tho I had to go buy a converter that goes from the original video port to a type c which I know for a fact my laptop has thoseUpdate: no reply from anyone about anything. Instead I bought an Oculus Quest 2 and that has an easy setup and connection to everything, even to my laptop. However I am able to use this now that I also bought a gaming PC. I would still not recommend this unless you have a gaming PC which has a display port, otherwise this oculus rift is as good as a paper weight.

The headsets 3d immersion is quite incredible in the sense that the headset can almost perfectly track your surrounding so while moving inside the vr headset, you truly do feel as if you are in the virtual world.However still, there are fatal issues with this headset.1. Too hot. While in use, your head and eyes can quickly start to overhead!2. Eye straining. This headset seems to cause serious eye straining very quick.3. Expensive titles. Ok, Im not completely blaming oculus for this, but most vr titles seem to be priced 20$ or more.4. Low resolution. The resolution on this is too low. Some reviews suggested you could watch movies in here, but will such low res, that is impracticle.5. Limited movement. I wish oculus would add some sort of wireless / bluetooth capabilities with these. I can only be maybe 8 ft from my pc and if the room with my pc is small, this headset just wont do. It needs space.

A definite improvement over previous models--this headset is awesome. The visuals are perfect and it fits well with/without glasses (without the random blurring/readjusting I've noticed a lot with the previous rift..). The built-in sensors and ""guardian"" (play area) make it safer to play alone (no more putting a fist through the wall when you wander a bit too far away from your starting area lol) ;) Controllers are very comfortable to hold/use as well. It was easy to hook up and get started and works well with Oculus/Steam VR games. Have been strongly recommending this to everyone.

I've had the Rift S for a few days and all I can say is that the headset runs titles such as Half Life: Alyx and The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners just fine, but I have ran into some lag spikes but it could be just my PC. The only problems I run into is when starting up my computer, sometimes the headset disconnects and I have to unplug everything and plug it back in, which I don't mind doing at all since it's a simple fix. The software for the headset is also somewhat buggy but all I've had to do was close and reopen it or restart my computer.The tracking on the headset is really good, though for the price. Compared to the Valve Index, which can track ALL of your fingers, the Rift S can only track your thumb and index finger.In conclusion, I would recommend this headset to ALL people who are starting out and want to dip their toes into VR. I do recommend this over the Quest 2 due to the fact that this headset relies on your PC to function, which means better graphics compared to the Quest.

I've used 5 different headsets before and owned 2. The rift dk2, and OSVR hdk2 are the ones that I owned in the past. I have also tried the quest, vive cosmos, and the original vive. I think that if you already have a PC powerful enough for it, this is the easiest sell. Not as good at tracking as the Vive, but better than the cosmos. But easy to set up, I had it working flawlessly within an hour, most of that time being spent installing windows 10 and making a Facebook account. The price for this is right, the build quality is forgivable (the right controller for mine squeaks when shaken).The most important con though is that there is no physical setting for interpupilary distance, it's just software. So if you think that may be a problem, this is a harder sell.

I know the price is great, overall the quality and build style of this VR headset is great too, but the lack luster microphone is really really bad. I was STRUGGLING to find ways to fix the microphone. The solution that I found was using my gaming headset from my computer, input that into the audio jack on the VR headset while i re-attached the microphone that the gaming headset came with. Luckily the headset picked up that the headset was able to use both as a microphone and headset at the same time and was able to use that. Quality is 10x better now, but VERY UNFORTUNATE of the quality that it comes with. You'd think that it was be useable to a very little extent, but no one was EVER able to understand me and told me that the microphone was making me sound robotic and I could never was about to get a full sentence to someone.Overall: The VR headset is fantastic! Motion sickness is not there, the headset is plug and play which is AMAZING, super easy to setup and play! Great gaming investment.

This product was great for the first 20 minutes after installation. Offered a great experience getting into the device with interactive objectives and really showing the potential of immersion. As soon as I downloaded and started up my first game (beat saber), this thing continuously crashes. The display port was detected on initial install but supposedly keeps disconnecting now. I’m not sure if it is software or hardware but I haven’t been able to do anything about it ever since the first crash. All my components are far past the requirements, reinstalled my graphics drivers, turned off power saving, and everything else, but still nothing.

For me I accidentally banged on the wall while I was in VR (I'm big stupid) and the vibration on my left hand thingy stopped working.

I can't describe how much rage fills me every time I boot up the oculus rift s, the games all lag, but only in the headset (I have a higher end gaming computer, so that cant be an excuse). But the real thing that grinds my gears is the controllers, the battery life is usually wrong so you will get constant pop ups telling you the battery is dead, but if you look at the devices menu they are fine. Also, if I shake my right controller just a little too hard the battery disconnects and turns the controller off for about 3 seconds at least. and you may be saying ""well that's not too bad"" well you will definitely think its bad once your in the middle of an expert level song on beat saber and your controller turns off forcing you to fail the level and restart.P.S. I am not a person who mistreats my devices, this has been a problem since arrival, and I have tried to just suck it up ever since.Piece of actual junk, I regret not saving up for the Valve index or HTC vive everytime I start the vr.

It's been discontinued and becoming hard to find, but it's the best entry level headset for a person with a gaming PC setup since it's only $300 and imo, it blows Quest II away on visual clarity alone. Until these become impossible to find i recommend this as an entry level headset. Most people will point you to a Quest II but i returned mine and kept the Rift S as it's better suited for my library of games on steam and oculus.

If you only have an hdmi port on your laptop dont buy , it wont work no matter what you try to do, you need a display port , or a mini display port, thankfully i can return this 400$ sleeping mask and get my money back, they updated this thing for the worse.

This is a amazing be headset BUT read the required specs my friend ordered one and he didn’t have the minimum specs so it didn’t work on his pc but otherwise I haven’t had any problems with it.

This was used.  It worked once, but ever since I cannot get it to detect the sensors.  So it won't work.  I've tried uninstalling/reinstalling the software but no good.

get a wireless adapter for it, the big cable jumping all over you when turning gets annoying, i suggest a wireless adapter for this, other than that this is amazing
