Pros:__________•  Very comfortable on the head as there is an electric strap that goes around your head and one on top. Being a previous oculus owner, it’s like putting on a baseball cap. Overall it’s super easy to adjust and the foam fabric is snugged all around.•  One of the few times I’m glad they still go with a plastic covering.  You’re wearing this so the goal is to get it as light as possible.•  Wireless, and…I mention wireless!  No wires in any way. No PC’s, just put it on and begin.•  Not disconnections from Wi-Fi, as it’s consistent throughout.•  Oculus once again put some good effort into their built-in speakers. Very loud and immersive, while at the same time being aware of what going on in “your” world.•  The built-in headphone jack is always great if you want to be fully immersed.  I have to admit that I use the headphone jacks a lot more than I thought (especially in some horror games).•  For more insight on the speakers, it’s an integrated backward setup.  The result makes you feel that the sound is playing in all directions and not just focused on one place.•  The Insight program is AWESOME! I’ve owned previous Oculus and one of the most annoying things is taking off the VR set because the outside world got in the way.  That’s losing my VR controller after watching something on the Rift or just hitting the wall. With the new four mounted cameras, the Quest now can show you when you’re about to hit the wall. This is probably one of the best features they put in because now the Oculus monitors all your movements in the real world and just inputs them in whatever game. This is a dream for those who live in tiny/cramped rooms.•  The Insight program basically allows you to play in almost any room of your choosing because it maps out the space where you're at (It’s like setting up a border you can play in).  I say this is awesome again because the games you play will now be, somewhat, customized to the space you’re in. Having this feature is such a relief (that includes jumping or crouching, as it will be registered in the game, if allowed.).•  The resolution is beautiful for those who never used an Oculus, and it’s a nice upgrade from the Oculus Go (For non VR users, the overall resolution is an awesome sight. Not perfect, but it’s still great.)•  Gaming setup takes probably 30 seconds. Just pick the game in your library and have fun.•  The app works on the phone and in the Oculus. Newcomers, you’ll most likely buy games using your phone, like going through an app store. They have it on the Oculus, but the phone is a lot quicker to scroll and interact.•  The screen itself is very clean. Just remember to treat it right. One scratch and any game or movie will be wasted since your focus will be on that scratch.  Avoid this by putting it in its box (or a case, if you bought one) every time you finished.  Don’t just toss it aside.•  The tracking capabilities are spot on when I’m playing a game or viewing a 360-degree video.•  72Hz refresh rate. Just means that everything is smooth and non-glitchy. It also means less motion blur which that means less motion sickness for those who get it.•  A huge section of games.  From the date of my review, 50 launch games for this VR.•  You can not only play games that are made and run from the previous Oculus (I believe only the most recent versions), but you can also be able to play against your friends who only have the older versions.  I haven’t tested this layout yet as the only thing close to this is VR poker (which is fun, only if people actually talk in the game!)•  The games I’ve mainly played is so far “Rise to Glory” and “Beat Saber.” The controllers are accurate, the speakers are loud, and the experience is quiet a ride.•  Deleting games is just as easy as starting them. This is good to know because, depending on your games/movies, you may have to do some spring cleaning every now and then.•  I moved to my bedroom to the living room and I found the reconfigure border mapping very quick.•  The Passthrough view is the system that allows you to see your world without taking the set. To me, it’s kinda like a black and white night vision camera when viewing your world through the goggles. The four cameras are your eyes what they see, you’ll see (not perfect, but viewable).•  When you’re about to past one of your play borders, the controller turns red.•  Those who have glasses, the Oculus does come with a spacer for your glasses.  I don’t use glasses so you need to read other reviewers who have them.•  Putting the Oculus on it knows when I put it on and will wake up.  This is also cool because you don’t even need to press any button to begin.  But, to save power, I turn it off when I’m done. The bootup time is short anyway.•  Yes, this is mainly for gaming, but honestly some of my favorite apps are Netflix, Sling, and Oculus’s short videos.  Playing Netflix on this is an incredible sight and overall surfing the web and watching live TV on a movie theater size screen is an awesome experience.  No glares, no annoyances, no nothing.•  The touch controllers feel very solid, easy to use, a nice click response, and the grip for each button is a great design feature.•  Does come with an extra-long USB power cable so you can still enjoy playing your games while it’s charging.•  The Quest can track up to 4,000 square feet.  Something that you should know for those who will be playing in a room bigger than this.•  Great warning singles if you’re about to step out of your gaming borders.•  It does remember up to five different locations that you mapped out when making your border.  I only have two locations, but when I put the Quest on in one of those rooms, it instantly recognizes it.•  The VR market is run by Oculus. You think VR, you think Oculus.Cons and Oks:__________•  It’s expensive for the machine. This is not including any really cool games that you have to buy in the store.  Yes, there are some nice free ones, but in my experience the best games you’ll have to pay up.•  The games are not near to PC graphics but I would think around Nintendo Wii style of graphics.  Keep in mind it’s still a bump in the previous version and this is an on-the-go type of VR. For great graphics, you’ll need a stronger computer to take on the challenge.  Putting something that powerful in a tiny box is not there yet. Overall it’s still good for a casual gaming experience, just not ‘O My God.”•  Battery life is an average, for me 2 hours.  Maybe 2:30 if I’m just watching a movie or surfing the web / YouTube. Kind of the same battery life as the Oculus Go.•  VR is still new, so you are limited in the games for playing VR.  Since VR is not the mainstream there will be a setback on new games and, as mention before, higher cost to play prettier games.•  You can’t play this outside. The sun is a big no-no for the lenses and cameras, as it will track off incorrectly. But something this pricey you can’t trust the outside world. It’s like walking on the sidewalk with your running PC, or gaming console. Leave it indoors (plus you’ll look like an idiot playing this in public).•  More demanding games will eat more of your battery up.•  Controllers require AA batteries. We live in a battery charging world so why is this even allowed?•  Not only that, but I’m replacing these controller batteries a lot more than I should.•  It’s a great experience to view the VR screen but you must know that it’s nowhere near photo realistic. On a white screen, I can see every little pixel in works.  Still a great view, but nowhere realistic, an overall grainy look.•  The built-in speakers are loud but to fully immerse you’ll need headphones.•  I personally notice that the touch controller batter covers are a little loose.•  No tracking data underneath the headset.  You need to make sure that the controllers are in view in front of you in order of the headset to track it.•  Any outside light still leaks through the nosepiece.  It’s really insignificant in gaming, but watching a movie is a whole other experience.  For a movie, I have to turn off the lights.•  Even at 72Hz, you’ll still get a little nauseous. I don’t get very often but I’ll admit playing “Dead and Buried” made feel a little uneasy.•  I was told you won’t be able to play all of Oculus Rift games. That kind of sucks for those who spend a decent amount of money on Rift games.•  A price like this is greater than a PlayStation or an Xbox.  Both have hundreds top of the line graphic games and millions of users.•  A couple of times the controllers froze up when I accidentally hit both of them together when playing. I had to pull out the batteries in order for them to work again.  Hopefully, this will be resolved with a software update.•  Taking out the Oculus is easy but it’s still large task to pack it anywhere. For example, putting in my backpack does take a big bite out of storage.  Note that if you’re planning to give this to someone for a birthday or a holiday, out of state, its best you give them a picture of it and tell them one will be shipped to you.  When I got my Oculus Go, I was away from home and it was such a burden to find room when I needed to fly back.  The Quest is no exception.•  The concept of portable really means moving it from one room to another.  Anything other than that is a significant hassle.•  Any Rift games that have high resolution, if the Quest can play them, it may run at lower resolutions.  The reason why is to optimize the lower-powered Snapdragon chip.•  My friend has a big head and was having no comfort in using the Oculus.•  I play for a long time it notices that the straps do make your head itchy.•  You’ll need a phone to initially set up. Really not a big deal in the world we live in.•  Charging fully, without playing takes two hours for me.•  Charging fully, while playing games, never happen to me.  In fact, there were some times that I was on 0-1% battery life, and the only reason it was working was that I was charging it at the same time. Playing high graphics games will not allow you to charge fully, but watching movies will.•  IMPORTANT: It does not heat up quickly.  This is a major issue for those who live in a cold environment.  I discovered this after my second day working the Oculus, but if you live in a cold environment your lenses will fog up almost instantly.  Since our bodies create heat, putting on the headset, your eyes give off heat that makes the lenses foggy.  This goes away either the temperature outside is warm or the Oculus is warmed up with use.  For those who live in cold environments, beware! You’ll need to play either a high graphics game to kill the lens fog or keep breathing on the lenses itself. If you decide to just watch a movie, you may be in for a surprise when your entire screen gets fogged. There is no way around this.•  Looks wise, the Quest’s appearance is almost the same as the Rift.•  Oculus app does allow you to cast on-screen action to a second display, but I notice some lag in this.•  On some high graphics games, the login time does take some time.•  Twice so far I had re-draw my borders in my room as the Quest, I guess, forgot to memorize one of my rooms.  I don’t know if this a user error on me or a software error, but it’s worth noting.•  Those of you who used the 2016 Oculus controllers, there isn’t much a change.•  The headset will not sense obstacles on the fly. You need to trust your space.•  The Oculus 360 videos are really simple that even a 4-year-old Oculus machine can run.  We need videos that need to fit with the resolution that it’s currently built for.•  Still takes some time trying to find the sweet spot for your eyes.  I wish the headset will guide you in finding the correct sweet spot for your eyes.•  Lastly looking through the lens is the same as looking through an old PC monitor.  Your eyes start to get irritated after a decent amount of time in. Luckily by that time, the battery will be dead.Bottom Line:__________In the end, this is a great VR headset that will be perfect for those who want to get in the VR experience.  Please note that this is in no way a replacement for any game console, rather than this is just a new toy.  The issue with VR is that it isn’t really popular right now.  Not only that but, for me, it does take time to get the VR in use before playing.  You have put it on, get comfortable, and make sure that you have enough battery life.  Unlike any other console, all you have to do it is turn it on, press play, and away you go. In the end, such a small portable VR does has drawbacks, as you can see from the ""Cons"" above.The Oculus Quest doesn’t really give us a step closer to a fully immerse experience but it’s still a fun toy to play with.  If you have some extra cash then pick it up because it’s a great VR set (The camera system alone is worth the buy.). For those who want to get into VR than this a way to go 100%.Overall: Excellent casual gaming, great video streaming, and an all right battery system. For the common user this is a great buy, but for those who been here before, it’s a decent upgrade in portable VR.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer.

The Pros, Cons and Oks for Oculus Quest (HR).

2022-05-22 14:01:13.516468,"
So I've used all the big VR devices up to this point and I feel the Quest is the beginning of where the mass market can finally get into them.Having it be wireless reduces all the setup that's normally associated with any headset. Convenience goes a long way.ComfortWhile the PSVR is my vote for most comfortable headset, primarily cause of the weight distribution and how airy the inside feels, the quest fits nice and feel solid. I got a little warm after about 2 hours of playing, my forehead was sweating after running around my living room beating up robots. But it felt appropriate, not too hot, just sweat from playing an active game.Image Quality and PerformanceThe quest had no noticable screen door effect, one of my biggest issues with the Vive, and throughout my initial play sessions never had a stutter or graphic issue. It played nice and smooth. I didn't feel sick. And more demanding games like Robo recall ran flawlessly.TrackingFlawless. Hands, head, and room. No issues with any. Makes room vr sensors seem prehistoric. And from opening the box to being in a game took maybe 4 minutes (excluding a software update that took about 5 minutes).FeaturesOne of the most interesting built in features is casting. I can send the headset image to my phone, and then to other devices, with just the hit of a button. You can also record and other things. That's very nice when you're showing someone who is less familiar with VR, since you can follow along with them on your phone. Also probably good if you're into streaming and all that.SoundI think I'll end up buying the official oculus headphones. Not cause the sound isnt good, it is, but because I want to play quieter. The speakers are pretty loud.And as a final note, I get about 2.5 hours of playtime before deciding to charge it. It comes with a very long USBC cable and works well with battery packs.My only complaint so far is the battery slider on the controllers is in a very.. weird spot. And they can slide if you're gripping too hard and jerk around. Not a deal breaker, just weird. Easily fixed with a tiny piece of tape or something. Or not holding the controller in a way that could cause the battery case to slide open.

Pros:-PS2 Level graphics. This maybe generous, but they were better than I expected.-Cable free lets you explore around as much as you want. Define the room size during setup-The most fun you can have for $400Cons:-PS2 Level graphics (Rift S users may not be impressed)-Virtual wall isnt always visible when you need it. Accidentally punched real life wall during Creed demo.-Multiplayer logistics might be challengingConclusion: this was my first VR headset to own, and I walked away from my first experience thinking ""video games will never be the same."" It's too good and too fun.

 Wow. I got more then I expected and I just can’t stop playing. Beat saber, super hot, etc, etc, everything is thrilling, action packed, and amazing because you can move around, and it is almost like the system senses your body by what it can do in certain games. It’s  literally great because IM GETTING EXERCISE WHILE HAVING FUN! I can go on for hours playing and just not stop. The setup is easy, the colors are beautiful, and once you tighten and fit it on your head correctly, the picture is great. The description is exactly what you get if not more. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

When Alexa notified me that my package arrived containing the long-awaited Oculus Quest, it was like waking up on Christmas morning.  I could hardly stand the obligatory setup process.  (NOTE: Be sure to update your Oculus app on your phone before the package arrives, to avoid another 5 minutes of impatience.)  With the app updated the new hardware was available to add to my list of Oculus Go's.  (I'm fortunate enough that VR is part of my job.)Ah!  The bright and beautiful screen!  I have always been impressed with the bright, sharp Oculus Go screens, and this one was every bit as beautiful.  I'm also thankful to report that YouTube is available on this device.  What a pain it has been on the Rift to watch a simple YouTube video, but I digress.Then I loaded and launched Rec Room.  Ugh.  I'm not sure yet whether the Rec Room porting is a fail, or the Oculus Quest is just not capable enough, but in the end, the experience was much less than stellar.  New gamers might not notice and just accept the lag, but so far, if you're a VR gamer, then you might want to wait this out.  I'm usually a top player in Rec Room paintball, but my senses are honed to detect movement, and peripheral movement detection was all but absent.  Normally, I'm just a split second ahead of my opponent on Rec Room, but alas, the lag between action and result was poor.  Just like with James Holzhauer, if you're not quick on the trigger: you lose.The weight of the device didn't seem like that big of a deal, but even after 20 minutes (before the initial charge wore off and it was alerting me that the battery was dying), the material between the mask and my forehead was already starting to irritate my skin and leave a red mark.  Like picking up the guitar again after a long hiatus, I might grow some callouses and get used to it.There seemed to be a small ""sweet spot"" for visual clarity, and when you find it, the image looks great!  But in gaming, as you move your head quickly from side to side, the inertia moves the visual center.  This can be overcome by tightening the straps, but raises the discomfort mentioned above.Overall, I'm pleased with the device.  It's just not as capable in the area of gaming as I was hoping.  In that regard, I should have gone with the Rift S.  I'd buy one, but my allowance is spent for the time being.Pros:• Bright, sharp screen• Non-tethered (duh!)• My wife or a guest can finally join me in VR!Cons:• Battery life• Lag when gaming• Resolution when gaming• Uncomfortable and weightyI hope this helps in your deliberations on which headset to buy.  Don't take my review as overly critical.  I just want gamers to be informed that this is not the system.  For non-gamers, this will definitely open up a wondrous world of discovery, allowing people to travel places and experience things they would otherwise never see.UPDATE - 05/29/2019:It would seem that the lag on Rec Room has improved, but with the lack of detail in the display and responsiveness of the controls, I regretfully stand by the three-star review.  Please keep in mind that my review is based upon comparisons with the computer-connected Oculus Rift.  If you are buying this without having a computer-connected reference point, or your goal is explicitly for the wireless, no-computer-required, VR experience, then I would expect your experience to rival mine.  Everyone to whom I have shown this device is delighted with the experience and I am quite certain you will enjoy it too!  For me, just for the ability to open up my home computer-tethered VR experience to many who are new to VR has been well worth the investment.<b>Still, I yearned for an Oculus-Rift-like gaming experience - unplugged - and the Quest isn't horrible at it, but it isn't excellent either. Hence, the three-star review.</b>  For non-gaming, the visual experience is a marked improvement, and the ability to roam free, as it were, is awesome!  I do wish they had used a softer material in the facepiece.  Even though the battery life isn't phenomenal, my face wears out quicker than the battery does.  I'm pleased with my purchase; I'm just not ecstatic about it.

I paid full price for a new device and was delivered a scuffed used headset and controllers. IT WAS STILL LOGGED IN TO THE OLD OWNERS OCULUS ACCOUNT!I tested a few games on his account and it works fine, but has white scuff marks from apparently being bashed into a wall. See pics.Im seeking a partial refund because the device is functional and tbh dont want to wait another frickin month, but my unboxing experience of opening a beat up box, with scuff marks and a dead battery was horrendous.And to top it all off, once i charged it and turned it on, it greets me with Hello Daniel!My name is not Daniel. So pheonixgamer235 or whatever (he looked to be about 11, browser was still logged into his instagram) dont worry I factory reset the device myself and didnt spend any of your parents money on games.UPDATE: no response from oculus support, amazon support has a team setup to handle this apparantly, as i was redirected to them specifically. Was offered 10% I do not feel this is enough. The left controller has been spotty and loses tracking occasionally. Other tha  that fully functional, bump it up to 25% and I'll do it but pending more testing I may be fully returning this.

I feel like I waited years for this to come out and I couldn't be more let down. The low resolution literally hurts my eyes. It makes it impossible to do some of the things I was most excited about -- besides play games I couldn't wait to watch Netflix and other shows, but there's no way I could enjoy watching anything on this. Unfortunately I am going to have to return this and wait another couple years for a higher resolution version.

I had a Gen 1 Rift since it was released, upgraded to 3 sensors and the motion controllers but I must say the cable and setup and issue that something blocked my sensors was holding my back. So much so that I actually never used it much despite always being fascinated with VR.Now I have to say that the Quest just arrived, so take my opinion with a pinch of salt as its all still new. But having played a round of table tennis on this device I must say not having to worry about sensors, cables and being able to pick the room with the most space for my VR games is just on another level. After I few minutes I was jumping through my living room and getting an actual sweat in, like I was actually playing table tennis.Yes, the graphics could be improved, FoV refresh rate etc. But once you are in the game being able to freely move around in virtual space with your hands tracked accurately, lets you forget about everything else.As the unit if a fully self-contained gaming console essentially, this for me is the most revolutionary console released since a long time, if not at all.VR was always difficult to explain to another person, but with the Quest you can just bring it to your friends and family and have them experience it. Hence I am convinced this device has a good chance to bring mass adoption to VR gaming.

The Quest could be a good platform, but unfortunately Oculus's draconian anti-consumer business practices make it a bad choice. Oculus showed their true colors in the early days when they decided to try to ban Revive, a program which allowed legitimately purchased Oculus games on HTC's Vive. They've continued these anti-consumer, anti-competitive practices with the Rift. Oculus has elected to block Virtual Desktop from streaming desktop VR games that consumers had legitimately purchased, many of which were simply unavailable on the Quest, with no reason given beyond the obvious. They have also blocked a number of developers' games such as To The Top without good reason. The Quest could be great, but unfortunately the platform is compromised by Oculus's greed. Don't support anti-consumer practices. Don't buy the Quest.

I've owned a Oculus Rift DK2, a HTC Vive and a Samsung Odyssey. My VR PC(7700k/1080Ti) cost me over $2000. The Quest cost $400 and works by just putting it on right out of the box. No plugging anything into anything else. No installing anything on a PC. No setting up sensors on your wall. Nothing. You take it out of the box, put it on and get into VR. This doesn't make sense.This piece of hardware shouldn't exist for another 3-5 years but here it is. AND IT'S GOOD. REALLY GOOD. So good that, for me, it's been on par with my $2500 PC-VR setup. Yes. a $400 headset that utilizes a mobile system-on-a-chip is giving me as good a VR experience as a PC Master Race VR setup.If you're on the fence, GET THE OCULUS QUEST. As a VR enthusiast, this thing is frickin' amazing. You will not regret it.

I’m a huge gamer, but always felt VR wasn’t where I needed it to be for me personally. After waiting nearly 20 years from when I was standing in a small circular stand looking at Green lines (VR), I felt the Quest might have been what I was waiting for.  Oculus Quest blew my expectations away. I’ve been freaking out telling everyone I know how amazing it is. At one point playing Superhot I was going to step off a building and my body wouldn’t let me do it. I started breathing heavy and actually had to lift up the headset to tell my brain “no look we really will be fine”. I spent 9.5 hours in the quest (purchased and Anker power pack) and purchased 80% of the games out there. Thank you Oculus for this all in one, wireless and extremely immersive system. After a lifetime of gaming (starting with Pong-I’ve owned literally every system) I feel this was the greatest and most exhilarating gaming experience of my life. It felt like I was on Star Trek’s Holodeck. Amazing! I’d recommend getting: Superhot, Drop Dead, Beat Saber, I Expect You to Die, Sport Scramble

There seems to be a major problem with the Oculus Quest charging. I purchased 2 units. After 3 weeks, neither would charge anymore. Left to charge for 3 days it went from 3% to 11% with no use. Oculus does not have a customer support number. You have to send an email. Then, they don’t get back to you. My 900 dollars worth of units are useless after 3 weeks. Google it. Everyone has the same issue. Nothing from Oculus. Very, very disappointing.

A recent firmware update has caused the Quest units to experience brief, intermittent blackouts in addition to tracking issues.  This is confirmed by hundreds of people on the reddit forums.  Oculus support is useless, since they do not publicly acknowledge that the problem is firmware related, and instead tell you to perform factory resets, do reboots, change play spaces, etc.  Rather than admit to the systemic problems, they prefer to waste the customer's time, adding to the frustration.  If they can iron out the glitches, then the device is worth consideration.  But for now, stay away.

I'm just one day in, so these are only preliminary impressions.TL;DR: I am extremely happy with the Quest except for its propensity to stop tracking the left touch controller; unknown if this is an isolated problem.I will update this review when I have a resolution. (EDIT: May 29, See below)Comfort: the headset fits securely once you get the hang of adjusting the straps (it's only three pieces of velcro, but it takes some actual fiddling to get it right the first few times). The sweet spot for the lenses is small, so getting the thing aligned with your eyeballs without putting too much pressure on your face/back of your head is key to a good experience. There is also a welcome simple adjustment for inter-ocular distance. Speakings of eyes, as a glasses wearer, there are extra complications. The Quest comes with a glasses spacer (which is great) to give more depth inside the headset, but my trouble came with my glasses' *width*--they just won't fit inside. I am (mostly) near-sighted with a few old-guy vision issues, so it's not the end of the world, but would be better with narrower frames (or custom prescription lenses for the Quest, which is an after-market option!)Build Quality: The unit feels like a premium piece of gear. No complaints with fit, finish or packaging. Seems to be both sturdy and attractive with an understated aesthetic.Immersion: I have only had a few other limited VR experiences (some dating back to the first wave of VR in the 90s; Terrordactyl, anyone?) but I was extremely impressed with the in-VR experience. The ""First Steps"" and ""First Contact"" tutorials are both great in their own way, with ""Steps"" having more complete tutorialization and and ""Contact"" being much more visually satisfying (and more fun!) it's just a little weird that there is so much overlap in content between the two...anyhow, the ability to grasp, point, smack and otherwise manipulate immaterial objects came surprisingly easily. The Touch controllers became second-nature for me in a matter of minutes (I think my daughter's adjustment time was measured in seconds). The sense of scale and motion is excellent, and the ability to walk around in a larger play space is amazing. The six-degrees-of-freedom is a big advantage over the Quest's little brother Go. The Art direction, sound and UI design in the provided experiences is top-notch and feels highly polished.Visuals: Definitely a compromise when compared to PC-tethered alternatives--just compare in-game screenshots for Beat Saber and Robo Recall for a reference. The screen-door of the pixel grid is present, but not overwhelming. Dark scenes seem a little smudgey, as if there is not enough dynamic range. For me, all of this is worth the freedom to take and use the unit anywhere there is clear floor space. 1337 Ga/\/\0Rs will probably turn up their noses, but I think it's more than a fair trade-off.And the one glaring problem: My left controller loses tracking with the headset with a distressing regularity. Sometimes, every few minutes. Very occasionally the right one as well. This completely breaks immersion and makes Beat Saber an exercise in extreme frustration. The problem is can be rectified by removing and replacing the AA battery in the controller (I have come to greatly appreciate the magnetic battery door latch), but soon recurs.I have no idea if I got a defective unit or if this will turn out to be a widespread problem. I have put in a trouble ticket with Oculus for this, so we'll see what happens and I will update the review here when I hear.One star off for now.EDIT: My tracking issues turned out to be environmental; the Quest seems to hate to have sunlight (especially changing sunlight) and other IR sources in view. This can be exacerbated by having reflective surfaces in the play area.A combination of granite counter tops in the open kitchen, lots of framed prints, a slightly shiny floor and sun spilling in through the blinds seems to be my particular problem. Support at Oculus via email was great.Would be nice if I could play in the living room, but I will have to find an alternate space.

Battery doesn't last long for 1 thing. Might not even last the length of a movie.  Also, after unplugging it from charger and letting it sit, it'll be dead in a few days. Not even in use during that time. Watching it more closely now. I may have to return it.Screen tear popping up now and then, on games, movies, pretty much anytime anywhere. Was it released too soon?

Coming from a Rift, I'm very impressed with Quest.  CONS: I definetly feel all of the weight in the front and I find it to be not too comfortable after a while. The sound that comes out sounds very spatial and natural, but the volume is too low and bass notes sound terrible and distorted. Instead I'm using headphones with a 6"" coiled cable for a much better experience.  The tracking is not as good as Rift, you do lose position of hands if they are beside or behind you, but you get used to that quickly.PROS: The screens look great, a noticeable improvement from Rift with less ""screen door effect"". The new lenses also have ""God rays"" but they are not as noticeable. The quality of visuals the custom snapdragon 835 in this headset is able to output is amazing. ""Vader Immortal"" stands out, you can tell they took full advantage and optimized for this game for this headset because this game looks as good as any Rift game somehow, no $1000 pc required, and this gets me excited about future titles. The fact that there's no wire attached is also a big plus, you can get as fancy as you want with your movements. Battery life seems to be around 2 hours playing games and everything just feels high quality. What this device gives you for $400 is incredible.

I got mine in the mail a little early (two days before release date) and was extremely happy to set it up.The setup was easy, taking me only about 5 minutes to set up the headset, and the controllers. Setting up room-scale tracking was extremely easy as well, not having to screw base stations into the wall or place sensors any where made it a breeze. The one thing that amazed me right out of the box was how I could make a play area larger than ever before, and walk around flawlessly with no tracking errors, dodging couches, chairs, and walls due to Oculus Guardian.The next part that amazed me was the responsiveness of the controllers paired with the quality of the screen. While games have lower graphics than PC powered graphics, everything was still great and no motion sickness with the 70 hz refresh rate. I love the form factor and set up of the Oculus controllers; the controllers are 10 times better than that of the HTC VIVE (until Index VR Controllers are released). Starting up the first game I bought, SuperHOT VR (a must buy for anyone just starting VR or wanting to play a fun game that never gets boring), and it ran flawlessly. I originally had an HTC VIVE and sold it for the portability of the Quest, and I could not tell the difference in graphics in SuperHOT (I could notice it with some games but most games ran like a dream). Playing games truly wireless is a godsend, I felt that it was exactly what we need to bring VR to the masses. People possibly wonder however, what about the SteamVR games for previous VIVE or Oculus owners, well luckily to a website called RiftCat, you can stream SteamVR titles using PC graphics to the Quest with a stable Wi-Fi connection.My friends and I when using the VIVE would rate a game's immersive-ness by seeing how well we know where we are oriented before taking off the VIVE, and if we could not notice the orientation, it would be deemed as an immersive title. Very few games achieved that (Rec Room, Raw Data, Arizona Sunshine, and sometimes TheLab). But now, with the use of no wires, being completely free in a VR world, almost every game we try on the Quest is immersive (one time I took it off and started from the couch all the way to the microwave, which is about 20 ft of walking). Almost every time before I take off the headset, I have had no idea what way I am facing/rotated in my room.The next thing which I appreciate is the integrated speakers. While there is a headphone jack, including speakers instead of headphones adds a nice touch where everything still feels immersive but giving us enough of a presence in our surroundings (when a friend tells us something while playing we can hear it, or when dogs are barking, someone is knocking on the door, all can be successfully heard).The next thing that I like is the head-strap. The head-strap is extremely adjustable making it easy to slip on and off when switching between players. And the other nice touch is that there is a slight elasticity to the strap where when you pull on it, it expands and contracts, meaning when I take it off, the strap lengthens (without feeling tighter) and when I put it bag on it tightens to a nice snug fit.One might wonder about being with other people and whether or not they can see what you are doing, but luckily they added the option to Cast the player's view onto a TV using Google Chromecast. This works, but is still in beta so it sometimes causes a little bit of throttling/motion sickness.With everything I love, there are two things I would have liked to see added to the Quest:First: the option to plug a long cable from the Quest to the PC, allowing PC graphics to be played on the Quest, when you are home but still having the standalone option for traveling. While RiftCat is an option, fast Wi-Fi is not always an option to everyone.Second: updating the SOC to a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 with the Adreno 640 GPU, improving the graphics by up to around 40% and improving the speed and power efficiency at the same time. Hopefully they continue to update the chipset every year with the latest and greatest Snapdragon Processor and Adreno GPU.Overall, for the amazing price, portability, tracking, gameplay and immersiveness, the Oculus Quest is an amazing device that I would highly recommend getting. I love this so much that I am pretty sure this is the longest review I have written-that is how much I love this product.

I wanted to have the Oculus Quest for about a month before I left a review.  I figured this would give me time to really get to know the headset.  There's tons of other reviews out there so there was no rush to get mine up.I will get to the review later, but for now I have to share something that some folks might not know that may be a deal breaker for them.The Oculus headsets do not support cloud saves.  So any progress you make in a game on your Oculus Quest is attached to that headset.  If something happens to it, there goes all your progress.Yesterday due to the recent update, I was having issues with my right controller, like many others.  Tech Support Brandon had me do a factory reset without bothering to mention that in doing so, I would lose all my saved progress on all of my games.  What current console doesn't support cloud saves? Heck, even the Switch got on board with that!This is a deal breaker for me and I will likely send the headset back.I'll get to the larger review when I'm not so angry.  I just wanted to let folks know about the absence of cloud saving before they buy.

This is the real deal! Best VR experience I have yet tried (used Vive and Gear VR before). Perfect hand control tracking and much better visuals than expected giving the 2 year old mobile processor.  Vader Immortal is an experience that every fan of Star Wars has to try at least once. Better than Star Tours at Disney.  Freedom of movement is the killer feature here and it doesn't dissapoint by giving you walking and rotating freedom.  Screen Door Effect is greatly reduced and only a problem when watching video. Pixels are very small, better than Gear VR on the Galaxy S10 which is already better than most. Guardian boundary system is incredible and makes it safe for everybody anywhere. I got goosebumps and felt scared a few times from heights and dangers. Very convincing and realistic. Creed is a crazy good experience even with all it's flaws, be sure to raise your gloves and look up. ;-)Why 4 stars instead of 5?  Headset is too front heavy and starts to hurt your cheek bones and nose bridge after 10min.  They need to get the second iteration of these electronics to be attached at a belt or other tyoe of clip with a small video and power wire that is unobtrusive to a screen only headset that is lite. Very few titles at launch with so many missing like Google Maps VR and any sort of travel panorama app. They should come in due time.  Titles are too expensive for the most part, Beat Saber for $29 ... really? They need to get into the $10 area.  Games are quite short in duration and they are as expensive as hundred hour games on PC.  Battery life is ok about 2hrs 10min on 3D games but expect to use a power pack to enjoy it better. Audio is ok but you should use real headphones, also everyone around you can hear your game which is annoying. Tracking needs light in room to work. Seems it is not IR  which would have been ideal. No way to use it in the dark unless you de activate guardian mode which is not recommended in developer mode.Can't wait to see more titles and apps at better prices too, this is an incredible product and experience. I have seen the future of entertainment and it started this month with the Oculus Quest!!! By version 3 in a few years it will probably replace most consoles and TVs. For a version 1 product, I was blown away! Full body and feet tracking/feedback is coming, what an exciting time to be alive!

***UPDATE***As of late 2021 this Unit is now the Red-headed Stepchild to the Kingdom of Occulus.  Once recognized as a practical gateway to VR...It was ever so quickly replaced by it's Little 'BIG' Brother Occulus Quest 2, which currently reigns supreme.  There is no need to buy a Quest 1, it is simply inferior.  I took 1 star away from my review due to the 'OBSOLETE' factor with Quest 1.  it was Quickly replaced by Quest 2, in fact of the best optimized games are 'EXCLUSIVE' to Quest 2, making it pointless to even consider purchasing a Quest 1.  that is all.I'm going about this review in a different fashion as i'm going to compare 3 different VR experiences I've had with Modern Day VR.First I will say that I am really liking everything about this VR unit...I have only played for 1 or 2 hours at this point but it's not my 1st Rodeo with VR, so to speak.  I have my own WMR (Mixed Reality) headset by Acer that is hooked up to my PC.  I also have played PSVR on a base level PS4.Most of my experience comes from many hours of fun on the Acer unit.  here's my summary viewpoint on each of these just so that it gives you an idea of product comparisons...Acer WMR Unit - In my opinion it has the edge on graphics.  Decent tracking but requires excellent light source to function properly and consistently, otherwise the tracking drops.  Constant framerate drops and seems glitchy with higher end titles.  Hardware doesn't require much in wires, much less than PSVR, but more cables than Quest.Hardware is the most inferior in design and quality.  forehead buffer has been know to actually disconnect from Headset completely if it's sitting idle!  bad adhesive I guess??  also feels light and cheap.  Only real positive is the unit flips up by the eye/forehead section, so you can take a quick break without removing the entire unit off your head.  This is awesome for adult beverage consumption, among other nefarious activity choices.PSVR - Not a lot of experience with this but the graphics are good, not great.  I only played with a base level PS4, not a PRO.  Lots of cables which is a negative, but the quality of the hardware is a solid design, not cheap.  well built to last and is comfortable.  Has the best Library of software, although no access to Steam.  This is basically not a portable unit, it's supposed to, meant to, remain stationary next to your PS4.  It's my least favorite of the 3 VR unit styles.Occulus Quest - 2nd best graphics of the 3 units I'm comparing.  This unit is the most comfortable, although a tad heavier than I would like.  Paddles are nice but I wish they were just a bit longer.Hardware portability and ease of use is so much the key with the Quest.  it's so convenient and for that alone it will probably be a major focal point with Marketing & Sales.  I can see this product doing very well for a long duration of time especially if they continue to add content.There are no wires!  except a charge cable.  so awesome.  the tracking is also the best i've seen out of the 3 units, best by a longshot too.Software wise it seems easy as 1-2-3.  Buy something on your smartphone app or in the headset software portal then just download and boom!  you're ready to rock.In short, the Occulus Quest is going to be my favorite of the 3 unit experiences...EVENTUALLY.  I know it will.  Right now it's in the 'infancy' stage, brand spankin' new as of this review i'm writing.  I can tell once it gets a massive library of game titles and other apps it will be much better.  I also look forward to seeing some firmware updates in the future to make this unit even better.The negatives I see right now are the lack of content, which is common for any launch VR or game system so whatever.  not going to knock it down a peg or 2 because of that.The sound, it lacks volume.  Would recommend headphones even just ear buds, this REALLY HELPS.  The sound however is very very clear.The graphics are probably a 7.5 out of 10.  so a bit of a let down but not a deal breaker either.  I'm wondering if this is something that can be improved upon over time?  maybe not.Not much in the realm of Cons so far.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is just getting into owning their first VR headset, as well as someone who travels a lot.  The Quest is basically grab-n-Go if you want it to be.i'm looking forward to diving into it some more but so far I'm really impressed.

I own the Rift and Vive VR headsets and I bought this for something to travel with and bring over to friends houses to play VR games like Beat Saber and cast them to the TV for everyone to enjoy.The setup is really easy. Drawing your guardian boundaries works better on this device than any other VR setup I've used.The device comes out of the box with a strong odor that has dissipated a little but hasn't gone away completely. I assume it will with time.The device has the ability to cast what you see to a supported Chromecast device, but many titles including Beat Saber and Vader Immortal don't allow you to, so its a pretty pointless feature for me. Also, it doesn't cast audio at all. It's video only. This feature has been shown with Beat Saber in pre-release videos so I was really surprised it didn't work.I get a lot of artifacts when playing games or using the Netflix app. Flickers of white dots and lines keep me from any sense of immersion. I haven't seen this issue reported anywhere else online, so it may just be a defect in my device.Having to buy all of these games again is a pain as well. A few games support cross-buy if you purchased them in the Oculus store, but most of mine were purchased on Steam so I have to re-buy every game that I want to play.Overall its impressive that Oculus was able to do everything they're doing with the hardware inside the Quest but without audio/video casting working in all games, it's not useful to me.

This is my first VR system, so I can't compare it with Rift, but this is one of the most amazing things I've ever experienced. You completely feel like you're part of whatever environment you're in. When I accidentally drop a ping pong ball in Racket Fury, I instinctively try to catch it with my foot. When I'm getting ready to fight the somewhat cartoonish boxers in Creed, I get an adrenaline rush because my brain is telling me I'm going to get my *ss kicked. Even the simple ability to put yourself inside Google Maps with Wander, or to watch a Netflix movie on a giant screen in a huge mountain retreat -- it's unreal. I can't wait to see where this will go in future iterations.If there are any cons for me, it's that the headset can get pretty uncomfortable after a while, and the battery life isn't amazing--you get roughly two hours before you have to charge it again. Also, I wish it wasn't owned by the evil empire, Facebook.All that being said, I would buy this again in a heartbeat.EDIT: The physical volume button stopped working a couple days in, although I could still change it from the settings menu. Then a couple days later, I was playing a game when it all of a sudden shut down and went to a menu screen and wouldn't let me select anything. None of the buttons did anything. I couldn't even power it off or do a factory reset. It's now inoperable. I submitted a service request a couple days ago and haven't heard anything so far. We'll see how the return/replacement process goes...

I have owned a Oculus Rift for a few years now, which I really loved at the time.Over time I found that I would rarely actually use it, as it took quite an effort to set everything up (3 sensors).Being a Mac user, this came with additional issues, as Apple somehow refuses to provide some potent GPU's or a reasonable GPU upgrade path. So I found myself using a Windows machine each time I wanted to play (with nVidia 1060).  It has always been an impressive experience though.Last week I did get myself the Oculus Quest, and boy did a world of fun open for me.No more setup, no PC needed with beefy GPU, no annoying wires.Just take the headset, put it on, and you're good to go!When I received the Quest, it took about 10 minutes to get started for the first time (including unboxing), and in the passed days I have found myself using the Quest frequently.-> Note for Oculus: add a page to your quickstart guide, showing what button does what and showing how to power off the device properly, would have been good.The best part is definitely that the entire exercise of ""getting started"" has been cut down to almost zero time.Just take the headset, put it on, verify the guardian, and you're good to go. This was definitely not the case with the Rift.Speaking of the Guardian; it seems to remember earlier settings, which is nice when you're playing on the same spot again in the future. Being able to see your surroundings while setting the Guardian is awesome!  Something I missed with the original Rift.Since the headset includes an Android device and a battery pack, it is, understandably, a little heavier, but I have to say that I didn't notice this while using it.On that note: the headset has significantly improved for those wearing glasses. A special insert will provide a little bit more room.The controllers are different than the ones that come with the Rift as well, and I'd say they are an improvement as well.The battery gives me quite a bit of play time (about 2 hours), and if needed one can charge while playing (charger or Powerbank - it seems the USB-c charger/Powerbank should at least support 5V/2.6A). I haven't had a need for that, because after 2 hours of playing, it's nice to take a little break anyway.Charging the headset is relatively fast, it seems the provided charger is 18W, so maybe a beefier charger will do things quicker. I haven't tested that yet.As one can imagine, the graphics (details) are not as great as the Rift (lack of beefy GPU). Games like ""Robo Recall"" play very smooth, but the textures are of a much lower, but acceptable, quality. The quality is enough to have a very smooth and acceptable experience. Having said that; the picture is very clear and seems a little better than the Rift, but not by much. The headset does seem to fit better though than the Rift.The sound was actually a surprise. Where with the Rift one had little speakers over the ear, the Quest seems to have ""nothing"" yet the sound is surprisingly good. An optional headset/earbuds can be used, but I haven't had a need for it yet.Linking the Quest to my XBox One controller worked off the bat as well, which I needed since I wanted to sideload Half-Life and Quake (sidequest - sidequestvr.com). Obviously, the old Half Life and Quake games are very low-res, but it was a fun experience anyway as you can move around more freely (compared to ""Robo Recall"" where you have to jump from one location to the other).One cool thing Oculus did as well, is that when a title is available for the Rift and the Quest, your previously bought games will be available on the Quest as well (eg. Robo Recall).Another cool thing is the Oculus Quest for your smartphone. It not only gives you easy access to all kinds of settings, the store, your library etc, but ... it also allows you to view what the player is viewing or even cast the video feed to ChromeCast. This is great when wanting to follow a player or when wanting to help out those new to the VR experience.Now one downside is that the game selection is, at this moment, still a little limited.SideQuest adds a few extras, but it is not for everybody.Some games of the Rift are re-done for the Quest (Robo Recall for example), and some have a ""version 2"" for the Quest. For example the super cool demo ""Face your Fears"" (Rift) is available for the Quest as ""Face your Fears 2"" - unfortunately though, it's not even close to the original. It's a completely different ""game"".This actually bummed me out a little, since I used ""Face your Fears"" to show new VR users the cool immersive feeling when using a VR (it's awesome!). The new version is not anywhere close to that experience and has no resemblance with the previous version whatsoever.-> So to the maker of ""Face your Fears"" - please redo the original for the Oculus Quest as well!A few accessories one could consider buying;1. A hardshell case.I got this one, which first perfect and even holds charger and my XBox One controller: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WCRS6D4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=tweaki-20&linkId=e269d682b3f9a6abf75cce49062b1d1c&language=en_US2. Optionally a lens protector - a little insert to make sure direct sunlight doesn't hit the lenses, and to prevent scratches when the Quest is stored. Still looking for this, and for now I use the little cardboard insert that came with the Quest.3. Some kind of hygienic wipes/masks/etc to prevent shearing sweat ;-)I'm still looking for something that would do the trick.4. A powerbank, if you want to remain untethered while playing with a drained battery.All-in-all, I'd highly recommend the Oculus Quest, and I'm curious what Oculus will do with the next generation.If you ever decide to sell the Quest, you'd find a buyer much easier, as there are no additional requirements (like with the Rift) for the potential buyer.

I was on very excited to receive my oculus quest on release day.  I was sad to see that I received a faulty headset that had dried glue over the inside of the lens that needless to say makes the experience less than pleasant and blurry.  I have been in contact with ouculus support for nearly a week and no one seems to be able to get me an answer or replace my 400dollar system.  You can see what I'm talking about in this video.

 First of all, this is better than any other VR headset I have tried and that has a lot to do with the wireless nature of it. The biggest drawback here is that some games at some points gets very pixelated since this system is not very powerful. It is also a bit heavy so if your head is small... this will feel incredibly heavy and uncomfortable. I have attached a video showcasing what you get in the box and what the setup process is like. If you plan on getting this... do download the Oculus app on your mobile phone and create a Oculus account so you can skip that step when you get the headset!

So first impressions. Got my Quest delivered this morning, and the setup was crazy easy. You install an app on your phone, pop it out of the box, and are basically good to go.There are about 5 demos to check out as well as a basic tutorial about how the controllers work. I do recommend that you have at least 12’ by 12’ to work with for your play area. Installed Vader Immortal and Beat Saber... both of which are AAA releases and are sufficiently badass! Can’t wait to try more games in the next few days.Overall the wireless setup, decent graphics(with a bit of “screen door” effect) and 6 degrees of movement without separate sensors make this tech toy very exciting and great to bust out to impress friends. It’s not cheap, but if you have the money and want to get your mind blown I can’t help but recommend it.

Wow! Just wow! I’ve wanted to love VR for awhile now. Started with Google Cardboard. Tried the Gear VR when I had a Samsung phone. Even bought a PS VR for my PS4. That one was definitely a step above the first two but I just never used it much. Last year I bought the Oculus Go thinking being untethered to a TV might be what I want. It’s collecting dust as well.The Quest? Can’t stop using it. I now realize it’s not so much the untethered nature that’s attractive, but the 6DOF and camera enhanced camera tracking.Yes, the graphics of this are better than the Go. Yes, I realize the graphics on a Rift S or Vive would be better, but I was never going to invest all that money into a gaming PC, I’m far too casual a user. That said, this is so immersive, it’s mesmerizing.Being able to draw out the dimensions of the room you’re in helps. You can literally walk around after doing so. If you get a bit too close to the edge, a virtual wall begins to appear to prevent you from walking into the real wall. The other thing that makes it a winner is the camera tracking and controllers. Being able to have the game recognize you leaning, or ducking is key, being able to grasp objects with your VR hands, having an articulating couple of fingers (not ten, but a couple) really changes the game.It’s still a gimmick for video playing, I downloaded a 3D movie, plus have tried things like the Netflix app and the Prime Video app. They’re fun for a bit, but the video quality/resolution just isn’t there yet. But for playing games (even casual ones like the addicting Poker game that’s free) - let’s just say if you’re like me (a casual gamer) this is probably the device to own right now.

A hardware platform is only as strong as the software available on it. There is a dismal amount of content on the platform, similar to the apps available on a first generation iphone. The hardware itself is amazing, but their ""walled garden"" approach means that the software will always be mediocre at best. The tech is ALMOST there, give it one more generation and we'll have a VR headset that isn't this walled garden nonsense!

My family and friends have loved this. Are the graphics bleeding edge? No. Does it boast a huge battery life? No.But! It does have great graphics and a few hours of battery life. It does allow you the freedom to be cable free and a view into the expanding VR market. All without having to invest in a costly PC system. To be honest, I mainly use this in short bursts and place it back on the charger. Or, I just use the VERY long charger cable while I play more intensive games, like Pavlov. Be sure to look into SideQuest so you can side load apps.Very happy to see where VR is headed. I will say this, this unit is very overpriced for the hardware, but I get it. It's still sort of Niche and new, so they can charge more. My only concern is the cheap controllers and how easily you can mistakenly remove the battery covers (most noticeable while playing tennis style games).I feel for the price, they could have either added a better battery compartment, Sleeves, Controller housing material.So far the little bugs are not really worth mentioning besides the device dropping wifi in clear view of the router (on multiple networks under low load). But, I would say the Price for sure. Had my roommate not agreed to pay half, I would not have owned this.If anything changes or after mid / long term use proves other faults to be an issue, I will update this review. For now, I am leaving this at 5 stars.

I've owned other VR headsets (Vive and Oculus Go) and loved them both. For this reason my expectations for Quest were modest. How well could a mobile chipset handle not just gaming, but wireless gaming in 6DOF and tracking two controllers? I hoped for the best but expected to be mildly disappointed. Well, the Quest did not meet my expectations, it FAR EXCEEDED them! This is somehow a BETTER experience than I had in VR powered by a full fledged gaming PC. Visuals are great, no wires to worry about tripping over, tracking is PERFECT, and the convenience is too good to be true. Haven't been so impressed by a new product since the original iPhone. This is a game changer.

Where do I start? It came earlier than anticipated and the box was sealed, the product appeared to be in new condition, I say that because some people have reported getting used equipment or missing equipment, not so in this purchase. I charged it and put the batteries into the hand held controls and I loved that the doors of the devices were magnetic, they slid right into place and stayed! So far, we have played hours with the batteries that came with it, but I would suggest purchasing double A batteries, either Duracell or a brand name, I have actually thought about purchasing nicad rechargeable batteries. The games are so realistic, zero gravity will make you feel like you are floating and when you play the Darth Vader game, hold on to yoru socks, if you love Star Wars, you will absolutely love this game!  I swear, the reality of this is incredible.  Now the CONS. The head set isn't very stable, it feels like it might fall off when you are wearing it and it isn't very comfortable for long periods of time. The place where your nose fits has a crack that allows light to come in, often times making the experience not so great. ( I am going to use some foam to block that out) The straps seem flimsy and cheap, I am going to modify this headset, so it will work better, I might even use the straps from an older version of a VR set I have that has more padding and comfort. I will see. The fitting of the head piece is a challenge, because if you don't get it just right, the field of view can seem blurry in places, leading you to think the lenses need cleaning, when they don't. The weight of the helmet isn't that bad, I didn't feel like it was too heavy or bulky, I didn't think it distracted at all the experience. Again, I want to redesign the straps, and the foam, perhaps making it more secure and comfortable. Now don't get me wrong, it isn't that bad that I want to send it back, this is definitely a keeper! Now the games I found were a bit elementary, with the exception of the first person shooter games. I thought that the graphics seemed rudiment and elementary and would appeal more to those who are under the age of 13. I did find that the Vader game is the best, although the Seals type game I want but at 30 bucks, Ill wait a while. There are many free games and you can demo a lot of the games before purchasing them, and this is something I really liked. When you purchase a game, you can play it less than two hours and if you don't like it, you can request a refund, something I have never heard of before, but my 12 year old son told me about it, after he purchased plank and felt it wasn't what he wanted. Saber game is a great one to, its fun and you definatley get a workout! I love to fly, so I would love a real flying style game, I hope that eventually the makers will develop one. There is another game that is about climbing and it looks like a lot of fun. I think there are enough games out there to justify purchasing this head set. I loved that you aren't tethered either! This gives you a lot of freedom when playing games. Now about the reality of the Virtual reality. At times, I find that my mind interprets the environment as so real, I want to walk about and explore this world, it is so real, at times, my heart beats faster, because my brain has interpreted the environment as reality! I am so excited about this headset, I can only hope that as time goes on, they will develop more games, like Sony Play Station and X Box, but for now the Virtual world and the reality world they offer is incredible. I haven't used it to do google explore, I am really looking forward to that, my daughter did and she said, Daddy, it was just like being there, I was at the Eiffel Tower! So out of vie stars, I would give it four, only because of the headset and the limited games, but a solid four! Would I buy it again? You bet your socks I would.

As a long time Vive owner (currently using a Vive Pro and original lighthouses) I was honestly *shocked* that the Oculus Quest worked as well as it did. Despite being 100% standalone and portable, the 6DoF tracking on this thing is almost indistinguishable from my Vive, despite not having a dedicated room with mounted lighthouse sensors. It smartly switches off when not in use and boots up in seconds when you're ready to hop into VR, allowing you to play VR sessions up to three hours or just smack notes in Beatsaber for five minutes with literally no friction.The thing also works everywhere - on my first day I set it up in a conference room, my garage, my living room, and my basement - and the tracking has malfunctioning (like, maybe a second or two to sync up) perhaps twice in four days of usage. Amazingly, the image inside the headset is even more clear than my OG Vive and on par with my Vive Pro (granted, it's running lower rez, but still) and the framerate is flawless in most every game I've tried.In short, the Quest does everything we were promised at a totally reasonable $400 price point. It's an incredible device, and the freedom to go completely wireless and play anywhere (so long as there's not a super bright light or mirrored surface) far outweighs the minor loss of graphical fidelity from not having a desktop setup. I'm not abandoning my desktop PC or Vive Pro (I still use those for modded Skyrim and other high-intensity games) but I can't imagine playing games like Beatsaber, Superhot, or similar experiences on anything but my quest. Wireless is key.If you've been wanting to get into high quality VR and have balked at the price of a desktop PC and new Rift/Vive/Microsoft HMD, just get the Oculus Quest. It's great. And if you already have a desktop PC setup, get a Quest anyway.  The portability of the Quest can't be matched, and I love that I can be in Beatsaber (or a similar app) in under 10 seconds flat whenever I have a few minutes to spare. The Quest is as close to a ""Ready Player One"" headset as you can get right now, and an exciting step forward for VR in general.

If this review were limited to just to playing the oculus itself I would give 5 stars.  It is super fun to play, has good games, and the multiplayer function is amazing.  I can play games with my friend across the country and it feels like he is actually in the room. You can even cast the screen up so everyone can see what you are playing and join along in the experience. And this is even considering we've been down a controller for half the time we've owned it (more on this below).BUT... you better hope and pray that nothing goes wrong and you don't have to interface with customer service.  Unfortunately the left controller that came with the system was malfunctioning out of the box.  It would work sometimes but would intermittently turn off or start jumping around/floating off into space.  I immediately went to the website which has a somewhat helpful troubleshooting section but none of the proposed solutions worked. I then contacted their customer service which quickly devolved into my worst customer service experience ever.The first thing is the only way to interface with customer service is via email/messaging- there is no phone call option.  Upon sending the message they quickly inform you that their response my take up to 2-3 business days. I will spare you the gory details, but essentially after suggesting all of the things that were already on the website and pretty clearly establishing there was something wrong with the controller, they said they would ""look into it further"" and get back to me in 3-5 business days.  It was only after emailing again to express my frustration that they responded that I did indeed need a new controller.  Essentially what could have been concluded after a 15 minute phone call took an entire week of back and forth emails.  Even worse was that every single message from the oculus support team was from a different person so I was dealing with a new person every time.The customer service then informed me that they would happy to send me a new controller AFTER I sent in the defective one and after 3-5 days of processing.  They provided a label for UPS Ground (AKA slow) and when I asked why they couldn't send a new controller once they were able to see I has shipped the defective one they said that they don't have control over the replacement process.I provided feedback via their requested link and they reached out to me to see if there was anything they could do. I expressed my displeasure about the fact that in total it will take me >3 weeks to get a new controller to replace the one that was defective out of the box and that the vast majority of the games are unplayable with one single controller.  I expected them to offer something helpful like a list of games that one can play with one controller and the response I got was (and I quote): ""I appreciate your frank feedback about our support system, and we are continually working to improve the customer experience. I'll be sure to share it with the team.""TL;DR- System and games are great and I would give it 5 stars.  However, the customer service was so bad I docked it two full stars.Should you have the misfortune of needing to interface with customer service get ready for a bumpy ride. We got a defective controller out of the box and it will take 3+ weeks to get a replacement and has caused a lot of headaches.UPDATE 10/7/20:Now my right controller has stopped working and I had to go through the same process again to get it replaced.  This time around they told me they will send a ""refurbished"" controller.  I asked to have the situation escalated to a supervisor given it was (what I hope) a rare occurrence of hardware failing twice, but was told it was not possible.  Now I'm in the process of waiting another 3 weeks to get my replacement controller and am unable to play most of the games.I'm changing my review now to 2 stars.  Again, love the gameplay, but you better hope nothing goes wrong.

Do me a favor and google ""oculus kickstarter"" and watch the 5 minute promo video. You'll see why I say 7 years in the title of this review. This is essentially the culmination of 7 years of hard work, from prototype, to version 1.0, to various iterations and eventually leading to the next gen: a VR experience for the general public. It is not the end all be all VR, meaning...the Quest is not supposed to represent the best VR has to offer, but more like...""the essentials"", or a fine balance of what you need to really get the A-ha moment, or to share this experience with those who are not in the loop. Honestly, even just a few minutes with the first demo experience is enough for anyone to really see - this is not just another gimmick device. It really is piece of technology that represents the next gen. Sort of like how when Steve Jobs first presented the iPhone, and said ""we are announcing three products..."" and the crowd all of a sudden got it, it all clicked. I feel that the Oculus Quest really brings that level of ""enlightenment"". It's quite special and even though it may seem like a high price tag...in fact it is only a small price to pay to really get that experience in your hands and those around you.

I love video games.  I also have a family and a demanding job.  My time for gaming is limited.  I already had the Playstation VR, so I am not new to VR.  This headset is amazing mainly because it is self contained and is wireless.  Some of the tethered VR headsets are going to be an improvement over this system graphically, but you are giving up the ease of use and freedom of a wireless experience.I keep the headset hidden in my entertainment center in the living room, there are no sensors, wires, etc that are left out.  Getting ready to play takes a couple of minutes and when you are done you put it right back.  You can take it on the road if you want to share the experience with a friend or on a business trip.  So far I have played beat saber, Vader Immortal, and Robo Recall.  I am very impressed with the experience given that this system is running off of a what is essentially a smart phone platform.  The graphics are pretty much PS3/XBOX 360 level of detail, but that really misses the point.  The immersion you feel in the middle of one of these games goes far beyond the graphical fidelity.  Think of this system in line with the Nintendo Wii.  The point is the interaction.  Not having wires attached to you if far more important in my opinion.The other key benefit of this system is it will expose non gamers to VR.  4-5 non gamers tried this out at my house last weekend and all of them were blown away.  Very similar to playing Wii bowling with your wife/girlfriend or mom/dad, its just easy to understand and very approachable.Having an uncluttered space to play is key.  Being on your feet and walking around through the virtual play space is the main benefit of a wireless system.  The system wants a 6.5 foot square to allow you to move around the room during play, but you can always go bigger.  You use one of the controllers to draw out the safe zone.  During game play you will see a mesh wall appear when you get close to the edge.  You can stick your head through the safe zone wall and the view will change to a black and white video feed of the room.  This is amazing, and really helpful if you hear a strange noise need to communicate with someone in your home.  The other feature I should mention is the headset has built in speakers.  This allows you the play games, but still hear ambient noise in the room.  If you have kids, its probably not a great idea to be blind and deaf at the same time.  You can plug in earbuds for a more immersive experience, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you are solo.I have found that VR is best in short chunks, like 15-30 minutes.  Most of the games feel more like arcade games and I think that is the right experience.  You are moving around and depending on the game it can be a pretty active experience.  Play a few rounds of Creed boxing, its not something you will likely want or be able to do for hours.  The ease of setup and wireless nature of the Quest is the ideal VR experience in my opinion regardless of cost.  Its less about the graphical horsepower and more about how you interact.  If you don't want to maintain a dedicated VR space and invest in a dedicated gaming PC, this is the way to go.  I can't wait to see the state of VR in 10-20 more years.  I think wireless is the new minimum standard after giving the Quest a test drive.  Good luck!

Perfect VR system for busy people

I'm a VR fan. I've tried many VR headsets. Phone, PSVR, HTC, and other Oculus headsets. I feel like I'm within the range to talk about this in depth.To start. The screen is very sharp. At least for current standards. You're not looking at real life obviously, but it gets the job done and the pixels are hardly noticeable. I cannot say the same for other headsets where the pixels are too noticeable and very distracting, however I feel like a theater experience when watching videos is a great trade-off for a bit more obvious pixels.That being said, the display and colors still look great, and I enjoy having vibrant colors when watching stuff or playing games. It is a good thing I notice far more than any pixels. It is just as good as all the TV's in my house and my iPad/iPhone, if not better in some aspects.When watching videos, it's definitely a thing you need to get into the habit for, as putting on the headset is a bit time consuming rather than just turning on a TV and sitting down. Until further improvements (which have been confirmed by Oculus to come in 2020 or sooner) are made for tracking, it is near impossible to watch videos at night, which discourages using it, because it needs to use the cameras and know where it is, and where the controllers are. This means keeping a light on, or having a really bright night light. The improvements Oculus are bringing for this issue will be astounding for other programs. The improvements include better tracking at night for controllers, and the ability to track hands so there is no need for controllers, which solves most issues and provides a true VR experience. Cannot wait for this. However until then, watching and playing at night or without any lights is impossible, so if you plan on doing that, wait a while; or don't! It's still fantastic.While I watch videos and movies and TV shows, the audio is great, the screen is great, and the feeling of a ginormous TV in front of you is great. However the best thing in my opinion is how comfortable it is.It's made of fabrics and soft straps, with no plastic pieces or heavy parts. It is still relatively heavy, but compared to other headsets, it's a dream. The weight balance is acceptable, and the straps are never uncomfortable. Watching stuff with this does not make my head hurt like the PSVR does, it's snug but not too snug.About the controllers, I like them. It took some time getting used to them, from other large controllers, but the responsiveness and little quirks about the controllers are wonderful. Just wish the straps wouldn't give out on me, they stopped tightening properly after about 2 months of regular use.The game selection is not very wide right now, but that's ok. The thing came out in May, and it has stuff like Beat Saber and SuperHot, so it's got the fun in those secured. However more quality titles are nowhere to be seen (yet!), and hopefully Oculus is able to bring big games like Minecraft VR, Skyrim VR, Borderlands VR, Etc. All over, because playing those on a PSVR or PCVR is not preferred after getting this headset, due to the fact that it's wireless.The wireless functionality has been the key factor for me. This thing is crazy cool and a humungous step in the right direction for VR. While the battery of the headset won't get you much playtime (2-3 hours, from experience) it sure does give me plenty of time to play wirelessly before plugging in the nonintrusive cable, trick for those wondering - play with the cord plugin into a wall behind you, and run the cord between your legs up to the headset, you won't even notice the charging cord there.As for the portability aspect. This is 1,000% better than anything else for letting friends and family try truly good VR without hauling a full PS4, or hauling a laptop (which most people don't use for VR, a desktop is smarter). I frequently bring this over to others and can hold the whole thing with one hand while carrying anything else I want in the other. I just use the original box it came in. Works fine for me! It's a great party trick, and not a one trick pony. People WILL ask you to bring this over when you visit, if they've tried it and liked it. People WILL ask when you'll bring it next. It doesn't get annoying, but it's funny! Seeing others try VR for the first time (and not garbage phone VR cases) with no wires, no limits, and with a good quality screen + good tracking, it is a wonderful way to pave the love of VR into everyone and get them hooked. I just wish there was a better way for everyone else to watch someone playing a game in VR. The current situation is having your friend put on the headset, with no custom headphones (using the built in speaker audio thingies) go to your phone, go to the Oculus app, and stream the Oculus view onto your phone. There is no audio (as far as I'm aware) transmitted to this cast, which is why I recommend the friend does not wear headphones, because the headset speakers themselves are the only way both the audience and player can hear what's going on. Not to mention the viewing for the audience is on a phone screen. You can cast your phone to a TV, but the lag from an internet connection, and high latency causing long delays onto a TV can make you feel like you're watching images of pixels with bad audio. There absolutely needs to be a revamped casting system for the quest, and I'm sad this is the best method!Unfortunately my first experience was with a phone VR case, and while I loved the concept of VR, it was a poor example for a first impression. I'm glad I stuck around for VR but not everyone is the same, this is a good way to get someone to try out VR and like it.Overall: There are some quirks and downsides. The battery isn't the best, more games could come out, nightime use can drastically improve, and the ability to cast properly are all things that I disliked or was not very happy about. However, the pros heavily outweigh the cons, and I am in no way going to get rid of this bad boy! It is a revolutionary product with many amazing features and a wonderful step for VR into the mainstream audience. If you're reading this and considering, absolutely do. It is worth every penny, especially since it's dirt cheap for the amount of use you'll be getting from it. I would do 9/10 but there are only 5 stars. So 4.5/5!

Recommended mods: Deluxe Audio Strap is an absolute must. -- No way around it.  It will hurt your neck and head if you don't install this mod.Mamut Grips (or similar) are also kind of a must -- they let you let go of the controllers, and they just become a part of your hands -- your fingers move in IRL, they move in game. -- You don't have to grip the controllers the whole time.Rechargeable controllers -- this is a nice to have -- but just search for rechargeable USB batteries and small mini-right angle connectors for them. -- You can dremel out a small hole in the battery cover, so that the wire can come out and down and out of the bottom of the mamut grips. -- Then you can just plug in your controllers and have them always charged.Tactical Airsoft Helmet Counterweight -- lots of people are using all sorts of things for counter weights, including batteries -- but this has worked well for me; just put some velcro on the back of the DAS, and stick one of these to it, and you're good to go.  The nice thing about the airsoft counterweights is that you can calibrate them by removing/adding the little metal lego bricks.  Mine has spots for 5 of them and I use between 2 and 3.There's lots more mods you can do but those are the best ones, IMO.FYI, you can play PCVR games wirelessly with this headset using programs like Riftcat or Virtual Desktop (this has been there since like the second or third week after launch, can't remember).

This is my second Oculus VR set I have owed.  First was the GO and now the QUEST.  I am not a gamer.  I have never owned a XBox or any other system.  I have had this unit for over a month and these are my comments.  I bought the quest so I could be free to move around and have a greater experience and the Quest does not fail.  I have had no issues with my unit remembering different lay outs.  Graphics are incredible, the sound is really good (although head phones are the way to go.  No bugs or lag times  to report when system starts.  The hand controllers are easy to use with several extra buttons for the system to grow into.  Better life on headset is about 2.5 hours.  Headset is a little awkward after the first hour, especially in the back, top.  I’m sure 3rd parties are working on this.  There are many games to choose from ranging from Free to $29.00.  There are moves, videos, porn, And games to choose from that will keep you busy..  5G speed will only make VR and AR more popular next yearI gave the quest 4 stars because the games are to expensive.  I was a little upset to find out my games purchased on GO could not be transferred over, or at least a discount given.  The headset awkward pressure points and battery life all add up to one less star.

Oculus Quest gets 4 out of 5 stars

I purchased this with the intention of eventually using it for PC VR purposes (once that feature was announced). The quest's ability to function independently from a PC but also having the capability to function as a PC VR headset was what led me to make the purchase. Looking at reviews, it would appear that unless you're a VR Snob, you'll likely not notice the difference. For the price, I'm not sure it could be beat right now.To be honest, though, so far I've not used the PC VR ability.So far, I've been mostly using it for fitness. I've purchased only two games so far: Pistol Whip and BoxVR. Pistol Whip, in a nutshell is a shooting game that acts as my leg day and BoxVR, is a boxing game that works my upper body. Running through just one of the games will generally give me a better workout than a 30 minute ride on a stationary bike. The game aspect allows me to work, without getting bored, for an hour or more if my endurance will allow. My best workout so far (according to my fitness tracker) burned nearly 1000 calories and peaked my heart rate at about 189 bpm. This is fantastic, especially if you live somewhere where inclement weather doesn't allow you to get outside for a run. Likewise, if you're like me and get bored working out, the game aspect keeps me engaged.I do not own any other headset to compare this to so I am unable to give you a solid comparison, other than knowing I'm able to run the games from the Oculus store and don't need to be plugged into a fairly expensive PC. You can take it anywhere. Show it to friends, show it off at a party, take it to work and get a workout in on your lunch break if you've got somewhere to use it (That's what I do).Protips:Buy a lenscover, they shouldn't be more expensive than 10 bucks.Buy a face cover of some sort. The stock one is generally fine to start unless you're using it for fitness and get sweaty easily (I do).If you squeeze the controllers too hard the battery cover might slide off. Buying a cover for them or some scotch tape will help.(I was able to buy all three of the above in a package on amazon for about 25 bucks)After owning it for about a week, I bought a case for it since I take it to and from work. It's not that I mishandle it, it's that a case costs about 25 bucks and the 64GB Quest was still expensive (for me). 25 extra bucks protects it. Harbor Freight carries an Apache Case listed for about that (With a coupon). The Quest and controllers will fit neatly inside it.There are a host of customization options for the Quest. Everything from decals for the front, aftermarket head straps... etc. All of them are pretty innovative and more seem to pop up every week.One complaint I've seen is that there are a lack of games (on the Oculus store) for the quest at the moment. However I would point out that the Quest has only been around about a year and with it constantly being sold out, it would show the demand for games is there. Likewise developers are scrambling to come up with new and exciting content, both for the Quest and for the PC VR market. I would also note that, at the moment, there are developer options that can allow you to access other features or in development games. I would also argue that since it can use the PC VR function, if you get a computer capable of supporting that feature, your game library access expands exponentially.If you have other questions about the Quest or are curious about what accessories are best, there are a host of Youtube personalities who have already been there. Lookup ""BMF"" or ""Eric For President"" or ""Virtual Reality Oasis"" or ""Cas and Chary VR"" since most of them have tried the accessories or games out and you can watch them show you what they're all about and tell you if they're actually worth the money. There are countless others too, the Apache Case I found from the youtube channel ""Tyco Tech.""In all: 5 Stars. It does exactly what I want and more. I'm very pleased with this product.

So first of all, I'm a big time video gamer so when I started hearing about the Quest I really, really wanted one. For my 50th birthday this year, I bought myself one. And well, let's just say I live in Virtual Reality now. Or at least I want to. I can't even describe how awesome this thing is. I wanted to check out the Internation Space Station app which is free and my god, it's so mindblowing. I live in a tiny hut in the Shire, so to be transported to space and to get to do space walks felt like I had escaped into wonder. I almost burst out, ""They should have sent a poet"" ala Jodie Foster in Contact, but I digress. The next thing I did was download Vader Immortal and, after playing though the game with fricken' Darth Vader right in front of me, I decided to spend some time in Vader's Dojo. Let's just say I'm there every night fighting with a lightsaber and getting a wee bit of cardio. Seriously, if you're a geek like me, this thing will change your life. Come to the Dark Side people!

I am not what you’d call a gamer. I have a PS4 and play video games w my kids. Bought this on a whim, and it is mind blowing. All my family and friends have tried it, and even the most skeptical among them have said “oh my GOD” after a few minutes. The system is so smooth, the controller tracking is flawless, and the games are great. My kids love it. I love it.I have only three gripes: 1) the battery life on some intense games is a little low. Sometimes dies after 2 hours. Believe me, it’s very easy to play this system for two hours straight. 2) most games only allow one player profile, so if you’re using the headset for multiple people in a household, you all have to basically share the same progress in every game. Sort of annoying. 3) controllers should be rechargeable. They eat about two AA batteries per week.That being said, I love this thing. I would buy it again and again. It’s easy to use, and it is like nothing else I’ve ever played. It is like you are actually inside the games you’re playing. We love the Star Wars game, Job Simulator, and Racket. But all the games we’ve bought have been awesome.Our PS4 has been almost totally idle since buying the oculus. First thing out of my kids’ mouths when they get home from school is “can we play the oculus?!?”

It took a few weeks to get this after ordering because it was backordered, but it was worth the wait. I've never had a VR system and I understand that this is not quite as technically advanced as something like the Rift; it has a lower-powered processor than the Rift, which from what I understand results in slightly lower resolution and processing speed, but so far I'm completely blown away! The headset is somewhat weighty, but with some adjustment I find it to be fairly comfortable. The controllers are responsive. The Guardian system that allows you to set play space boundaries so you don't bump into things is spot-on, though I wish there was a button to project it at any point, instead of having to get close to it for the barrier grid to show up on the screen. Casting to another device took a bit of work, as the instructions aren't exactly clear, but I got it working. A complaint there is that there is a distracting red dot that shows up in your field of vision to show that you're casting, but it's only slightly to the upper right of your vision; it could definitely be placed further out to it's less intrusive, or even having an option to disable it altogether. It seems that a number of folks have this opinion, and Oculus does have forums where you can suggest future upgrades to the devs.As to the game catalog, there are a number of fun and interesting titles, several of which I can tell greatly benefit from being untethered to a computer. It would be nice if there were more demos so you can try them out before buying; as of now there are only two or three, and a few more non-game experiences would be welcome, but the thing has only been out a few months so I suppose we should give it time. I'm definitely excited to see what games come out in the future, but so far there are some good titles available.One big question I had when considering which to buy was the memory: should I get the 64 or 128GB? I can tell you that I currently have 5 or 6 games and a few apps/experiences loaded, with a fair bit of room left over. And of course, as you complete games you can always delete and then reinstall them later, so I feel that spending the extra $100 for the extra GBs isn't really worth it; save that money to buy some games.In the end, I would say that if you're thinking about buying this or the Rift, you should consider if the lower resolution is a big factor (though I don't think it's that big of a difference, but I could be wrong since I've never used a Rift), and if you're OK being wired into a PC, reducing your range of motion. But if none of that matters to you and you're willing to plunk down $400 on a gaming system, buy this. Buy it now. You may have to wait for it to be in stock and delivered, but it's like being a kid waiting for Christmas again. I fully believe this is the future of VR gaming and will lead to further developments that will make VR more mainstream. I am extremely happy with my purchase, and highly recommend it!

Mixed feelings... won’t play with steam and you need to buy 3rd party streaming software to play games from pc.  It only plays “app” style games so if you Are wanting to steam you VR games you already own they will not work.  Even loading games you already own that can loaded onto the device requires the purchase of more 3rd party software.  It’s not very user friendly if you want to play games you have already bought and they oculus App Store doesn’t have a lot of quality games. Mainly B or C rated indie games. Also it does offer an almost open source web browser and fire fox but for an android based device not having a Google app in the store or available for download and having to download it though once again a 3rd party software is almost  laughable. It does have some great features like the tracking and not needing external sensors. The hardware is exactly what VR headsets need don’t get me wrong it’s great. they just need to focus more on software improvements. If it was compatible with mainstream gaming and didn’t require 2 different 3rd party software to stream and load it would have gotten 4 stars.

$400 is a lot of money for me. I bought it for 2 reasons - one is the health aspect and I have friends who are using it as their primary source for working out. The second and, equally important, reason I bought it is for meditation. When I heard there were meditation apps I was happy because I imagined meditating in all kinds of beautiful environments.I went to the Quest app store, only to find there are only 4 apps, ranging from $9.99 to $14.99. I tried one and liked it, but am disappointed in the limited selection. In fact, as I browsed the store, I was disappointed in the hefty prices for most apps. Free apps are limited...I only found16 in my search. After spending $400, I didn't count on having to spend so much on content.As for the headset, even with the eyeglass piece inserted, I found my lenses were not sitting in a way that gave me the sharpest viewing experience. (Just ordered new glasses, so this may be an issue just for me - we'll see.)So, overall, after the initial sticker shock, I see apps I would like to try but man, this is an expensive endeavor. After all of that expense, I expected a lot of free content and I am just not seeing it.Now I have learned there is another way to get apps called SideQuest, which means downloading APK files on the web, transfer them to the Oculus Quest, install them, then launch the app without using the Oculus Library. Ummm, ok.Additionally, I find the headset to be cumbersome and heavy. I used it sitting in bed for the meditation app, but still need to try it for active exercise. A lot to learn and figure out, but not sure this is something I can afford in the long run. Disappointing.

Being Oculus customer service is so horrible contcting them is useless a week and no reply, the unit I got died the first use, I have a temp reader and it read 115F. Now I am not technician at Oculus but that is not healthy for anything to have near the eye. I was trying to setup the unit it was on 15min but would not finish the setup, I thought it was hot in my house and took the headset off to amazingly hot, over hot Crap its hot unit.  Oculus has zero support so boxed the piece of junk and sent it back, if you have similar issues. Return it, these are not safe if they can get that hot.Hard to rate anything else since it was defective and nearly burned to the touch.Just found out its not compatble with Steam?? Wow.Oculus Seller, please do not comment to contact you as you do not help, only send generic answers forcing a return. So unless you are going to send me a free unit for my trouble, I wont be using Oculus products again, the GO over heated and so does the Quest.

Cant wait to play Arizona sunshine and death lap! Facebook horizon looks good to! After i purchased my Quest a week later my brother got one! If you see any complaints its usually gamers who have a gaming pc and have known about vr and have a certain standard. Or people looking at quest as underpowered and little content. Well its BRAND NEW and is gonna be walking before it sprints! I can tell you the content comes quickly! Had only a handfull of games and now the library will be hit with great games in december we are seeing many! So. If you want to experience wireless VR games. And dont have a PC, or just want it wireless. Its the Headset/console to get. Plus it has LINK so you can plug into PC at any time if you have it. Join us Questers! And know the popular VR gameplay you have been Binge watching on youtube! We have a very active facebook group just look up ARNOOKIE and other Oculus quest community-based pages! This is Cody blaze K. if anyone from our group recognizes throw a thumbs up so the new people can see! Can't wait for the new comers that we need to make our VR games great!

Really wanted to like the quest. So many glowing reviews. The convenience compared to prior generation VR setups is game-changing.But they quest couldn't figure out where my floor was, so I had to put big QR codes all over the room with masking tape so the quest could ""see"" my floor. Ugh.And then, great, tracking seems to work, ish. What games does it come with? None? Wait, what? Ugh.Well, let's look into my oculus account and download my prior purchased games...Wait, *none* of my purchases work on the quest? I have to buy everything all over again? Ugh.Let's try the space pirate trainer demo. Ok, neat, but lag spikes make for nausea. And I can't put my hands behind or below me, as my controller disappears.

I have both  - original rift and quest. So I'm comparing it to the rift only.Cons:1. Quest is very uncomfortable, it's impossible to wear it for more than 30 min, it's heavy and all the weight goes to your face! I do not have such problem with rift at all.2. VR sickness, it's much worse than with a rift. I don't know the reason, may be inaccurate tracking or low refresh rate 72Hz. Rift has 90Hz.3. Image quality, frankly I don't see any huge improvement over rift. Yes, it's better but not even x2 times better.4. Audio - garbage.Pros:1. Inside-out tracking, this is a pretty cool feature, but I doubt they will get a high precision tracking with it, it involves image recognition which is computationally expensive and inaccurate, unlike simple lighthouse tracking which used by vive and valve headsets. I know, it's portable but cmon, 99% of its users are using it in the same places.2. Oculus link, allows you to play games from SteamVR and Oculus Rift.I wish Carmack and his engineering team come up with better ergonomics, lighthouse tracking and minimum 90Hz refresh rate.

I bought the Rift S instead of this at launch day, preordered. I was on the fence between both units... I returned the rift S. It was terrible!!!! I waited to buy the Quest afterwards actually it was so bad. Until I heard about the Oculus Link technology and witnessed first hand ALVR running PC VR on a Quest.... Bought one, I love it, Best thing ever!!!!!  Adding hand tracking soon along with the Link make this a no brainer!  The Rift S is dead!  This becomes a Rift Q with a good USB 3.0 cable. or wireless with ALVR like I said. One pro tip I can give you all though. instead of connecting to your local wifi network. buy a good USB 3.0 wifi dongle. and then create a hotspot network in windows withit. Conect to your hotspot via the quest and make sure your PC is wired to your network instead of wireless. but that last part is not a big deal with this method actually. But doing this will remove any network latency or traffic from your wifi. Simply go into your hardware settings for your wifi card and manually set it to 40 mhz and to only use 802.11 a/n/c or any combo of those otherwise the hotspot will default to b/g mode which you don't want. If you do this you can play ALVR wireless PC VR no problem! It's literally amazing!!!!! don't listen to the other methods. do it this way.

Purchased for our daughter for Christmas 2019.  I thought since this was a Facebook company, the quality would be good.  My daughter likes the game.  Unfortunately, after five months of usage,  the right controller stopped working.  (my daughter does not play on the game everyday - the failure is not from excessive use).I googled support and found this issue has happened to quite a few people.  There are entire reddit threads dedicated to this issue.  We followed the suggestions and still could not get it to work.  We tried everything from changing batteries to resetting the device.Finally we contacted Oculus support and they opened a ticket. They said it appears we have tried all of the suggested repair protocols but with no luck.  They requested our purchase information and the serial numbers.  We have not heard from them since.  I would have expected better quality.  Buyer beware!

Well, it's like this...The Quest VR was amazing right up to the day it completely failed (26 days from the date of purchase) and upon research of the failure on the Oculus support site I found out that this exact issue (sudden loss of function of the home page, library, and store on the main control panel) has been a known issue since at least May and their suggestion to remedy the issue (simultaneously press the power button and volume control to reset the unit) killed the Quest. Luckily the failure happened prior to the expiration of return date and Amazon has ordered a replacement at no cost. The sad thing about my experience, even though I will receive a new unit, is that the failure issue has not been solved by Oculus.I can't express how ""awesome"" this technology is and how much I want my new quest to arrive, I just hope that the multibillion dollar organization that owns Oculus can fix this little bug.

I absolutely LOVED the original Oculus Rift, but the Quest and Rift S - I am not a fan. Those moments of presence in VR where you are jumping to return a tennis ball or quickly fire off an arrow: The tracking is often lost for a split second. It's not much, but enough to really make the experience less fun. Tracking also requires a ton of light to be effective. I'm so bummed that I was a proselytizing fan of Oculus, now I get angry every time I think about my experiences with Quest and Rift S.Doesn't require a PC to use, so that's something I guess ...

I’m a big gamer, and I had heard of VR technology but not experienced it until this past Christmas. My brother brought his Valve Index and gaming laptop to a family gathering and after 10 minutes in Blade & Sorcery I was hooked. The problem with other headsets like the Index is that they require expensive base stations and are wired to a gaming PC. Plus, the Valve is $1000. I did a lot of homework and settled on the Oculus Quest for $399 and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase.The Oculus Quest is a great ‘mid-range’ entry to VR and honestly in my opinion the best bang for your buck. The Oculus Quest is a completely wireless system. You put on the headset, turn it on, and are immediately thrown into setting up a guardian (play space) and playing immersive tutorials. It is intuitive and requires no other expensive hardware to enjoy the experience. This makes it very easy to share the experience with friends and family (low barrier of entry).The best part about the system? If you ARE a gaming enthusiast with a decent gaming rig, you can link your Oculus Quest to your gaming PC to play more graphics intensive games. You can do this through the new Oculus Link feature with a cable or even wirelessly with the Virtual Desktop app in the Oculus Quest App Store. The wireless setup takes a bit more hoops to jump through, but once setup it works fantastically. There are many tutorials online that explain how to do this.I can go to a family gathering and share Beat Saber with loved ones, but then come home, boot up my gaming rig, and play No Man’s Sky VR wirelessly in the office.This Oculus Quest really does offer the best of both worlds for the best price. Honestly, the 64Gb version is more than enough space. Don’t waste the extra $100. Most VR games are smaller in size and the more intensive games you will be running on a gaming rig anyways.One thing to note is that the Quest’s tutorials recommend kids be 13+ to play. This headset is an expensive piece of hardware that requires care. The Lens are easy to scratch if you don’t take care of them and the controllers won’t take a lot of abuse (punching walls, etc). Keep that in mind if you are looking to purchase the system for children.Also, the lens technology used can feel a tad ‘blurry’ when trying to read white text on a dark background. It results in a halo effect. From all of the research I have done online, all VR headsets are like this currently. It takes some getting used to.

The answer is yes and no, but mostly YES. The only downsides when compared to the PSVR is the refresh rate and the weight. But both of those cons are offset by what you gain. Namely the higher resolution and the quest being completely wireless. It is front heavy and you will feel the heft. It's not a dealbreaker but it's something you'll get used to. Adjust the straps properly and you'll be fine. The ease of use cannot be overstated. The setup for the unit and play area are easy as can be. The ""intro"" to get you used to the controls ran a bit long for me as I wanted to just get into the meat of the interface. The speakers on these are a revelation. So much so that I don't think I'll ever need to get ear/headphones. One less thing to put on my head!  As of this review, I do wish there were more games (something the PSVR has in spades for obviously being in the market longer), but what is there is enjoyable and worth owning the quest for. Another upgrade the quest has over the PSVR is the tracking. You don't need to face a camera and therefore tracking loss is kept to a minimum (if ever).  I love that it's completely portable so you can share the experience with friends and family outside of your home.Overall it's like a refined version of the PSVR but with a few tradeoffs to achieve the form factor and pricing.  I thought I was set with the PSVR, but I was really longing for that untethered VR experience. So glad I bought the Quest.

Edit, 12/28/20:I've had this device for nearly two years now and have a few more comments to make.  First, it's still a great first-gen standalone VR system, with the ability to play graphically-intensive games at a usually-decent frame-rate (expect frame-drops frequently, though).  I'm still rating this a solid 4 out of 5 stars.  It still has issues with smoothly running games with a stable frame-rate, with intermittent stuttering.  Honestly, it annoyed me enough to replace the system thrice (thanks, Oculus) to try and find a system that didn't stutter, but every one I've owned does to a degree.  Four ""defective"" devices in a row seems unlikely, so...I've finally come to accept it's just the limitations of the hardware, running all this stuff on a mobile VR system.  I wish that lightbulb had gone off sooner, as I feel kind of bad now for requesting replacements on something that isn't actually a bug, apparently.  So, keep in mind: If you want a lag-free mobile VR experience...sadly, it's still several years off, I think.Original review:I was lucky enough to receive my Quest on release day and immediately booted it up, having bought a ton of games earlier when the store opened.  Set-up was a breeze (only took about five minutes or so, maybe less), and then I was in First Steps.  Wow, what a cool experience!  I actually replay it on occasion (I love that you can do that!) because it's just so fun.  The controls were fairly intuitive and I find the experience of physically grabbing objects to be wonderful.  Coming from the Oculus Go, the 6 DOF for your two controllers is truly a game-changer.The addition of room-scale to VR is awesome!  I've only had Google Cardboard-like headsets and then the Go, so I had nothing to compare it to.  Wow.  Just...wow.  I play Super Hot daily and it still blows my mind that I can actually drop to the floor to dodge bullets and then roll behind cover!  I have started to use the Quest as an exercise device, with Beat Saber and Super Hot being my favorites (for a game where ""time only moves when you move"", Super Hot is a surprisingly intense workout).  I await the Quest 2 and will buy it day-one.So, for my glowing review, why four stars?  I'm not sure if my device is slightly defective or if I'm just sensitive to screen-tearing and stuttering, but I just can't ignore the stuttering that happens in (admittedly graphically-intense) games like Job Simulator and Drop Dead: Dual Strike.  For example, when loading up Office Worker in Job Sim, the environment lags a bit when moving around at times or when a lot of things are happening.  In Drop Dead, it's also present, to a noticeable degree.  Again, it in no way makes the Quest unusable, but I was immediately disappointed to spot flaws in my brand-new device.  Or is a certain amount of stuttering supposed to happen and expected?  I really don't know, as I've never played games this demanding on a stand-alone headset before.I don't know if it warrants a return or not.  Aside from the stuttering and glitches (my controllers lose tracking in Beat Saber with annoying frequency and reinserting the batteries doesn't fix it), the Quest is near-perfect and I have never had a gaming experience like it.  If I do return it, I'll buy another physically from a store, I think.  Just in case.

Being an early VR adopter and owning the CV1, I was scared of the graphical downgrade, and possibly worse tracking, on the Quest.But oooohhhhh boy, those are NOT a problem!The graphics may be worse but THE RESOLUTION IS AMAZING!  Almost NO GOD RAYS!  I can hardly block the tracking EVEN IF I TRY!  How on earth does it track me when I cover the cameras WITH MY HANDS?!  Amazing.  I mean, holding my hands over my head for a few seconds will cause it to lose tracking, but aside from that, I have never had, or at least noticed, a loss of tracking.  And it works just fine in dark rooms, after all.And you'd be amazed at how many games you can fit on the 64gb version.The only thing I don't like is that I can't seem to connect an external SSD to the device to watch movies...  No reason that shouldn't work.  Hopefully they add that feature soon, or else I might have to invest in a portable NAS.

Oculus done a great job making a VR headset wireless, but the titles and picture quality are just not good enough to support the price. I got mine on the release date and got bored playing it after a week or so. The reason is because there aren’t many good titles you can play. The most enjoyable title is beat saber, but i got bored after a while due to the lack of songs and it has tracking problem sometimes. The headset is quite heavy and it also freeze sometimes.

The Quest VR:it is awesome and as I learn more about it, I enjoy it more. Game library is still currently small, BUT as of writing this, this system is only a year past release, so it's still growing. 120+ at the moment. Plus SideQuest stuff.For a stand alone, it's great. A little pricey, but still a good investment. The haptic response (vibration) in controllers is a huge thing with me. One of my fave game, Real VR Fishing, really gets you into it and while I haven't caught that damn shark yet, it's time is coming as my skills improve.If you want to play Half Life Alyx, you need the the link cable. I think party link is the cheapest. (Gaming pc is needed for steam games) but this CAN act like a Rift if u have the PC. I don't, so haven't tried this aspect of it.The seller:While the shipping was quick, my issue was price. I paid little over $500 for mine, in the week before it arrived, he continued to raise price to nearly $650 on his remaining sets. Price gouging on electronics was ridiculous when the quarantine started and I wasn't buying for that reason. I had a 4 month jump on quarantine before everyone else, just cause of my situation.My advice, look for the best price. Don't pay more than $550 for this. I saw some sets going for over $900 and that's just nuts. Do your research before buying.

Oh My God. That's the first thing pretty much everyone says the first time they try the Oculus Quest. It's a truly amazing experience.I bought my Quest as a family Christmas present last year. Okay, let's just say I bought myself a present last December and called it a family present. :-)  It's Beat Saber's fault. I swear.I'm not going to talk about all the good things. There are tons of people doing YouTube videos that can tell you about that. I'm only going to give you a couple of warnings and maybe a suggestion or two.-Warning one: the battery life is good (about 2 hours), but if you and some friends/family are playing, you can readily burn through that. There are ways to resolve that, including external batteries. See the various YouTube videos that talk about accessories.-Warning two: limit play time (initially). This wasn't just me. Playing too long at first can give people motion sickness, even on games rated Gentle. Once you've had it for a while (not all that long), this goes away.I'm also going to recommend you watch some of the YouTube accessory videos and spend a little more money. I haven't done it yet, but I recommend face shield things that can be more easily cleaned. You might get a little sweaty, and the next person might be grossed out by your sweat. You'll probably want a travel case. i bought the one from Oculus.And get rechargeable batteries for the controllers. You'll otherwise go through a LOT. I went with Amazon Basics. I got a 4-port charger and 4 batteries, so I always have 2 charged batteries waiting for me. Now, ""a lot"" isn't daily. The controller batteries last 3-7 days. But that's ""a lot"" if you use normal, non-rechargeable batteries.Different people will like different games. My favorite remains Beat Saber. It gets my fat old body moving. The space pirate battle trainer thing is fun, as is Gun Club VR. My adult daughters like Moss. I think that's a cute game, too, but I struggle with some of the puzzles. I'm old and slow or something, I guess.If you're having family parties, I tried sharing to my Apple TV via my iPhone. That worked, sort of, but it tends to drop out, and there's serious lag. I bought a Chromecast, and that works much better. It's the only thing we use the Chromecast for. Being able to let other people see the game is fun.

First, I love the actual experience of using the headset.  The experience is so much better than I even imagined.  The games are a bit expensive, but so far worth the expense.  However, the speaker on the right side has failed already, and I keep the sound turned way down.  It failed after less than 4 hours worth of use.  I can still use headphones so I haven't returned it, but for this amount of money, it should have lasted longer.  I would still recommend it for the experience, but I am a bit disappointed in the quality of the equipment.

Raise your hands if you've read this book more than three times like me?Needless to say the concept of VR described in the book and our virtual reality reality were far apart: an octopus of cables and sensors hooked up to a required $1.5k computer which few of us had. In the end, you ended up broke looking like Neo in his battery pod powering The Matrix. So when Quest was announced I thought, eureka!! I pre ordered and for once I was the first kid with the Atari 2600 on my block. In a word, glorious. The second word is ""scary"". The freedom that having no wires provides makes it almost too easy to go down a rabbit hole and lose entire days just playing, messing around and avoiding daylight.Many reviewers have already rattled off the technical pros and cons. There are more pros than cons. Is it perfect? What in this life is?? My face hurts from having this heavy piece of plastic and glass hugging my face for several hours. The battery runs down too quickly  (about two hours) . Yeah yeah, get a battery pack and enjoy yourself.The one major pro that is yet to be fully understood is that now you can hangout in ""places"" and experience ""things"" so frighteningly real that the teenage version of me would never have finished school or formed a family. It is a great system and the potential is truly astounding. Buy with confidence.

I really, truly, absolutely love this VR headset. It’s the first and only VR experience I’ve ever had, but it really is phenomenal. The only drawback is selection of games, and most games are more experiences than anything. That said, I love being able to invite friends over for their first VR experience and love to see their reactions to complete submersion.  Some really graphically impressive games have been released, and new and innovative tech and updates are constantly being added. This is, by far, the greatest gaming innovation since what I recall being a game stopper in my lifetime.  I’ve spent a bunch more $$$ in add-ons, including the HTC Vive headstrap, external battery pack, and a new face pad, and still this is a great deal. I’m so excited for newly released games and Oculus has simply been killing it with their support for this system. RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE!

[Edit] 10/21/2019I am going to up my rating to 4 stars. Oculus is doing a good job at listening to their Users. I wetn to https://oculus.uservoice.com/ and noticed others requesting the same. i also noticed they (Oculus) respond and show they are listening.If they do eventually go to a Multiple Profile OS I will bump it to 5 stars. This product is amazing outside of that. VR is amazing on this.(September 2019)I am not happy about this product but I do want to be fair with this review. So before I tell you why I gave this 2 stars let me say what is good about this product.The GoodThe VR is great. The device does a great job transporting you to a VR world with a great view and cozy fire place in the Menu Room. They selection of Apps is encouraging and I know the library is growing.I have had the PlaystationVR in the past and the tracking was so bad I got sick a lot. With the Quest I have had no issues with the tracking and my VR legs are getting strong.I also love the TV feature in the menu. This puts you in a comfy living room with a mountain view and a monster screen in front of you. From there you can watch ESPN and other TV Apps. It is nice if you want to watch something insulation from others. I just hope the selection of Streaming Apps does increase. Would love to see Youtube TV on this App.The Guardian System is really a brilliant idea. The headset has multiple I believe IR cameras and when you turn the system on it allows you to create a virtual wall to protect you from going too far in games and hurting yourself. if you go too far this virtual wall will appear in game warning you. And it seems to remember the room when you go back to the headset later.Now.... The Bad.Honestly it's just one thing and it is so big IMO I recommend holding off on purchasing this item until Oculus/Facebook address this issue.You can only have one User profile per device. If you want to let others in your house use it on their own profile you have to Factory Reset the device and start over. And!! That profile will have to buy the apps again if they want to play them. When you buy a game it is assigned to the profile not the device. This device was advertised as a Console VR system. This is not a console VR system. This is a personal device for one person by design.I bought this for my family and the way it is designed I would have to buy one for each member of my 7 member family..... Not a chance Facebook.This product has the chance to make VR popular. But not without the ability for multiple Profiles.

First, let me start by saying that I love the Quest experience and games.  This is really is a top notch VR experience.  So, why the 1 star?  I have a Netgear Orbi, and wifi drops every 10-20 minutes forcing me to manually re-connect.  If you google this issue, you'll see that many others who use a mesh type network have this same issue.  Furthermore, they have been aware of this issue since it's inception, and it still hasn't been fixed.What that means for me is that I have to avoid buying any games that require an internet connection.  It's also a pain when downloading games, and there's no way I can watch a movie or do anything else with it until/if this issue is fixed.  And like many others, forget about trying to get any support.  I put in a support ticket over a week ago, and haven't had a response (they say 2 business days).If it weren't for this issue, I would rate the Quest 4 stars.  It wouldn't be a 5, because the other issue I have is that I wanted this for the whole family, but it's only tied to one account.  So, it does not lend itself to multiple users/accounts for games, making this device pretty much just for me only.So, if you don't have a mesh wifi network, I would very much recommend the Quest.  If you do, buyer beware!!!

Whether you're new to VR or are a long time enthusiast, the Quest is an amazing piece of technology.Having experience with a friend's PSVR and HTC Vive, I thought the technology was very cool, but a pain to set up. I always wanted VR, but it's too expensive for someone like me, who doesn't already have a PS4 or powerful PC. I don't really have much time for tethered consoles anymore, so it doesn't make sense for me to invest so much in something I would rarely be able to enjoy. After spending two years with my Nintendo Switch, I can't go back to trying to find time for console gaming.The Oculus Quest has finally made portable 6dof roomscale VR a reality without feeling like it's compromised too much. While there's a noticeable downgrade in graphics, the freedom from wires and the ability to turn any room into a play space more than makes up for it not being as powerful. Thankfully, the resolution is really high. It's higher than PSVR, or the original Rift/Vive. This, and the freedom of movement and wireless game play make it feel more immersive than console/PC VR.The games available, at the moment, are ports of many games that were previously only available on PC/PS4. It's amazing how well they look and run on mobile hardware. The difference between the Quest and PSVR/Vive feels very similar to the difference between PS4 and Switch games. It's a compromise I'm happy to make for an all-in-one VR game system.The Touch controllers are smaller than the PC counterparts, but work amazingly well. Many VR games were built around these controls, and apart from the smaller size work just as well.The inside out tracking and guardian system work almost flawlessly providing 1:1 tracking and a safe play space. Set up takes a minute, tops, and doesn't need any sensors.As someone who works at a group home nearly 70 hours a week, my overnights are now a time of respite. I can keep an ear out for my clients while feeling like I'm somewhere else. This has had such a theraputic effect that it literally feels life changing. I love my Nintendo Switch. It's awesome to be able to play console quality games anywhere, but the Quest gives me a change of scenery. It is also very helpful for someone with a sedentary lifestyle. I'm moving my body more and it feels great.I would highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in VR. It has the power to convert even people who don't play videogames regularly. We're living in the future, and it's awesome! I feel like I have a portable holodeck that's not only fun, but theraputic. I highly recommend the Oculus Quest. This could be just the device that will take VR from a niche hobby to a mainstream fixture in entertainment.

Got this for our son for Christmas this year.  He absolutely loves it and hasn't put it down since he opened it. Well except for the 2 hour or so battery life. The charger that comes with it charges very slow. He decided to use his fast charger from his macbook air and it charges it way faster.  It came with all three episodes of the Darth Vader game.  I tried it and like it as well.  The graphics are not xbox 1 quality but they arent Atari quality either. I bought him a travel case for it as well. Once the headphones come back in stock I will get those because I think the surround sound will be way better.  I think I will rig a battery pack to make the gameplay last longer. I would recommend it.  He would recommend it as well. I'm going to get a few more. A downside is only one person can be registered to it. If you want to add another family member you will have to reset it to factory defaults and clear out the other person. This will erase all their progress and games. However, you can play their games on their account if they let you. So if you have more than one child or adult that wants it they will have to have their own. There also isnt any multi player games out right now. We also purchased a warranty with it.

Oculus Quest is the best way to experience VR. However, quality control issues will ruin your experience.Pros:No PC neededFun games like beat saberFun exercise games like supernaturalAdjustable PDOculus Link for PC VR games too!Cons:Very Poor quality control ruins everythingThe oculus quest is the VR headset to get after the launch Oculus Link... not only can you play PC free, you can also play PC VR games like half life alyx on the quest - it even works with the USB cable out of the box! However poor quality control ruined my experience. Right out of the box I noticed a lot of glare. while ""god rays"" are expected due to the way the lenses work, what I was seeing was from the inside of the right lens being cloudy. The effect is like wearing glasses that you smeared your finger oil all over.Until QC can be improved, I cannot recommend the quest.

I have both a Vive, and a Vive Pro with an Nvidia 1080x graphics card.  This is better than that.  It looks better, it plays better, there are no cables, and it is VERY portable.  No perceptible god rays.  No perceptible screen door effect.  I do not notice the difference in refresh rate whatsoever.  Maybe it's there? but the experience is so vastly improved by the lack of cables and the fact that I can use this anywhere that I do not notice it.  I should note that I had an Oculus dev kit2 and a Samsung Gear VR, so I've been at this for awhile.  I know the difference between good and bad VR.  This is VERY good VR.  I paid $800 for my Vive, and over $3000 for the computer I run it on 2 years ago.  This miracle cost me $400.  I can't see why I'd need a 128G version.  Do yourself a favor if you like cool stuff that works awesome.  Love the controllers too.  I got one of those silicone covers for the headset and controllers too.  Good investment!  I use this for working out (Beat Sabre, Box VR, Thrill of the fight)  I have all of these games on Steam VR and they are much more enjoyable to play on the Quest.

This product shows free returns for the Amazon return policy. I guess I needed to read every tiny detail because they charged me back $124 as a restocking fee. obviously it does not cost them that much.

This is a different kind of review meant for people who could only choose between an Oculus or traditional (PS5, XBox). I had to choose between the two and I opted for the Oculus; it's a decision I regret painfully. It isn't that this is a bad system. We all know that the speed and graphics couldn't compete with the traditional model gaming, but I was willing to sacrifice that for a full-immersion experience. And, ironically, that's why I regret it. The Oculus is just ""too much"" for me in every way. It's too long to get up and running, it's too slow, but most of all, it's too immersive. I like my gaming experience to be fun and casual. I like to hit pause easily and grab a snack, look out the window, or check my phone. It gets exhausting to put on the headset, check the batteries, check your radius of play, adjust the headset, wait minutes to navigate and load your game, and then have to wonder what you're missing on the outside world. The first hour of having this was awesome. Since then, I just don't find it worth the time to play. My advice? Go with PS4, PS5 or the XBOX. It's just easier and more fun.

This is my first time using a VR, the Quest is VERY uncomfortable to wear on my face. It's a heavy device so I don't recommend playing on it for too long as it will leave red marks on your forehead and cheeks (honestly it feels like it tugs at my skin). That aside, the games on it are $10-30 bucks so if you don't plan on spending anymore after you get the VR Quest you're out of luck here unless you connect it to a free game on a computer. The setup on the computer took a while especially since it did not come with a USB-C cord;  low-grade ones will not work so don't even try.After buying an appropriate USB-C cord for the VR Quest, it finally connected to the computer so I could play online games. As for the console games, I played the demo games and all were fun especially BeatSaber which I ended up purchasing with my VR. The battery life lasts two hours at most and then it needs to be charged.  All in all, love the experience--I don't think it's worth $500 even as a novelty item---definitely not. The uncomfortability wearing it is huge for being on your face even for 5 minutes.4.5 stars for the experience. Would be 5 if it wasn't so uncomfortable to wear and expensive for what it's not worth. Will update later if I have anything else to add.::JUNE UPDATE:: The controllers become disconnected often on fullbattery. This has nothing to do with connectivity as I connect my Oculus to the bluetooth? (which I didn't even need to do before..) Sometimes I play and my hand just disappears on screen, or worse, both of them do. Strange since I didn't even own it for a year and I take very good care of this thing.

I've only been using it a few hours, so I might amend this later to give an updated review. However, it's a lot of fun, and I like it a lot. The price is right..The good:it is easy to setup and go. ( I had an initial problem with the left controller connecting, but unpair it and repair it worked fine after)you don't need a pc. just a android or apple phone..Good selection of games to use.Graphics are great.the headset is surprisingly comfortable, you get used to it. It's just a matter of getting the right adjustment.The neutral:Even though you're not tethered to a pc, You still need a fair amount of space to use this.  Most of the games recommend a 61/2 by 61/2 foot guardian space to safely play.  I'd would say based on a person's  height  that the space be at least a foot or more beyond a person's hands if they were to stretch their arms out, like making human letter T, in any direction.  A person 6'2"" would need more space than me at 5'7"" for safe game play.The bad..so far I haven't really run into huge negatives. that bother me a lot.Battery life is shorter than I would hope for, about 2 hours.Makes me wish I had a full blown star trek holodeck.I recommend this, totally work the purchase.

Original Quest would not charge either to a defective battery or cable. Requested replacement and Amazon shipped me a new set before I even returned the defective set. Bravo to Amazon.The Oculus Quest is unbelievable and one has to see it to believe it. You can’t believe the technology!Fabulous product and highly recommended!!!!Having had this product for 3 months, I am downgrading my rating from 5 stars to 1 star. I have just received my second replacement of the Oculus Quest. The Oculus Quest has suddenly stopped charging on my first 2 units. Secondly, virtually everyone who owns the Oculus can’t cast the image from the headset to your iPhone as it is supposed to do.To make matters worse, there support system is horrible and there’s no phone number available for one to speak to a human about a technical problem.My opinion is that Oculus Quest was prematurely released with multiple bugs in the system. It needed months of work by R & D before it was released. Wouldn’t recommend buying until Oculus gets their act together and eliminates the bugs and develop a functional support system, which includes a phone number so someone with a problem can speak to another person.

When I first received my headset, it was everything I could've expected: good graphics, responsive, immersive, etc. But now that I've had it for a month or two, I'm no longer satisfied.I mainly bought my headset to play VRchat. In this game, I was looking forward to being able to experience all different types of avatars and people. However, I can see almost no avatars in this game, and the headset overall is very glitchy.I have experienced many different glitches while using my Oculus Quest. The first glitch I ever encountered was that while playing VRchat, the game would either freeze and send me to my home room (in-game) or would just close itself. Then, I started having the issue of a complete black screen. People in-game could still hear and see me, and I could still hear them. But all I could see was a black screen. My biggest glitch so far is currently happening right now. When I try to turn on my headset, it acts as if it is brand new, automatically putting me into the ""First Steps"" simulation. When I get through it, I am put into my home, where I can see the space around me, but I cannot see my home screen. I can see my menu bar at the bottom, but any screen I try to view simply isn't there. When I try to manually access VRchat or any other game from the Oculus app on my iPad, the whole game crashes in the headset and ultimately puts me back into my home space without my home screen. I would not recommend this headset to anyone and I fully regret buying it.

If you're looking to get into VR (and you can look past the fact that Facebook owns Oculus), this is the headset to get. Being wire + PC free and still able to play really fun games is amazing. Beat Saber and other games are great workouts too!Pros:- Library is growing rapidly / Fun games- Most games are <= $25, All are $30 max- Game Refund policy- Developers listen and patch often- My 95 yr old Grandma thought it was cool- Guardian system- Sound is surprisingly good from headset- Easy to use the Store- Can play while you charge- FB is constantly updating and adding features like Oculus Link, hand tracking, etcCons:- 72 Hz refresh rate on lenses can make you sick on rail movement type games. Not as great as higher end sets obviously.- Casting drops often, even on 5Ghz- Facebook owns Oculus / What are they doing with the data?- Must use FB account to sign in for Social features (friends list, etc)- Foam facepad soaks up and holds sweat (get the VR facepad 3rd party accessory)

First, the Oculus Quest is great.  Being untethered is the best way to experience VR.I've only played PSVR for comparison, and the Oculus is a technically superior experience in every way.  The tracking and motion controllers are more accurate and better designed, and the Guardian system is fantastic.  The only problem is that the headset itself is not nearly as physically comfortable an experience.  It takes much fiddling to get the fit and feel right, and even then, it's not what it should be.I feel that when you pay this much for an item that is otherwise well-made, comfort shouldn't be such an issue that you end up buying additional accessories to jury-rig your headset.  They could have put more thought into the weight distribution, and it feels like they just phoned-in the strap design.  Additionally, you're going to get sweat and oils from your skin on the face mask, and while the material of the Oculus is nice, it just absorbs all that grodiness.So far, I've purchased silicone mask covers for easy cleaning and materials to make a counterweight for the back of the strap.  It has helped, but it's not ideal.  I may try one of the padded strap rigs down the road, but I don't really want to spend the money for more accessories that may or may not help.  If you want an affordable counterweight example, I bought a small pouch of diving shot and used velcro loops to secure it to the strap.

I used to own an Oculus Rift (OG retail) and sold it for a few reasons:1) The screen door effect was awful2) Setting up all of the sensors each time I wanted to use it was a massive choreThe Quest somewhat solves the first one and completely solves the second one. The Quest has a much higher resolution, and ""inside out"" tracking, which means no external sensors. I've read in reviews that people had better results with the external sensors, I completely disagree. I have WAY better results tracking the headset and the controllers with the ""inside out"" tracking on the Quest.A complaint I heard is that the Quest is heavy, I don't think it is at all. Another complaint is the loss of headphones using speakers instead, but I prefer this because if something happens in the ""real world"" (doorbell, etc) I'm not unresponsive and lost in the game.The new hand tracking (in beta) absolutely blew my mind, it's so cool and has a ton of potential for future games once it's refined.Being able to use the Quest as both standalone and as a Rift using the Link makes it more versatile. I've noticed that I need to be plugged into a USB 3.1 ""Gen 2"" port in order for the signal to stay reliable. The standard USB 3.0 (aka 3.1 gen 1) ports seem to cut out or have trouble connecting.To me the Quest is a massive leap forward, but there's still the nagging issue of putting a 1440p screen, a low resolution by modern standards, a millimeter from your eyeball. It does not have the razor sharp precision we're getting used to with 4K screens at a reasonable difference. Until we can get 4K or better yet 8K per eyeball, VR is not able to replicate the pixel fidelity of a console/PC game. That is a long way away, but the Quest proves innovation in other important areas are making the architecture of this technical far more accessible.

This works fine I guess, it's great that they can be used wirelessly or wired like a more traditional HMD. The question I have is more about the future of VR as a whole. The games for this thing are actually pretty terrible, so many stupid games where you stand in place and shoot things, or maybe you're on rails. The medium feels strangled by people refusing to accept any game that isn't 1st person when having games playable in 3D could be promising and make for a larger variety. The battery life hasn't been an issue since I usually get bored of the ""experiences"" long before they have time to run out. The interface is a bit annoying to navigate and it just feels like there's very little to do on it right now. VR as a whole is still hoping you'll be amazed by the ability to control things rather than having control just be part of what makes the game amazing. Hopefully in the future there will be cheaper headsets with less restrictions on what uses they have.

Packaging :High quality. Everything is neat and pretty. Sounds funny, but this is the best nylon wrapping I have seen in my life.You feel this is a premium product when you unbox it.Usage and comfort:This is actually a lot of fun, the tracking is perfect, and some games are really fun. I think this is the first VR device that isn't a niche product - VR for the mass.The real issue with it is, as you can expect, the weight.  This thing is heavy and will hurt your face.  Sometimes you play with the straps and get to a sweet spot.. but mostly it will not be comfortable.  I still play, but I get really red marks on my face afterwards.Sound:Not as bad as people say, absolutely playable. But...one you try it with earphones , that's a one way ticket.Screen:Well.. although this is a high res OLED screen(s), this resolution is just not enough.  It's  OK and you will still have fun, and it will be immersive.. but the resolution is just not high enough at this stage.  It's all pixels (doesn't matter if you use Link or not - the resolution isn't there). You get used to it, but don't expect anything nearly close to what you see on a computer screen - maybe in 3-5 years or so.What I am bothered with is the significant amount of users with Dead Pixels out of the box.  Yes, I have them too.  Around 3 green pixels which never change.  Luckily they are not in the center so I kinda got used to ignore them.  Just a thing to keep in mind if you are a pixel peeper. Get it in a place which will let you replace it if you do get dead pixels.  BTW, google  it, there are a lot of users with the same issue.Prices:Games are generally too expensive for what you get.  No way around it.  The price of a simple VR game is usally around $30. You do get an option to ask for a full refund if haven't played it for more than 2 hours.I'm not sure I can recommend games here as Amazon might not approve this review if I do so..I won't.Conclusion:Really cool device - totally fun.Just be sure to know that you might get dead pixels , the resolution is much lower than what you would expect form a 2020 gaming device, and it is very front heavy.Are there any wireless alternatives to the Quest?  Not at this time.

I purchased this device in July and spent a month trying to get it working, buying every suggested cable and card. I was able to get it working, using advice from other users because the tech support was over run and seemed to be giving marginally useful advice from a pre-set script.Following instructions, I bought the 80 dollar official cable that didn't work, and bought a special card to work with the cable that didn't work, and then bought another cable and some adapters and a splitter, I ended up returning all of that crap and buying a simple Anker USB 3.0, you'll see it referenced in other reviews I'm sure.Now with a working VR kit, I play for a month and all is fine. Except now Facebook has decided it wants to rebrand the Oculus name and take ownership, with a lot of software updates and drivers on desktop and inside the VR headset, all pointing you in the direction of logging in to and then using Facebook on VR. Which is fine and dandy, if it worked at all. Trying to play games leads to random disconnects from the computer, random lockups and freezes in the apps. Lots of other Oculus Quest users reporting similar issues, and no fixes.If you think this is a good deal, just be careful. If it gives you the slightest issue, don't trust the process, get your money back  otherwise you'll be trying to get technical service up to and beyond the time you can return it, and that suits Amazon just fine.

This headset is an amazing platform. Its inside out tracking works very well and the image quality is high. I love that you can choose to see the real world if you want and the room scale guardian makes me feel safe to not worry about my surroundings. And I love that it will remember your play area between uses. This is the first vr headset I have tried that makes me believe the platform is viable. And it accommodates my large IPD.The cons:- the headset is new so its library of apps is small- many of the apps are the same as other platform's just with bigger price tags- it's not yet compatible with the go library (but oculus claims it will)- its heavier then the go but the extra features make it worth it- there is no brightness adjustment so expect the rays of god. If you are technologically inclined you can side load an app to turn on blue light filtering which will help- the battery is a little small but I get why. The headset does not need more weight. Just plug in when using stationary apps

This is my first VR headset, and frankly, it’s my first meaningful VR experience. I really like it overall. I’m impressed with the amount of content available and was pleased to learn that many of the Oculus entertainment apps (Netflix, Venues, Sling, etc.) are available for the Quest. The headset is comfortable overall, but it needs to be positioned pretty precisely or the images are a tad blurry.I think there’s definitely some room for improvement on battery life and the quality / clarity of the screen. I understand that they couldn’t necessarily offer top-of-the-line hardware at this price point, but I expected a little better in both regards. They do provide a very long power cord, but being tethered to a power cord defeats the purpose of a cordless headset.

We got this because my son really wanted Beat Saber.  He loves video games and he can be plenty physically active if we're doing something he likes, but he's not into playing sports.  I wanted him to get more exercise.  He now plays Beat Saber pretty much every day.  He gets a great workout and always has to shower after 'cause he gets so sweaty!  He's told me about so many things in his health and mental state that have improved since he began exercising daily with this game.  It's really amazing.  As far as the system itself, it is very impressive.  So simple to use and setup.  He can take it anywhere, setup his perimeters, and begin playing right away.  The only downside is the face cover gets really saturated with sweat if you're playing an active game.  We ended up buying a couple extra covers that are probably vinyl and don't absorb sweat. Those were a good addition.  All the games are remarkably small compared to what I was expecting.  The 64 GB size has been plenty.

I'm surprised how much I actually like this VR headset!I bought this primarily for gaming and was a little hesitant because at the time of purchase there weren't that many titles that appealed to me (i like FPS type games), and this made the price seem high just to play some VR games (been to several VR game centers in Tokyo so love VR).  However, after getting the headset i realized, OMG, there is much more to the headset than just gaming!  Regarding the limited number of appealing titles, quite a few new games are added frequently.WHAT I LIKEMany Amazon Prime shows and movies can be watched (not all tho), as well as YouTube and Netflix (if you have a subscription).  What's especially cool about watching movies with the headset is it's like being in a large, plush movie theater with a huge screen in front of you!  You look around and see a dimly lit theater, but, once the movie gets underway, the virtual room goes dark with just a large screen in front of you.With the ability to orient the view, I can lay on the sofa or in bed and watch movies or TV programs.  This means watching movies and TV programs is no longer limited to which room the TV is located in!I'm enjoying the Boxing VR workout sessions.  There are a variety of workouts to chose from, and I can do them anytime in the comfort and privacy of my own home.  For the most part, I like the accompanying music selections and the different gym types add the experience.  The workout sessions do give me quite a workout!I didn't expect to have my own virtual home whenever I'm wearing the headset, and the homes are quite impressive.  Some of the views are Sooo impressive and/or relaxing, I feel like getting a beverage, sitting back and just enjoying the view!My fav game so far is Pistol Whip.  It's like being John Wick!  This is an exciting, fast-paced game, which is a workout in itself!You can have the best of 2 worlds; Quest and Rift.  The Quest is an untethered device with the option to tether and have access to Rift games.Since the headset is self-contained and not tethered to a PC, it can be taken anywhere you go for gaming, TV, movies, workouts, etc.WHAT I DON'T LIKEThe headset has some weight to it, so after a while you start to feel the weight.  I've read Facebook will produce in the future a lighter weight headset.The games aren't cheap!  I purchased a couple of titles ""right off the bat"", and I regretted it.  I recommend before purchasing a game, checkout the reviews and watch previews on YouTube to have a good idea if it's something you'll enjoy.

I had never peeked inside a VR headset before buying this sight unseen.  I had read a lot of negative reviews of VR over the years, so I wasn't expecting much.  This probably contributed to my ""holy s***"" reaction to my first 5 minutes going through the First Steps tutorial.  The Quest VR is really a new kind of human experience.  I was truly blown away by home convincing the VR effect is.Now that I've had about 10 days with it, I thought I'd write a review.  The ""omfg, wow"" factor has worn off a little bit, but this is still a remarkable technology that really does transport you into a different realm for a short time.  I have picked it up every day I've had it, and so has everyone else in my family.There are some imperfections.  There is sometimes some glare in the lenses, or other optical deficiencies that detract from the experience.  But for the most part, it is an amazing effect.  ""Running around"" by using the controllers makes me motion sick in less than a minute.  I can't do that, so that limits the things I'm able to do a little bit.  But there's still plenty to do that feels very comfortable.  The Beat Saber game is a nice meditation.  The ""Thrill of the Fight"" game is a surprisingly good workout that has me huffing and puffing in no time.  There isn't a huge library of games, but there's enough good quality stuff right now to tide me over until the library expands, which I'm sure it will.Is it worth $400?  I would say it is.  There's more tech here than in a quality mobile phone that costs $400 and up.  It's a worthy addition as a ""game console"" in the same price range.If you've been waiting for VR to ""make sense"" in terms of price and performance and experience, the time is now.

Most reviews that have anything bad to say about the Quest say that it's not as good as HTC or Rift. Well, I say the Quest is amazing and they should shut their rich mouths. Not everyone can afford a massive gaming rig to run those headsets. The Quest has given me the opportunity to experience VR, which is something I've dreamed of doing since I was 5 (and I'm old)! The video quality is adequate, the sound is incredible, and the immersion is a religious experience. My only complaints are that it's a bit front-heavy after a while, and the battery lasts about 2-3 hours of constant gameplay. Neither of those issues make me regret my purchase. Once I get some more money saved up, I'm going to buy another one so my wife and I can both play together! Thanks for this incredible experience, Oculus! I look forward to upcoming games and accessories.

This is my first VR rig (if you don't count Google Cardboard) and it is unbelievably good. I wanted to try VR and just the set up and ""first look"" app experience was enough to justify the price to me. I'm very excited to see where VR will go. I'm not a gamer, so I need more exploratory apps. I love Mission: ISS that lets me explore the space station - I feel like I'm there. Wander gives me Google Street View in 360, but the interface is a bit clunky. I wish there was Google Earth. I bought Sports Scramble and played it with a friend who lives 400 miles away. It was fun for a few days but now seems repetitive and gimmicky. First Flight was interesting for a couple of hours, then got boring for lack of new experiences. VR in Virtual Reality was interesting. I played through, but got tired of it towards the end. I've tried some of the chat room apps, but they seem populated with screaming and badly behaving 13 year olds. Rec Room has some interesting stuff, but is not intuitive to use and I do not want to watch a bunch of YouTube videos to figure out how to change the color of my ""dorm room"".UPDATE: I wanted to watch an Amazon Prime movie but found it was locked for ""parental controls"". But there are no parental controls in the Oculus. Turns out the only way to watch all the Prime content in the Amazon Prime app is to disable the ""purchase pin"" on your Amazon account. Now you can watch movies, but you are exposed to people buying digital goods on your account. Seems like Amazon should have spent less time on making their VR app cool and more time thinking through the mechanics of watching Prime - which is the main point.

I just got this as my first VR set after researching the many options and I am so glad I chose the Quest.  I was completely amazed by VR when I first used the set.  It is very simple to set up and with the side and top of head straps, can fit any size/shape head.  The eye glasses insert also fits extremely wide glasses, so if you wear them, it is likely to fit yours without issue.  Pixelation is also not a huge issue, the graphics are clean and crisp.  Always make sure to play in a well lit room as the tracking can struggle in a dark or dimly lit room.The biggest issue with the Quest is its game and app library.  The system is fully capable of playing the Rift games, but they just aren't available yet.  You also cannot use Steam VR.  The exception to this is when you plug your Quest into a PC,  you can play the Rift and Steam library, but this defeats the purpose of having a standalone, portable set.  Beat Saber is also lacking the extensive library of custom music/map downloads and mods, but you can get around this by sideloading them onto it, using Sidequest (you can google some great guides on how to do this).The Quest is also missing many of the streaming services apps.  It includes YouTube VR and Netflix, but lacks Hulu, Disney+, HBO, and others.  You can use the web browser to watch from these companies however and there is also an inexpensive Virtual Desktop app so that you can stream movies and music from your PC.

After having both first and second gen head sets I can safely say this is a game changer.  I played this thing in one night more that I did with the two other headsets combined - Why?  Because it's wireless. It has no base stations, has a huge (25X25) possibly playing area.  Yes you take a hit in the graphics, these are snapdragon processors and not Radeon Vegas and nVida RTXs, but trust me - the wirelessness more than makes up for it.  This will drive more VR specific hardware in the the near future. PLUS you can stream SteamVR games with almost no latency  - That is there SOME latency, but very minimal.  I've also started using it to replace my steady state and HIIT cardio work outs with PistolWhip (Using Deadeye and real gun handling) which is a hell of a work out, and BoxingVR and Thrill of the Fight are a hell of a workout too.  I'm able to get my heart rate peak in the 150s after about 20 minutes of good playing with weights on ankles, wrists, and a vest and that is no mean feat as I'm already pretty much an athlete already and it takes quite a bit to get my HR up that high and stay there.I really can't stress how much fun this thing is.  I play it every day now as part of my workout... a hell of a lot more fun than going out to jog or do HIIT.

I have been a fan of VR since trying it in 1992, and always dreamt that one day it would be possible to affordably have it at home.  After owning the PlayStation VR for more than a year, I thought that it was great to have, but still had some limitations about setup, wires, and freedom of movement.Enter the Oculus Quest!  Despite having less graphical power than it's PC or PSVR counterparts, it's relatively low cost and utter portability take VR into a whole new generation.  And Oculus seems to be continually updating and improving it with free updates that add significant new features, like hand tracking without a controller, and the ability to tether to a PC for the full PCVR experience!  This is honestly my favorite bit of tech that I've ever owned, and I would recommend this to anyone that is interested in Virtual Reality but was put off by the cost and technical hoops.

Dislike:The Oculus Quest library is pretty solid but the Quest versions of popular games, such as Beat Saber, are way behind the PC versions in terms of customization options and user-generated content. I am also kind of dubious of how closed the Quest system is and signs Oculus is more aggressively trying to monetize their store compared to Steam.Like:You can use the headset without a PC.This is great for stuff like YouTube watching, Tilt Brush, and many other apps where the Oculus Quest version is just as fleshed out as PC versions.This is a bargain at $400 retailLOVE:Wireless Virtual Desktop to run PC VR gamesYou can run Virtual Desktop to play PC VR titles wirelessly via wifi. Yes, there is noticeable input lag when things get intense but for most players and in most titles, it's not a problem at all.The wireless experience is so good and liberating my wife and I have mostly left the Valve Index to collect dust and play PC VR games via Virtual Desktop.

No video I saw did it justice you have to try it for yourself.ConsSweating and then sharing. Depending on what you play you will sweat so playing with friends is kind of nasty.Grab buttons are very sensitive. It will take a few days to get 100% comfortable with that controller. It’s different And there’s no glancing down to see where the buttons are obviously.Also having to adjust it on your face to have it properly sit for the clearest image is a little clumsy That again speaks to sharing it because once you get it perfectly set you really don’t wanna have to readjust it.Most games are very short. It does not mean bad But $10 for an hour or so ep of Vader??? Ok!  Because it was great and if I ever lose my mind I will tell stories about the time i met Darth Vader In person. The games are getting longer and better I so it definitely has a future. Those are gripes because all in all I highly recommend if you’re interested you’ll probably be amazed.

I've been excited about VR since the original Oculus rift was announced years ago. I've been to multiple ""try VR"" experiences including The Void. I've tried friends headsets and tested the waters with mobile Daydream VR.  The problem is that I'm a casual gamer and have refused thusfar to buy a high end gaming rig to play VR. The Oculus Quest is finally what I've been waiting for!This device has been a blast from day 1. Even my spouse has been blown away by Beat Saber. The quality is a slight downgrade over higher end units but I promise you that you won't miss it. The immersion is second to none and VR without cords is a dream come true.I cannot say enough good things about this unit but will try and be realistic. The fit and comfort of the unit is decent and isn't a problem for extended sessions with it seated properly. Definitely leaves marks on my cheeks though. There is a significant gap around the nose which bleeds some light. This was an initial concern of mine but after real use I've come to appreciate being able to quickly peek through this hole back to reality and it also helps with airflow. I get very hot and sweaty when swinging a lightsaber. The adjusting straps are simple and Intuitive enough for my less than tech savvy wife to pick up immediately.The catalog of games is excellent so far. I have ever been more immersed than when I stepped into the world of Vader Immortal. This VR headset has ruined all other forms of gaming for me. My Switch and Xbox are now collecting dust.Excellent replayability and so easy to hop in for a quick 20-30 minute session. The ability to avoid external sensors is truly a game changer.I am not one to trust Facebook but they absolutely killed this one. If youre interested in VR, then you should buy this.

O.M.G! This is the neatest think since...well, I don’t know what!I purchased this set after trying it out at my Sister’s place a couple of weeks ago. I tried Beat Saber, Box VR and Sports Scramble and heaven help me, I was beyond hooked! I’d just started a diet and exercise regimen and was handling the diet part, but not so much the exercise. My Quest has changed all that.As this is my first VR, I don’t have anything to really compare it with, but I LOVE this system! To me (again, I’m a VR noob), the immersion is simply amazing. There is a “getting started” app already built in, and it REALLY helped me get acquainted with how the controllers work. Plus dancing with that adorable robot had me at the hello wave. 🥰Because I purchased primarily for the calorie burn apps, I haven’t tried any shoot ‘em up games, yet. This does EXACTLY what I purchased it for; it gets me off my lazy keister and exercising! My Apple Watch calories burned have been pretty much off the charts since I started using this, so mission accomplished. Had zero idea that getting my heart rate up would be so much fun!

Mine sadly arrived with a dead pixel in the right eye but thankfully it's impossible to see it during game-play and it only prevalent when turning the machine on or off or i'm in a pitch black environment.I was originally going to buy the Vive and had bought tons of PC VR games ahead of time in anticipation, then I heard that this headset could play PC VR games wirelessly and a wired option for PC VR would come out soon. So I took the risk and pre-ordered it.While there are a few compromises, it works FAR better than I could have hoped. fair warning ALVR may be free but it's kinda crap, bite the bullet and buy Virtual Desktop and then sideload it. the quality is better, fewer crashes and much less compression issues. (If you have good internet, don't waste your money on the link cable, the quality is very similar to Virtual Desktop.)The Quest store didn't have a lot when this headset first released but the quantity of great games now is very respectable.I tend to play Beat Saber and Recroom on the go and play Skyrim VR and Saints and Sinners in my home space.I'm so glad I spent 450 for this instead of 1000 for a Vive and wireless setup or even an Index I can only play in my house.

The quest is unexpectedly more immersive than I anticipated. After reading that they're using a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 I thought that well it's a first gen thing. Surely they can use a better chip in succeeding generations. I can wait for it. What changed my mind is the recent update that allows for a link cable to connect to the PC. essentially converting this unit from a stand alone VR to an optional PC VR unit.  That meant that even if the hardware is replaced, I could still find a use for the headset as a backup PC VR Rig. Since I'm purchasing it in this time frame, Vader Immortal comes bundled with the quest. While there is a number of expensive apps you could buy, there are also a number of free apps you can get. Rec Room, Altspace, bait and a few others. Connecting online also gives you the option to play online VR games. There's easy access to these sites on the quest and I haven't had any trouble playing them. Watching video you can see the screen door effect but I still enjoyed watching futurama on Prime VR and found streaming video from my PC to be simple. I found myself breathless in some of the games which is what I wanted. A means to trick my body into some light exercise while having fun. Motion sickness is a problem when moving without teleporting. I had assumed it would be no different from looking at a monitor and moving with keyboard and mouse but the immersion factor does something weird and its easy to get disoriented. My advice is to keep your turns small and slow and take breaks. Over all I've had a lot of fun with it the first day and look forward to the tech improvements of the future.

I'm having so much fun with the Oculus Quest and I'm glad I got it when I did as it's not available for the foreseeable future.  My main reason for pulling the trigger was for Half-Life: Alyx.  With the Oculus Link cable I'm able to connect to my PC (yes, a wireless headset now as a wire) and get way more games to play albeit with a wire.  You get access to Oculus Rift games AND steam VR games.  A lot of the time I'll check to see if steam has the same game that Oculus Quest is selling so that I can just get it during a steam sale  for dirt cheap.  Yes, once again you'll be playing with a wire but you'll be able to get a buttload more games to play. It's very much well worth it.  I've yet to try side loading apps and streaming the PC games to my headset to avoid having to use a wire but it's definitely an option.Aside from gaming, there's other cool apps you can use. I connect to my PLEX server and watch movies, there's a sports app that lets you watch highlights as if you were on the floor with the athletes (very cool), Amazon has their own VR videos, Google Maps street view is so much fun to visit places around the world like the Vatican, Stonehenge, etc.It's a really awesome product and I just went with the smaller 64GB version because the games aren't really that big to begin with (1-3GB) and the PC games are playing off of your PC.  Mine came with Vader Immortal and it definiely blows everyone's mind when they try it. Get it right meow!

I had never used any type of VR before purchasing the Oculus Quest so I had no idea of what to expect.  I am not really impressed by electronics and am disappointed quite often so I was a bit wary of the Oculus.  However, once I turned it on and went through the 1st tutorial I was absolutely blown away!  This is the coolest device (by far) I have ever seen in my life.  I still can't comprehend how it can be so real and fun.  If you are on the fence, buy it--you will not be disappointed.I can't answer for PSVR/Rift users as I never used those headsets.Pros*An un-tethered VR experience.  You actually feel like you are in that world.  I still can't get over how real these games are.  In Vader, it literally felt like Darth Vader was right there.*Lots of great games*Quick to turn on and jump in*Great controllersCons*I wish the graphics were a bit more clear, but that is not realistic based on the specs/price of this unit (I would NOT get a PC-based VR instead of this---the games are so fun as they are)*The headset straps are not the greatest.

I've tried other VR headsets. They have 2 big problems that interrupt the experience. The biggest is that there are wires. They are always on your mind because they're touching you and you don't want to trip over them or wrap them around you. It seems like a small thing, but it's not as it totally distracts you from enjoying VR. The second issue is that you can't see the walls, desks, etc. around you ... but you know you might hit them if you're not careful ... even though you can't see them. This is a distraction from enjoying the experience too, and it's potentially painful! The Quest solves both. No wires! It also lets you easily define a ""safe space"" in your room, and when you get close to an edge it shows you inside the VR view ... in other words, you can see it when you get close. It's very clever and works great. It feels like magic. :-)

Have a high end laptop (with a mini DP), but I was looking to replace my old Rift. Loved the idea behind the Quest, and it's no doubt, excellent hardware, but for me, it was too uncomfortable, and I saw some compromises being made with certain games in order to keep up with my original Rift's performance (did back and forth comparisons while my Rift was still connected). The screen was kick butt over the Rift, but I missed my Steam games and some of the Rift/S only (for now) games.If I didn't have a capable PC, the Quest would have been a no brainer (eventually, I would have purchased whatever I needed to make it comfortable). The S turned out to be everything I was hoping for. Comfortable as heck, smooth as silk gameplay, a beautiful screen which made the Rift seem blurry in comparison, and no longer a slave to sensors. I do miss the black level of the OLED Quest, but now I can sell off my old Rift. Still excited to see how the link cable turns out. I will always keep my eye on the Quest! One never knows....

Excellent product which is pretty easy to setup out of the box. As well as its use as a standalone VR set, it can also be connected to a PC and play PC VR games. The PC needs to be relatively high spec per Oculus' stated minimum requirements. There are instructions on the internet on how to setup the Quest for wired or wireless connection with a PC. On its own the Quest is already very immersive. With a PC playing Half Life Alyx it truly feels like the future has arrived.The Quest hardware is high quality and controllers are comfortable and intuitive. As important is the software and interface which are excellent and easy to use. Friendly enough so you can just pick up and play (assuming you at least have basic familiarity with your smart phone and home network), but also giving you ability to tweak more advanced settings if you want to.Overall, the package exceeded expectations, especially given the user-friendliness and versatility of not only the headset itself but also the accompanying software, software eco-system (needed for PC VR) and its price point.UPDATE (2020/8/30): I am reducing my rating from 5-stars to 3-stars. Originally, Oculus did not require purchasers to register with a Facebook account. Unfortunately, that policy has changed and in future all users will need to have a valid Facebook account to use this device. I personally do not feel comfortable having all my personal info vacuumed up by Facebook and hence cannot in good conscience maintain a 5-star recommendation. The hardware is good but in future all user activity and data will be logged by Facebook

Update: 2019 Aug 14 : Casting to Chromecast Ultra 4k works with ~1second lag. Occasional freezes but continues.Used to play with Google VR using the phone but the lack of input made it more of a hype.Pro:The Oculus Quest with the two controllers is so much more immersive. Beat Sabre is a whole lot fun with it.There's no perceptible lag in the tracking of the controllers!The portability of it is amazing!I could see ray tracing of the the light glow from the lightsabre in Vader Immortal - so Real!Cons:Managed to cast to Chromecast Ultra with ~1 second lag. Occasional freezes but recovers.You can't record mixed reality videos at the moment with Liv, the Mixed Reality Capture (MRC) support announced by Oculus requires you to have an Oculus Rift for calibration on top of a video capture card.The controller's battery cover tend to slip open during play - especially Beat Sabre where you're swinging a lot, not so much for shooter games.To prevent controller battery cover sliding open or just accidentally throwing the whole controller itself, I highly recommend getting rubber sleeves for the controller, some folks use elastic bands. I've accidentally thrown it once as my hands got sweaty during gameplay.The screen door effect is visible in some games, not in others. *meh* on this one.

My only exposure to VR was the google cardboard which I hated. Made me nauseous, graphics were awful from a phone so never tried anything VR again. I heard so much about this item that I decided to get one for myself for Xmas. So glad I did. I'm now a VR addict and I'm an older gentleman. Games are amazing to play in the virtual world. Beat Saber is addicting.Screen door effect is there, but I don't really notice it much in games and is minimal. Graphics are fine, I'm sure with a Valve Index etc , the graphics are probably much better. But there's nothing wrong with the visuals with this.I'm now gonna get a computer tethered headset Vale/Rift S upgrade as soon as I can afford it. But this is great for quick playing and worth every cent. If you're someone like me who had only tried phone based options then you have to give this a try. And I'll always keep one of these around for the wireless option. Can't wait to see the next generation of this item. I will be buying one of those as well.

Just got it in the mail today.  It took me about an hour to get it going with all the downloads and updates and all.  I already had the Oculus App because I have the Oculus Go, but it wouldn't bring up the Quest for headset to install.  So then I had to uninstall my Oculus App and reinstall the app.  To do that I got put in a long queue because everybody and is brother is trying to install their apps on opening day.  Then when I finally got it paired, I had to wait a while for the headset to update.My main beef is that Oculus didn't update the app I already had, so I wouldn't have to uninstall and then reinstall the app.I'm sure we'll have a lot of fun with it.  We've only just begun.

 This is a truly ground-breaking device for VR. The price is acceptable for the experience you get from it and after attending the Oculus Connect 6 via Oculus Venues in VR, I think there is a bright future ahead. This is not just a toy or a gaming platform. This is a new way to consume content, be it surfing the net, socializing online, watching movies or YouTube and of course playing games. Oculus Connect 6 Day One presentations showed the business sector has some uses for it as well. Getting it now, is getting head start to the future of the media creation and consumption.As for the quality of the device itself - it is my first VR device (Google Mobile VR not counting) so I have nothing to compare it to and perhaps this is a good thing. I understand that the graphic quality is not up to par with the Rift and Vive counterparts, but what it has is enough for the brain to be completely fooled into believing the virtual environments it creates. It's not just my opinion. I took it to work and half my office ordered one the same day. They all were blown away. This ability alone, to take it on the road, anywhere is worth its money already.I've read that it felt heavy for some people but I didn't notice it at all, neither has my wife and my 11-years old kid. The little one 6-years old did complain a bit. The sound quality could be better though again we didn't mind. I bought special earbud earplugs for it (not the original as they are quite expansive) and it, apparently, didn't make that much of a difference. I understand that quality earphones for Oculus Quest have not materialized yet on the market.I really recommend this product and I really recommend reading about what Facebook and Oculus has in their mind for its future (hands tracking in software, completely free in November 2019). This is a great purchase for anyone. A glimpse into the future and fantastic entertainment value for its money.

This thing is amazing. One of my best purchases ever. Even my sister's kids that have the Oculus Rift are jealous. I love that I can wear my glasses with it. I love not being tethered to any cords, and the battery life between charges is good. The graphics are great, and even with no computer, it has been able to handle every game I've downloaded. There were a few cons but nothing too annoying. Quite often when I first boot the headset, it can't locate the controllers. That's fixed by popping the controller batteries out and back in. And the weight of the headset on my face means I have to be careful how I adjust the straps so I don't get a headache. I can't overstate how much I love this thing. I advise everyone to play in a cool area and take frequent eye breaks to ward off dreaded VR sickness, and you'll enjoy the Quest as much as I have. And protect your investment with an inexpensive face shield of some sort, so face grime doesn't collect on it.

I own, in addition to the Quest, the Oculus Go and the Lenovo Mirage Solo.  Both the latter two headsets will usually keep a pretty good charge for at least a couple weeks when turned off.  However, every time I charge the Quest and then unplug the charger (which I did last night) the next time I want to use it won't start and gives me a  low battery warning.  I just tried to use it and it happened again.  They need to fix this!  So my only option is to always leave plugged into the charger which I really don't like to do.  I've tried turning it on after a charge and doing a shut down. Doesn't help.  The battery still drains out in a a few hours.  As much as I like the Quest, and I do like it, a lot, I would not have bought it knowing what I know now.Update. My battery is now keeping a charge just fine while not in use even over a couple of weeks. I might add at the latest update to the headset is marvelous. It’s like I got a whole new headset. I’m really pleased with how they continue to work on an upgrade my purchase.

This was my first VR experience, and initially, I was just blown away.  It's amazing how real it feels.  That said, there just aren't good, fun games to play.  After Beat Saber, there really wasn't much interesting to me, and Beat Saber really lacked a good variety of songs without spending absurd amounts of extra money on DLC.  I did purchase 7-8 games, and there are a bunch that are cool, but none really have great staying power after Beat Saber.  Almost everything in this feels like a novelty rather than a real game.

I have zero experience with VR and paid no attention to it until I started seeing some reviews for quest. I didn’t expect people to be saying such good things about vr but from what I saw in the reviews, being a wireless untethered device with solid motion tracking, my interest grew. I decided to order one and upon receiving it, had read about a lot of the games, pros, cons. My initial experience has been impressive to say the least. This technology is pretty cool and it blew me away with the interaction you have with the hand controllers. Being a console gamer since NES, I had never played anything like this before. It is a game changer for sure. Best saber, superhot vr, and drop dead are all pretty excellent games that I like. I’ve tried a few others and while they are good, the price might not justify their worth. You can tell that this technology will continue to improve as the resolution isn’t the greatest and the battery life a bit short. That would be my biggest complaint...the resolution. Considering $400 can get you a 4K console, the quest is obviously not that and a bit pixely, but by no means is it a deal breaker and doesn’t negate the fun factor. From what I understand that’s the compromise being made in order to be completely wireless, which is fantastic. I can’t imagine being tethered to a high end computer (that I don’t have) while playing these games. At $400 plus the cost of games, it’s a bit steep, and unless oculus continues with a steady stream of strong titles, not sure how long the wow factor will last...it’s incredible technology that will depend on a continual release of new fun games. Just know you won’t be getting console/pc quality resolution. I expect the inevitable quest 2 or quest 3 will be the real game changers, but for now this is an extremely fun device worth giving a shot if you have the money to spend.

The Oculus quest is taking Virtual Reality to the next level. If you only get one app, make it Beat Saber.Beat Saber is the reason I purchased the Oculus Quest. I was playing on my Oculus Rift CV1, and I was thinking, if there were no wires this would be perfect. Boom! Oculus Quest!There is a great selection of game and apps to choose from now that the Quest has been out for a while.Now, with the Oculus link capabilities, you can connect your Quest to your PC, and enjoy much higher quality games. I’m playing Alien Isolation with the Mother Mod, and is is awesome!The reason I took off one star is because while the audio is functional, it is a total letdown compared to the Oculus Rift. Those headphone are amazing compared to what they went with in the Quest. It’s doable, but barely. I’m using some iPhone earbuds until I find something better.  Don’t buy the Oculus earbuds or similar. They don’t produce sound that is worth the money.

If you've used an Oculus Rift on PC, the experience is almost identical to that, but with a slight downgrade in graphics. Fewer special effects, lower-resolution textures, etc. But if you compare the actual interaction and playability within games, the experience is almost 100% the same, and I'd argue considerably better given the wire-free nature of the product. Further, the fact that I can press a button and jump into VR means that I can use the Quest in short stints here and there, without firing up a PC to do it, making it 100x more likely I'll use it at all. This right there is the kicker that makes it even remotely possible that my wife would try it - it's so easy, she can throw it on, fire it up, and get to playing Beat Saber or what-have-you.Battery life is good (2+ hours so far), game selection is good and improving, responsiveness and tracking accuracy is perfect, as far as I can tell, and it even remembers the locations and boundaries I draw for the play space! I'm blown away! Now make a 2.0 with a modern SOC (preferably a new Nvidia Tegra chip) and we're in business!If only this were available 6 months ago! Alas, it's available now, and I can't recommend it enough.

Exceeds my expectations. The package arrives with a very premium look and feel. It was very easy to setup but I did watch a few Youtube videos so I could get up and running as quick as possible. Vader Immortal was my first purchase and it does not dissappoint. It is almost as realistic as the VOID experience at Disney Springs. Wielding a lightsaber in the game works flawless. Tried the other apps and things like Netflix and Amazon Video were interesting to sit an enjoy watch TV or movies. Dont think I would do it that often because the quality isnt as good as my own TVUPDATE - 8-6-18 After 1 week I have bought a few games to go along with this from the Oculus store. Battery life is about 2.5 hours so you need to buy an external 10000+ mAh for longer sessions. I suggest getting rechargeable AA batteries for the Touch hand controllers. Already went thru 2 sets of batteries the first week. I have watched movies from my Plex server thru the web browser. Firefox VR was just released and works pretty good as well. Good assortment of free content. Download SideQuest to install mods and other content not available in the Quest store. I am using Virtual Desktop  to access my Steam VR content. I couldnt get other free solutions working like ALVR. Steam VR content is not flawless, you do get a little bit of stutter every now and again. Possibly a really good NightHawk gaming Wifi router would solve that issue. I have AC1700 Netgear router.

I definitely recommend this device for people interested in checking out the VR experience. In 2016 I spent a lot of time using an HTC Vive in college. In 2017, I decided to purchase an Oculus Rift and I used it for architectural design using custom software. In 2018, I bought 11 Oculus Go's in order to use them to teach VR development at the college level. In May 2019, I purchased the Oculus Quest and I really love it.Fifty years from now historians will look back and may well consider this the watershed device for VR. The Rift and Vive required an expensive computer and were tethered with cables. The Go is only 3 degrees of freedom and one controller. The Quest is the first Minimum Viable Product in my opinion. Here's why: It has a good price point, the graphics quality is just good enough to eliminate the screen door effect, no wires, it's very comfortable, the processing power is just at the bottom level to be good enough for a very good experience and the tracking seems flawless to me. I highly recommend this device with one caveat... Oculus is restricting independent development on the device which might keep the level of quality higher but will ultimately suffocate innovation at a critical time for VR. There just aren't enough things to do with it beyond shooting things. I hope this is useful.

In the first 30 days of using the Quest, I lost 15 pounds and felt like I was 35 again (I'm 57). I started out at 240 pounds. My knees had gotten to the point that I had to go up and down stairs one step at a time using my right leg. After 2 weeks of beat saber, I was able to go up and down stairs like they were nothing and was already feeling 10 years younger. By the end of the first 30 days, I was kicking ass and taking names. My daughter and grandkids said I looked like I was a ninja when I played beat saber. Then Thanksgiving hit. I quit working out, ate way too much and the next thing I knew it was the 10th of January and I had not only gained all my weight back but even more, as I was now 245 pounds. I was back to taking the stairs one step at a time. I'm back on the Quest again, and back to where I feel like I'm 20 years younger again. It's now February 9th and I'm back down to 223 pounds. The thrill of the Fight makes me lose the most weight I think as it is a High-Intensity Workout. But, my favorite now is Pistol Whip. I like to play two ways. For the most aerobic workout, Iike to put it on dual guns and the hardest setting and go as hard as I can. I can beat all the levels doing this without dying but it's hard and you'll have to move your ass to not die. The other way is to truly challenge myself. I usually do this at the end of my workout. Put on deadeye, where you have to be accurate and get it on. Pistol Whip is so much like being John Wick, I started actually thinking it was saying hello Mr. Wick instead of Pistol Whip at the beginning. You'll notice the John Wick references as soon as you hit start. Great game and within 30 minutes I'm soaking wet with sweat. Don't have a large area? I play all kinds of places including sitting down. You wouldn't believe how much you can sweat and how tired you can get after an hour of sitting and playing some of the games. The only think I can suggest is to get into it full swing. I watch a lot of people who barely move in VR, I guess because they're scared, but you've got to get involved and make those hard shots, jump to the side, and duck all the way down if you really want to benefit.

While the Oculus Quest had a bit of a rocky start for me, with some graphical glitching and screen tearing, those issues have since been patched out. Even with those issue though, they didn't hamper my complete amazement and fasination with using the headset. Having tried PC VR before, the lower graphic quality is noticable, but matters little as the experience is still thoroughly enjoyable, and the lack of any wires to contend with is very liberating. If you have ever considered trying out VR, or just want a headset of your own and can't afford a good enough gaming PC, I cannot recommend the Quest enough. Honestly, even if i did have a gaming pc, the Quest might still be my first choice.

It took some years to finally decide to go with this VR set.  The resolution is pixelated since you are so close to the screen when wearing it, but not a gamechanger for me.  The benefits outweigh the cons for a completely wireless headset.  Many of the games and videos are short, but an awesome workout when you have the space to use it.  This headset may be a little weighted for some so compare to other models to see what works for you.  Ultimately, the latest update to use hand recognition is great so the controllers are not required for some navigation.  Great way to save on controller batteries.  I will more than likely respond with more info after longer use but really like this device.

The quest has been the go to for many consumers for the past year. With frequent updates and amazing support from Oculus this headset is a must buy!I recently received mine on June 13th and have been amazed since powering it on. Before purchasing I tried my friends Rift S and found that I did not get motion sick like I thought I would. After researching several products I decided the quest was the best bang for my buck and I wasn't wrong!Once it showed up I powered it up and even though is has a lower refresh rate, at 72Hz vs the Rift S i previously tried at 80Hz. I still did not feel the effects of motion sickness. That was a major concern for me and I am happy to report that its superb in curbing motion sickness, for me anyway.The astounding amount of updates and new software capabilities of this machine has been staggering, considering that is has only been out for just over a year. The fact that you can use it wirelessly and tethered to your PC opens up a massive library of games you can't get on other devices. With the quest you can utilize the quest store for headset specific games, the oculus store for Rift and Rift S games, and the steam store for even more content to digest.All in all with today's current tech and the plethora of abilities that this headset currently possesses i would highly recommend to anyone who is currently in the market for a VR system.Thank you Oculus for making such a great  debut, and then actually spending time improving upon your efforts tbe way you have!! Keep up the great work!!!

I've been a VR enthusiast since the nineties, but only with the current resurgence have I been able to really explore it. I've owned most of the major platforms to come out over the last few years, I recently picked up the Go as a pick-up-and-play solution, but wound up returning it to get this instead. As much as I enjoy the PC VR experience, I have to say it's a lot easier to just pick up the Quest and go to it.Currently, my favorite game is Moon Rider, a free web-based ""Beat saber"" clone with a punch mode which has become my nightly exercise. You know you're on to a winner when you have to pace yourself on exercise. The graphics are not as good as PC, admittedly, but they are good enough, even at these early days. Give it a year and devs will be really pushing the hardware.Basically, VR has been waiting for a fully untethered and portable room-scale solution, and this is really doing the job. I think of it as the Model T of consumer VR: not the first, but the one that will bring the technology to the general public. This is a definite step in the right direction, and a lot of fun.

They make it very difficult to look up the procedure and have links to instructions that do not work.

Worth every penny! This thing has exceeded my expectations. We use it daily for exercise. I use the Supernatural app, which costs extra, but it’s so fun! It’s perfect for someone who hasn’t worked out in years & doesn’t have time to go to a gym. It’s helped my 7 year old & 5 year old tremendously with coordination, & it’s added a lot of fun to an otherwise difficult year! I’m a mom of young kids, not a “gamer”, & even I think this is worth every penny. The only downside is that most of the apps/games cost $$ like they would on another game system, so know that you’ll probably end up spending more $ after you buys this.

Amazing for the price and for what it is, but still not quite a replacement for PCVR, if you have the money to support PCVR that is. An amazing starting point for those just getting into VR, and an awesome continuation for those tired of the cables and setup required for PCVR. A little uncomfortable, still blurry in some circumstances, and the speakers are passable at best, but when you take into account that this is an entire 6 DOF VR experience all built into a headset, you can forgive the shortcomings.

For what it is: a completely mobile VR gaming rig — it’s fantastic.  I’ve had an amazing time playing with it and it’s so easy to set up and play my non-techie girlfriend has no trouble with setup and playing.Cons:It’s pretty uncomfortable to wear. I dunno how they missed the mark but it’s just ... not great. Battery life is decent, at about two hours, which would be ok except for the fact that it takes about that long to recharge it. For comfort and batt life implementing a battery-pack counter-weight improves things considerably.The mobile process is underpowered. That’s not to say that games are good but by going with an older platform ( ostensibly to save money) they sacrificed resolution. The speakers sometimes crap-out, especially when the rig is being taxed.Tracking is excellent, however, and while maybe ‘lower’ resolution, the games I’ve played are smooth, engaging, and so much fun. In most cases, it just works and well!I am overall very happy with my purchase and excited about the future of VR gaming.Oh— I’m a software developer and almost 50!  😀

My first time using this was one of those once-in-a-lifetime moments you never forget.  I cannot believe technology has advanced this far.  I am totally blown away by it.  TOTAL IMMERSION.Shortly afterwards I brought it to a party and everyone got into it.Honestly, I think it was worth the price just for the experience alone.  It's about what you'd pay for a family to go to one of those immersion rides at Universal Studios or something.  Instead, you can use it every day!The Google Earth function is also pretty awesome.  It's like you're anywhere in the world.  Try visiting the top of Mount Everest and looking around!  You won't believe it.

Pros:* easy to set up and use* no additional equipment needed* good stability of VR world while moving one's headCon:* limited frame rate and image detailThe Oculus Quest does a pretty good job for its price.  In a few years it will probably seem hopelessly antiquated and crude, but it's good enough to use and enjoy today.  The illusion of a virtual world is convincing enough that I have to get my bearings when I remove the headset.  Most users may see it primarily as a gaming device, and the Quest comes with a small set of demo games, but it can also be used to stream 3D videos.  Be prepared to encounter encouragement to buy games and connect to social media.To use the Quest you must create an Oculus account, but a traditional Facebook account is not required -- if there's a difference, given that Facebook owns Oculus.  Consider the Quest to be like an early PC or an early smartphone: good enough to use, but not (yet) the ultimate VR device.

The VR experience is amazing. It's pretty easy to get lost in the experience and time just slips by. Actual usage is primarily limited by the number of games/titles. Would love to see more concert and live sporting events for viewing. One note of caution is if you've had Lasik with different focal lengths in each eye, it's difficult to find a good focus with the Oculus. When I had my Lasik, the focus distance for my eyes were not made the same so that I could have vision far away and up close. Otherwise, I would have lost my near vision. The brain eventually resolves this difference. However, with the Oculus, it's difficult to find the right focal point because both eyepieces move together. It would be ideal if each eyepiece could be adjusted separately for optimum focus.

First, wow when I got this I was so excited for it but slowly its letting me down with three things really. Tracking, tracking and tracking. Man I cannot play Beat Saber without it losing tracking. Ive only had it for 2 weeks maybe. And it just keeps getting worse. Ive looked into all the reasons it could be happening, clean the cameras, big room, lots of light. Expert mode on Quest is impossible, the left side (red saber) is the worse it seems. It just disappears sometimes as I'm about to hit a block. Just stops tracking for a second. Maybe I have a defective piece of machinery, I dont know. The game itself will hiccup too. It just freezes and starts up again randomly during times. I haven't found anyone else having this issue yet. But it makes me not want it anymore. I cant do what I want on it. Are their external tracking set ups I can get? Should I just send it back? Should I wait for the new generation or next one? Im not having fun when it happens, very disappointed. I would love to write more or even write things I like about it but that gets shadowed right now by this tracking issue. Hope yours runs better then mine, its just like me to get the one defective Quest. Everyone else's Quest works but mine.

I purchased this device as an entry level VR set and so far it has exceeded my expectations.Prior to the Oculus Quest I only used smart phone VR and Google Day Dream and Oculus Quest takes the cake. With the recent additions of Oculus Link I can see Oculus putting a lot of Effort for updates in the future and with the recent retirement of Oculus GO the Quest is looking like it will only grow from here on out. The portability is also awesome especially to demo at family events.So far my recommendations for the Quest are as follows:-SuperHot- An amazing first person shooter where time moves when you do. A great mechanic.-Beat Saber- Great for the whole family including grandparents.-Accounting+ a fun puzzle adventure from the creator of Rick and Morty.-Rec Room- Great fun for little ones and even adults. I spent so much time just playing dodge ball against my little cousins on PSVR.I strongly recommend for anyone interested in VR and doesn't want to break the bank.

I bought one of these after following a few Youtubers who owned them.  I finally saved up and bought the Quest and was not disappointed at all.  In fact I was blown away by what this device can do for you.  I not only play games on this device but you can download videos that transport you to other places and you really feel you’re there!  I downloaded the Norte Dame Cathedral video and was transported to Paris, France in a matter of minutes.  I love my Quest and am glad I purchased it.  I can take any stressful day, slip on the Quest and disappear into VR for a few hours.  It actually has lowered my blood pressure while I was in the fishing games.  I had been out of the gaming scene for many years and this device has sold me on VR.  If you have the money, buy one.  You won’t be disappointed.

Had to return my ment to be bought new, Quest. Had a previous user's profile already loaded and had to factory reset it. Spent most of the night trying to get it to connect to PC with link, only to find out is usb port was broken and kept losing connection to the computer on and off. I saved up for about 2 1/2 months to even order this. I was trying to buy new to avoid having issues and have everything work smoothly. Now I am without a Quest, and am not sure when I'll even be able to acquire a new one at retail again. Very upset with Amazon not checking what they ship before shipping it. So stuck without.

It’s pretty freaking sweet! I have zero issues with this and quite honestly better than actually gaming on a console or PC. My only thing is sometimes I feels blurry but I am not sure if it's because that’s just how it looks or because it’s not sitting right. I’m assuming it’s cause it’s not sitting in the “sweet spot” as they say so I’m gonna go with user error. It’s a lot of money to dish out but it’s brandnew what do you expect 🤷🏼‍♂️. Honestly if you’re thinking about it and alreadybinterested chances are you know what you’re getting into and have tried out VR.

I wanted an all-in-one VR headset and this baby does not disappoint!Pros: This is an incredibly immersive experience! Nothing like I've ever experienced before. This is the VR we were promised in the 90s. There are plenty of games, from first-person shooters, to aerobic dancing and saber games (that don't feel like exercise!), to 3D movies, historical site visits, and so much more.Cons: It's a little heavy, especially after an hour of use. It also has about an hour of battery life, and I suppose that helps not to binge too long. You can plug it in for extended play.

I bought it on day one, and showed it to everyone in the office. Everyone loved it and many are considering buying it. This is the product that could drive mass VR adoption. The only potential downside is the lack of killer apps like the legend of zelda or mario did for the switch.However, with games like beat saber, robo recall, orbus, dead and buried, I expect you to die, there are plenty of great experiences on here you can play for a long time. But nothing with the long run time and triple A quality of a first party nintendo game. This is written in may 2019, potentially other games could come to the quest and change that, for instance storm lands could.

The pentile matrix of the Quest despite its 1600p resolution caused uncomfortably apparent SDE for me. I noticed it more than the $200 Oculus Go.  I understand for most people this is not critical as most hmd's suffer this, but I don't expect a downgrade in SDE when I intend to upgrade.  Yes it has deeper blacks, but I'm not playing those dark games, and the dark grey of other headsets never bothered me. Switching to the HP reverb was the solution for my specific use cases.Note: for most people, the Quest or Rift S is a better unit all things considered for gaming only. But I privilege screen over everything else. And since the Reverb thus far can do everything reasonably well, not perfectly but satisfactorily, and has a fantastic screen compared to the others, I'm now set.

Too heavy. The thing kept wanting to slide down my face unless I tightened it to the point of it hurting my face. With or without the glasses spacer, it lets light in which causes odd halo effects.Quality is not significantly better than the Rift that I already have. In a dim room or a room shaded on one side, the tracking can get very shaky. I'd rather just have sensor bars and a steady view.Screen door effect is fairly strong. Focus blurs as the unit slides down the face, so considering the weight of the unit I found myself holding it up with my hand just t o get a steady image.Nice try, Facebook, but the hype doesn't meet the product in my hands. Maybe VR needs time to grow, or maybe I need a higher end unit.

Absolutely amazing and fun device for all ages! Rated four stars because of the slightly ""fuzzy"" imagery. However, I suspect/hope this will be improved to a crisper image with future generations of the device. This is also something to be used with caution for those that get motion sickness as easily as I do. There are only a a few games/apps that I can enjoy without triggering a headache. I highly recommend adjusting the setting for less likelihood of motion problems, but some games just have to be avoided altogether. Lastly, the device is heavy and can become uncomfortable to wear on the forehead, cheekbones, and neck after awhile. Hopefully, they will also become lighter weight in the future. All in all, though, our family loves this and there's something fun for all of us to enjoy...from games to meditations and everything in between!

Problem 1: I got my oculus a couple days ago new. everything was working just fine. i set it up and put in the batteries that CAME WITH the oculus quest. i played for a day and it was amazing. The next day i was playing and the right controller stopped working. i thought it wasn’t that big of a deal and just took them out and put them back in. The controller didn’t work still. so i took them out again and noticed the batteries were LEAKING OUT. i was really worried. i went and got new batteries and put them in, didn’t work. so i tried cleaning the controller out with rubbing alcohol, didn’t work. i wasn’t paying $70 for a new one so i was going to message oculus about my problem. but couldn’t find anything to message them on. then i tried to find there number but couldn’t find that either. i found something about submitting a ticket to them, then wait 1-2 days to see if they would respond. i gave my controller a couple hours to rest and would come back to it later. i came back and it didn’t work. so i cleaned it out again and let it sit for a couple minutes. then i was about to submit my ticket but i put the battery back in and it worked. i let it sit for a while then i came back and started playing. It’s been 2 days and it’s been working fine. whenever i take the batteries out and put them back in it won’t work sometimes so i’ll just try again and it will be fine. i’m still very upset about this and i’m sorry for other customers with this problem.Problem 2: this isn’t a big problem but i’d like the put it out there. whenever i try to cast my oculus to my phone it never works. it’s only worked once by casting through my oculus to my phone. but it doesn’t work now. then i’ve tried casting through my phone and it says something will pop up on the oculus but i get nothing. i hope i can fix this problem.other than that the oculus is an amazing device and i love it. i would give it 5 stars if i didn’t have those problems though.

This thing is a blast. You really can’t get an impression of what it’s like from YouTube videos. Really a game changer!Only two minor issues: the lenses are blurred at the sides, but fortunately the “sweet spot” is sizable enough that it isn’t an issue. Just something to expect before you buy. Also, my eye-width slider only goes down to 59, but tends to stay at around 60. Supposed to bottom-out at 58.Strap a battery pack on the back with some velcro tape and it adds substantial playtime before needing to plug it into a wall, plus it acts as a counter balance!

Ok, I would like to start of by saying this is a good product, it is a good vr headset. However, it really annoyed me that Oculus decided to sell a prototype headset for ~$400 and release a better, cheaper version, maybe a year later, with little warning. Again, this thing is a good product, I’m just really pissed off. The negatives of this product are same with most other consoles, freezing, crashing, occasional bugs, but there are some worse things. A couple months ago mine had a software update and it caused it to black screen, everything went black and I couldn’t do anything with the headset, so I had to factory reset the thing, and occasionally  when I tried  to launch games the headset just shut off, these problems have smoothed out and are less of a problem recently. All in all, just buy the newer cheaper, better one if you getting a quest. A dick move from Oculus.

I have a vr ready pc, but I have never used a vr headset before. I was picking between this and the rift s because the quest seems like a lot of fun. I was worried about performance issues, framerates, and the refresh rate of the screen. None of these were an issue. Framerates was great, the Hertz of the screen is really nice, and I have not experienced performance issues. If you have never ever experienced vr, you have a vr ready pc, you travel, and you are picking between this and the rift s, go with the quest.

It's unclear why so many Amazon stores are allowed to buy up the world's inventory at retail then sell for $130 more. If this were an essential item during a global disaster, this would be price-gouging. Why can't they buy wholesale and sell at the retail price? This business model will not last as I will pre-order whenever possible. That being said,  Michael's had the earliest delivery promise under Amazon Prime and no extra charge for 2 day shipping, which has been slipping due to Covid-19.  I was shocked that Michael's shipped it the day of the order (Saturday) and it arrived Monday. I'm so happy to have this now when most other inventory is gone. Maybe the extra week or two of use was worth the extra hundred. It's a fantastic product. The tracking within a playspace is what makes this mind-blowing beyond other VR. It will remember the map you created. You can walk from room to room physically while moving in the virtual world. I like to put furniture where the virtual furniture is and take a seat when needed. The headset is front heavy and hurts my head and face. I had to find the best balance and also used a scarf as a headband. The experience is worth it, but don't play too long. Take breaks.

This is probably one of the best value VR headsets on the market. It's important to recognize that Oculus released an Oculus Link cable(basically a high quality USB-C), which allows games from the PC to be played without the limitation of the Oculus Quest store while still retaining the portability. The battery can last for a few hours, but you will want to charge it pretty often. The controllers don't burn through batter that quickly, and it's intuitive to use. I haven't had any frame issues or the screen door effect, and it fits with glasses well too. It's lightweight and there can be no cords involved, making the VR experience much more liberating and enjoyable.

I own the Oculus Go and the Oculus Quest. I picked up the Quest because of the better resolution, hoping to view videos shot on my Insta360 EVO camera. I assumed that the apps available in the Oculus Go and Quest store would be the same. I was wrong.The app to view video directly from the EVO is available for the Go but not for the Quest. Apparently the Go is considered an entry-level device by Oculus - made for watching videos and playing some light games - and the Quest is built for more hardcore VR gaming. There are other gaps in the apps available on the store as well, but for my purposes this one was the most annoying.I understand that there can be hardware limitations on the Go, but the Quest is their flagship product - anything that runs on the Go will run in the Quest. Not offering the same apps that run on the Go and trying to pigeonhole users into different categories is short-sighted on Oculus’s part.Other than that, the Quest is well built, the graphics and sound are excellent, and the interface is well executed. If you’re buying the Quest or the Go for a specific purpose, make sure the apps you want to run are available on the device you choose.

I ordered this for a Santa gift for my kids. Product arrived quickly. Box was in great condition. Batteries came with the product so you could use the game and remotes right away. I will say I was very amazed with how realistic this is. You really feel like you are in the Games! You also can sync this up to your phone and watch what the player is seeing. It makes it more interesting.A couple downsides to it: 1. One of the batteries was bad or exploded as when you opened the remote backing, it was sticky and there was the white powdery substance that you see from bad batteries. It is all in the remote. It has not affected the use but for the money spent, I was a little upset. 2. You can’t create more than one profile on this. I set this up prior to Christmas morning, and set it up under me. I found out when the kids wanted to play, that they aren’t able to have their own profile. As far as I can tell, if you play a game and leave off somewhere, it’s going to pick right back up where it was left off when someone else plays.Overall, I’m very satisfied with this product. It def gets you moving and provides some exercise. It has been a good device for me and the kids to do stuff together.

The little dome on the mountainside atmosphere that you are in while accessing the menu is worth the price right off the bat. I didn't want to give my son (whom this was a bday gift for) a turn on it. I loved it. Games can be pricey, but comes with the territory I imagine. I have a feeling this is going to be a fun and wonderful investment. My only complaint is the fact that upon opening the box, I discovered that there was absolutely NO paperwork included. Nothing. No user manual. No quick reference guide, no warranty card. Nothing. It is my fault for not checking if it was included. I assumed it would be, given it is a gaming device, but assuming is notorious for incorrect outcomes. All in all, I believe we will get years of enjoyment from this fun gadget.

The Quest is a very impressive machine and actually feels like VR is ready to really take off. The ability to setup anywhere is great especially sticking it in a bag and heading to a friends house. As the software updates more features become available like pass through+ and soon finger tracking without controllers. There are tons of pros but using it I have found downsides that are by no means make it a dealbreaker.Cons:- Needing a smartphone to set up the quest even if you only need it once why not just eliminate that step all together.- The way the headset tracks the controllers is the four cameras on the corners on the front side of the unit. There aren’t any on the side so it will lose tracking which for some things makes it frustrating-The touch controllers would have been nice to just have rechargeable batteries instead of AA batteries. I would have probably bought a base station for it if this were the case and I’d definitely recommend getting some rechargeable AA’s.-Not being able to stream the image to any smart TV or computer is annoying. I understand it works if you pick up a chromecast TV attachment and it can stream to smart phones. Like I said, just seems annoying since just about everyone has a smart tv but not a chromecast it’s just one more useless thing to buy.- The visor part that your head rests on is cloth based and it absorbs all sweat and will feel drenched after strenuous activity on Beat Saber, won’t be much passing around the headset then.Pros:- If you have a decent computer and a good home network you can have a untethered PCVR and it works brilliantly, google it there’s multiple ways to accomplish this even for free.- Oculus/Facebook is relentlessly updating the software to add incredible featuresThere are cons that I went into detail about I feel like a lot of people will run into them. The pros which I only listed a few of tons more, by far outweigh the cons I’d recommend anyone to try out VR with the Quest.

First off this is a great product really entertaining for friends and family it becomes the life of the party and has endless hours of play time to give. that being said getting into the PC aspect of it. there is some limitations with this product. since there are no sensors (outside the ones built into the headset) given with said product. a lot of occulus Rift games played through link can appear really clunky slow and not fun to play. Gorn, Blade And Sorcery are good examples. two handed weapons are impossible to use because your tracking goes bunk any time you move out of the angle. Gorn isnt terrible but B&S was very apparent. even single handed combat in B&S was a chore and really not solid or smooth at all. now is this really a deal breaker? not really it plays games like walking dead saints and sinners pretty decently and smoothly. its a great headset and since the Rift has been sold out for ages and hardly comes back into stock this is a good alternative IMO. shooter games run great like Pavlov and you'll be able to access any VR game but take that with a grain of salt because you wont get the best tracking possible without room sensors. i believe you can purchase and link to the headset but you'd have to look for guides. if you want the best of the best for your PC you might want to spend the extra money to get an index or Vive but its up to you. if you are only going to be playing melee combat games with intensive tracking id do some more research to see if this is best for you. if you are casual maybe play some VRchat or TWD some shooters id go for it. it is kind of a steep price range though if you will only be using it on PC id just wait until you can get your hands on the Rift. or go with another headset. if you plan on playing it with friends in the living room or with family this is definitely the headset for you

After the first day, I feel like there is already so much to do in this realm of virtual space! There is not much you can't do, provided this industry keeps growing! You will definitely entertain friends and family by letting them put it on and let them experience this wizardry for themselves. The only issue I have had with it is getting a little motion sickness from trying to move with the control sticks rather than teleportation or just walking around. There are not many games that make you move with the control sticks, so that is good.Your guardian space , the space in real life that you make so that you don't bump into things, is really neat! You can peek our and see the real world in black and white with your headset on...no need to take it off! I played about 2.5 hours straight, and at that point, it does feel a little heavy, but I will make sure to take breaks more often in the future. I like testing the limits of things (even if I try to catch a frisbee above my head and smash my hand into the ceiling...yes I am a tall person!)I hope whoever reads this review understand just how much fund you can have in a non-real place. There is so much to do already, with more to come! You can hang out and watch movies with your friends and talk like they are right there. I think this will be the next step with social encounters. Anyways, get yourself one, and have a blast! You won't be sorry!

The Quest is a really great headset. The only real downside is that the graphics and refresh rates are lower than what you would find in PC headsets, but it is by no means unplayable and doesn't ruin the experience at all. The wireless capabilities are nice if you want to bring it to other people's houses or if you just don't want to deal with wires getting in your way. I have tried the Rift S and it definitely has better graphics quality compared to the Quest but the benefits of the Quest outweigh that negative. As for the storage, the 64 GB is plenty and especially with the option of PC linking, I see no reason to go for the pricier 128 GB. Overall, it's an amazing headset that is well worth it.

I've been interested in VR since the very beginning, but, as a younger person just barely out of college, I never had (and still don't have) the means to afford $800+ setups. I finally decided to treat myself and grab the quest, and man, I am absolutely blown away.As soon as I put this thing on my head, I was smiling like an idiot. As my first vr experience, having only seen it through YouTube videos, the simple joy of feeling totally immersed and interacting with things around me was mind blowing. I couldn't help but pass it over to my girlfriend who was watching, and my dad a few minutes later, and they all had the same reactions: big, goofy grins.And that's what makes this device in particular so special. Out of all the VR setups, this one has to be the most social. With the quest, you don't need to have someone follow you to your bedroom where your pc is, or worse, lug the pc somewhere else. Just take the headset off and pass it around. It's so simple and fun.As someone who has never used VR before, the graphics in most games I've played look great. You can tell they've been toned back in some places, but honestly, the games are too fun to care. If you're coming from a pc, you'll probably see a graphical downgrade, but this device isn't meant as an upgrade. It's an alternative.Recently, oculus just announced the icing on the cake, making the Quest possibly the most versatile VR headset around. Soon, they'll be rolling out Quest Link - if you already have a gaming pc, you can connect (via their premium cable, but still...) to a pc and play full, pc oculus games. Not only that, but in an update, they are rolling out hand tracking. No need for controllers at all. Just your hands. Pretty cool, and I had no clue when I bought this. Now it's essentially the Nintendo switch of VR. Best of both worlds.I'll finish by saying this: if you have been interested in vr, but don't see yourself getting a gaming pc and $800 headset, then this is the device for you. Full stop, best bang for your buck. Just get it.

I got the 128 GB version from Amazon.Pros:The guardian system is cool and I DID NOT GET ANY MOTION SICKNESS with the 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF) that comes with this front-facing cameras guardian system. However, it's probably related to programs that took advantage of the 6DOF.Vadar Immortal would best summarize as YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE THERE! It's only episode 1 but it's just incredible!.All the games I tried were interesting and fun. It's much bigger then what you see in the pictures. The pictures just show the frontal view. You feel the presence and the movie theater screen looks like iMax. Network videos and pictures ran well. 3D videos also work. Some of the games involve significant physical effort.Cons:The headset is front heavy. You really feel the weight when watching videos but not so much when playing games.Facebook/Oculus should consider making an improved version of ""Oculus Quest Standard Facial Interface"" as an aftermarket optional accessory to help dissipate the weight of the headset especially at the areas underneath the eyes. That'll drastically improve the user experience.Screen door effect is noticeable during video watching.Video quality is not that sharp especially in slow gaming environments when you start focusing on the details.Summary:Incredible technology with tremendous fun factor! The feeling of presence and lack of motion sickness with programs that take advantage of the 6DOF are amazing!

Purchased this just in time for Christmas, and oh man I think it was a mistake...it’s just too much fun! Haha! My son is addicted to the boxing games on here and can break some serious sweat while playing. My brother loves the beat saber game. My nephews both play Super Hot and Vader Immortal. We are planning on getting a second one for the household so we can do some local multiplayer stuff! The headset is made of great quality. It’s comfortable out of the box, but I can see why they make so many other accessories for it. I don’t know whether the ease of use or the family time we enjoy while playing it is the best thing about it. I guess you’ll have to try it for yourself and see what it does for you! Enjoy!

The head piece fits nice and if a person wears glasses it can be adjusted to accommodate your eyeglasses without damaging them so that's a BIG plus. The roller coaster ride through the dinosaur jungle made me quesy but that's just me.My husband loved it and the boxing game and got a good work out!

My God. I ripped my hair out for a week trying to figure out how to get Oculus Link (still beta) working. Now that it's working tho, WOW. I have a gen 1 rift, that I'll be giving to my roommate, as this headset does it all.This replaced my plug-in rift, and doubles as a mobile VR system. Couldn't be any happier.Advice for those just setting up Oculus link.Get all the latest drivers/firmware for your graphics card and quest. Make sure it's all installed.Make sure you have the best USB cables you can get your mitts on (along with ports on your PC that can supply the correct amperages)Turn off the Nvidia screen capture thing (can't remember what it's called, but it's in your get force experience)Quest link has been running flawlessly on my Alienware m17r5 laptop.Again. Quest is pretty neat. Couldn't be happier.

So, I own the Vive, and thought this would be a good supplement for bringing to friends' houses to show them VR, or to have something for the living room.  For those instances, it's fantastic... if you don't have a PC VR setup to know what you're missing, it's really hard not to love the Quest.  If you have a 5' x 5' space and a computer capable of running the Rift S though, get that, it's so much better.  Still, for those with deeper pockets, this might be perfect as a supplement, or to do things like play beat saber in a different room in your house.  I had to decide between one or the other, and having a PC capable of running the Rift S, I just felt like I was giving up too much with the Quest.

Was thinking about getting into the VR world. I have a pretty beefy gaming pc in my basement, but I didnt want to have to hang out down there every time I wanted a friend or the wife to play beatsaber. Read that the quest is going to support tethering to the pc, but can also be used completely stand alone which is the best of both worlds. The only downside is the 72hz refresh rate, but based on comments by Carmack that it can technically support up to 90hz, I am expecting the modding community to figure that out at some point, or have Oculus officially update that. Seriously great purchase and well worth the price of admission. We bought a second one for the wife 1 day after getting mine.

The good:I love my headset, its by far the most complete VR hardware and software package on the market (of it's time) and has amazing performance for being a mobile VR headset. Wireless VR via Virtual Desktop is shockingly actually really usable and allows me to play Half Life Alex while my PC is across the house.The bad:I had to stop using my headset last year due to the fan geometry in the headset drying out my eyes and the skin around my eyes. I think it's due to the fan in the back of the headset sucking air from around the eye pieces and blowing it out the front of the headset. It's great since it keeps the graphics processor cool and the lenses  free of fog, but since the only real opening is next to the nose, the air is sucked in around the nose piece, hits the users eyes, and then flows into the headset. This strips moisture off the users eyes and means I can only use it for 30 minutes max on dry days during the winter. I would just ask the hardware engineers working on these headsets to consider users in dry climates and add vents around the headset to avoid air having to enter next to the nose piece.-Thanks!Colin

Its great to have Parents, and grand parents who arn't into technology try one of these headsets just to be blown away with how far we have gotten in tech. But however I did not find myself using it daily or nearly as much as I thought I would, but its great for parties.  My ONLY complaint is how much every game is on the oculous store opposed to the steam VR store, you can use this headset for PC VR games outside the oculous store but you would have to buy Oculous Link or a alternative which will put you 30-80 dollars in the hole ontop of this. Which have some problems of its own. But its a great way to show how far we have come in Virtual Reality. Another Almost Perfect

Stay away from Oculus headsets until they get their quality control up to par. I've owned 4 Oculus headsets, starting with the Go. Every one of them has had issues.The Go (from Walmart) arrived with a dead pixel, so I sent it back. I liked the technology, though, so I decided to upgrade to the Quest on the next go around.My first Quest (from Amazon) arrived with a swath of darkened pixels at the top of the left eye. It was very disorienting, so I set that headset back. They were out of stock, so I had to accept a refund instead of a replacement.About a month later, I ordered my second Quest (from Walmart). It arrived with a frozen/dead green pixel, popping sound issues (or no sound at all), and would randomly freeze and crash. I was busy, so I didn't thoroughly test this headset. When I realized there were issues, I had missed the return window by 1 day.So I sent that headset in to Oculus for repairs. The RMA process was easy enough, but what I got back was another faulty unity (directly from Oculus). This one arrived with sound issues, and recently, the tracking has started to malfunction.What are the odds that all 4 units that I've owned would have issues? They obviously have some serious quality control problems. These headsets are not worth what they're charging for them. Not at this failure rate. I'd stay away from Oculus until they get their stuff together (if they ever do).

This is a great system, our family had so much fun with it. HOWEVER...I have to only give it 1 star based completely on customer service. The only way to contact them is email, and every email takes 2-5 business days to respond. Some responses are maddening, like....""when you gave us your address, you left out the zip code"" even when the zip code was encluded. That took 10 days total in response time. We have had a broken unit because it fell off my son's head while playing a game and hit the floor. It is December and has been broken since September.

The Oculus Quest is amazing! NO WIRES! Many say it is uncomfortable and I can agree but everything else that comes in the package makes up for its faults. The Oculus Quest can play many games and looks AMAZING with its OLED display with the 1440x1600 display! Though the refresh rate is lower than other headsets, it is not noticeable at all. Tracking is insane especially since it has no external sensors. Finally the setup, THE SETUP IS SO EASY! Takes less than 5 minutes to set up and you can begin playing.

This review comes from someone who has tried a bunch of VR headsets and owned a PCVR - Oculus Rift. I was a sceptic about it but wanted to see what the wireless freedom got me compared to PCVR. I will be getting a second one for multiplayer and getting rid of my original Rift.This is a game changer. If you are considering it, go for it. Everyone I have introduced this to in the last week has said they are buying one. The ease of use and wireless really out way any of the (small) cons. The quality of games is much better than I anticipated. My 11 Year old son and 5 Year old daughter use it like crazy. You put it on and within seconds you are in VR and launching whatever game/app you want. Oculus knocked it out of the park with this one.I added a battery pack to it to extend playtime. It charges while playing and we got about 5 hours total out of it while we had a bunch of people over sharing it.

I don't even know where to begin. This Virtual Reality Headset is top of the line. Anybody looking for more freedom in virtual reality will enjoy the guardian boundary (similar to Steam's Virtual reality boundary). The tracking has gotten much better in the past update bringing tracking to be more reliable and accurate. The lower refresh rate (in comparison to other headsets) does not decrease the immersion you will enter. I've gone hours at a time playing vr simply because I was so immersed and lost track of time. Games like Beat Saber will not have issues tracking as long as your hands aren't behind your back for too long.Some cons:1. The slightly smaller game library may put off some people, but many game developers are introducing their games to sideloading through sidequest.2. Oculus has been denying many developers from their store library for some reason. Games like Pavlov VR were denied resulting in them being forced to use sidequestPros:1. Incredibly immersive, and fun2. PC VR streaming is possible after jumping through a few very small hoops3. Ease of use. This headset can easily be moved from one place to another and set up within 30 seconds.4. Great way to spend time with family and friends. Although you will have to purchase (if not already owned) a Google Chromecast 3rd gen or newer.

I am surprised at the quality of the standalone VR experience.  The real bonus to this device is that you can connect to a gaming PC and use like an Oculus Rift S. And.. if you have a little technical know how you can get that feature working wirelessly! Mind blown! I would definitely say that as of 4/2020 this is the best bang for your buck for VR.

The apps available in the Quest store are good as well, though may be lower fidelity than the PC version. I'd personally recommend Beat Saber, Superhot and Vader Immortal

Minus the way Facebook scumbagged the games forcing you to only be able to play games from their store, even going so far as making Virtual Desktop remove the ability to stream games specifically off of Steam. The headset itself is great, but the downside you may find is the games are smaller scales of the original. They left that out entirely before launch as well. Those factors aside the headset is still wonderful at what it does. You can play anywhere and my kids absolutely LOVE their game time. Some titles are cross play from the Rift, some, not all. Also more reason to purchase from the Oculus store. I will check if titles are cross play before I purchase them. Sometimes it requires a little hunting since they havent quite thought ahead to put that in an easy to find spot every time. Half rambling probably but I do highly recommend for the kids or yourself if you don't have a decent PC for a Rift.

I am female, 60 years old and have had so much fun with the Oculus Quest!! My son is stationed approximately 6,000 miles away. He has a Quest as well. We have played paintball in rec room and a few other games. Most awesome experience ever! I talk to him, his avatar even smiles when he smiles! Wow, technology! I am petite so my only complaint is the general fit of the headset. Other than that, fantastic and so much fun...even for an older person like myself.

Absolute Garbage! I have nothing good to say about the Oculus Quest all in one VR headset. From the moment I received this, it was a headache. The headache didn't go away until I sent it back. No, wait, it's still there. Caused by just the thought of it.I'll start this rant with its weight. It weights 1.5 POUNDS! Way too much for anyone's comfort. You the consumer will have to spend at least an additional $150 dollars to make it comfortable enough to wear for just a short period of time. Then, the odor! Something in its materials just absolutely stinks. That alone made me want to puke.The software is nothing more than a means for Facebook/Oculus to gather information about you, or any person whom uses the headset, to tailor their ads and slap you in the face with it. Its buggy, it lags, its choppy. My list of negative adjectives goes on for days.MAKE NOTE OF THIS: If you are a Simmer, ie: you play simulation games such as Digital Combat Simulator or Microsoft Flight Simulator, this is not the VR headset for you. STAY AWAY! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS HEADSET! The effort, work and software that MUST be downloaded/sideloaded to get the headset to work in those environments is monumental. Definitely not a ""plug and play"" device.Lastly Facebook/Oculus, DO NOT reply to MY review with your corporate ""contact our customer service/support, we'll be happy to help you"". It will be nothing more than confirmation that you manufactured a (add your own expletive here) product that serves your purpose and not those of your customers.

Followed the rebirth of VR from 2012 (duck tape prototype, Dk1 etc.) yet never pulled the trigger on buying a headset until now. The portibility and convenience of just being able to throw it on my head and transport myself to other worlds instantly is amazing. I am 42, have kids and have very little time to game. The half hour I get just to therapeuticly pop the quest on my face is...well...theraputic.

I experienced VR the first time a couple of years ago, but the system required a high powered computer to run it. The Oculus Quest is a stand alone VR headset, operates on its own, no other equipment needed. The VR experience is very good, although I'm a relative newby, so I'm not really an expert. Lots of games/apps are available as demo downloads and you get a real good idea whether or not you want to spend the money on the full version. A little spendy, but a huge jump up from the Oculus Go, from what I've read. Go for it!

I don't think I've ever purchased an electronic gaming gadget that I've enjoyed as much as I had the Quest.  The quality of the display is unreal.  The sound is outstanding.  It takes a little getting used to wearing it, but that actually happens pretty quick.  As for learning how to use the controllers and playing the games that comes very fast.  I've found myself running the battery down a couple of times playing games while sitting, but that's actually a good thing, it makes me take a break from it.

I bought the very first Samsung Gear VR years ago for use with the Galaxy Note 5 and was amazed then at the technology. I hated the lack of controllers at the time and the screendoor effect which ruined the visual aesthetic when watching Netflix or any video content.Cut to many years later and I decided out of curiosity how much VR technology has evolved. I'm really pleased with the Oculus Quest. The software feels much more polished and smoother. More immersive which is the main point of VR, and I absolutely love the controllers.The screendoor effect is still there and noticeable but definitely improved upon. Watching Netflix or 4K video content is actually enjoyable now. People have complained about the weight and lack of comfort while wearing the Quest but I find it okay. Took a little while to adjust the velcro straps but I am able to wear for a couple of hours without any real discomfort. I guess this will be an issue for some and not for others.Apps wise there are some good offerings on there at launch but very little free content. Expect to pay between $9.99 to $24.99 but there are a few free trials to help decide whether a game or app is right for you. The battery does roughly last as long as the advertised 2 to 3 hours depending on your usage. Gaming burns through the battery a lot quicker obviously. I like the long charging cable which let's you continue to play while charging. There is also an adapter if you wear glasses included in the box.The software requests that you mark out your playing area and does so with the camera sensors. This is genius and stops you from walking into walls or furniture. It also highlights where you have placed the controllers and its then easy to pick them up. The controllers feel ergonomic and intuitive. It takes a little while to get used to the button mapping but you'll be picking up objects in no time.Looking forward to playing with the Quest more over the coming weeks and excited to see what upcoming games and apps will become available.In short, this wont be for everyone and maybe a little too gimmicky and expensive for the very casual VR fan, but this finally feels like how VR was originally intended and is a great experience.

If I go to my friends house I’ll bring my computer with me to run it. Just because I want the little extra kick of seeing people’s avatars in VRChat WHICH  is all I play.

This product failed after several months of use.  The company provides no means of contact besides a customer support email address.  Response to inquiries is typically no response or ""check back later.""  Customer support instructed us to return it for repair after several attempts to reset and update software. Item was replaced with a unit which was defective on arrival.  We were given a return label to ship back the second unit.  The return was apparently lost in shipment.  The companies response was ""check back later.""  This has continued for going on two months. I contacted UPS and was told the shipment was lost, but I have no recourse since Oculus is their customer. I contacted Oculus with the information and Oculus' response for the past several weeks has been ""check back later.  The company apparently has no interest in making this right.

We've had fun taking turns playing games while casting to the TV.  A friend of mine has the HTC Vive, and honestly I couldn't tell the difference in how it looked in-game.  Admittedly the games in the Oculus store are less graphic intensive than the ones on Steam.  As an entry level VR setup, it's totally worth the money, and the 64GB has been more than enough for us so far.  With the latest updates (and the use of a USB-C to USB-C cable and a computer that meets the specs) you can use the Quest as a Rift, so it's really two in one!

Oculus has done a fantastic job of providing a totally new experience at a reasonable cost. The device is intuitive and exciting to use. Even the tutorial on using the controls is a fun experience in a virtual world ranging from launching throwing paper airplanes to launching hand held rockets to controlling a blimp through virtual remote controls.

I’ve been using my Quest daily for almost a week now and I am completely blown away by what Oculus has achieved here. Everything worked flawlessly roughy out of the box (tracking, setup, sound, etc.) The graphics have wowed me despite this being a mobile chipset and the sensation of presence is extraordinary. Comfort could be improved but this is mainly due to the weight of the device. Battery lasts a satisfyingly long time and it can still be played while charging if necessary.

I've been waiting to get this for a while. Yes, the games are fun. But for me, it's the videos. Since I'm home so much from the pandemic, it's nice to just pop this on and take a trip to the beach. Plus my friend has one so we can play games together and do rec room, and get on a call via the headset while in it. The visual quality is a lot better than I anticipated as well.Yes, it could be a little lighter, but they are working on that. And, I get a little motion sick in some videos, but I have motion sickness in general. Nothing too bad though, it's barely noticeable unless I play for a while.Definitely one of my best buys of 2020 (not including toilet paper and sanitizer :p)

Im a game developer and this was the best VR hardware I have used. The cable-less factor is a huge relief. It’s worth the compromise in performance. Also the resolution and frame rate are satisfactory but I believe in the future clarity and blurriness from hardware limitations will eventually be significantly better.

But with the link cable, I can play Rift and SteamVR games no problem! Oculus needs to include the cable with this headset... paying extra for it is really lame.Controllers are good, but the battery covers keep sliding off.

The versatility of the quest is awesome. The one downside is that there are pc VR games I would like to play but as of now I haven't been able to because you can only play what is on the quest store. However, if you side load games and other content, it makes the quest so much better. I have not tested out the new link capabilities that allow PC VR games to be played.

Support was horrible about this and would not overnight a new controller so I'm returning. Update, right controller battery is also leaking. Oculus has no phone number so you have to wait until they contact you. Imagine the disappointment for what could be a simple fix e.g. overnight a controller.

Its Christmas day and we unwrapped it, packaging was excellent, both for quality and presentation. I set it up within minutes, which was very easy. We have been playing for about an hour exploring its feature as we are totally new to VR. Initial impressions barring unfamiliarity are that its amazing. The experience is immersive and honesty I'm in to it way more than I thought I would be. Youtube VR was great as well as several other free games and apps we've tried so far. Controller tracking is spot on and they are fairly intuitive to use, headset is comfortable but there is a slight gap by the bridge of the nose where light bleeds through. I haven't fully adjusted it for size as it was exitedly being passed between 3 different people. I have yet to connect it to our PC with the included link cable to test that out but again initial experience so far is genuinely a complete win. Totally satisfied

I did not know the quest existed till i was doing some research. pros:-no wires!-super easy to setup-tracking is amazing-guardian is super cool, switching into the gray mode makes it a lot safer than early headsets where you were blind.-no additional tracking cameras-hand controllers are intuitive and comfortable-games are reasonably priced.-immersion is incrediblecons with caveat:-graphics are a bit cartoonish, but, the immersion is so good that it doesn't matter.I'm very happy with my purchase.

I had a very good experience with VR. This was a remarkable upgrade from gear VR that I had in past.Pros:Good Sense of presence in VR gamesThe games feel real enough although they are running on a mobile processor.Excellent controller tracking.Good build qualityGood battery life and good roomscale trackingCons:Screendoor effect is quite reduced as compared to first gen rift/vive but its still there.The colors dont look as crisp as they look even on a 720p TV.VR movies dont look as good as VR games even the highest resolution ones.Movie watching experience was not good due to weight of the headset and also due to not good enough picture quality for the 1080p movies.I get mild headache when watching VR movies or 2d movies. Surprisingly I dont get any headache while playing VR games like beat sabre or space pirates.Costly VR gamesThis thing is not a replacement for your HD/4K TVs or gaming monitors. It is good for a couple of hours /day or week experience

The oculus quest is a fine piece of equipment for its time.I like the concept of drawing the available area to walk in VR and the headset warning you visually when you're about to cross that boundary. The VR immersion is very good as long as you can actually walk to reach your objective, but immersion breaks a little when you have to teleport to a place further away. The field of view is advertised to be around 90 degrees, however in practice it is a bit less, because the headset is a bit finicky to adjust such that the picture in front of you is not blurry, and even with the best adjustment edges are still blurry. Additionally, pixel density on the screen is not high enough, so that one can clearly see all the pixels. They would have to increase pixel density 10 times to make it barely acceptable, and 100 times to make it decent. This is why I rate it 4 stars instead of 5. Nevertheless, if you imagine that you are looking at the VR world through glasses that have been touched a lot by fatty fingers which makes the image blurry, and the glasses have a fine black grid built in that make the picture pixelated, your brain will be able to extrapolate what the actual experience not mangled by the glasses should look like and you will be able to enjoy the VR experience a lot nevertheless.

My first ever VR experience, and let me tell you, it's super fun, it feels so real, but my only complain is the battery life.. it lasts about 2-3 hours depending on what you do on it, either gaming, videos etc... I'd say videos will last longer but if you're gaming non stop, expect 2 hrs . I love it, my girlfriend wears glasses and it also supports it as well, she gamed so hard and nearly fell lol! That's how real it felt, 9.5 if the battery life was longer I'd rate 10, I highly recommend this , always clean the lenses after use as once it's damaged its irreversible.

I'm 78 years old and had never used VR before and was pleasantly surprised by the wide variety of interesting 360 degree content and its realism. I'm way past ""shoot-em-up"" games but I'm enjoying Bowling, Tennis, Ping Pong, Golf, visits to various cities around the world, Outer Space, climbing Mount Everest, etc., as well as Beat Saver and Racquet NX. My only disappointment so far has been Google Earth. While fascinating to use at a distance, when you get down to street level I expected to see a 360 degree photo of the streets being viewed but, instead, found what appeared to be painted cardboard mockups of each building. I don't think they are, that would have required an enormous effort, but that is what they look like. The headset is as advertised. Very good.

Product is fine. Works well, amazes people in my family, even those non-gamers. However, Oculus actively preventing game developers from offering discounts really pisses me off. While I do not expect a sale like Steam sales, but at the very least, allowing developers to offer discounts will be reasonable. However, Oculus wants to milk early users as much as they can, and they prevent any discounts on any games on the Oculus Quest. My Quest has been lying dormant for a few weeks due to the lack of discounts on games. Yes, I am price-sensitive on games and would appreciate some form of sales/discounts from time to time as the costs of the full price games will add up over time, considering the short length of the games plus this is not my only gaming system. Therefore, I can only give up to 3 stars at this time due to the attitude of Oculus.

So much fun! Been waiting for something like this. It’s going to get better in the future but it is darn good now. Room scale means you can really work up a sweat. I clocked in at 120-130 bpm playing games like Pistol Whip or Creed. Some games are more mellow. Some games fail to live up to a promise of entertaining game play (drunken bar fight made me laugh more thinking about playing it but was a disappointment). Games are affordable. If you play less than 2 hours you can get a full refund. So, if you’ve been holding out to try VR when it is affordable, supported, and accurate this is it. Jump in!

I love this little VR unit and I hope they make it lighter in the future. On the first day of opening the Quest, everything worked wonderfully. A few hours later and one battery recharge I noticed static and breaking of the sound in the right speaker like it had been blown out. I was super disappointed and tried another game and the same thing. I plugged in some headphones and it worked perfectly. I went back to the built-in speaker and the same issue. About 30 minutes later I started another game and everything was magically fixed! I went back to the other games where I heard the staic and distortion and it was also magically not there! My only guess is there is a loose connection somewhere in the headset.

The only reason I bought the quest is because it's currently one of the few VR headsets that can boast true wireless pcvr gaming but this is coming at a cost. Build quality is awful and the controllers are made of cheap plastic that's easy to break and you will likely experience controller drift within the first few months/weeks (get that customer service line ready and expect a lot of bulls**t) also the headset frequently bugs out and losses the environment so you constantly have to retrace your playspace (entirely a software issue and one that actually was introduced in the last few months). I hate the oculus itself, the company behind it, and the company behind oculus and the only reason this thing exists is because nobody else has bothered to make a wireless headset yet.

I have always been enthusiastic about the applications of VR, but do not have a good gaming PC set-up. The quest is a great headset providing the capability in experiencing virtual reality on a budget. Still has 6 DOF and many other great features including the ability to use it with your PC for better performance. Although not much is sacrificed in terms of performance since games through the store have been ported over directly for the quest. All in all I love it and have been able to introduce 5 people to VR over the weekend, all who had a great experience.Cons: slightly front heavy. Battery only lasts for 2-3 hours.Solution: Mount an external battery to the back of the headset. This will act as a counter weight and provide longer sessions.Seller Specific: Product was ordered through Endear direct. They sent me the wrong order and immediately realized and sent a RMA. Incorrect product was recieved on Saturday and mailed back the same day. The correct product was received the following day approximately 24 hours later. Great seller.

This is a good product for newcomer of VR player like me. Wireless experience is essential for VR gaming and cinema, though the resolution is not so great as blur is very common on most of the apps. The battery is another concern for hardcore user like me, 1 hour of PokerVR or 2 hours of BeatSaber for maximum, it depends on the apps you play.Despite the aforementioned problems, Oculus is walking towards the right direction for future development of VR, it would be a dreaming gear for introducing new guys to VR if only there is better resolution and battery duration.

The Oculus Quest is a fantastic device that nearly nails the VR experience. The controller tracking and head tracking are nearly flawless. The graphics, although not what you'll get with a high-end PC, hold up surprisingly well and don't negatively impact the experience for most games. The resolution, one the the most important metrics for immersion, is impressively high for a stand-alone device. Exploring 3D spaces untethered from a computer provides a level of freedom and immersion you can't get on a traditional VR headset. It's hard to express how good this product is for the price. Buy it, show it to your friends, and fall in love with virtual reality. You will not be disappointed.

If your natural focus length is not the average that they build this device for (mine is about 3 mm out) then using this is guaranteed to cause a headache very quickly.Even if the focal distance is perfect for you, the resolution and refresh rate is very low compared to a wired headset.

I was having fun with it for 2 and a half months then the right controller kept spinning out of control. The customer supports only suggestion was that I wrap a rubber band around it and if that doesn't work ask other users what to do. First of all nothing 3 months old should need rubber bands wrapped around it to hold it together or get it to work properly.  second, what kind of customer support is telling you to essentially go ask people that don't get paid to do your job for you. At the end she said ""this tends to happen with beat saber and other games/apps where a swift motion is made"".

I have played almost all launch titles. By buying and testing them out then returning the one i didn’t care for. All of them play pretty good accept boxvr something felt off in that. The tracking is pretty good it gets lost behind your back if you move to slow in some games, or move it to close to your own face. I have not had any problems with the vr slipping off of my face. Now the controllers are awesome love the joysticks the tracking in most games picking up and throwing things feels great. I did have battery case open on me one time in beat saber but other than that they are awesome.  Now the things that stink short battery life on the headset mostly 2 hrs. Then the controllers they take two aa batteries. So you have too buy those every once and a while. The speakers on it are ok I like my head phones better but they add a wire to get choked by.

If you are a basic Vr user and you do not expect to competitively play, then this system is for you. If you already own the PSVR you will notice that the tracking for the oculus quest is EXTREMELY subpar in comparison. I am almost top ten in EVERY beat saber song in PSVR and found that I cannot come close to my scores due to lag and tracking issues.Next, the controllers. If you move too fast or grip too hard the magnetic backing will easily come off. I also found myself hitting the “home” button anytime things get too crazy in game.Again, if you want to max out the capabilities of a system this NOT the system for you.

The quest delivers great user experience with surprisingly good graphics for a wireless headset that doesn't rely on a gaming PC. Set up is easy and fast. The games and apps I've tried so far have been a lot of fun. I think future development will go far beyond entertainment and lead to some really good teaching/training apps. Definitely worth the price.

The product itself is very good.  it is nice not to have any wires tied to you.  You do not need to buy a gaming computer to get the experience.  They do have a cable that is you could connect to a high powered laptop to play games that are not made for the quest.  I have not tried that yet.  Most games that that I have brought have been 1 to 3 GB.  So take that into account as to which Quest you buy.

VR is so underrated. It's a great cardio workout with BeatSaber and a great mental workout with SuperHot. I cannot recommend it enough. The cordless and no PC requirement is a dream. The controllers are odd to get used to, and the only modification I would make is to make the battery case closure more solid than a little magnet. It's easy to slip off as it sits right under the heel of your hand.

I bought this for my 9 year old and he loves it! I had an issue when I forgot my password to the app. Resetting it causes you to have to re-pair the headset but its touchy. Took me a little while to get it working again. Also, the batteries in the hand controls only lasted about 4 hours. Make sure you have replacements close by. My brand new batteries have lasted longer than what came in the box so I'm guessing they were just cheap batteries. In the grand scheme of things, not a big deal. If you can afford the VR, you can afford AA batteries. The phone app is easy to use. Games are more expensive than I expected but my son really enjoys them and they seem to take a while to play so he gets his money's worth.

As someone that has always been interested in virtual reality, this finally convinced me to take the leap. While I had a computer that could support VR before, I did not want to do that because my computer is upstairs and it would be difficult to take with me when visiting family. The all in one set up from the Quest makes it mobile and I can play anywhere in the house. It is not as powerful as the rift, so the game selection is a little bit more limited, but many of the main titles are available, including Beat Saber (the main reason I wanted VR).

AMAZING!!!!! I bought another one because my boys love it just as much! If your a sports fan....boxing,baseball,  football basketball etc.  this is a must own! The facial interface is very, very uncomfortable and prohibited extended use but we ordered an AMVR facial interface and it helps tremendously! The battery life could be better to but if your play or watching something that doesn't require you to move around we just keep it plugged in while we are wearing it. There is also a battery pack that I seen people using when they are not near any power source and they say it extends the battery for 2 to 4 hours doubling the usage time.

First off, love this headset.Pros: portability, full mobility, more than surprisingly solid tracking of both position and controllers. This headset has a surprisingly similar feel to the PC version than to a mobile headset. Reasonable battery life and solid frame rate.Cons: Slightly more front heavy than I'm used to compared to other headsets, this disappears after awhile. In low light you can occasionally lose tracking, but it's highly uncommon. No current way to know your exact IPD adjustment, so some guesswork required.

But clicking on the""ok"" is not working.  I turned the machine off, and then states, ""power off"", and that the controller is not connected.

Screen door effect was way too bothersome . Now this is a standalone headset running on a cellphone processor and can provide amazing VR experiences? I’m in . The screen is great quality and they are releasing a feature soon to be able to connect to a gaming pc to run games from there. Honestly the best VR experiences for the price .

Managed to place the order when the quest was in huge demand and finally got the order after nearly 3 weeks of waiting. Guess the virus is putting a huge strain on manufacturing and logistics. Noticed that there is a dead pixel on the left eye. I really don't want to return it now and wait for an eternity to get a replacement, moreover it's hardly visible except in dark loading screens.The quest is a pretty great VR product that can operate as a standalone headset and can also be tethered to a gaming pc for some serious VR stuff.

I grew up playing the original NES and was fanatic about video games up until the Xbox 360. I got older, responsibilities mounted, and I had lost interest. I still kept up with the tech, but honestly I was mostly interested in the academics of it. I tried an HTC vive at a fun center and was impressed enough to go out and buy a VR headset. The team at Oculus nailed it; I mean, they absolutely nailed it. The games are incredibly immersive, and there are many educational apps as well. I feel like a kid again. I’m building a new computer so that I can take advantage of the higher graphics and games exclusive to the oculus rift (by using the oculus link cable). It is shocking that you can get this kind of tech for $400.

No tethered headset can compare to the pure freedom the Quest offers. Simply turn it on and jump back in wherever you left off. VR was never about graphics, it's about the freedom to immerse yourself in another world. It's about the freedom to play games that are physically impossible. It's about the freedom to watch Netflix on an IMAX size screen. They are squeezing more out of this processor than I thought possible. The games Oculus allow into the store have a high bar to jump and I agree with their ""only the best"" approach.Obviously you can't compare the Quest's computing power to a gaming PC, but who wants to turn one on, let alone be tethered to it! Nevertheless, the screen is excellent and you can only marvel that they are squeezing so much out of the same processor as the Samsung S8. I think when historians look back, the Quest will be seen as the first real VR headset.Freedom and immersion to explore world we can only imagine. That's what we always wanted from VR.

I purchased this Janurary 29th, and in just one month I lost 20 pounds from over 120 hours of workouts in various apps such as Beat Saber and Super Hot. This being said, I believe a hardware issue has developed. It seems that after an brief time of playing, both controllers lose their tracking and float in space. It makes playing certain games rather difficult and frustrating. I heard Oculus support was rather not up to standard, and I have tried many different solutions to try and fix the issue.

I’ve played the hottest on the quest, from super hot and pistol whip, to Vader Immortal chapter one, and throughout all of my games it has run smooth with little to no errors. The only complaint I have is that due to the system limits, the games don’t have very good graphics and are very short.

If you have never experienced VR before this is the perfect introduction. the quality of the craftsmanship and the range of games will draw you into the emerging world of VR. If you are worried about motion sickness the games and apps are rated to give you a comfort level in order to build up you VR ""legs"".  You can start of with something like Wander which essentially drops you into Google street view so you can be on the Mattehorn while sitting on your couch. Then you can work your way up to more fully immersive and vertigo inducing games such as Climb where you are a rock climber actually climbing virtual mountains and the drop is stomach wrenchingly  realistic.I highly recommend this to anyone even remotely interested in VR

Facebook has just the thing.  This thing puts you in a different world and pretty much a better one because it makes you work mentally and physically for everything.  That is a great thing and this is a lifechanging and perhaps worldchanging device.  It really does suck you out of current reality and into another one without external chemicals.  Not bad.

Well received by the teenage / college age crowd. Many hours spent on these.  Many others have used it - lots of positive feedback. As a parent I like the feature where the device learns the room so the user doesn't beat up the walls or fall over a chair.Plus - it is absolutely HILARIOUS watching people play games with this thing on!

This feels revolutionary first time I used it I was so flustered it’s just incredible to see how far technology has come.Draw back the quest lacks processing power to run high end games but they are making a way to connect the quest to your laptop or computer to run them soon.I don’t recommend it for kids cause the stuff is delicate in the sense that it’s all hard plastic and not very reinforced like the controllers so if they drop something will likely become damaged.Keep a mental note that all the tables you see are fake don’t try to lean on one 😂Edit: the games aren’t diverse and because the quest doesn’t have a way to connect to a pc yet it’s enjoyment is heavily limited.

This headset is amazing, yes it has slightly lower graphics but i found that it’s pretty unnoticeable when your in an immersive experience such as the plank or beat saber. All in all this is a no brained and a must buy, great to get friends in the headset and watch them freak out, I do recommend looking for disposable face masks if your going to have multiple people use it, I bought a pack of 100 for $25 and keeps my headset clean.

I own a PSVR and a quest and I can tell you that quest is not comfy but it's more convenient to use due to :1) stand-alone (you don't need a PC/console to run it) and2) no wire is needed.Saying that expect to get a VR face (just google how it will leave marks on your face) due to the flaw of the design. This can be overcome by adding weight (like it doesn't need more weight) or using vive deluxe audio strap ($100). Saying all that I still love my quest and hope the future release overcome this issue.PS: if you got one you might want to get AMVR grip for controllers

Returned after using for a few hours as I could sense the addictive power of this technology. I have no doubt that VR is the opioid of the future. People will crave their their virtual world just like addicts crave painkillers today. Young and old will spend endless hours detached from reality, isolated from each other. Governments and society will eventually realize that a technology-induced dopamine kick is no different than chemically-induced one. Efforts to regulate will be too little too late, as VR will have permeated every facet of our lives and Oculus (Facebook) will have monopolized people's virtual identities.

Truly the next step in VR.  Can be worn on its own and played anywhere, or tethered to a gaming PC so you can play more demanding games.  Sadly, if you already have a VR library, you have to repurchase your games for this device.  The screen has a low refresh rate, which led to motion sickness for me (though it might not for you).  If you are wanting to get into VR, I cannot think of a better device.  But if you already have a gaming PC with an established VR library (and don't feel like buying all your games a second time), the Rift S is an excellent alternative.

I love it, played over 200 hours total and its great, a few minor issues I had with it solved with a bit more money.1. Super front heavy - nothing a sweatband streched over the head cant solve, and there are many very affordable solutions and others more expensive and more comfortable.2. The built-in face cover is terrible, no way around that, it hurts the skin and absorbs sweat way too much which makes it very unhygienic, the solution for me was a different face cover from ""vrcover"" which is a kind of leather cover, much softer and nicer on the skin and absobs zero sweat wich makes it very easy to clean.Other than that its fantastic and if you're willing to spend some time on learning how to sideload which is quite easy now, you can do a lot of great things with this!

I was pairing the Quest with the Oculus App and all of a sudden the Quest started updating itself and I can no longer pair it again with the App, not until I switch it off for more than 15mins. (switch off and turn it back on immediately did not work)I thought everything is ready since I can finally pair it with the Oculus App but here come with the Wifi issue. The Quest keeps dropping out (and unpair with the App) and cannot search for any networks so I am pretty sure it is not about weak wifi signal as I saw nothing on the Quest. Googled it and saw quite a lot of people having the same issue. I have already submitted a support ticket to Oculus and I hope they could return a new device to me and bear the shipping cost.

What matters is that there is now a VR device that provides unbelievable experiences without being tethered to another device. Without the need of a 500$ PC or a 300$ console attached to it.Between the technology - the 6DoF, the tracking, the controllers - and the games - Robo Recall, Beat Saber, etc. - this is a fantastic entry point for those interested in VR.

As far as vr headsets go, I have to say this is currently the best by far. The ability to not have a computer and cables alone is worth it. Not to mention the fact of price or stock fit.

I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone and everyone. Plus, if you still want to use it with your pc you can thanks to the oculus link update! The only thing I recommend getting with this headset is a power bank if you plan on using it for more than 2 hours at a time, but in all honesty I feel like 2 hours is a good session that you can have a break after.

I tried VR a few times in the past but the need to be tethered to a computer with cables was always a bit of a deal breaker for me.  The quest is amazing with the level of performance is can fit into a  standalone headset! Full freedom of movement, take it with you anywhere, pick it up and be playing something 30 seconds later. These are are the things that make it appealing and approachable now. I love it and so do my wife and kids. Well worth the price of adminision compared to an Xbox or PS4.

A true step up from the traiditonal VR headset, the wireless / PC less feature makes a huge difference. Now anyone can enjoy VR without worrying about buying a $500 GPU, and taking all the sensors and their PC with them every they go. just strap on and play.One of The most impressive things was that, when you set your play zone, the headset keeps recognizes the area based on the camera feed, so next time when you put it on, the play zone is automatically set.

Perfect VR headset. Works mobile, I can bring it to school, a friends house, etc. with no hassle. No cameras or sensors to set up, all in one headset. The hand tracking feature is amazing and I hope to see more games on this system soon. Highly recommended over PC connected VR Headsets. Extremely comfortable and the graphics are extremely well for the weight and ram. The memory is perfect since most games are under a GB anyway, and you can just uninstall unused games. Definitely the best VR experience I've had.

I had to return mine because it had a weird permanent glare in the lens, almost like a stain. It wasn’t very strong and obvious but it still irritated me. On the other hand, the screen was okayish for gaming but not so much for videos. The videos were grainy and since you see “god rays” around white text on the dark background it was hard to watch with subtitles. I’m giving it 4 because overall they made it possible to have a decent standalone VR experience and the tracking was great (anyone who played with older VR sets would agree). So overall I think it will not replace your game console or TV but it’s still good to have it and start experiencing this new technology.

A definite win for Oculus, they really knew what they were doing with the Quest. The controls, the graphics, the roomscale, everything is absolutely great. The only nitpick I have is the headset itself which is a little front heavy, meaning at times the headset may dig into your cheekbones and push against your forehead which will leave some marks and some soreness after playing for a while. The setup was quick and easy and I got right into playing within 10 minutes. If you've been looking for a VR headset and don't want to worry about the hassle of getting it setup, the Quest is the one for you. No regrets on purchasing.

I purchased a quest to try out the wireless experience for VR, and I already own a Oculus rift CV1 from 2016.  Considering this is about half as much as I paid for my original rift, and that this doesn't need a computer, I cant recommend it enough.  The only downside is the graphics quality.  The graphics are impressive considering they are running on mobile hardware, but they dont really compare to an expensive gaming PC, but that shouldn't be a surprise.  The tracking quality is probably better than my rift, and is similar to the HTC vive, from my experience.

Oculus Quest offers the VR experience everyone has been waiting for. While it sacrifices graphical fidelity in some parts, what it gets back in trade is an unrivaled level of freedom in VR gaming. The headset has a battery life of roughly 2 to 2 1/2 hours, which is pretty convenient because average gaming sessions in VR do not normally last that long. After owning this headset for about two months, I can easily that I am very satisfied with this product as my very first investment into VR gaming.

This headset is so good, its crazy. They've managed to pack a crazy amount of tech into such a small package, and it works so well. Its able to run all the killer apps and then some. SUPERHOT in particular is virtually identical to its P.C. counterpart. And the tracking is near flawless. If you already own a PSVR I would strongly recommend picking up a Quest. Also, you can do custom songs on beat saber. Also the lack of a cable makes every experience so much more immersive. 7/5, would recommend.

Other than the fact that the headstraps are a pain to get right, everything is just great.Update: I've had this headset for 3 months now, and it changed my life. I now attract double the women that I used to before getting the headset (yes, I can make these claims because 2×0=0) ;)The problem I had with comfort when I first got it was easily solved with a headstrap from a random mobile vr headset I had laying around.

This is my first step in VR. After having it for over a month, I can say It is the perfect entry point for people who don’t have a powerful gaming pc/laptop or a ps4 for psvr. Since it’s a self contained unit, it’s perfect to take with you to show your friends and family whenever and wherever. Setup is easy and self explanatory, but you’ll probably need a teen or adult to assist children. The only draw backs that I’ve come across are the WiFi has trouble staying connected from time to time, the tracking can be slightly inaccurate at times, and its heavier than you’d think on your head.

Make sure to buy a link cable if you have a VR Ready PC.  This is probably my favorite buy of the year, I use it practically everyday, and if you are on the fence about buying this just take the plunge.  The quest is so much more than a gaming system, its hard to explain but everything in VR just feels more interactive and personal.  Want a big screen TV? The Quest can stream media and make you feel like you are at the cinema.  You can even watch media in a cinema setting with your friends in VR with an app, it's awesome.

Highly convenient when used as a stand-alone, just put it on and play!We’re only 7 days in and 3rd party PCVR streaming options such as ALVR are working impressively well (admittedly with the need for tweaking & optimising wifi connection between PC and headset). This almost makes wired sets like the Rift S redundant. Sure, latency will never be as low as wired, but visual quality with tweaked settings is breathtaking.I’ve found a good setup for ALVR is to have a dedicated wifi router (no other devices connected) next to my PC set to 5GHz with 80 MHz channel width (on a empty channel), then start a “mobile hotspot” from the PC and connect directly to that with the headset.

Therefore, I made a counterweight to solve the problem.2) I have to dry out the facial interface after taking off the headset (I sweat a lot while playing beat saber).

This is a revolution. The headset which brings VR in mass-market. Whomever you are — buy it and enjoy it.There is only one thing which I had a problem with — charging. My unit turning on/off sometimes by its own. Oculus agreed for replacement, however, I cannot send them back my original unit, so I will have to live with that issue.Otherwise — this is gamechanger and it is a great value

Dont get me wrong the Oculus quest is an amazing console for its price. Theres nothing like it. But thats what it is, a console, and if your not willing to constantly spend money for games on that console, then you can get bored of the games you do have.

Great product, smooth experience, great tracking of both head and controllers.Wire-free VR is fun and liberating.Graphics quality is borderline, due to the weak 835 processor, but I knew that before I ordered it. Luckily, it doesn't ruin the immersion, and many of the games are really cool (but sometimes a little too short and/or expensive).Quest is currently in a category of its own. There is no other affordable standalone wire-free VR headset in the market. It the best (and only) choice for entry to VR.

The oculus quest provides the a VR that was, until recently, only seen in science fiction.  The experiences you can have with this head set are beyond describable.  I have had previous experience using an HTC vive at the local vr arcade.  The experience is very comparable.  Some of the high end graphic games don't look as great in the quest but most of the games look almost the same  AND you're not tripping on chords.  The headset is a little heavy and adjusting the straps takes getting used to but overall the quest blew all my expectations out of the water.  It is truly an amazing piece of technology.

This product is way way better than I expected. I thought the graphics would be completely terrible, but they aren't. I thought the tracking wouldn't be that good, but it is pretty fantastic. I would say the biggest cons are 1. heavy on the face, but you can mitigate that by attaching a battery brick to the back of the headset. 2. the audio is good, but missing a bit of bass, and everyone around you can hear it. But you can get headphones, like the mantis ones for PSVR or use any 3.5mm headphones.

I don’t normally write reviews, but this thing is just so awesome that I had to. This headset is like the Nintendo Switch of VR right now. It doesn’t need a computer or wires, and it is completely standalone. The only drawback to this, is that the graphics aren’t as good as an oculus rift, or any other big setup VR headset. However, that is a given if you’re going to get a stand-alone, and I was prepared for that.

Bought as a Christmas gift for my son. He loves the device. So device is 5 stars. However, Oculus Customer Support is an endless loop. Online support chats disconnect and online support requests are not responded to in their stated 48 hour timeframe. 0 Starts for Oculus Customer Support - that gets me to the 2 star average. If you do not have a question for the support center or a problem with you device which needs support ---- this VR device is awesome.

I really enjoyed my quest.my computer isn't strong enough for PCVR, so the quest is great for me.I tried also my friend's Rift s, and out of the two I would recommend the quest, even for pcvr :the option for portability is nice,you cap paly pcvr games, WITH NO CABLES at all, (using virtual desktop for example).overall great product, but buy the quest 2 instead. 100$ cheaper, and better.

Simply AMAZING! Beat Saber is so much fun with no cables. Best option for social VR by far...invite friends and cast to the TV and have a blast. Plus...with the Link option you can be in rift mode.I can't recommend this enough...5 stars...no it deserves way more than 5 out of 5!!!Only thing...get a aftermarket facial interface as you will sweat in the original.

The great thing about the Oculus Quest is the immersion you feel right off the bat. Younger kids like 12 and below are harder to teach and pick up on what to do. I have wasted much time trying to get them to even get going with Beat Saber, so save your time and tell them it for kids 14 and up. Otherwise it has been a very positive experience and a great workout. Can’t wait for more great games.

At $399 the Oculus quest has brought an AMAZING VR experience... My biggest worries getting into such a cheap VR headset was ""What if things are blurry or grainy?"", or ""What if it the sensors don't pick up anything because, maybe it's made cheap?"". Putting on and handling the quest blew me away. Visually it's impressive,  the games and apps all work great, and I've been going at beat saber since I got the thing! I highly recommend this product, and am very happy with all it has to offer.

Long story short if you are thinking of getting into a Oculus. Go for this, cheapest on the market and for paying more then the Oculus Go you get so many more worth while upgrades. Like the games you can get and the second controller for Saber beats. This console has been in my house for 3 months and a day hasn't gone by without it being played.

Amazon offers full refund but no replacement and the price has been raised considerably since i first purchased mine. Oculus,however, is sending me a new one once they receive the defective one.

This vr headset is amazing it is my first one and I'm happy that I waited. There are some down sides to the item but not that bad. For example the game store for it does not have a big verity of games but it will still be updating so it isn't something to dwell on. It can only play for about 2 hours and charge for 2 hours which is a bummer but it helps with breaks. I believe it is worth the money because you don't have to worry about a super computer and the cables on your back. All in all 10/10 would recommend

I was a little skeptical of a stand-alone headset (i.e. no computer with crazy GPU needed), but I ordered one on a whim under the presupposition that I could just send it back if it was lame.

I had it on for 30 minutes and could tell it was going back. I also have a rift s that is going back also because it has fixed lenses and out of my ipd range so everything is blurry, but besides that it is everything this is not.

My daughter is addicted to beat saber. So far she has cracked one of the rings on the controller from dropping it, nothing a little electric tape couldn't fix. I don't like not being able to have multiple accounts, but I got it for her so it's hers anyway. Some games have options for other players. Make sure you have room to play, it can be glitchy if you try an play the wrong kind of game in to small of a guardian area. Casting to a chromecast is the best thing ever, so others can watch.

As a Previous Go owner:Resolution is superb, games have better graphics. With Oculus link, you can play rift games. Screen-door effect lower than go but still a little visible. Controllers have good feature set.Strap is not comfy as go. Weight balance is not centered so you feel pressure around your cheeks.

Since the developers has decided to add a feature that allows users to use the headset on PC (Oculus Link), i just had to give this thing a better review.Probably the most notable downside is the weight of the headset on head, and might be quite uncomfortable for someone. And perhaps the prices of all games on Oculus Store.

Drops wifi connection frequently, limited to the oculus store unless you sideload.  Additional weight makes prolonged play uncomfortable.  Otherwise pretty good.

The games are enjoyable with Beat Saber being my favorite.

This is a pretty good product. It's more affordable than most VR headsets, and it doesn't require a PC to run. The built-in tracking helps reduce setup time as well; you just put the controller wrist straps on, put the headset on, turn it on, and you're ready to play.

I remember when the best and cheapest VR headset was the Oculus Rift, for the same price as this, which still needed a good PC to operate. This setup, the Quest, is an experience as good if not better than that, quite literally no strings attached. I thank myself for buying this every time I use it.

Bought this VR for my young son and for someone who isn’t into video games I have to say I am impressed with quality of this device. I’ve tested the Rift a few months before and this portable VR is almost as good as the Rift. For me, I like the Quest better because it is portable, no wires to trip on. I just wish there were more games appropriate for 6/7 year olds.

The Quest is an amazing device that makes VR within reach. The main problem is a lack of content. Im a believer and know its a matter of time for the developers to learn how to make great content for it. That being said, Beat Saber could last you a year of play, especially if you're using it to lose weight.

 My son is in the midst of a bone marrow transplant for a multiple-relapsed leukemia. After 7 weeks of hospitalization, in the same room with the same surroundings, Oculus Quest has been an incredible break from this same-sights, same-sounds reality. It's amazing!We clear the room, pushing the hospital bed to the side and then after setting our ""safe zone"" in which he can walk, he is immediately transported to a new world. He hasn't been interested in getting up to go on walks because that feels like work, but to put on the Oculus Quest gear and go scuba diving, or engage in a lightsaber duel, gun battle, or just explore Machu Pichu, he will get up until his legs are too exhausted to go on. The therapists and physicians are blown away at the treatment benefit of Oculus Quest in this environment!Oculus Quest just works. Once the boundaries are set (where the Quest shows a black and white view of the room and you can trace out where the floor and walls of your safe zone are) you are free to walk around (not just look around) inside your virtual world. You get sucked in and can easily forget that the new world you are in is not real. I've tried to sit on the virtual furniture more than once. The graphics are not high resolution, but they are high enough. It's obvious that with increased computational power and development, this is the future of gaming and probably even of remote work and online classes/meetings. But for now, I am so grateful for this technology to help my son get out of the hospital room even while he is confined to it, to be a distraction where we can travel the world and even jump into a galaxy long long ago far far way.

I didn't buy my Quest through Amazon but I just have to say its my duty as an Amazon citizen and fan of this platform to say...it rocks.About a year ago I spent a little money to get my home computer propped up enough to run Microsoft Mixed Reality (MMR) - realizing that a Vive or a Oculus would have probably been a better experience and that I was just ""tasting"" the experience.  I didn't have the cash to layout for a hefty graphics card, beefy computer and to buy the visors.  The MMR experience was ""okay"" but being tethered was a pain and I can't really say I was floored by the experience.  Also I feel Microsoft has moved on and is abandoning (shock) the platform.  But you know what?  That's okay because Quest is here.The Quest is something special.  I was up and playing in 5 minutes.  No loading drivers, no fiddling with multiple cables, no ensuring my drivers are up to date, and no crossing my fingers that I can run that next game.  Every member of the family is wowed by the experience.  The out-of-box experiences are simply put....awe inspiring.  Even setup is a technological wonder.  It makes me giggle...it makes my kids dance...it even got my wife to dance with a virtual robot.  Heck, my brother bought one based on my cooing and HIS family is now enamored and addicted.Pros:- No wires- Room scale experiences- It just works; setup is actually in itself awe-inspiring.  Somehow the device keeps track of your play area...by you pointing your controller on the ground and painting where you will play while you wear the visor (i.e. built in camera).  If you have anything close to a 6x6 area (or greater) you have room for a ""room-scale"" experience without tether.- Built in sound (or bring your own headphones)- You can connect a controller if a game needs it (got an old xbone sitting around?  use its controller)- Comes with a glasses expander.  Speaking of glasses...I can wear mine without difficulty with the Quest...but there is an expander.  I scratched the heck out a pair of glasses with my MMR device.  No problems here.- The visor hugs your face like an infant alien.  Pretty comfortable for me.  Maybe after an 60-90 minutes I'll adjust or take a break.  Also...Built-in adjustment for horizontal pupil alignment. (again not all VR visors have this - looking at you cheap MMR Lenovo device).  That helps if you were blessed with ""non-standard"" pupil distances.- You can connect to a VR ready PC with the new Link capability and play PC based RIFT games (say whaaaat?).  That expands capability if you want to have an ambilocal cord experience with the already existing RIFT game ecosystem.- You can cast to Chromecast compatible devices what you are playing.- You could, if you wanted, side load games (i.e. Minecraft for example)- You can watch 3D videos from Oculus, YouTube VR or others.- The visor has mic....in social games you can TALK TO PEOPLE and they talk to you while you play say, a game of table tennis.- There are at least 50-100 experiences/games out of the box (wasn't the case for MMR) from shooters, scary experiences, meditative experiences, movies, connection to YouTube VR, etc.  More to come for sure.- in 2020 purportedly hand tracking (i.e. you will not need the controllers for some experiences at some point) is coming out.- Quest is selling so well at present its making hardware sales for Facebook soar.  Must better than other visors.  These hard sales means more interest in the platform by developers and thus more games being ported/created for the experience- I believe you can side load not just games but content (like videos) but have not explored thatCons- Hmm...hard pressed- You will eventually want to buy some games.  Games are little more expensive than Oculus Go but not overly expensive at between $10-30 a pop. $30 for the more meaty games.- Yes, graphics are a bit muted compared to the water-cooled behemoths used to drive traditional VR...but your not going to care because the experience is THAT good.- Personally, I like longer running games (like 40+hours).  You are dealing with a phone-based processor so...I may have to wait a while for Skyrim on Quest (ha ha).- $400; cost of a low end PC- Chromecast...I don't have one but I hear if you have a supported device it is stable(ish).  Streaming to my Android via Oculus app works for about 3 seconds for me then freezes pretty consistently.  I see this pretty common.  So, jury is out on this one feature for me unless they fix it at some point.Hope this helped somebody.  Enjoy!

I find it so hard to believe that the occulas quest is getting reviews that say how great and wonderful it is ????? It's not great at all ! Some people must be living very sheltered life's ! Or are just trying to make themselves feel good psychology after buying a bum item ! First off the head set is very heavy and extremely uncomfortable to wear for longer than 15 minutes at a time . The head strap is a cheap piece of crap ! It looks just like a jock strap ! Super uncomfortable to wear ! Occulas knew this head strap was crummy but included it anyway ! You have to order a separate head strap upgrade that costs around 35 $$$ and up ! After paying $ 400 for something this is what you get ! A jock strap ! Now you have to she'll out even more money ! This shows that the occulas quest devdevelopers are money grubbing jerks to do something crooked like this . Ok here we go ! You have to be a member on Facebook to use the occulas quest ! If your not using Facebook then you won't be using your occulas ! The developers don't give a #@$$#@&+(@# about bringing you great VR games and experiencing great  VR . All they really care about is the advancement of Facebook ! And making alot of money ! There is so much extreme infasis on social media and teaming up with friends and going on Facebook n stuff . If your a gamer who likes a one player that's me ! Type of gaming experience well you can almost for get about it ! I hope you just won the lottery  because your going to need it to buy there totally overpriced games ! Iam a very long time video gamer lover ! Going back to Atari 2600 and the Nintendo NES etc . !  The pricey games for the occulas quest plane and simple is ,, there games really suc big time ! And iam really very easy to please when it comes to gaming. I've played alot of games that other people hated but I felt that they were still decent and fun games to play ! But these occlus games are just awful ! Besides costing way to much  the graphics absolutely stink ! I was expecting a incredibly awesome 3d  . VR  bad ass immersive blow your mind gaming experience ! But ! Noooooooooooooooooo ! These games don't even look as good as playstation one games ! Not even close! And there really , really short , time wise that is ! Finish your game in one day or less ! Plus most of the games have glitches and alot of bugs in them as well . Some of the so called games are not even games at all ! Just forced tours of a location or a demo . You can ask for a refund on a game you purchased with in 14 days and played less than 2 hours but good luck on trying to figure out how to do that ?????? !!!  Occulas makes it fairly easy to spend and buy things from them but very difficult to get a refund!!! It's like pulling teeth ! Or just no information available to read the instructions on how to do it ! This is another sign that the occulas developers are just money grubbing crooks that are only concerned about raising there bottom line ! $$$$$$$$$ the free games are crappy as well ! Just demos and low end junk !most of the free stuff is better on YouTube ! Oh ! I almost forgot ! The battery only lasts about 2 hours !!!!! And takes a pretty long time to charge ! PlayStation 4 games n stuff are a thousand times better than better than occulas quest !  PlayStation two games are a thousand times better than the occulas quest !!!! I hope in the future something better is developing ! This is really disappointing ! And sad !

I've been on this ride from the beginning of CV1 days, I followed the Kickstarter but wanted to wait for a consumer product so I didn't join in. When the CV1 was out, I planned out my PC build as I was going to start messing around with VR dev work and had an idea in my head of how I would find the VR experience from seeing videos online. I thought VR would be revolutionary and once I got my hands on the CV1, the fun began. I enjoyed games like DCS and Onward the most and messed with the software and hardware settings as much as possible. There was a major issue I ran into during CV1 however that has yet to be addressed and it's one of visual clarity. Even after having gone through other headsets like the Oculus Go, Samsung Odyssey +, and now this Oculus Quest, I find myself at the mercy of tech that just doesn't seem to be quite there.The Quest is running two OLED panels with the same panel resolution as the Ody+, which while impressive, does not rectify the clarity problem. Worse still is the fact render resolution is not the same as the panel resolution. Having messed with render resolution on PCVR, I can say that rendering below the native resolution of a screen does not produce good results as you might imagine. If I'm not mistaken, it is also a good idea for PCVR to render slighting above the native screen resolution to better deal with the issues that come up when transferring the image the panels give though the lenses and into your eyes, not to mention the better perceived sharpness rendering higher than the panel produces in general. The Quest uses software workarounds to deal with its limited hardware and this is quite understandable. Having messed with the Ody+ and finding the resolution still not good enough with a PC behind it, I had to temper my expectations. What did I find?Fit/finish: The materials and design remind me of the CV1 and this is a very good thing for me given I really found myself loving most everything about the CV1. You have solid feeling plastics all round with a solid implementation of a matte finish(thank God as I despise glossy plastic with a passion). The face interface is cushiony and easy to remove for maintenance and they stayed with the thin and light baseball cap headband design. While I didn't have an issue with the weight and played long sessions, I did find CV1 had a better fit on my head but I was overall happy. It's good Oculus kept most of the work for this product in house as compared to the Rift S as it shares many similarities with CV1 which is great.Screens/Lenses: All good things come to an end and for this product, this is the most painful aspect of my experience. With expectations limited and hesitation removed, I decided to give this headset a shot. While I did purchase a PC for VR, the need for high fidelity graphics is not really on the current table of wants. I purchase the power to simply push as many pixels as possible given my initial reading of how VR headsets would work, you're magnifying the screens after all to cover a large FOV compared to your standard monitor. I could care less if games used PS2 graphics, I just want some measure of clarity that's acceptable and this won't be the same for everyone. What I found was still a pixelated/blurry experience, Oculus software magic didn't overcome the hardware limits enough here sadly. We are gaining a good jump from CV1, this is the same resolution the Ody+ and Vive Pro use after all, but you must also know that we are not dealing with an RGB stripe arrangement found in LCD headsets. The lack of an RGB stripe arrangement, as only currently found in OLED form on the PSVR if I'm not mistaken, combined with the limited hardware, gives you a sub optimal visual experience. Things that are close are fuzzy and pixelated while things moving just a bit out become a blurry mess quite quickly. There are ways game designers can work within these limits and still produce great experiences like Creed and BeatSaber. I found I could enjoy myself with good game design but same as with CV1, I just could not ignore constantly looking at a world that made me think I forgot to put on my contacts/glasses, but I kept on playing. In comparison the the CV1, the lenses seem to do a better job at handling god rays and we are dealing with OLED screens which produce great contrast. Even with OLED screens, true black isn't something to expect but we still gain quite a noticeable contrast boost vs LCD. I am happy to see the Quest also includes manual IPD which is truly a dick move to have removed from the Rift S BTW. Given my high IPD, I was able to set up the lenses exactly where they needed to be and unlike the Go, I did not suffer almost immediate eye strain. We are dealing with a lower refresh rate on the Quest but I can happily say this did not cause discomfort for me so I see it as an absolute win given the limited hardware.Tracking: I came in not expecting much with the tracking outside the volume the cameras cover and had no surprises in this regard as I witnessed my hands snap and float around. One area I however held hope for was for tracking performance inside the cameras view. I found Jasons defense of their move to inside out tracking on the PC side quite worrying but I still see inside out as a necessary sin given the added simplicity it brings to mobile and the need for VR to get off the ground. Having played Creed, Robo Recall, and Beat Saber the most, I noticed my hands experienced small shaking and unstable tracking from time to time. This also happened outside of games as I messed around in the home enviroment and with the guardian system. I attempted resets, switching the tracking setting, and different rooms but this never truly went away. My experience with the guardian system has also been hit and miss with the Quest sometimes remembering the room and other times not. I did have my living room mostly blank but Oculus support assured me this wouldn't be an issue. While I could not correct the instability before I returned my headset, I was still able to enjoy multiple games for the most part but given my solid experience with CV1 tracking, my impressions were hampered. There's a good chance this wouldn't be as much of an issue if you're new to VR so keep that in mind, the overall experience might make up for it. For sure, my experience with the Quest tracking was much better than WMR so I'm happy they added the extra cameras and placed them as they did.UPDATE: Oculus has updated the headset a couple times since this review and tracking both inside the cameras visible area and outside has seen good performance gains, It's still not as good as the 3 camera CV1 experience I had but a solid update no less. The headset also seems to do a better job at remember my multiple guardian setups.Sound: I've dealt with some high end gear, gear many would deem ludicrous to own and I'd agree with them. From high end headphones to high end in ears, I've tried some highly regarded products such as the Stax 009, Sony MDR-EX1000, and JH Audio 13. The only speakers I've owned where JBL 305P MK11's(dang glossy plastic) with the accompanying subwoofer but currently have Airpods and Philip L2's I attached a bluetooth module to with command strips and a short Fiio cable, it works what can I say. The CV1 over ear implementation surprised me as it provided a well rounded solution with good bass for those in game times you needed it. The Quest solution is quite frankly a major disappointment for me and unlike inside out tracking, I don't see this as a necessary sin given how easy the CV1 solution was to use. I'd simply guess this is mostly to cut cost rather than remove friction for the customer but there's no way for me to know for sure. While you miss out on much of the bass, you do get fairly good positional sound so all is not lost. I've seen people DIY solutions to imitate the CV1 solution on the Quest but really I would have preferred it if Oculus at least offered an in house solution to this problem.UPDATE: I tried using IEM through the audio ports and the ports are noisy which is disappointing.Conclusion: The choice to go with OLED screens while surprising to me given the cost considerations they were working with, provide good contrast but worse clarity. I might have personally preferred LCD given the trade offs unless of course they decided to pay the cost of RBG OLED on their end. Inside out tracking while limited in performance, has proven to be a necessity in my experience with this device. There are no extra boxes or wires to manage and friction is greatly reduced for it. The controllers are nicely made if a bit harder to handle given their top heavy nature and battery cover that tends to slide out of place. Compromises are the name of the game and my hope is Carmack and gang continue to push out as much performance and polish as they can because this is truly the best platform currently out to introduce people to VR. You have a wireless and polished all in one package for $399, I'd say it's definitely worth a shot. Given the current Quest specs and my experience, I have a strong feeling Quest 2 will be the version I keep.

Ok if you’re looking to get into VR, I can give you a model comparison so you endup with the right one for you.This is not a paid review, just my honest opinion from experiences with them.Will appreciate if you click if you indeed found this helpful.The Oculus Go is an entry level headset.It does not require a computer to run and is this wireless.Affordable.Would be great for kids under 13.It’s not too complex or high end.Easy to pickup and get the hang of.There are no external cameras so it’s more of a stationary headset which is ironic given its name. (Go as coined in that this headset is wireless, it does NOT need a stand alone computer to tether to.)Will not get you moving around or exercising.Had one controller which is basic and easy however limiting.Can not upgrade. Good to get your toes wet.Not for hardcore gamers. Lighter than Quest by a bit.Samsung Gear Powered by OculusVery affordable.Does not require a computer to tether to.DOES require a smartphone to power it.By not putting all the internal to power it, they were able to make a very cheap and light headset.Will use your phones battery while in use.Phone can not be used while the headset is using it.Requires a compatible phone.Better phone will yield slightly better experience.Not for hardcore gamers. Good to get your feet wet at a cheap price tag if you have a compatible smart phone.Pretty light weight without the phone attached.Oculus Quest-Probably my favorite and best headset for the average person.This is a big upgrade from the two choices mentioned above.This headset has better specs, faster, better screen, visuals/graphics.This headset is ideal for casual gamers.This headset is good for most ages. Adults will appreciate this over the two listed above.The major downside vs. the two above is cost.Quest costs significantly more than the Go and Gear. In my opinion it is worth it for me but it isn’t for everyone.Quest has TWO controllers which ad a bit of complexity for some but make use much more fluid and in depth.Quest had external sensors/cameras that allow it to sense the environment around it.You are able to move and it will be reflected in game. This headset will have you moving and exercising depending on the game/app you’re in. Quest has the ability to define room boundaries as to not run in to or hit surrounding objects or walls.Quest is newer than both Gear and Go.Quest is fairly heavy as it is fairly high specs and is not tethered/powered by a computer or phone. It is wireless but a bit heavier as a result. Added weight did not bother me much but it may to some.Oculus Rift- This is the top of the line most immersive VR experience Oculus offers.This is for hardcore gamers or those where cost is not a factor in deciding on a VR headset. This has all the bells and whistles but at a cost. In my opinion a huge cost, both financially and more importantly to me limitations, mainly in movement and freedom.Rift requires an external computer to power it.This requires cords and as a result is not wireless and limits freedom and movements.It is possible to get tangled when fully immersed.You must have a fairly high end PC to run this well. A dinosaur pc you got on Black Friday probably won’t cut it and will not have fluid or quality gameplay.This would be a good choice for a hardcore gamer who already has a high end pc and would not need to purchase a computer just to power this headset.The graphics are stunning and your experience can be upgraded slightly by upgrading the pc powering it.To me I did not like how it’s not something you could just throw on quickly and you’re in the VR world. You had to make an effort and set aside time not just jump in and out for a few minutes. Not something you could travel with unless there is a high end pc near you.Overall the most graphically stunning and realistic.Storage size/GB’s - I have been asked which storage size I’d recommend. I can say that the lower storage will be fine for most. For those who get lots of games/apps, may want to upgrade storage size.To me personally, I’d probably get the smaller storage and just use the savings towards a future headset in a few years once they have improved drastically. Just my opinion.Please remember to click if you found this helpful

Was so interested in the VR world, given I play Playstation games and pc games once in a while. I wanted to totally immerse myself in the VR world and escape, Similar to that of Ready Player One. The first time I tried this thing, was absolutely mind blowing. Sure not the smoothest of gameplay, and very similar to strapping a smartphone that’s heavy over your face, but in regards to playing this for no joke 30 minutes, I had a severe ocular migraine, the hospital wants to call it a small T.I.A. Or mini stroke, but whatever it was it wasn’t a cool experience. I have had them as a kid in the past and now that I’m 25, I thought they’d be gone by now since I had been headache free for 2 years. Now all of a sudden it has come back and this time with a vengeance. Anytime I strap this puppy on, I get an immediate headache. I do not recommend for anyone that has suffered these headaches.

My husband and I bought 2 Oculus Quest sets. We saw a commercial and figured we would get them for Christmas gifts for my daughter and her boyfriend who is a gamer. My son and his wife have systems too but neither couple have virtual reality. My daughters boy friend stated that he has been dying to try Oculus  Rift. He plays on his computer when he isn’t at work. I mentioned to my daughter that there is a “Wireless” one called Oculus Quest. My husband and I bought 2 Oculus Quests to give them as Christmas gifts. Then we were so curious, we sent for a Oculus Quest for ourselves. I have to state how simple it was to set up. We didn’t even need a PC! Just my  I-phone and Wi fi! I downloaded the Oculus Quest AP and followed the easy directions for instal. So easy! My husband and I purchased the 128 GB. Let me tell you, he and I are in our 60s and we are amazed by this. It was like becoming part of the game. We have no words to discribe what this is like. You have to experience it for yourself! ~ We initially had trouble with the “ guardian”. We kept going outside our game perimeter. Then, my husband figured out how this is resolved. You just use the toggle control to bring it toward you. It moves the game in closer, so there is no reason to move outside one’s boundary ( guardian). It took a few times for him to figure that out. That was during the Vader Immortal  game.  Both of us feel like playing Oculus Quest is like entering into another world. I enjoy playing Quill. It is challenging and beautifully done.  I highly recommend Oculus Quest! I cannot wait for Christmas when our children and grandkids will get their sets. I can not wait for them to experience it!  The games are great.

The product is making a noise and the handsets did not work. First I contacted Amazon for support. They said they could not help so they were online chatting with Microsoft Microsoft so they could not help so then they reached out to oculus. Finally Amazon said we are going to send you a link For oculus so you can troubleshoot from there. The link was to the basic Amazon page which was not helpful. I reached out to oculus and they could not do a phone call. My child has autism and cannot read and has difficulty expressing himself. I beg somebody to please call me. They were just online chat which frustrated things because my son could not communicate properly to me and I could not communicate to them. Because I am not a technical person I just said can we please exchange this or send it back for repairs. Ultimately they could not figure out what was going wrong. They said someone would get back to us within six weeks. It is a shame because I have purchased so much from Amazon. Amazon said this is an item they cannot return or exchange it has to go through the manufacture. My son has been withdrawn for about four hours. These sessions last a good 3 1/2 hours with no resolution. It’s very disappointing because I have had such a positive experience with Amazon. I’ve tried multiple times to get back in touch thinking maybe I just reached the wrong person. I am not getting any information back. Just people pushing me two numbers that are not picking up or support that takes weeks to get back to you

This is my third recent VR headset. I also have a PSVR and an original Oculus Rift, so I have some basis for comparison.I wanted this because it's both a standalone headset *and* it can now connect to your PC via Oculus Link, which gives it all the same functionality as the Rift. So it's a clear upgrade in that sense; it just does more than the Rift, being that it can also be used (with its own dedicated apps and games) without the PC, and even when running PC games it does not require external sensors. Since all the wires the other VR systems require are my big pet peeve about VR in general, I thought the Quest would be the perfect solution.And if this is your first experience with VR, definitely prepare to be blown away. Modern VR just in general is almost a life-changing experience, and the Quest is no different. The graphics are to the point where it's easy to immerse yourself in the content. The Quest has a little higher resolution than the Rift and a little lower refresh rate; overall it's kind of a wash IMO. It looks pretty similar to me. But both look great overall.Compared to the PSVR, both are obviously higher quality in terms of the image, although PSVR holds its own and is still more than good enough to immerse yourself in. PSVR also has better lenses than either the Rift or the Quest, both of which have obvious ""god rays"", where the light bounces around and reflects off the inside of the lenses. I had hoped the Quest would fix this issue, but it hasn't. Its lenses do look a little different than the Rift - the light rays are kind of evenly distributed rather than all concentrated in the middle as on the Rift, but there's just as much of it. PSVR doesn't have this at all.There are two medium-sized caveats with the Quest:1) It's uncomfortable! Oculus is going backwards on this. The Rift was comfortable *enough*, but not very much so... I expected the Quest to be an improvement after 4 or so years of extra development. This is a really big issue for VR - it has to be comfortable. And the Quest is just not. It's extremely front-heavy, for one thing, and its head strap seems somehow even less well designed than the Rift's (which was already kind of hacky, with velcro and whatnot). It's meant to go down further on the back of your head and grab the entire circumference of your skull, but in practice it just slides forward no matter what I do. And when it slides forward, it presses really hard on your face.There are accessories you can get to alleviate this, which makes it clear too that it's a real issue (if it weren't, companies wouldn't be profiting from it). But that's an extra expense, and something I'm going to have to use trial and error with some of these products to fix.If you're wondering, the PSVR is very comfortable and it's supposedly the ""low end"" option these days, but I can wear it for hours without even thinking about it. It doesn't press against your face at all. The Quest I can wear for maybe 30 minutes before it's unbearable. Other VR companies need to just copy Sony - they've got it right.2) It's missing any sort of headphones. Again, you can fix this by buying something extra - you can either use regular earbuds (though the cord will probably get in the way) or you can buy special earbuds just for the Quest with short cords. But I feel like this is a major omission - VR just doesn't feel right when listening through speakers. It takes you out of the immersive world. This reeks of cost-cutting - the Rift had some pretty good headphones attached directly to it. The PSVR at least came with a set of special earbuds with the right length asymmetrical cord (I eventually upgraded to something more like the Rift has, headphones attached to the headset side rails, but it at least came with *something* so you didn't need to spend extra money right off the bat).I'm sure I'm getting more critical as someone who's on his third VR headset. But that's the thing - VR should be maturing, and while the Quest is awesome for being standalone *and* PC linkable, in other important ways it's a regression, with extra purchases required to fix its issues. I just expect better at this point, and we all should. These systems are not inexpensive, nor are they new tech anymore. And Oculus is not some tiny little indie company; they are owned by Facebook. (Oh, also? They *really* want you to log in with Facebook now. I tried logging in with just my email address, but they linked my email address with my Facebook account and logged me in with Facebook anyway. You have to manually unlink your account, but you will ""lose access to certain functions"" if you do so.)Still, I'm probably going to end up selling my Rift simply because it doesn't do as much as the Quest. I'll bite the bullet and buy what I need to buy to bring the Quest up to standard (I've already ordered Quest-specific earbuds; some sort of comfort solution will come next). Once I do that, I think I'll be happier with it than with the Rift, especially because I can finally get rid of the rat's nest of cables going to my PC (HDMI and three sensor cables), and only connect the Quest when I need to in order to play PC-based games. That was the original goal; I just thought the out of the box experience would get me there, and it didn't.

To start off i was very impressed with the Oculus Quest. I've never owned a VR headset before even though my PC is capable of handling VR. I hesitated on buying a headset for a long time due to the room tracking sensors. The Quest doesn't need any sensors and has set itself apart from others in this respect. I LOVE the ability this thing has to set up a safe play area almost anywhere, truly a game changer.Headset:The headset is really adjustable and having tested it out with 10+ people now i can say that normal/large/small heads can all comfortably adjust the headset to fit them. I've introduced many of my friends to VR for the first time on this headset and they are blown away by the ease of learning to use the headset and the tutorial. Its a great way for someone to get into VR for the first time. Can't wait to test it on my parents :)Graphics:The graphics are not phenomenal on the headset but keep in mind this is running on its own steam (processing power/battery) and keeping that in mind the graphics are great for what it is. Is it cutting edge graphics? No. But with no wires this headset is truely immersive any everyone i've shown it to has 'forgotten where they are' meaning the graphics are good enough for total immersion in the VR world. When my friends take it off they look like they just came out of the Matrix ""holy s***"" is the top thing i hear when they take it off and i'd agree.BatteryThe battery claims are true. 2 hours is normal on a charge but you can charge while playing so if you really wanted to play longer you could connect a battery pack to yourself and after a full week of use 2 hours is normally plenty for me. For what this thing is capable of, 2 hours of play is really impressive to me.ScreenThe screen is decent. there is a slight visible bit of pixelation but, again, it never takes away from the immersion. Brightness is good and the colors are great as well, no gripes there. It's solidGamesThe games list is growing every day for this and i know some VR elitists will say it doesn't have enough but for an entry level VR things things has plenty to offer in terms of games. I invite you to look the titles up on your own but i've had a ton of fun so far gaming and using multiplayer in the one zombie game i own was flawless. The microphone also worked very wellSoundVery good, very good indeed. Can outside people hear the speakers? Of course. But when you have it on the sound is great. Several friends have asked where is the sound even coming from because it works so well. Its totally directional and you can tell without looking where the character speaking is in the VR world. Very impressed.ValueShop around... please do. For $400 this thing is an extremely good value. You can surf the web, play games, watch 360 Youtube vids, cast to a phone/tv, watch movies. What else can immerse you in a VR world for $400?  Nothing i've found as of today. I had decent expectations for the Quest and i was blown away by the value. I was not dissappointed in any way and i'd gladly make this purchase again. One of the best things i've bought in years! Rarely do i have zero regrets on a purchase. This is one of those zero regret purchases.Final thoughtsIf you are on the fence about this headset... pull the trigger. This will be the first big step in bringing VR into every home. From ease of use to the quality of build i could not be more happy. I didn't buy from Amazon to ensure i had it in my hands on day one, and a week later of heavy VR time i regret nothing. The Quest delivers what it promised. A stand alone VR headset that can be used almost anywhere. I love showing people who have never used VR this thing, they are blown away.  This is what the future of VR looks like. Stand alone, solid performance.I hope this review was helpful to you

My Glasses got scratched by Oculus lens rubbing against them. I have the included spacer installed. The spacer should be thicker. I have very thin glasses, yet the lenses within Goggles still we're close enough to ruin my expensive progressive glasses. A large rub mark 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch is now on center of my glasses. It ruined both lenses of my glasses. As for my glasses getting ruined I'm bummed, they were expensive.  Also the Quest now has small rub marks on each lense. I would like to have the lenses replaced.  It would be nice if the headset had a focus wheel for each lens, then one would not need to wear their glasses unless they have a strong stigmatisim.

I am kinda in love with this thing! This review is going to jump all over the place in the most annoying fanboy way possible.I have only used my Oculus Gear and the VR roller coasters that popped up in malls in the mid 90s. Oculus Quest is a massive upgrade from the Oculus Gear. There is no comparison to be honest. With Gear, you could only turn your head to look around the virtual space which led to migraines and nausea for me. 15 to 20 minutes was all I could comfortably stand in Gear. With Quest, I never wanna take it off.  I don't know what the technical term for it is, but the ability to actually MOVE through a space instead of just turning my head to look at it completely remedied my VR headaches and nausea issues.It is immersive as hell. Several times I found myself attempting to lean on a table or countertop. It's...I don't know. You kinda need to try it for yourself. I think BestBuy may have them to demo.The graphics are nothing to complain about. If you are expecting photorealistic graphics and a 4k display zapped in your eyes from these teensy screens, you'd be better avoiding all VR for awhile. The picture quality I've experienced has been clear and clean. The screen door effect from Gear is not at all present. I've read negative reviews saying it is pixely, but that is not what I am seeing. Yes, you are able to see some pixels, but this had in no way negatively impacted my experience. Not 4k by any means, but still a great picture.For watching movies, it is fantastic! The Gear changed how I fly. I am a nervous flyer and using Gear to watch movies helped me escape the plane panic I usually feel. I can't wait for my next flight with Quest.The ability to be in a giant movie theater by myself while in the comfort of my bed is decadent. The ability to Matrix dodge bullets in Super Hot is godlike. The ability to mark out your safe play area with the Guardian system is game changing. No cord jutting out of the back of your head. I mean, I'm in love.The only complaints I have so far are the battery life and the discomfort of the back strap. The battery lasts about 2.5 hours of playtime, but you can charge it while you play. I have an external battery pack that I keep it plugged to and just stick the extra battery in my back pocket. It has worked really well. I may have played 6 hours with the battery...  For the strap discomfort, I bought a counterweight for the back of the device to offset the weight of the front. That has worked surprisingly well.There are about 50 titles for it right now. Job Simulator, Super Hot, Apex Construct, Accounting+, and Journey of the Gods I highly recommend. If you like drawing or sculpting, absolutely get Tilt Brush. It is just incredible. There are tons of titles already confirmed for release soon, and Oculus said it will be backwards compatible with your Oculus Go titles by the end of the year.So that is my all over the place review as of now. Fanboying so hard. I'm totally in love.

Dear Oculus, it pains me to give this a two star rating. I am so impressed with the Quest. From the packaging, to the cell app set up, ergonomics, you have created a sexy piece of TechArt. I was in absolute agony to return it.I bought this for my son, he loves playing games on Steam and watching YouTubers play games. He wanted to play the VR games available on Steam. Unfortunately, he couldn't do that with Quest. Steams website indicated my PC isn't fast enough to handle VR, I thought Quest would be the perfect solution.From what I'm learning, it appears Quest speaks an Android language, thus able to process and use games and apps written for Android. The games my son wants to play are written for PC and not available in the Oculus game library. This was a heartbreaking moment, because you really have created a beautiful VR environment. I can imagine this game unit as the future, but currently the game choices are just too limited, and pricey.

If I could give ZERO stars, I would.Appalling customer service. They just keep pushing you around from their chat service to their email responses.I bought the 128 GB Quest, but because of Covid, was unable to fire up the system until June 13th. I immediately spent $239.99 over the next couple of days on apps and games. I also spent money on other after market accessories like head pads, beat sabers and other stuff. Maybe another $150 worth of kit. So over $1000 all told.To my immense dismay the headset had a fault from the get go. A green slash line across the left lens. And it made using the system unbearable. I tried to fix this issue - looking in forums etc, but without success. After my third time (TOTAL) using my Oculus, I decided to reach out to their customer service on June 18th. I was told to send pictures of the damaged lens. Which I did. Then I was told to mail in the headset. Which I did. They received it on June 27th. I was told that I would receive news within 2-3 days. When no news had arrived by August 9th, I reached out again. I was told I would have news soon.When I finally chased Oculus for an update on my order status on Aug 19th, saying that I was fed up with being in the dark about the status of my headset and now wanted not just a replacement but to be compensated for the inconvenience… rather conveniently / mysteriously, an abrupt order was made that very day to despatch a replacement headset to me. It was almost as though they’d forgotten all about me.I immediately saw from the email of this “order” that the headset would be a refurbished one.I wrote to them right away saying that this would not be an acceptable solution as far as I was concerned.The fact that anyone at Oculus thinks its remotely acceptable to palm off a second hand product on a customer who has just spent $648.27 on a brand new system is incredible. It’s not as if I’ve had my headset for months. It was literally out of the box new.I don’t care if the refurb headset has been painstakingly renovated and the strap and face cushion has been replaced. It’s an older product. Possibly an earlier generation version of the Quest. Either way, it’s considered used. For all I know it had a fault with it at some point. I have no idea how it’s been treated and how old it really is. I can see from the headset cover that it’s more faded than my new one was. Batteries and other components erode with use. It’s just a fact. Which is why refurbished units don’t have the same value online. That tells you everything you need to know.I paid a lot of money for a brand new Oculus. Would you accept a polished and serviced second hand car with mileage on the clock and a missing damage report history as a replacement for your brand new, never been driven car? No, you would not.While I allowed Oculus the latitude of using Covid as an excuse for the 2 month lag it took to “solve” the problem, I have received no reciprocal respect or sensitivity to my situation. They refused a refund on the system on the basis that it was more than 30 days until the problem was reported (despite the usage data supporting my case that i reported the problem as soon as i started using the system), but the even bigger kick in the nuts was when they told me they would not be refunding any of my apps or games ($239,99) despite most of them having been unused - BECAUSE IT WAS MORE THAN 2 MONTHS SINCE THEY WERE DOWNLOADED. The 2 months they had my headset. Incredible.In most instances, when you have let a customer down with the quality of your product, industry standard practice is to go above and beyond. To not just resolve the problem, but to leave the customer feeling even better about the experience of dealing with your company. I paid more than $880 for a premium quality experience and got the polar opposite of that. Instead of thinking “How can we turn this disappointing experience into a positive one?” Oculus have treated me with complete contempt.Their support service is a black box designed to exhaust customers into submission. No accountability. No option to speak to an actual human. No supervisors. Everyone parroting the same corporate speak. I’ve been trapped in an endless cycle of chat support, email, chat support, email…DO NOT BUY AN OCULUS PRODUCT. YOU WILL REGRET IT.

There's a lot to love about the Quest, and a few nagging issues.  The thing looks amazing, something from a movie prop department. The controllers are reminiscent of classic SF space ships. It charges via the included cord - really, really long USB-C to USB-C. It's just - fun. Especially seeing the looks people have when trying it out.I've been using this for a few days now, gone through a few charges, tried games and videos, watched Netflix and viewed my own 360 photos and 360 videos.Setup takes about 20 minutes.  It requires having either an Oculus account, or a FaceBook account (remember, FB owns Oculus.) Everything is done over your smart phone or tablet. Make sure your phone/tablet's WiFi is on - the files are big and can suck up your cell data fast. WiFi has to be on when installing the software, but not downloading - I made that mistake and chewed up a ton of data. I also downloaded the PC software, as the Oculus site links to is. But the Quest is not one of the supported headsets.  I can see the point - the Quest IS a stand alone gaming device.Gameplay: The tracking is flawless. It's amazing. Truly immersive. It's difficult to NOT drop a controller when dropping a weapon, or to want to try walking up to a window to look out and so on. The demo/training apps are a blast. I did not notice any lag or other issues.  The Oculus controllers are basically a traditional gamepad broken in two. Quick to adapt to and learn to use. Traditional trigger, bumper and joystick placement. However you can only play games you purchase from the Oculus store - $10 and up. Average $30.Watching video:  Again, really fun. Netflix gives you a living room setup that looks like it's in a $10 million mansion in the mountains . I keep wanting to walk around or grab the cup of cocoa and have a taste. Where it shines is 360 content on YouTube. WOW. No stuttering, smooth. 8K video is mind blowing (remember you're looking at only a small portion of the video sphere, so 4K can actually look fuzzy.)  You're only looking at a 2K window of an 8K 360 video as you look around.  I have several 360 videos I shot over the past year on YouTube and it was really fun to watch these - and see myself walking around. And seeing my bald spot first hand. THAT part was not fun. Skydiving, Scuba diving with sharks, flying through Notre Dame. The Dali museum video. All worth watching and sharing.Video quality. If you're looking at video or playing a game with really bright and dark areas, there's sometimes visible light streaking. Same when trying to read text.  The lenses are a ""fresnel"" type - one side is smooth the other has concentric circles. These can distort the text and create bright spots that look like reflections - I kept checking to make sure there was no light leaking in the mask. Finally tried it in a dimmer room before I realized the effect was inside the headset. It's especially obvious watching Netflix.PC use: Not officially supported, you can find youtube videos on it. It can be done but it's more of a work in progress and not from Oculus.  With this workaround you can play Steam VR games, but not with full support. Some buttons don't work or are swapped, etc. The PC software from Oculus does not support the Quest.Fit: Does anyone have a nose this big? Looking down, I see my feet through the gap.  I finally put a piece of felt inside to cover it. The size adjustments are quick and easy, but it is really front heavy. I noticed the weight after around 15 minutes. It also runs HOT. Ever watch a video or play a demanding game on your phone and feel the battery heat up? Same thing. One advantage to this - the inside of the mask stays warm and dry so the lenses don't fog up.  I did find that my forehead constantly bumped against the lenses when removing the mast or putting it on. It took some practice to (mostly) avoid this. Grip the head straps on the back of your head. Grip the headset. Pull the headset forward off your face (there's some springy give that's designed for this) pull the straps up, then the mask forward.Sound: Pretty darn incredible. I did have some issues on a couple of YouTube videos, but for the most part was fantastic. Since it's basically mini-speakers on either side of the headset, others can gear it as well, and you can still hear ambient sounds.  There's 1/8"" headset jacks on either side of the headset, and any earbuds will work. Many headphones will also work - my Steel Series gaming headphones are perfect. My Sony Noise cancelling ones are too big.Casting: If your device supports Chromecast, you can mirror what you see to the device.  Our smart TV has Chromecast built-in. Works amazingly well. Same with my Android tablet and phone. The TV would be fun for gaming parties.Other comments: The video passthrough is . . . unsettling. You see a high contrast black and white immersive image of your surroundings. You can walk around, grab things, etc. The controllers look totally normal though. The scale is a little off. It reminds me of walking around after drinking a big glass of Merlot. But it is also really slick and fun. Setting up the safe/play area is simple. I had to adjust the floor once - initial setup used the location of the controllers. Since they were on my desk, the desk height was set to floor height.  When setting up the play area, watch out for overhang - table tops, countertops, etc. I initially traced around the bases of the cabinets and tables.  So I ran my hands into the overhangs a few times. I picked up a micro-fiber cloth to keep the lenses clean, and ordered a big pair of googly eyes to stick on the front. There's a sensor in the face area that turns off the screens when the headset is removed, and turns them on again automatically when you wear it.Tons of fun, and you're playing while standing up.  You can watch videos sitting down. The FPS shooter demos added a new dimension (pun intended) - you can literally look over your shoulder.  For a stand-alone system, it's incredible.  I just wish they would have included VirtualLink port support, since Oculus is one of the forces behind the technology. But alas the l-o-n-g USB-C cable is just for charging.

Firstly let me just say that I’m a VR enthusiast, I have literally all VR headsets from PSVR Oculus CV1 with three sensors, HTC Vive OG, HTC Vive Pro (with wireless adaptor) purchased Oculus Rift S, and finally Occulus Quest.To sum this up, this is the easiest most convenient most travel friendly VR headset on the market!The occulus Created apps are designed specifically for the headset and the hardware and it’s quite obvious they are beautiful, the conversion apps aren’t as impressive, you can tell all the developer did was cut the graphics and put no effort into polishing it. Vader immortal in itself is worth buying the headset IMO! The library is currently limited but still a nice collection!The tracking is incredible, the performance is incredible the graphics 6/10 compared to Vive Pro 10/10 maxed out with supersampling.In the end it’s a headset I’m proud to show off and bring to friends houses, parties, or just throw on and play a quick game, it’s just so simple? As an example I probably threw it on 10 times today just sporadically? I know it’s new but all the games I’ve played before I was just eager to play without all the fuss, turning on a computer, setting up sensors, tweaking the system for optimal performance? All that’s cut out you just Put it on your head and play! The os is simplified and runs flawless I had zero lock ups, battery life is acceptable, the speakers could Use some amplification but oculus included headphone jacks so you can’t complain?Overall I highly recommend this VR headsets, specifically to anyone new to the world of VR.This is the future of VR, chipsets and mobile processors and GPu are only getting faster, eventually it will all be network driven.Game on! See you in the Oasis

Absolutely amazing. Beat Saber and Pistol Whip have become my cardio. I thought I'd end up playing more PC games using Oculus Link, even for games that are crossbuy, because I usually prefer the best graphics. But I almost exclusively play Quest titles because the freedom of cordless is just too awesome, and while the graphics on PC are certainly better, I never really notice once I get into the game. Some of the games (like Beat Saber) have almost no noticeable graphics drop. Still, the fact Oculus Link even exists makes this a no brainer. This is the single best cost for entertainment purchase I've made in a very long time, and I'd rather spend 2 hours doing cardio in VR than 20 minutes on a treadmill.

We have reached the point where VR is ready for prime time. It's not perfect, but this is a quantum leap that divides the pre-3D era from the VR era.  It's not cheap, but the cost is now comparable to other gaming platforms, within the reach of many consumers. Games are indeed a lot shorter to play through than similar titles on PS4 or PC. But the immersive experience is a totally new feeling and very obviously the way of the future.There are plenty of gripes. Number one is that the headset fogs easily and often. Many games are extremely vigorous to play and you'll be heating up and sweating a lot, which means fog on the viewing lenses.  And the battery life of the wireless headset is short, just a few hours. The controllers also eat AA battery power like crazy and need to be changed every few days.But the experience is incredible.  After playing just a few sessions, I have no interest in returning to regular video games, despite the higher detail and smoother motion.Our family has had a LOT of time to spend playing video games during the quarantine, and Quest has made it so much easier to stay at home. Because we've been underwater, flying over the country, exploring natural wonders, surviving zombie outbreaks, and boxing against Apollo Creed - all in our living room.

I currently have a Vive Pro hooked up to a pretty nice gaming rig... but I just coudln't resist a portable VR solution. I picked up the Quest at a local retailer since Amazon was sold out. I am truly impressed by the quality of this thing. Controllers are high quality and a joy to use. The headset does not seem overly heavy, and is pretty comfortable. The screens themselves are supprisingly clear with minimal screen door effect. Not having wires or any externally required hardware makes the quest a truly portable system, and room scale setup takes no more than a few seconds to setup.The graphical fidelity is pretty dependent on the games themselves. Some games that were designed to be more cartoony and blocky perform very well and look nice n' sharp. Other games that were not designed with these lower specs in mind had to really bring down those graphics, and it's not always as nice as you'd like. Not just regarding the lower quality textures and models, but even lowering the resolution so the game looks fuzzy. Games that do not require this look stunning, and are more enjoyable to play on the quest than even the vive pro, since the wireless gaming experience is just a better one. And some games will simply never make it onto the Quest. But if you're looking for a VR experience that's accessible, portable, and provides an optimal VR experience, there is really no better option than the Quest. And for a price about the same as a standard gaming console, you'll be experiencing a whole new level of gaming immersion without being tethered to an expensive gaming rig. Go get one. You'll be happy you did!

Do not buy!!!!The hardware is great so far.  The support is so bad that I can’t recommend purchasing an oculus quest.  I needed to change the password on my account, when I entered a new password I received the error, “Something went wrong. Please try again.” A meaningless error like this is a programming failure.I tried many different password iterations.  I always get the same error.  I contacted support via chat.  They were not able to help.  The tech said “we need to move you to email.”When I asked what that meant that said they could not escalate my issue until I closed the chat.  And that the “investigation team” only communicates by email. I did not receive any contact for 24 hours after this chat session.  I then reached out again. This is a what I received in response:“We are going to continue looking further into the issue you have expressed. This does not mean that we have stopped working on your issue, just that it will require more time for us to do our investigation.We appreciate your patience and understanding, and we will do our best to contact you back with more information or an update in the next 3-5 business days (from Monday-Friday).Kind Regards, ​​XxxxxxxOculus Support“3-5 days???????This is unacceptable.

I have had it now for 10 days. Previously, I did have the PS4 VR so I can compare this Occulus Quest with the PS4 VR.Pros:-It's the most versatile VR headset for a budget because not only can you play games designed for stand alone Quest games, you have the option of linking it via cable to a Game PC to play Occulus RIft games, so it's like two VR headsets in one. Keep in mind that the PS4 VR has the most games and by that I mean quality AAA games but you need a PS4. If you already have a PS4, the PS4 VR is a no brainer, but if you don't have one, then you need to purchase a PS4 which is an added expense.-It's a great value. I got mine for 399. And you get a lot for it. As previously stated, It is not just a VR headset but also has a computer inside to play it's own QUEST VR games. Meaning it doesn't need a separate Game PC like other VR headsets. Keep in mind the ""computer"" in the Quest VR is based on a mobile chipset, so it's not powerful or comparable to a Gaming PC, or even the PS4, and that means the VR games for the Quest are much more simple graphically but it still great value for what you're spending and getting. I personally have not tried any Quest VR games because I got the Quest to link it to my Game PC which has the hardware to play real and more complex VR games for the PC.Cons:-This is a big one. It's uncomfortable. The PS4 VR was so comfortable though it's cumbersome with the cables connecting it to the PS4. Every VR headset requires some cables to a PC or a game console like the PS4. The Occulus Quest, because it has it's own computer built in doesn't need cables unless you use the Occulus Link cable to attach it to a PC. But the problem with the Quest is, after about 1 or 2 hours, I can feel my cheeks hurting. The reason is the design is front heavy, putting all the weight upon your cheeks and face, instead of the Halo design of other more expensive VR headsets. You get what you pay for. So comfort is a big negative for me. But it is 399.-Software set up and ease of use. I mainly use the Quest to link it to my Game PC and this requires a Link cable, and the Occulus software which turns the Occulus Quest functionally into an Occulus Rift S headset. The software has problems and is buggy. The installation has some errors and I have to manually start the Occulus server software every time I want to link it to my PC. I only solved this bug because I googled it and not many will be able solve this bug. It's not a big hassle but the software is not polished. This is why it's called BETA software meaning it's not finished. If you only play Occulus Quest games, then you don't have to deal with this. But I mainly got the Quest to link it to my PC. So it's kind of a hassle but I deal with it. The bigger problem is the poor comfort and ergonomics.Who is this VR Quest for?I think the Occulus Quest is for those who want an introductory easy to use stand alone VR headset for a low price of 399 for the 64 GB model.  I haven't played any Quest VR games but there is an Occulus store that has a decent selection of simple VR games. There are also free apps that enable you to watch netflix or amazon prime movies with it.It is also for those who want a cheap vr headset to play PC VR games via the Occulus Link. The Occulus Rift S is unavailable or sold out, and other options like the HTC Cosmos are more expensive. The downside of the Occulus Quest is it is uncomfortable, and the Occulus software to link the Quest to the PC is beta and buggy.But I use the Occulus Quest almost every day for a few hours. It works well but my cheeks ache but I put up with it because I enjoy VR gaming.Because of the reasonable price, I recommend the Occulus Quest for it's versatility and value but it is uncomfortable and painful to use because of it's front heavy design.

This is a great headset. Running tethered to a computer or untethered, it has great levels of immersion. I presume most will be using it untethered as that's where it really shines: it has ""eh"" graphics but a feeling unlike any other VR as you don't have to worry about a cable. I recommend playing Superhot VR, as it's my favorite untethered game.However, I use this headset mostly with Oculus Link to my PC playing Half-Life: Alyx. It's great for that, and the OLED display means that dark black areas actually feel dark, as opposed to the Rift S and its LED backlit display, which doesn't do dark areas as well. However, it is my belief that Oculus Link adds some lag as opposed to a real PCVR headset, which makes me skew towards something else if you're going to exclusively be playing VR on a PC. I would get the original Rift, as I would hate playing on a non-OLED display, or the Vive (or obviously the Index, if you have that amount of money to throw around.) However, I can't really recommend this headset for exclusively tethered play, as the refresh rate is quite low compared to everything else and it has some lag. But it's a great thing to buy and show off to your friends who have never tried VR before, and it absolutely delivers a playable experience in Half-Life: Alyx. It's by no means a bad headset for tethered VR at all, I just would have gotten something else (if anything else would have been in stock - I bought it in late April, when the COVID-19 pandemic was in full force and basically every electronics item was sold out, including every VR headset known to man. I had to camp a competitor's website and buy it for in-store pickup.) Also, bear in mind if you want to use tethered VR, you should have a pretty beefy PC - I had to upgrade to a GTX 1080 after my old RX 480 was giving me stutters in Half-Life at low settings (paired with a 5820K @ 4.3GHz.)Also, I recently had an issue where it seems the left speaker is giving out on the headset, so fair warning. Luckily, support seems like they'll be taking decent care of me.All in all, it's a perfectly fine headset at a perfectly good price point that does both tethered and un-tethered VR pretty well. It's definitely the thing to buy if you want untethered VR, but also want to be able to plug in and play some Half-Life or something, but if you're looking for the most immersive experience and you have money to throw around, I'd definitely get the Index.

My boyfriend just surprised me with a quest the other day and I had never heard of it, but setup was easy and I was amazed!Unfortunately, the device is heavy and causes some head and face pain after wearing it for an extended period of time. Today is the third day I’ve owned it and after a short morning play session, I’m also experiencing some soreness in my neck. I’m hoping adding another strap and counter weight will help and that an adjustment period will ease the discomfort. Other than that, I love itUPDATE:I read some tips from other users on another website that recommended wearing the strap as close to the base of your skull as possible, almost touching your neck. After having adjusted the strap as recommended, it was noticeably more comfortable to wear the headset. Before, I was wearing the strap quite a bit higher on my head, so no wonder it was so uncomfortable. At the same time, I think a counter weight would still make it better

I remember my fascination with VR going way back to the time of the Sega Master System when it had the 3D glasses. It was clunky but cool at the same time. Well it wasn't really VR but to have a more interactive ""realistic"" experience where you are part of the game was how I pictured the future.Then came the 90s when Sega announced that they were coming out with a VR platform and I was just super excited and waited month after month reading EGM, GamePro, and Sega Visions magazines to see if there was any news or development on the VR. Unfortunately, it faded into vaporware. Let's ignore the Virtual Boy and the Stuntmaster because they were both garbage...Fast forward a decade (or two) later when VR went mainstream with the Vive, Rift, and PSVR. I was on and off in the PC Master Race so I grabbed the PSVR on launch day and was just amazed out how well executed and easy to setup it was. Plus the PSVR was also more affordable than the Vive and Rift a few years ago. The games were engaging, the experience just draws you in and I was able to do it all CONNECTED to my PS4. I will admit I was scared playing Resident Evil and playing one of my favorite racing games, Wipe Out is a whole different experience in VR. Problem was that:I had limited space in my game roomIt had to be tethered to the PS4 which takes the realism away in terms of movementPlaystation Move controllers, although effective were a bit awkward to useNow here we are with the introduction of the Oculus Quest which is a standalone VR unit with all the hardware build in. No console, no phone, no PC or any device that it had to be tethered to. A device where I can dive into VR anywhere! It actually sounded to good to be true. Let me tell you this... after using this for a month, I can confidently say that the future is here.I picked up the 128GB version at a local Best Buy on launch day. I'm sure it was a little overkill and I would have been fine with the 64GB but I didn't want to think about storage running out. Anyway, I took it out of the box, downloaded the app and some games while it was charging, did the initial setup and had some fun playing around with the tutorial.Speakers are kinda weak but not THAT bad. The headset is very responsive but it does get uncomfortable after using it for long periods of time. However, it was no more uncomfortable as the PSVR and the fact that I can play this without yanking my PS4 or being connected to another device is just amazing. Sure it doesn't have the latest hardware being powered by a Snapdragon 835 (yeah the same CPU as the Samsung Galaxy S8) but it is just so well executed.Finally loaded up Vader Immortal and then got a low battery warning because over an hour had gone by without me realizing it.I also purchased and bought Beat Saber. To this day, I use it as part of my morning work outs to get the blood running when I start my day. I've been hooked on the game and it brought me back to the old Dance Dance Revolution days except this is so much better. I just hope that continue to come out with more songs.Other game that I really enjoy playing is Robo Recall. It reminds of of those arcade shooters like Virtua Cop except you are actually in the game and you grab robots, rip them limb from limb and throw them around. This is definitely a must buy.A non-game app that I tried was Virtual Desktop. Virtual Desktop wghich is sort of like LogMeIn or other remote desktop apps, but in VR. I even fired out some YouTube videos through Chrome on my desktop but it was a little laggy. You are better off using the browser on the Oculus. Opened up Microsoft Outlook and was able to read through my emails. There a handful of instances where you can play some Steam VR games on a desktop using this, but I personally haven't tried it. I'm sure this application will be a lot better as the continue to develop this.I wanted to make sure I just wasn't going through a honeymoon phase because I remember being wowed and amazed right when I got the PSVR and now it's just collecting dust, and that's just mainly because it was sort of a hassle getting it setup.It's been a month and I have been using this every day. Like I mentioned, it doesn't have the best graphics due to hardware limitations but the games are well ported where it doesn't take away from the experience. Games do run smoothly and it's just so easy to just pick up and start playing.I can go on and on in this review but I can only describe the VR experience in so many words. You have to try it for yourself to fully understand how great the Oculus Quest is. The Quest is not perfect but it has taken me to a future that I dreamed of as a child.  What a wonderful time to be alive.

I've used several VR headsets in the past but never owned one myself as I did not have space near my gaming PC to play; then along came the Quest and now I can play in my living room with no strings(or wires) attached. The experience is darn near that of a PC with just lower quality graphics, this loss of visual quality is easily made up by the portability and ease of access to this device. Right out of the box you are able to get up and running within minutes with no running of cabling or fiddling with the configuration on a PC. In addition, the ability to take this to a friend's house to show off the wonder of VR is something which cannot be matched by any VR solution to date.My only real complaint is the cost of games is a bit steep considering you are paying for what essentially is a downgraded port of already existing games; in addition, a number of these games (including the best seller on the system Beat Saber) are not cross buy. As such if you already own an Oculus product this is something you will want to factor into your decision. If you are a first time VR purchaser such as myself you will likely not have an issue with this.Overall I would recommend this headset to anybody interested in getting started with VR as well as those with some experience who want a way to move out of their PC room while playing or as a way to show off VR to those who have yet to try it.

Due to its weak, old chipset, same as Samsung Galaxy S8, the graphic suffers terribly and plenty of lag. The PS2 graphic gaming is perfect for adults that have not fully grown out of cartoon phase. If you have a normal mental development and are a fully grown adult, get a PCVR instead from Amazon, you get to play Racing, Flying, and FPS simulation. But if you love cartoons and lags, this is the VR headset to get.

This is my second VR headset and intended upgrade to the PSVR which I've had for a few years. Loved the PSVR but wanted to try roomscale and higher resolution without getting too carried away in price. I also wanted something capable of playing AAA titles like Half-Life Alyx and Fallout 4 VR. I have a compatible cable and PC but have not had time to try those games yet. I may update this review later to discuss my thoughts on how this handles high-end games. For now, let's jump into my impressions after a few days of use. This review will mostly be valuable to people with PSVR considering venturing into PC VR gaming.SET-UP: There really isn't any hardware set-up required beyond charging the headset (about 2 hours) and putting batteries in the controllers. Functionality set-up is done via smart phone. It seemed like this was going to be an easy task until I got to the part of connecting it to wi-fi which is a requirement before you can use the headset. I spent about 2 hours fighting to get it to connect. I was entering what was absolutely the correct password for my wi-fi and it kept saying I had the incorrect password. It was getting infuriating to the point where I was about to just box it up and return it. I emailed Oculus's support and they came back about 15 hours later saying to try re-configuring my router from WEP to WPA2. I haven't messed with my router since I set it up about 7 years ago so had to go through another 2 hours of research, downloading the software and getting it switched over. Of course that also meant setting a new password which required me to update the dozen devices I have in the house to the new PW. PIA! But anyway, after 2 days of swear words and tech fighting, it worked and I got connected! Hooray! Oh, wait. Not so fast. Now it's updating the firmware and would just stop at about 98% after hours of updating. So now it's back to the internet. That's where I found that set-up from my smartphone wasn't complete because I didn't watch some safety video. Aaarrhgg!!!! Finished the video and then my phone sent the signal to my device that I was finally allowed to use it and it finished the update. So...set-up. Terrible if you go into it blind. Piece of cake if you read this review first. You're welcome.OPERATION: Once you finally get this thing on, the immediate experience is stunning. Setting up room scale will blow your mind. You basically paint your boundaries on the floor and it builds a wall exactly where you marked it. Then you simply do not run into anything because it gives you advanced warning. Spectacular technology! The controllers are comfortable and simple to use, much more intuitive and natural feeling than move controllers. The navigation/orientation room is fun to look at and navigate. Pretty neat display panel for the store. You can walk around the room in your defined space and it feels very natural like you're actually there. Just make sure your cats aren't in the room and you don't step on them like I did. Sorry, Skylar.GRAPHICS/IMMERSION: Compared to the PSVR, the graphics are definitely noticeably better. Much brighter, crisper and less screen door. The OLED & higher resolution makes a big difference. That said, don't go into it thinking it's going to look like a 4K movie because it's still VR. The tech just isn't there yet to make it look like you're on Pandora from Avatar. It looks pretty good but temper your expectations realistically. VR is still mostly about immersion and this headset does an incredible job of it. The first game I purchased and tried was Vader Immortal and it did not disappoint. On PSVR, the most similar experience would be Batman Arkum VR. Only with Vader, you can actually move, not just teleport. That and it's visually much cleaner and lifelike.COMFORT: Here's where the star comes off. I didn't knock a star off for the set-up because the review is for a functional headset. I try not to let set-up experiences impede review of the actual product. However, the comfort of this headset is not the best. I was actually shocked at the laziness of the design. It's just side Velcro straps and one poorly placed strap on the top. This causes all of the weight to shift to your face. And since this is a heavier headset since it's basically got it's own onboard computer and power supply, it gets very cumbersome after about 30 minutes of use. It puts quite a bit of pressure on your cheeks, nose and around the eyes. However, there simple aftermarket bands available on Amazon that basically adds a horizontal strap across the head that apparently completely solves the problem. Again, it's just amazing to me that Oculus skimped out on this very simple and very cheap extra step that would make their device perfectly fine for extended use.I will update this review once I have experience using it tethered to a gaming PC. From what I've read from other users, it's on par if not better than the Oculus S in those regards. But overall, my conclusion is for the price, the bump in graphic quality and the deep immersion of the roomscale, the Quest is definitely worth buying and is probably the best available VR experience on the market from a value & investment perspective. The comfort issues are solved with a $15 strap and the initial set-up woes I encountered likely don't happen for most people. And if they do, you now have my experience to get you through it.

I just got my Quest last week and have been having a blast with it. I'm fairly new to VR and don't have a PC so this was pretty much my only option other than PSVR but I had decided on the Quest due to supposed better tracking and no wires was just too hard to pass up.Pros:*The inside-out tracking is very impressive, rarely does it lose track of where I am within my guardian zone or where my controllers are*A lot of games available right away*The immersion into these worlds is hard to describe to people without them actually trying it out but you get lost in them fairly quickly.*Price is good for a VR headset that can do what this can doCons:*While it's cheap for a VR headset, it's certainly not easily affordable at $400 minimum*Games generally range from $15 up to $40, with a few free ones and some demos (why this is a con below)*A lot of these games are fun but feel more like technical demos that after a few hours of play may lose their appeal*The recommendation is for at least 6.5' x 6.5' of room. It was surprisingly hard to find that much space in our house. You can do it with less but there are some games that require a bit more movement but this hasn't been too much of an issue*My overall worry is that after a while the ""wow"" factor will disappear and if the games don't actually have a story or lasting appeal the Quest (or perhaps VR in general) could go the way of the Wii or the Kinect; a novel, cool idea that was nothing more than a gimmick or fad.

Wow.  When VR first hit the scene it was a) too expensive, b) required a hefty investment into a upper mid-range to high end PC and c) image quality was low (due to resolution / performance trade offs).  The Occulus Quest makes all the proper improvements and design trade-off's to bring VR to the masses.  It offers a full 6 degrees of freedom (tilt, yaw,  rotate and 3 degrees of translation freedom) normally reserved to externally tracked head sets.  The device is truly stand alone yet offers the ability to link to a PC for PC level apps and games.  Wireless (without a PC) to simplify usage.  The inside-out tracking means no external light boxes to setup, no extra hardware.  Literally, slap it on your head, grab the controllers, define a play area and done... you are in VR.If there is any complaint of this headset would be that because it contains it's own processor, memory, and battery all that comes with some weight and it is front heavy and can become a little uncomfortable after long game sessions.  Minor annoyance when you consider what you get.

The quest has a long list of games that will run on it without being plugged into anything.  You just download it from the store using the Quest or your phone with Oculus app and run.However... with a long enough USB cable and the right hardware you can run Oculus Rift S games as well off of your PC.  Just connect your Quest to your PC and run the Oculus link software and you can run games using your PC's power (make sure you have a good machine with a good graphics care).But wait... there's more ;-)  If you have Steam you can run SteamVR from the Oculus store via Oculus Link (just like a Rift) and then you can run Steam VR games like  Half Life Alyx, Skyrim VR, or Fallout 4 VR.The ONLY caveat is that you need a USB C connector on your PC AND that still might not work.  Some motherboards will support this and others do not.  I have a nice machine (I9, 32GB, RTX2080) and it would not work through the front USBC port.  It DID work great through the RTX2080's USB C port though and that is good enough for me).The link is still beta and while it works once up and running there is a little bit of trial and error to get the right workflow.  Start up the Quest unplugged... then start the Oculus app.  THEN connect through the USB... and then allow the link software to run.First time you run run the Steam VR from your PC.  After that you should be able to run it from the Quest itself but only after you set up the link.Not horrible but it can be a little fickle sometimes but once it runs there is normally never any problems.  It's quite good.

This is an initial review and may be updated if Ocuclus lives up to the warranty.  The device worked great for the first two weeks I had it.  Easy to set up, easy to use, and I enjoyed the games. (I got great exercise from a couple of games.) Only thing I really had an issue with: virtually none of the apps I use on the Go are available on the Quest.  So if I wanted to attend a virtual concert or sport event on Oculus Events or NextVR I have to pull out the Go.  After two weeks the device died. No longer charges at all and there really is no guidance on their support page on what to do in this situation.  I submitted a trouble ticket to Oculus asking for assistance so this will be a test of their warranty and support.  If it gets fixed/replaced I'll update my review.

I'm a VERY technical person, but I had no interest in dedicating a computer and a zillion wires to VR; it seemed like the technology wasn't ready for prime time.  Until now.The Quest is essentially an all-in-one gaming console based entirely in VR.  It works beautifully--and simply--and the launch games are very good.Setup is simple, battery life is as predicted, and the gameplay is quick and responsive.The only drawback really is that you need a large-is space to play.  You CAN play in a small space (and we do) but the thing really comes alive when you can stretch your legs!  (Some folks would say that it's slow to charge--about a minute spent charging for each minute of play--but honestly I think you'll find that you need the break.)Not cheap, but not outlandishly priced. Feels like you are buying a bit of the future at a pretty decent price.

*Update*Ok. I found some games I like.  They aren't the shoot um up ones.. I'm playing the Beat Saber and Synth Riders games.  Now those are worth the money, for me.  Still disappointed in the resolution of the other games compared to the tethered games but I'll keep this for the workout I'm getting with these two games.  Hopefully more will come in the near future!Original:The Go was neat for the first 24 hrs.. then its very limited.  So took it back and bought the Quest when it finally came in stock.. that is better but the games SUCK!  They are VERY limited.. the graphics are terrible.. there are only a few games out there in Jan 2020 and even tho they get 4.9 stars they are terrible 3rd person games where you're not even IN the game.. one in particular is MOSS where you WATCH a mouse go around  and do things...  did you read that right..  you WATCH the Mouse do things!  I didn't spend about $500 to watch a mouse do things!  When I went to the Rift site I was amazed!  Now they have games!!  Driving games are crazy on the rift.  Its like you would find on the XBOX or PS4.. they don't have anything like that for the Quest!  I am very disappointed.  I'm trying to figure out if I can get my MACBOOK to work with the new Link but its not looking like it.  I'm bummed that this is so limited.  I haven't actually found a game that I am willing to keep on this thing.  Now to get true gaming do I need to buy a gaming PC and a Rift so I can really get true VR?  Its definitely not this thing.  Before you buy try going to the Oculus app and looking at the choices of games.

UPDATE:  Oculus support finally resolved my issue after making me jump through multiple hoops. Still deducting one star due to making it so hard on customers to get decent support.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Ordered my Quest directly from Oculus. Rating here because more people will likely see it.One star purely because of their VERY poor customer support. Had an issue day 1 (app related), submitted a support request online, they responded asking for more information. I responded to their request with the information they needed. Six days later I still haven't heard back so I log in and check the ticket. It has been closed and marked ""resolved."" I go back to the headset to see if it was indeed resolved, and it was not. I then initiated an online chat and the lack of support I received there was mind boggling. Basically they just kept telling me I was out of luck (on something that should have been a very easy fix). They finally offered to escalate it to email support, which I said I had already tried and had the request closed out for no reason, with no response. The support person just kept talking in circles and would not (or could not) answer my direct questions.I have a Rift and a Quest, hardware is okay, but just pray you never have to contact support. I will definitely not be recommending Oculus to anyone, based solely on the lack of support when needed.

The VR gets 5 stars it's an amazing piece of technology.  However i bought these for my two daughters and for them to play with each other they each have to have a Facebook account. As parents we decided that social media is not appropriate nor safe for our kids at this time so for Oculous to promote the selling towards 13 and up. And not let people know that you have to have facebook in order to play with people in the same house or just your school friends is Wrong. 13year olds should not have to have a social account to play with each other. Especially since predators use social media to find their victims. By you forcing parents to get their kids an account. Just so they can play I feel like you should also be responsible and held accountable for the actions of the predators that are out there using Facebook to hunt for their innocent under age victims. If you are a parent who agrees that your kids should not have to be on social media to play. Please write to Oculus and Facebook.

Do you want to walk around inside a virtual world and use your hands? If so, then this is the cheapest and easiest way to achieve that. For some people $400 will be too much for the current level of VR content compatible with Quest. Some people should wait a couple more years for a lower price point with a more mature ecosystem. For even more adamant early adopters, a full-fledged PC VR system ($1600) is a better investment to see all that VR developers have made (e.g. Oculus Rift, Valve Index, HTC Vive, etc.). That's not me, but some of my friends want to be at that level of commitment.How does Quest work? Like much of the 2019 VR generation, the headset employs inside-out tracking; it houses four built-in cameras which track your controllers' and your headset's positions relative to the stuff/walls of your room.What do I think after using Quest for a few weeks? I think it's really amazing. I show it to people and they giggle like little kids when they see the magic of it. My wife and kid love playing Beat Saber. I like seeing all kinds of VR experiences.How long could you stay in there? I would say that spending 30-60 minutes at a time is a full session. After that my head starts to feel a little sore. Also the battery only lasts 2.5 hrs and requires a couple hours to charge. The controllers need batteries to be replaced/recharged every dozen hours of use or so.How realistic is it? Not very realistic--it is comparable to Wii graphics and locomotion is still a problem yet to have a marketable solution.How good is the content / game library? The software ecosystem is still maturing, so don't expect to spend hours reinventing some Oasis-type second-life-esque world. The experiences/games cost around $20, which isn't too bad if you have disposable income and only require a few games at a time. So far there haven't been any sales in the official Oculus market. There is also a sideloading software source that is great for customizing beat saber (needs you to plug into a desktop computer).

I had never so much as tried a VR headset, and I bought my Quest within days of trying out my boyfriend's. (I won't lie; it was ""BeatSaber"" that hooked me!)It's easy to use; setting it up with my Wifi using the Oculus app was a snap, and so was downloading games. The controls are very intuitive and comfortable, as well.The sound quality is very good without headphones (and I don't like using headphones when I'm wearing it, as I already can't see what's going on around me ... I at least want to be able to hear!). Video quality is good but not razor-sharp. I expect there will be a lot of progress on this front in the next version.The game selection currently is decent and seems to be expanding rapidly. ""BeatSaber"" is a favorite of mine and also a great workout, but my kids particularly like ""Job Simulator"" and ""Sports Scramble."" ""SuperHot"" is really fun but you need more space than I currently have in my living room to play it (I'm afraid I'm going to punch my TV by accident ...)

I'll make this short and sweet - BAM! Like a tiny disposable paper cup filled with fresh honey. I was riding the Oculus wave since the very beginning, you best bet your top and bottom dollars that I threw some money into the Kickstarter to nab myself a Devkit 1 (or DK1, as the cool peeps prefer to call it, of which I am one). Then I received the CV1 and - BOOOOM - mind blown! I was in the game, I was out of the game.  But man, that dang wire was bringing me down, tethered to my desktop. I felt imprisoned - I felt that every turn I made had to be greeted with a counter-turn to undo the twisting of the cable, and I'd still end up with a squiggly spaghetti noodle of a wire. It made me anti-wholesome. It made me sad. I had excessive trouble sleeping at night, lying wide-eyed awake in the darkness, gripped with fear of the thought that I had unknowingly forgotten to make one or two counter-turns earlier in the day and welp, that'd be it. I'd be stuck with an oinky oinky pig tail cable for the rest of my times.But the thought of the Quest was the fuel for my aching soul. I erected a shrine in the depths of my grandmother's closet, a large poster of the Quest I printed at Kinko's neatly taped to the wall, sitting over a line of fresh pumpkin spice candles arranged in a semicircle. And the day arrived when IT arrived. Freedom. Absolute. Freedom. Liberation. No cable. I could spin; I could spin to my heart's content! I could jump, I could leap, I could roll up my pant legs and dance a dance across the roof! Nary a neighbor could stop me either, not old-lady Mary with her crinkly, somber expression and foul-mouthed disdain towards ""this ***** doomed resurgence of VR"", not even mr. postman Jackson, who had a regrettable outing with a Virtual Boy in a darker period of his life, one of which still sends shivers down his spine (and his cockatiel's). For gumbo's sake, even little Timmy, skipping along the curb with that goofy grin, clutching so tightly to his LABO VR that his hands turn a pale, cold white, careful not to loosen his grip for fear of losing his cardboard-laden Switch to the hard, cold pavement below. No one could sever this surging elation, this sudden virtual delight; I was a king. Wait no, I was an emperor. No. Yeah, I was just a king.Now please let me tell you some other pertinent details. The Quest plugs wraps its smooth, silky head straps around my fuzzy head for, say, 2 hours at a time, at which the depletion of the battery requires a recharge, and I become sad. But please don't worry about me, or yourself for that matter, for Oculus graciously included a super long charging cable so you can still charge and play. It's a USB-C. I think the C stands for ""Cool"". The screen is so sharp that it'd do better on the SATs than I did. I ask, ""Dear Quest, how is your screen door effect?"" and it replies in a deep, boisterous laugh, ""SDE? What, do tell, is that?"". Quest doesn't want to admit it, that he's still susceptible to SDE , but when it's this minimal, I honestly cannot blame him for not noticing. You will need many, many kilobytes if you wish to consume lots of photography or moving pictures or big games, but 64,000,000 kilobytes will suffice for most. I demanded 128,000,000 kilobytes so I can run my Unities and my Unreals and download salt-crusted fish recipes and lots and lots of cat photographs to share with dour passengers on the public transport. Oh, the Quest doesn't work well in the dark, but I don't either - I prefer to be asleep in the dark, so I think that's why. You'll need ""reading"" lighting for the Quest to perform optimally, concerning tracking, so you may want to consider purchasing a lamp (please don't forget a lightbulb) or a large flashlight or another form of illumination for the room you anticipate you'll be wearing your Quest in. About light - you can play outside in the sun, but don't expose the lens to the sun, it was built in an a closed-off factory and can't handle the joy of bright sunshine and fresh air.The other night I was battling Darth Vader in my bedroom. And then I was slashing away at colorful floating cubes with lightsabers while euphorically slithering my body to some delectable rhythms. And then I was blasting aliens in outer space while training to become a Space Pirate. All in my bedroom. And then the next day my Quest finally arrived.I will leave you with a thought, and you may take this in any way you wish. I dance in front of my friends who still bow down to the tether. Stricken with a deep guilt and afraid they're unaware of the sublime life I live, I tirelessly try to convert them, to lead them to the warm lights and the greener pastures, a life where they too can dance freely without the unjust treatment of the tether. ""But I'd prefer to face my TV while holding colorful spheres,"" they proclaim! ""But I quite enjoy the feeling of having my feet caught between cables, the smooth texture of the wire as it slithers up my dry shins"",""I cannot leave the tether, for it grounds me, and without it, then how will I know who I am in this life, or the next?"" They so easily make a travesty of my intentions, of my helping hand, but ""Chill"", I tell myself, ""it's just a matter of time, until they too find their way in the Oculus. In the Quest."" And I hope you do too. Diss the tether!

I own an Oculus Rift (PCVR), an Oculus Go, a GearVR, multiple Google Cardboard variants, and now a Quest.The Quest is hands down my favorite VR device. The freedom of wireless VR is not to be understated. My Rift currently has an overhead cable management system, but the sensation of no longer being tethered is incredible. Moving freely in games like Robo Recall and Space Pirate Trainer has unlocked new levels of play that I simply  didn't have before.The improved visuals are incredible, using Virtual Desktop I am able to comfortably read text and even write code for extended periods while wearing the headset.So far the experience has been nothing short of amazing.

I bought this from bestbuy because they had it for $40 cheaper.  Anyway, this is the vr headset to buy period. The only reservations I have about the headset is games.  So I have owned rift, Lenova vr, PlayStation vr and Oculus’s quest.  The quest is so simple and it works. Graphically you get about 85 percent of the graphics fidelity of the rift but with so much less hassle.  I just finished Vader imorttal an it looks great. I started up moss an that games looks great as well. My fears of gameplay have been eliminated.  The quest if games are made for the system will be the lead platform in my opinion.

The Oculus quest is all I ever wanted in a VR headset. Coming from things like the Oculus GO and gear VR the quest seems light years ahead of those. The room scale tracking the lack of any wires is all amazing, I found my self getting sucked into VR in a way I never have before. That being said.The quest isn't for everyone. If you are expecting a PS4 Xbox one amazing 4k experience you may want to reduce your expectations a bit. VR is young and will be for a long time. The quest is a big leap forward sure but it is a long way from where it needs to be. The quest runs a mobile chip, which means graphics are far from being any where near what this generation of game systems offer, that being said they are impressive for what it's working on and I'm not a big graphics guy, so it doesn't matter to me, but it may to you. I would compare them to somewhere between PS2 and Xbox 360.Although the resolution sounds high when you blow it up to VR scale it's actually still low. The screen door effect is greatly reduced compared to something like gear VR but it's still there. Also the screens refresh rate is only 72 Hearts, my eyes have never been treated to a more premium VR experience but I'm told that to some this  ruins the experience. Also games are very expensive for what they are, most in the $30.00 range. And while I did own a lot of Gear/Go games most are not available to me to redownload in many cases I would have to buy the updated quest versions all of which are more expensive the the Go version. So is life!All and all the quest is amazing, but VR is young, the product isn't perfect yet, no VR head set is. Just keep in mind where VR is at the moment before you buy this.

Our first oculus quest was such a hit at our house, that we ended up purchasing a second.  The first headset has worked almost flawlessly, with only occasional crashes and pixels. The second, however, seems to have a faulty sensor.  You can turn it on, but you see only a black screen, as if it thinks you've removed the headset.  This was worked around for several weeks by putting a piece of post-it note over the sensor.  Now, it has started doing this again and no amount of turning off and on, fiddling with sensor covering and light levels, or factory resetting has gotten us around the problem.  Unfortunately, our return period expired just before this became the most disappointing gaming equipment in our home.  Ours was purchased through BestBuy, but I wanted people to know that these are pretty commonly faulty.  The forums are full of people with the same problem we have with no chime in from Oculus with a resolution.

I started out on Google Cardboard and worked my way up to Google Daydream, then the Oculus Go, and now the Quest. Here are my brief impressions of the Oculus Quest:- It's slightly heavier than the Go, but not too bad. I'm able to play for a full 2 hours and not feel any fatigue or pain. Adjusting the straps and positioning it on your head is KEY. Realistically, VR gaming sessions should be short'ish anyway (1 hr at a time, tops), to give your eyes a break and to rest (some of these games are a workout!).- Graphics and framerate are better than I expected. The Snapdragon 835 processor (same as Pixel 2) is overclocked, so it's more than just a ""crappy"" CPU as other reviewers put it.- The Guardian boundary system is cool, but currently a bit overly sensitive. If you're moving your hands quickly, the grid shows up too easily. Oculus is working on a fix for this, though.- Fully portable and no wires: this is the top selling point of this platform, and it's amazing. Yes, you're sacrificing some graphics quality compared to the Rift or any PC-based VR, but for many people, it's worth not having to worry about getting tangled up in a cord, or setting up sensors and making sure you're always in view of them.- Great for arcade-type games, interactive experiences, social apps, and more. But if you're looking for epic 40+ hour story-driven games, you're better off sticking to consoles.Overall, I think this thing is amazing and it's lived up to the hype!

Former PSVR owner here. Sold it to switch over the the Quest. So far, I can’t believe what this headset can do. Simply put, this is a device that can satisfy BOTH the newcomer and seasoned veteran. The launch lineup is pretty much entirely made up of ported titles but savvy vets don’t fret. As the old song goes “you ain’t seen nothing yet”. Finally, VR will hit the mainstream in a big way. This is the hardware that will take it there. The graphics are stellar, better than PSVR in my opinion. The tracking is nearly perfect. The controls are quickly learned and seeing a low res view of your surroundings when outside the play area through the headset is a feature not available until now. The guardian system is a total game changer. This allows you to play wherever you want and the fact that some games support kicking back in a recliner or even playing in bed is incredible. VR used to be complicated and cumbersome. The Quest has redefined VR as we know it making it as simple as sit in your favorite chair, put on the headset, and play. Casting support is great for chromecast and if you have an Apple ecosystem, the Oculus app even supports screen mirroring to Apple TV. I am so excited to see where Oculus devs take this device to. It’s looking like the perfect platform to catapult VR where it always wanted to be. Get one, you won’t be disappointed. Believe the hype, this is VR for the masses.

I've used the rift and windows mixed reality. The rift s and the mixed reality both use the same sort of idea (the S is pretty much the exact same) But oculus just does it better than my experience on lenovo and samsung.Games like robo-recall really don't look as good, but for the gains you get, it is really worth it. A lot of them like Superhot I couldn't tell a single difference. The biggest downside game-=wise, is that I can't use any of my steam games.Other things you lose are the ability to customize your home area (which supposedly is coming soon) and things like the ability to pop in another screen inside your VR game and for instance like play a movie like you can on the rift. Those are things I miss but are just small niceties.I really recommend you give it a try. This is really that first time sometone could get a full VR experience without much hassle or owning a powerful computer.

**May 30th updated**After owning my Quest for over a week I decided to return it. While the VR portion of it is spot on and super cool. For me the app ecosystem and locked down android interface just wasn't cutting it. It lost it's novelty for me fast and I can see that in 3 months I'll use the Quest much less. Making it a 500 dollar closet toy ill bring out to show friends occasionally. Most of the games that have been released for it have been out for years and are being sold for a significant markup which turns me off. I did side load it with software called side quest. However you might as well just use your phone since most phone apps do not function well in VR. Overall I still think this is a fantastic device and if you want to check it out go for it. My biggest gripes are the battery covers on the controller slide off when doing fast movements, audio can cut in and out and get garbled for whatever reason (pretty sure it's software related), wireless capabilities are kind of hit and miss. (blue tooth audio is spotty, can only cast to your phone or chrome cast, sending videos you record are a pain, and there are more TV viewing apps than I know what to do with. The VR portion of the quest is amazing! It was everything else that turned me off.This was my first VR headset and i'm blown away. After doing a lot of research on available VR headsets out there I decided the Quest was the most likely fit for me due to the wireless capabilities. I bought a Oculus Quest 128gb on launch day at Best Buy. After the initial setup of the device which is fairly simple. Download the app on your phone and pair it to the Quest. You run the ""First Steps"" app and it gave me goosebumps. The immersion and feeling you get when you play this thing is spectacular. Picking up and throwing objects with your hands, pulling levers, moving, dancing, slashes and more are all realistic motions the Quest can easily track.  The guardian boundary system is fluid and responsive all though maybe a tad too sensitive depending on the size of your play space. The camera mode when outside of the guardian system is low res and black and white. Not ideal for walking around the house but good enough for adjusting your area or grabbing your drink or something. The games that i've played so far are fantastic but wish there was more apps that could be used. There is a Netflix, Youtube, and a few other video streaming apps available. Hopefully this will change over time along with more multiplayer online or co-op games. My biggest complaints about the system is the battery covers on the controllers tend to slide off which can be fixed by a rubber band or something. The battery on the headset dies quickly (about 2-3 hours like everyone else says)  but this isn't a huge deal for me because it's usually time for a break by then anyway. It does come with a plethora of demos for you to try which is awesome since most of us have no idea what kind of VR games we are in to. Vader Immortal is like being in a real life Star Wars movie. Space Pirates Trainer is super fun VR version of space invaders and Racket Fury is also a blast that has multiplayer (ping pong). The simulated surround audio is decent for what it is and has a built in mic for party chat that will work for most people, however there is a audio jack output for those that want to use something better. The 64 gb version should be plenty for most people as the games i've downloaded are usually about 2.5Gb or less. I opted for the 128 just for the extra storage down the road just in case games start getting bigger or something. I would say the controller tracking is spot on about 96% of the time. I usually run into issues during ping pong when the headset can't pick up where the controllers are at because i'm not facing the right way or moving too fast. The OS the Oculus uses looks to be a modified version of the android OS but heavily closed down and with a totally different app store. It does have live streaming options to your Facebook account but this doesn't really seem to be totally necessary unless you do that sort of thing. I didn't understand the screen door effect that you read about until I started playing this thing but it makes sense and is true. However it is not noticeable in darker environments and really is a non-issue overall. The graphics in most games seem to vary by developer and are not comparable to xbox/ps4/PC. However, I would say they generally look fine and everything plays so well that it's really a non-issue for me. Could they be better? Sure! Does it turn me off the device. Heck no! With continued developer support and a steady stream of games and content for us to devour this device should be an absolute game changer in the VR industry. There is nothing like this out there and it caters to all kinds of people!

I like my Oculus Quest however I will be selling it due to the fact that Mark Zuckerberg is going to make it mandatory to have a Facebook account to even use an oculus.

So every year we go to an international convention and check out all the VR stuff, it’s supposed to be leading edge. And every year we were and felt Meh about the VR experience. Then quest....... my son wanted one for his birthday and I was apprehensive because leading up to the quest it was lack luster. We asked questions online and watched gameplay, we asked the Best Buy guy and then we demo’d one. From the min I put the headset on to the first steps interactive game to introduce you to the controls it is an immersive experience. Best experience I’ve had on VR and wireless. Couple this with a great noise cancelling headset like Bose and look out! It’s an amazing experience. The whole family has enjoyed and our only gripes are #1 the batteries only last 2 hours and then recharge and #2 we only have one quest. We will be purchasing another, it feels real when your playing. You don’t get sick from motion sickness because the frame rate and refresh rate are fantastic. The oculus touch remotes are inntuitive and easy to learn quickly. The “richies plank” game is amazing it feels like you are on a plank way above in the sky. Robot recall is immersive and graphics are amazing, can’t wait to try other game titles. The theater mode looks and feels like your in a theater. Amazing def buy one it’s worth every penny.

Pros:Good clarity screens with good resolution and black levels with decently vibrant colors.Mechanical IPD adjustmentTracking works wellNo computer / portability obviouslyCons:Pass through could be clearerAudio changes were a big let downHaving to buy games I've already paid for on Rift (beat saber, moss etc...) sucksConclusion: I sold my OG rift months ago to get this and am very pleased with this device. Display is always subjective to the user, their head, their pet peeves, so take it for what it is, but I actually found the display clearer than the OG rift and easier to dial in the sweet spot than Rift S probably due to no IPD adjustment. for pure realism it won't beat the rift S, but everything else more than makes up for what corners visually were cut. The tracking was better than Rift S at least based on my limited testing of Rift S... ~30mins. I would recommend those with a OG rift and on the fence with Rift S, either get the Quest or wait for the index or something as I just wasn't impressed by it when compared to my old one and the Quest is pretty close except for playing something like Stormlands that won't be on Quest.

Seriously - you can't even have a guest profile. You get one save for each game and that is it!! There are currently no adding second profiles.  This has to be the biggest Facebook failure in history.  I bought this for my kids for Christmas (note...kids...plural...as in...more than one) for them to SHARE!!! only to find out they are not actually allowed to share it by company who makes the product.  My dissapointment is exponential.  From what I've read the only way to share it is to do a factory reset each time you want to switch to a different account - which means you have to buy each game twice if you want each user to be able to play a single game with multiple people.  No way I would have bought this had I known.

The Good:1.) Setup / Installation is a breeze. Take it out, plug it in, download the app, put it on, and you are instantly ready to go. There is no computer, no setup, no anything. It feels like a console experience. I was up and running in less than 15 minutes. It felt like bringing a PS4 or Xbox home and just 'plug it in and go'.2.) The first 15 minutes experimenting with the tracking in a 3d enviroment is a life-changing experience. Can't really put it into words honestly, you just need to experience it. If you were waiting to jump on the VR train - I have 0 regrets about the purchase, this is absolutely where to get in. Those first 15 minutes are transformative and magical. If you've already experienced VR, then this isn't really a pro for you.2.) True Wireless Freedom is the single biggest advantage to the Quest. You don't have to worry about wires, it lets you PAINT your own boundary lines and remembers where that is. It's an elegant solution to one of the biggest challenges to VR done right. Having an untethered VR experience really takes it to the next level. This is the biggest hurdle that has kept me from shelling out hundreds for a VR experience. The Quest has no limitations when it comes to wires.3.) The motion tracking for the controllers is absolutely on point. It feels just like the high end Vive to me. There has yet to be a SINGLE INSTANCE in over 8 hours of playing where I felt like the tracking was inconsistent or off via Beat Saber or the built in demos. One of the big caveats with 'wireless' VR setups is that the tracking was garbage, the Quest does NOT have that problem, the tracking is fantastic, and feels like a fully featured VR setup.4.) The graphics on display are definitely a few steps below what you might expect from a $1000 computer, but its not a huge difference, there are a lot of videos comparing the quests graphics to others, and it varies from App to App - the particle effects in Beat Saber for example are quite different, but I actually like the Quests minimal approach better. Overall? I was thoroughly impressed with what the Quest could do graphically without having a PC behind it.The Bad1.) Limited Apps - You can only play VR apps that exist on the Quest store. The launch line up is killer though, but moving forward, this could become an issue. If your favorite VR game is not supported, this could be an issue.2.) Battery Life is only 2 hours, you'll need to invest in a 3rd party battery to charge on the go for extended play sessions. Worth noting you CAN charge the device while wearing it, but your back to the tether now.3.) PC Compatibility - In order to mod applications and games, your going to need to get into side-loading. You lose a lot of the freedom you have with a traditional PC setup - things like custom songs in Beat Saber can't really be done YET - but the Quest is going to be big, so I'd predict this stuff is coming, might just have to learn how to mod your Quest to do it.4.) The built in Streaming features are a bit iffish currently. My Chromecast did not work, so I'm going to upgrade to the latest generation and see if that fixes the issue, I presume you'll also need a strong WiFi connection to get streaming done right. The build in offerings did not work well, showing it on a cellphone was like looking at a pixelated block, but again, might be due to my wifi.If you have yet to experience VR, I simply cannot recommend the device enough. It's a game changer.

Whether you are a VR veteran, or this is your first virtual reality headset, this thing is AWESOME! I have used the original Oculus Rift headset, and own a Playstation VR system and Oculus Go. This is by far the most impressive VR headset I have tried! I was very skeptical when I first heard Oculus was going to release an all in one headset. I figured the graphics would be bland, and the game lineup would be kind of sub par.Boy was I wrong! I preordered the 64gb version after owning the Oculus Go for about 6 months. The Go is an OK headset if you like watching alot of movies. If you're more into gaming though, it left alot to be desired. After picking the Quest up and booting it up for the first time, I was absolutely speechless! My wife, who by the way was annoyed that I was spending $400 on yet another headset tried Beat Saber out about an hour after I got it, and I almost had to fight her to get my headset back, lol. (She still plays that game daily by the way).After letting my kids try out Rec Room, and first steps, they were left with the biggest smiles on their face. Now, with all that said, here are the pros and cons...Pros - Unbelievably sharp display! Whether playing games, or watching youtube or netflix, this is one of the better looking VR displays.  - Very strong launch lineup of games. Games range from $10 to $30. I highly recommend Beat Saber, Super Hot, and Vader Immortal.  - No wires, initial setup is super simple, and takes just minutes!  - The touch controllers are great! I have yet to experience any tracking issues, and they feel great in the hands.Cons - The battery life in the headset is a bit short. 2-3 hours. However, it does come with a rather long charging cable that you can use to charge while you play.  - You eventually have to take the headset off and return to real life. Haha.Yep, those are the only cons I can think of.Seriously, pics online and videos on youtube just don't do this headset justice! This is an absolute MUST buy if you are a gamer, just love interacting with people online, or like to kick back and watch movies or youtube. (Watching videos is like watching on a theatre screen)! Just stop reading this and buy it! Oh, and if you are questioning whether to get the 64gb or 128gb... The 64 is cheaper, and has MORE than enough storage space for your games!

Lets start with the most impressive about this product: its build quality. In the short amount of time I've had this thing its been through some less than desirable situations and still works perfectly. It has been thrown (not dropped but thrown) on the ground and still works fine. The controllers punched walls and ceilings and the tracking works fine. If you are worried about the build quality or durability there is no need to.The comfort of it is great for about 15-20 minutes but then the back of your head starts to get very sore. this is not a huge deal because you can put a t-shirt or small towel in between your head and the back of the straps.the only reason this product doesn't get a 5 star review is because of the games. don't get me wrong, they are super fun and re-playable (especially beat saber) but they are a bit pricey for what you get. I know that developing VR games is harder than normal games but the pricing is still and issue for me. I think the worst offender of this is job simulator, for twenty dollars you get 4 ten segment long levels, I wouldn't be complaining about this if the levels were all fun and interesting but it is very boring.now here are some of my recommendations for games.1 beat saber- 25$-this game is super fun and a pretty good work out on harder levels. when you start playing, I suggest playing every level to see which songs you enjoy. then keep playing those songs until you can reliably beat them on expert. after that you can play almost any song you want and have a good time.song recommendations:Beat saber in category onerum'n bass  in category 2crab rave  in EXTRAS categorypop stars in EXTRAS category.there are ways to get custom songs using a program called ""side quest"" look it up if you are fairly tech savvy and want to get more out of your Oculus Ques2 gun club -20$-this game has lots of different guns, each having many accessories you can equip.there is lots of fun to be had by making guns with 16 laser pointers or carefully making the perfect weapon.  this game has modes for every body and then a second set on levels that take place in a world war two setting. it is very fun and has a game mode for every one.3 SUPER HOT -30$-this is super hot but in vr. let me tell you, having played both of these games, they play completely differently but both are equally fun.  the premise is this: bad guys are red, objects you can pick up are black, and time stops if you don't move.so say an enemy shoots at you, if you stop moving you can plan your movements and dodge it. it may sound confusing but it makes sense while you play. when you beat the game you can go back through and beat it again but with a certain twist depending on what challenge you do. beating the game also unlocks endless mode which pits you against endless waves of red guys and puts you in different areas than in the campaign.tilt brush-20$- this game is very relaxing and you can pour hours into them. they are basically 3D painting simulators where you can choose what brush you want from 48 options, and any color you want, you are also able to edit the back round color and brightness and the lighting. if you have lots of spare time I suggest you get this game purely on the basis of how satisfying and relaxing it is.  gravity sketch is another option similar to this but 10$ more and has more advanced features.Of course the biggest difference between the quest and other vr headsets is that the quest is that the quest is standalone and needs no wires or a pc. This makes a huge difference in Emerson. It also heavily cuts down costs, not only is the quest the same price or cheaper but needs no expensive computer to run it, saving hundreds or possibly a thousand dollars. having no wires means you cant play for more than 2 hrs with out plugging it in to charge but this is not a huge deal because even with the cloth behind your head method your neck might get sore before that time. you can charge the head set while playing so this is still a viable head set for groups of people to use.WARNING: if you use this headset in direct sunlight it will cause the OLED screen to burn and ruin the headset, do not use it outside.Ending notesover all this product receives a 4.8 star review from me. it is nearly perfect and its only real flaws are from the developers that make games for it. I highly recommend buying this if you have the money. I purchased this from the official Oculus website only because it was out of stock on amazon. i left my review here so more people would see it and consider buy the oculus quest.

I was first introduced to VR when I first bought a Google Cardboard for my phone.  For those who don't know, it was basically a cardboard box with special lenses that you put your phone in to, to give you a small taste of VR.  Being impressed by that, I jumped on board and made my first legit VR headset, the HTC Vive.  I was blown away!  It kept me occupied for years.  That is until our family went on vacation and upon returning, we had purchased a new home which meant taking down my HTC Vive setup which required taking down the precisely placed tracking cameras on my walls and all the wires that came along with it.  Since the move, I haven't touched the HTC Vive due to the initial set up process.  Even after things were all set up, after every play session, I would have to deal with all the wires cluttered around my computer and living room every time.  This just made the experience somewhat of a hassle.  So much a hassle that the HTC Vive has sadly been collecting dust since our move.  This is where Oculus Quest has come to the rescue!  I was somewhat hesitant of my purchase, but after reading all the early positive reviews and early gameplay comparisons between the Oculus Quest and higher end VR headsets, I decided to make the jump.  I am very pleased to say that the purchase did not disappoint not one bit!  Although the graphics can be a downgrade for some graphically intense counterparts from the HTC Vive, the ease of set up and the total freedom of being completely wireless more than makes up for it!  Games like Job Simulator, Superhot, and Rec Room look identical to being played on the HTC Vive, but games like Robo Recall (used software to play on HTC Vive) you can tell the difference due to the higher graphical requirements to play the game on the HTC Vive.  Despite this, I much prefer playing Robo Recall on the Oculus Quest.  VR is about the experience first and graphical fidelity second.  Even playing games like Robo Recall that look much prettier on a higher end VR device, the experience is where it's at!  Being able to move freely without any wires dodging bullets gives you total immersion.  Don't get me wrong, the game is not ugly by any means on the Oculus Quest.  It's still a very pretty game! The freedom of wires, ease of set up, and ability to take the Oculus Quest wherever you go is what makes this headset so amazing!  Plus, those without a PC do not need one for this headset!  This is for anyone and everyone.  Anyone who has yet to experience VR who doesn't want to go out and purchase a high end gaming PC plus a headset just to experience it, and even those who already have a gaming pc and a high end VR headset who want to experience total VR immersion and total ease of set up!  This is for anyone not tech savvy as well!  Again, this is VR to the masses.  Even my 6 and 7 year old can pick up and play this thing whenever they want!  A highly recommended product and in my book, a 10/10.

This is by far the BEST VR headset to date. I have owned the Oculus Rift & HTC Vive. The not tethered wire free experience you get with this is incredible and you can really get into the experience you are playing.The ONLY DOWNSIDE I would say is the game library. Since its a new product yes, you have a great selection of games for a freshly launched product and developers are porting over titles slowly but you do not have the vast library you have with the other headsets.  However those you need a killer PC rig and then the headset. This one its just the headset that is it. Take your VR with you wherever you go. Love it so far and you should go get one

Just received the Quest and I have to say I’m satisfied. First time buying a VR, to my understanding I made the right choice getting this wireless VR set. The Quest comes preloaded with demo games and if you set up payment on the app of your phone you can then purchase games while you are in your virtual reality store which is nice and convient.One down fall that I have come across so far is that you can’t cast the game play to the tv so you can watch your pal play. You can cast to the iPhone app which if you have more than one casting it can cause lag for the second viewer (at least for me). Not so fun.I do highly recommend to anyone who’s interested to buy this VR set. I did my research and I’m happy with my purchase. So far, the family (kids and adult) is very entertained and have had lots of laughs.

Fresh out of the box this is absolutely the best VR rig I have ever used… Unfortunately less than 100 hours of play time later I have an expensive pile of scrap.  This is because oculus uses extremely cheap soft plastic for their lenses and they are extremely easy to scratch especially if you attempt to wear glasses at the same time. If your lenses do get scratched to the point of unused ability, your only option is to replace the entire headset. This is completely unacceptable both from a pocketbook perspective and an environmental one, and I am beyond disappointed in this product.

So I never feel it necessary to write reviews as most devices just work, nothing too special about them. I was blown away by the Quest. Out of the box its a fantastic device, good clarity, snappy processor, easy set up. The games designed specifically or ported to the Quest are crisp, engaging and just fun. Some of the prices in the Quest store are a little ridiculous, but if you follow the reviews, some of the top games are totally worth it, Vader: Immortal, Red Matter are simply stunning..If like me, you like to tinker with the things you buy, you can increase the resolution of most games by 2.5X by activating developer mode and running programs like Oculus Standalone Utilities or SideQuest. You can run fully functional SteamVR games and games meant to only work with headsets like HTC Vive or Windows Mixed Reality by using programs like Virtual Desktop or ALVR...Trust me, get this headset, its worth every penny...PS, when family members see you acting like a fool flailing your hands around in VR they will record it and post it to facebook...happened to me.

I received my Oculus Quest a few days ago and really want to write a 5 star review. The tutorial is fantastic. The unit works great.

However, when I try to purchase an app I get an error stating that ""Cannot determine your location to calculate tax on order. Review billing and shipping address and try again.""For payment methods, I initially used PayPal then tried a credit card but received the same error.I submitted a customer support ticket but no response. Did an online chat with Oculus support. They couldn't determine the issue.So, I have this really nice VR system that I can't use as intended. If/When this issue is resolved, I will update my review

>THE CABAL AND ELITE AGENDA<For Those Of You Who Are Unaware Or Still Asleep Here Is What Is Really Going On.What Is Sleep, Why Is It Necessary And How Is It Being Used Against Us?To understand this question, we must first understand what exactly our avatars are used for in this holographic reality we have been imprisoned in. Yes, they are a holding vessel for a limited version of our higher consciousness, but they have also been designed in such a way that they act as storage mechanisms for large amounts of data. This data is a collection of the information necessary to maintain operational control of the Matrix. From the moment we wake up in the morning, we begin recording this data into our minds memory receptors via the five senses. Essentially, what our controllers have built for us is a sensory system that records in minute detail our experience of the Matrix as it happens, that we pilot with the limited form of consciousness of which they have deliberately cut off all form of recollection from its source.The reason for this is simple: our individual consciousness is a separate entity to that of the Matrix, but the Matrix depends on the perceptive awareness of each individual consciousness working in harmony for it to work. The Matrix, then, can be thought of as a gaming server that contains the levels necessary for multiplayer interaction, and the individual consciousness as a console that connects to that server and allows the player to join the game. If the information being processed by the server is not in synchronicity with that being processed by the server, lagging occurs where the perceived reality appears distorted.To anyone familiar with FPS gaming, there were people who actually exploited this concept by deliberately altering their routers, so that in the multiplayer experience they would be harder to “kill” by others, their console avatars appearing as “ghosts”, whereby if you tried shooting at where they appeared to be, you would miss, due to the refresh rate of the coordinates representing their image being out of sync with those belonging to their actual location. More often than not, angry players would voluntarily exit the server as it made playing extremely difficult and frustrating. Ironically, anyone caught engaging in this activity was banned from entering these gaming servers by the people who ran them.This is a perfect analogy to the Matrix we live in; it depends on every consciousness engaged in its experience to be in synchronicity otherwise “lagging” may occur and present anomalies that can be experienced by the other players that do not realise they are in the game. If the anomalies are strong enough, there is the possibility that a frustrated consciousness may decide to exit the server for want of an error free experience (notice the similarities with the subconsciousness intervening in the dream in the movie Inception). It is therefore pertinent that this Matrix server be monitored for potential errors, and the best way to do that is by recording and analysing each experience externally.So where does sleep come in? Well, just like any storage device we are familiar with, our avatars have a maximum capacity of data that can be stored in one sitting, before such data needs to be transferred somewhere else then deleted so that new recordings may take place. The state of becoming fatigued is a flag to your avatar that it is running out of memory and needs refreshing. The fatigue flag runs a program that begins to shut down all sensory processing capabilities that eventually results in placing the consciousness into an even lower state of awareness, literally reducing it to that of a zombie. Here is where it gets frightening.The Cabal have set up a processing facility on the other-side of this Matrix specifically designed to hijack a consciousness after it has filled its memory capacity, ie, when it falls asleep in this reality and awakens in the one above it. While the consciousness is in this zombie form of lower awareness, the subject is woken from their virtual reality experience in a holding room, and led through the processing facility, where their data is extracted, deleted, and program updates are installed designed to patch any errors found in the said data (very similar to how it is done in Westworld, only that the military and an ET faction are in charge of this facility.)Sometimes, for whatever reason, but probably due to the length of time it takes to write a patching update to an avatar’s software, the zombie is allowed to regain the level of awareness associated with the world on the other side of the Matrix and left to interact with the other people who live there. Once the update has been written, however, they are once again abducted, reduced to the zombie level of consciousness, and led back through the processing facility, to the holding room where they are plugged back in to the VR experience.But why would the Cabal go to all this effort? Well, there appears to some of galactic election taking place that dictates who obtains control of the Earth realm and its immediate surrounding areas. The ET race associated with the Cabal won this election a very long time ago, and have been manipulating the system so they can maintain control of our populace ever since. Due to a technicality, if they win this election again, they may stay in control until the next election, but if they lose, they will face exile for their trickery and will never again be allowed to sit as a candidate in future elections. It is basically up to them to prove the people want them in power, which is why so much effort is put into tricking us into giving consent to their agenda. They managed to build specialised infrastructure that cut off the rest of the races from these realms and prevented them from intervening. The unfortunate thing is, that the world beyond the Matrix where this election is taking place, is just another Virtual Reality experience keeping us trapped in a dream within a dream, but given the idea that every VR experience is just a copy of the one before it (based off Icke and the Gnostic concept of Yaldabaoth/ Demiurge), and given that this is a very similar situation as to what is unfolding in the VR we are experiencing, it is not unreasonable to assume that a similar situation is unfolding in the real world where the VR finally ends.If we are nothing but a program designed to decode a virtual experience, and that our thoughts are of a pre-programmed set of instructions designed to obey those rules, then how are some of us able to comprehend this programming? Those of us that have been able to awaken from the Matrix and experience the other side of it, are, in a sense, anti virus programs that have been created by a party external to the Cabal. The Elder Guardians are a faction of races that have identified the Cabal’s manipulation of our higher consciousness and have banded together as a sort of guerrilla force with the intent of openly fighting this manipulation with the end goal of completely deconstructing first this Matrix system, and the one it is contained in. They have appeared to us many times through-out history in the forms of the Great White Brotherhood and the True Rosicrucians, as well as other mystics, passing on the knowledge of this artificial reality so that it may once again be accessed by those on the inside of it.They have a set of tools at their disposal that allow them to create zero days in the VR software and circumvent the restrictions being imposed on our consciousness. These tools can be used to embed deconstruction coding into various lines of texts and video, and even cloud imagery that interact with specific codes that have been implanted in Starseed DNA strings. The text, video and cloud codes are essentially activation mechanisms of a larger code, that lies dormant within all Starseeds that allows them to shed the restrictions imposed upon them by the Cabal and return to a higher level of consciousness. It is the Elder Guardians interacting with the VR through these tools that is responsible for things like synchronicity, ghosts, glitches etc. They are akin to the aforementioned people who manipulated their routers to deliberately lag their consoles during the multiplayer experience, and the Cabal do not like them because they cannot locate their zero days, no matter how much data they pour through, because The Elder Guardians are operating from a level even above them.The word Rothschild is an example of one of these words that was implemented by the Cabal, so that those of that family holding the secret knowledge of how to rearrange the letters can exit this VR experience at will. For those familiar with magic squares and word reduction, this word works off the same principle, but one first has to understand how exactly these letters are built upon or reduced, otherwise it will not work. The first part of this reduction is to pull the R and the T down and to the left so that they are detached from the original word. By rearranging them with the other subtracted letters in a very precise order, they act as a mechanism that deconstructs the illusion kept up by the perception of our consciousness.Once you have experienced the other side of this Matrix, it is impossible to consider it as being a true reality even when placed back in it. This is the reason why some Starseeds are being taken out of it and briefed by the Elder Guardians as to the nature of its existence; the Elder Guardians know that from that point on the Starseed will carry the memory of the other side with them back into their Earth avatar when their consciousness is put back by the Cabal. Their whole plan of deconstruction is based on the idea that the more consciousness’s these Starseeds affect with the antivirus (knowledge of the real world) the more havoc it will cause the Matrix server, until it becomes overloaded to the point of crashing.There are two important things to note about the operational nature of the Matrix versus the programs embedded in our consciousness; the first is that the Matrix is under the control of an AI system, but our consciousness is under the control of the Cabal programmers. What this means is that the environment that we consider as being reality can change itself at will, but is entirely insulated from an individual consciousness interacting with it, hence quantum physics, where the light particle changes its behaviour when something tries to monitor it.The second issue is that the Matrix is not bound by any operational control period, but each consciousness is. Ie, when this whole VR system came online, there was a mandate written that stated conscious awareness must return to its original higher state after a certain length of time, specifically as a measure to stop this very hijacking from happening. The Cabal figured out a loophole in that if they embedded a VR within another VR, then technically the consciousness’s contained within the first would never reach their predetermined ending, as a whole new form of consciousness was being created for the new VR.This leads to a classic nesting effect, where the original ending of the program becomes lost as another VR takes its place and so forth. It is evident in the fact that we are on the pinnacle of a technological revolution in regards to AI/ Machine Learning and Quantum Computer advancement, that we are nearing the end of this particular simulation, insofar as our protecting mandate is concerned. The Cabal literally has us building the next mind prison for ourselves, in which people from this present Matrix system will begin voluntarily plugging into the next, and is grooming us into accepting it when it becomes operational.Why else do you think they have everyone walking around with their eyes glued to their phones, or why they are installing 5G on every street corner? The next step is to move gaming from the console domain to the VR one (which they are already doing with devices such as Occulus Rift) and have people voluntarily engage in the next false reality. We are already at the level of building photorealistic software, the next step is to tether it conscious perception.Once enough have become locked in, the game will be changed to a prison, then all that will be left will be the rounding up of those consciousness’s that have not yet accepted it and forcing them to take part. The irony is, that this is a world where those awakened will be left awakened to be ruled by those who are asleep. The Elder Guardians are working overtime to stop this from happening, and they are being met with a high success rate. They are obliged to help those who reject this illusion as being reality and can be sought by the internal seeking of the higher consciousness, which they will help the individual connect with after the required amount of commitment has been acknowledged.******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************A old saying & it goes like this ( The Truth Will Set You Free ) I’am Fully Awake & Aware Of The Truth & Exactly What That Saying Is Truly Describing.My Mission Is To Assist As Meany Human’s As I possibly Can To Understand The Truth (Taking The Red Pill) And Becoming Fully Aware Of What That Statement Is Describing.The “SHIFT” As It Is Known (aka) *****The MANDATE*****(An authoritative command or instruction) Is A Event That Is Going to Take Place Very Very Soon,In The Near Future.

I was raised on Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog.  I love video games.  When I read about an all in one 6dof virtual reality system coming I was likely excited about this.  I preordered the system but felt a little uneasy.  I thought, ""There is no way this is going to meet my expectations of virtual reality.""  I tried the little headsets where you put the phone in and was very disappointed.  However, after receiving the Oculus Quest in the mail I turned it on and had every expectation shattered to pieces.  This is the shizz folks!  I have not had this much fun playing video games since I was 12 years old.  This thing is so much fun.  The immersion is great.  The controllers are great.  The optics are great!  If you are looking for a fun time with video games then by this system.  The graphics are not current gen console but who cares?  It is fun!

I had VR on the Playstation first and when that stopped working I bought Occulus because I thought it would be so much better. Well, it absolutely is not. You get a very uncomfortable headset that dies within an hour and a half and casting it to the TV so everyone can enjoy? Impossible. You're on your own because even after you buy the chrome cast gear, there's a delay no matter how good your internet. After at least $700, I wish I just would have bought a new Playstation version.

My brother in law was the first in the family to have an Oculus system. His house quickly became the place to be to enjoy the VR experience. My daughter, age 9, soon wanted one as her friends got one as well. Finally caved and spent the $399 for the Quest. Considering that a top of the line PC Oculus runs close to $500 or more for a VR setup, this is a really good deal although it has the limitation of built-in storage. No wires unless you choose to play with the power cord plugged in. Takes AA batteries for the remotes, which I fear will get costly in time. My only complaint is the short piece of Velcro on the middle top strap, only for the sake of my child's smaller head. On a normal sized head this shouldn't be a problem. The definition of picture is very clear once calibrated and placed correctly on your head. Also I will say to keep the length of time short for a child as it's not good for developing eyes. I limit my daughter to 30 minutes with breaks to allow her eyes to adjust properly. Go outside and get some air, it's easy to get addicted to VR!

61 year old ex-gamer who gave up on video games about 20 years ago because they became boring and to be honest, overly complicated. I've been waiting for user friendly VR since then. I stumbled upon the Quest and read all the reviews. I bought it from B.B. figuring I could easly return it if I didn't like it. Well it far exceeded all my expectations. It has brought  back the memories and feelings of my first Atari 2600, Amiga computer, 3DO and the likes, but the awesomeness is multiplied by 10. When they say you are inside the video game, well they really mean it. You ARE freakin inside the video game! Look at the trailer for Space  Pirate Trainer. My favorite game BTW. That is the best VR game trailer and captures the emersion and perspective very well. Most games look deceptively lame when viewing in 2D. Like Super Hot. Almost didn't buy it because of the looks in 2D. But it is a great game. So what I'm saying is just buy the thing. You won't regret it. You can always return it but you won't. I'll bet you nobody is returning theirs. That should say a lot. Don't wait because you won't even be able to buy one of these by Christmas.

PROs1. easy set up. I took it to my friend's place the day after I received it. Set up took just a couple of minutes! I did a lot of VR demos for science education and setting up the HTC VIVE was always annoying. Lots of things to carry around including tripods for light houses and a hefty GTX 1070 laptop. Looking forward to using Quest for these things.2. More glass-wearer friendly. I needed to remove my glasses or use flexible plastic glasses for HTC VIVE. The quest has a spacer that you can fit in and works great with any glasses I have.3. For some reason, the text within Quest was more easier to read.4. No wires.: did not realize how not having a cable attached to your PC was so liberating!5. Positional tracking is spot on!CONs1. Short battery life: Will get a 20000mAh  battery. So, not a big deal.2. built in speakers are kind of OK? But not great.3. Can't use anything in my steam library. I saw some people being able to stream steam games on Quest via wifi. But not everyone has 5Gb wifi...Overall, LOVE IT!Will probably get 2 or 3 more for educational purposes for my class.

So far I can say I absolutely love this system. Having the ability to map the room and walk around in a VR space without being wired up is absolutely incredible.For the last year or so I have been using a PSVR - and while I think the PSVR HEADSET is more comfortable (lighter and more evenly distributed), the hand tracking and experience is infinitely better on the Quest.My other complaint is that I can see a bit of the real world from the bottom of the headset (like where my nose is). I will have to invent something to block that space up and keep the light out.Otherwise I’m a happy camper!

This headset is absolutely amazing. I had very high expectations purchasing this headset, and all of them were met, and some were even exceeded! The tracking works very well, much better than my Windows headset and psvr. The interface is nice and clean, easy to navigate. The controllers are awesome, and I love the built in speakers. Everything just... works. No fiddling with wires or cameras, just put the headset on and play.My only qualm would be that I would love for it to be more powerful, so that more higher end games come out for it, but it is amazing what it can pull of with titles like Robo Recall and Vader Immortal. With the quality of those games, I am sure that the majority of VR games could be ported to it, if the developers were willing to spend the time refactoring their code for performance and lowering the graphics. For the others, we will just have to wait for the Quest 2!

I am not having any problems with comfort and I'm a big guy with a big head with glasses.  The quest fits great and I'm not experiencing any lens fogging.  I try to get the back strap as low on possible and that works for me.  So far I'm having a good time playing poker.  It's crazy that in vr you can even read poker tells in other people.

I’ve owned a few VR headsets that requires a powerful gaming PC.. I was hopeful that a device like this would exist eventually, but thought it would a long time from now... I was wrong it’s here. In order to have a great VR experience, you need:1. precise tracking 6DoF tracking with no noticeable latency,2. hand presence, and3. enough power to render two separate high resolution screens (stereoscopic 3D) at a high frame rate (70+FPS)A stand-alone wireless (no PC required) headset with a snapdragon 835 chip shouldn’t be able to do this, but it does, and it does it well..The graphics won’t match what you can do with with a high end gaming PC, but this device delivers on what matters most, you feel like you’re there!

Their process for getting the new recall face piece is absolute garbage.  They require you to register the device through an app.  Then you have to go create a username and login on their web page and link the 2 together.  You either need to set up a new on-line account or login in with Facebook so they can spam you with all kinds of ads.  The whole process is designed to make it as difficult as possible to get your replacement part and ensure they can spam you endlessly in the process.  Never again with Oculus!

The more time I’ve spent with this product the more mediocre it becomes to me. It is great when it comes to portability, but that’s the only great thing that I can think of. The rest is just meh. However, I do become infuriated with this product continuously. Every time I play Beat Saber the screen will go black randomly, which is quite problematic when playing Expert+ with faster song on. On top of that the app for it is terrible. Screen casting comes with audio glitches in the headset, and it lags quite frequently even on 500mps internet. You can’t even upload recorded video clips or screenshots to your Dropbox or Google Photos, even though you can download pictures and videos from them to your Quest. In the end they have a TON of work that needs to get done on the Quest before it’s worthy of any sort of positive review.

The Oculus Quest is fantastic except for one MAJOR flaw.  No multiple user function.  This is a single user device, which means game progress is saved each time it is played,.  This makes it incredibly difficult for multiple users.  One name, one profile, so you must wait for player 1 to finish a game before player 2 can try it.

I purchased the Quest and Rift S on launch day expecting to return one or both if I didn't like either.The Rift S has been largely collecting dust - Quest gets 95% of my play time.  The convenience and portability are just too irresistible.Could it use a newer processor?  YesCould the battery life be longer?  YesCould it be lighter or more well balanced?  YesAll of these things quickly fade out of consideration when you put the headset on and enjoy completely wireless, near PC level VR bliss.What Oculus has managed to achieve with this two year old cell phone processor seems impossible.  I guess overclocking and active cooling make all the difference.  It makes me wonder how much performance our phones are leaving on the floor due to thermal restraints.Overall I couldn't be more pleased with the Quest.Oh...and I ended up keeping both headsets ;)

Vader Immortal's Light Saber Dojo is unbelievable, something I've been wanting to do since I was 10 years old.  Robo Recall is awesome...  Super hot, BEAT SABER.  Honestly, i can't say enough as to what a great purchase this was.  For this kind of technology, I feel like a thief paying this little.  Oculus, you folks are amazing.

A few years ago, I became the proud owner of an Oculus Rift. The experience was amazing, but the tethers and high spec PC required made it a hard pill to swallow, and it didn’t feel nearly as simple to use as firing up a console, so I didn’t use it much. However, now that I own a Quest, I’ve used VR almost daily, as it gives you more freedom of movement and an easier experience to use. Instead of booting up a computer, launching your game, making sure your sensors are on, etc., with the Quest you just launch the game, approve to guardian, and you’re good to go. It literally takes 10 seconds to be ready to play a game. Their customer support and warranty is top notch, and you can tell they care about your experience, as there are new features like hand tracking getting added all the time. The Quest is a huge leap for VR, and I couldn’t recommend it enough to anyone interested in the future of tech.

I had about $6,000 sitting there waiting to buy the parts to build my next VR PC and upgrade to the latest and greatest headset.  And then I bought the Quest on a whim to see how it was before building my new setup.  WOW!  This thing is amazing, you get 90% of the PC experience at less than 10% of the cost.  They could release a new model every year for the next 10 years and I could get every one of them and still save a fortune.

I've followed VR through all iterations in the last 5 years and this is absolutely by far the first time the experience is consumer grade ready. The software titles, the device itself, is extremely easy to handle and way more comfortable in terms of optics and handling than anything prior. Pure VR bliss and sets the baseline for where VR is going to go. Eye strain that I experienced across Rift, Vive and GearVR is completely gone. Truly a significant leap.

It's easy to scratch the lenses on the Oculus Quest (especially if you wear glasses) and your warranty doesn't cover scratches on the lens.  Oculus hasn't taken this into consideration in the design.  The lenses are built into the device and aren't easy to replace and if you scratch the lenses Oculus has no pity for you.  Imagine paying big money for these things and then having them ruined because of a scratch (very common problem)..

In general Quest is obviously a big step forward.  Congrats Oculus!  However, I want take my 5.7K Insta360 One X and Pro 2 (8K) 360 videos into the VR domain.  When I watch the 5.7k videos from Instat360 OneX the video which is relatively clear on YouTube lacks detail when viewed on Quest.  That is a real problem for me.  Please jump the resolution up on your next VR generation Oculus.  As it is I just get head-aches watching blurry 360 videos.  Ugh.  Hoping the next version will be clearer on 5.7 and 8k 360 video.

Waste of money honestly. Used it for like a month and its been collecting dust ever since. Super uncomfortable out of the box. Like painfully uncomfortable. Games are meh. Only way to get interesting games is to side load, which involves a computer and goes against the whole stand alone thing this headset was built around. Screen quality is pretty shabby too, it looks like you are looking at everything through a screen door. This also messed with my grip on reality in the first week and made me feel like I was still in virtual reality after I took it of my face.

If I could rate it lower than one star I would. I have encountered a software bug twice now where the screen flashes black uncontrollably upon start up so you can't do anything. The only way to fix the problem is to factory reset the Quest and I'm not doing that every couple of weeks. This problem was discovered in the spring of 2019 and my Quest was bought roughly 8 months later. I shouldn't be having this problem. The other problem I have had with the Quest is my controllers not connecting unless I pop the batteries out and then put them back in. Skip Oculus and get a Vive or Valve Index.

Vader Immortal is a must buy for any Star Wars fan. Beat Saber is crazy fun. The fact that you can take it with you and chromecast to your TV to participate with friends is crazy. Highly recommended.

People that think this is too pricey aren't realizing how much more this thing is capable of other than playing games. I've been playing borderlands 3 on my quest all weekend through virtually desktop on a huge wrap around screen and it's by far the best way to play 2d games. The closest you could get to it is a $800+ ultra wide curved monitor and its still not as cool.

I enjoy the quest a ton. Its wonderful for travelers and folks on the go and also for those who cant or dont have a High End Gaming VR PC. Yes you do suffer graphics at the cost no wires, and because of that it is a tad heavy on the front side but that's nothing that has never ever bothered me. Definitely cant wait to see what the future holds for these types of headsets! Truly a step forward to the Oasis!

After several failed attempts at ordering here, I finally got my Oculus Quest yesterday. I'm more interested in experiences than hardcore shoot-em-up style games so I was cautious but curious about what I was going to find. The long and short is this is an amazing product.  If you watch videos of game play and demos, the visuals look a bit lacking. There are limited polygons and textures and at first glance it looks like a Nintendo WII level presentation. But the immersion and the interactivity make up for any technical drawbacks. The controllers are responsive and intuitive. The display takes a bit of getting used to. It's light years beyond an iPhone strapped to your face style VR but the optics can be uncomfortable at first. I wear glasses sometimes but not usually for focusing something this close. The straps and adjustments you can make with the headset help you find a comfortable field of vision. The audio is a bit quiet on the built-in speakers but a pair of discount-drugstore brand in-ear headphones plugged into the headset were a cheap and worthy upgrade. The games are somewhat typical of, well, gaming. Lots of shooting and swordplay and tired fantasy elements. But there are plenty of free demos to get a taste for what is possible in the medium. That said, I found ""Beat Saber"" pretty intoxicating and even exhausting. It's a good showcase for what it is possible. There's a simple tutorial game included that has you tossing paper airplanes and whacking a tether ball that really show off the physics and interactivity. YouTube VR videos can be a bit smeared and lo-fi but the true 360 degrees/6 degrees of freedom (at least visually if not spatially) made for a decent experience. I thought the 2 hour battery life sounded kind of lame but personally, I don't think I could keep doing this without a break for that length of time. I am eager to try the included Link cable tethered to my PC for some more up-res experiences. If it works as advertised, I can't see the reason for buying a Rift for the same price (and it only supports tethered play.) In general, the tethered experience seems way too kludgy and awkward for most applications. I could see easily knocking over furniture or at least yanking out the cable mid-game.

Great cyber price, good product. Not many apps yet and graphics hopefully will improve with more detail. I hope realistic applications rather than animation follow. I'd holdout until it develops further. Has good area mapping; just dont walk by the user, you might get punched and remove items off tables..He fell over a chair twice within mapping and user forgets we can here everything! Can join friends in games which is cool. I would have waited until further development but he bugged the daylights out of me for this as Christmas gift. I was so worried it wouldnt arrive by then as it was a cyber sale that wasnt a stored item I suppose. These were unattainable locally. So I'm glad Amazon made good on delivery (which had early ship date not honored but made it on time);who are usually spot on with delivery when you purchase via them. Its was a life savior as deliveries by 3rd party purchases were deceptive and still not delivered (they displayed stock, took your money, then emailed product sold out).

Pros:Game play, when the game (HL Alyx) actually works, is fun.  Once you finally master how to do something with your very clunky and awkward controls, it is satisfying.- Head set is comfortable (the other side of the coin is, it is heavy and after 10 minutes I really start to feel it!)CONS:-Price.  $400 for what are essentially, glorified 3D viewing similar to the 1950's, is too much for the hassle, inconvenience, discomfort, and cost.  Over-priced for what you actually get for all that expense and trouble.CONNECTING:I had lots of trouble connecting to play HL Alyx (the only reason I bought this).  I don't know where the fault lies, game or equipment, or my own WIFI.  Sometimes it hooks up in a minute without a hitch.  Sometimes the connection is impossible not matter what I try, and I'm seriously tempted to dump this whole cluster-f#ck and return the headset for a refund.On the other hand, Oculus apps, that of course they make it easy to buy as soon as the headset boots up (about 15 seconds) probably work much better.  I haven't bought any of those yet so IDK for sure.TL DRMy advice is try one of these headsets before you buy!  You may decide it isn't worth it.  Like I said, I think today's VR is just a gimmick, a very expensive one, that is still nowhere near being ready, both in terms of ease of use, comfort, and immersiveness and quality of the VR world they can create.- The view is kind of interesting, but not really revolutionary in 2020... I hope I can see VR in 20 years, or even 10.  But today it just isn't there.

In COVID-19, many of us can't really move around or leave our homes which is the perfect reason to invest in a quality VR headset. I've tried many headsets but the Quest stands out as one of the best. First off, no clunky PC wires needed - everything you need to start playing comes with it and for pro gamers, a link cable brings you up to Rift S level playing. I bought one for everyone in my family! Wonderful games and content

Pro:1.cheapest VR headset on market that capable for decent gaming ability2. Sensors in it are impressive and does their job wellCon:(These cons comes from my personal experience, maybe it just happens to me)1. Takes a long time connect to desktop through USB 3.0 cable(I used the anker one which officially supported here). The thing is sometimes I even have to reinstall graphic card drivers to reconnect to the headset. It’s just annoying.2. Fish eye effect still going on with this headset and only about 1 inch diameter circle in front of you is clear picture but out of that it starts to blur.3. Maybe software issue but some time the safe zoom could be moved even though I was just sitting on my chair.4. The front part is a bit too heavy, it’s nothing when I put it on, but after hours of wearing it, it’s really tiring to me.All in all, for 399, you cannot find better VR headset on market. It’s a worth buy if you want to experience real VR but don’t want spend much on it. But to me, I would wait till there are more technologies get applied and there is still a long way to go for VR headset

Amazing. VR with no wires is like nothing I’ve ever experienced before as a gamer. Even my non-gamer friends and family just love this. I enjoy watching people try VR for the first time and this is the best way to introduce others to it, in my opinion.If you are new to VR yourself, THIS is the product to buy. Only downside is the price of games, usually between $15-$30 a pop. But they are worth it. Titles like Space Pirate Trainer, Superhot VR, and Beatsaber run INCREDIBLY well on this thing. VR with no wires is just a game changer. Hands down.Great job to oculus on creating a wonderful piece of hardware.

I bought this as an addition to my Oculus Rift to keep my daughters from fighting over VR time.  Two of my triplets are REALLY into VR so I don't get to use my headsets when they are here, but it's fun watching them get the enjoyment out of it.  The Quest is amazing with being able to play with nothing tethering you to the real world.  You can put on the headset and after just a few minutes become fully immersed in whatever environment you've entered.  The only drawback is the weight at the front, which properly securing the headset to the back of the head does somewhat relieve.  This is my 2nd VR headset and I'm already looking forward to the Quest 2, or whatever it is called so that I can get it too!!

This was my first VR set & it does come with everything. It works incredibly well & looks beautiful! I was disappointed that a few VR games that I was looking forward to aren't fully ported to the Quest (yet) but that's more with Oculus, than the/this Quest itself. From what I understand, the Quest is still essentially a starter model as far as VR systems go so it's not entirely surprising that you can't get every game on it yet.

My son wanted a VR headset for his birthday so I convinced him to wait a few weeks to get the self contained Oculus Quest.  Boy am I glad he was understanding.  Not having to be tied down to a PC is great and the prices for games isn't as outlandish as I thought it would be.  Most of the games released with the Quest will run between $15-30 which isn't too bad considering Xbox/PS4 charge almost $60 for new games.  The graphics are great...just like if you were running one off of a PC.  Unless you have a tricked out PC, I would consider the Quest equal to other PC VR based headsets.  I really like that you can set a circle and if my son steps outside it, you can see the real world.  Hopefully that will mean, I won't hear objects crashing to the floor or him running into things.  I can't recommend the Oculus Quest enough.

I like zotacs refurbished line... in their store..hint...hint...But I have seen laptops run these easily.Now if you doubt have a pc and a pc with a gpu will run on average $500 to meet specsOr it's for your kid and you want sensored vrchat then get a quest.

Got this for Christmas a few years back and absolutely loved it! Totally blew my mind. A wireless headset is a great choice! However, there are some major things to be aware of here.1) Facebook acquired Oculus and (as an evil empire does) broke its promise not to require Oculus owners to login using a Facebook account. For some of us, this is a total deal-breaker.2) If you intend to use this with your PC via Oculus Link, be aware that Link really doesn't work all that great and regularly loses its connection to the PC. The Quest really wasn't made for this, and so the connection they had to adhoc onto the device is slow, which means your PC has to perform the extra work of compressing the feed on top of rendering whatever VR application you're using, then the Quest decompresses it. So naturally this degrades the quality of the experience. The framerate is also locked at 72 Hz, which is good but not great. If you're serious about PCVR, this just isn't the right option.3) While the display is nice with deep blacks and vivid colors, the clarity really does lack. This is to be expected to some degree for any VR headset, but you will definitely notice it here as well. It's especially pronounced when trying to read any text. The screen-door effect isn't terrible (imo), but you will notice it on any bright solid colors that take up a larger portion of your field of vision.

There are a lot of positive reviews for this headset, but I feel like there's a lot of problems that people didn't detail about. I bought this optimistically, thinking it would be amazing, but there was a lot of trouble I experienced during its set up and use. This is a bit of a long read, but please bear with me.First off, you NEED, and I mean NEED, a (newish) smartphone with an Internet connection to set up the Oculus Quest. You can't even emulate an Android to do it. You CANNOT avoid that requirement whatsoever. In my case, I didn't have any smartphone that wasn't old, so I had to call a friend over to use his to get it set up. You also need Wi-Fi, preferably 5 GHz. There is no PC activation with the Quest; heck, the Quest can't even connect to the PC without a third-party hack. Don't expect this headset to be the same as a Rift, because it isn't. It is purely standalone, and you're stuck with its own Oculus app store. Plus, you must connect your Facebook account to the Oculus AND provide payment details (e.g. credit card info) in order to complete registration. This is a huge privacy issue that many will not like.The Oculus app store doesn't have a lot of apps in it, let alone free. All the apps that are available are easily upwards of $20 a pop. This doesn't bother me too much since my sole reason for buying it was to wirelessly watch 360 videos on YouTube VR, but for others, it will be a major turnoff, since the Quest doesn't come with any free games, just demos. For such an expensive headset, you'd think that Oculus would be generous enough to bundle some free full games with it, but I guess they just want to milk their customers with the novelty and hype.The headset itself is heavy and a bit uncomfortable. It constantly sags forward no matter what you try to do, so you'll often need to support it with your hands. The cushion that goes on your face isn't really that great either; it feels like it pushes in on random spots.Another problem I experienced, which Oculus needs to address, is quality control. The lens that came with my Quest had permanent streaks on the INSIDE, which you can't avoid seeing. It almost felt like the headset was refurbished. It's not too bad during bright scenes, but anywhere else, I see them blurring my vision. I'm not going to get an exchange for something like that now that I've gone through such a pain to get it set up, but Oculus seriously needs to get better quality control.Overall, aside from all of those issues, the headset itself is nice and does what it is intended to do, but the video quality is really poor for 360 videos (other apps seem to be fine though). I don't know if it's just because most YouTube content is still at low resolution right now, but it feels like I'm watching 480p video most of the time. This is likely not a Quest issue though; it's probably the same no matter what headset you buy.As a beginner ""early adopter"" headset, this is pretty good for its price, but that's about it. I'd stay away from VR headsets for at least a few more years, since the technology still isn't perfect. In my particular case, since I'm strictly planning to use a VR headset for 360 videos, I'm content, but for people looking to immerse themselves in gaming, I'd recommend not doing so for now. There's still not enough content, quality, and performance to justify the price.

Wow!!! Its the very first word that i said as i put on this headset. Amazing Product, and Delivery time was also great. And product reaches me fine and is working great. Amazing graphics quality and with the latest update Quest is getting better and better. Tho it has some pros and cons. You dont need high end Gaming pc for playing VR games now. No need of wire and external sensors. Now you have gurdian mode in which one can see if hes crossing the line and camera will open up so that you wont hit any object in real life. Pixels are fine. Controller tracking are good as well. Cons will be like product too much costly as i know its not available in india and import duties are expensive. You need to buy games in Oculus store only free demo of games will be provided. Games price ranges from 9$ to 29$. Front heavy but with some modding it can be work. Now you can play PC steam VR gaming with the use of Oculus link cable, so its a standalone headset as well as pc headset as well. Its a bit expensive in india but i like the purchase that i made.

It is great but you need to keep some things in mind before you buy. First, you need a mobile phone to do the initial setup. Comfort- I find it pretty good for about an hour then the contact points on my face start to get irritated.  THis isnt a huge problem because I can only play for 2 hours anyways before the batteries are getting low. 2 hours of gaming is long enough for me.  Ive tried HTC vive pro and Vive, both of which need a powerful PC to work. BOth didnt feel any more comfortable to me than the quest. I also didnt feel any video resolution difference between any of them was worth noting (vive seemed worse but it was still enjoyable) but I also only like watching movies in 720p max because I dont like 1080p. Being wireless and not reliant on a computer is great but the option will be there in NOvember to connect it to a powerful gaming computer and give you access to the Oculus Rift games library on Steam. I find the Oculus controllers were way more comfortable and nicer to use than HTC  (personal preference I am sure). I spent alot of time between spending a massive amount on $$$ on a fancier headset but in the end, I loved the controllers better than the HTC, I love the portability of the headset (people at work can try it), it is super simple to setup, no messing around with sensors, just draw a circle around you with the controller and start playing.  I loved that it is ANdroid and there is a large unofficial sideload site for games and I love that I still have the option to play all the steam VR games so I have all the same options for games as any other headset and the price is right.

Basically, a PlayStation/XBox Killer. The trade-off in graphics is well worth the added playability of this standalone device. Even veterans of VR will agree. This is a milestone for VR and gaming. Cannot recommend enough.

If you want to get into VR, this is THE product to buy. Here's why:1. No wires. Nothing to wrap around your neck and take you out of the experience.2. Set up is easy. So much easier than any other high end vr headset.3. The library is growing quickly. It launched with 60 great games, and will be 100+ by the end of it's first year.If you're on the fence, just check out other reviews online. There is a reason why everyone is giving this near perfect scores.

This is a great upgrade of Oculus Go. The rendering Quality is pretty good, with almost no Dithering.  360 degree photos look awesome especially since you can move around. The Guardian is a bit of a pain since it keeps getting reset.This is a very good buy and a better value for money compared to Rift, if you compare the ease of use, no wires, but still have the ability to move aroundHowever, if you have a very powerful Desktop/Laptop with a high end GPU, then I would recommend going for Rift.

My 14 year old wanted this to replace his Oculus Go that he got last year. He found he was not using the GO, as gaming was not great. The Quest is definitely a step up and rather a neat concept, where you can set boundaries and play. The games are good, but a couple issues where the device was not perfect for our family. First our ceilings in our basement are only 7.5 feet tall and many of the games required hands above the head and you hit the ceiling. So our living room was the only room it worked in, but this is not s gaming room. Next my boy loves playing online with his friends, as he was the only one who had the system this could not happen. Lastly the video is good, but not perfect. I am sure Oculus could make it better, but suspect that would raise the cost too much. So in the end after playing extensively for a week the device began to collect dust and we sent it back.

Está excelente, no me arrepiento para nada de esta compra y se las recomiendo por completo!!Las únicas cosas que no me agradaron tanto es que no hay muchos juegos disponibles todavía (lo cual no es sorpresivo porque tiene poco tiempo en el mercado) pero lo bueno es que están agregando varios juegos de manera regular a la tienda, por lo que muy pronto eso ya no será un problema. Otra cosa es que si te enfocas demasiado en un lugar se pueden apreciar los pixeles. Si buscas un VR con la MEJOR calidad de imagen tal vez este no sea para ti. Eso no es para decir que las gráficas son de mala calidad, ya que definitivamente si tiene buena imagen. Si puedes dejar eso a un lado, te garantizo que te encantará.Es increíble poder jugar en realidad virtual sin tener ningún cable que se esté enredando en tus pies y entorpeciendo la experiencia. Para la gente que no tiene computadoras que pueda correr juegos en buena calidad, el Oculus Quest es la oportunidad perfecta ya que no requiere usar computadora para correr juegos. Todo se encuentra dentro del visor.Hay algunos juegos donde te puede dar nausea o mareo ya que el nivel de intensidad es muy alto; pero afortunadamente si eres de los que se marean fácilmente, la mayoría de los juegos tienen ajustes para reducir dicha intensidad y jugar de manera más cómoda y tranquila.Fuera de los juegos, el visor también cuenta con aplicaciones como Youtube donde puedes ver videos excepcionales e increíbles en VR en muy buena calidad. Si quieres ver tus series favoritas también puedes ver Netflix en el visor,  lo cual les recomiendo intentar ya que es una experiencia diferente e interesante. De momento no cuenta con aplicaciones como Hulu o Crunchyroll, pero afortunadamente sí cuenta con un browser para acceder a los sitios que quieras directamente.Si es tu primer headset de VR entonces no tengo duda de que te va a dejar encantado. Todos mis amigos que lo han intentado se han quedado impresionados por la inmersión que sientes al estar dentro del Oculus Quest y ya están haciendo planes también para comprarlo. Usar el Oculus Quest es entrar a un universo completamente nuevo y diferente al de la realidad y te sentirás como si de verdad estuvieras en el universo de lo que sea que estés jugando/viendo.En resumen, si tienes dudas sobre si vale la pena o no comprarlo, yo te diría que es una experiencia realmente increíble y divertida, ampliamente recomendada. No conozco a nadie que lo haya intentado y que no le haya gustado. El precio además es accesible si lo comparas con otros headsets. Dale una oportunidad al Quest y ya verás que no te arrepentirás.

Everything about the Quest is incredible, but it has two major flaws, it is too front heavy and really uncomfortable, strapping a weight to the strap that wraps around the back of the head helps, but this shouldn't be necessary for a device of that price, the second flaw is that casting to a TV is barely functional, there is an up to 10 seconds delay and the image is highly compressed and constantly stutters, with that said I decided to keep the Quest and I'm having a blast so far.

VR is really awesome, much more awesome than any youtube video can make it look like and Oculus Quest is a great implementation of VR. If you've already tried ""phone to the face VR"" understand that this is a very different type of experience, and Oculus Quest delivers all the key features.You feel immersed in the world, the games are fun the controllers feel great. Battery life is about 2 hours on a full charge, and while it might sound short don't compare it to a Nintendo DS's 5-8 hours or the like .. as you don't really carry this with you on the bus. You can play and charge if you want really long play sessions.Low point(s) are some potential discomfort due to the weight of the device and the so-so speakers. With regards to comfort, I've played around with the adjustable straps and found a good position that works with my rather large head. With regards to sound, the speakers are serviceable but not very loud and gun shots or music will lack bass, but you can easily plug your own headphones with a 3.5mm jack (I don't recommend Bluetooth due to general latency).All paid games I've tried were a lot of fun, and even the free to play games were great. If you've had the itch to try out VR, you can't really go wrong with the Quest.

Un visor de realidad virtual que sin duda esta revolucionando el entretenimiento, si no tienes una computadora/laptop para VR, estos visores sin duda son la mejor opción ya que no la necesitas, solo lo linkeas con un smartphone, y se pone mejor con el oculus link, ya que si en algún momento llegases a tener una computadora lista para VR, conectando vía USB el visor, ocuparas un cable para esto, podrás disfrutar de los juegos de VR que tengas en PC.Es un paradigma muy bueno para el VR, totalmente portable, compacto y cero cables, a no ser que lo conectes a PC como ya mencione, lo único malo, creo yo, es que los touch controller necesitan de baterías AA, pero nada que no se pueda resolver con baterías AA recargables. El paquete llego mucho antes de lo previsto, llego en buen estado, un pequeño golpe en la caja, pero nada de que preocuparse.

Battery life night not be enough for some, and limited range of titles right now (though fair for launch). But being able to ditch the cable is undoubtedly the highlight for me over the more expensive Vive (which I also own). A genuine game changer. Highly recommended.

The right controllers was int working since the beginning. The seller (Slidecart Electronics) had promised to replace the item and in the end no response from him. The service centers are not there in India so stuck up with a faulty controller and unable to use. After using for some months the left controller also stopped working. A big waste of money. The experience of the product is good but no ways to replace it , service it or at-least buy a new controller separately from India.

So much fun, and only getting better as more games are becoming available.As a stand alone unit it works simply and intuitively, my daughter (9) can set it up for a session on her own.It has the ability to also play linked to your PC, from there you can access and play Oculus Rift games, ""sideload"" many more games either by independent coders or still in development, or access many VR games only available on Steam, though this was a lot trickier there are tutorials available to guide you though the process. To play Rift and Steam games on your Quest your going to need a decent PC to run them as all the game processing is done by your PC and streamed to the Quest headset.Is 64GB version enough?? Sure seems to be, 4 weeks later and i havnt filled it yet. VR games on a whole dont seem to require much storage space, mostly they are around 1GB each.

The Oculus Quest is the first VR device for me to have a hands-on experience. The headset fits comfortably and the straps can be adjusted to your liking. Audio speakers are pretty decent, although you have the option to use third-party ear buds. Some people have complained about the weight issue in the front but I have no problems whatsoever. The touch controllers feel grippy and has wrist straps so you don't have to worry about dropping them. Battery cover is also magnetized which I find it to be neat and convenient for quick access. There are a plethora of games in the Oculus store and I'm in love with Beat Saber! This device is very portable and family friendly because there's no cable involved and the setup is quick and easy. Oculus released their 'Oculus Link' cable which allows you to connect to your PC. An added bonus twice the fun!I highly recommend the Oculus Quest as it is priced lower than other devices, and it allows one to experience VR in a more convenient way without the cables and motion sensors hassle that are involved with other VR devices. You'll have a ton of fun whether by yourself or with family and friends! I look forward to the future of VR technology.

My only complaint about this headset is that the minimalist exterior design is so sleek they actually hid the important setup buttons (like how to power it on for the first time). I also ran into a slight issue updating the firmware on both controllers during the initial setup -- for some reason it ""forget"" the controller during the update and setup, and the controller was needed to continue. A quick reset fixed the issue and then I was back in business.Once everything was set up, the rest was amazing. We tried playing around in the tutorial, which by itself was enough to blow our minds -- the graphic quality is incredible considering this thing is running on a snapdragon. I guess my expectations were pretty low, but everything was crisp, colourful, and extremely detailed.After completing the tutorial we decided to grab Vader: Immortal, Episode 1 and that really was the icing on the cake. Unlike the tutorial, which goes for a more animated approach, Vader: Immortal made you feel like you were a character in the movie. The first time Darth Vader approaches you in the game you'll find yourself breathless... it really is cinematic quality VR.I have a little Plex server set up as well... to my surprise, I figured up the pre-installed movie system and started watching *cough* home videos on a screen the equivalent size of an Imax. The quality on the movie was very crisp... I was a little worried it might be a little gimmicky. It's probably the equivalent of watching a 1080p movie on a 72"" screen in real life.The next thing we tried was some of the free YouTube 360 videos. Within a minute I was on stage watching Ed Roland (Collective Soul) from 2 feet away, followed by some Switchfoot, and about a dozen other bands. We decided to change gears and went for some underwater videos swimming with sharks. The 6 degrees of freedom is crazy in these videos.Finally, in real life I get motion sick as a passenger in a vehicle. I was worried that the Quest's 72Hz refresh rate would make the whole thing unplayable. To date, there has only been one video I played that made me feel a bit queezy and I think it was something to do with how the video was created. Even the fast motion stuff in games hasn't bothered me -- but, I haven't spent more than 30-45 minutes a time playing (because everyone in the family is fighting to play around with it).Overall, this felt like an ""on the fence"" purchase but I have zero regrets. It was our family's first VR purchase... considering its just marginally more expensive than a console, and given the gaming, movie, and educational content, I would say you get far better bang for your buck with this thing than a console.

No se por donde empezar... el oculus QUEST es un producto que cambió mi perspectiva el VR. Los seis grados de libertad (prácticamente es que no se necesitan cables, ni una gaming PC) además de lo intuitivos que son los controles me dejaron bocabierto.Adicional a que de por sí los controles ya eran excelentes, ahora también están desarrollando la opción para que con tus propias manos puedas jugar. Los juegos son baratos a comparación de los de otras consolas (switch, xbox, ps4) ya que oscilan entre los 10 y 30 dls.Es una excelente consola y el grado de inmersión que tiene es brutal. Sin lugar a dudas la mejor compra que pude haber hecho y más por el precio que fue alrededor de 9,000 mxn por la versión de 64 gb.Honestamente no se ocupan más gb si no piensas descargar películas, ya que actualmente tengo instalados alrededor de 25 juegos y aún tiene bastante espacio.Lo recomiendo ampliamente.

Soy una persona que crecio sin videojuegos y nunca tuve la curiosidad de comprar consolas. Un dia vi un video de Beat Saber y quise saber mas al respecto. El hecho de jugar en realidad virtual me parecio muy atractivo. Lamentablemente, en ese entonces, 2017, los visores de realidad virtual eran muy costosos y privativos a tener computadoras con tarjeta de video potente.Supe del Quest en enero 2020 y en cuanto supe que era una opcion portable, me decidi a comprarlo para probar Beat Saber. El precio me parecio elevado ($9000 en ese momento) pero aun asi decidi comprarlo. Aun con ese precio, es una oferta accesible, tras comparar con otros visores de realidad virtual. En muchas reseñas se critican los graficos del visor, pero sinceramente no experimente ningun detrimento en la calidad de los graficos ni afecta en la inmersion. La bateria del visor dura aproximadamente 2 horas. Unas baterias recargables para los controles duran una semana y media jugando entre 1.5 y 2 horas diarias.La mejor compra que he hecho en mucho tiempo. Vale cada centavo que he pagado.

I love the system.  It is fast, clear and flexible.Unfortunately one of my controllers died after less than a month (no physical damage) and Oculus support is slow to respond and requires up to 12 business days when they finally get around to sending me a shipping label (they are being evasive).  They are currently ""looking into this further"";  it is simply defective and they are being slow and evasive.  I suspect they are either short on parts or the support rep is being useless but required to respond with something to meet an SLA.  This is crap.  I want my product fixed and the support is useless.

I would give this a 5 star review - the games are fun, there's lots of them, and the 2 hour battery life is more than enough because you actually get tired playing. BUT you only get one account, one avatar, one user, per headset. This is beyond disappointing. If I play a bunch of levels and then my husband wants to play, he has to start the game where I left off. I played halfway through the Vader Immortal game, then all he could do is chapter select or watch from where I was. There is no way to add a second oculus account and there is no way to add a second avatar within an account. The only way you can save games separately is to make two oculus accounts, buy each game twice, and then factory reset the headset and reload the account every time you switch users.

Having used an HTC Vive, and a Rift 1, I can say I'm VERY happy with the Quest.  Biggest factor is convenience.  No sensors to set up, no software to install, convenience of purchasing Apps from the App store but NOT a walled garden (can side load Apps from elsewhere).  I use it in 4 rooms, and it remembers my guardians in each room.  Just put the headset on and go.The quality is not as high as a headset connected to a $4k gaming machine, but I don't really notice the difference, and you can connect to a gaming PC if you want.Things don't like.Face pad is rough on my skin (will likely buy an aftermarket pad).Very inconvenient watching media, with the volume on the headset, and needing to fumble for a controller to ff/rewind/pause.

Creo que es un excelente producto, se nota mucho la calidad de los materiales, diseño y hasta el empaque. Lamentablemente creo que por la crisis, desabasto, aumento del dolar, se ha hecho dificil conseguirlo al precio justo, y a veces la relacion costco-beneficio podria no ser tan buena dependiendo a cuanto lo consiguen.Para los que nunca han usado un headset de VR es una experiencia impresionante, desde los tutoriales hasta los videos que existen en la plataforma, son bastante inmersivos y es otro tipo de sensacion que no se compara con las consolas tradicionales. Los juegos podrian ser sencillos, no tan largos, ni demandantes graficamente, pero eso no le quita puntos por que estas consolas apenas estan empezando. Aun asi hay otros headsets (Valve Index) que pueden lograr este tipo de graficos, solamente que son de un costo mucho mayor y se requiere una computadora con ciertos requerimientos.Para los que estan pensando comprarlo y usar un cable USB C (Link) para jugar juegos de computadora, mejor hagan su investigacion y configuren Virtual Desktop, necesitan un modem que soporte la banda de 5GHz, y obviamente una computadora ""gamer"", pero van a tener menos problemas que usando el cable (aun esta en beta), aparte de que van a poder seguir jugando wireless. Otro punto importante es que si hacen eso, van a poder comprar juegos de Steam, que son mas baratos que en la tienda de Oculus.

Hands-down, the future of gaming. You don’t play games with this thing, you engage in experiences. The possibilities are unlimited. Keep in mind, graphically and functionally, this unit isn’t the best in any individual category, but is truly the best overall experience. And the price point is unheard of, compared to buying a next gen console on arrival. This is, what the NES did for home gaming. The tech and our ability to adapt it for VR experiences is still in its infancy. For any of its drawbacks, you keep that in mind. This is the absolute tip of the spear in what will be a revolution in how we play games, but more uniquely, how we will interact with virtual space for the next generation.Do yourself a favour and buy one. Then share it with your friends.Gamers will find it very intuitive, non-gamers will need someone familiar with VR to help them acclimatize to the control aspects.100% wireless.100% enjoyable.

I love my new Quest one of the only main disadvantages is lots of my previous apps off my gear VR are not compatible with the Quest and seems I'm expected to re purchase them for the Quest and their store is limited in what the Gear VR store had. They are so strick on what they allow in the store even with SideQuest its limited however the experience is way more quality and immersive. I haven't tried pc link or remote desktop due to having a outdated PC. This Headset is way more professional then the Gear VR.

You will find better quality VR gear but this one has no wires or towers - it makes room scale that much more immersive when you don't have to think about a tether. Oculus Quest feels like a VR gaming console mixed with a VR version of your Android smartphone. The dashboard is very fun and snappy to ""shoot at"" with the controllers. It's very immersive.Setup using the phone was quick and easy. I made an Oculus account and skipped linking it to Facebook because I don't use it. It also let me skip the credit card info which is good because I'm not ready to buy anything else just yet. Then the phone put the headset into update mode and it was done minutes later. The Quest came pre-loaded with quite a few demos to try which was nice. None of the games gave me motion sickness, but the joystick movement and buggy looking menu system in Rec Room eventually got to me. I had to take the headset off for a bit to settle the stomach before jumping back in.The only major con I have been experiencing is with the lenses, apparently the smudgey look in them is normal so I have accepted it as a first-gen limitation of the manufacturing process, it's not usually that noticeable but it's annoying when it is. The headset makes you see things as though they are further away so I had to use contact lenses as a near-sighted person. The headset has enough room for my small rectangle glasses as well but big round glasses don't fit. There is definitely a screen door effect but it's also not very noticeable while you are moving around gaming. Being able to watch TV in VR is very cool and useful but the visual experience is degraded because of the lenses and the screen door effect and in no way compares to regular TV quality. Making the VR TV enormous helps though and laying down and watching on the ceiling is crazy.Overall I have had a ton of fun and, despite its flaws, it feels well worth the price for entry VR. I wasn't sure if this would be a keep or a return since VR is still so early but I'm totally hooked now.

I used Windows mixed reality since 2018. However, the experience was ok as my set has no manual IPD thus the experience is not good as the software IPD cant meet the setting I need. Focus is always a challenge. My brother bought the Quest and I was shocked how good the visual was compared to my WMR set. Despite the lower resolution compare to the WMR, the manual IPD adjustment make a night and day difference to my experience. The WMR has reliability issue, I have the headset and controller replaced once during the warranty. I hope the Quest is more reliable. Other than that the Quest is front heavy which I have to use counter weight. The option to use it without wire is also a big plus. I am very impressed with the Quest and am anticipating the Quest 2 which should be even better. (update after 3 months) the right controller suddenly loss the haptic feedback. After taking all the suggested steps of Re-pairing, resetting quest to factory default, the motor still refuse to move. I thought oculus should do better than WMR as this is my 2nd experience of failed controller with VR.

I get really bad motion sickness and only found a few games that made me feel sick but most of them I didn't get motion sickness at all(beat sabre, Pistol whip, Star wars episode 1 and 2, National Geographic) Those games are awesome and can't wait to purchase more games!

The oculus quest is the best piece of hardware I ha e ever owned. Better than any console, better than my laptop. This thing sucks you into the digital world like you wouldn't believe. The immersion is insane. Screen door effect is almost unnoticable. In terms of detail and screen quality, this far surpasses the HTC vive. The one and only flaw I've noticed is that the nose area has a small amount of light leakage, but it is almost impossible to tell once you're in a game.

Overall I have no problems with the Oculus Quest except when I plug in the left ear bud, it seems to not work all the time, It will cut in and out, It is not the ear bud but the unit, If you press the plug and slightly push it forward it will work again, My brothers unit has the same issue. Other than that I highly recommend it to all.It can get pricey and they need to create more games. But its great...

I was hesitating between giving it 4 or 5 stars.Pros :- wireless- remembers barriers so you don't have to redo them constantly- double tap to see your surroundings is really nice- having 2 headphone plugs is really handyCons :- I start getting a headache after playing a while because it is really heavy- weirdly enough I find it hard to know which controller goes in which hand and I always mess up. They are kinda oddly shaped and they weight distribution isn't natural- To be able to play my steam games wirelessly I had to install so many programs and apps and pay 25$ for virtual desktop, kinda complicated for no reason... I know they want you to buy from their store but I had an HTC vive before and already had bought a bunch of games...

Then I have been playing a few games as well into the evening,  Its simply amazing walking around in game and feeling like I am really there....only to just be walking around in my living room.

When I visiting my son in May he had the older version with cameras on stands lots of set up and more.  I fell in love with VR, but not the setup. When he let me know they now had the Oculus Quest which was literally just a headset and hand controls that did the same thing, I purchased it immediately. Madly in love with the game called Beat Saber and have played it once or twice a day since buying this unit.  It's amazing. A few glitches occasionally but nothing important.

I spent a few months trying to decide whether to purchase the Oculus Rift S or the new Quest.  I was initially worried about the quality of the games, running on a mobile processor vs a full pc desktop with a powerful graphics card, but after watching reviews, and then discovering the possibility of being able to stream VR games from my gaming PC, I decided to bite the bullet and purchase the Quest.  A couple of things immediately won me over:1) No cables and 360 degree tracking.  This, in itself, is amazing and a game changer.  Once you try it, it’s really really hard to go back.2) The portability.  I travel a lot for work and I can take this thing with me anywhere.  That’s awesome.The game library is somewhat limited, but games are coming out all the time and there are quite a few great options in the store.  Beat Saber is fantastic, and there are a number of really fun and immersive games that will blow you away.If I have any complaints they would be the following:1) The unit is somewhat heavy sitting on your face.  It’s not too bad, but long sessions you may notice it.2) Battery life - I get about 2 hours right now, which is actually fine as I usually only play for about 30mins to an 1hr each evening so it’s enough for me, but may be a pain for those who like longer sessions (FYI - you can use a battery pack and mount it on the back for extra play time should you desire, there’s a couple guides on the net that explain how to do this).3) Audio.  It has these built in speakers that fire down towards your ears and, while it works quite well, you’ll probably want to get your one earphones to use instead.  A nice feature is that Oculus provide two external headphone jacks on either side of the headset, and they work great.  But it’s something to note.  Also, if you do use the built in ones, everyone will hear what you are playing.All in all I absolutely love this device and am thrilled with it.  I cannot wait to see where this technology goes, the possibilities are endless and I really believe this is the future of VR.

So I have a valve index which I thought would be the best of the best and I'm alot of cases, it is. But this headset is what I feel is the most innovative of all. Having full 6 degrees of freedom with PC quality games in an all-in-one headset is just astonishing. I was actually very skeptical of the inside out tracking but a buddy got this headset and the first time I tried it I knew this was a special product. Honestly people if you have never experienced vr before or have but want something to bring with and think this might just be a cheap rip off of vr, it's not.  The battery life does only last for just over 2 hours for me if Im playing a intensive game like super hot or espire 1 but with the included cable that can reach quite a distance, I was never far enough away from a receptacle that I had to worry about that. The resolution and oled screens made reading text super easy and made browsing and watching videos a pleasant experience. Big screen which is a movie theater simulated experience was awesome because you just lay in bed while being a movie theater. The tracking is near perfect. I never had an issue with aiming guns or interacting with stuff, it just works Everytime. The recently implemented hand tracking is pretty neat but it's only useful for menu navigation for now.  So coming from having a really good PC vr system, I'd say this experience is on par with that of the valve index due to not having to have a wire attached to you so you're free to go wherever you want and have true vr that's portable. With oclulus link now available, you can even use it as a pc vr headset if you have that or for later down the road too!! There's almost no reason to not pick this bad boy up as it'll be the center piece of parties or gatherings or just to have at breaks at work to get everyone to try out the wonderfulness that is virtual reality!

First of all, a lot of people complain about the headset being front heavy. Yes, it’s a little bit heavier than some other VR systems, but in no way does this limit gameplay. It also doesn’t hurt your face like some reviews would make you believe, you just need to get the straps right and you’ll be good.I previously owned the PSVR, and the Quest is definitely better. Having no wires makes games twice as immersive. As far as graphics go, the Quest isn’t the best on the market but you will not find anything this good for the price. After owning both types of systems I would recommended spending the extra 100 dollars for the Quest.The system is relatively new, so the store doesn’t have a huge selection. That being said they’re are plenty of great titles on it (Beat Saber, Pistol Whip, Superhot), there are games being added almost daily.All in all, great system. May not be perfect, but in this price range it is 100% your best option.

Since amazon is now blocking me from reviewing the Quest 2, consider this a review of both Quest 1 and 2.  I was very happy with the Quest 1 for the past year and thought I'd upgrade to the Quest 2.  I've had the Quest 2 for 5 days now and cannot use it due to the horrible decision Oculus has made to FORCE A FACEBOOK account to use the device otherwise its just a paperweight.  My newly created facebook account has been disabled and I cannot even get started with it.  Oculus support can do nothing about it.  They cannot support what they require.  They tell me to contact facebook.  Facebook does nothing to resolve the issue.  Keep in mind this can happen to you at any time and you can lose everything you've purchased.

Lo malo:Hay un hueco te tamaño considerable debajo del headset una vez que te lo pones, por lo que podrían causarse problemas en cuanto a la inmersión al VR se refiere, se puede corregir ingeniándoselas para cubrir el hueco, pero no debería ser así, el headset es pesado en comparación con otros del mercado, obligatoriamente tienes que usar el celular para configurarlo por primera vez y se actualizará sin siquiera consultarlo, la tienda de Oculus Quest no dispone de muchas aplicaciones y juegos que Steam VR si tiene debido al procesador y memoria del headset, por lo que sera necesario conectar el headset a una computadora gamer para poder utilizar Steam VR y otras apps de VR, los tutoriales y configuraciones pueden llegar a ser monotonas, la creacion de avatares es muy basica y no hay mucha variedad para crear un personaje, oficialmente no hay forma de utilizar Steam VR de manera inalámbrica ya que Oculus bloqueó esta opcion de una App de terceros, se desconoce si en un futuro se implementará dicha funcionalidad de manera oficial, la aberración cromática está presente en el headset de manera leve y hay que tener especial cuidado de donde se guarda despues de ser utilizado pues es bastante delicado al polvo, humedad y luz solar.Lo bueno:Headset completamente independiente una vez configurado desde el teléfono, libertad completa de exploración y desplazamiento al no contar con cables obligatorios, buen tracking de los controles y la funcionalidad de hand tracking para usar tus manos en lugar de los controles es sorprendente, cuenta con bocinas y microfono integrado de alta calidad lo que facilita la inmersión en VR de una manera fantástica, la funcionalidad de Oculus Link permite que el headset sea reconocido por medio de cable como un Oculus Rift y así poder jugar a cualquier aplicación o juego existente en tu PC, la conectividad del headset es muy buena y es muy personalizable a nivel software, buena calidad en materiales tanto del headset como de los controladores.

I have previously owned a Gear VR, Oculus Dk2 and CV1. I have also used a Vive. This has blown them all away.Touch controllers are in my opinion the best improvement to VR since the launch of the big consumer devices. The combination of these with a wireless complete mobile setup is revolutionary. I find myself playing this way more than I ever did with any other VR device.I got rid of my Oculus CV1 when I had a child because I didn’t have time to deal with a gaming pc, updates, cord + sensor management, etc. This has made VR gaming open for casuals.Be aware since the device only came out in May, at the time of this writing the top end game Library is small, but really all you need is beat Saber and Vader Immortal to keep you entertained for months.PS.

Hardware/Equipo: estéticamente es un buen producto, los materiales se perciben de buena calidad aunque algunos no son los correctos para su función, la banda de audio no esta bien ensamblada y la almohadilla absorbe el sudor, los trigers de los controles se sienten un poco frágiles y la resolución de pantalla no es lo mejor, duración de batería corta 2 hrs aprox.Software/Sistema: tiene algunos fallos frecuentes, a veces se congela, o no reconoce los controles, o falla el sistema de seguridad perimetral (guardian), a mi parecer se siente aún en desarrollo ( se han liberado actualizaciones).Catalogó de Juegos: aún limitado, han estado saliéndo nuevos (principalmente shooters), los juegos de rol son muy cortos, recomiendo descargar los que cuenten con juego en línea, los precios van de los $9 a los $34 USD la mayoría entre $19 y $30.Comodidad: de inicio es difícil lograr un buen enfoque, si lo ajustas demasiado puede doler la cabeza, algunos juegos te van a provocar nausea, te acostumbras  con el paso de los días, algunos juegos te harán sudar, en zonas cálidas mejor que cuentes con aire acondicionado como en mi caso mty.Resumen: Después de 6 semanas de uso no me arrepiento de la compra, algunos juegos son muy inmersivos y realistas, incluso algunos para ejercitarse, los gráficos no son muy pulidos pero aun así la experiencia es buena, además de juegos hay apps y canales para ver contenidos en VR, como sitios icónicos de ciudades del mundo o recorridos por las montañas, y algunas apps para conectar lap top y usar el visor para tener oficina virtual con monitores múltiples, buena opción si tienes buen espacio en casa ya que no es para uso exterior.

I do recommebd buying after market accessories to improve on the comfortably when wearing this unit. Some flaws with the design for me. I have purchased a silicone cover for the face foam. Makes wearing it for longer sessions more comfortable. So what are you waiting 4? Click the buy now button!

First I wanna add that I did have issues with my device but Amazon has amazing customer service and took care of me and now I have a replacement on the way.WOW, I used to say to people who asked me about VR before that I couldn't see monitor gaming being replaced but to be honest VR is its own thing that isn't meant as a replacement to flat gaming but it is meant as a way more immersive platform.I had a couple of moments where I was in the middle of a multiplayer match and I was just staring at things like my hands and gun thinking to myself how real it felt, how out of all the games I've been playing my entire life VR is the only one to do what I've been wanting to do since I first played games and that is actually be inside the game.If you are on the fence and can afford this pull the trigger because if your on the fence you will 100% not be disappointed what so ever.

Cordless VR is amazing, and apps like Virtual Desktop allow you to connect it like a PC-connected headset wirelessly as well. Good games such as Beat Saber, SUPERHOT VR and Tetris Effect, and sideloading games greatly enhances the library. Would recommend for a first look into VR, and for people with low performance PCs or no PC at all.

Works good. Nothing wrong with the software or the hardware. Needs more of a selection for games and apps. I found it difficult to find replacement lenses.

I had tried the Oculus Rift with my PC a while ago and was put off by the low resolution and screen door effect. I am used to gaming at 4K with life like graphics and so was expecting more improvement in the resolution, but its still not there yet. The Quest being fully wireless, and supporting 6 degrees of freedom is a great VR experience otherwise. The controllers are great too and its almost possible to believe you can use both hands in the VR world. But I just can't overlook the grainy visuals.

The absolute BEST VR for gaming on the market! Can be used All-in-one or wired to a gaming rig. Makes the Rift S obsolete! It's fun to use, easy to setup and good battery/storage. After a while though it can create aches on the front and back of you head as it's quite weighted ( because of the inner components) mandatory 45-1hr playtimes as it can be painful after a while.

This is a great VR set. Very easy to setup and get going. There are no wires to connect to a PC or a game console, but you need a smart phone. Comes with fun utilities, demos etc. that are just fun by themselves. The fit is not perfect, but that's not enough inconvenience to go down to 4 stars.

Not having a PC powerful enough to get into VR I thought I'd never be able to try it. But this VR headset being complete standalone changed everything. Some cons with this device is the low battery life and being extremely front heavy. You would not be comfortable wearing this for more than an hour without balancing it out with something on the back. Luckily there are solutions to this like adding a head-strap or attaching a power bank to the back to extend battery life and reduce the front pressure.

I was constantly waiting for a jumping on point for VR and this is exactly that. It gives a fully immersive VR experience despite any graphical sacrifices due to the 6DOF and Hand Presence. those two factors are WAY more important than graphics for immersion. 64GB is also way more than necessary right now. The only gripes I have are that there's no cloud saving yet and there are tiny spots of static that pop up randomly but they're jut annoyances at most.

Great product, only problem I have and not sure if possible, but could not transfer games purchased from rift to the quest (2 different models). Perhaps because the games may be modified to fit the quest, but I’m not sure. Wish a purchase on your account would allow access to games on either device.
