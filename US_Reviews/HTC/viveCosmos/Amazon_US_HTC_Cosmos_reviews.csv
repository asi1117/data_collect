Do not buy this product. Please, for your own sake, DON'T. They must require you to use their ""Viveport"" software in order to basically get the drivers. Viveport is the single worst piece of software I have ever experienced, by far. Couldn't tell you how the actual item works, I've spent over a week just attempting to get the software to do anything, and I still haven't gotten so much as a flicker out of the headset. I can't even describe how horrible Viveport software is.I haven't given up yet due to the money already wasted here, figure I'll end up begging Amazon for a refund before its through. For the record, I will not be updating this review, even if it does decide to work, after the amount of trouble I've already had out of this... I don't care how good or bad it is, it wasn't worth the hassle.So PLEASE, for your own sake, buy something else.Update: 15 days after receiving, the software for this paper weight still doesn't work. Customer support answer? Reformat your computer form this software to function. Really? This ""items"" only works with a new, unused install of Windows10? Where is that in the description? Where is the disclaimer ""you will have to erase your computer to install this device"".

As an Oculus and Windows Mixed Reality user, I was definitely expecting a difference with this system. And I was right. Been using this for about a week consistently with a Ryzen 7 2700 and RTX 2070 Super, and here's what I found:First, the pros:- Modularity (can swap to original cosmos and other models).- Upgrade to Index or its parts down the line, if you so wish.- Beautiful and almost crystal clear display.- Looks fantastic and very good build quality.- Tried and true SteamVR tracking and higher refresh rate (90Hz), making for a buttery smooth and precisely tracked VR experience.- Very comfortable headset. Almost on par with the Rift S.Now for the cons:- Very VERY small sweet spot. Took me about half an hour of adjusting to get that crystal clear image.- The included Vive controllers. Didn't use them before, but I'm not a big fan. The button placement and trackpads made some in-game features an annoyance. Reminds me too much of the WMR controllers.- Headset bobbing (if that makes sense). May just be a software bug and only ran into it one day, but when I fired up Pistol Whip and Beat Saber the game itself moved with the headset when looking around the room despite tracking smoothly. This issue was not only a nuisance for me but was also very nauseating. I did have high settings when recording with OBS so the issue may have just been a bottleneck.Overall, while it is very hard to justify the $900 price point, I'm actually pretty impressed by the Vive Cosmos Elite, especially given the mixed reviews of the original Cosmos. It may not fully compete with the Valve Index, but it's not far behind either. If you can get past the controllers and sweet spot issue, you're looking at a very decent experience. Plus, if you still want to upgrade to the Index down the line, you have the freedom to do so.

So i bought this back in April of 2020, 970 bucks new. It worked fine. Had to have a base station replaced. Which was hassle free. Now i just upgraded my pc with an rtx 3080 gpu, had several problems with tracking, and grey outs. I messaged vive about the issues. Turns out the drivers aren't compatible with the new 30 series cards. That's fine, so long as there is going to be an update to the software. But support just kept telling me to buy another gpu. One That's on the supported list. Basically told me to spend more money to downgrade to fit their product. They wouldn't say that there would be any software upgrades. They just told me buy another gpu. That works for their product. So if you plan to buy a 30 series or AMD variant gpu, be aware that HTC will not acknowledge it. They will tell you to buy a gpu thatcis already on their list. Instead, buy a reverb, or index. Now I'm stuck with a 970 dollar brick you wear on your head, that is absolutely useless. A thousand dollars pretty much just stolen from me not even 6 months in.

For their latest and greatest headset, its literally all old hardware. Here are all the issues and complaints I have:1. The controllers that come with this are 1.0, IE not compatible with 2.0 base stations. This one really pisses me off honestly cause I just bought 2.0 base stations cause I am moving everything out to my living room, just to find that they are not compatible.2. The sound quality from the headphones is very tin can like and completely out shined by the valve index.3. I also had to literally zip tie the headphones down cause they kept snapping up.4. My playspace keeps going slanted, though this is fixable with some extra work and a whole lot of googling, my point is I shouldn't of had to do this to begin with.5. They seriously need to redesign their controllers, they are huge uncomfortable and clumsy and are literally only good for beat saber.6. Headset feels too loose even when tightened down.Ok all that being said I do have some pro's to say:1. Once I figured out how to properly position the headset I would say it is the most comfortable headset I have had.2. I really like the rubber padding that they have as I am typically doing physically active things that make me sweat, so the rubber doesn't soak it up and get gross. I can quickly wipe it down and move on. Even being rubber it is still really comfy to me.3. The picture quality is comparable to the valve index.4. You can go wireless, which is ultimately what is preventing me from returning it.

So the htc vive cosmos elite. You are probably like me when I was buying this headset and wondering why would I buy this head if I can get a valve index for only $100 more?  Well for one the whole point with the cosmos is customization. The way how the head set was built was for multiple attachments to be on it and face plates that can feel like your on a whole new head set. What I mean and what I think vibe is trying to do is make something you will never need to change out but instead just spend like $200 for a new face plate and boom it’s like you just bought a new head set. Plus let’s not forget this headset has a better refresh rate , better shipping , and it can be wireless all unlike the valve index.So in short words I would recommend getting this headset because it could save you money farther down the future.If you are switching from an oculus headset or a mixed reality head set I guarantee you will have a whole new experience. Now also this depends on your pc but that’s for every head set now.So there you have it that’s my honest opinion on theHTC VIVE COSMOS ELITE

I've had this a while and love it. But it's not for everyone, I'm gonna simply list PROs/ConsPros:Easy to set upAvailabilityComfortablePicture qualityDecent refreshVery little screen doorModular!!!Flip up visorHAS EVERYTHING FOR BASIC CONFIGURATIONCONS:Price price price1.0 lighthousesVive wandsSmall sweetspot(more on this)HeadphonesFlip up visorRant/reviewPicked this up as it was available and I've been dying to get into the VR space.The picture is great, however the sweetspot is hard to find and is very very small. Few things I've done to improve this was swap lenses, and change forehead pad to a slightly thinner one (I made it myself as no aftermarket is available)Prior to mods, flipping up.visor caused me to lose my sweetspot and having longer hair the HMD wanted to fall off my head.The headphones that came with the HMD are of decent audio quality, but I personally found them uncomfortable, and never sat quite right on my ears, so i removed them and flipped the cable guide tucked in the rear padding to reroute the cable so it wasnt catching my ear. I use a Corsaie Void Pro headset and compliments the HMD well, and helps maintain position of HMD as well as sweetspot.The light houses are 1.0, they work for me but if you use a LARGE room scale play area, you'll need to upgrade. I havent hit the limitations of the 1.0s personally yet.The wants, are kind of eh.. the batteries last about 4 hours, and they never die at the same time. They get to be awkward and uncomfortable in some games and feel somewhat limited vs. Other options available.However it has EVERYTHING you need to hop up and get started. Imho not worth $800 but I'm satisfied with my purchase.

The wands and base stations work but not the headset. When I plugged in the headset the red light on the left side lights up indicating that it is getting power and the base stations recognized it during room setup but when I put the headset on in order to ""wake it up"" the headset just displays a blank/black screen the same as if it were completely unplugged. I am not sure what the buton on the left of the headset next to the red light is but if it is the power button then the headset is broken. Please either provide me with reasonable tech support or a new headset and I will change this to 5 stars.

I'm rather surprised this worked on my system. My gaming PC is an MSI GL63-series laptop with a Geforce 1660 TI Mobile graphics card. Not exactly the Lambo of gaming laptops or graphics, but it handles well enough for every game I've put it up against.All the 'DisplayPort needed' talk made me wiggle too, but an MDP-to-DP adapter make it work perfectly. (Heck, it came with one in the packaging, too)Pros:So far, games work just fine on mediumish quality with little to no lag issues. I play Half Life: Alyx on Medium and it works very well, Beat Sabre give no trouble, and VRchat also operated quite well. The room-tracking actually impressed me, it was quite near 1:1 movement with maybe 2-15 ms delay at worst and that was because of the laptop most likely. It presented an appropriate sense of scale within applications, as well as ample crouch detection, which you need for some games behind cover!The button configuration works well enough for all apps since SteamVR is handling most of the input mappings to known VR systems I suppose. Sure, it doesn't have a hand strap like the Index... so I use the wrist straps and don't drop my controllers. I don't hand per-finger tracking, but I got grips, and the interfaces are fine with that. Sure, I popped extra for the room sensors, it made logical sense so my clumsy self won't bump into the TV or  couch.Cons:The cable can bunch up a bit after a few dozen turns around the room, I'll attest to that. Sort of wish the earphones would better press to my ears, but I can hear through them fine while they hover just a half-inch away from my ears. Wouldn't've minded a 3.5mm plug to auxiliary headphones. Mic works in VRchat clearly however.Maybe this is just me still finding my VR legs, but after a few hours of usage, I do notice a 'tactile disparity' with the real world the next day. It's gotten better, probably need to tune that side eye-spacing knob a little better. But that knob ain't great and I can't go below 60mm which might help some smaller folk.Sure I had to make a Vive account during setup but... at least it ain't hocking my personal information or locking my games to a Meta account like some VR solutions might be doing. I don't HAVE to use the Vive storefront; SteamVR interfaces with it just fine. In fact, it's what does the actual room setup.Summary:I mean, sure the Index would be baller, but some of us have more important things like... you know... rent or groceries or bills. Do you NEED a $1,000+ VR setup? ... I mean REALLY NEED it? Do you need a $1,000+ phone? I mean REALLY NEED it? Do you NEED a car with power windows or can you just use the hand crank to achieve the same outcome and save a couple hundred bucks?Moderation in all things; the middle option is oftentimes sufficient. The HTC Cosmos Elite is plenty sufficient for its intended use case scenarios.

So for anyone looking to get into VR, this doesn't seem like a bad investment until it actually arives and you use it for a period of time longer than 2 hours.the TL;DR of this is, headset design sucks, ipd wheel problems, resolution isn't as good as stated. Vive wands are great and seem like solid hardware. Base station 1.0 are decent with enough light but will still have some blind spots, upgrading to 3-4 base station 2.0 will solve any and all tracking issues.To start off, this headset is plagued by a faulty IPD wheel which happens on atleast enough of the headsets that there's a RMA for it and multiple posts across reddit and the like. This faulty IPD wheel (that uses tiny plastic gears that break over time) will cause a anoying and large screen to pop up showing you the calibration for the IPD which will destroy your ability to see anything in game. Playing beat saber when this happens will induce a rage akin to someone having murdered your dog.The build quality and design of the headset is also rather...childish. In HTC's infinite wisdom they wanted to have a flip up design, the issue is now the weight of the front headset rests on a hinge that is attached to a crown. This weight is pulled down your face due to it's design whereas the index or occulus, for example, use both a top strap and side straps to secure the weight to your head allowing far less movement of the HMD (headset display) This normally doesn't seem like a problem until you realize that getting the headset to sit 'correctly' on your head is a mini-game everytime you put it on. I slap my index on and it just works everytime. My old rift was the same way. I'm unaware of any benefit the Cosmos's design has over these headsets other than being able to flip it up (which ironically, because of the weight, causes the headset to shift on your head, meaning you have to adjust it again)Controllers are solid, like really solid. I don't feel like I would break them whereas the index controllers, while functionally better than anything currently available, are made out of cheep plastic and feel like junk.The base station 1.0 will serve every single purpose until you wish to get into full body tracking. With ample light and correct placement you should be able to do feet, waist, hands and headset tracking with the 1.0's and not incure any issues. If your wallet and curiosity will one day make you want to do more than just that level of tracking you will need base station 2.0's. Why? Wider feild of view on the stations, ability to have 4 stations aimed at your play space, literally zero syncing issues due to line of sight, and I want to say less latency but I'm probably biased on that. Honestly if your gonna go full body tracking (because you have the money) just get the Vive Pro Eye or a Valve Index.In the end, your probably better off spending the extra 100$ to get the Index. If you take care of the controllers (make sure your plays pace is clear and be cognizant of your surroundings. You should have no issues. Valve has a no questions asked (mostly) and very nice RMA policy on their equipment. Good luck getting anything fixed through HTC. There is a reason why their nickname is ""Hates the Customer""Best of luck in your VR journey!

I bought this as an ""upgrade"" to my original vive with the deluxe audio strap.The resolution increase is very noticeable, and makes everything look amazing! However, the ""halo"" this uses to allow the headset to be flipped up makes any games requiring movement completely unplayable!The headset is supported solely by a hinge on its top. So it will bounce up and down as you move. The halo also slides from side to side if you turn your head slightly.Because the hinge does not allow you to keep the bottom of the headset pressed against your face, there is a huge gap by your nose. The nose rest was 2-3 inches away from my face, letting me see out of the bottom way more than on other VR headsets.I really wanted to like this, but the flip-up display completely ruins the immersion. I returned this a week after getting it even though, I already gave my girlfriend my old vive. I plan on buying the older vive or vive pro to replace this.I am extremely disappointed in HTC for allowing such a flawed device to be their new face of VR.

Overall just a bad experience. I've used several headsets and none this expensive were so poorly thought out.First off the lenses are some of the worst I've seen in a headset so far leading to a very small sweet spot and pretty extreme blurring about halfway across the radius of the lens to the edges meaning you have to point your head at everything to see it clearly. Not like our eyes can turn, right? This is compounded by the complete lack of a lens-to-eye distance mechanism besides removing the foam padding and exposing your face to velcro hooks.All of this was on top of the face that the software constantly updated to the same version over and over, controllers couldn't be tracked accurately for more than 30 seconds at a time and the right display in my set flickered about every 3 seconds.Rambling on, between the Index, Rift/Quest and the Vive, the controllers are the worst. They aren't nearly as ergonomic and lack a considerable number of basic features like two triggers, face buttons and joysticks. The touchpads are a chore to use and the hand presence (finger position recognition) falls short of what Oculus and Valve offer. Luckily the headset can be used with other controllers, but that's another big purchase.As much as Facebook is evil and requiring an account for an Oculus meas I will never buy another headset from them, if you don't have a problem with that, get a headset from them. Objectively better in every way except display resolution, which wasn't even that great in this headset.

My link box died after 13 months.  The warranty is 12 months.

They are out of stock everywhere, as if maybe everyone's poorly made converter boxes are dying.  Save your self some money and buy an Oculus Quest 2.

First off I want to say that VR is in its infancy stage. This system IS rated as a top of the line VR system. I initially bit the $ bullet and acquired this system primarily to enjoy the experience of flying in WW2 air combat. When you play with a flat screen (not VR) you see this nice clear resolution. When you wear VR goggles the image you see through your eyes IS NOT the same clarity you see on a flat screen. It is relatively clear but there is an underlying fuzziness in a VR image. So if possible you should try a good VR system first to decide if you can put up with this relative fuzziness before you layout all the bucks. Also be aware when it comes to good VR games available some games can only be played on specific systems. For example I can not play Stormland or Lone Echo on my system because these games were developed to only be played on specific VR systems. So (1) it will be 5 years plus to get the same resolution on VR that you will get on flat screen AND (2) VR game development technology is not standardized to enable to play any game on any VR system.

I have had nothing but problems with this set.  I'm a Twitch VR streamer and I spend more time trying to get the headset to work than I do actually using the headset.  I'm constantly getting the grey screen.  My HMD had to go through the RMA process within a month of purchasing it.  HTC sent me a new headset.  It worked fine a few times, after spending a considerable amount of time trying to get the tech to work.  However, it goes right back to a constant grey screen after one or two times of using it.This is easily the worst VR system I've used.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  Avoid completely.

After some initial setup and learning how to fit them to your head you will absolutely be having fun providing you aren't one of the poor souls who get sick. I am not, and hence have discovered somethiing that lets me work out, game and socialize every single day. My cardiovascular capacity is the best its ever been and I lost 10 pounds in about 3 months, already being fairly lean. The base stations (1.0) are very accurate and though I recommend good earbuds that stay in, the audio is suitable on the device. I will say the Vive wands are not good compared to the index controllers and getting Valve Index controllers should be a top priority, but you'll have fun with the wands for the time being. Get games that really explore the medium: Thrill of the Fight, Jet Island, Rec Room, Iron Wolf, Gorilla Tag and many more will challenge your fitness, skill and wits and if you have friends with systems the social experience is completely unparalleled, I had kind of given up on gaming...now I feel young again. i've tried the Vivepro and the Index and i'd say this is the best deal for a PC run system, and you don't have to sell your soul to Facebook. If you have the rig, i'd say any of the 3 are great but I have been partial to the Cosmos Elite system.

The VR headset is nice, found out you only need 2 base stations for things like VR chat and Beat Saber since the horrible software says 3 base stations is too many, and let's not even talk about 4 base stations. God forbid 4 come together into existence.And yes 3 trackers is max too for VRchat, and yes you can pair even 5 trackers with the viveport software but it won't look soo pleasing in the game (VRchat) and you also need a USB port for each Vive Tracker, I bought the 2018 model Trackers that work great. I know people know this already but some don't for some reason (VIVE TRACKER is NOT INCLUDED, SOLD SEPERATELY).I agree with the comments, Viveport software is @$z. It has to restart every time a device is updated, and after you pair all devices you might find yourself restarting Viveport and VIVE Console with it, some times I'd have it exit to end program background task and it would restart on its own when I just wait for task to end. Yes its annoying but once you can get it to start and pair all devices with ought needing to update anything its fine.Don't like that the controllers use an internal power bank, because I can't just swap batteries to keep going, hopefully you get tired before the batteries die. some people might even buy another pair of controllers but at that point you might have a VR addiction specially if you just want VR so you can stand in front of a mirror all day making small talk. yes I'm looking at you VRchat gamers.For those asking the small questions - - -how many power sockets do I need? only 3. How many or what ports do I need for the headset? Its a DP port and a USB 3.0 that you'll need. The base stations use a power cord and are wireless during use. But to charge controllers and each tracker you need a USB port for each controller and Vive tracker, more specifically standard Micro USB, the ones that looks like a mini capital D shape.How fast do these charge? - - -The controllers maybe took 15 minutes out of the box, might take 20 minutes at empty but they last about 5 or 6 hours more than enough time. specs online say 4-8 hours and I can understand why since you have that hectic feedback that might waste power power over time for games like Beat Saber so I think it be best to turn off vibration.Everything so far is great, the software is what sucks but you can get over it, unless you're technologically challenged then I can see people ready to murder support if they have to. I can't say I'm mad since I'm not phased by the challenge but I am disappointed for something this expensive with poor software support.Base station issues? - - -Not all base stations arrive noisy, if it does it might be a bad one so maybe contact support for that to get it replaced.I hope one day when I get online that the software is patched or at least polished twice for god sake, the setup/update phase was a nightmare to play one game. (for initial users) after the updates you don't have to restart the software as much. just remember to plug in your wireless USB adapters for each Vive tracker or you'll find yourself restarting both VivePort and VIVE Console.

I picked up this and the Valve Index, the Index does have it beat on field of view, but the Vive's display is noticeably better in color and clarity .  The Vive controllers have amazing tracking, but they're heavy and starting to show their age and there is no comparison between them and the Index's controllers (you can use those on the Vive too). But honestly my only major issue is that it's stupid front heavy and your neck will be hurting after a few minutes of play. If you are younger or don't have ripped neck muscles like a body builder, you may want to look at the much lighter Mixed Reality or Oculus headsets.

I used this for like 3 months just past being able to return it and then it stopped working. First the earphones stopped functioning for no reason then the headset crapped out altogether, so I'm out 600 bucks for cheaply made crap that doesn't work. Nothing I do and no trouble shooting of any kind does anything. Stay away and buy a different product form a company that isn't a rip off.

When I first got this, it worked fine. The headset is quite uncomfortable, and the only time I can seem to get anything in focus is when it is so tight on my face that it hurts. Even then, only the very center of the image is in focus, and anything outside of that is painful to look at. Once I got used to not moving my eyes, it worked fine for short play sessions, but anything longer than an hour would give me a headache and leave a mark on my forehead due to how tight I had to wear it.But then one day, it just stopped working. The video became extremely choppy, and there seems to be a delay between the different eye displays. I've gone through all of the troubleshooting steps, and nothing has helped. I reported this to HTC, but have yet to hear back. If they can fix it, I will change this review, but otherwise I basically spent over $800 on a paperweight.

At the time of the review the price for this is 899 USD. I however bought mine ""Used - Like New - In Original Box"" for 699 USD. Overall I am actually happy with it. I run all my games through SteamVR, although Viveport is an option. Viveport, by default, will start with Windows but this can be changed in the settings.I did have one issue, when I first got the headset it would not properly connect to steamVR and I would get no image. This was fixed by completely resetting the headset from Vive Console.There is no getting away from the fact however that the hardware is aging and HTC does not seem to care about adding features to this headset since it is considered ""experimental"".Refresh is fine at 90hz. However the Quest 2, Valve Index, and Vive Pro 2 all have it beat. If your computer can handle the frames these would be better for FPS. FOV(139° diagonal) is fine, better than Quest 2 but worse than Vive Pro 2 or the Valve Index.Controllers are outdated, better VR controllers have been developed since the Vive Wands came out. The ones that come with the Cosmos Elite are the same gen 1 controllers that came with the original HTC Vive(2016) The touch pads are fine in a most situations but a dedicated joystick and buttons generally would be better.The screen resolution is fine, I don't really notice the resolution unless I try to watch videos in the headset. Videos on my 1080p monitor look better than they do in VR.The only feature I wish worked was passthrough. From what I have read, while there are cameras on the headset, they do really function. They probably could function with a software update but it does not appear that HTC will put in the effort to fix them.Overall the headset it just fine. It works pretty well for what it is but if you are looking to spend 899 USD for the headset, keep in mind that the Valve Index is $999 USD and comes with newer controllers and newer base stations. I bought mine for 200 USD under MSRP and I am happy with the headset.

I bought this ""New"" as a gift to myself instead of buying a friend's used one. I should have bought the used one, since this one is obviously not new and I paid full price for it. I'm not even sure it's going to work as the HDMI is bent. The seal stickers weren't adheared to the box when I opened it and the plastic film wasn't attached to the base stations.Aside from the USED item being shipped to me, the HTC Cosmos is very high quality.

It's incredible to me that not all that many people are talking about this irk, but the hinge has to be the worst idea to ever come out of a companies boardrooms, let alone ship on a machine. The terrible flimsy hinge only barely locks down into place, so the facemask, no matter how I position the headset, the facemask pushes against my face and breaks the seal with the lenses, so the second you turn your head, it creates a slight gap that completely distorts the lenses and makes the headset unusable. no amount of ocular adjusting fixed this, and when I finally found a spot where it wasn't entirely blurry, I slightly turned my head and ruined it.PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS TECHNOLOGY, DO NOT BUY THIS HEADSET.

So, I am giving this 2 stars based on many factors.  I have another system that I use and so when I got this, I did so based on other reviews I read prior to buying it.  Firstly the set up in order to use this system is heartbreaking.  you have to set up sensors in order for the system to know where your headset and hand controllers are.  As I said, I have another VR set that does not require extra parts to know where everything is.  It already recognizes where the headset and controllers are.  Next, this headset is heavy.  Its well padded but the weight is a definite negative feature. The sensors also need to either be mounted on your wall requiring you to screw or maybe glue it to the wall OR you have to buy separately sold tripod stands to mount them on which I did because I can't screw things into a wall I don't own.  Next issue is that you are hard wired to a computer.  They may have a remote device that I am unaware of but it does not come with the system if they have it meaning something else you would have to buy separately.  Again, my other system can be played remotely or hard wired with no additional purchases necessary. The had controls are large and probably really good for large hand people but not so much for smaller statured folks like me.  I am sorry to say I would not recommend this product, as I am struggling to find a positive feature.

Rip-off. Offers no upgrade from original VIVE excluding resolution increase and built in audio. Horrible tracking. They don’t even include a direct-sync cable. Non of the built in cameras work yet, which to me seems like false advertising.I could go on and on, I got this because there were NO other VR headsets available but sadly I cannot  recommend this at all because in every game my head and arms would constantly displace.

Having used this rig for a few months now, I have to say the mechanical headphone design is pretty darn awful.It is a spring loaded 'clip down' design in which the ear pieces rest away from your head (ears) and then you are supposed to press them against your ears after which they should 'clip' into place and remain pressed against your ears.It. doesn't. work.At least, not for me. Perhaps being a 6'4"" adult factors in to the equation? Maybe it works better for small petite folks? Dunno.Anyhow, when I press the toads, er...,  I mean ear pieces against my ear, they pretty much always spring right back out again. Sometimes I can get them to stay in place, but this requires me to remain absolutely motionless, which is great for all those 'playing possum' games, but kinda awful for anything else.Their support was equally awful. Spent an hour trying to figure out if there was a workaround, or even a paid upgrade - but after being asked if I had tried adjusting a non-existent screw, I realized I had been pranked. 10/10 for that HTC, well done.Final conclusion: Remove and burn the factory headphones. Use a third party set. Stop being frustrated at such expensive gear sucking like this and buy something else when these EOL.I left two stars because the rest works ok.

This headset is unfortunately not worth it. In my opinion, the headset is uncomfortable. The ear phones don't even cusp your ears. Getting a sweet spot is impossible because once you find it, the headset moves a little and it's gone. It's consistently blurry and hard to see. The controls are atrocious, they're bulky and don't feel right. I know you can remedy a lot of these issues with upgrades or mods, however if your paying this much you shouldn't have to pay extra.  Assuming your willing to pay the extra, you might as well pay for a superior headset instead. This would be a nice entry to VR if it was more than half off its price.

This is my first VR set (that I’ve bought anyway). The visuals are really good. Very little blurring on the edges. I have found you have to adjust the headset to find the “sweet spot” where it’s all clear.When I first setup the base stations I was ready to throw this thing out a window. Tracking would not work. Period. After a lot of frustration, I realized that my Xbox connect emits an IR signal that completely interrupts the hive tracking. After turning off the connect, everything worked well.My only complaint is the VIVE port application which currently is bugged and you can’t even walk through it. Which is a shame cause it looks cool.I think VR has come a long way. Still some ways to go, but it’s definitely the future.

For the price, I think the headset is simply okay. I do love the headphones and the flip up display, but nothing else really makes it stand out. The actual display itself is super high resolution, they aren't lying when they say the screen-door effect is virtually gone. Additionally, I feel like it heats up less than the original Vive.I did have an issue with a dead pixel in the peripheral. Although minor, I emailed customer support and rather than the typical one email per day, it was solved that day within five emails. They offered to fix it for free, and even paid for shipping. I was told that it would take a month, but I ended up with a new headset the next week.

The reason this headset appeals to many people apposed to the ""Better"" Valve index is simply because the Index IS NOT MODULAR.if you ever want a Valve index 2, you will need to puchas another  $1,000+ headset.With the Cosmos you can buy new upgrades as planned in the coming future to stay up to date and customize the headset how you see fit.Instead of a new headset,  you can purchase the $200 upgrade,  or the wirless adapter allowing you to be in a separate room than the host computer.

Definitely just paid FULL price for a previously opened product. The order was for a ""Brand New"" headset, but this one had definitely been handled by someone before. The outermost packaging (basically just a sleeve) was mostly ""sealed"", but fudged enough to where someone could slide out the inner box. That box's seal sticker was completely split. After opening the box, the cables were haphazardly tossed in the top of the box, the plastic bags containing mounting supplies for the base stations were ripped open, and the stickers covering the outer cameras of the headset were already removed and completely absent. The controllers also failed to connect immediately (setup claims they'll connect first try), so we had to go in and manually set them up, leading me to believe they'd been paired before.The headset itself is amazing, controls great so far, and is comfortable. Definitely would recommend the product itself, but maybe purchase somewhere else if you want the full experience of opening what you just shelled almost $900 for.

So, as a first tried it on it was a pain to set my head with the ""sweet spot"" and any little small adjustment off from it resulted in God rays and blurred letters.Solution: I found small business products that used 3d printing molds of the HTC Vive Cosmos Elite and used the samsung vr lens.

Everything about this headset is amazing. Tracking, quality, and overall sturdiness of the headset is A+I have a couple of small 1st world problems with it thoughI wear glasses, sometimes the ear pieces and thr band of the headset will settle a bit too low when moving my head around to much and start digging my glasses into the side of my headThe flip up headset is really convenient but sometimes it's hard to put the headset back down because of my glasses. And it seems like the vision of the headset is blurred because your eyes are too far away due to this feature.Other than those small problems I think it's amazing, I would say get the valve index (if its ever in stock) if you have glasses instead. The only real thing that I would say this headset is a step ahead of the index is the fact that it has a wireless adapter for it. But keep in mind that the wireless adapter is about $350+.

I will have to see how it holds up in the long run but so far it has been absolutely great. So much so that I was actually confused why people hate so much on the vive in the first place. If you were thinking of getting an index anyways, I recommend just getting this for right now. The index isnt really available and you can easily upgrade by just buying knuckles and a headset in the future since this includes base stations. To me it is very much worth the price, I may even cancel my order of knuckles because I have loked the wands more than I thought I would.

Did not work. Me and my husband got this headset thinking we could use it on our pc, unfortunately set up was a 3 hour set up almost cause every other step it would fail or just do nothing eventually we got it to run and it over heated our pc to the point it was almost fried from roblox literally nothing hard to run or so I thought definitely not worth it.

Set up was super simple thanks to the tutorial that shows when installing vive. Everything was great until I put on the headset. The wire that was connected to the vive was loose. The display would black in and out unless you held it in while u played.

I had this for 10 days and ran into a lot of problems.However, I'll start with the pros:Screens were good and clearHeadset was mostly comfortableKit came with everything you need to get started, you don't have to buy anything else except a decent PCLighthouse trackers work very wellAudio and microphone quality was goodStayed pretty cool even after gaming for hoursAnd that's it for pros, I actually had an enjoyable experience for a bit, but I ran into a lot of issues.The cable came kinked. When I pulled it out of the box it was kinked and it felt extremely cheap, felt like a cable I would have found in the 90s, almost tacky and not really secure. I paid almost a thousand bucks after tax I'd hope the cable was at least acceptable, but that's not a huge deal.Came with lighthouse 1.0 bases and controllers from 2016. I got to try the 2.0s and Steam Index controllers, but they take 8 weeks to arrive and I really tried to like what I got with these, but I couldn't, they are massive clunky and not as accurate or comfortable as the index controllers, or even Rift S controllers.Takes time and practice to get the headset comfortable and the screens lined up nicely. It doesn't fit on my head like I feel like it should. The Index and Rift I can just put on and immediately the screens line up and it feels right, this one I had to spend several minutes the first time to get a clear image. After putting it on 40 or so times I got it figured out, but trying my friend's Index it was immediately perfect, without him giving me any instructions.The price. If this was $600-$700 it might be worth it. I'd understand the lighthouse 1.0 and awkward wands, and a few more compromises, but $900 bucks with very few advantages. The only time it felt right is when I was returning it.The nail in the coffin was a loose IPD (interpupillary distance). Whenever I moved too much in game or jumped or sometimes no reason at all the IPD would shift and bring up the IPD menu in my game. I contacted HTC about it hoping I was just missing something or they would do something to resolve it thanks to their ""Quality Assurance"" that came with the device. They said all they could do was take a look and replace the device if necessary and minimum lead time was three weeks. Three weeks on my brand new device, that delivered in two days and I got to use for nine.I ended up returning it. I didn't want to deal with the problems in the future, it was more than I ever paid for a device and I feel like it should have had some more quality. If these are issues you feel like you can deal with, I'd say go for it. It was very fun while it worked and I hope to get a new VR headset, but I won't be getting anything from HTC unless they seriously upgrade the quality.

Hot garbage.  Display looks OK.  Field of view is bad.  Always staring at big, black semi-circles on the bottom. Very front heavy so it flops around on the headband.  Flip it up to check something out while playing and you have to readjust it for 5 minutes to get the picture kind of clear.  Even the straps on the controllers won't stay cinched up.  Before you know it they are floppin' around like the headset is on the headband.  The headphones are supposed to clamp down on your ears like on the Oculus CV1 but they don't .  They stay in the popped up position unless you cram something in the hinge to wedge them down.  I now just use earbuds.  I sold my Oculus to ""upgrade"" to this. Now I have dropped %250 more than an Oculus Quest 2 and $100 less than a Valve Index for a headset that disappoints me so greatly I don't even play VR near as much as when I had my Oculus.I ended up purchasing this from Wal-Mart because when I wanted to purchase it Amazon had extremely delayed shipping.

I bought the vive cosmos on release day and left a review of that over a year ago. I'm leaving a review here because apparently Vive wasnt done with me.I was charged $12.99 2 days ago on my paypal account. When I contacted vive they stated I was an infinity member and that my 1 free year of infinity use was over and I was now going to be charged $13 a month.Some Background: I ordered a vive cosmos and recieved it on release day. I had issue after issue and boxed it back up for return ""THE DAY AFTER RELEASE DAY"". The only part of the entire process I was ok with was the customer support. I did an online chat with them. It took 5 minutes. They apoligized that the headset wasnt working, issued me a tracking sticker and said I'd get a refund as soon as the headset arrived. I then specifically asked ""Do I have to do anything else or are we now done?"", The customer service representative said ""Once we recieve your headset you are all set"".Fast forward 1 year and 1 day. HTC Vive states I've been an infirinty member for a year and charges me for a monthly fee. They can clearly see I never used it or even logged into the membership (because why would I since I dont have a VR Headset), but they refuse to back down. 10 emails later I finally beg 1 customer service representative to at the very least cancel the subscription.Heres the thing. I understand its only $13, but theres rampant unemployment spreading across the country right now and a pandemic. This company knows I never used the service. This company knows I dont even own one of their headsets and still they want their pound of flesh, because of a loop hole they left open when they processed my return.I bought the original HTC Vive and tossed it away after a couple years. Still I bought the next generation Vive hoping they worked out the bugs. I admired the company, I would have tried generation 3, but I wouldnt trust them with my personal information again.It is only $13. Still bothers me that they forcibly took it from me for a service never used and that should have been deleted when I spoke to customer service a year ago.

Works great.  Higher res than Index and the 90fps refresh rate is just dandy by me, especially considering my difficulty driving max FPS in many games even with a very beefy PC.Small (fixable) comfort issues.  There is definitely a ""break-in"" period; at first I got hot spots and thought it'd make me go bald.  After breakin, things improved.  Finally, I added a velcro strap by StudioForm Creative VR to distribute the weight more evenly; this made things very comfy.  I have also removed the nose gasket, which lets light in but also improves circulation so the screen doesn't fog.  I have a large fan blow on me all the time when I play VR (hehe).Cameras are disabled.  ????.  Passthrough is totally disabled even though the cameras are there.  It's a huge downgrade.  Should be software-fixable, but jeez it's been awhile now without a fix.  I find myself wanting an Index at times for the computer vision.Finally, I worry for future of HTC only because market share of the Cosmos and Cosmos Elite are soooo tiny.  This has me concerned that the ""futureproofing"" may not go far.  But ultimately, with lots of tweaking, I've come to adore this device.  It rivals its competitors just fine.The only economic type downside here is the 1.0 base station hardware.  This is only an issue if you want to add more than two base stations, in my opinion.  The only reason I considered adding more base stations is to improve tracking when using things like rifle stock addons which limit the number of visible sensors on the controllers.  In the end, for Pavlov VR (my pet game), a stock is not the best option, so this setup does everything I want.  You may want to use Index controllers later (they are not clearly better; I know pros use a mix of Vive and Index controllers); these are backwards-compatible with this setup.

I'm told to downgrade my graphics care and/or computer to accommodate their system. Why should I have to downgrade because they are not up to speed? This bespeaks of an inferior product that is still stuck behind the technological curve. Do not buy if your card is higher than what they want you to have. You'll be severely disappointed and frustrated. As more people adopt the new graphics card standard, this product and company will face declining revenue and profit to the detriment of the stock holders. I would not invest in this company till they get up to speed and modernize their products. No patch is offered, which indicates they are not even trying to advance their product as this has been an issue since the RTX 3000 series has been for sale.

So I pre ordered this VR headset and I was really excited to  get it. When it came I immediately read all the directions I could, set up my vive account and watched some youtube videos on how to get it up and running since this is all new to me. Long story short after doing plenty of research I had everything set up properly and everything was working up until I put on the headset. My gaming laptop was tracking the movement on the computer and I was in the game, but my headset wouldn't turn on. Its definitely a bad cable from inside the headset connecting to the computer. Iv'e had a few people look at it and have agreed. To me this was a waste of time and I strongly recommend another VR company since Iv'e tried reaching out to the company itself and they are impossible to get in contact with. Sorry but I am not impressed by this product, especially since I paid so much. ): I hope this helps.

The first 3 days, the headset worked okay, with intermittent problems that only seemed to get worse as time went on. It would crash randomly, struggle to find the headset, or give static-y audio through the headphones. At the end, it would crash every time the Vive Console would launch from SteamVR, despite multiple reinstalls, and even on a fresh system.I can also echo the complaint others have mentioned about the very small sweet spot for a clear image; due primarily to the large forehead pad. Any significant movement can make things blurry very quickly, which I haven't had a problem with on other VR headsets.I ended up returning this kit for a refund, as it was not working and I was unimpressed with the quality for the price. I've since ordered a Valve Index.

So I just finished putting together my OC liquid cooled computer. This thing is a monster. Finally got my hands on a 3080 and everything. This VR works 10% of the time. 90% of the time is spent with customer service saying on that one photo on the wall is too shiny, or you have a slightly reflective book in the room. But these tiny issues shouldn't make me sick when I turn my head 5 degrees. Total I've spent over 35 hours on Vive support just to realize this VR is trash. AMAZING when it works but getting it to work will probably need someone with a PhD in C++ to re code and spend the time to fix whatever is actually going on to make this so unplayable.

Overall it looks nice - if you focus only on the center point of the FOV.  the peripheral  is very blurry due to the unit not sitting squarely on the face.  If it was locked in place, it would be ok.  I have to hold the thing against my face to not have any blurriness. After a few hours of playing Beat Saber, my eyes hurt and i have a decently strong headache.

The best part about this is that you don't have to create a social media account to use it. Unlike another brand :( It's worth it to upgrade to the version with the flip up visor so you can see the room and what's in it without taking the entire thing off. It does not have pass through cameras. This is more comfortable to wear than the other brand, and both of those are more comfortable than the one made by the gaming console company. (yes, I can't get a review through that mentions brand names) It seems like there are more accessories available for this than for the Other Brand.  Once you set it up and learn how to move without actually walking, you could use it sitting down, too.

So this is supposed to be better from previous VR headsets. But it's not.Display. Vive Pro display is better. If we talk about SDE. Vive Pro and Elite have almost the same SDE. But ViVe pro has larger sweet spot. So has a sharper image all around.  Sweet spot on the vive elite is small because of that you se blurrier display arround the edges and because in vive elite LCD screens are used. In darker scenes the quality of the image is worse. I think audio is also better in vive pro than elite and comfort also. So vive pro is beter than elite if you are confused between the two.

The cable that connects to the headset and how the cable runs through the headset isnt designed for the flip up feature of the headset. I Only got a few month of use before the cable stopped working due to the strain on it caused by flipping the headset up.The headset is now useless until I purchase a new cable.An added annoyance is the headphones that come attached to the headset, they flip in and out to allow you to remove them without taking off the headset but they only have the two positions. Flipped out of course they are to far away from your head to hear anything, but flipped in they are so tight that slight movement of the head causes them to pop out, and there is no in-between position. Meaning that if it doesnt fit you perfectly they are useless and removing the headphones would require disassembling parts of the headset.So if you are someone who uses a VR headset on a regular basis, I would recommend trying other options before going with this headset, and if you do own this headset be careful when flipping the headset up.
