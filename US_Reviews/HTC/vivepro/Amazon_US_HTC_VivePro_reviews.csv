I own both the HTC Vive original model and the Vive Pro.  You're reading this because you're trying to figure out which one to buy - the Vive original that's just over $400 or the Pro which is .. a lot more.Short version - if you're new to VR and you're worried the Vive Original isn't good enough - it is.  At $400+ it's a steal. You get so much value for what's an introduction price to typical consoles that you really can't go wrong.  If you're waffling on your decision, go with the Original and you'll be a happy camper.For those of you, like me, who are constantly asking ""But what if this 'Pro' model is so much better?"".  It's nice - it's just not ""Holy cow I'm so happy I blew my paycheck"" nice.Undoubtedly you've read the professional reviews so here's the non-professional review - the kind of advice you wished your best friend would just give you.  They did everything right with this headset.  It's more comfortable, the resolution chops down on the ""screen door effect"" that the pixelated original feels like, and it just feels like a more polished experience overall.  Even the remote camera sensors are a bit sleeker.The problem with this generation of VR is just that they can't deliver a ""retina like"" experience anywhere close to the price point consumers are willing to pay.  So while the Vive Pro is better, we're still 2-3 years away from getting an experience that doesn't feel compromised.You're still dealing with the issue of having to look dead straight to get the picture to resolve correctly.  You can still see pixels, albeit fewer.  The headset is still a bit wonky and heavy.  It's still Gen 1 VR.  Think of this as the Iphone S model upgrade where it's a bit better, but you're still a generation behind.So I'd leave the decision tree like this -1.  Just testing VR and want to see if it's legit?  Buy the Original2.  Totally enamored with VR and can appreciate a subtle improvement.  Buy the Pro.VR is amazing - and I say that as a total cynic. Even though there are only a handful of games out they are so immersive that it doesn't matter.  Don't think of it like playing console or PC games.  In this cases while the graphics are always getting better, the experience is the same.  In the case of VR, even games I've played an unreasonable amount of hours on (like Fallout 4) on my PC feel like entirely new experiences.One last caution - VR lasts maybe an hour at a time.  After that, it gives you a bit of a headache.  It sucks because you want the experience to keep going, but putting blinding screens an inch+ from your eyes for any period of time is gonna add up.  Think of it more like a ride at a theme park than an all-night couch dwelling console session.

The Second Best Decision You Could Make

I had previously given this 5 stars and raved about how the upgraded resolution looks.  I’m sad to say I have to do a 180 on that review.  After less than a month of using my vive Pro it started having various issues across the board.  I was getting red, green, blue static dots and both the video and audio would separately go out, or go out together.I contacted vive support and after going through troubleshooting steps with them that I had already tried on my own they finally agreed to send me a replacement cable to see if that was the issue (this was the link cable that goes from the hmd to the link box).  The replacement cable did not fix the issue yet support forced me to do the same troubleshooting steps yet again!  Finally they agreed to set it up for repair.  So I sent it out AT MY OWN COST and after 3 weeks to a month I got it back, in worse condition than I sent it out in!  Now all I get is flashing light and never see or hear ANYTHING!So let me ask you what kind of company charges $800 for something that NEVER works right, has you go through painstaking steps before agreeing to let YOU pay to send it to them and then sends it back to you even more broken than it was before?!  I currently have an email out to HTC about this and am waiting to hear back.  I will update this review if HTC turns this situation around for me and gets me a working vive pro but as of now it has been one of if not the worst experience I’ve ever had with a consumer electronic!

I own the original VIVE headset since it debuted a couple of years ago. I decided to buy the PRO version for business, because of all the positive reviews about its reliability and increased resolution.Set-up: overall, it was pretty bad. I've read the stories about the long setup process that the PRO headset requires. I chose not to believe them, because I thought of myself as a pretty experienced person with VR. After all, I have the original VIVE and know how to deal with software updates and troubleshoot issues.Well, friends, I was wrong. At first everything was fine, as the little program that I downloaded from the HTC website was guiding me through the process. Then I was asked to sign in with the HTC account, so that I can ""enjoy"" my several months of free membership of their VR store. I googled around, and there was no way of continuing the installation of the headset without the HTC account. DEAR HTC, please don't drag me into your store if I am not interested. As a customer, I don't appreciate the strong-arming. I don't need another store subscription. I know what you are thinking: ""he bought the headset, he has the installation running = he is invested deep enough now that he will register for the store account, even if he doesn't really want it."" Nice calculus, but I am no longer a happy customer of yours after this kind of treatment.Long story short, I did register for the HTC account; I singed in with my Steam account. Moving on, the HTC install program did not recognize my USB 3 port as USB 3, no matter how I tried. USB 3 is required for optimum performance of the two cameras on the headset. That's fine, I thought, let's just skip this step. Then the installation program proceeded to download a whole bunch of stuff, including their store program which I did not really need, all in excess of 1 gig.  At this point, I felt the process was becoming too involving. I was asked then to update all the software in the headset itself and the controllers. When all was done, at the end of the installation, I began receiving error messages from HTC software trying to sort things out with the Steam store and Steam VR. It was confusing and annoying, like watching two stores - HTC and STEAM -  fight it out on my desktop. I also downloaded the latest NVIDIA drivers (I run a 1080 card), and updated windows as well.Actual Use:I installed the lighthouses in the same spots where I had the original VIVE lighthouses installed. These things were supposed to be better, so I was pretty excited. Set up Room Scale VR as usual, set AUDIO in Steam VR to HMD, put on the headset and... the word to describe how I felt is ""underwhelming."" Many reviews say the screen door effect is ""almost gone"", ""barely visible"", or even ""totally solved."" I don't know how much these websites depend on advertising revenue from Steam or HTC, but the screen door effect is - clearly, 100%, in-your-face - there. I wasn't trying to look for it, I just wanted to focus on the image, but the screen door effect was photo-bombing everything just like it does in the original VIVE that was made 2 years ago.Yes, the headset is more comfortable than the original! And like most reviewers claim, it is a big deal. This is the only positive thing that I can say about the headset.Performance: With my 1080 card, I did not notice any jitter or frame drops. However, I had a lot of tracking issues where the floor would start flying from underneath me, or I would be pushed into the wall in the VR. I did room set up many many many times, and I adjusted the lighthouses many many many many times, trying all possible angles. I troubleshoot the headset for defective hardware, all was good. Did the setups again, and again received tracking madness. I switched back My original VIVE, and everything worked rock-solid. Then I did some googling, and it is a known issue. It seems, this new VIVE PRO is super-susceptible to issues if there are reflective surfaces nearby. I have several windows in my VR area that I suspect were causing the problem. However, my original VIVE has zero issues with those windows. I thought the VIVE PRO is supposed to be BETTER, right? I mean, more reliable? What's up with this, HTC? How come my original VIVE performs better than your newest PRO version? I bought this for business, I don't have time tinkering with it all the time. My original VIVE seems to be more PRO reliable than this newest, super-expensive, ""PRO"" version.In the end, I decided to return VIVE PRO, because it feels like a step backward to me. Even the plastic looks cheap compared to the original version. Same with presentation - the box is horrible. Seems like HTC just doesn't care as much as they cared when they released the original headset. It feels like they were trying to cut costs with this (and charge an arm and a leg at the same time, to make it a winning business strategy).Here's my recommendation:- if you have the original VIVE, buy a strap with built-in headphones, and your VIVE will be as comfortable as the new one. The resolution bump sounds impressive on paper, but in real life, you will -barely- notice it. Barely. Wait until HTC gets it game together and produces a truly next generation VR headset. This VIVE PRO is a scam.- if you don't have any VR headset and want one now; buy the original VIVE if you want superior tracking, plus the wireless add-on, plus the strap with built-in headphones. You will have a superior VR experience, AND save a ton of money that you can put towards the next generation VR when it comes out, spend on a Hawaiian vacation, invest in the stock market, or whatever you want to do with it. VIVE PRO is just too glitchy.Still feel like you want VIVE PRO? Then read all the horror stories on redit about people spending weeks and months trying to make the tracking work. Google ""VIVE Pro tracking issues"". Still want to buy it? I totally understand, why believe someone else's experience, when you can witness these problems first-hand? Go ahead and buy it. Amazon has a great return policy.To those of you who happen to have zero reflective surfaces in or near your VR area, and your PRO is working for you - good for you. I still don't understand how my original VIVE works so flawlessly in same area where this ""PRO"" version is a total puke-inciting mess. What's going on with you, HTC?

So i bought this headset around January 20th and loved it, it's great... although it broke on me. Less than 2 months of owning the thing it stopped working and came with tons of error messages... Well I sent it into HTC repair and waited...and just kept waiting. about a month later I contact them asking the status of my headset and am told to wait 2 weeks. Two weeks pass and no update so I contact them again and am told I will hear something in two days... well that passes and nothing, about 20 days later I finally get an email saying the repairs for my headset will cost $270. WHAT?! I waited 2 months for a response and am told I have to pay nearly half the amount I payed to get the headset in the first place to get it repaired??? I owned it for less than 2 months before it broke, you're telling me the headsets aren't under some sort of warranty for anytime longer than that?! The headset is great but if you come across any need to send it in to repair, don't, HTC as a company is trash and will hold your headset for an outrageous amount of time before pretty much telling you ""OH Just pay for a new headset!""

My Vive only worked for six weeks.  I bought it in late December 2017, and it stopped working in early February 2018.  I returned it to HTC for repair in on February 9, 2018.  As of May 15, 2018, all they will tell me is that ""they are working on it,"" but have no other updates.  HTC refuses to send a replacement, and cannot give me an estimate time to complete.I would recommend against buying anything from HTC.

Bought this in October. 2017 and at first was very pleased  By February one of the sensors had a fault that seems to be common online (FAULT 03).  I initiated a request for RMA with HTC and sent it in.  This was received by HTC on 2/20 and it is now April 19th and they not only have not replaced it, they cannot commit to a date, nor is there any guidance when this will be fixed.  I have had better customer experience with Spectrum cable than HTC.  Each week I start a new chat (only way to engage their support) and I am told something to the extent below2/26 ""Thank you for patiently waiting. I was able to check the repair details and it shows that the device was received 02/20/18. The repair process will take 7-10 business days from the day that we receive the device. Once done you will be notified via email with the tracking information for you to know when you will receive your device back.""3/12 ""Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience you may have experienced in respect to the device.Your case has been escalated personally to our upper management. They have confirmed receipt of the escalation, and are diligently working towards a resolution. Once a resolution is obtained, we will contact you with the results""3/20 "" I took the time to read your email and I found that you have an issue with the Base Station fault 03. I understand your frustration with this eventuality. I know how excited you are playing with the amazing HTC Vive. They are amazing!  Don’t worry you are in the best hands to solve the issue.""3/21 - ""We know the process is taking more than expected and we apologize for it, the process has been escalated, it means your device is in priority and as soon as our techs finish with it you are going to be notify with the outbound tracking number.  Thanks for being part of the HTC family!""  BTW, they suggested I try a new game on a system that is not working4/2 "" I completely understand your concern related to the repair of your base station, and yes, you have an escalation, they didn’t contact you yet because we don’t have additional updates like a return tracking number or something like that. Nevertheless, we are working really hard in having this resolved for you as soon as possible. Please give us a few days more and as soon as we get anything we will reach you back.""4/16- ""I called RMA in order to check if we have more updates but for the moment, we have to still waiting, I know you are really worried and frustrated at this point, trust me, but we are keen to resolve this as much as you are, please give us one more week and as soon as we get any additional detail we will reach you back with it.""I would not reccomend anyone buy from this supplier based on this horrible customer experience

It's hard to do bulleted, concise reviews on something like this.. So this will be a little long winded. Stick with me if you can..If you were like me, you might be a little hesitant about tech like this, because you tried a GEAR VR, or think 3d desktop gaming and 3d movies are kinda of cool, but certainly not worth this kind of investment. Get that out of your head right now. This is COMPLETELY different.First, let me say that I've never been a huge gamer. I've spent many more hours on my 10 year old Wii than I have on newly released console/computer games.I enjoy the interaction even if I'm sacrificing graphical beauty.This system is kind of like a 5th generation Wii. They are really selling the experience more than the graphics. And the experience is absolutely something to be had.Kind of like that first time you picked up that wii controller and ""bowled"" and thought ""hey, this is pretty cool."" but on a WHOLE new level.Once you complete the setup you'll enter the tutorial and blow up a balloon.. You'll (without instruction) think.. What happens if I try to hit this floating balloon.. Probably nothing.. but you'll immediately realize how intuitive and accurate this ""new world"" is when the balloon flies in the direction and velocity you would expect it to based on your hand movement. And sure there are similar capabilities on other consoles. You separate when you realize you can (literally) walk underneath the balloon, look up at it, jump and swat it down to the floor.  then walk circles around it while unrelentingly taunting it for obeying physics.When you play ""The lab"" and your hand becomes a spaceship in a (truly) 3d realm, you'll really grasp what this thing is all about.  I can't imagine how silly it looks in real life with your hand just jerking up and down, left to right, ducking, spinning.. etc. But in the game it really feels like you're in a serious situation and your hand needs to dodge these incoming blobs at all costs.The longbow game is fun. And you may realize that the controllers are giving haptic feedback when you ""pull"" the bowstring and release it to give it that additional sense of immersion.It's these seemingly small, polished edges that make this an incredible product.You WILL feel immersed. I 100 percent guarantee it. You'll laugh the first time you try to set your gun down on a table in the virtual world.The setup wasn't bad. Although I didn't find instructions included. I just googled it and followed the 10ish step process from HTC.Windows 7 wouldn't install the drivers for the ""link box"" until I put it into the USB 2.0 slots (as others have stated) - the directions state that it's compatible with 2.0+ though. Maybe in later versions of Windows, or perhaps my BIOS settings are ""bad"". Either way, simple fix.I had planned on using the single HDMI port that my GTX1060 has since I saw that some people had problems through other connections. The directions stated that you can use a display port to mini display port on the link box but I didn't try it.So that makes two display ports out. One to my tv/monitor, the other to my receiver which passes the video to a projector, and then the HDMI to the Vive headset. All very seamless.When you get to the point of powering on all your components (for the first time) you might need to right click one of the controllers in the steam VR window and click ""pair controller"" (if the controller shows blue when it comes on instead of green). The walkthrough failed to mention that.The Steam VR software is very polished as well. Especially inside of VR. You can switch to your desktop and read email. When I realized that I could walk closer to my boundary wall that the desktop was on at that time, and the text got closer/clearer, it was an additional level of ""that's friggin cool.""This is NOT for reading text like that though. The resolution just isn't there.Once you've got a Steam account set up, be careful, it's easy to blow through 80 dollars (of real money) in a 4 minute virtual shopping spree.You can connect your phone via Bluetooth and get notifications. You can enable the camera and see the room without taking the headset off. Plug in ear buds and ""mirror"" the sound so you can rock out hard to audioshield without waking the neighbors.You can control pretty much all of the aspects of the virtual world from your 2d monitor. That comes in handy If someone new is using the headset. So you can control the session for them (get them into a game, get them started, etc) without having to walk them through everything - but again, it is pretty intuitive and should be easy to pick up for 90 percent of people.There are just a lot of features that you can tell they put thought into.Some complain that a lot of the games are ""demo"" types, and while that's true. There are several ""full"" games available, and I haven't even gotten to them, because The Lab, Zombie Trainer, The Brookhaven Experiment, and (especially) AudioShield have me completely satisfied for the time being.We're all still waiting on the ""major"" releases of Doom, Fallout 4, Serious Sam, Arizona Sunshine etc. I am curious how games like Serious Sam will work. You're going to break yourself if you're constantly spinning around trying to fend off hordes of suiciders. The action of ""teleporting"" in large scale games seems to be the goto method for moving around in the world. It's not as intuitive as I'd like and it takes a split second to load the new landscape when you arrive, so it's a little offputting. But that's splitting hairs at this point. I just feel like it's going to be exaggerated when you're in a true ""sandbox"" world.There are a few cons.1. You're going to have a tough time doing true multiplayer with this. You can't just buy another 30 dollar controller and go to town with your friend sitting on the couch next to you. You're looking at another large investment and the space to set up another system. I'm interested to see how games like ""Don't stop talking and nobody explodes"" work and bring a ""crowd"" together with one headset. But it's probably not going to be the excitement of being (virtually) back to back with a buddy fighting the terrorists in a FPS.2. I hope your friends don't mind swapping a large amount of face sweat.3. The resolution just isn't what it is on a LED monitor. Obviously you're stretching that image out over a 360 degree 3d environment so it's a little tougher to do. So.. Again, you're not doing this for the ""crispness"". You're doing it for the experience. When you feel like a freaking rockstar defending yourself from incoming musical notes, you won't be thinking about the slight pixilation, or how the graphics in the background aren't super detailed. I PROMISE.4. I find it a little bit of a pain to get the headset just right on my head. You need to get the straps perfect (not too tight, or loose) to make the area right in front of your face perfectly clear (especially when you're looking down).5. I don't think the screens are quite big enough. You will probably notice the black ring around the outside of your vision when you're waiting for a game to load or whatever. You'll forget about it as soon as you're doing whatever.6. I am seriously matting down the new carpet inside of my ""game area.""7. You might think that the real world is less fun.Keep in mind.. That while the software is pretty polished and works well, this type of thing probably isn't for someone who isn't at least a moderate ""power user."" I've had some minor issues like weird Steam crashes, VR world disappearing if the CPU is under a lot of stress, computer not completing POST when the link box was plugged in. Just stuff that you wouldn't deal with on a console type system. This ""limitation"" (not the price) is probably why the world isn't screaming about this from the rooftops. The mass population isn't exactly tech savvy so that excludes a major percentage of potential buyers.All that said....Honestly, I've got a lot of cool stuff but this is ABSOLUTELY and UNEQUIVOCALLY the coolest tech I've seen or played with in my entire life. I would still be happy with it if I would've needed to fork out an additonal 800 or so to build a computer. Everytime I'm away from it for a day or so, I think ""was it really THAT cool?"" and I answer my question as soon as I put the headset back on and enter a virtual world for what feels like the first time, every time.

Like others have said, yes it has better visuals, but not by a lot. That being said, I can never go back to the old Vive that I own. The comfort is underestimated, it allows you to have longer VR sessions which is what its all about!  The sound is ""good enough"" nothing bad and nothing great. Its simply good sound.-Reading Text is much better! (that also goes for UI's, Health bars, ammo bars etc!..-Seeing gun crosshairs is WAY easier! (you can hit targets! your aim is on point!)-Seeing farther and clearer is HUGE! (I shot a arrow straight up in Skyrim and followed it all the way down!)The Pro blocks out the real world like a Champion! no light passes though the nose guard (which is more comfortable I might add) And the headphones cups your ears to block out outside noise. what this translates to is a more immersive experience and longer VR sessions which is a HUGE plus! I mean its what its all about, right?!This small bump is actually HUGE why? because its just the right amount of tech that still runs the current hardware! We are a few years away from a proper Gen 2 HMD, (that also goes for the computer hardware to run the new HMD) so this will pass the time if its worth it to you.Simply put, if you want the best VR.. look no further, this is it.  The best room-scale tracking coupled with this HMD will allow you to experience the absolute best VR that's currently available!A personal note:I have to say, after modding the hell out of Skyrim it does LOOK SICK (45+ mods and tweaks). I was chilling behind Riverwood at night (with darker nights mod) crouched with my back against the mountain, listening to the sounds looking up at the insane sky with stars shining and the moon, cloud movement dancing on the mountain tops etc...Just taking it all in, it was so awe inspiring, I am constantly at a loss of words with this setup. This is a expensive unit, no doubt.. but do you think for a second I would trade it for the countless ""oh crap!"" moments i've had, not on your life!As a kid in the 80's staring at store shelves filled with awesome hand drawn box cover art of high fantasy PC games. Wishing I could just teleport inside those images and explore the majestic worlds within, now finally after all these years, here I am.I took a few screenshots last night, just to capture the moment, but it doesn't tell the tale. Whiterun in the distance, with a glorious celestial  event. Being INSIDE this world is AMAZING.

This is an amazing product that will blow your mind.... That is until it stops working. I did the usual trial and error fixes, but the headset went out and it was beyond something I could fix. So naturally I sent it in for repair. There is no phone number to contact support, so I initiated the chat. (Bad start) the rep was friendly and walked through all steps for repair. Nothing worked, so the rep told me to send it in and they'd repair it under warranty for 2-3 weeks. Seemed normal, I've done this before. I sent it in waited my 3 weeks but hadn't heard anything back. I chatted again, the rep was nice and told me there were delays, another 1-2 weeks. Again I understand there are delays, I wait 2 more weeks... Nothing. Contact them again and am a little more worked up now, told them to escalate me. 1 week later still heard nothing. Ive contacted the BBB (which I've never done before) and the issue is ongoing. It's been 2 months ,and I paid 600 dollars for this premium device. Do yourself a favor and buy anything else to get a good reality experience, outside the virtual reality.

I am changing my review from a 5 star rating to a 1 star rating due to the terrible customer service that HTC offers.I have owned the Vive Pro a little over 6 months and the link box died 2 months ago. After calling Amazon, I was referred to HTC for warranty repair; no problem I thought. I created a ticket through their email system same-day the link box died.*****There is no Customer Support Phone Number and if you do try another HTC department thinking you can escalate, HTC still cannot help you***** It took over a week for someone from HTC to respond. After getting stuck into a month loop of questions and waiting days for a response, HTC finally agrees to exchange my link box. We'll it's been over 3 weeks since the agreement, and I still do no have a a tracking number or have received the new link box. I am also not getting a response on the emails asking if the device has shipped. Yes, this box is around 40-50 bucks, however it is the principle of the matter that the warranty department refuses to service the issue or care about their customers.When the Vive Pro works, it's solid and way better than anything I have tried on the market. I have a friend that has the Oculus and another that has a regular Vive. Both have purchased the Vive Pro after trying my Pro out. Now, I regret influencing them in-case their Pro has issue and they are ran through the nightmare I am going through.Take my comments as a grain of salt, however this is an expensive product and you would think HTC would care about their customers. Especially the early buyers. All I can say, buyer BEWARE!

Let me preface that I am (was) a diehard HTC supporter when it comes to VR. I tried Oculus Rift, several Windows MR headsets, and HTC Vive (the original, not Pro). I felt that Vive had the best implementation as far as tracking, expandability, and connectivity to PC. Some feel that Oculus controllers are better, but personally I prefer Vive wands. I have owned original Vive for over a year and the whole family (and friends) love to use it and play VR games. With that said, I purchased Vive Pro at a (ridiculously) high price because to me it was worth it and I was looking forward to upgrades. What a disappointment it was! Just to be clear - I ordered two different headsets and one full Vive Pro kit (with new 2.0 base stations and new 2.0 controllers) because I wanted to make sure I didn’t get a dud. I experienced various issues with all of them and they were all returned. The tracking was worse comparing to my original Vive, one headset would not keep the floor leveled no matter what I tried and how many times I ran room calibration, controllers would not always show up, constant connection issues when headset would need to be re-plugged, one headset would have flickering lights in the HMD… etc. It was just awful, and it was in exact same large room that is perfect for VR that my original Vive works perfectly, connected to the same high-power gaming rig. I re-installed Windows fresh twice thinking maybe it was related to previous Vive installation or something similar, so I started fresh and the same issues persisted. I spent hours on user forums, reddit, HTC support forum looking for answers and was amazed how many people have similar issues and all the crazy workarounds one need to do to get it to work properly sometimes.With all that, the worst part was HTC support. I contacted them to see what they can suggest in one of the scenarios and after explaining everything that I have already tried, the rep said that HMD must be defective and needs to be sent to them for repairs and it is covered under warranty. Here is the kick though – as others mentioned in reviews, you have to pay to ship anything to HTC out of your pocket, they won’t reimburse you or provide a shipping label even though the product is defective, they won’t do advance exchange, you have to wait at least two weeks... and if they determine (at their own discretion) that it is something that is not covered by the warranty you will have to either pay to have it fixed (at a quote they will give you later) or have to pay to get your non-working part back. Needless to say, I simply returned all of them to the retailers I bought them from and I will never buy it again. I have since talked to several other VR users that had very similar experiences with Vive Pro. I understand that any product can have issues and kinks may need to work out, but when the company doesn’t stand behind the product they have built and does not support the adopters of their products – this is really the worst business practice and the easiest way to push your supporters away. I would highly recommend doing your research before buying HTC Vive Pro, most likely you will be disappointed and will not enjoy it; and if you’ll need support from HTC – be ready to pay more and wait. I still think that original Vive is a good product and I continue using it. One of my base stations stopped working on the original Vive and even though it was still under warranty I had to pay shipping and wait two weeks to get it fixed… oh well… at least I can still use it an enjoy it. My next VR set will NOT be an HTC product unless the company addresses the bugs and more importantly changes their customer support approach.

This device is life changing. I'm a huge gamer. I'll admit, an unhealthy addict. Sitting in front of a desktop PC doesn't do my body any good at all. It's been causing me anxiety, loss of sleep and disappointment in myself. I was assuming the Vive would just add to it, but I had to have it anyway. The result were entirely unexpected. In less than a week I've exercised more than I have in years and had a BLAST doing so. I actually WANT to exercise more than my body can handle. My entire body is sore and I'm loving it.I feared that I would use the Vive as a form of escape and ignore my real world responsibilities and kill my social life. The exact opposite has happened. This is not a casual toy. If you intend to use it room scale, it takes a lot of planning. There are sensors to set up, a good amount of space needed, a LOT of cable management. It works best if you have an entire room dedicated to VR, but not all of us are fortunate enough to have that kind of space.Something you will learn early on is that when you take off the headset and return to the real world, you want your real world settings to be pleasing. The last thing you want to see when you return is a sink full of dishes, dirty laundry, clutter or anything that would cause you disappointment. My apartment is now spotless and totally in order. Half of my living room is set up for the Vive. I have a welcoming, clean open space complete with yoga mats. I now live in my previously unused workout clothes.This is an experience to share. My friends are totally blown away. This didn't decrease my social life. Again, it did the opposite. I'm inviting my MOTHER over! GASP! That never happens! :)  She used to be an avid scuba diver but can no longer dive due to health issues. Next week I'm taking her scuba diving in my living room! My friend's wife was trying to plan a small surprise birthday for him but they're new in town and don't know many people. I offered to host the gathering at my place. Why not? It's now clean! We had a wonderful evening. I'm planning on having people over most weekends to have fun and explore the possibilities the Vive offers. It's a joy to share!My PC gaming addiction is gone. POOF! Just like that. I never would thing this would happen. Yes, I'm still playing games, but I'm fully active. Very active. I moved almost non stop for 3.5 hours yesterday. I'm much more aware of my time. I don't feel depressed or that I'm missing out or hiding from life. I feel exhilarated.This does not come without a price. Please know that the current $799 price is just the beginning. You will need a top of the line computer with a powerful graphics card in order to run the Vive properly. Being a big gamer, I already had the computer ($1100 about six months ago) but I still had to upgrade to a GeForce 1070, which currently runs just over $400. Tripods and mounts: $60. Applications run from free to about $30 each. I've dropped a couple of hundred on games in the first week.Budget your money, budget your space, know what you have to do to get this set up, get your act together and THEN buy this. Your story might end differently than mine, but I hope if anything it's better.And for the love of all that is holy, buy Audioshield. It's by far my most used app and SOOOOOOOO much fun

I really regret buying this unit, it is very clear that HTC does not do any quality assurance or take seriously the integrity of their product. I received the components but with a faulty base station out of the box. To be clear, one of the base stations never worked out of the box, I didn't even have time to use it to potentially break it. I contacted HTC a couple times and the first exchange they were very skeptical and asked me to try a bunch of different setups (which I already tried before contacting them) and then stopped helping me mid-consultation because they had to go on break and never returned or contacted me again. I did everything on my end to make the base station work as I don't like returning things especially something that I really really wanted to enjoy with friends. I am still actively trying to get my base station fixed by HTC. They even warned me before starting the return that it could take a months time to fix because of ""a high volume of repair requests"" according to one of the HTC techs, which was a big red flag for me. I have been waiting for 46 days since they received the base station with no contact whatsoever and no explanations. To put it into perspective I received the Vive on 2/8/18.  The base stations are riddled with moving parts and if you receive a faulty one it will be really loud and make clicking noises and vibrate the wall if it is attached at the wall, I suggest returning the entire kit instead of trying to get them to repair something that they didn't get right the first time. HTC's customer service and product quality is egregious, I would not buy from them until a new tracking technology is developed that is made by a different company. The rest of the product works fine, but the base stations not working ruins everything and stops you in your tracks. I still don't know what its like to play Skyrim VR on my own Vive almost 5 months after purchase. Attached is a picture of my repair tracking which is what you will see when your base station fails and start a return/repair.

I have had a regular Vive with Deluxe Audio Strap and have played it almost daily for about a year so I have a solid experience with which to compare. There is a price premium on the Pro and it's not for everyone. If you are budget conscious, there's no need to save up to buy the Pro. If you like the best of what's available, then give this one a shot.1) Set-up was a breeze. I followed the instructions offered on the Vive website (although you could just install it without referring to the website as it's very obvious what needs to be done). Important to note: The original Vive plugged into an HDMI connector on my video card. The Pro requires the display port adapter on the video card. I also manually forced a firmware update on the headset.2) The unit ships with ONE face pad while the original Vive shipped with two (Wide and Narrow). The face pad for the Pro is slightly larger along the top edge. The original face pads will work with it but they don't provide as much padding but it's not really noticeable). So far, nobody sells face pads for the Vive Pro (not even HTC).3) The display is noticeably clearer. When I put on the Pro headset and stood in the Steam VR Home, I was amazed at the difference. The graininess and screen doo effect are noticeably reduced. It's not perfect but it IS an improvement which you can see. When in games, the improvements eventually fade into the normal playing experience but everything does look better. This helps with reading text (particularly flight sims).4) The comfort of the Pro headset is improved. It rests on the head with better balance and fit. It requires more adjustments when swapping between players. The Deluxe head strap was much easier to adjust quickly.5) The audio is about the same as the deluxe head strap. I haven't seen any improvement in quality or comfort. I do like the inclusion of a volume adjustment and microphone mute button on the ear pieces.6) Adjustment buttons. I like the simplified adjustment used to move the display closer or further from your eyes. Apparently you can do this on the original Vive but it required pressing two buttons. The IPD adjustment knob (adjusts the left-right spacing of the lenses) is a little more difficult to turn. The old one was a know which you could turn by twisting it between your thumb and finger. The Pro is more of a hheel than you need to use a finger to rotate. Not a big deal, but it's something I noticed..Overall, I am happy I have this as I like to have the best experiences I can when playing. At the current price, it's not for everyone and for most, I would say that buying the normal Vive will more than satisfy, especially if you take the money saved and buy a better video card. One crowd that might like this are hardcore flight sim players as there tends to be a lot of text which you need to read. The Pro certainly helps make the text  more legible.

When it works it is amazing. I bought mine in August of 2017 and loved it from the start... until December 22nd 2017. On that fateful morning I had an error code for one of the base stations. So I tried to call Vive support.  There is NO phone support for this $600.00 device.  I followed the links and started a chat on the support site. And shortly determined that the base station was no longer tracking and would need to be RMA'ed.  I was told 7-10 business days for repair.  Now that close to the holidays I understood that 7-10 days was more like 3 weeks. I boxed it up and sent it off. It was signed for at HTC on 12/28/17.  It was not checked into repair, repair.. not warranty exchange, until 01/12/18. 14 day's after being signed for.  As of today 03/20/2018 I still do not have my base station back.  I have given so many broken promises at this point that I just laugh.  I have been lied to more times that I can count.  I have come to believe the plan is to hold my part hostage until the warranty expires and the tell me I have to buy a new one. My Vive has been hanging on my wall for three months unusable.  I will update this review if I ever get my base station back.Update 04/25/2018  Still no base station.  ""We hope to have your tracking number next week""  that is the 15th week in a row for that answer.Update 05/12/2018  After my review came to the attention of HTC customer relations I was able to get a replacement shipped to me. I arrived and I am now happily playing in the VR world again.  I have been told that the RMA and Repair department moved locations around the time my issue started.  I can only assume that some parts were misplaced. I am seeing a lot less of these issues in recent reviews.5/18/18 after all of this my original repaired base station showed up just three days after the replacement.  When I contacted Vive support I was told ""Now you have a spare. Thank you for doing business with HTC"". I have to say this not a company that does things with moderation. When they are bad they are VERY bad. And when they are good they are Great!

Initially I enjoyed my Vive, however, less than 2 months in and my controllers track pad stopped working correctly.  I contacted Vive and initially they were very helpful and promised the turn around to get it repaired would be 2-3 weeks.  They have had the controller back for over 5 weeks and apparently haven't even taken it out of the box yet.  I have contacted their online support  weekly and every time I am told that they will contact me in a couple days with a status update.  There has been zero communication initiated from them in the 5 weeks they have had it.  The best I can get from their support team is that they want to make me happy (Not by replacing it, not by shipping it back to me so I can fix it, not by telling me what is wrong with it) and they will contact me in a few days with a status update, which is of course, still hasn't happened once.3 months and no response to my last email for 2 days now.  Worst customer service I have experienced in a long time.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU WILL BE SORRY.

This review is about how the product was shipped.  Unless I made a complete mistake I was buying a used very good condition.  I can live without the original packaging but as u can see from the picture they dumped the equipment loose in a box twice as large as need and put absolutely nothing in to protect it not even a air pillow.  Picture is from the moment I opened the box, the head set seems fine but the infrared modules are very scuffed up.  I'm.going to see if the scuffs effect anything and I need to take a close look at the lenses.  Right tnow I'm very un happy

I never thought something would reignite my excitement for gaming like this did.At first I was honestly a little meh. I saw the screen door effect, look around and thought it was cool, but not 800 (what I bought it for, now it's 600) worthy cool. Then I turned on my first game.I sat down in my chair to play Eve Valkerie, and was taken aback. My body was being tricked and I almost felt the weird feeling of the pitch and yaw of the ship. Then I played Rec Room. I played this for hours on end and didn't think I could have so much fun spinning around my living room. Then I went to throw a frisbee in the game and hit my tripod and threw my lighthouse sensor hurling into the floor.Luckily it didn't break (so 10/10 on durability)To me this was the moment that really put it in my head how immersed I was. I got to watch my family have the same experiences (minus the lighthouse slamming). They ducked and dove into the floor playing Raw Data, and I had never seen my family enjoy video games so much, let alone enjoy them at all.Basically if you're debating it, pull the trigger. There may be 5 seconds you regret it once you put it on, but after those 5 seconds you'll wonder why you didn't buy it a year ago.

Product works as intended and is pretty neat. Unfortunately, the customer service from HTC is absolutely horrendous. I will not purchase anything from this company moving forward.  A small removable paper clip size/looking clip that holds the head strap to the headset popped off and was lost. I contacted support and they informed me I’d have to send in the headset alone for the repair technicians to put the clip in the box to send it back. I’d have to pay shipping there and it could be a $270 repair charge.  Im talking about a $1.50 metal clip. This company tries to extract as much money from their customers as they can. Why don’t they sell this simple clip for $5-$10 on their website at minimum? I just purchased this unit a few months ago. If they cared anything about their customers, they would see I provided proof of purchase, pictures, and a serial number (unit is still under warranty) and send me a pair of these clips free of charge in an envelope 2 day shipping.

Love the VR experience; play Beat Saber now!I held off until the second generation Vive came out thinking it would somehow be better and the kinks would be worked out. However, my nephew also purchased an Oculus Rift a week after I purchased the Vive Pro for 1/3 the price and there is no noticeable differences in game play.  SteamVR errors constantly pop up telling me programs are already running. Sensor setup is tricky to get right.My nephew plays games while I play around with setup. The Vive is still in development stages. Purchase it only if you like to fiddle around to get things to work.Update: After the first few weeks I started having serious tracking problems with the controllers and headset. Read many of the news groups and tried many of the fixes (reinstall, new USB port, disable camera tracking etc) but it still doesn't work. Tired to do a return for a refund but found out I was 5 days past the deadline. Really, really, wish I purchased an Oculus Rift and saved a bunch of headaches and money!

I got this for my son at the end of Oct. 2017. A few weeks later the base station started acting up. Reading online we saw that there was a “fix” of installing some software but it was only temporary as everyone who had already dealt with this issue stated that not long after installing this bandaid the base station stopped working. Which is exactly what happened to us. We contacted CS who told us to do the update. My son told the person that he didn’t think it would fix the issue but was assured otherwise. Not long afterwards his base station stopped working. We sent it in Jan for repair and did not hear anything else from Vive until I initiated a chat on Feb 2nd. I was told the base station would be another week before it would be returned to us. SO...we bought it in October, got a couple of weeks use out of it and then unable to use it from when it stopped working in December 2017 until we get it back sometime mid February 2018. I asked the Non U.S. customer support rep during the chat if there was someone I could call to speak to about the issue but was told there is NO phone support for the Vive. Bottom line, when it worked, it was truly a cool product. Customer service/support is terrible to almost non existent.

Honestly, after reading a lot of the reviews saying the quality isn't ""that big of an improvement"" I was extremely hesitant to buy this. But man, I'm really glad I did. Where the headphones are garbage, you can remove them and use whatever headphones you see fit. (I use Wireless Steel Series Siberia 800, great headset to use with it) The strap is a little clunky, as it is easy to notch back if you try to get it too tight, however, you don't need it so tight it's breaking your face to use it properly.I've noticed a lot of people who seem to have problems with the lack of quality don't understand that your computer needs to be good enough to handle it. It's quite a lot more taxing on your system than the normal vive and thus wont work perfectly on every system that previously could use vive just fine. That being said, if you do have a computer that can handle the increased pixels, you'll definitely notice it.

Product has well known, wide spread design or manufacturing flaw that will result in many game track pads failing during normal use. HTC has phenomenally bad customer support that routinely loses or otherwise botches attempts by customers to get repairs or replacements. Both of my controllers failed during normal use within three months of purchase. Do not purchase a Vive until HTC a.) redesigns the controller to address the widely known and common trackpad failure and b.) overhauls it's customer service process to provide an acceptable level of customer service.

the customer support is terrible and they will end up doing more harm then good in some instances when you send your broken product in to HTC, and your product will break eventually. There is a known build defect in the controllers where it will stop tracking or stop clicking on the touch pad, if you send it in they will charge you for the repair and in some instances try to scam you by saying that the problem isn't covered by warranty for one reason or another and HTC will make you pay them to return the broken item to you.  They also use illegal warranty practices by putting these stickers in places that if removed voids your warranty, this is made illegal by the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act but they think they are above the law.I can't condone any of HTC's business practices they even changed the original warranty to weasel there way out of fixing there headset. The warranty used to say that it covered repairs for the headset if it was compromised by sweat but later they removed that clause!HTC hasn't put out any statements about the defects in there products or what they are doing to help fix the problems. They haven't had any replacement controllers for a couple of months now so unless you can see into the future and you know that your equipment won't malfunctionDO NOT GET THE VIVE!Also they seem to be trying to push past all this negative feedback and sweep in under the rug by promoting the new Vive pro. Don't be fooled by them the Vive pro isn't a fix to the current problems at hand.

So I’ve had this bad boy for a week now. It’s one of the most amazing things I’ve ever purchased!! It was superbly packaged! It was super easy to set up! They send you (almost) every singe thing you need to set this thing up in under an hour.If you have never experienced Vertual reality before then you are in for a super treat! The vive is so emmersive! I found my self knocking knees while “walking the plank” and trying to keep my balance while “hitting a ski jump” or getting some kind of weird vr sickness while doing “360° flips in a submarine”. :DNow! I wanted to point out I had to purchase 2 extra cords for the vive. My computer only has 1 HDMI port and 1 displayport. And the vive only gives you a cable to hook into the HDMI, and my moniter has to use that port(no other option) so I had to buy a DP to MDP cord.  Also the back of the head set has a 3.5 mm headphone jack. This is no real issue bc the Vive comes with some really nice EarPods, but I wanted to use my gaming headset which uses a usb cord. so I had to get a usb cord extender so my headset can reach as far as the vive does.One last point I wanted to point out is anything that hooks into a USB port I had to use usb 3.0, it would not work correctly when I tried to use the usb 2.0 ports.Other then those few hiccups I highly highly recommend getting a vive if you enjoy gaming and have a good computer to run it! 10 stars!!!

I am absolutely stunned by how amazing VR is now that I own an HTC Vive. I had held off thinking that I might wait for the second generation of headsets to come out. I really wish I hadn't waited because the experience in VR on the HTC Vive in a Room Scale environment is beyond description. Watching videos of people playing VG games online pales in comparison to actually strapping it on and wandering around in VR. Don't wait any longer if you are still on the fence about moving into VR.I absolutely love the HTC Vive's quality and feel. The headset is very comfortable and smooth in play. I play for hours and don't have any comfort issues. My wife and son also play and there are no issues switching from user to user (although I do strongly recommend getting the Vive replacement face pads to swap out after a long sweaty game. They are machine washable and well worth it. I got the ones from HTC, (not third-party ones).Setup of the Vive was incredibly simple and before I knew it, I was in my new VR Room (Steam's VR Room). This was very cool and I still love going to the room to look around and play with furniture, decorations and gadgets there. The software installation experiences through Steam have been super simple and there are a number of great games to play with more being added monthly.Mounting the base stations (Lighthouses as they are referred to) was very simple. I set mine up in my basement so it was trivial to screw them into the exposed beams. For other rooms, it should be pretty simple to do. One can mount them into the walls or purchase the tall camera lighting stands to hold the base stations (1/4"" screw base). If you do mount them to the wall, I suggest getting the plastic trim sold at places like Home Depot to put the power cables into so that you don't have black cords dangling down a while wall.My wife and I both agree that it would be hard to go back to playing conventional games on a display after experiencing life in VR on the Vive. I really am looking forward to seeing what Valve (Half-Life and Portal) puts out for VR. Apparently they have three different VR titles due out this year. As they made the Vive along with HTC, you know that they will put out some awesome exclusive titles.Some Suggestions:1) Buy the HTC Vive Deluxe Audio Strap. It's' very comfortable, provides great sound and is very easy to adjust. Well worth the investment.2) Buy some spare face pads. You WILL have others trying it out and you don't want to pass around the headset with wet, smelly face pads.Suggested Games (As of August 2017):The Lab (Free), RawData, Space Pirate Trainer, Brookhaven Experiment, Job Simulator, Google Earth VR (Free), Tilt Brush, Richie's Plank Experience & Vanishing Realms.Update September 01 2017:I am still absolutely loving playing video games again. I find myself looking forward to the end of the day so that I can slip on the Vive and enter new worlds. I have had no problems with the hardware. I really enjoy purchasing through Steam as I can try out a game and return it for a full refund if it isn't something I want to keep.The games continue to amaze me. It's funny when standing in VR, looking over the edge of a building, that you worry about falling over. It's very difficult convincing myself that I will not fall and get hurt (even though I KNOW I am in my basement!) I played a VR flight sim called VTOL VR and love the feeling of flying, being able to look all around myself while controlling the aircraft. I have a few other flight sim titles to try out which are much more realistic and can't wait to play them!Update: March 16 2018 (star rating changed from 5 to 3)I have absolutely loved my Vive! The games.. no, the experience continue to blow my mind and make it so very hard to go back to play conventional games on a flat monitor after experiencing VR. The Vive itself is an amazing platform to use. It is highly accurate for tracking, the view in the headset is great and the controllers work flawlessly.I reduced my star rating from 5 to 3 because of the exceptionally poor customer service. My controllers had an issue and needed to be sent in for repair under warranty. As of today, they have been in HTC's possession for 25 days. They sent me a link to check on the repair status and it has never been updated (it only says that the RMA number was issued). Every time I check with HTC via chat, I get the same story. They have the controllers and are waiting on parts. They ""escalated"" my case and all I got was an email saying that more people know about this but no other details (like an ETA perhaps?). So, because of this horrendous experience, I cannot leave a favorable star rating. I truly do love the Vive but if this is how they treat customers, you are far better off looking elsewhere. I will henceforth start recommending Oculus with the caveat that I do not know what customer experience is to be had from them but it can't possibly be worse than HTC for the Vive.Note: I'm not normally one to complain about customer service from a company and frequently did not worry too much about CS experiences mentioned by others. Having experienced truly crappy customer service, I was compelled to warn others.

The product itself, when it's functional, is fun and works exactly as I expected it would. But that being said I have never bought such an expensive product that is this unreliable in terms of its defectiveness, and most importantly I have never encountered a worse technical support than that for the Vive. The first HTC Vive I bought stopped working after only a couple of days! And because it was discovered to be defective so soon (it was an internal error unrelated to my use of the product) I was suggested by Vive technical support to return the Vive I bought to Amazon for a refund and was assured that this issue was not a common one. So given that information I returned the first Vive I bought and purchased a second one. This one worked flawlessly for 3 months but then one day I noticed the same issue I was having with the first one. I contacted Vive technical support through their live chat (they don't have an option to contact by phone for some reason) and, because it was under warranty, I was told that I need to send in the part that was not functioning correctly to be repaired/replaced. I understood (even though technical support seems to not do any technical support other that telling me to ship items around) and asked for a shipping label. At this point I was more than a little frustrated having this happen to me twice and what was asked of me next sent me over the edge. I was told that I would have to pay for my own shipping label! On a defective product! How cheap does a company have to be to not provide a shipping label for a defective product. On principle I would prefer to not have to send the product to HTC with my own money, but I may have to in order to recoup my investment in this product. And even then that is the tip of the iceberg, the product would need to be shipped there, repaired/replaced, and shipped back successfully. Even then there's no guarantee that it will even last another 3 months!In short if you choose to purchase this product, expect it to be defective, and if it is defective, pray that it happens while you can still get a refund from Amazon, because dealing with the manufacturer is a nightmare.

The HTC Vive Pro Eye system is CURRENTLY NOT CAPABLE OF FOVEATED RENDERING as advertised!! There are demos from their partner Tobii's website that demonstrate eye tracking, which works well, but there DOES NOT EXIST at least ONE DEMO that demonstrates Foveated Rendering in action! I contacted HTC and they confirmed this to me. So, what this implies is that foveated rendering is NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE as it cannot be proven with a technology demo. They are basically using sales from HTC Vive Pro Eye to fund current ON-GOING  research into future foveated rendering implementation. There is probably too much latency for foveated rendering to be feasible at this point... IF YOU WANT FOVEATED RENDERING NOW DO NOT BUY THIS SYSTEM! It will not deliver that capability. If you are interested in eye tracking/ VR integration and do not mind parting with a considerable amount of money for that, go ahead and buy one! It's also worth mentioning, despite their display panels operating at a higher resolution than most on the market, the lenses are sub-par at best compared to even Oculus Rift CV1 lenses! The Oculus Rift lenses have a greater range of clarity compared to the considerably more expensive HTC Vive Pro. Oculus uses a combination spherical and a finely graduated fresnel pattern compared to HTC Vives very coarsely graduated FRESNEL ONLY flat lense. This results in considerable blurriness in the periphery which gives them a very narrow ""sweet spot"" compared to even Oculus Rift CV1! I was very shocked to discover a system in the price range using Cardboard VR lenses... WTF??? You can add to that the terrible customer service... One of the CSRs I spoke to didn't know anything about a recently released product... In my opinion, don't waste your money...

For over a year HTC had not been able to fix the most basic functionality of its VR set: the ability to indicate the charging status of its controllers. There are A LOT of complaints from people on HTC forums, with HTC only be able to say “Blame Valve’s Steam VR”. Well, I didn’t buy the set from Valve. I bought it from HTC, through Amazon. HTC is the manufacturer, HTC is the warranty provider, HTC is responsible for how the set operates.Besides that, the headset has basically no ventilation whatsoever. The lenses produce A LOT of glare, and compounded by lack of ventilation - they also fog up A LOT, making playing games in it a terrible experience.The controllers are very heavy and the shape is such that they just want to slip out of your hands. Playing, say, Beat Saber with these is a constant exercise in frustration. The VR controllers should not require you to constantly making sure you’re holding them very strongly.At this time, I think this kit is severely outdated and overpriced. If you want a good headset - look elsewhere. I’m personally looking forward to getting Valve Index.This HTC kit is worth half of the asking price at best.

Got this after a month-long wait (thanks, COVID!), only for it not to work.  Several hours of troubleshooting and I narrowed it down to the proprietary link cable from the headset to the [pointless] base station.  By the way, these used to interface directly with the PC via standard cabling, but the base station was added with the latest models so they can gouge you to go wireless with bluetooth...using only their overpriced add-ons, of course.As far as trying to get it to work, everything said it was working great, but nothing except a blank, bright screen in the display.  SteamVR would come up as ""running"" and not turn off, with no display on the screen.  The HTC software they try to trick people into installing (note: you don't need to install it at all)  is utter garbage and even caused driver and resource conflicts with Steam.  My computer is no slouch, met or far exceeded all requirements, and I've gotten three other VR systems to work with far less hassle in the past.  I'm not new to this.  I found plenty of videos and write-ups with workarounds on older models that HTC has seen fit to change so you're stuck with their deficient hardware, or I might have taken it apart on day one just to get it functioning.It's simply a defective product, and I should have done some deeper searching for what HTC hasn't crawler-bombed out of search indexes to know that before I bought it.  Everything about it is an insidious cash grab and the sleek exterior hides some shoddy craftsmanship where it really counts.  At least Amazon makes the return easy.  I imagine they do several.

Disclaimer:  I've mainly been using this with games such as Elite:Dangerous, so this review is pretty limited outside of that scope.TL;DR - With Elite I can never go back to using a monitor.  It is simply staggering how one device can so drastically change how you play a game.It's hard to explain, but... it changes your perception of scale and position in the world.  Not only does that make the environments more immersive, it changes the way you perceive the game.  The first time I used it I just sat in an orbital and stared at the interior of the station.  For the first time I could actually see and feel how large the ships and stations are.  It also changed the way I fly.  Maneuvers were easier and I was flying more aggressively and much more accurately because I could interpret my ship's relative position much more readily.It has some major drawbacks, though:Light lettering or objects on a dark background brings out the 'screen door effect' and 'god rays'.The default foam liner is itchy to me.The resolution is noticeably low compared to a monitor.  Aliasing is very noticeable.The lighthouses have to be near an outlet... or use an extension cord, but they're not too difficult to install.The positives:If the content can keep your mind distracted, the 'screen door effect' goes away and resolution/aliasing issues aren't a real problem with most games.The 6mm face foam replacement from VR Cover is easy to install and helps FOV.It's comfortable for relatively long sessions.The tracking is excellent for the HMD and the wands.

Before you buy I would suggest checking out htc vive customer complaints. There are people waiting over 7 months for a controller to be repaired. Myself had a vive 2.0 base station go bad. They said repairs would take less than2 weeks. It's been over a month. The complaints are many. Customer service is like a broken record. They are very polite but have nothing to offer . They promise to escalate the repairs but nothing happens.

This product is shipped with some kind of manufacturer defect.  After only using it for a few months, I now have a ""blinking red light"" with a fault code of 03 on one of the base stations.  This apparently means theres something broken internally and they need it to be sent in for repair.  They want ME to pay for the return shipping so that they can repair their defective product.  I can't recommend this product to anyone anymore.Update 1/14/2019.  They have received my manufactuerer's defective until but now claim their repair center is overworked.  So, I'm looking at an additional month of repair time.  But, when I asked they refuse to update my device warranty for the time their own facility is holding my devices.  So, my controllers, my headset, my other base station (which most likley will have the same manufacturer's defect)  are all ticking down their warrantys while HTC holds my until captive.  They haven't even updated my tracking ticket to show they received my device even tho I specifically asked their chat support to do so.I can't recommend an HTC Vive to anyone.  Don't do it.  I know it is tempting, but the probably of something defective and their terrible customer service is not worth it.

I'm not going to lie. The device is awesome. But holy shit there are so many god damn glaring flaws with the device that makes this a larger money sink than the competition.I'm pretty sure that you can find many glowing reviews about the Vive, and probably none of the cons. So I'm going to go ahead and start listing out the cons so you know the caveats before you buy it!Cons1. The 500 price tag is just the Entry fee. Because trust me... you're going to need more things if you want to use it more regularly or have friends over... or play sessions longer than an hour before it gets uncomfortable.2. The default strap you're given sucks. If you're a larger person with a big head that won't fit most hats at Walmart without having to undo the straps and put them at the last button. Then you're going to have problems. You need to get the back end of that damn strap under the back of your skull. If you don't, then when you try to look down, it will start slipping. Your only option is to tighten it up more, and this gets uncomfortable fast. The Solution? Either mod a welder's helmet strap into it. Or shell out an additional 100 for the Delux strap. The Delux strap is a must have as not only does it make the vive feel lighter. It takes a lot of the weight off your face once you get it right, and it keeps it on the sweet point.3. The Controllers are just AWFUL. So when you first take them into your hand, you realize a few problems. You don't have very many buttons. And most games gives you two options of movement. The first being teleport. The last being direct movement. And... if you use the track pad for direct movement... you will understand pretty quickly how awful this feels when you compare it to the fact that the Occulus has physical control sticks. And sticks out far less. Finally the Grip buttons are incredibly hard to use. Not only is the wand not large enough for larger hands to hold onto them well, but the grip buttons are incredibly stiff making it difficult to hold that button for extended periods of time.  And finally the wands have a huge profile. his doesn't sound bad... unless you have long arms. Then here comes wall damage! The Knuckle controllers are in development. But, given the Wands are nearly 130.... you can bet that it's going to be around that price point or higher for the upgrade. The primary reason I'd buy it is for the control sticks and smaller profile.4. The initial cable you are given isn't terribly long. And you can only buy them from HTC. Your other option is to buy the Wireless Device for an additional 300. But there's a catch. Currently, AMD Ryzen based systems are not having a good time with the device. It causes a large number of problems from just failing to be recognized, to dropping signal, and BSODs. Good thing I didn't buy that yet...I will give it one pro.Because the base stations are wireless. You can actually set up in a different room than your PC. The issue will be the Wireless Reciever if you buy one, as the cable is only 2m, which means you will need to get a longer one, or drill some holes.

Okay, if you haven't experienced virtual reality with an HTC Vive you really just don't know what you are missing.  It is amazing, words fail me when I try to explain just how real it is, and how amazing it is.  It is so real, and so immersive, when playing a game and walking up to a cliff, I feel a fear of falling, it is just that real.  I can't bring myself to step over the edge of a cliff, even though I know I won't fall, I just can't do it.The display is just about perfect.  Some people complain about the resolution, but I don't think there is anything wrong with it.  I am sure you could make it more detailed, but for me it is already amazing.  As for the controls and the interface, they work at real time.  There is no perceivable delay between a movement in the real world, and motion in the game.  The really cool thing is that the game will enhance the controller, adding buttons and information to them, that doesn't exist in reality.  For example, the large round button on the wand, in some games this will turn into 4 buttons, and the battery meter will show up on the bottom of each controller, as with what hand they are, and these things are not really on there.As for the software, since this is partnered with Valve you know that you will never have an issue getting premium games and content.  There is already a number of really cool games, and the system is relatively new.The headset is a little heavy, and when you really get into the game, and you start to sweat the headset will cause you to perspire.  The cable is a bit of an issue.  It is the only thing that breaks the immersion into the virtual reality for me.  I have to keep thinking of the cable so that I don't trip over it, or pull it out of the PC.  But, recently I bought a cable management system that has cables and pulleys, and it made a huge difference.The controls are intuitive, most games don't need any manual, just 30 seconds of a tutorial, and you are playing the game.  Some of the coolest games, like the Lab, are totally free.  Others are paid games, but most of them are totally worth it and really cool.Honestly, if you are on the fence about virtual reality, just go for it.  I thought it was going to be cool, but I had no idea just how amazing this thing was going to be when I ordered it.  It is like Virtual Reality from the movies, you won't believe how incredible it is when you try it.  I just can't tell you how amazing it is, as you won't grasp it without trying.  Yes, it is that good.Unlike some of the other systems, this one allows you to use a 15x15 foot room for your experience.  Walking around and interacting with the virtual world.  This system does not make me nauseus like the other systems do.  It feels totally real, and totally immersed.  In fact, real world feel strange after playing the system too long.  It feels strange to grab something with your hands, after using the wands for a few hours.Pros:  The best, by far, Virtual reality system available.  Room scale, wireless wands, backed by valve.  I really can't describe how amazing it is, I don't have the vocabulary to express it.  Unless you try it, words will just not do it justice.Cons: Compared to the other systems out there, there are none.  But, in a class of its own these are the cons that I have.  The wire, this is an issue that you have to worry about tripping, etc.  It pulls you out slightly from being totally immersed in the game.  However, cable management systems are available on Amazon for very little money, and will pull the cable up over your head, solving the issue.  The headset is a bit heavy, and gets hot when you are using it.Note: I had an issue with the headset not working, turning off mid-game, etc.  Turned out to be the HDMI cable that was included with the system, it was not capable of the power needed to have the thing work, and would shut off.  I switched to display port, and the issue has never come back.  Others buy a much better, high end, HDMI cable, and the issue is resolved.  This is an issue that seems to affect many people.  This is the only issue that I have had, and it was a cable issue, not the Vive, so I won't list it as a CON, even though the cable in question was part of the HTC Vive kit.  This thing is just so amazing, I can't bring myself to ding it with this cable issue.  Just get it, don't think about it, you won't be sorry.  This is the most amazing computer peripheral, feature, etc, that has EVER been made.  This will change gaming forever.  I used to think VR was just in the movies, and was never going to happen, well this changed my mind.  There is no doubt this is the next big thing.  Soon everyone will have VR, it will be as common as a scanner.

My brother and I bought the Vive and after 2 months of use his base station last week started blinking red with an internal error. Then mine did this week. This is a known issue with Vive apparently yet defective products are still being sold. $600 for something that now has to go back to the manufacturer? Save your money and get the Valve Index instead. Updated Review I have now changed my review to a 1 star, HTC has terrible customer support.

Not only did I not get the information I needed I was contacted by a different support person with every new response I sent out. Now I have to PAY to have it shipped to their warehouse?!?

We owned our Vive for 3 months, then It went out. We sent it in to HTC, it took 2 months for them to acknowledge receiving it, once they did, they responded that water damage was the cause and it was outside of warranty.  We never had a spill, and never had the device near water.  The only possible liquid was sweat.  How you create a device you wear on your face and generates heat that cannot handle sweat is beyond me.  They asked for $270 to repair the headset, over half the cost of purchasing a new one.  They eventually knocked the price down to $130, I paid.  When the headset came back it still did not work.  I contacted them, they said to send it back in, and now they want $270 to fix the headset they failed the first time to repair.  So to sum it up, while I loved the Vive while it worked, HTC support is awful.  Its been 6 months since the headset broke, I still don't have it back, and they want a ridiculous amount to fix what they didn't repair the first time around.

I bought my Vive for Christmas 2018. It was great while it lasted which was only about three weeks. Sent it in for repairs, and got a call today 3/26/2019. They said it has water damage, and warranty does not cover the damage. The repair will cost $280. I told the tech that I never spilled water on it ,and that it was only exposed to sweat. He said that is still water damage so it is not covered.  I told them to trash it and not to do the repair.I did some research after this and found two good suggestions to avoid water damage. First wear a sweat band, and second when you store your headset do not let it hang downward on a hook. Make sure the front it it is pointing upwards so that any sweat will run downward and not toward to electronics around the lenses.I think I used the device as intended so I am very dissatisfied with HTC.

At no time could we get either PC to connect to the headset.  Kept getting error Headset not Found.

Both PC's have the required specs to run this properly.We were very disappointed.  My son decided VR isn't that important now after 5 hours of frustration.

My experience with HTC Vive was pretty horribleIt is a great product and is lots of fun to play with while it works; unfortunately, the ones i had lasted about a week. Amazon has provided 2 free replacement (which i appreciate), but it is the same story every time - they worked great at first, but after a week just wouldn't turn on. When the third device broke, i decided to ask for my money back.I suspect the problem might be with the wireless adapter i bought; the first headset i had lasted longer, but died soon after i started using the wireless adapter (which is also an HTC product made specifically for this headset, but sold separately). In my last conversation with HTC support, I mentioned my concerns that the adapter might be faulty, and it is the adapter that keeps frying the headsets, but they did not take them seriously.HTC support has been rather responsive, i never had to wait very long and it felt like they were doing their job thoroughly - each time i was asked to reinstall the drivers, and reconnect the cables, and afterwards given a choice of free repair or asking for replacement from Amazon.Considering my experience, i don't think i will ever buy an HTC product again.

I bought the HTC Vive Pro system for my son for his birthday.  I originally wanted to get him the older one since it was half the price, but most places were out of stock so he wouldn't have it in time for his birthday.  My nephew has the old system, so we have used it many times, so this review is my comparison from the Vive to the Vive Pro.  From the moment you open the box you can see there is a difference in the two systems.  The Vive Pro has been colored blue which I can only guess is to make it look different enough from the original system to make people want to buy it?  The setup is exactly the same for both systems.  They make a very complex system easy to set up by numbering each box.  By going in order opening each box, its pretty much fool proof.  I would warn everyone to make sure before you setup this unit, go into Device Manager in Windows and verify that all your drivers are installed and working (If you see a red x or a yellow exclamation mark, fix this before installing the Vive).  When I attempted to set this up on my son's computer, his USB 3.0 driver wasnt installed.  This caused a lot of issues.  Luckily I have been a computer engineer for almost 20 years, because I can't imagine how a non-technical person would have gotten around this.  The whole setup took about 2 hours to complete (that includes mounting the sensors and hiding the wires inside the walls.  Be sure before you begin to verify your computer far exceeds the minimum requirements.  When I was researching the difference between the Vive & the Vive Pro, they kept mentioning the higher graphics resolution, but I have to say, I don't see much of a difference in the 2 systems.  In fact, in my opinion, the only difference I see in the two systems is the color of the headset and controller and an upgrade in how the headset is constructed.  Knowing what I know now, if presented the opportunity to choose between the Vive and the Vive Pro, I don't think paying the extra money was worth it.  I paid almost $1,500 total (tax included) for the system, whereas you can get the old Vive system for around $800.  I personally don't see enough of a difference in the two systems to warrant that kind of price jump.  I will say that this system is like nothing you have ever seen before.  The VR is so realistic you actually feel like you are somewhere else.  Between the lifelike graphics and the amazing accompanying audio, you will not believe just how realistic this system is.  If you look at the price without trying the system out, the price seems outrageous.  Once you try the VR for yourself, you totally understand why its so expensive.  If you have the money for one of these systems (either the original Vive or the Vive Pro) I recommended purchasing it.  You won't be disappointed.  The VR experience is like nothing you have ever experienced before.

So I've had this for a short time about 3-4 days. When it arrived I plugged everything in and everything turned on fine. I have 3 Vive Trackers and 2 light houses. I set up the light houses how they are recommended I have covered up all reflections in my room and the base stations to the correct channels. (Im using sync cable so A, B). When using the trackers, controllers and HMD. Everything is fine but 1 controller, it has REALLY BAD tracking, before I wrote this review I tried new base stations, moved the other controller where the broken one was losing tracking but it was tracking fine so that ruled out that the light houses aren't seeing the controller and same thing was happening. All drivers, and vive software is up to date. All trackers track fine HMD tracks fine all but 1 controller track fine. So the reason I'm giving 1 star is because 1 controller is Not tracking well. Im hoping I can get a replacement controller or get this one fixed because i need both controllers to work to use the VR.Edit: About a day or two after writing this review Vive got in contact and they sent me a brand new controller and it worked amazing. I’m happy they got on it and were happy to fix things, great customer support/service. I’ve had the vive almost 2 years now, I have never had a problem with it, everything is working amazing and I use it a lot.

Poor Tracking
"
2022-05-23 13:04:20.341930,"
I'm going to review this based on my own admittedly limited experience with VR in general. I've used the PSVR and have tried the Oculus Rift. As far as technical knowledge or ability, I'm somewhere in the middle as far as proficiency. I generally can troubleshoot issues myself without technical support assistance 90% of the time, but I don't necessarily know all of the terminology.To me, the most critical thing to understanding and enjoying virtual reality is not graphical fidelity. It is the accuracy of the tracking capability of the device running at the proper refresh rate. There are games that look like old school, blocky original DOOM games that are as immersive as any game with higher graphical fidelity.So is there a screen door effect? Of course there is. Does it look like the holo-deck on Star Trek? Absolutely not. Is the tracking 100% perfect without any hitches or glitches? Of course not. We're just not there yet and won't be for several more years to come.But right now, the HTC Vive is the king of headsets. PSVR was fun, but tracking was too inconsistent. I grew quickly tired of the camera losing track of my controllers or having to recalibrate it frequently in order to have my hands in the right position in VR. I understand that some find this acceptable. But it breaks the illusion for me.The Vive's base stations are incredibly accurate. It tracks your movements perfectly in the virtual world without any perceptible delay or lag between the input and the movement it creates in VR. You can set up a whole room as a virtual space to walk around in freely if you have the space. The trackers also capture your movement no matter where your hands/controllers are positioned, allowing for a complete 360 degrees of movement without fear of tracking loss. I've tried the Oculus Rift, which is also pretty capable, but in my experience, the Vive tracking is still the clear winner in terms of tracking capability. Once again, imo, this and latency are the two primary factors that will make the most impact on your VR experience.THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN CONSIDERING VIVE:-Awesome device but the cost of entry here is STEEP. As others have stated, you will need a pretty powerful PC to runVR properly. The HTC minimum recommended GPU is a GTX1060, but most users have reported that the GTX1070 or above is the sweet spot. I personally use an RTX2080 and it seems to run pretty well. If you want to go without the wires, you can get the Wireless Adapter, but also very expensive. But man, I can't stress how the tracking on the Vive is clearly superior to other headsets.-Laptop users: You can run the Vive with the right specs, but keep in mind that the separately sold Wireless Adapter requires an open PCle port to function. There is a company called TPCast that has a different solution utilizing a second router. But be aware if you prefer to use hardware from the original manufacturer.-Don't try to jack up all of your graphic settings if you don't have a serious computer. Again, graphical fidelity is secondary to tracking and latency. Trying to push the graphical limits of VR without the appropriate hardware will just create a miserable VR experience and potentially motion sickness due to the frequent lags and hitches. Don't think of it like a desktop PC where graphical fidelity is extremely important. VR, again, is its own thing with its own rules. You must not compare it to traditional pc gaming.-HTC announced a new, upcoming tethered VR headset at the beginning of this year. It may be worth waiting to see what that's about before deciding on this version.VR has finally arrived and it's only going to get better over time. For those unfamiliar with VR, it isn't just about games. There are art programs that let you paint/sculpt on a scale limited only by your mind. There are flying apps that utilize actual cockpits/physics/and cockpit controls. You can literally learn how to fly a plane. The applications for VR go far beyond simply gaming. It is going to change the world one day.Love my Vive but I'm not quite sure that they really need to be that expensive. Which is why I decided to give it 4 stars. The Wireless Adapter is half of the cost of the Vive itself. But if you can manage it in your budget, you will have a VR experience second to none with the Vive.

The ergonomics, link box, cabling, and resolution are great. But the lenses are subpar and are now the worst part of the visuals. The lenses create banding, blur around the periphery, and god rays. I can't wait until I can get aftermarket lenses for this thing to replace them.You also can't change the brightness on the headset except to ""night mode"". I would like something in between. The default brightness is too bright, especially with the god ray problem this thing has. Currently, I just stay in night mode always, but I have to set it by hand every day.The controllers have side buttons that are too easy to press. In games such as shooty-fruity, I constantly press the side buttons accidentally while pulling the trigger. Pressing the side button results in dropping the gun, which is really frustrating. The controllers also still use micro USB for some reason. $120 each seems like too much for these things.Expect to buy your own longer Displayport->minidisplayport and USB Male-to-Male cords unless your play area is directly against the back of your PC.The tracking is usually pretty good, but I had to remove some glass from the play area. Even now, every hour or so there's some kind of blip. What I don't understand is why this can't be detected. Why can't gameplay can't pause and why can't the headset can't go dark when it believes my headset literally teleported under the floor or shot 5 feet to the upper left at 400 mph? The game just keeps going and punishes you while you get a headache.These faults are small enough that 5 stars would be possible if the system were $800 or less, but at $1300, it needs to be better.

We should be able to put negative stars.This product is absolute garbage.  My GF and I both bought systems at the same time.  Identical pc’s and identical HTC ViveFirst of all..  you cannot actually follow the instructions because the vive software allows 3 ways to make an account.  Google, facebook, or SteamNone of them work.. an apology page for facebook, and 500 Server error for google and steam.We managed to get hers to work,  but one of the controllers bricked after the first charge cycle (yellow light stuck on controller.. yes tried all remedies you can think of).During my setup..  all the hardware needed updates.  Headset.. no problem.  First base station.. no problem.  2nd base station....  hung on the update screen that warns you not to breath on it while it updates....  an hour later..  nothingFollowed instructions ...  restarted everything..Bricked..  no base stations detected and nothing will change it.This was an 1100 dollar nightmare.  Not to mention the pc i bought specifically for it.Do NOT buy this trash!  You will regret it.

My girlfriend has wanted one of these since we first tried the demo at the Microsoft store a couple of years ago. I've been both in IT my whole adult life, and a lifelong gamer, but I've never been much for gimmicky things with video games. Never cared much for the Wii, the Kinect, motion controls in general, and so on. I thought this was neat at the demo, but not something I would have expected to ever want.This past weekend, she decided that she had money for the necessary PC upgrades (and make no mistake - this thing takes a beast of a computer to run) and the Vive itself. So $1,300 later, the new computer was built, and we had the Vive. Setup is a little tedious as you have to mount the cameras and make sure they're not too far apart, trace your space with the  remotes, install Steam if you don't have it, the Vive software, et al. Including mounting, hookups, software, and everything else, it took us probably about an hour in total. More if you factor updating drivers and tweaking the GPU a bit to pull the most power out of it.The first night, I let her play with it all night since she was the one that wanted it. But the second day, I took the wheel. The first game I tried was a haunted house type thing that was free in the Vive store...I'm not one to get super scared at stuff like that, but I was genuinely creeped out. I'd see a dark corner, and had no desire to turn it for fear of what would be waiting for me. It was in this game that I made a goof I imagine a lot of people have - to reposition the cables coming from the headset, I attempted to set the controller down on a dresser in the game...and down to the floor it goes. I felt like an idiot for a second, but you can't truly get how immersive this thing is until you try it.Another thing I had fun with was a free to play roller coaster sim. I tried standing while the ride went, and I can't stress this enough - DO NOT DO THAT. Even though I knew it was a game, and even trying to consciously force myself to sit still, I could feel my knees and muscles tense and try to shift my balance as the ride hit turns. I got the sensation of the negative gravity, even though my body wasn't physically moving. At one point, the ride came to a huge drop, and I had to close my eyes and pause the game because I knew I would have fallen otherwise. And I have really good balance. That's how awesome this is.I'd say, at this point, this isn't something your average, every day user is going to deem worth the cost of entry, especially if you don't already have a gaming computer. But if you get a chance to try it, definitely do. It's an experience like no other.

I used it for an hour. It was a glorious hour. The next day I turn on my PC and I get a ""208 error""... The system can't pick up my headset. I research what I can... There are bypass methods people have figured out, in addition to a whole slew of ridiculous steps equivalent to blowing into a Nintendo cartridge and closing the lid *just* right.None of it worked. So, I tried to contact Vive. The only option is to go into a chatroom. I click on the button and it said that I was in a queue with 2 in front of me. Within about two minutes it goes to 1. Yay! This is going quickly! Awesome! **Then it stayed at 1 for 40 minutes** I was losing my mind.When someone finally connects, they OBVIOUSLY don't speak English (""Many thanks for much patience"") they ask me to explain the problem. I do. It takes them ten minutes to respond with one sentence, ""have you tried this?"" Followed by a diagram of the same freaking bypass!! WHY EVEN HAVE THE BOX IF IT ISNT NECESSARY.I explain that I've already tried this method. Another ten minutes pass. I literally ask if there's a phone number I can call because this chat thing is ridiculous and not helping. Over an hour has passed and all I've gotten is one suggestion to bypass the hardware, that I've already stated I've tried. FINALLY I get the response that I should return it because it's defective.Amazing. So I got to use it once for an hour. Yay.

I absolutely love this. Got to try this for the first time with my brother who has this same set. I was open to the new world of gaming and I have to say after 20 years of gaming, the things VR is capable of still leave me breathless. After experiencing it I wished to purchase one so I did. However, the set up I can see might overwhelm some people. Thankfully I have some knowledge of current technology but I can see where others might get frustrated. So consider this a PSA.  For starters, it came with several cords. HDMIs, USBs, and AC adapters. It did NOT come with instructions. However either use of the internet and/or use of common sense, and a little bit of patience, this can be set up no problem. So the first thing you want to do is remove the controllers and the charging cables. (They come with USB AC adapters and there are 2 of them.) Plug them in on the bottom and they should light up that they are charging. Let them charge about 2 hours. Next, there will be a little box inside that should have two plug in sides to it. And they should be marked what side is what. One will connect to the computer and the other to the headset. This will require a power outlet. You’ll plug in the power on the box and connect the usb and HDMI provided into the box and the pc, the hdmi and usb attached to the headset will connect to the box. Just remember, the side that connects to power, is the side that connects to the computer. (This is just with patience and process and elimination.) Next you want to plot out where you are going to be playing this at. You’ll need adequate space. This set comes with 2 sensors that can be neatly attached to the wall or placed. I recommend mounting them (you’ll need screws, 4 to be exact, not included.) NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT: these sensors have to be able to visibly track the headset and the controllers. (Also, you’ll need close plug ins for both sensors. They have to have power, so make sure a wall outlet is close to where you put them.) If they are not, this system will not work. And you will see nothing and think, “oh I have a broken VR, great..” no this isn’t the case. This is probably the trickiest part to it. If you have a Steam account on PC you can go through Steam VR which is free. (not sure if it runs you through this or not after hookup, as I already had a Steam account and Steam VR.) Having this, will walk you through a tutorial on how to get the proper set up. This helped me tremendously as I had trouble getting the headset and controllers to be visible to the two sensors. Now you’ll want to pair the controllers to the PC which again, the Steam VR program is probably the best tool to help. It’ll walk you through a zone and test what kind and size play area for it. Just make sure you have adequate height when placing the sensors. It recommended a 6.5 feet up. After all of that. Maybe simple for some, maybe hair pulling for others, for me it was a little of both. I hope I have or will have helped someone get started with this. It’s great. You feel like your in it. It’s something new to me. Something not stale like normal video games are nowadays. And if you have the money, (which this is reasonably priced compared to some of the headsets out now) the patience, (easy or hard for some) the space, and your ready to take gaming to the next level, then I recommend this to you 100%. This is also great for parties and families alike. Basically a virtual reality Wii. And I really recommend using Steam since they have some free games for VR and some that are very cheap and sometimes on sale. So thank you for reading my one million word review. I hope it helps. Sorry for all the run on sentences. Lol. Enjoy!

I have a Vive and bought this for the added resolution.  The display resolution is better than the Vive, but they really went downhill with the headband and headphone design.  The audio quality is crap - no bass at all.  They are also really bulky and make you look even more dorky than you do wearing a VIve.  I took the earphones off mine and use a Logitech headset instead.  The headband is sort of like the DAS, except its much bulkier, sticks out in the back, is uncomfortable compared to the DAS, and the whole thing is about 6 ounces heavier than the Vive - yes, it is heavier, not lighter than a Vive with the DAS, contrary to what HTC claims.  In addition, the headband does not have the spring loaded feature that the DAS has, so donning and removing the headset is now more difficult.  They only give you one face pad that is ""improved"" but in fact it is stiffer and less comfortable than the ones that come with Vive - took me a long time to break mine in to where it felt reasonably comfortable on my head, and only after applying a lot of velcro at the edges to make it conform to my face.  On the plus side the AMOLED display technology makes bright scenes feel less like you're getting your eyes cooked, and it seems easier on the eyes overall.  Tracking is very good and might actually be better than the Vive, using the standard Vive lighthouses.  The resolution is incrementally better than the Vive and actually makes a difference for applications like X-Plane or Elite Dangerous, but for most games, or just casual VR entertainment, it's not worth the added cost.  My Vive Pro was defective right out of the box and it took me a while to convince HTC to the point they would generate an RMA so I could return it via Amazon.  After some finagling, I was able to get Amazon to ship me the replacement without charging my credit card twice (then getting a refund later).  The one I have now seems to work fine - no issues after several months.  One last thing - it's also not the shade of blue that it appears to be in the photos - it's almost black.

First, let me talk about the problem of VR which is not specific to this platform gut affects all. There are not yet a wide offering of games for VR. There are some demos, such as Valve's ""The Lab"" which scratch the surface and show how wonderful the platform would be.... if only there were AAA studios embracing it. There are some re-releases of past AAA hits like Fallout 4, where you get to re-pay $60 for a game you already played, only to be initially impressed with the immersion but ultimately find out that you just can't be in VR headset for hours. Hold that thought and I will come back to it.To be fair there are some games that are worth playing. Arizona Sunshine is a very good game and does a decent job with VR, and if zombie shootup is what you like then this is good news for you. Superhot VR is great in that it really draws you in and forces you to be physically active, but the graphics are very primitive. Likewise of Rec Room.The problem is that VR requires a much higher frame rate than traditional gaming. The experts have found that if the frame rate ina  VR game drops below 90fps, the effect it has on the player is very significant. IT causes disorientation, light-headedness, headaches, and nausea. Herein lies the problem that keeps VR from really taking off.In order to get a good VR experience and not get physically ill, games have to keep the frame rate up above 100fps, and the majority of video cards cannot do that for games that give a large open-world with a lot of action. This is why the graphics in VR games look so old and primitive -- because low poly works well across the spectrum of video cards out there. And even if you have the latest flagship GPU -- which costs about as much as the VR headset does --  you will still be playing low poly VR games because you are in the minority and the industry has to develop to a much lower hardware standard in order to make the revenue they need.Now, back to my statement that you can't be in this VR headset for hours. The reason is that it is heavy, uncomfortable, and the display is quite poor. The display is blurry and pixelated. If you have the headset adjusted right, when you put it on you can find the sweet spot where it isn't too blurry. But if you try to really game in this, it takes about 5 minutes for the thing to shift and you can't really see jack.Trust me, I wanted to love this product. There are 3 gamers and rigs in the house and this was to be very memorable Christmas in 2017. I cleared out an entire room to dedicate to this and bought cabling and extenders, and run cabling in the walls, so that all 3 rigs could be used where they already sit -- and not have to move a rig and dedicate to VR. I upgraded GPU's. I tested and tweaked everything. I bought the audio headset. I even setup Steam Link to mirror video and sound to the living room TV so the spectators could see and hear what the player was seeing and doing.Christmas day was fun. We spent most of our time in ""The Lab"" and it was great.  The archery minigame was really fun and we spent hours taking turns on that. It was fun to play fetch with the dog. I bought ""Arizona Sunshine"" for the kids because they really like zombie shooters, but neither latched onto that.After Christmas day, the VR set began collecting dust. My son tried to play it but just couldn't be in the headset for any period of time. I also tried and couldn't really get attached to it. We remained hopeful that more content would come out, but there really hasn't been huge movement. Now a year later, I blew off the dust only find still, the leading games are Arizona Sunshine, Google Earth, The Lab, Superhot VR, and Rec Room.Google Earth is really great. Google Tilt Brush is great. Youtube VR is pretty good. But there won't be a Fortnite VR anytime soon because low to mid-range rigs wouldn't be able to keep the frame rate up over 100, and even if that is not an obstacle the comfort and poor display become the blockers.Apparently HTC has now come out with the ""Pro"" model, which improves comfort and increases the display resolution. That sounds like good stuff, but sorry I am not paying again because even if the comfort and display are acceptable,  the lack of content remains a huge problem.Anytime I go to purchase a piece of technology on Amazon, I always get the option to obtain the time for less by trading in things I already have. I can get $60 for a steering wheel that is 2 years old, or $56 for a TrackIR system that is 3 years old. But I can't get anything for this HTC Vive VR System.  But I can't get a penny for trading in this HTC Vive VR System..... even if I wanted to get the ""Pro"" version, I can't get a penny by trading in this version.So no, I am not going to shell out another $1,400 to see if the Pro system is much of an improvement and to sit and hope again that killer titles will come.

Red LED on headset, controllers will not pair. I spent over an hour with tech support on day one. The FIRST thing they did was get a system report, that identified ALL my hardware. After this hour, I sent back the device for replacement, believing it was defective. The next device had the same issues. So I went back on with tech support that insisted I re-do every test we did two days prior, and needed pictures to make sure I didn't plug it in wrong. After another TWO AND A HALF hours of troubleshooting, they tell me that my RTX 2060 is not supported and give up. They support RTX 1060 AND BETTER, but not a 2060?? Does Nvidia know the official stance of HTC VIVE is that it does not work with their RTX 2X series cards?

It was great for the first 2 months.Then the controller's D-pad stopped working in one of the directions; apparently a very common defect.  I sent the controller in for warranty repair; it arrived at their facility on March 1st 2018.  I was told it would take 2-3 weeks to repair. As of writing this review, it's been over 2 months and no repair.  I have contacted HTC support multiple times over the past couple months.  Every time I'm told that it will get repaired soon.If I ever get the controller back, I'll update this review accordingly.  As of right now I would NOT recommend the Vive, or any HTC product, to anyone based on their terrible customer support.

Wow, where to begin. I had originally purchased the Oculus Rift before realizing it was about to be replaced by the Rift S. There was a technical issue with the Rift display, so I returned it and purchased the HTC Vive. I was excited, because it was more money, and well, I figured if it costs more, it must be better than the Rift. Not so, not even in the same ballpark.The Vive  arrived in a nice box, packaged well. First impressions upon opening it was a tad overwhelming. Compared to the Rift, this had many more parts and pieces. As I took everything out, I soon realized that I either A: Had to buy at an additional charge, stands for the 2 sensors, or B: Mount the sensors on my wall with the included hardware. Keep in mind, I am not handy and I rent my house. Drilling holes (1/4 inch as the directions say) in my wall was the last thing I wanted to do. I went ahead and drilled my walls and mounted the sensors as described. Each sensor has it's own power cable, so you plug those in after mounting.The Vive has a box, sort of like a middle man, between the headset and the computer. So, you take those 3 additional cables (2 USB and 1 HDMI PLUS another power cable) and plug them into the box and connect the other ends to the PC. Then you take another 3 cables from the headset and plug them into the box, so you kind of have this chain of cables all over the place. If you are like me and hate cables, it is really a bad setup. If you have this near your entertainment stand, or in your room, it's just more cables to have to deal with, not good. It's a considerable amount of extra wires.Next was setting the controllers, room and headset up. The controllers are large, long, cumbersome and awkward. Compared to the Oculus Rift, they are not nearly as intuitive and more easy to drop, throw and are otherwise quite clumsy to handle. Keep in mind, I am 6'5"" and 270lbs, am a big guy with bug hands and I found them to be way too bulky and clumsy to handle.Ok, so the room boundaries are set, the controllers are set and now it's time for the headset. The first thing I noticed was it has NO headphones. I was wondering what the extra cord was on the top of the headset, and sure enough it was a headphone jack. So, I entertained the setup and plugged in some headphones. Keep in mind, it was yet another wire to deal with dangling from the top of my head and the comfort of adding an additional headset and wire to the top of the Vive was not comfortable at all. I'd be focusing a lot on those wires and not my VR experience. The Rift's wires are far less, the sensors come mounted on their own mount, no drilling or extra purchases are necessary and the Rift has good sounding headphones built in, without the need for distracting wires and additional things on your head.First impressions. The Vive headset is a bit more comfortable than the Rift, but that is all the benefit the Vive has over the Rift. The optics themselves are drastically different. The Vive has a beveled or strange circular things in it's lenses. Google them to see the difference.  If you look straight ahead, the vision is clear, if you look around the field of view, the visual image distorts and becomes unclear. I'm sure it's those strange beveled lenses. The Rift has clear and smooth lenses, that do not distort when looking around the field of view.Software. Steam VR vs. Oculus. Steam VR is clumsy with few customizations to your in-environment persona. Clunky handheld tools are needed to interact with your environment in Steam VR and that makes it less engaging and less fun. With the Vive, you cannot articulate your hands and fingers as well as you can with the Rift. Far less attention to detail and fine movement with the Vive is seen right away if you've experienced both Vive and Rift. In Vive, you can customize yourself as a block, or sphere and with some poor choices of hats and other props, there is no human quality to it. In Rift, much greater detail is given to this and you get a mirror that you can customize your human appearance with clothing, hair styles, skin colors, hats, glasses etc. So much better than Vive and you don't need clunky tools to manipulate the world because your controllers are far more intuitive, easier to grasp and can even move individual fingers once you get used to it. Compare Vive to a big fat Mickey Mouse hand, so clumsy and Rift as a regular human hand. They are even displayed this way with the VR space.In conclusion, the visual quality is supposed to be the same, but with the lens difference between the two, the Rift is by far the best choice. Combine that with all the wires of the Vive, the clunky setup of the Vive, lack of headphones and the clumsy in VR experience, the Rift is by far the winner here.Other thoughts: The Vive home environment is far less robust and customizable than the Oculus home environment. If you get a Rift, you can run Oculus and Steam VR, so why would anyone want to limit themselves to just Steam VR with the Vive. This is a review of the original HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, not the Vive Pro or the Rift S.Although the Vive is a slightly more comfortable headset, the adjustment strap on the top of the head is directly under all the wires, including the additional headphone wire. The wires all exit the display on the top center of the headset and move backward toward the back of your head. The adjustment is under all of this and is difficult to adjust without tugging on and interfering with all those wires. Rift is much more well placed and is not difficult to adjust, making it one less thing to distract you during your VR experience.

Yes, the VR experience on the Vive is amazing, and yes it also has it's quirks (both of which I'll leave for others to review.) But if you are considering buying a Vive, you should absolutely do it on Amazon rather than buy direct unless you have your own reasons for doing so.Last week my Vive arrived and worked great out of the box until I upgraded the firmware on the base stations later that day, which bricked the entire unit. (I was not alone in this experience as I discovered in the Vive community forums.) HTC's only suggestion on Live Chat was to return the whole unit to Amazon (which I was reluctant to do) or wait 7 to 12 days to get a replacement base station sent to me after I sent it back to them first.I figured I would be back up and running more quickly with Amazon, so I packed everything back up and submitted my return request. I don't return things very often, so I was surprised that rather than wait until the bad unit was returned, they sent out a replacement unit immediately. I was back up and running two days later. This one experience has me thinking about doing more of my shopping on Amazon in the future.

I've owned many VR headsets and systems over the past few years, and the Vive pro has to be the only one that's seriously made me question its price. As of current, I have a original Vive, Original Rift, Valve Index, a dell visor that I sold, and now a Vive Pro HMD. It's not all bad, but there's no reason it should be nearly 800$ for the headset alone. Lets get into it.Pros:To start. This headset is very light and comfortable in comparison to some of the other headsets I've owned. The balance of the weight seems to be nicely distributed across the skull, while fitting snug on the face. I'd say that, depending on who you asked, it's as comfortable or even more comfortable then the index. It's lighter then the index, and better balanced. A definite improvement in that regard.Additionally, the display is much better then the original Vive's. It's not perfect, and it definitely still has a screen door effect, but not nearly as blatant as older headsets like the Rift and Vive.Microphone is also a great improvement. It's still not the best out of all the headsets I own, but it's much better than the Rift and Vive.Cons:Unfortunately there's quite a few cons I have for this headset. The first major one I noticed was the earphones. They're TERRIBLE. For the price and size of the earmuffs, this is simply an unacceptable quality of sound for a ""pro"" headset. The Vive's audio strap accessory even blows it completely out of the water, and I'd say that the rift's dinky headphones are about par with this headset. Seeing as the original rift is worth less then half of this headset, I find it extremely frustrating. The audio has almost now low-end and is very ""tinny"".Next is the proprietary cable. This isn't a show stopper... but the fact that I had to buy a 60$ accessory pack to attach my wireless module to the already 800$ new headset is insane in my opinion. Seems like a very large anti-consumer move from HTC. The link box is fine though, and the length of the cable is adequate, but the same accessory pack for the Cosmos is cheaper AND comes with a spare battery with the same cable...My last major gripe with this headset is the lens they chose. It seems that they decided to just use the same lenses from the original vive. Godrays and glare are just as bad or even seemingly worse then the vive, and that's just unacceptable for a headset of this caliper. Additionally, the IPD adjustment doesn't allow for tighter adjustment then 61.5mm, while it's advertised as a range from 60-73mm just like the original viveOverall:In all honesty, if I didn't need this headset to keep wireless adapter and upgrade to the 2.0 base stations, then I'd say to avoid it at all cost. Weigh your options with other headsets. It's way overpriced for what it is, and with better options on the market like Index and Pimax, it's not justifiable. If you already own a vive, then just keep it... this isn't much of an improvement in any way other then slightly improved pixel density and microphone quality. I got this headset for 500$, so 300$ cheaper then MSRP, and it's still not worth that in value. It should be a 400$ package for just the HMD, and maybe 700-800$ for the full kit it to really be worth it. Anything more and it's beat by better options for better prices.Thanks for coming to my TED talk

Bought this for my sons for christmas 3ys ago. Just now reviewing, not technical,  as a present. They we really excited to get this thing! We have gone through 3 headset cables, and a new hand controllers from Valve called knuckles. They have a good desktop to run it through and I believe its one of the reasons my oldest son is now going into computer science. I used to think it was a game now i see its part of the future. I have tried it and sat in gardens in japan and had butterflies land on my finger. I tried to fly some space craft, but i found out flying makes me sick! I am dumbfounded. But they get it so...maybe someday i may have a conversation with my great, great, great grandchildren. In a garden. On Mars!

I'm running the Pro with wireless kit, and have my base stations on a pole and basically they NEVER get moved, touched, hit etc. After a few months, a base station will 'die', which is indicated by a blinking red light. It is a hardware failure, and online vive support says send it in. Apparently, there numerous reports that sending it in is a dead end. So that means I have to buy a new base station which is $130-$200. Just bought my second replacement unit. Absolutely egregious. Shameful. Be warned, do your own homework on this, search forums etc.

1. As an OrderI purchased from VRPark fulfilled by amazon and I Bought the (Original) VIVE Kit and my main concern was equipment condition and if it would include everything. My purchase had nothing missing, appears new, and included the base station mounts as well which was my main concern.2. as an ItemAfter watching VR let's Plays, I was kinda a hater, didnt see the immersion. Now actually doing it is completely different. I tried it out the first time, and I got completely immersed. Feels so real. SuperhotVR is so amazing. In other games like FalloutVR, My brain is doing something my body wasn't when running in game. I took some ginger and some Dramamine and that helped my motion sickness symptoms; but now after using it a few days I'm completely adjusted, and all I get is a headache from eye strain from using it for multiple hours because its so addicting. Also, NPCs creep me out and still not used to it. best purchase I've ever made

I was told my Vive headset was out of warranty (purchased Nov 2016) and I would have to pay for what is basically the price of a new Vive. I have done my best to keep it maintained after use and it suddenly stopped functioning a few days ago. I spent about 3 hours with customer service troubleshooting this thing and they told me I would have to ship it to their repair center with my own money and then pay for the repair which they estimated was about $270 which does not include shipping costs. After doing some research, it seems that this is happening to a lot of people and are pointing out a flaw where sweat can mess up the electronics. As someone who is part of the Armed Forces, I am very active and the Vive was the best purchase I have made since it both keeps me active and entertained. My friends loved to play with it. Some even considered buying their own Vive for their own use and I was even going to suggest to my commander to purchase a few for our recreation center. Considering this design flaw and the fact that it stopped working right after my warranty expired on top of the terrible customer service from HTC, I do not want to recommend this product to my fellow service members or anyone else who is considering the VR experience.Update: After talking to HTC's Service Reps again they recommended that I have the option of purchasing the Vive Pro headset. Not only is the repair price they gave me the cost of a new VR set they have the audacity to tell me I can purchase their more expensive headset! Is this seriously how they treat their customers?

I purchased this product for my son for Christmas. He absolutely loved it. His best friend also got the same system. We cleared out a room to set up the ""virtual area"". Within 2 months his best friends system was not working so he sent it back for repair. The manufacturer said there was ""water damage"" and refused to repair under warranty. Now my sons system has stopped working after meticulous care. I sent it back to the manufacturer for repair. I got the same response in less than 6 months of use this product can NOT withstand normal sweat from playing the virtual games therefore it is an INFERIOR PRODUCT!

Okay. So here it is.  I am a big VR enthusiast.  I have had 4 Oculus Rifts, 3- Samsung Gear VRs, etc.  I have been waiting, waiting and waiting some more (like 2 years) for a new game-changing VR headset to come out.  When I saw the Vive Pro Eye, I about lost it.  What does it matter if it's $1600+ if I can actually jump into a new reality and feel like I'm really there?! Right?  So I bought it.  Man, am I disappointed.  Just shipped it back as quick as I could.  The FOV was real small, it seamed like I was looking at everything through a tunnel.  There was obvious blurring along the sides of my vision/the screen, and the headset felt awkward, clumsy and unnatural.  If you already have a VR headset (Oculus or Vive) keep it - DO NOT GET THIS HEADSET!  I guess we will have to keep waiting.  Now about the seller - Aventis Systems.  It appears they have a 15% restocking fee - WOW. It appears that I will be out $250 for this overall bad experience.

Base station began blinking red two months into use. Looked up the issue and was told to use the rescue files in the SteamVR directory and it flipped back to green, I assumed the problem was resolved then.Today was changing up my setup of the base stations in my bedroom and noticed that inside VR the base station was still in it's old position. Which I thought was odd.Decided to test it out by itself, and yep, zero tracking at all. My single base station had apparently been doing the lions share of the work while the other one was utterly broken, even after the light on it was giving me the all clear.Was told my warranty was up so I either have to suck it up and pay 90 dollars and a month of my time to get it fixed, or 134.99 to buy a new one.Overall very unhappy.

The company does not support the USA. They offer other countries things that we are unable to get, and when we have trouble, they say we have to pay to play. The customer support is in Columbia, the country. They just keep reading off the script that they were given. The Vive Pro is a bad investment. HTC does not make good phones either. I suggest you find a product that you can actually use instead of constantly having to repair it.

I waited for a year and saved up enough gift cards to buy this just for it to never work.  After hours of trying to fix whatever was causing the vive to give me errors saying that the headset isn't connected I gave up and tried contacting vive support.  They were less than helpful as after waiting 2 weeks for a response to my email I only ever received an email saying they got my support request and would get back to me as soon as possible.  I even tried their chat but it was closed every time, even though it was supposed to be during the hours it says they are available, but they were not. It's now been over 3 weeks and have still gotten no response.  I decided after waiting just over 2 weeks to just return the vive for a refund.  HTC's support is a joke and I am going to look more into the oculus rift, at least it is cheaper and hopefully they have better customer support than Vive, I don't think it could possibly be worse.

Did not come with adapter needed for me to setup. If you use the HDMI port for your monitor, You must have 2 HDMI ports on you graphics card for this to work out of the box. Also the ""free"" bundle that comes with this requires you to sign up for a monthly subscription. So me and my son were very dissapointed when we opened this on Christmas and could not play.Update.

At first I had buyers remorse because I spent nearly 2k on this vr setup (not including the computer). I also got the wireless adaptor for this headset and it hooked up easily. The instructions are so ""simple"" that I almost couldn't figure them out. After about an hour of setting everything up. I ended up with the trackers being on opposite sides of my room. So that it could get a 360 coverage better. Also o e thing to note is that mirrors of any kind need to either be removed or covered with something because it causes the tracking to go nutz. I then got all my games from steam. And fired up there steam vr client app. Witch brings you to a room so you can pop in and out of any vr game. So far this headset has been perfect. I have almost 14 hours in it. Since I have the wireless setup, it needs a battery pack to power it. The one HTC provides is something around 20wh witch will not last for more than 3-4 hours of play time. I already have a 100wh battery bank but I soon realized it would not work because it doesn't have quick charger 3.0. For some reason qc 3.0 only works with the headset. I will update this review if anything comes up. So far it's been the best experience ever!

For entry level, this is a fantastic option for VR with ability to scale upwards in hardware. I would recommend a after market headset or earbuds. The stock ones work, but I found myself refreshing the position in my ears quite often. The resolution is sharp near by and far off. However midrange can be somewhat pixelated, IE similar to the distance around the drivers seat to the dash in a vehicle to the hood. This isn't really a huge issue though for most purposes. Room inside the headset can be tight for certain types of wider prescription eyewear, but most shouldn't be a problem. Though I personally use insert optics for in-VR prescription lenses correction. Software runs pretty well, as long as your hardware is fairly up to date for your Desktop system. VR Chat, FS 2020, and several others run with no issues.

I have watched VR videos on youtube for years and have always wanted to try it, and only now that I just turned 19 do I finally have enough of my own money to buy both the best VR headset on the market, and the best gaming computer on the market, with an RTX 2080ti, i7-8700k, Water Cooling, 32GBs of DDR4 RAM, and RGB lighting to top it off. All my VR games always run at max settings at over 60FPS with no stuttering.Besides my gaming PC, on the HTC Vive side of things, it really blew away my expectations.The two magnified eye glasses take up over 90% of my vision to the point where I honestly feel like I am in the gaming world! I remember that after setting everything up with the official HTC setup program, It took me into a vr hub for steam, which appeared to be the living area of a million dollar log mansion that was as real as life itself! Everything looked so smooth and incredibly detailed! The clarity is very clean, very smooth, the headset is very comfy, comes with comfy noise canceling earbuds that have a built in mic, the tracking of the controllers and my vision is so fast and precise that all my moves are instant and expressive, there is no lag whatsoever so I don't get motion sickness.Speaking of motion sickness,I underestimated how much I would be looking around in all my FPS and Casual games, I would end up turning around in one direction for too long and the cord for the headset would wrap me up like a mummy! And some of these FPS games move so fast that my body would feel like as if it was moving aswell and I would lose my balance a bit, but that taught me to slow down. Besides the small cons, In all honesty, the whole experience is insane and too breathtaking for me to be able to describe, you simply have to try it for your self and you too will be blown away. I'd very much recommend all gamers to buy this, especially if you want something new after feeling burnt out on your usual dozen games you play. I'd recommend to also get the wireless adapter, for only a few hundred more bucks you get total freedom without that mummy effect I was talking about, I'll be getting that very soon, I just blew my check on the VR headset and the last three months of my earnings on the pc lol. Oh also, the whole setup process is a bit of a task in itself lol, took me like an hour to take everything out, plug everything in, install the firmware, and get the vr system configured, but the experience is well worth it. Also as a fair warning, YOU WILL GET TIRED FAST! I played for barely two hours and was exhausted but yet so satisfied with the whole experience, a good weight loss routine to be honest! Also you don't need very much room to enjoy this, just so long as you can have enough room so you can hold your arms in all directions with a bit of leaning room aswell, you will be good. You can enjoy this standing up or sitting, but I'd very much recommend standing to be able to really feel like you're there. The benefits outway the cons 10:1, which is why the 5 stars stand. Slightly pricey for the average person sure, but there are unlimited experiences to explore.

2 broken controller track pads right off the bat and 3 busted 3-in-1 cables later, the headset itself finally broke due to ""sweat damage"". HTC could have avoided most of these issues simply by adding some extra glue under the controller pad and waterproofing the pcb but i digress...All in all I would say I got about 100 hours of game time out of it over the course off all these part failuers. The lighthouse tracking system works great, and it was the best gaming experience i have ever had, BUT- buyer be warned... anything beyond occasional use will render every part of this thing a brick.

When the HTC Vive is in working order, it's really cool.  First, the base station adapter failed and I bought a new one after two long and irritating attempts to get HTC to send a new one.  Next, the right click on the controller's track pad failed.  Again, I bought a new one after giving up on HTC support.  Now, my HDMI 3 way cable has a short and my return period has ended.  If you google these issues, they are all very common, known issues with HTC products.  I've played mine less than 100 hours.Save yourself the trouble and buy an Oculus.

My son worked his tail off in school all year with the ultimate goal for him to earn his dream technology, an HTC Vive.  Last year, we built a gaming computer.  A great computer that we put lots of thought and money into making sure was top quality and VR ready.  So, the big day comes, his report card shows he has done amazingly well!  So, off we go to buy an HTC Vive.  First, apparently you can't buy it anywhere at a store.  You can only order it online.  Not in Best Buy, not in Microsoft Store, not anywhere within 200 miles of us except possibly New York City.  So, deflated, we resign ourselves to ordering it online.  Two days later, it arrives and everybody is so excited!  He plugs it all in... and... crickets.  The thing doesn't work.  I spend 5 hours reinstalling drivers, plugging it into different USB ports, restarting the computer, etc, etc, etc.  After hours, I determine it must be the graphics card.  Now mind you, the card we had wasn't top of the line, but it was certainly VR capable.  Nonetheless, I said why not, he earned his technology, let's buy an upgraded graphics card.  Of course, to get a decent one, its either online or New York.  We didn't want to wait for shipping again, so, in the car we piled on a Saturday morning and rive 3 hours one way to Brooklyn to Micro Center.  Get a top quality new card that the techs assure us will work.  Get home at 9 at night, install the card, and.... yep, you guess it.... crickets.  Okay, I say, must be a defective device.  So, I send it back.  Amazon was great in this regard, they sent us another one right away.  So, two days later, new Vive arrives.  Big excitement, everybody's pumped, no way it won't work this time, right?  RIGHT?  Ummm, yeah, still a negatory ghost rider.  So, he went with an Occulus and now he's happy.  I'm happy, everybody's happy.  Friend's don't let friend's buy HTC Vive's.  Just get what works, save yourself the frustration.

Was on the fence for a while due to the reviews suggesting this headset is not worth the upgrade but eventually decided to try it out.I had the original Vive for two years, I upgraded the original strap and I loved using it, but was hoping for a better picture quality as well as an upgrade in comfort. the Vive pro headset only is obviously not cheap, but it delivers on image quality and comfort in a big way. it made me enthusiastic about using VR again, being able to stay in it for longer periods and enjoying the experience on almost every level.It took me about 15 minutes to connect, download, install and pair with my existing controllers and sensors and it's just an amazing VR system. the only downside for me is the headphones, they are not terrible but they are not worthy of the Vive pro experience.All in all, it's fantastic upgrade, you will still not be able to watch movies comfortably in it, but it will make your older VR set feel as a thing of the past.If you are looking to upgrade or looking to start with VR, I think you should no longer consider the classic set, which was amazing when it came out, but not even close to what this new generation experience has to offer. it's like suggesting to buy a standard definition TV when HD is widely available.

In case you were wondering, Half-Life: Alyx is not included. (Btw: running a core i5 9400f with an RTX 2070, and 16gb of ram)I've only had this headset for two weeks, so keep that in mind, and it's my first VR headset ever.I don't believe HLA makes a VR Headset worth it at the moment. The included controllers makes locomotion awkward because touch pads does not equal the tactile feel of a joy stick. Makes moving feel like riding a skateboard. Just teleport when you can, or get the Index controllers.That being said: HLA is a great game and was an awesome experience. Completely spoiled all other VR for me.As for motion sickness: I rarely felt motion sick, I could game for hours in this headset. It only occurred when there was a sudden drop in frame rate (which mostly occurred in loading screens)90 fps is good enough for me. The breakaway box has only caused me problems once. The cable that runs out the back of the headset and is only a slight annoyance.The included headphones are great, I wouldn't suggest removing them because a full, over ear headset would just be awkward. I don't think the headset would accommodate them very well. If you must stop using them, use ear buds.Room scale was easy enough, just make sure you keep your base stations steady. They don't NEED to be facing down at a 30° angle, however, they can be easily disturbed if something tugs on the cable.Steam VR still isn't perfect and I get an annoying glitch where I get no audio unless I restart steam.Lastly, don't punch your monitor by accident.----------------------------------------------- 1 year Later -------------------------------------------------------------I still enjoy this headset, though I did have to replace one of the lighthouses, but htc was kind enough to replace it for free. The headset still works as advertised, however I can no longer recommend this headset as there are superior and cheaper alternatives out there (like the Oculus Quest 2). I definitely feel buyers remorse, but until I have a good reason to replace this headset, I am going to stick with it because it's adequate.

First off..  I've been playing video games since the 80's and have had all pretty well all the systems through the years from Nintendo, Sega, Sony, Microsoft etc.  But have always found myself to be a PC gamer at heart primarily because it being where the most innovation takes place. Until around 10 years ago that is. It seems for the past decade there has been little to no technological improvements in gaming to speak of instead developers have adopted a ""rinse, lather, repeat"" approach to games and rolling out with sinple retextured versions of last years games that make them feel more like an expansion than a sequel.  When I very first heard about the Vive I was skeptical and convinced myself it had to be a gimmick similar to 3D. And I believed this because it seems passion in the industry had long been left behind.  But this wasn't the case.Well I finally decided to give this a go and bought one here at Amazon and from the first moment I got it set up ""which was pretty easy and straightforward"" and put it on my head my jaw dropped.. My palms became sweaty.. My heart rate began to accelerate.  Because in that moment I knew it wasn't hype..  It was real.. The technology I've waited a lifetime for is finally here and I can't even begin to describe how amazing it is. It simply has to be experienced to be believed. Don't try cell phone VR or PSVR believing you're getting the real experience because they are only ""kind of like VR""  the Vive truly is VR and it's the coolest thing you're going to experience in relation to gaming.  I truly hope it's here to stay and continues to be developed and supported because it really is the evolution in gaming immersion we've all been waiting for.  If you're a tech enthusiast or a long time PC gamer who is jaded by all the years of games not making any real progress then this is for you. Step into the world that is the Vive and be amazed. Can't wait until Fallout VR comes out this fall.

I kept going back and forth with my husband on which VR to get. We chose this one mostly because it was the only one available at the time, but also because we looked it up on YouTube and a lot of people were recommending it.It took a little longer than expected to receive this item, probably because of COVID-19. However, we received it still in reasonable timing, and we have no regrets. Yes, it's a little pricey.. especially when you can go get the Oculus or the PSVR for way less. But let me say this, you get what you pay for in VR. Meaning, the quality is so much better in the HTC Vive than the Oculus or PS VR. I can say this because I have both. The game options are endless on PC versus the PlayStation. The controllers on the HTC Vive are comfortable and very responsive. It comes with two base stations, and when you're setting up the VR it asks you to set boundaries. Basically what it wants you to do is to take a controller and walk around the room to let it know when to inform you that you're too close to something. So say you walk into a square, and you put the headset on... If you walk too close to your refrigerator, there will be a wall that shows up in the VR to let you know not to go past that point or you're going to run into something. Lol unfortunately, there's no way for it to know where the ceiling is so be careful on that. If you have the option, I recommend a room with high ceilings, as my husband has already destroyed a light fixture while playing Beatsaber. LolThe only complaint with the HTC Vive is when you want to add add-ons. That's when it becomes a little bit more tricky and frustrating. For example, the wireless option... The HTC Vive has the option for wireless play, by buying a wireless adapter and installing it. Which is actually rather easy to do. However, it doesn't work as expected. So if you're wanting this VR because of the wireless option, just know that it's not very solid. It is beneficial for some games to have wireless, but your sacrificing quality for it. The battery life on the wireless is awful, and it'll occasionally cut out in the middle of your game which will throw you off your balance when you're in the middle of a gunfight and the whole screen goes black. Lol So just keep that in mind when buying VR. If you're buying it for the accessories, definitely look up reviews on said accessories.Other than that, we are very pleased with our VR. As you all know, it is expensive. But I promise you, you're going to have a blast with it. Just make sure before buying it, that you're going to play it enough to be worth the money. The quality itself is worth the money, but what really makes it worth it is how much you use it. Don't buy VR if you're only going to play it a couple times. If that's the case, go to a friend's house who has one.Another thing that I would like to point out is the physical sensation of being in this VR. What I mean is, a lot of VRs, especially when they first came out... Had a bunch of warnings about possible seizures, and other things that could happen because of the VR. For example, losing your balance or getting lightheaded or motion sickness... It happens. But, this VR is by far the most comfortable one that I've worn, and the least likely one to get me sick or to throw me off balance. I have played this VR for about 45 minutes at a time, Max. And I have yet to have any issues with dizziness or nausea, seizures, whatever it is. Where I can't say the same thing about the PSVR or the Oculus. The PSVR, is notorious for making people dizzy and nauseous (motion sickness). Even if you're only playing it for 15 minutes. That is a huge difference in the two VRs. So definitely keep that in mind when you're trying to justify the cost. It's going to be much more comfortable, and you're going to last longer in VR than you would in a cheaper headset.One last thing that I would Life to point out is the quality of the speakers on the headset. Unlike the PSVR, the HTC Vive Pro has speakers built into the headset. You can either have them up and away from your ear so you can hear other people and the game, or you can have them against your ear so that all your hearing is the game. They can get very loud, and they're actually really good quality speakers. You don't need another headset while using this VR. Just use the headset that it comes with, because it's good enough.

Besides trying google cardboard and other mobile phone VRs before. This is my first true VR headset I’ve ever owned. And I’ve decide to go with the Vive over Oculus Rift. After months of researching and  deciding on which to get.At the time. I got the Vive (Fall 2017) because of their price drop from  $899 to $599. So I had to pull the trigger and purchase it. Item arrived fast and orderly. Box is very well presented to me. Everything was packed nicely in its box. It came with everything to get ready.VIVE Headset, Motion controllers, Chargers for controllers, AV Box, Base stations, mounts for stations, Vive stickers, generic earphones, and cleaning cloth.It only took me less then 30 minutes to get it all set up and ready to run.  Of corse I’ve already had the steam client on my PC, due to me playing other games from it. So I skipped a step by signing up to it. Also Vive port is also optional. Doesn’t have to be installed or required for you to use the headset. Setting up the base stations was easy. Also I’ve used a tripod for one of the stations. So I wouldn’t have to hassle to drill a hole in my wall to mount the station. While the other I did mount to wall. Did a few steps of setting up my “ chaperone “ bounds and walla! After fine tuning (setting pref audio and mic, etc) first programs I’ve played was “The Lab and google earth VR” at the time. I was  eligible to get “Fallout 4VR” for free.  Been enjoying it all through 2017-2018. Till I mostly play VRChat and RecRoom on it. Which are social apps. During holidays of 2017. I got myself the  deluxe audio strap. (Also bought here on amazon) and been using my Vive till January 2019. The motion controllers touchpad finally gave up the ghost.  While I was very hesitant to pay $300 for a pair of controllers I’ve realize for the same price. I could buy a whole new VR set from Oculus. So I switched to that.  But I did love my Vive a lot when I used it. Just quality control weren’t there for me, especially when paying $630 after tax.  I still have the product, but given to a family member who does flight sims. Since it’s not necessary to use the touch pads (only triggers) for that kind of program. It was a win and win situation.I will update this review if I decide to want it back or use knuckles. (July 2019; I’m been distracted to my quest and rift VR’s at the moment)

I love VR, and this is the best headset you can get right now, but there are a few negatives I wish I'd known before I made the purchase.On the positive side, the video is definitely a noticeable upgrade over the regular Vive.  The audio is very good, and the headset is very comfortable.On the negative side, the cord is a different design, and is much more difficult to ""uncrimp"", if you play games that have you spinning a lot, the cord will likely become very damaged, need to be untangled more often than on the original Vive, and ""may"" break. (Mine hasn't broken yet, but it looks terrible and I'd imagine it's just a matter of time).The cord cannot be extended after the link box.  It's still long, but definitely a bit more limiting than the original Vive.  While there's a wireless setup, there's an add on required for the Pro that is currently back ordered for at least a month.The headset is also a bit more finicky than the original Vive when it comes to SteamVR.  There are apps that I cannot have open when I try and start SteamVR or it wont work, apps that I can have open with the original Vive (some common examples are Teamviewer, and f.lux), if I do forget to close one of these apps, I need to turn off the power on the Vive Pro link box, and turn it back on before SteamVR will work again.  Hopefully these issues will be fixed someday, but, it's been a problem for 6 months and they still haven't.The base stations have more of an issue with reflections than the original ones, picture frames or windows (even at night) will cause issues if not covered up.I use this headset every day, and I love it, but there's still a lot of work that needs done.

NOTE: At the time writing this, there are already better VR headsets, like the Index, or the Vive Pro. I'll be writing this review as if I'd just gotten it, ignoring the mentioned headsets.I've always wanted VR since my days in college when, at the time, the Oculus DK2 was the only available thing on the market. When I finally got the money to finally buy one, you can only imagine my excitement. The Vive is the superior headset compared to the Oculus, considering its pixel ratio, on top of the better feeling, more ergonomic controllers. This is also better in the sense that, since Valve had a hand in developing this, most of the VR games will be compatible with this vs the Oculus. Having used the DK2 in college, I can say this is the superior headset.The controllers are nice, feel good, and are durable, so if you happen to smack your wall, your controllers will be fine. The charge holds well, depending on the game you're playing, because these also vibrate. The headset is comfortable, and can accompany people who wear glasses with little to no annoyance. The lenses don't fog up when you're playing, and is easily adjustable to fit any size head.My only gripe about everything is that I bought this a week before the Vive Pro was announced. Why this is a bad thing is because the price dropped $100, and couldn't return it, nor get compensation from either HTC, nor Amazon, which is very disappointing.Otherwise, if you're looking for a good VR piece, get this over the Oculus. It's more expensive, but this is one of those cases where you get what you pay for, and you're paying for a much better experience.

I found myself getting bored very quickly with any type of game I purchased the last few years or so. I figured I was getting old and out growing video gaming, which I had done for the last 25 years. I tried my friend's VR and thought it was cool, but the more I thought about it the more I wanted one. I finally ponied up the cash and got the Vive. This thing has renewed my love for gaming again.The immersion is excellent. I was a huge rainbow six fan in the 90s-early 2000's and Onward VR is like playing that (my life is now complete). If you don't want the 'screen door' effect then get a better video card or make the appropriate adjustments to the PD and lens distance. I only see it once and a while but its more noticeable with some games than others. It doesn't bother me though.The front facing camera is clutch to see around your room if you are taking the set off or need to grab a drink or something like that.I've only had it a week so I can't comment on the longevity, but I hope it lasts a long time even with me treating it like fine china when putting it away.

Some googling revealed this is a very common failure for this system.As a design engineer, I fail to comprehend how any electronics manufacturer can field $1000+ systems with a mean time between failure of less than 30 days.Stunningly bad design, manufacturing and/or quality control.

Don't get this product unless you're really able to waste the price for it. There's a good chance this won't work. I got this and set everything up as instructed, and it wouldn't read that the headset was connected. I spent day and night trying to get it fixed, and got no where. I called up the customer service to see if they could help, and they had me on the phone for 3 hours, and it still didn't work. Even better, they actually messed it up even more to the point where the headset wasn't even recognized it was plugged in at all. Consider getting an Oculus Rift, instead of a Vive. It's just as good, easier set up, and I'm pretty sure it's cheaper.

Mind blowing.  It's amazing.  The ability to walk around the room is crazy.  Raw Data is great.  You literally dive to the ground to dodge attacks, hide behind things and pop up to shoot, and crawl on the ground to move from side to side while taking cover.  It's an  unbelievable experience you have to experience.  You can browse this and other applications available on SteamPowered.com.  I thought for sure you would have to remain conscious of your surroundings not to run into things.  You just set a boundary by walking your controller around your space and then a blue fence (you can see through it) appears if you get close to it so you know to stop.  In real life, I don't try to walk through fences so it feels natural.Beyond the ""this is awesome"" part, I wanted to answer some other questions I could not find.  It is possible to watch videos on it that you record yourself.  I bought a Gear 360 camera and have recorded family moments (birthdays, holidays, vacation).  I have to post process the videos with Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate, but once I do I can upload to YouTube or watch on the VIVE.  I simply transfer the video file to the VIVE computer and watch it using Whirligig VR Media Player.  I can view VR photos taken on the Gear 360 too.  I wanted to share this in case someone else was trying to figure out how to do it.I just wish I could figure out how to watch the NBA Finals on it from 2016.  It is available on Oculus, but I can't figure out how to buy it on their store and experience it on VIVE.  Overall, I would definitely buy VIVE over Oculus again.  The ability to move around the room doubles the experience.  If you have used a headset with your cell phone to watch something in VR, you probably thought that was cool.  Trust me, the VIVE takes it to a whole new level.  Wow!

First month was great, even bought the wireless adapter because my friends and I were having so much fun. Turns out there is a bug with AMD CPUs where if u try to use VIVE wireless with a Ryzen it blue screens your PC. They promised a fix but I haven't been able to get it working 3 months later. On top of that the Lighthouse brokea week ago less than 4 months after purchase. Displays a blinking red light which means it needs to be sent back for repair. I had heard it can take upwards of 10 weeks to get anything fixed so I opened a support ticket a few days ago to see how to start the process. Still haven't even gotten an initial response.Love the headset, cannot recommend it to anyone in its current state.

After only a couple weeks, one of the 2.0 Base stations failed with a blinking red light. searching online it turned out that this was a very common issue that many people have. The only way to fix it was to send it in to be repaired.Talked to vive support and its an common issue with the motor. Have to send it in to be repaired.Vive support initially suggested I just return the entire vive pro and buy it again. I guess to hope I get one of the unbroken ones :( I don't want to pack everything up again.  Once I decide to get it fixed, the process was not actually that bad.  Lots of horror stories on the internet, but my repair process was not that bad.I got an HTC Support ticket and had to mail the defective lighthouse to texas ($12 out of my pocket). They say 9-12 days after hey get it they will ship it back.  Mine was repaired in under 2 weeks and has been shipped back to me. Its still in transit, but I have no reason to doubt it will actually be fixed.Support was really good via email. Responsive and polite. Good english, no form letters.I went from 2 to 4 stars.

I received my vive and was super excited to set it up and show it to my family. The hardware it’s self went up decently easy but the software is absolutely awful. I spent 6 hours troubleshooting trying to get it to work. I had updated every driver on my computer with no luck. I talked to two support members on there live chat support page, both were very nice yet were unable to  help me with my problem. I would like to think I’m pretty good with tech as I built my computer and know programming code. I managed to get the initial 8 errors down to one which made it so I could not do the room setup. I researched every page on google, steam, and the vive website but was still unable to find a solution. I love the vive products and think what they do is amazing and wish I could leave a good review but my experience was just horrendous. Others may have different results but for me I am unable to recommend it as a good product and am pretty disappointed.

Right out of the Box, one of the base stations was broken. Then, I signed up for the subscription service, $8.99 a month to play VR games, and was immediately billed TWICE and still couldn't download anything (just kept getting a popup to subscribe again). Steam VR games work somewhat well with this, but some don't work properly, such as Subnautica. I was expecting so much more after upgrading from the Oculus Rift but the Oculus at least worked properly for several years.

I have been a VIVE fan since 2016 and even visited a few VR Cafes. I always loved it. I have to say the shine wears off quick when you have to find games worth playing. The tech is awesome but I just don't see much good content available. Skyrim VR seems like the only full, non-arcade game out there. I am looking forward to No Man's Sky VR but we will have to wait and see. More real games and less arcade games please.The last thing I want to say is holy cow! I consider myself advanced with technology troubleshooting--people call ME for help--but having to do a firmware recovery on day 0? I thought I bricked one of my base stations on its very first firmware update. Luckily I was able to search the forms and discover the fix ""lighthouse_tx_htc_2_0-calibration-rescue-244.bin"" it was even already installed on my computer deep in the folders... Really HTC? Can't you make this easier? Like a recover my bricked base station button? Or menu? Or official guide? I also spent at least 30 minutes battling my right hand because the dumb thing wouldn't turn green. It took me 3 hours to set this thing up and I am no noob.

As far as 1st gen home VR goes, this system is jaw dropping. Sure there are some drawbacks to it such as screen door effect and some god rays in some games, but the incredible feeling of actually BEING THERE is indescribable. I got the headset specifically to play Elite: Dangerous, thinking I wouldn't really be doing a lot of roomscale gaming or experiences, but I find I am using it for lots of great roomscale games and experiences. I am a big shooter fan (CSGO, PUBG, that sort of thing) and after playing VR shooters (Pavlov VR is my current chosen favorite) I find that it is hard to go back to playing pancake shooters. It definitely seems like official support for a lot of non-Valve related games excludes the Vive almost exclusively among the VR headsets, which is a huge bummer being as this is the best headset available right now, but third party applications like ReVive, Vivecraft and more allow full use of most of these. Something I think HTC should have done from the get go is to have included a strap system like is on the Deluxe Audio Strap(DAS), or just include the DAS itself with the initial purchase of the headset. The strap they include is really not very good, and messing around with headphones on top of the headset and all the cables already running to your head... it gets beyond annoying.So overall, definitely room for improvement, but that's what usually comes from first gen hardware. You may find that VR just isn't for you, that strapping a facebox onto your head is not what you want from your gaming experience. You may find that you can't stand the screen door effect (some games are worse than others), you may find that you get motion sick (never has happened to me in the month I've owned it) or get headaches (only has happened once, and I can't say for sure it was VR, might have been anything). But then again, you may be like me and discover that some genres at least are very difficult to go back and play on a flat screen, and the intense gut feelings and immersion that VR provides is a huge thrill. I for one am on board with VR, for it will only get better. AND once WI-GIG comes out, we will have a wireless option for these headsets!

As mentioned in the headline i recieved it and the wires where all tangled up and will no longer go back to how there were originally supposed to be, they will forever curl and twist when I set the headset down, Even when standing they will try to curl and twist and its very annoying, Nothing I've done has fixed it, Think I might go wireless at some point, The headset itself works great, I've had some connection issues but unplugging and replugging it back in works, One of the HTC vive controllers that were shipped with it stopped working a few days after being delivered, It no longer vibrated so playing beat saber or just anything was kinda weird when only one would vibrate, I ended up ordering a new one to replace it, The software needed to install it was hard to find, Went to HTC vive's website but they didn't have the correct installer, Thankfully inside the box had a direct link to the old installer so I was eventually able to play after an hour of trying to figure it out, Also the nose guard inside the headset is broke so if you look down you can see the ground, Not that big of a deal, You can easily just ignore it, Not really noticeable unless you look down at it, Also eventually the straps on the side started coming off after about 3-4 months of using it on and off, Had to get some hot glue to fix it, Which didn't really workOverall 8/10, Wires will forever be messed up and one of the controllers broke but it works and I don't get a headache while using it because my IPD is 74, Which is the reason I got it over any other headset

I'm a professional gamer, and let me tell you: the HTC Vive is often literally unusable. The trackers sometimes drop tracking for 5 seconds at a time, often - like once every 30 seconds often. This makes games unplayable.If you are competitive, the haptic feedback can shut off for 15 seconds+ at a time, again, fairly often, once every minute or so. This makes competing at high levels impossible.The wands are extraordinarily expensive should you need a replacement, and if you want a free replacement, the process takes weeks and costs shipping. It's absurd.Overall a really poor product. Perhaps the Pro version fixes most of these issues - if you're willing to shell out an extra thousand dollars for quality that should be in the standard version.

I'm a millennial through and through. I was born in 1990 and I have watched video games go from the SNES to this. I am also a huge sci-fi and simulator/RTS fan. While there has yet to been a RTS VR game that has really captured me, simulators are where VR shines. If you're like me, you're wondering, ""VR looks cool, but I think I should wait until it's further along before I drop a bunch of money on it"".Well, the Vive has been out for a year, and while the VR genre is still in its experimental stage, there are dozens of games and days worth of content to experience without even spending a penny on software. If you shell out money for a few more paid games, it gets even better. While you'll still be waiting on a big library of AAA titles, Steam is full of amazing experiences, which make for great social/party situations if you mirror the display to a TV so people can watch.If you have the money and the physical space, get the Vive. The room scale experience is so much more immersive than any video game experience I have ever tried, including other VR headsets. My only complaint is that the resolution of VR (this includes all headsets) is a little disappointing. Text can be hard to read and peripheral vision is blurry. However, I think it will be a while before the Vive gets a successor, so it will remain relevant for a while.Live your childhood dreams. Deflect blaster bolts with a lightsaber. Fly a spaceship. Headshot enemies with your bow as you defend your castle. Throw planets into the sun. Scare the s**** out of yourself by falling off a building. It's a blast.

Put about 2k hours on my Pro and I'm left with some very mixed feelings. There has been an overall lack of support for this product by HTC and they have completely suspended production on them. The proprietary cable was an ABSOLUTE mistake. An $80 cable that dies after 400-500 hours of regular use is INSANE. Worse than that the head-strap. Although the halo style band is comfortable and fits to the head very securely it is VERY fragile given the right circumstances. At 800 hours I dropped the headset from chest height onto it's side horizontally and it completely snapped clean. That's not the worst of it however because getting a replacement for the head-strap is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE. These aren't made anymore and any site that was selling replacements have been sold out for well over a year or more. The headphones were really nice, sounded great and very comfortable. Unfortunately I had to remove mine as the leads to the left ear cup were ripped out when I snapped the head-strap. There's no auxiliary out on the headset so I'm forced to run a 3 meter auxiliary cord to get functional headphones and it gets tangled up with the Pro cable constantly. The displays themselves look FANTASTIC and coming from no VR experience to the Pro was really perspective changing. As time has gone on the ""I'm wearing goggles"" tunnel effect has gotten worse and worse and now I can't help but notice it. Wish the FOV was a little wider. Included controllers were okay, and I still give them to first time players to jump them in. Some games are better with the wands but I've since started using the Knuckles, which I prefer. Honestly the only reason I bought into this headset was because the Valve headset was sold out during lock-down. Wish I would have waited as the Index complete kit cost LESS than I paid for the Pro. It also doesn't use a proprietary cable and has a wider FOV. Oh well, I enjoyed the time I spent with mine getting introduced into VR but I should have been a little more patient. If HTC wouldn't have made this thing abandonware well before I bought it I might be a return customer. Fortunately though I've learned my lesson and will probably be buying an Index.

We were so excited to get this for Christmas, but after we set it up we had the dreaded ""gray flash"" problem. It would work for about 5 minutes, and then the gray flashes would start and get worse and worse until it became unusable, within 10 minutes. After leaving it alone for an hour or so, we could use it again, but only for 5-10 minutes. We think some component of it is overheating.I spent hours trying to self-diagnose online, where I learned that many people have this problem and there is no agreed-upon solution, and then I worked with their customer service for hours. At one point, after 2-3 hours talking to customer service, I had to disconnect to do some stuff around the house, and when I came back I had a new customer service person who wanted to start over from the beginning.They eventually decided I had a defective base station, so they had me send that in for repairs, at my own expense and after making me read a bunch of hostile-sounding legalese. I sent it in, and it's been weeks now and I've had zero communications from them, though I know they have my email address because they sent me the legalese that way. I don't know if they've received it, or if they've fixed it, or if they will ever send it back. Even if I someday get the base station back, I have low confidence that it will work, so I suspect the $500 I spent on this system has gone down the tubes.UPDATE: They eventually did send us a new or repaired base station, and we installed it, and our issue is resolved. So I changed this review from 1 star to 3 stars. Getting it to work was a nightmare, but now that it's working we enjoy it a lot.

Okay, so everyone may be like why only 3 stars. The VR experience in itself is amazing. It was easy to set up my system I mounted my base stations on the walls. I was up and running in no time flat. I also got the audio strap but after consideration I may have not gotten that in retro spec because the actual system comes with its own ear buds. I know some people say its heavy on your head but I have yet to experience that, you will sweat a bit if you play for a long time specially the portion of your face that is covered by the headset. the controllers are simple to use just needs a little trial and error then it becomes muscle memory. I rate this 3 stars though because one of my base stations horizontal motors went out. I contacted HTC Vive after reading horror stories online I thought I was in for a heap of issues. Well I did everything they asked on 03/24/2018, they received the device they told me to ship to them on 03/29/2018 as of 05/12/2018 I have been inquiring as to the status of them repairing my device or sending a replacement to me as a trade since I had my product only 1 half months before it stopped registering me and the HTC VIV head set and controllers. Every time I ask them  about my device they say we don't know what's going on with your device we will get back to you later. its's been almost two months now and other than hearing we will get back to you later nothing else has been done. This company has some of the worst customer service I have ever seen in my opinion based on my experience.

I run a VR studio and have worked on every mainstream HMD to date.  From prototypes to consumer retail, I've seen it all.  I only got this device for eye tracking development and was surprised at how janky the setup for eye tracking and face tracking is.  The software is not ready, the HMD has uncomfortable face foam, and the price is insane.  $800 gets you just an HMD.  You still need 2 lighthouse emitters ($200 each) and 2 controllers which are sold individually for a very high price.If you don't need to develop with Eye Tracking, do yourself a favor and get a Valve Index rig.

But there are some issues.My number one issue with this device - and why im taking off a star - is because this device can sometimes just be too complicated for typical people. If you're an enthusiast, a PC gamer, and/or someones who has built gaming PCs before, you'll likely keep loving this device like I have but find yourself occasionally frustrated at some of the hoops it will make you jump through to get it working at 100%. When the games are running and everything is already set-up perfectly beforehand, anyone can just jump into a game and play perfectly fine but its all the initial preparation that gets agitating and sets this apart from the simplicity of things like console/2D gaming.Another issue is that the device - for being strapped on to someone to use for actively moving around in VR spaces - is kind of fragile, honestly. You can check the systems subreddit at /r/vive or even some bad reviews on here and you'll find people talking about how the headset isnt waterproof at all and can be made completely unusable by something like sweat from a long session (like an hour) of Space Pirate Trainer or Arizona Sunshine. And then there's issues with the base stations coming out the box with tracking issues and controllers that stop tracking after one good whack against a wall/ceiling fan/TV because the only thing responsible for the controllers tracking is a tiny little wire ribbon. The worst part about this is that some of it isn't covered under HTC's warranty and replacing a single controller or base station can be $130.But I gave this 4 stars - why? Because every fancy new piece of cool tech has it's issues and risks and their developers tend to handle it with -some- grace in most situations.But, if you're willing to take the risks, you've done your homework, and you know how to handle the device, I absolutely recommend it. VR is amazing with the HTC Vive and the tracking is perfect 1:1 when it's set-up the best way. After trying the Oculus, the Vive, GearVR, Cardboard, etc. I think right now HTC Vive is the winning VR hardware. This is the best step in the right direction to the VR I dreamed of as a kid.When these headsets go wireless with 4K-per-eye screens and can affordably track our entire body 1:1 into VR worlds, I'll know I finally saw some really good VR that always seemed like a sci-fi dream.Lastly, my $850 VR set-up would have, uh...  just been dropped off at my door and left on my porch had I not been sitting outside waiting for it, so, uh... you might want to watch out for that if you don't live in the best area (I don't - that's why I was waiting). I didn't have to sign or anything.UPDATE: After just short of two months, one of my controller trackpads stopped working - despite me usually babying this thing - so yeah, fragile and prone to hardware failures.

htc sales person had my PC specs.  knew exactly what ports i had.  sold me the vive KNOWING i only had 1 hdmi port.  i could connect vive to PC, but could not complete the set up process because i only had 1 hdmi port.  monitor uses hdmi port.  vive and monitor both MUST connected to vid card.  sales person knew this, yet sold me the product any ways.  when i received vive, it did NOT come with an adapter, hdmi to display port.  sales told me it did.  when i connected vive about this, the tech support person told me that the adapter is NO LONGER included!!  because of the nefarious methods used by htc sales, instead of purchasing an adapter, i returned the product for a refund.HTC lost a $550 sale over a $15 part.

I've been a long time gamer. I've invested a lot of money into my computer and I love new tech. I'm very familiar with gaming and I think this item has potential but not much else. Let me tell you why.Cons.  Are you concerned about detail when you play a game? I am. When you put on this headset things will look fuzzy from a distance. I don't know why they chose to only put a low resolution into this, but it lacks in detailed graphics. 1080x1200 per eye, the human eye actually sees 576 megapixels per eye. Maybe the idea here was to make it fuzzy enough to hide the imperfections, so you could pretend you were seeing an object in game.Tracking: I am sure they spent a ton of money on getting this right. And it does work 70% of the time. But when the sensors can't find you, it turns your vision off. You have to stand still and wait while you die in the game, until the sensors pick your position up again.Not many games. There just isn't....Nothing anyone can do to fix that except wait.Pros: WOW! finally virtual reality and its only 2017! Fully immersive! You will feel withdrawal when you take the headset off. You'll feel like you might still be wearing it. Sound spooky? Buy one or try a demo and you'll feel the sensation.Very quick at turning your head and following your body movements (when it can track you). This is so important to the immersion part and the Vive does very well.Can't explain enough how detailed and how immersive this thing is. It's like another dimension! You really feel like you're there...in 1080....,,Note to developers: 3d for TV's didn't take off. This here is the future, but if you wanted to make it truly good up the resolution........1080X1200  SUCKS!

Pretty cool, but didn't care for the fact that I had to immediately unmount the sensor cubes from the wall for a firmware update after just having gotten them installed to the wall.  Also didn't like lacking signs of life in the sensors when performing firmware update...  I mean, you follow the instructions for the firmware update and there is absolutely no signs of life when you plug the power in to initiate the firmware update... not a single glowing LED or anything.  It's a stark contrast to how these sensors light up under normal operation...  leaving you immediately wondering whether the power supply is working...  leading to potential for unplugging in mid firmware flash as you feel the need to diagnose a problem that doesn't really exist.  So, heads up on the lack of apparent life during firmware update of the sensors.  Be patient and watch the update application screen for indication of when the firmware update has completed.Oh, and watch out for the junk drywall anchors that are included.  You get them installed flush to the wall and end up pushing then in when trying to get the screws started into them.  No flange to keep them from pushing in as you apply force to the screw.  Now have two of these drywall anchors lost down inside a wall and had to find a better alternative from the local hardware store.  Didn't even bother trying to use the provided ones on the second sensor install.No problems with operation so far...

Cool Experience, Some Quirky Install/Setup Issues
"
2022-05-23 13:05:22.806854,"
I have been involved with virtual reality for many years owning both the VFX1 and VirtualIO's i-Glasses back in the 90's. I work professionally with VR and currently own all three of the Oculus varieties (DK1, DK2, CV2), a second gen GearVR, Google Day Dream and development edition of Acer's Mixed Reality headset.Based on these products and a comparison of experience, I have to rate the VIVE fairly high in the quality and capabilities. The visual quality and tracking speed of the VIVE is fantastic -- on par with a multi-camera setup for Oculus. The tracking speed of the controllers is also quite good. I did have a few instances where the wands would disappear unexpectedly.  However, again, this is no different than my experience with the Oculus Touch controllers -- occasional tracking glitches are to be expected with a realtime solution.VIVE is definitely a top contender on par with Oculus + Touch. I would be hard pressed to choose one over the other if the decision were 100% based on in-headset experience.The core reasons I'm giving VIVE a 4 star rating rather than a 5 star rating are as follows:1. Wires! So many wires. With the control box, you have at least three wires coming into the box (Power, USB, Video) and three wires coming out of the box to the headset via a multi-cable.  The result is a messy space around your PC where you've got a pile of cables.2. Powered Tracking units. The fact that the trackers require power isn't a major issue, what is annoying is the size of the tracking units power supplies. They are massively tall and long adapters.3. Tracking units have fans? When running the tracking units there is a distinct humming as if a fan has kicked in inside the units. Additionally, there does not appear to be a power button for the units to turn them off when not in use. You have to unplug them!4. The default head strap does little to counter balance the headsets face plate. I acquired the Audio Head Strap and this resolved the balance issue for a much more enjoyable experience (and a bit more contained cable management)Despite these difficulties, the easy of use and software accessibility through both Steam and the VIVE store make this a real contender in the modern home VR space.Video quality, view tracking and visual comfort all get very high marks.

The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because it's still and early generation of this tech.I remember all the way back when I was a teenager in the 90's and the VR tech then was very primitive.  So when I say this is great First Gen VR I have a leg to stand on.  It has the flaws you've read about or heard about but the beautiful visual representation this gives far out weighs them.  I did not buy this when it was $800. That is far too much for something like this.  $499 is way more affordable and practical.  Keep in mind it is new tech and something more efficient maybe down the road and at 499 it leaves room for a GPU upgrade to use it.That being said the Windows Mixed Reality displays are still cheaper and work great with a balance to the drawbacks. the WMR does not need sensors around the room, but the price is the sensors are in the headset and you can't operate in the dark and you have to have the controllers out in front as often as possible so the software can keep good track of the controllers.  Also WMR does not have the same graphics potential as the vive, they do however do not require as powerful a video card as well.  WMR does not require extra power as it is powered solely of  one usb 3.0 where as the VIVE requires an outlet to power it and 2 more outlets to power the sensor stations.All in all the VIVE is incredibly fun and worth the extra dollar if you can afford it. Keep in mind the reason I didn't just add VIVE controllers to my WMR is because by the time I bought both the sensors and 2 controllers I was at $400, might as well get the whole setup.

So first off, I went through 5 of these!. Yes 5! The first 3 that came in we're in a box with no handle, it did not have a narrow facepad, or a sync cable. EVERY SINGLE one of these kits had the glue holding the packaging together loose from storage in the heat AND each one of them 1 or both controller cases came loose and gave the controller a cheap squishy feel. one set had the right audio channel broken and another HAD A BLACK/DEAD PIXEL!After 3 we reorder the item. THEY SEND ME A DIFFERENT KIT! I think it's the new version maybe. Later found out this is the kit ALL previous vive owners have and have no issues with. This kit had all the extras, and all those issues? Non-existant. Unfortunately a random occurance happened to that as well as one of the buttons had started jamming.So I send it in for a replacement, AND THEY SEND ME THE BROKEN KITS AGAIN! I return an item that has bonus items, and the item I got back lacked those items. If you get the box without a handle, just save yourself the hassle and return it now.I gave up and am taking my business elsewhere. BTW customer support online here sucks. You can repeat your issue 10x and they have no idea what they are doing. I had a return last over a week because they screwed up and I had to call for 3 days and speak to about 10 ppl before I could have them understand their error and fix it.

Sure, there are some ways in which this system can be improved (and they are being sold, engineered, and/or produced as I write this review) such as a better head strap, a simple (tiny) fan to keep the inside of the headset aired out while you're wearing it, and of course the ultimate... making it wireless. But all of that aside for the moment, as it is, this is so far beyond anything else I've ever experienced. I was wary of this being a Virtual Boy 2.0, but that is not the case at all. Google's low-cost ""Cardboard"" headset was enough to keep me occupied for awhile, but it was also so enthralling that I wanted more, and the Vive's ""room"" experience totally delivers on that. I can't wait to see the ways in which this setup is further augmented going forward!I have a slightly older card than the min. recommendation (planning to upgrade soon) and I still have an amazing experience with very little and infrequent frame-rate stuttering. Depending on the quality of the app/game, it often feels so real that I've literally dodged, dropped to the ground, and jumped out of the way of things reactively and purely on instinct. ""The Lab"" which is free from Steam for this is so full of amazing games and things to explore that you really don't even need to buy anything extra right off the bat, and even if you did, you could then switch over to the free Google Earth app and spend hours and hours exploring with that!Clearly this is not a headset for the thinnest of budgets, but it is SO worth it if you can afford it. One of my favorite things has been letting other people experience and watching their reactions. That in itself is priceless!

Got the pro set. Clearly depicted as wireless and states it uses HDMI.The thing comes with a wire, and uses a Displayport, not HDMI like they said, unlike other VIVEs.Upgraded my computer so I can use the damn thing, then it randomly stops working after a week. After hours of trouble shoot and reaching out I can't get any help at all.Complete waste, something I would have really loved but ended up costing me far more than a refund could ever reimburse in upgrades, software, and most importantly, my time.I would be interested to see how they intend to fix or compensate me. But they won't, and they won't help you either. Buyer Beware.

After using it for a year, it's still a great HMD. At this point, extra cash would be better spent on a stronger GPU. An exception may be if you have 20/20 or better vision, and so you may be more affected by the screen-door effect & refresh rates (eye strain & nausea).The controllers are great too, but it's not uncommon for the controllers trackpads to develop a dead click on one side. It's fixable with a hole-puncher, a piece of plastic (soda bottle), and a torx T5 screwdriver. It's a pain to do when it happens, but it's doable at least.I've tried the Samsung Odyssey HMD's (both revisions) but even though they have higher resolutions, their HMD's heat up way too much on the face and eyes. And their tracking sucks. It needs brightly lit rooms with walls that have details on them so it can track at least somewhat. But with the Vive you can play all day, as well as in complete darkness, have perfect accurate chaperon boundary lines (so you don't run into walls/break windows), reach behind you with your controllers ( necessary when your game incorporates ""backpack"" or ""backpocket"" mechanics and sword/gun holsters), and it works well with eyeglasses.

So, I finally broke down and bought one of these. There are a lot of pros, the experience is good the sound is good everything is fantastic. My only complaint is if your eyes are not centered precisely when this is on it’s blurry. There are circles that start just outside of the center of the screen and if you’re moving around and the headset slides a little bit things become blurry. That’s frustrating because this thing is not cheap. I could’ve went with a cheaper version of the five or the oculus but believe VR is up-and-coming and an exploding platform. That said, if you’re going to spend the money by the best. So far no real complaints. I have the wireless battery pack and that is definitely not worth it. The pack only lasts about an hour and a half to two hours and there is no warning when it quits. There is only one wire that goes to the computer and quite frankly after playing several different types of games there was really no reason to have the battery pack. You don’t really move around all that much.

It would have been 5-star if only Vive had same optics as Rift. Tracking system is superior, hand controllers slightly less comfortable then Rift controllers , and in general I do not care about devices that do not allow users to replace batteries - be it Lipo or NiMh variety. Rift controllers use simple AA that lasts for weeks, and if you are caught with low battery during a game play, pop a new one in and you are good to go. No recharging, extra cables, checking levels etc.OPTICS: Vive HMD has very narrow ""sweet spot"" as compared to Rift. When looking straight ahead, the clarify and sharpnes is far superior to RIft. If you eyes deflect even few degrees (i.e. reading a short sentence in VR), the image becomes very blurry. The only way to deal with this is to move your head as you read line or scan around. This is very unnatural thing to do. Try reading a book where you have to move your head instead your eyes. Perhaps you can get used to it, but the question is WHY? Rift allows wider eye movement without affecting pixel clarity - not unlimited but far wider then Vive and infinitely more comfortable. If you are ready to spend money on a HMD, find a friend or a store and test drive both models.VIVE PRO is around the corner. Hopefully it will feature better optics and with currently revealed specs will outdo Rift in all areas. If you can, hold off your purchased for couple of months until PRO is released.

I tried Dell VR out before but it had some QA issues (dirty box, peeling matte texture, etc).  Anyways I switched to this and the display looks so much better.  Its lower resolution so the screen door effect is there but it looks so good in comparison to Dell VR.WMR = Windows Mixed Reality**I am only referring to my experience with the Dell VR.  I have not tried other WMR headsetsPRO• High quality controllers• Good display compared to cheaper WMR (I have not tried the odyssey)• Easy to setup• Long cords• Charger for each controller (I'd think most companies would try to get away with just one for two controllers so way to go HTC)• Adjustable IPD though I don't really see much of a difference• Glasses fit inside the headset (kinda snug)• The play area boundaries are much nicer than the WMR ones.  (WMR boundaries look terrible, are confusing and pop in randomly)• Tracking is fantastic.  Much better than WMR but that's to be expected.  When I throw something in WMR it either falls 1ft in front of me, flies at the speed of light, or goes glitching off in a random direction.  You can throw things in WMR but you have to practice and it breaks the immersion.• Upgrade-able.  Not 100% positive that this is a pro/con yet but you can use the Vive Pro headset or pimax 5k/8k with the vive controllers and lighthouses based on what I've researchedCON• Headphones are crap (use your own)• Internal controller batteries (once they're dead, check warranty, go to ifixit or toss them)• Massive and heavy plugins excluding the controllers.• Screen door effect (VASTLY prefer this over the blur in WMR headsets)• Slippery controllers (wear the strap or you'll put a hole in the wall)• Play space has a minimum size but its not listed in the box• No written setup instructions• Headset strap sucks.  It feels like it'll fall off.  (WMR blows it out of the water)

-1 star due solely to Amazon not providing included game codes (See ""SUPRISES,"" below).This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.  I've been working with computers for about 30 years and playing computer games since Pong (okay, Super Pong).  VR is something that always seemed possible but never came.  3D games kept getting overly realistic and VR never came.  Now it's here and I would rate it as exciting as any new technology I've ever seen.I truly wondered if I was going to get too old for games before VR would come.  Thanks HTC for preventing this!.  Now I only have to worry about self driving cars working by the time I'm too old to drive.The VIVE is truly revolutionary and kudos to HTC and Valve for going all the way.  This is a pioneering product._PROS_- The quality of the equipment is really nice.  Even the mounting hardware is really nice.  You can tell this came from a phone manufacturer.  Quality feel in everything.- The level of immersion is amazing.  After doing the solar system simulation in the Lab it's surprising to be back in reality.  It's holodeck._CONS_- It can be a little blurry in the peripheral vision but really not worth complaining about.  This stuff is only going to get better and I can see buying a new one every few years (but not from you Amazon ;).- The video card required to drive it can be fairly expensive.- The headset strap takes some adjustment but I think they're coming out with an upgraded one to address this.  Very minor.SURPRISES:- I didn't get the games that were advertised as included on 4/5/2017.  Amazon was supposed to email me codes when my item shipped byt they did not.Upon contacting Amazon twice and spending over an hour on the phone they acknowledged that they failed to send the code and emailed the next day to say, ""Too bad.""  (see below)On a positive note, HTC was able to get me a code after I sent them pictures of my box and serial numbers!Poor form Amazon.  Wasted a lot of my time.  You should really have a better help desk system for tracking issues Amazon.  Shame on you.  I think I may cancel Amazon Prime after I sleep on it.- The Lighthouse units you install in your room appear to have a motor in them.  They whir and vibrate a little but I guess they're made to do that?  Will need more research.  The only way to turn them off would be to unplug them._OTHER OPTIONS_It's hard to see how the Rift in its current form can match up to a system where you walk around a room in 3 dimensions.  If you're on the fence about VR my experience is that this or PlayStation are going to be the most regretless purchases.  It's also likely that if you're into Augmented Reality then the cheaper HoloLens stuff coming from MSFT in late 2017 might be more compelling.--My email from Amazon support (for posterity)...""Hello,I understand your concern as you have not received promotional certificate for 3 games with VR system.I'm sorry you weren't able to take advantage of this promotional offer before it expired.

Back in the 90's I bought (and returned) one of the earliest available VR headsets.  I returned it because tracking was slow, and It could barely achieve 640 x 480 and only in 16 colors.  for 256 colors you had to do 320 x 240.  None of the 3D games I had at the time would run on it.  The best thing it was good for was a portable screen for a portable DVD player.  ...and it was way too expensive for that.  That experience left me skeptical about consumer VR to say the least.My first experience with a friends Vive blew me away.  I easily spent 30 minutes just looking around the SteamVR starting room.  He then loaded up Lab (which contains several minigames), and I easily lost 2 hours of my life in the blink of an eye to a little mini-game called Longbow.  ...And then He showed me GoogleEarthVR  (Pretty Amazing if you've never seen it)  My prior experience was a complete lack of compatible titles, but a quick look on both Steam and Viveport show that there are hundreds of compatible titles for the Vive.That's all I needed to know, I ordered my own that same night.

It was good, it keeps cutting out a lot, not sure why... but its decent, I do kind of wish I waited on purchase as new headsets just got announced for this year, I dont regret purchasing it that much, but I do wish its not cut out during my games, I would return it, but I think my base station can be used with the vive index... not sure... I hope so, cuz thatd be my upgrade. I just dont know what i should do...Its a bit of a meh...  Its expensive, If it was cheaper i would be more satisfied. The cords are bulky also, qnd get in they so much set up time as well, and if u bump or move ur stations just a little you have to reset up. It can be a hassle. I do love it though, the best thing with it so far has been my experiences in VRchat... and also Moss. There isnt a lot out there, but more is coming. But deffinately wait and dont go out and purchase like I did. I was just really wanting to get into it. I wish there was better way of seeing the distance you had, there are lots of different choices, but i wish there was an alarm feature as well, so if your in the process of swinging ur hands and ducking around, it would beep if you got super close to a wall or something, because yes the play area is marked but that doesnt mean you can swing freely... i dunno how or what exactly they could do for that, but its just a tought, just like a distance thing, so you know if you swing here it is bad.Also i really wish there was a thumb stick on the controllers, the trackpad is great, but if they also had a thumb stick it would be like 10x better, the other thing is I wish there buttons were laid out like a steam controller or an xbox controller, so you could use it in other games. It would be readability of the controllers much better and then I wouldnt have to worry bout emulating my keyboard or figuring out what does what on the steam bindings. It would just make things better if they were named and organized like a normal controller. Like a wii remote with steam controller format, but using the vr system. That would be the best. Hell if they made a standard controller visable in VR that would be neat... but the other would be better.Also sorry if half of what i said sounded weird, I am half asleep just got done with a 12 hour shift.

As I write this review, VR is still in its early infancy - and quite frankly, it needs to get going. The HTC Vive headset is not about the high-resolution video. It's about being immersed in an experience - which the HTC does really well. You don't need the PRO version unless you have money to burn, because everything with VR is still really new. Oculus and HTC have poured their resources into this experience and these two companies have made good products.Remember, that when you buy this headset, you are still required to buy games or experiences that will go with the System, so expect to pay more than just the system sticker price. There are a few ""free"" games out there and they are good to get you off the ground, but soon you'll want to do other things. ""The Lab"" is a good place to start, but I also recommend games like Apollo 11 (Steam), Titanic VR (Steam), Fruit Ninja VR (Steam) and X-Plane 11 (Steam). X-Plane 11 was truly my favorite, because not only was I not expecting a great experience, but it's done really well - and I feel like the simulator is actually easier to use in VR. It's cool that you can peek over the dashboard and look for traffic or get close to the instruments to read the fine print. Using the hand controllers are a bit tricky in X-Plane 11, but once you get it all set, it's pretty fun. Start with the Cessna and work up from there. My personal favorite is the Baron.I am very excited that there are going to be new experiences coming out for VR in the future. The Vive system is well thought out and makes set up fairly easy. I say fairly because I have had to re-calibrate my room several times. One time I put the headset on and it looked like I was sitting on the floor. Another time I fired it up and the whole room was on a slant. Remember, once you set the Lighthouse sensors, they have to stay perfectly still - or you'll have to run the room set up again.Overall, I am very pleased. I work with computers every day, so I bought Virtual Desktop and started working inside the headset. I got rid of a bunch of monitors and just have one and the headset now - and its great. I do wear glasses and have noticed that the headset does push on them, so I prefer to wear contacts if I am going to use the Vive for extensive periods of time.I'd recommend this to anyone who is seriously thinking about getting into VR. It's worth the investment and the system is thought out very well.

Wow... VR has come a long way. Gone are the days of headache inducing laggy displays. But, before gushing more on the experience, let me start with the 4 reasons why this product got 4 instead of 5 stars:1) Software set up was actually very difficult and convoluted. Specifically, there are many different systems and it's totally unclear which ones to deal with when. Error message prevail until you figure out all the needed software updates!2) The headset is heavy and wired / tethered and so it's still clunky in that sense.3) Be prepared to set up the motion sensors (2 small, wired cubes) by attaching to walls, or buying and using stands.4) The VIVE headset has to be connected directly to the PC's graphic card via HDMI. If you plan to connect your computer monitor/TV, then you'll need a second port to your graphic card. Mine only offered 1 HDMI and 1 DVI, so I had to get a DVI to HDMI adaptor.If / when you get past setup difficulties, the system performs beautifully. The display quality and refresh rates are amazing (note, our unit is connected to a high-end CyberPowerPC ~$1,100). There are many games out there that don't require you to move around a lot; i.e., you can sit or stand. These are great (so you're not bumping into all your furniture).

It's difficult to describe how awesome VR is. You pretty much need to experience it yourself. Even old games like Skyrim and Fallout 4 that I have played and enjoyed in 2-D space are wondrous and new in VR. There are a lot of shorter/simpler games for VR out there, but don't dismiss them off the bat. Things like Beat Saber have amazing replayability. If you have a decently powered PC, or one that you can upgrade, You'll be blown away by how amazing gaming in VR can be.If you're considering a VR headset, and trying to decide between a Vive and a Rift, I'd give the following advice.Both headsets are basically the same when you consider screen quality.  At the time of this writing, the Rift is $100 less than the Vive.  If you are after a seated experience, or a small room-scale experience, go with the Rift for sure.  The Rift is fully supported by the Steam store, so you have access to all the games on Steam (and the frequent Steam Sales!) as well as the exclusives on Oculus' store (which are excellent).I feel that the Vive has a better room-scale experience, though.  Setup takes a bit longer, but you end up with a larger play area.  Also, the Lighthouse base stations don't require a USB connection, and only need to be connected to power. This worked out for me since the room I chose has several power outlets. I didn't have to use extensions cords.  The Rift, on the other had, uses cameras.  The setup that I tried out only really let you get a 180 degree area to move in, since you had to face the two included cameras at all times. You have to connect each one of the cameras to a USB port on your PC. If you need extensions, you have to use USB repeaters, which can get a little pricey.  Also, if you want a larger room-scale experience, you'll need to pick up at least one extra camera, probably two.  That's two more cameras, two more USB ports, more repeaters/extension cables, etc.  I feel that the roomscale is the best part of VR. My wife and I have gotten more exercise with the Vive than we have in a while. It's great for getting you off your butt!  Just make sure you get some extra face cushions. The Vive comes with two different sizes, and they get soaked with sweat pretty quickly!

I have been gaming since 1998, and I was very on the fence about VR being so young, first gen, etc. I thought ""it can't be that great."" I didn't like the lower resolution concept, I play on a 2k monitor. I didn't like the limited game selection. I was worried about movement in the games and how the controllers would feel.But I finally decided to bite the bullet and decide for myself.This is a game changer ladies and gentlemen. It is such an incredible experience to be so fully immersed in a world, all the little things fall by the wayside. The controllers feel so amazing in your hands and they're easy to use. Setup is straight forward. If you are on the fence like I was, PLEASE go ahead and give this a try.Some important things:The default harness is very uncomfortable. I recommend an upgrade.The microphone isn't great.And some people get motion sickness, including my wife. I'm thankful I don't experience this, but some will. Luckily most games have ""comfort"" modes to reduce this. Despite the cons, I still rate this 5/5 because I think this is a big game changer. The headset and controllers are really well designed, they just need to make a better default harness, and maybe tweak the mic.Also: I'm in shape and I still got sore after a days play. It's amazing!

The HTC Vive is a wonderful VR headset and can be used for a variety of different VR activities.Pro's+Vive was pretty comfortable and can easily be adjusted to fit.+Quality of the Vive was good, greatly assembled by HTC+Following instructions to setup was easy to do.+Came with a pair of headphones to use with it+Remotes came with a half charge on them.+A Unique experience everybody should try at some pointVirtual Reality is amazing and if you plan on buying it go ahead with the HTC Vive. But keep in mind you need to measure out the space you have in your room or area of playing. You need to have the space to use the VR, I can't emphasize that anymore. If you have low ceilings be aware, and careful. But as long as you can reach up without your hands touching ceiling you should be just fine.  Personally with my ceilings I can touch with my fingertips but I know the limit when using my VR headset. Also keep in mind some people will get motion sickness when using a VR headset, If you get motion sick at first limit yourself to play for little periods of time at first. When purchasing the Vive if you can't mount the base stations to the walls you will also want to purchase some tripods to place them on.  If you are planning on buying this for PC VR gaming go ahead and run the SteamVR Test before purchasing to see if you can run the games. Remember when you get this VR is still coming around there will be tons more applications, and games coming out for it. Overall, this was a good purchase for me, especially with the price I payed for mine. When you first get it there will be lots of free games to play so don't worry they will keep you busy for a while. The HTC Vive is one of a kind, It also make for great fun playing with friends or when friends and family come over!

I have had my Vive for a month or so and it has been quite the experience.  When it works it is great, when you lose tracking of the headset and/or controllers, not so much.  It is interesting that my son's vive works pretty well, where as for mine, which is set up the same way and meets all of the published guides has had real issues with the loss of tracking, making it very frustrating and annoying.  To this issue, Vive has been of little to  no help.  I have also had issues with trying to download the included software.  The first contact with Vive was answered with a auto reply of go to our support page and we will be in contact soon.  That was on Dec. 10th and I has still not heard from anyone.  It seems they have decided what questions that you are allowed to ask, and if it is not on their FAQs then you do not deserve their support or they are just not interested.Bottom line is I really dig the concept and am looking forward to working out all of the bugs, but you can not rely on Vive to provide any support.  You are pretty much on your own or possibly find some help from other users, but Vive support seems to be nonexistent.

I got rid of my Oculus Rift to upgrade to this headset.I had no issue with the set-up mounting the 2 lighthouses at 180deg at 6'6"" off the floor. Set-up-smooth ran and caused me no problem. the only thing is they say in the instructions that the lighthouses lights should turn white. That is wrong, they should turn green if they are good.The headset is crisp and I can read text inside VR. Screen-dooring was a minimum and games, movies and even the desktop look fantastic.The built in speakers are crisp and clean, if a little light on the bass.Tracking is excellent and very precise, in a 9'X7' use area. They claim mm precision, and I have no reason to doubt that claim.My only issue and why I give it 4 stars is the controllers are really not good. Smooth-motion is a far cry from the Oculus touch. They are big and holding them really needs a bigger hand, I end up having to put my middle finger over the trigger to 'choke up' enough to use the track pads. The tack pads themselves are not very precise so in game movement can get all over the place, but with practice it does get better.  The good news is the =next gen controllers, the knuckles should be coming soon and I can get rid of these batons.

My family is obsessed with this system! That being said, I must admit it was a bit of a pain setting it up! I purchased a gaming pc specifically for the Vive. The issue in installing the software was that the pc only had one hdmi port on the graphics card and the Vive and computer monitor both connect via hdmi. You need the monitor to follow vive's easy installation instructions but the headset also needs to be connected in order to continue setup! To compound my frustration, I was setting the system up during a blizzard! Couldn't just run out searching multiple stores for the necessary adaptor. My husband, kids and their friends were anxiously waiting to play while I uttered a few censored words! I attempted to use several adapters, won't even get into those that didn't work! Finally found a mini display port to display port adaptor at Office Max and it worked! We're still exploring the Vive games and experiences but so far it's everything they say it is! Very realistic, and excellent graphics! If you're considering this system, I suggest the tripods and ball mounts as well!

Words can not describe my undying love and admiration for the HTC Vive.  I have owned mine for about a month now and I still pick it up everyday and play at least one game.  My current obsession is Hover Junkers.Pros:Escape into other worlds,  away from the crushing mortgage debt, dead end job, and screaming children (nagging wife/barking dog/take your pick)The immersion is complete with room scale VR.  Nothing can describe how awesome sauce it is to interact with the world around youLots of games out for how new the tech is.  Granted most of them are ""early release"" there are some absolutely incredible games to be playedDoesn't take a super beefcake CPU.  I have an old i7 3770K and it runs fine with no apparent bottlenecks to the GPUCons:It DOES require a beefcake GPU to run this beast.  I recommend the GTX1070 however there are plenty of cheaper options out there(i.e. AMD RX 480)Freakin' cords:  If you pull the trigger on buying a Vive you will want some kind of over the head cord management.  I actually used some hair bands and carabineers to manage my cords.  Search YouTube there are some pretty creative ways to make it work.Make sure your system is ready before you drop the money.  I highly recommend getting the SteamVR Performance Test and insuring you are good to go.  Nothing would suck more than having the Vive sit in the box while you scramble to get your upgrade on just to play it.Takes a beast of a graphics card to run.  I dropped $400 quid on a 1070 before pulling the trigger.

Credit where due: when it works, it's fun. Light years from a great VR experience, but I don't think a great VR experience exists in the world yet.My main complaint is that one of the base stations simply stopped working out of nowhere and HTC straight up won't sell replacements. They don't sell 2.0 base stations. At all. Like, what? How can you sell a product, especially one that breaks easier than an egg shell, and not sell any replacements whatsoever? The only options I have are 1) buying another full setup for a thousand dollars, 2) spending $300 to downgrade to two 1.0 base stations, or 3) mailing the broken base station to them and waiting for a month (yes they told me a month) to get it mailed back.Other complaints: - Only some types of games/experiences work if you're using the cable headset. The cable is annoying and honestly the Vive shouldn't even exist unless it's all wireless. They have a $300 wireless extension you can buy, which should be considered mandatory and therefore you can assume your system will cost an additional $300. - Still heavy and clunky feeling while wearing it. Far too heavy to be particularly agile, can twist around on your head fairly easily if you play a game that moves at all, mainly due to it being too heavy. - Exacerbated by the fact that it moves around on you head, the way the lenses work is godawful... you need to look directly into the center of the glass in order to not have your entire vision blurred, so when you try to look even slightly into your peripheral vision all you see is blurred nonsense. Kind of defeats the purpose of having a high definition display if your lens is obscuring the majority of those extra pixels you paid so much for... - SteamVR software that runs the whole show is buggy, slow, needs to be restarted frequently, and overall seems like it's the very first prototype that worked when the engineers were first experimenting with a VR system, rather than an actual product that is sold to customers. To add insult to injury, I have to look at big popup advertisements from Steam every time I start the SteamVR program, when all I want to do is turn on my VR system and use it. - Customer support is only available by online chat, not phone, which means responses are much slower and you typically just get generic responses that don't help solve anything. Personally I actually think it's fine to have practically zero customer support, but only if you have a self-serve system that actually works, such as having products that rarely break and having ability to order replacements if things do break.

What else is there to say about VR...it's absolutely AMAZING!  About the closest I can equate it to that you might understand is from watching black and white TV all of your life and then seeing a 3D TV. I had tried some VR back in the early 90s, but this is far and beyond that.  Also, check out YouTube videos (like I did) and you will see that HTC's Vive is the way to go.  It is expensive, but well worth the price.  My mother of 75 absolutely loved it...with her heart condition and other health issues, she can't ride roller coasters for instance, but I was able to let her ride one from Six Flags.  There is also quite a bit of free content for the Vive via Steam today (and that is another plus for the Vive...it's linked to Steam).  You can be guaranteed that since you are adding content via Steam, that it will still be around in the event you change to another Steam supported VR platform...I've been burned by other companies having their own software platforms and then going bankrupt, but I think we can assume that Steam is here to stay for a while.:)

So, I got this to help me with some virtual reality media creation. Particularly for the Eye Tracking as, AS FAR AS I AM AWARE, the Valve Index does not have a modification that allows for eye tracking on it (which I would prefer to use as it allows for an 80hz refresh rate compared to the 90hz on the VPE)Quick review:Eye Tracking - GreatFace Tracking Addon - Horrible mounting solution, falls off constantly for me. Whoever designed this, well... they did their best but its still horrible.Screen - OLED is great, little bit of initial screen door but it goes away quickly.FOV - Low. Way too low.Audio - Literally the worst audio I've heard, both mic and output. Mic sounds like i'm talking through a static receiver half a room away. Which, you know, at first i did go to check if i had the wrong input selected, but nope. It's just bad. Pick up a modmic or something.Anyways. I'd prefer to see some of the features of this headset like eye tracking and such in something better, like an index. That's all.

After having and using this for a year and half, there are so many technical issues that randomly come and go-especially with updates-that I believe I have spent more time researching/troubleshooting and restarting my computer over and over, than actually using VR. It seems to be the same with all VR headsets. This is on multiple different systems that far exceed the max recommendations and with new/re-installs, upgraded hardware (including 2.0 base stations).

Really very impressive. The cost is steep (even at $100 off for Black Friday) but the experience is astonishing. The feeling of presence really is as true as they say, and it's really easy to get lost in the experience. As far as the hardware, setting up can be a bit tricky, but so far it's working exactly as described. This isn't motion control like you're used to; it's nearly 1:1 with how you're moving your head and hands in every direction. being able to walk around the virtual world definitely adds to the experience, so make sure you have very ample space. I measured out my room and it seemed fine, but I just barely made the minimum for roomscale, so be careful here.I give the headset 5 stars because it is implemented incredibly well, but I will give one word of warning: the experiences are sparse. There are not many VR games available today, and for a new purchase this expensive, it's hard to justify buying a bunch of VR games just to try them out. Those that are hoping the $800 is the end may be disappointed, as this is only the beginning of the cost, as I've reached the limit of the current free offerings fairly quickly. So, even though the hardware is incredibly solid, keep in mind that the experiences take time to develop, and that the current selection is sparse. One side note though is that this is absolutely incredible for watching youtube videos on the big (theater size) screen. This is definitely designed with the gamer in mind, but this functionality alone is very compelling to non-gamers as well.Overall I'm happy with my purchase and hopeful that new experiences will continue to be released and push the bounds of the hardware.

Being using original Vive since May 2016. Almost exclusively with prescribed lenses because my eyesight is not so good. So all this time I could really see the screen door effect of the original Vive. It was nearly impossible for me to 'forget' about it, only briefly during some dark scenes. But! With the Pro model SDE is much much less noticeable, text is much much more readable. I can finally almost forget about SDE and just keep playing or watching movies on the Big Screen.Enhanced comfort is not something to be frown upon. There are three major points here: finally I can wear my glasses with absolutely no discomfort and no lens scratching on the tightest dial. It's way lighter (especially then the first version of the original Vive) and it sits tighter and doesn't wiggle on your face.Pros:- Much less noticeable SDE (still visible though)- Text became readable even on 1.3 SS- Giant leap in a comfort. It's lighter and sits tighter- Cable is lighter. But a proprietary port makes it difficult to extend - not a problem for me though, the length is absolutely sufficientCons:- Price is high for just HMD- Plastic is somewhat more crackier then original Vive. Not a big deal, but I like sturdy thingsSome people find headphones not OK. But I could hear any difference between OG and Pro headphones.

My husband and I switch this out between our computers. It can be annoying but after some fiddling we got the wall mounts to work for both( or computers are side by side).  If you have games that require a lot of arm movement, prepare those around you or items. We've had to replace a few objects that hung on the wall so far lol. The googles took me a while to get to work to how I like it. They were blurry for me, but after research I found the side dial adjust things. The instructions were lack luster and we ended up googling, youtubing and looking at forums in the end. It does come with a bundle of ""Free"" games from the viveport app. Steam is where we ended up purchasing all our games and then account sharing most of them. We both can't really play longer than 30 mins without feeling drunk after taking it off. If we had more room I'd suggest getting the stand mounts and accessories. Overall this was a fun anniversary present to ourselves, and only purchased due to the price drop. The headband could be better and the cords are heavy and get in the way. That is really my only complaint.

I have owned the PS VR, original Vive, Oculus, and Vive Pro, so I can compare them all. Yes, the Vive Pro is expensive, but if you can afford it, the Pro is worth it and beats all the rest. You may want a faster CPU and GPU to fully power this beast so you can increase the super-sampling for games like Skyrim VR. That said, the sharper graphics for a fully modded and fine-tuned Skyrim are awe-inspiring! The screen door effect is substantially reduced increasing immersion. Those that don't notice a difference haven't done the work to mod the game.The comfort of this headset cannot be understated compared to the original Vive. It's similar to the Deluxe headgear of the original Vive, but a bit better. It's far easier to put on and adjust, which is great for newbies who come over and want to try VR for the first time. The headphones had a problem with poor bass, but once I installed the updated Vive drivers and de-checked the reduce gain box in the Steam VR settings, the sound fidelity becomes clear and loud. I now have no desire to replace the headphones with something else. Rumbling thunder, music, and rolling boulders all sound great. I also installed a 3D sound mod for Skyrim and get life-like, directional sound that is both immersive and highly useful.I recommend suspending the wire from the ceiling using a kit on Amazon until they come out with the wireless add-on for the Pro. Combine this with the Locomotion app on steam, a fan to give you a nice breeze, and you'll want to jog around Skyrim for hours and never leave. Seeing the northern lights and two giant moons suspended over a gorgeous waterfall and castle atop a mountain is a surreal experience that is beyond words.

The experience you have with the HTC Vive is far from anything else. Everyone I have shown is in awe and wants to continue to play. It truly shows where the future is going for gaming. There are several caveats to this, the first being you need a fairly powerful gaming PC for this to work. I have a i5 paired with the GTX970. This in gaming terms is a solid gaming pc, however for the Vive it is the bare minimum. For most games I have little issue, but for higher graphic intensive games I have to set the graphics to a lower setting. In addition, the setup is not the easiest and you will want a full room just so you have plenty of room to walk around. Then the price, for the average person the price tag is a sticker shock. BUT, and this a big but! If you have a ready gaming pc, a room that is open (at least 10ft by 10ft with higher ceilings), and can handle the sticker shock then I assure you this purchase is well worth it! This VR set is far ahead of the Playstation VR and the Oculus Rift because of the fact you can room scale which is walk around and it will track you with your headset and remotes. You become so submersed, and can easily forget about the real world. So excited to see where this technology goes! Last note is their customer service is responsive but I did have a power adapter go bad and they wanted me to pay for shipping to send it in. I fought for free shipping and received it but was not overall happy with the experience.

TL;DR; - 1x controller dead on arrival, very poor customer service, still waiting on a refund nearly 3 weeks after confirmed receipt at Amazon Warehouse!---After receiving the product and paying very expensive shipping to Hong Kong, while it was noted as ""Used"" I let the initial impressions of a bad smelling device (musty smell) go, and get down to seeing how the device actually performed.Getting everything installed was OK, but once in VR, it was noted that one of the controllers wasn't working properly - either as though the home button was jammed on, or the battery wasn't holding charge. Contacted the seller who offered ""$75 for a repair"" of the item. It was visible on that specific controller that the device had been opened before. This was the state that it ARRIVED in.

We're working hand in hand with our repair center to have this sent back to you soon.Thank you and have a great day!Sincerely,Vive SupportI wish to God that I had just returned this to Amazon.Edit: 9-11-17 :  Right out of the blue I came home and had a package that was 2 day air mailed to me from seattle. Come to find out HTC has sent me a new (or reman I cant tell) headset that is definately not my old one I mailed to Texas. I plugged it in and now am having a blast. I would  like to thank the HTC support team for the favor and I will raise my review to 4 stars.

This headset is strictly better that the non-pro headset. Yes, graphics are way sharper,  but there are several improvements like: volume control is on headset, unit fits to your face and secures with slide over back of head, there’s a tightening knob that gets the fit just right, and best of all the weight distribution is so much better, it looks and feels so MUCH better! Older non-pro headset pulled on my face over time, I had to snug it so tight to keep it from slipping that my face would have imprints—this issue is completely resolved! So, yes the graphics are gorgeous— but don’t underestimate the value of proper fit! If you VR more than 20 minutes at a time, this headset is totally worth the extra bucks.

I wanted to enjoy this product but I found the visor too heavy and hot and the slightest misalignment in wearing the visor takes one or both eyepieces out of focus.  It's very sensitive to precise positioning on the face.  To keep it in place it had to be strapped on so tightly I sort of felt like I was wearing a Half Life 2 face crab but one equippedwith VR, if a face crab supported VR.The resolution wasn't high enough for the flight simulations I wanted to use it with - DCS's, even though they're supported - and I found myself yearning for my LCD panel and trackir setup instead of using this item - and the controls should really be mesh gloves with finger tracking instead of awkward sticks.  HTC nailed the tracking:  The control and visor tracking was dead on.

Great the 3 times I used it. It was kept in its original packaging when not in use... this thing looks and feels brand new and yet the fourth time I took it out of its box it no longer works! The screen just has snow (like the old TVs would have). I tried unplugging the cable and plugging it back into the headset but still just snow. Not sure if the cable is somehow malfunctioning or if it’s the port itself or whether there is some other unseen problem causing it. HTC does not make it easy to contact them regarding the the warranty as they only advise that I contact the retailer that I purchased it from to start the warranty process. However Amazon does not give me the option to contact the retailer when I pull up my order history. They only give a link for the HTC support library which it notes is “offered by HTC” but the HTC support library doesn’t give anyway to contact them about the warranty. Plus I am suppose to the contact the retailer according to the warranty documents! A 1,000 dollar device and virtually no real support from the manufacturer from opening the box to the time it stopped working! Don’t waste your money! I doubt HTC will honor my warranty!

Every time I put this on I can help but be impressed by how far gaming has come. Originally I thought this generation of VR was going to be gimmicky and terrible, but eventually I saw a warehouse deal and pulled the trigger on buying it. There are days where I'd live in my headset if I had the option.There is a ""screen door effect"" on this version of the headset. Basically you can notice the lines inbetween the pixels in your monitor and it makes it look like you have your face pressed against a screen looking at the world around you. However, VR is so immersive that I can quickly ignore and forget about the effect easily. Now I really only notice it if I'm trying to look for it.A common issue with the controllers is the right button on the trackpad won't click. After looking at some guides online and complaints about how long HTC is to repair these controllers, I decided to take my chances and fix the controller myself. It wasn't super easy, but it was possible. The first time I fixed it I didn't use any adhesive to secure my fix in place, so the button stopped working again after a while. My second fix seems to have fixed it for good, but opening the controller voids the warranty on it.I'd give it 5 stars if HTC didn't ship out controllers with a common design flaw. I think if I had gotten the Pro headset I would never take it off.

I bought this as a gift for my brother, who has so graciously allowed me to play it as well (once). I wear glasses that are not all that large, but even with tiny John Lennon glasses, I couldn't hope to fit my nerdy visage into the headset. Therefore, as someone who does not know their pupillary distance off the top of their head, I could not quite get the settings right to see some of the in-game menus. I literally had to lean down/put the controllers right to my face to see anything. My brother, however, is a bigger nerd that me and actually does know his PD off the top of his head, therefore this problem does not apply to him, and as its his Vive and not mine, I won't take any stars off. I wish there was a wider array of settings to accommodate for such an issue, but I believe there are prescription lenses that you can purchase to accompany the device. However, after spending $500 on the basic set, buying pricey accessories for it is... Not cool. But overall, the VR is amazing and I had a whale of time. Can't wait for more VR games specifically, instead of just ports. Also can't wait to buy myself contacts for my little mole eyes, as I wish to play it more should my ever loving Vive-hoarding dragon of a brother lets me.

I loved how all the headset cables are bundled into one 9ft cable, also loved how easy the setup was.  I absolutely hated the resolution.  I used Gear VR for a while with my Note 5, the picture is NO BETTER than that.  Major screen door effect (could actually see RGB from each pixel on each resolution change), text blurriness on the highest resolutions, couldn't find one resolution configuration that felt comparable to a 1080p monitor.  I would have figured I could find one config I liked with this 500 dollar machine.  Also the focusing lenses are warped on the edges unnecessarily.  I'm not buying a VR headset again until I try one where I can't notice the individual pixels.  I guess it does what it says, but your smartphone in Cardboard or Daydream provides the same experience (less Steam VR) but without wires.

A product is only good as it's support.I've never had this 'Just work"" when I wanted to play it, usually requiring 30 to 60 minutes of configurations every day I'd like to play it. But it's a new technology, that can be forgiven.The MiniDP input on the control box? Don't use it, don't try to use it. It doesn't work reliably. Again, new technology, fine.One of my controllers stopped working properly (The right side of the touch pad would stop registering). Fine, a defect. I send it back to HTC, having to pay shipping myself (14 bucks). Then I get confirmation from UPS that it has shown up on March 2nd. Thats cool. But HTC support tracking website? No update at all. I contact customer service, they say 'Yes we have it and are working on it"". And then nothing. I contact them again, same answer. I email them, twice, ZERO response. They say turn around time is 7 to 10 days. Its been 14 days. All they can tell me is ""Support is overloaded, but they are working on it"". Zero ETA, zero update on their own online support tracking site.Long story short, god help you if you need any kind of service or repair on this.

I had a friend at work that has had the Vive since the release date and brought it to work for us to try out over the holidays. OMG - I was blown away. Me and another employee bought ours the next day.  I consider myself a casual gamer but have been turned off by the millennial FPS Call of Duty 13 movement. But this is a game changer.I have owned the HTC Vive for month now and I am hooked. Having a blast, everything has worked great. I bought the bundle with the Cyberpower tower and it's a workhorse for the price. I added another 8gb of Viper ram and it performs excellent. The future of entertainment is here, going to be great to watch VR progress. There is some noticeable screen door effect (SDE) but this is only 1st gen and it doesn't take away from the overall experience.You will need a mini dp to dp cable, have no clue why HTC was too cheap to include this for the $800 price tag. It's an inexpensive cable that I have never heard of.Games are inexpensive and go on sale all the time and this VR headset is completely open source, so lots of content and possibilities for the future.

So Vive 2.0 Needs- Higher Resolution screens, independent eye X,Y adjustment knobs for each eye, wireless integration , better face pads, decreased weight , alarm when approaching solid objects it room, better lenses.  Then VR is ready for the masses , but it's still pretty friggin awesome right now. I used to think VR was a gimmick.  Now it's all I want and I want MORE! This thing had me giggling like a little boy on just the VR tour straight from Steam....  Don't regret my purchase one but. However it does have me saying VIVE - SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY. Gloves are going to be so AWESOME !!!!!!!!  And guns , and the cool motion attachments they are coming out with.  I bought this with VirZoom bike and it's been an amazing purchase. I haven't even played many VR games with it but that is only to get better the more people who buy VR systems the more games will come out and Developers will take a serious look at this market.

Setup can be a bit tedious for a beginner, but once setup works like a champ.  I have an old PC in my livingroom i was using for home a theater.  Needless to say the AM3 platform with a Phenom II X4 955 wasnt cutting it. (laggy)  Since computer parts are stupid expensive it just maxxed out the CPU on the old platform for a Phenom II X6 1100T and it smoothed everything out.  I am running a Radeon RX580 and it seems to be a good pair and 8GB of DDR3.  Keeping old hardware alive for now.  I would call this minimum spec thats actually not laggy.

My first experience with VR was in 1996 with the virtual boy, that lasted about 20 minutes before my eyes couldn't handle it anymore.  now 20+ years later the HTC Vive delivers on what I had imagined years ago.Can you see the pixels?  Yes, but it's no worse than the late 90s CRT monitors we all played starcraft on.is the tracking perfect: I've seen a .2-.5 cm deviation in physical location and digital location.  pretty darn close to dead on.Will you get a little motion sick?  possible, some immersion designers have done a damn good job to minimize it, others have not.Will i brick something my first day and be stuck with HTC customer ""support?"" it's always possible, when you go to update drivers besure to read and understand  the instructions before you start.  also, when you set up the  room scale play area, do your best to make sure your not going to swing into anything not JUST  the walls.Better tech is always on the horizon, and this is now in that sweet spot of cost V.s. performance.

The HTC Vive is a surprisingly good VR device. When I first got this, I didn't realize how immersive it would be. When you put on the headset and headphones, you get lost in a virtual world that sincerely feels like you are there.While I think there is a lot that could be improved upon, the HTC Vive is definitely worth it. The experience is sincerely amazing, and it's a blast to share that experience with friends and family.Pros:+ Easy to use; The controls are intuitive, the user interface is intuitive, so the HTC Vive is very accessible.+ Immersive; You really feel like you are in a virtual reality.+ Graphics; Surprisingly good graphics. With supersampling, you can increase the quality of the graphics as well.+ Tracking; The tracking is mind blowingly accurate and fast.. As a result, people do not get nauseous or sick when using the HTC Vive.+ Battery Life; The controllers will last quite a long time before you have to recharge, and the VR UI tells you when they are low on power.Cons:- Sweat; After a length of time, and lots of movement, you can start to sweat on the VR device. Make sure to wash with alcohol in-between use.- 3-in-1 Cable; It can get caught in your legs, or you stumble over it from time to time.- Base Box Installation; The base box's have to be screwed into the wall. If you can't do that, you'll have to place them flat on a surface, or buy tripods with ball-joints to correctly place your base box's. Sadly, the HTC Vive does not come with tripods for your base box's, you will have to buy them separately.- Headphones: The headphones that come with the HTC Vive fall out a lot. I bought myself my own pair of over-the-ear headphones to use with my HTC Vive.Overall: Totally worth it. Experiencing it, and experiencing other people experiencing it, has been an absolute blast. I look forward to future generations of the HTC Vive, along with the fun accessories that are bound to come.

Received my unit and it worked fine for about 6 weeks. Then one of the base stations started flashing a red light. Attempted to call support (Oops they don't support phone calls, only text chat, I wonder why). So turns out this is a common issue.

Very satisfied with package from VR Park. Was in original box resealed. All components were clean, resealed in plastic bags and cords neatly packed. Came with everything but wall mounts, but small price to pay. Minus the box being resealed if you sat this one next to a brand new set you would not be able to tell the difference. No issues with playing games. If you watch videos or have a friend help you with initial setup and pairing you should be good. Only issue I encountered was having to re-pair a remote with the system in the initial setup, however easy fix. Overall VERY satisfied with this company and their products.

This is awesome. Requires some space to use effectively  and  it’s active gaming so I likely play for shorter amounts of time than non VR gaming becuase im actually moving around. Room scale VR is the way to go until next gen tech arrives with good stand alone headsets that have inside out tracking. So far the vive has been the best setup for VR I’ve used. It’s actually  great for working out if you get a boxing game like Thrill of the Fight or a dance/ rythym game. Accuracy of tracking is very good making shooting games really fun. Some types of artificial movement in VR games can cause many people to get motion sickness but by using a room scale setup like Vive offeres and teleportation this isn’t much of an issue for me. Requires a powerful PC and graphics card and takes a little effort to first setup but but if you have at least 11 feet of clear space in a room to use this setup it’s amazing.

Excellent headset and definitely a top tier device. Tracking is not an issue here between the base station and eye tracking. Controllers may take some getting used to if you're switching from valve index, Oculus, or upgrading from one of the vive cosmos headsets. Battery life for controllers are great.

There are also attachments that can be purchased such as a wireless adapter alternate facemask head rests etc. Great purchase for those who are brave to try and for those looking for the next step up in vr.

Hey my name is Brady and I would consider myself a tech enthusiast. I have loved to mess around with anything that had some sort of electrical components in it, anything from taking apart the family computer to see what was inside to repairing smartphones for friends. Tech is something that I have always loved and the HTC Vive was no different. I bought the Vive about 2 months ago and I don’t think I’ve spent much time since then in the real world. VR is something that I think everyone needs to try at least once in their life, it’s simply something that will make you smile no matter what you’re doing. You can mess around in the “home screen” walk around and draw anything your mind can think of, but it’s when you load up a game that the Vive really starts to show off. The HTC Vive has full room tracking so you are able to walk around in the real world and actually move in VR, this might sound like something that’s a bit of a no brainer but it’s actually pretty awesome. You can work your way around an enemy in a game like Super Hot, or go for a stroll through the streets of Paris with Google Earth. At the end of the day it doesn’t matter what game you’re playing it all feels real thanks to the Vive. it puts you in another world and makes you feel like you have become your favorite character. It alows you to play games like they were meant be played, running through the world exploring all the different paths and discovering new things around you. The Vive alows you to disconnect from the world for awhile, away from the chaos of life, and have fun exploring a new world. Just remember don’t get too lost you have work in the morning.

The Vive was my gateway to an Index. The Vive has a very prominent screen door effect, and overall lower graphics quality. It gave me a taste of VR that left me wanting a better experience. The HMD is meh, the controllers are meh, it's just a really mediocre VR experience.

I am glad to say that I was truly surprised how well Vive VR actually worked. Usually there is a lot of hype but the product just not measure up to how well it should perform.  Not the case with the HTC Vive.  My son and I received this as a joint Christmas present.  My 14 yr old son installed it and set up the hardware and play area.  When I put on the headset and started using it I was amazed.  Not only are the games totally immersive but the demo software showed some of the potential applications!  The hardware seems durable.  The headset has been dropped a couple of times and the hand controllers have hit solid objects like a filing cabinet.  So, the bigger the play area the better! I recommend the Vive to everyone.

Setup was overall pretty easy, though it took me a while to get supersampling and quality/performance settings set to a proper level for my rig where HMD judder was completely eliminated, but adding a GTX 1080Ti to my rig helped with that a lot (I had a 1060, which really is the absolute minimum, but I found it couldn't keep up in some apps). I've got the TPCast wireless adapter being delivered soon and am really looking forward to being ""untethered"" during my VR sessions (tripping over the cable gets old quick).

Great new experience. You wear the headset and you are transported to another world (Not just for games). Yes, there is the screen door effect but you'll forget about it once you started the activity.  I have no problem moving around. The environment and movement are rendered smoothly. No judder. So far, I have not experience motion sickness yet. The set up is easy as long as you already have your place cleared and have an outlet or extension cord where you can plug the two sync boxes.In addition, you don't need a high end PC to run the vive. It runs smoothly on a PC with FX4350 on a gigabyte micro ATX motherboard, RX480 graphics card and an 8GB memory.  The system is great but at this price, they could have included additional foam padding (not just one) as after you play, foam is already soaking wet. Also having a deluxe strap makes it easier to wear, adjust and remove the headset.

This device has changed me as a person. I am now aware we are living in the future and that this is the first step in how we are going to be consuming media and how video games are going to be created. There is no describing what being in virtual reality is like, it can only be experienced for oneself. The software for the Vive is constantly being updated and it is not without bugs. I am regularly having to troubleshoot for problems that many others are experiencing as well, so I don't believe I would recommend this purchase for anyone other than enthusiasts.

I had my doubts right after I purchased this. However when it arrived it was a whole new story, assembly is a bit of a pain, however when you get the VR working it’s 100% worth it. I’ve been wanting a vive for awhile and I finally got my hands on it, so far I have 0 regrets on this item. I wear glasses and they fit perfectly into the headset and the remotes are comfortable and can be easily tracked by the sensors no matter what im doing. However when my Vive arrived it had a code for a bundle of apps to play on viveport, when I put the code in, it read as invalid. Luckily for me steam always has sales going on and they have plenty of VR games! I freaked out right when I got into playing. it’s absolutely amazing how far virtual reality as come.

I was never a gamer much, played some D&D years ago, a few FPS games but 2D left me bored, well, not any more! 3D VR is the ONLY way to play games. I think the Vive is the best out there, bandwidth for true wireless VR isn't there yet, and the cable doesn't bother me at all (so far). I have about 20 different games and all are fun, some, like Beat Sabre, are addictive as can be, also Audio Shield. Plenty of FPS games to pick from. Updates to both the games and platform are automatic. It does take a pretty powerful system to get the full effect so be aware that your 5 year old PC won't cut it. I built a 8 core I7/8700 with all SSD's and GTX graphics, works great! Step up to 3D VR and you won't go back to flat screen.

In almost all areas, the Vive Pro overshadows the Rift S in almost every way.Compared to the Rift S, the hand tracking is already leagues better at the cost of actually having to mount base stations around your play area (which for me wasn't a problem, but if you live in an apartment or something that may be an issue). The Vive Pro headset is more comfortable than the Rift S was. I haven't noticed fogging lenses during play like the Rift S, but this could change.The main issue I have with the entire thing is that the controllers are mediocre at best. Compared to the Rift S controllers, the HTC wands are a huge step backwards. The grip buttons on the side of the controller are really hard to press and hold, so for games like Boneworks this makes the experience a lot more tedious than it needs to be. Blade and Sorcery combats this by making the grip button toggle instead of hold, which I appreciate, but even so the grip is still terrible. Also, the trackpads on the controllers are clunky and poorly designed. Movement is stunted quite often and turning around using the trackpads is a nightmare. However, these controllers are pretty study and they work, that's good right?All in all solid choice for quarantine VR, but I would definitely order controllers for later on.

I had an HTC Vive a few years ago. I decided to go with the Vive pro. One base station only flashes red and won’t connect. Never had any issues with the old system, but this is so far not good. If I can’t resolve this today, it’s going back. The headphones also have a constant crackling noise in the headphones. It’s not even that fun to use. Thinking I will send this back.Open to changing my rating if this is resolved, but it’s unlikely.

It is a great product but it is just not there yet. After prolonged use, the low resolution starts to really bother, especially when playing AAA titles like Fallout 4. While arcade/cartoon-like games seem fun and enjoyable, and actual game suffers dramatically. The headset is not the most comfortable either, it puts a lot of pressure on head and neck after a while. The cables are another downside as they get in the way of true immersion. If you wear glasses, you'd need to use contacts with vive since glasses fog up in vive, and it also puts more pressure on your nose.With all that said, it is a very solid product. Amazing experience. I just thinks it is not there yet, and the $599 price tag is hefty. If for the next gen the solve the cable issue, and increase resolution, it would definitely receive 5 stars.

I purchased the Lenevo Mirage Jedi Challenge AR headset to see how far the technology had come along. I was blown away by the Mirage and the Jedi Challenge setup. I do 3+ hours a week of lightsaber duels for exercise now. My overall satisfaction with AR gave me the confidence to put some money out for the VR experience(that and I had a PC that could handle it already). I have to say I was even more surprised with the HTC Vive. It is truly everything I expected and more. The only thing I wish I had done is gotten the Pro instead of the regular setup. It is truly an immersive experience and not just a gimmick. I recommend to any Egg Hunter out there who has been waiting to boot up the Oasis. The wait is over friends, it is here.

It’s an awesome technology that will absolutely blow your mind. That’s until your base stations stop working less than 6 months into owning it and you want to blow HTC supports mind. They expect you to pay for shipping under a warrantied device then take MONTHS to repair the device. If the company wasn’t so terrible at customer service I would say purchase this product. Instead purchase an oculus rift because HTC wants to ruin their customer base.

Truly a phenomenal experience. This technology is stunning at the stage it is at. The Vive technology has the ability to perfectly mimic in game your entire body movements to really create an immersive experience. On the flip side though the wires going down your back can be distracting at times and if you spin around way too fast it can lag for a split second. A tiny thing, but none the less.The headset feels comfortable. BE CAREFUL sweating too much with it on! I've read posts about internal chips shorting out because of too much sweat... And you will sweat.Multiplayer experiences are more enjoyable with the built in microphone. Playing an online shooter had me jumping to the ground behind virtual cover as blasts of paint flew over me. My heart raced. I am compelled just walking through works of art or walking streets in Google Earth. Visiting old friends houses and the neighborhood I grew up in is a surreal moment.Virtual reality in its early stages is phenomenal as an experience. I'd recommend waiting out and buying the inevitable next iteration of the Vive. VR technology is only getting more incredible and we have seen the new bits and bobs coming out of CES 2017. It will be better than it is now... so maybe wait for the better experience. But if you are like me and just have to try it then this is the best way to get it. Room scale is incredible. I recommend.

Ran fine for the first day (used it for about an hour and a half) but after getting home from work the second day tried to use it and the screen wouldn't work then it lost all connections. Went through all the troubleshooting but had to send it in for repair. Warranty doesn't cover replacing the main board for ANY liquid damage including sweat so the repair bill is more than half the cost of the system. Customer service was friendly and directions for troubleshooting were clear and easy to follow but ridiculous that something you move around in while its strapped to your face doesn't protect against sweat and the warranty doesn't help you out.

This has been an amazing experience and everyone that I have shown it off to has been blown away.  Definitely lives up to the hype.  Be sure to carefully adjust the system to fit your head properly as any kind of looseness will result in a blurry image.  Normally I wear glasses for slight nearsightedness (55 17) but I don't need them for the vive.  I actually started with the glasses on and the way the system works this is fine too, there's room to wear glasses while the set is on.I don't have an especially large play area and as long as you're not whipping your hands around or body around I don't see a possibility of injury.  Also be careful about the type of game you play.  Roller-coaster style games I can see as causing motion sickness but for the most part if you stick to 'interact with the environment' games, stationary shooters, puzzle games, strategy games, board game simulator I don't see how you could get motion sickCheers Vive, good job!

Fast delivery.  Clearly packaged at the factory and it is exactly what I expected.  I am not a gamer and have never used a VR headset before.  Took a little while to get it set up and part of the problem was just terminology I had never dealt with before.  Biggest problem I have found has nothing to do with the product or Amazon, but, it the lack of internet info of how to get started as a novice.

It’s a good VR headset, definitely worth the current price.I had an Oculus Rift and recently bought the Vive. Comparing the two, Vive has better 360° tracking without having to buy the extra sensor the Rift would have needed. I feel like the lenses and overall resolution for the Vive are also better than the Rift, but it’s not as drastic of a difference as some people seem to believe. The face cushion on the Vive is also way better, which may not seem like such a big deal, but it makes the experience more enjoyable than when I felt like the Rift was cutting into my face.The setup was easy, both the hardware and the software. The only thing I really miss about the Rift are the controllers. Vive’s controllers are large, feel awkward to hold at first, and take a while to get used to.Overall, a good purchase if you’re looking for a good VR experience and have the money for it.

I do love my HTC Vive Pro, which I'm using almost daily for one month and this product is one of the most significant things which I got during the last years. At the beginning I had few technical difficulties, like wobbling image and sound setting, but it has nothing to do with the product quality - all you have to do is to browse the relevant sights and find the best solution. The possibilities are endless and the HTC support team is very quick and efficient, helping you with any questions regarding VIVE, VIVE portal and the software.

I've been using my Vive for 4 days now and I absolutely love it. Its a hit with me and my housemates. We've even relocated my computer to a friends place to play it at a party. Everyone that tried it had a wonderful time and the system worked fabulously. HOWEVER, on the 3rd day one of the controller track pads suddenly stopped clicking on one side. I was disappointed but it was still playable. HOWEVER, the very next day the second controller's track pad malfunctioned in the exact same place. Neither controller has had any major abuse outside a few mild bumps. I found out later this is a rather common problem. Which is disappointing after an $800 investment because you still have to buy the games, optional audio strap (trust me you want the upgrade, its way more comfortable) and stands if your not going to mount the bay stations to the wall. As a product i whole heartedly give this device a 5/5 but damage after less then a week is just not acceptable. (I will amend my score if they happen to honor my refund)Update: HTC honored my warrenty and Amazon refunded my purchase allowing me to replace the damaged controller's. It's still frustrating that it shipped with so many problems but I can't deny that I'm having so much fun with my new vive. Its a hefty price point but I hope VR becomes more mainstream because the technology is definantly there and is definantly a blast to play

Stay the hell away from VR, I'm 0/2 having bought a broken Oculus Rift S and now a broken HTC Vive. At least the Rift took 5 days to break, instead of the literal 50 minutes of use i got on the HTC before the update killed my base station.

Okay first, I wanted to give this 5 stars because all-in-all the experience is amazing, However the setup was a nightmare.If you're buying this expecting a plug and play setup, get that thought out of your head right now. There's a lot that can go wrong and most chances are that it will. Setup involves going though steamVR and connecting everything to the comp before you even see the screens of the headset light up. Personally I had two major problems. Firstly, steamVR simply wouldn't start up(which is required to even complete the initial setup). Secondly, the controllers would turn themselves off a second or two after turning them on (yes, the controllers were charged and paired). What made things worse is that the support for the vive is absolutely horrible. After hours of looking up solutions for my problems I reached the conclusion that while many people were having the same problem with steamVR error code 307, everyone had different answers for what was causing the problem. Needless to say by the end of it I was beyond frustrated, because the problems could be caused by literally anything. I had made the decision at that point to just return the system. After cooling down for a bit, I came back to the problem, and luckily was able to find the issue, which funnily enough was being caused by my graphics driver(which was completely up to date), I actually had to roll it back to an earlier version from april. then BAM steamVR started up no problem and I was able to complete the setup. Now the only other problem I had was with the controllers which I was able to find a workaround from someone on the steam forums. I have to connect them to the computer with the USB and them immediately disconnect them, that seems to work. There's a firmware update for them which may solve that little quirk, but I haven't gotten around to doing it yet, I'll update if anything changes.Once I had solved the issues and gotten everything going, the first time I saw the headset light up it was like all my Christmases came at once.As I said up top, the experience is amazing and definitely worth the aggravation. Just know going in that you'll probably have to do some problem solving to get it going.TL;DR Awesome system if you can get it running

I bought this after they announced the pro, got a like-new one for $350. Not sure about full price but definitely worth what i paid. Plus ""like-new"" came with void sticker intact. All the games feel like demos, short, some are really well done and worth the money if you can afford it. The rick and morty game was fun, subnautica is cool, echo arena is a blast if you can get re-vive to work, i expect you to die was fun but short, beat saber is amazing but short, although the moding community has shined brightly on it, keep talking and nobody explodes is a great party game. Setup was pretty simple if you have a screw driver and a step stool. Make sure you have enough room and no lights or ceiling fans near by. I cracked my plastic lampshade playing arcade saga.

Many say that Vive is superior to Oculus, but you know, I think we have a cats v dogs situation. Vive: Tracking is great. The controllers feel like baseball bats. FOV feels a little wider, but the fresnel rings are miserably distracting. Software support (Steam) is much better for now. Tracking space is much larger for physical stuff, but who wants 15’ of cables strapped to their head? There are fewer cables to the computer, but another external power source for each device involved.In short, they are both pretty great, and they both have issues. My main complaints with Vive are the lens rings and the Road Warrior vibe to the design. If you are wrestling with whether you should get either, get one. In my opinion, if you are wrestling with *which* to get, Oculus is more comfortable in many ways.

TLDR: Basestation failed in less then 2 weeks of use, had to pay to ship in back for repair and HTC would not supply a working one while I wait 2 weeks for the repair.Overall I've enjoyed my Vive Pro Experience.  It's my first entry into the VR world.  I added in the wireless expansion card/headset and overall spent about $1400.  Besides being overcharged for some things like the wireless headset ""adapter"" for the headset, I was still in a good place.  Then after less then 2 weeks of play a basestation failed.  Didn't fall over, or get knocked around, just failed.  Previous night worked, in the morning the blinked red LED was on.  I was then faced with either returning the entire VivePro setup to amazon (package it all up, ship it all back, etc) or having to pay to send in the basestation for repair, without an offer to send me a working on in the meantime.I have to say that dropping $1400 did lead to expectations of far better build quality and customer service.  I'm happy to put money into the VR ecosystem because when it works, it's amazing and I want to support hardware and software developers.  However HTC is making it difficult to recommend the setup to others if the hardware is this prone to failure and they simply do not have an interest in supporting their customers with a higher tier of customer service.

Love the vive, great product. Everything works perfect.The only reason they did not get 5 starts is viveport (their online brand specific game store) would not send any account confirmation to my email. So I made a secondary email, everything went through. All good I thought, then once I clock on the link to sign into viveport, it takes me to a blank webpage saying “error, Grant not approved” and no matter what I did, even through live support. Nothing changed that. So I will use steam as my main supplier for games which isn’t the biggest problem. But for $600, I’d expect their proprietary library system to work.

This is my first venture into VR, and in general I find my self frequently oscillating between being very impressed and very disappointed.This gear is well made, well throughout, comfortable, and tracks very well. That said this kit is take a bit of knowledge and effort to get working well.Aside from this gear, VR overall is still super immature. There are not that many good/finished/polished games, the pixel density on all of the headsets is to low, it is easy to get motion sick, and there is no eye tracking.Realistically it is going to take at least a few more years for the hardware and software to get to the point where it is actually easy, immersive, and fun.

The Good:When the Vive works, it's amazing. The controllers are comfortable in your hands and the way that it tracks your movement is usually spot on. Thoroughly enjoyed the roomscale, really provided a greater sense of immersion than I've experienced in games before.The Bad:I personally encountered problems with my Vive that were unable to be resolved, otherwise I would probably still own one now.Had the Vive for roughly a month, at first my Vive worked fine, but within a few days I started having problems with the trackpad not allowing me toclick on the right side. But otherwise the Vive still functioned as it should. After roughly 2-3 weeks, the vive began having tracking issues where it would seem as though I was drifting away from my hands, and the HMD would regularly flash to grey. Tried troubleshooting it on my own for several days, repositioning sensors, updating drivers, etc. But ultimately ended up returning it and replacing it through Amazon.The replacement Vive had the same issues with tracking right out of the gate. So I decided to troubleshoot it further, chatting with HTC's tech support for hours trying to solve this.They were very friendly, but ultimately had no solution other than sending it back in. I tried moving my computer to another room, removed any reflective surfaces, and even reformatted the computer at one point trying to remove any possible software conflicts. After all of that, the replacement never functioned as it should.I figured at this point I've either received 2 Vives that may have suffered from a similar defect, or there is some other hardware/software conflict that neither myself or tech support were able to resolve. My PC met the required specs (i7, GTX 970, 16gb ram) and the original Vive was able to run games just fine for a few weeks. As much as I wanted to keep the Vive, I wound up returning it and purchasing a different VR system and have not encountered the same types of issues yet.

As seeing the new Index coming out I can just buy a brand new Oculus for an extra $100. My controllers came in practically defective because one light drop and the trackpad refuses to go left. After that I contacted support and they told me they'll repair them for $100. If you look at replacement controllers they're $110 or so.On top of everything the headset sometimes refuses to connect since the software was obviously rushed or just completely un-thought about. It's a great device but if you're going to spend any money on a VR, just buy the Oculus. The Vive has been proven to be the superior headset over time but considering all the problems I have and the lackluster of support it makes me want to grab it by the chord and slam it into the ground.

Other then that, for the actual product its self, Its amazing and very addictive. My only slight issue that I have with this product is the resolution. I wish it had a higher resolution so that the pixels wasn't show noticeable. When using this product I experience little to no motion sickness.

So i've had the VIVE Pro for about a month now and I have to say, for me, it was worth the price to upgrade from the original.I have had the original VIVE since launch. I will say that because of the comfort increase, I have started using the vive MUCH more than I used to. Not only that but setting up the light houses was quite a bit easier as you no longer need the long 20 ft cable connecting the light houses that used to be required.The only reason i'm not giving the VIVE Pro 5 stars is because of the price. Like I said, it was worth the upgrade because i am using it a fair amount more, and I get good worthwhile use out of it. But, given the small upgrades in comfort and display/set up - I don't think those things justify the cost. The VIVE Pro should be the default vive package and should be priced accordingly. It feels like a more consumer friendly product overall. I don't think many people will consider it a good buy at this price point, and unless you have some extra money to burn I would recommend getting the original vive and just purchasing the aftermarket head strap/built in speakers.The only negative thing outside of price I have to say is the quality on the headphones isnt' as good as my normal headphones i use on my PC. The fact that you can't easily replace them via an audio jack is disappointing and an oversight in my opinion.  While not a deal breaker, it just lowers an experience that was elevated in every other regard.

The HTC VIVE, a great product that introduces you to what Virtual Reality is really like. I purchased this back in March of 2018 but of course the review didn't come in until I got the full experience, enough for the constructive criticism at least.So, the HTC VIVE, a fantastic product, a product that gives you an experience that many consider it something you cannot explain until you try it. I read that line everywhere before purchasing this and I feel like that line is 100% accurate.  It's another world, there are so many games to play and so many things to try. It's a great experience overall.The HTC VIVE is great with family, especially with the elder part of my family, they get so fascinated by the ""realistic"" feel and their faces and how amazed they get when they try it on and play a game on it is so satisfying to see for some reason. For sure a very enjoyable past time when you're with family. I take my whole PC and HTC VIVE if we go with family, not all the times, but when I see there is a chance to take it then I will. It sure makes for a great family environment and I like making my family happy and seeing them enjoy themselves! It's the little things!Obviously the longest downtime is all the cable managing and having to unplug/plug everything and setting it all up. Especially when you have to calibrate where the floor is or your room scale repeatedly. At first it may seem like a hassle to determine which cable goes where and what the next step is but after doing it a couple of times it becomes second nature and isn't so much of a deal. And when you pack up remember to not leave any components... It happened twice already..All in all, for me, it has been an extraordinary experience, nonetheless for my family as well.SIDESTORY: Since I usually take my main PC which is my only PC, I've been working on a 2nd build that is also VR Ready. So eventually I will have two PCs, one home theater PC which will be a pretty strong one since it is capable of VR and I'll also have my main PC that I can leave at home.

If you're having any tracking issues make sure there's no reflective surfaces in the room it's set up in, windows will mess up your tracking as well. Once I got all windows covered tracking was perfect. I have a small head and wear glasses so the headset is a little heasy on my nose and I have to adjust a bit every so often, but my glasses fit fine under the headset and it's otherwise okay for comfort. There's plenty of free games that are entertaining enough and more and more vr games are coming out, I'd say it's all together worth the money and effort to set it up.

This was a Christmas gift for my son. It's out of this world fun! My ONLY complaint is that most people need an extra cable to hook it up to their computer. We had to wait until the day after Christmas to buy a DisplayPort to HDMI cable. I wish we would have known that beforehand, but all in all it wasn't a huge deal.

I loved it, i have a DK1 Ovulus which is pretty neat for a prototype and worked fine until Windows 10 dropped the driver for it, was unsure if getting this or an Oculus however even if the price is a little higher the best advantage is trackers and the controllers.

The Vive Pro is far superior to the Quest 2, in my opinion. I have had both and used them to their capacity. The resolution on the Vive Pro is astounding. I absolutelt love it. Down to the built in headset and comfortably of the headset itself. The mic quality is also amazing and I'm able to be heard wven at a whisper.My only issue is that one of my base stations stopped working 2 weeks after I received.

Purchased the Vive PRO.  To date, have had a base station fail.  Rest of the hardware has operated without issues.  However, the software side is poor to say the least.  Numerous issues with the sound quality with the Vive Pro.  None of the answers available online are a permanent solution.  Therefore, your nice $1200 headset with sub-par controllers tends to be more annoying when solving sound issues than ""fun"".I've spent more time troubleshooting this device for my family to where I don't have any interest in touching it myself.  The audio issues make it a complete pain in the ass.  What's worse is, these issues have been reported for quite some time without any improvement to the sound quality and reliability.For a premium home product, it's barely worth 2 stars for the frustration it's caused.  I'd launch it from my roof rather than spend anymore time on it if the family didn't enjoy it *when working*.

Setup was quick and easy and in about 10 minutes of opening the box I was in SkyrimVR and the moment I used a bow with these controllers I haven't used another weapon except in cases where I didn't bring enough arrows.

First let me say, if your headset starts going grey and losing tracking of your controllers. Switch SteamVR to beta and if on beta revert it back to pre beta. Anytime my vive starts acting up i do this and it works flawlessly again. If your base stations won't turn off, unplug them.Now on to the review. Wow nothing beats room scale vr... i own PSVR and while I'm glad it introduced me to vr it is not comparable to the vive and it's tracking capabilities.Everything is so smooth motion wise, no more resetting my play zone every 10 mins like the PSVR.Me personally the cord never causes an issue, i am almost always aware where it is and where it is in relation to my legs.Make sure to set up a nice 6x6 foot area to really enjoy the play space. You gotta be able to lay down for games like onward.Got this with a 100$ amazon GC and the DAS.

I had tried out the Vive and loved it. I ended up getting it after a few months of debating about it. The lack of a AAA title doesn't deter me from playing what is out there and enjoying the capabilities of what it can do. I seen the Vive Pro and while the resolution on that is amazing, the Vive is perfect. If you are nitpicking, yes, the resolution on the Vive could be better, but it doesn't take away from the experience of being fully immersed into another world.

It is a great product, but it is still overpriced. VR right now is a selected audience who have a lot of money to spend in order to get this working. I returned it because I don't want to spend money on games that I will never play. Most of the games available are games I never heard of and have no reason to play. There are only a few triple-A games for VR available to play. The controls are weird for most games, like Fallout VR. Some of the games I already own have to be repurchased in order to play the VR version. The new headset that HTC came out with is twice as good as this one. I am going to wait few more years until I play Halo or Battlefront in VR.

In what little time I’ve gotten to try this, the HTC vive blew my mind- the accurate tracking and intuitive games were a new tier of gaming I had not experienced elsewhere. Though every single headset I’ve gotten (in new condition) was glitchy, prone to overheating, and could only function for 30 minutes max before being rendered unusable by TV static, crossed eyes, and seizure inducing flashes of light. I’ve tried different computers, different chords, and taken every possible step to correct these problems to no avail. I want to love the Vive, but the poor construction is making that very difficult.At the time of this writing, I’ve ordered a THIRD (and final) replacement. I WANT this to work, but I’m getting sick of having to send these back.

Constantly having issues with the base stations which renders the entire thing useless. What are the base stations doing? Well, let's start with they are permanently mounted 14' 4"" apart with no obstructions between them. When I plug them in and start Steam VR everything is good and syced up. Within minutes the base stations go from green (synced) to white, to blue, to purple and they just keep changing color. I've had this less than a month and will be working on returning it.

I got the system when is was on sale (still very expensive!). I do get motion sickness very easily and is always hesitant about VR. For this headset I have no issue with motion sickness.I was a little disappointed that the set did not come with the wireless adapter (thats is extra $$).I did try PS4VR and it just simply is not comparable quality wise. PS4VR is a lot cheaper, however does not do room scale tracking, and gave me motion sickness on same game I would play on the Vive Pro. It should be noted that we have plenty of space at home and we track at least a 6ft x 5ft area for play and run on a NVIDIA 1070 Ti graphics card with other beefed up components.Some people mention tracking issues, for me I never had any issue with tracking playing a well constructed game. It should be noted that I set my Vive Pro up in a theater room with dark walls and no reflective surface or open windows.All in all a very solid VR system. I would recommend to anyone with a disposable income and enough space to get the benefits out of the room tracking system.

You need a decent sized room where you can move furniture as needed. Once it's set up (which took us a night and a morning, because we got too tired) it was a breeze after that. It was great and fun, but the wires got to us. We decided to return it and wait to get the cordless set up. For the price and if you don't mind wires, this will do just fine.

The Vive is an actual game changer. I am very prone to motion sickness like I can get sick on a normal car ride and I can play for 6+ hours with no feeling of sickness. I will say you can notice black lines between the pixels on the display but it's also very easy to stop noticing them once your in a game. You get so immurse the sometimes you forget your actually in VR and not in reality. I get so amazed with how accurate the tracking is you can sit your controllers down anywhere in tracking range and without taking the headset off grab them first try. The system requirements they list are high and you do need a pretty good system but once you have it you'll realize you can't play regular games the same without disappointment.

I'll start with the only negative which is you must have a good computer to run it on. My son the gamer did so we were lucky. It crazy to use terms like go in and come out when talking about a video game, but that's how we all talk. When you come out it's crazy that the whole experience just happened in the living room. I'll leave the games to some one else but we have found something for everyone. My wife could just draw for hours, kids love to shoot, and love popping bubbles to my favorite song. No words can truly describe the games and worlds, you just have to experience them. As for motion sickness, my biggest fear, no one in the family has had any issues. I believe it's due to the fact we are up walking around and not sitting in a chair. We love it!

Easy setup! And I mean easy, everything is explained in as much detail as you could need, and even if you don't read the instructions it is pretty easy to see how to set it up. I was playing my first VR game in under 20 minutes. Build quality is great and everything is super comfortable. The only issue I have had is that when setting up the room, you have limited choice about your orientation, and if you don't plan for that you might have some weird cable management to do.

works great. Not enough software compared to 2D. Yes, if you harp on it you see the screen door effect, but it works find. SteamVR software is more of an issue. It frequently seems to miss the base stations being online, requiring reboots. The Cables connect to a box whih also contains the bluetooth signal for the system. This requires the occassional power cycle to bring things online and working correctly.Sweat... yes, sweat is the enemy of VR headsets. Consider additional mask covers etc if you play a long time.

The return and replacement process was hassle free, quick, and no questions asked. I've since received the replacement, issues free. The Vive creates an incredible virtual reality experience that allows you to move about a pre-defined space, it's highly responsive and an experience that is hard to describe but absolutely addictive. The setup is easy and walks you through step by step instructions. I'm very pleased with the product, highly recommend this to those considering.

It was well packaged and nothing seemed damaged, also everything worked correctly. But, I found out that there was a dead Pixel in the HTC Vive's right screen, but at least it is almost on the border of the screen so it's not noticeable in-game unless I look for it, and this is not damage from the packaging but from factory. I could claim my guarantee but to be honest I don't want to go through the hassle of dismounting everything/sending it to repair.So a great way of getting one as easily and quickly as possible.

Hardware:+Love the system+Excellent Tracking+Very ergonomic and comfortable controllers+ Easy to set up and play-Headset doesn’t stay on well when looking down (unless it is tightened to the point of giving me a headache)-The controller’s touchpad stopped clicking correctly within 20 hours of playtime.I love this system. I think it is worth the money to buy it, it has gotten me way more active while still enjoying the things I love to do. Recently I have spent a lot of time in Gorn, Elite Dangerous, and cannot wait for Fallout to come out, as well as Skyrim. The mounting system included with the base stations is excellent, and the only thing I can complain about the hardware is I had both controller’s touch pads stop clicking correctly, and the Cord for the headset seems to short when you consider the maximum play area. I was unlucky enough to have both controllers touch pads become hard to click in some areas. I have not dropped them, I have not sat on them, no damage was done that should have caused this. I will have to pay to ship it to them, but the second support person I talked with was very helpful and explained everything well.Software:+App for your phone to get notifications+Will track most VR games from steam as well, and will add shortcuts to steam if you buy a game on Vive’s platform.-Everything else about the Vive software.I am curious why they have their own game hosting software for the Vive when they work so closely with Steam. Theirs is clearly not as polished, it is hard to navigate, and even harder to find good games on without a search bar. The subscription service is a good idea, but where I would much rather buy a game outright than rent it I will probably never touch that. I would much rather go through steam just so all my games are in one place (Why Tilt Brush!!!)

EDIT: Finally got through to a supervisor through a phone call, who provided Amazon credit toward a purchase of the Deluxe Audio Strap. Wish this could have been resolved through the multiple attempts at chatting/emailing.-------There is nothing wrong with the functioning of this sytem itself. I am leaving a dissatisfied review in light of absolutely horrendous customer service from Amazon for this order and to warn others to consider ordering directly from HTC. I purchased the HTC Vive Virtual Reality System + Deluxe Audio Strap during the Black Friday package deal. Upon opening the shipment on Christmas, I found that the audio strap was missing. Over the course of multiple days trying to correspond with multiple Amazon personnel, re-explaining the issue, including being told I need to call the manufacturer (HTC confirmed that this is not a manufacturer issue - it is the responsibility of Amazon to get their shipment right), their only solution on multiple counts is to replace the order with another HTC Vive Virtual Reality System WITHOUT the audio strap. I don't understand how they think that solves my problem. Extremely disappointed at the failure to take responsibility for their mistake and make it right.

I have used generic phone based VR systems and didn't want to bother with the limited PS4 VR so I have had my eye on the Vive for a while now and it did not disappoint! It's fairly easy to set up the sensors and the software downloads, installs, and walks you through the calibration process in an easy to understand way.The experience is amazing and once you have had a few hours in your games the controls become very intuitive. I've seen some people complain about the headset not completely blocking out the light but for me it was a sliver at the bottom that did not take away from the immersion of the game and was actually a benefit so that every once and I while I could tell where I was in the room lol.I highly recommend the Vive.

Overall the picture quality is worse than the original vive because the sweet spot for viewing the center of the lenses is smaller than the vive.

I'm guessing it's one of the motion sensors, but now I have to deal with returning it.  Oh joy!  You would think that something that cost this much money would last more than 7 days!  NOT HAPPY!

I am a commercial pilot. I bought HTC Vive hoping to experience ""virtual cockpit"". Clips on YouTube shows very clear and sharp video, so I was sold. Two things that prevented my dream from coming thru were: screen door effect and very grainy video. It made it impossible to read the instruments. I have a monster for a desktop, according to Vive compatibility test, my desktop exceeded requirements for running HTC VR equipment. Naturally I am very disappointed. Conclusion: VR has a very long way to go.

I cannot compare this to the Rift, as I have not had the experience of the Rift as of yet. However, my experience has been mind-blowing. With the caveat that VR is in its infancy, and that content available today is sparse, there are a number of things that ARE available that showcase it's potential. There is really no way to explain the experience. You need to try it for yourself. Run to your local mall and find a startup VR gaming store that rents time. Try it there for cheap. That's the best option to truly gain understanding.This is the best I can do to describe the immersion level:When you are playing a console or PC game and your guy takes damage or dies, you are like, *sad face* ""Oh crap, my guy died."" :( But when it's YOU that is taking damage, you scream and run like a little girl, yelling over your shoulder, ""Stop Hitting ME!""

I received a headset from VRPark that didn't work from the moment I received it. I spoke with HTC support on two separate occasions and they insisted that the only possible solution to my problem was to send the headset in to be repaired. So I returned the headset and even sent a transcript of my conversation with HTC to VRPark because they insisted that it was tested and working. When they received the headset they claimed that it had no issues and that I broke a cable. I sent back the headset on the same day I received it and only plugged it in ONCE. So VRPark is charging me $115 for being unfortunate enough to purchase from them, despite my cooperation with them.

Super cool. Takes a little while to set up. The tracker mounts are tought to set up and will require a drill. Also the plastic drywall locks didn't work so great but I had some lying around that did the trick. Once the sensors are up it's pretty easy from there. The system walks you through setting every thing else with ease. The tracking is a lot better than I was expecting and the resolution of the headset is pretty solild.

If I could give this 11 stars I would. Most of the games for this aren't long and involved games like the ones you're used to, but the experience is unexplainable. I assume those are not very far off. This is still newish, so it's still a developing technology.I love Call of Duty, Witcher 3, Project Cars and pretty much anything like those and right now, my favorite VR experience has been Google's Tilt Brush. Yeah... a paint game/program. Play it and you'll see why.The $799 investment is WAY worth it. Watch some VR gameplay videos for the Vive to get an idea for what you're in for. The experience is clearer and more exhilarating than the videos you'll see though.I bought this in 6/17, so with it I've been told I got the newer Base Stations/Lighthouses and the 3-in-1 cable came with it. I have vertigo issues and this hasn't bothered me yet. I'm so happy!!I had to contact Vive support for a question and they were extremely fast and helpful.

First day was amazing! Second day I updated the firmware and everything went down hill super quick, the vive stopped working entirely and I was issued a replacement.I’ve read that valves firmware updates detect issues with the rotors and kill the device if you have those issues just so you know what’s up.. I guess I kinda get it. They would have failed over time and I got a new one within the warranty.Edit: just after a few months a tracker again broke and I’ve sense stopped using the vive because that’s some BS. The Witcher 3 is problem free and valve should get their stuff figured out.

Simply amazing. I have tried both the Oculus and the Vive, and honestly the choice is preference. Personally, I enjoy the Vive more. To me it feels more comfortable and has more features such as bluetooth, and camera for roomview which helps so much. The tracking seems to be slightly better than oculus and I prefer the controllers feel more than the oculus. The buttons and button bindings aren't as good as oculus, and many games change the controls so its not always the same buttons.

I had my doubts about it after reading all the reviews and hearing the little things that went wrong. After using it for a good three months now overall I would say that it is really good. Games are fun, the system works great and after I starting using the correct USB ports (2.0 not 3.0) most of my problems cleared up. The one thing do not like is that (and this sounds like it is just my unit for some reason) my microphone on the vive headset will not work most of the time. Windows will see it and I can see it's being used in the sound menu in windows, no matter what I try (discord, rec room, VR chat) I cannot get my mic to work consistently. One day I wake up to play and it works like charm, then the next when I want to get on to play with my friends it doesn't work and I have to resort to hand signals or some other method of communication.Overall it's a good headset and I would definite recommend it if you're looking to get into VR. Controllers are nice with a long battery and vive is very fun. Just wish there was some way to fix the mic issue however...

I absolutely love this headset! The screen door effect is hardly noticeable after Mabey 5min. The tracking is 10/10 the best and shows my real height in game better than oculus rift, and I know because I was playing rec room and people with the rift looked like they were 6'5''. Now yes there are some technical difficulties, the link box will need to be reset randomly due to tracking issues, but the gameplay is immersive, and the best VR experience i have ever had, way better than the google cardboard. This piece of equipment is amazing, and I'll be on the Vive team until something unrealistic happens like the vive somehow becomes obsolete, which will never happen in my eyes, there are more and more things coming out for the vive than the rift giving the vive the major lead in the VR race, and I'll be the supporter in this race.

The thumb pad on the hand-held controller is subject to breaking. It is covered by a one year warranty but it requires that you send Vive the broken controller at your expense and then they inspect it and determine if it is covered by warranty or not. They send you a notice of repairs that fall outside of warranty and you must pay for those repairs or they will do nothing and send you back the controller. They will not send you a controller to use in the meantime. They will not replace your defective controller with a new one. Their product is defective and they inconvenience you while they sort it out.

You’ve got to plan your wiring in advance or this will be a useless lump until the adapters, extension cords, and power strips come in. Make sure you have power where you want the sensors to go. Make sure you have plugs and adapters to accommodate the difference between your video card’s out and the HTC in.I was fine since I’m a bit of a plug collector, but It’s apparently very common to be unable to get this set up without a video adapter specific to your situation that isn’t in the box.

Its a very fun experience but as a warning the minimum specs for games maybe higher than the minimum required to operate the headset.  I found with my setup that activating the front facing camera can be a bit choppy and getting reasonable priced graphics card nowadays while competing with cryptocurrency market can prove pricey if you want to play certain games.  It doesn't come with a way to mount the tracking units so you do have to spend a bit extra to get stands or mount them to the wall.

If you know how to make fresh tech work for you this is certainly the best price of entertainment equipment you can put it your home. I'm constantly finding new things to do with the headset outside the realms of steamvr and viveport. With the right software you can turn your desktop into a 3d movie theater and invite other vive users to sit in on private screenings, with the same software you could set up a living room and just chat with someone or even help troubleshoot a remote computer, you could emulate an oculus rift and expand your library to include rift exclusive titles (dirt rally is intense!), and you can even play non vr supported games in stereoscopic 3d and even try out some experimental head tracking in games like Skyrim, portal 2, and fallout 4 (which is anticipated to have native support soon). I sincerely hope more people take the plunge and purchase this technology because without people buying and showing interest, there's no chance for future generations of vr headsets. It's already impressive but it can get even better given the opportunity to grow.

The VR form the HTC Vive Pro is probably great, I don't know yet. During the initial setup I noticed that one of the base stations was making an annoying whining sound. Contacted HTC Vive support via chat and was told that I would need to send in the defective unit. However, I was told that I would have to cover the cost of shipping. HTC only reimburses shipping cost if their support staff determines that the unit was indeed defective. How does HTC define the word defective? Will they say that I opened the box like an idiot and blame me for the damage? I have already spent alot of money on this and they assume I will continue to pay, which is true and is most likely the reason they get away it.  At this point I don't even know if I want to finish the setup, I don't know if the rest of it is broken too. Maybe I'll use the Vive Pro to virtually weigh down papers. Maybe virtual reality is just as good with one base station, I doubt it.I will update this review in fifteen days or so, when my repaired base station is returned.For HTC, if you find this review to be defective and feel that it should have been a five star review. Please send your defective review to me via the post. If I deem the review to be defective, I will reimburse the shipping cost and return an amended review.

I will warn those of you new to VR, playing games that have motion controls/allow for roomscale play will make you sweat a lot more than you think. It is unavoidable regardless of headset. Only solution is to have 4-5 fans(ceiling, tower/standing) in the room to help circulate cool air and moisture wicking clothes.This is a fairly good starter set. Tracking is robust, the headset is able to achieve a snug, but not strangling fit very easily, controllers are lightweight. Sure a wired setup may not be ideal, but it allows for a large library(Steam and Viveport). Installation of base stations can be hard if you are A) short B)bad at using power tools C) low on patience.Only improvement would be a moisture wicking face gasket. This would not only improve player comfort, but do so in a way that puts it far above other headsets.

The first real consumer friendly virtual reality headset and boy is it amazing, having tried both I'd put the Vive miles ahead of the oculus, the tracking is better (and being able to move around a room is amazing, though does take up space) and the Vive motion controllers (that come with the system instead of ordered separately!) are much more intuitive for VR gaming and feel better than the oculus touch controllers.The first generation of VR isn't perfect though, you will require a very beefy PC to use this device.  In addition, the field of view is noticeably limited with black space on the sides of your vision (however a properly immersive game can get you so involved you don't even notice it).  Lastly the resolution does make small text hard to read and lacks fine detail. But for the first generation of consumer VR headsets it's the best you can get right now.

The HTC Vive really does live up to all the hype. When I received my Vive, everything was packed perfectly and shipping was fast. When I got it out of the box I expected some sort of huge set up with a plethora of complicated cords going every direction and it's not at all that difficult. To my surprise setting up the 2 tracking cameras couldn't be more simple, the directions make it all too easy. Setting up the headset is a little harder, but still not difficult. Once it's all set up, plugged into your computer, and powered it will quickly install some software to help you get into it. Setting up the play area using Steam is super easy and takes no more than 10-15 minutes, max. Once you have that all set up playing games is as simple as clicking play through steam and putting on your headset. You can also use the Vive to start games. The 2 controllers are very durable and hold an impressive charge, as well as charging very quickly. As far as video quality, you may have to adjust the lenses to your eyes, but once you do, video comes through crystal clear. In summary, the HTC Vive is an amazing experience, combine that with an insanely simple set up and high quality parts put into the product and you have one amazing piece of technology. It's like nothing you've experienced before and it'll have you coming back for more.

Why are you reading a review when you could be buying your Vive? This device changed the way I play games, and I am now more excited than ever for what the future of gaming holds. I tried out a Vive at a convention for the first time and knew I had to have one. VR is worth the price and then some, really. You will see and experience things you only could in VR (including motion sickness if you get too wild) and more people should get into it. I HIGHLY recommend using Steam's free VR Compataibility tool so check how your PC will handle VR beforehand, as you may need to upgrade your system a bit. But again, it is SO worth the investment.

One of my tracking base stations died after a week and I sent it in for factory repairs over a month ago and still haven't gotten it back. The three times I used it was really fun unless I turned my body at a certain angle then the screen went greyish/blue every time making room-scale games virtually unplayable. I would give it 5 stars if there was a bit more quality control in this product rather than them telling you to do a factory reset that removes an update where the base station can detect internal issues every time you try and contact them about it and when you finally send it in they take over a month for repairs.

Great fun for a couple days but then the magic wore off. Most games are ""early access"" which means they are unfinished and provide only a minimum of playtime, essentially just a demo. The ""wow"" dazzle-factor wore off after about a week and now I've essentially got a gaming system without many games available. Other games are way expensive for what you get - developers are definitely charging early adopters a premium.

Highly immersive. It's easy to forget that you're in VR. The games are all right, but for now they all largely fall into 5 categories: Minigames, tech demos, horror, social (Like VRChat), and porn. AAA titles and other full games are few and far between for the time being, for now, the best one I can think of is Fallout 4 VR.You WILL need a powerful PC. If you have to sit down and ask and wonder if your PC will be strong enough for VR, do NOT buy VR. Invest in a stronger computer instead. I would also recommend you have some room to move around in, at least a few feet wide area.All that being said, it's an incredible experience, you get a point of view no one else gets. Minecraft in VR? You can do it. Amazing porn? Does it. Social games? How much more social than can you get than staring directly at someone in VR? Only way to get ""more"" social is by literally meeting up with them in real life.So if you have a few hundred dollars burning a hole in your pocket, and already have a very strong PC, I highly recommend it.

I have used this system on rare occasions with my family. maybe four times for a day at a time. Just recently, one of the base stations stopped tracking with a 10009 code. Customer support wants 90 bucks to fix. It is a known issue that happens apparently, I found out, after I did some digging around. I am disappointed that I ever bought an item that could have been great, that is more than likely made with cheap parts. I would expect a third party vehicle water pump to last a year, not something that is supposed to last. One year is not acceptable.

We finally took the plunge and purchased a VR system! It is a birthday present for my son and he is paying half of the cost.After researching the Vive, Oculus, and PSVR, we decided on the Vive since it seem to allow for the most immersive experience AND my son's computer was VR ready!  If it hadn't been, we probably would have purchased the PSVR since having to buy both the Vive and a new computer would have just been too expensive.Setup was easy  (at least my son didn't seem to have any problems).  We had to move a few items out of the living room and we took the blades off the ceiling fan (sounds extreme, but it was worth it).If I could only use one word to describe the Vive VR experience it would be ""incredible."" I had no idea the technology had advanced to this degree. You actually feel you are in the 3D environment of the game. My first Vive experience was when my son put the headset on my head and I was standing on the shoulders of the robot in Muv Luv looking up at the sky and then at the 3D robot I was standing on. It was an unbelievable moment. A few minutes later we were in Google Earth and I was inside the Colosseum in Rome!We have played the following games with no glitches:  Raw Data, Google Earth, Tilt Brush, The Lab, Muv Luv, Serious Sam: The Second Encounter, Richie's Plank Experience, and Destinations. My son did change some settings within a couple games to keep them from crashing--but with the few exceptions listed below things have gone well (we've only had the Vive for three days).We can't get the sound to work on Everest VR, and Star Wars Trials on Tatooine.  We also had some problems running Irrational Exuberance: Prologue (it keeps flickering).  Otherwise, everything has worked smoothly.We've also purchased some games that have been recommended as good workouts (Audioshield and Holopoint), but I haven't had time to try them yet.If you have the money and want an incredible experience--I highly recommend the Vive!

I have been on the fence awhile about VR but when I finally decided to jump in I'm glad I did and it's worth every penny! Do yourself a favor and get the pro audio head strap on day one. If you are thinking about getting a VR headset for the first time just do it you won't regret it. Granted it's not where the community would like it to be but it is as close to Future as you can get!

Overall I am very pleased with the product. It provides performance in line with or superior to competing products. I must take issue, however, with the claim that it can be used with conventional prescription eyeglasses. As I almost exclusively wear contact lenses, this is a minor issue for me. When I am forced to wear conventional glasses, however, it is simply not practical to use the Vive headset. For people who wear glasses rather than contacts for day-to-day use, I would say that renders this product all but worthless. I am not aware of any competing product that addresses this problem better, but it is nonetheless a fact. Glasses wearers beware!

Was worried my cheap gaming rig would require upgrades. Luckily the Vive runs every game flawlessly with EVGA GTX960 SSC and i7 4790 in a cheapie MSI Z97 PC Mate motherboard. At first I was a tiny bit disappointed by the grainy textures and low-res text but you forget all about that once you're in a game. Was thoroughly surprised at the level of physical exercise this thing can provide. Free content is pretty good, multiplayer is pretty good. Good stuff.

Bought it, use it, love it.  Its better than: PSVR, GearVR, Cardboard.  It is comparable to Occulus Rift.  It does room scale well.  Tracks well.  This is something which is real expensive, but worth it if you want a quality VR experience.  Does not Jitter and lose track like the PSVR.  Room scale tracking is on a different level than the GearVR and Cardboard.  The touch controllers are larger than I thought, they seem much smaller in the videos I've seen, and I now assume those people all have huge hands (or I got small ones).  Still works beautifully though.

Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut it's completely tolerable I've noticed games where I don't even notice the screen door effect and then I've had games where I can only notice it so it just really depends on you and that day and the game

Basically, no complaints (well, maybe the price..). I've had the Vive for about a month, and this thing has exceeded my expectations. The realism and immersion of the Vive's room-scale VR is so good that it's almost disturbing. At one point, exhausted from swordfighting a skeleton in Vanishing Realms, I leaned against a crate (that didn't actually exist) and fell onto my living room floor. This is what virtual reality should be -- the closest possible thing to having a holodeck in my apartment. Yeah, it's expensive, but it's cheaper than a single plane ticket to Europe, and considering the range of experiences it's capable of providing over its lifetime, it's arguably a better value.

Been using the HTC Vive with little issue since July 31.  I typically play Beat Saber and Thrill of the Fight a couple times a week for no more than an hour each session.  Started the system tonight to find multi-colored vertical lines with a white background in the left eye piece.  The right eye seems to be working with no issue.  A couple system restarts and reconnecting all output cables failed to correct the issue.  Headset software is also up-to-date.While Thrill of the Fight is a sweat producing game, I've taken precautions by wearing a head band and ensuring excessive sweat does not build up on the inside of the unit.  HTC has been contacted for support.Very frustrating...

I won't lie... it's not perfect. When i got it, I found a dead pixel in the screen which irritated me to no end, so I got it exchanged for a brand new one through Amazon (thank you amazon). HTC customer support had some English problems like grammatical errors and misuse of idioms, but I got the point, and was walked through how to initiate the exchange through Amazon where I could keep my vive until I got the replacement which is nice. I got the replacement in three days and was able to return it in the same box. At first, I had no technical problems, and games ran flawlessly, but one day, the bios had an error while booting and after I eventually fixed it, the games no longer ran without problems. It constantly says the application is running too slowly, and it would run at about 90 (when it was in the hundreds), but it would drop frames on occasion which it didn't before, and sometimes it only renders every other frame and gives me a splitting headache almost instantaneously. As per tracking, it worked fine most of the time, but on occasion, a base station simply would not work and would require several restarts and a bunch of fiddling to fix it. In addition, when playing some games where I was prone the controllers would drift away in the game off into space and would require turning off the controller to reset its position. I got several accessories like the face cover, the stock, the stands, the eye cover, the protective frames, and skins, and I just want someone who buys this to know that it cost quite a bit of money, and I recommend buying a game with a long storyline to maximize your money because most of the games are simply short. I would buy multiplayer games too, but the thing I wish I had been told the most is that the screen door effect is very real. When I booted up into that white tutorial room the ""gaps"" between pixels are obvious. Meanwhile, in dark rooms, it's barely noticable. When I first tried a rift at sxsw two or three years ago, I played a space game where I just thought it was a cool effect, but I know now that it's just something you live with. I later tried an Oculus again at a demo after I bought this, and I noticed no difference between the magnitude of the screen door effect. In addition, it can be difficult to read text, especially at long distances, in fact, I would go so far as to say that you should avoid games with snipers because your simply not going to be able to discern their body at a distance, but on the upside, you are able to hide, and everyone is on the same level playing field except those noobs on rifts. I think that even with all of these problems, it's immaculate. I have not played a normal game since then, and I play more indie games than I usually do. And if anyone thinks that my problems are due to my rig your simply wrong: I7, 32GB RAM, R9 390, and it runs DCS (a flight sim) with five monitors at 60 fps.EDIT: make sure you have a cloth or rag to get sweat off it because it will mess it up.EDIT: mine died and from what I've read people have said that htc is not covering damage from perspiration which is listed as covered by the limited warranty! I talked to square trade and it sounds like they will pick up the tab if htc demands payment but I tell you it is ridiculous! Also for those who buy the vive that you agree to arbitration unless you send them a notice within 14 days that you don't.This should allow those who get screwed by vive to take your case to a small claims court and get reimbursed for the costs you pay if this happens to you for them not honoring the warranty. Also get accident protection insurance on your vive Amazon only shows standard protection on the items page which is very underhanded of them!EDIT: so it took about two weeks for the headset to get shipped back. When they originally got it, I received no confirmation (other than from UPS which I paid for) and I got no update by email, so I took matters into my own hands and emailed HTC customer service. To this day. I have received NO REPLY. The headset was sent to the Huston repair center, so of course I should expect some delays, but should I really expect NO CONFIRMATION? Anyway, I created a forum account and complained on there (I believe its on the tech support section). The people over there who managed it where much more helpful. They weren't able to confirm that my package was there but after two weeks of complaining that I had received no update still, they sent a brand new headset to me from a California location via UPS two day air. I am very happy how the HTC forum users were able to fix this, and I hope that they will fix their broken repair process. Until then take care of your Vive like it's your only possession! Anyway... Thanks for reading.

The only drawback on this for me is I get hot and sweat while playing, even with the AC blowing on me. The most I can do is about 45 minutes to an hour. Some games will give you motion sickness as well. I only have Fallout 4 and Skyrim at this point.

It is a lot clearer. The screen door has been minimalized greatly. The Red Green Blue around the pixels has been diminished as well. Still not as clear as I had hoped. It's pretty much what I expected the Vive 1.0 to be when I bought it. I understand that hardware needs to catch up before they can come out with a better quality picture, but it is way better than the Vive 1.0 by far. All in all I am happy I bought it. Mostly the new ergonomic design is far superior I think. The only flaw I see is they should have made the headphones spring loaded to cup the ear tighter. I would recommend this over the Vive 1.0 or the Oculus Rift by far. It takes away most of everything I was disappointed in with both of them VR sets when I tried VR for the first time.

If you're looking for the best looking VR Experiences, this is as good as it gets for the next few years; however, make sure to bring your own audio device, as the built in speakers have issues, ESPECIALLY with the wireless adapter.  Wired, they sound all right via NVidia audio, but crackle and pop via HTC vive multimedia or HTC audio.  The pro is a huge bandwidth hog, so for those looking to supersample at the high end, you're going to be stuck with the wire; the wireless causes crashing.  Overall, the Pro is like Nvidia's RTX series in the sense that it is the best that one can buy, but it's overpriced for what you're getting.

This product is amazing and does exactly what it says. Ive never felt more immersed in any games or simulations more than this. I can truly say that you are shocked after every session because you feel like you were somewhere else. In the case of beat saber. Your feel like your in a cyber punk world where the only things that exists are you, evil boxes, and funky fresh beats. After doing just a few songs i take a break and when i take off the vive i get seated back into reality. Only downside is setup can be slightly annoying. The sensors dont always turn on straight away unless you just keep them plugged in forever. Depending on your system, there can be sudden drops in fps and can be really off putting to the user if it persist(just restart application at that point). But overall is definitely worth the price and there is no rush to get any vr games as there are plenty of free alternatives on steam.

While costly, this has been the best money spent all year. Bought from Amazon because Amazon always takes care of customers, as opposed to all the problems reported with shipping and support from the OEM web store.No problems, arrived triple boxed. Set up in an hour or less. Roomscale VR is the biggest wow factor since the transition from DVD to Blu Ray. And it doesn't wear off over time.Many new releases are now coming forward supporting the Vive, and I find the full immersion in horror titles to actually be downright frightening (and I don't spook easily).Steam has wonderful integration. You add your own headphones which is a plus since many will have varying preferences - over ear, on ear, in ear buds, cheap, expensive... you get it. The head mounted display has a Mic built in which I didn't figure out for almost a month. The front facing camera is a very cool option to have.I initially played it on a Radeon R9 290x with acceptable experience.  I since swapped in a GTX 980ti, and once I enabled supersampling the extra horsepower of the 980ti came into play.With amazons return policy you can't go wrong here folks. I seriously doubt you will want to return it after experiencing it though.I didndemonthe Oculus Rift at the local retail store and the tracking area is extremely limited compared to the Vive. The touch controllers maybe a little more intuitive except if you are playing a game that makes good use of a trigger grip button such as shooters. Overall I believe the Vive to be the superior kit from build quality to technical engineering.There is an extremely supportive and enthusiastic group over at /r/vive on Reddit with constant news, pre release games, and folks happy to help if you run into problems.

The HTC Vive is an amazing product! This beautiful beast represents the very pinnacle of human engineering, at least in the consumer electronics sector.The Vive is THE premium VR experience on the market. The motion tracking is flawless, the picture is as crisp as anything with the exception of the newer Vive Pro.  Now that I own one, I will never prefer another headset brand! Keep up the good work HTC, this technology is the future of entertainment! As a HUGE gamer, I wouldn't say that lightly!

The HTC Vive website describes this VR system as ""POWERFUL IMMERSION"" and has ""stunning graphics"". It doesn't mention the fact that the stunning graphics look like they are being viewed through a screen door.  It's called the ""Screen Door Effect"" or (SDE). And there is nothing that can be done about it.  Google it before you make the decision to shell out the big bucks for this. You'll find a lot of talk about it on Google but you won't find anything about it on the VIVE website.

It's good, buy a headphone headset. It works incredibly.If you don't have the eye ports centered properly then you will get headaches faster. I've got mine set perfectly and I don't get headaches even after playing multiple hours on it, but when the eye ports are askew or slightly to wide/narrow it is headache city. Take it off and take a break for 30min adjust and go back at it.The headphone headset adds rigidity to the vive that makes the headset being askew no longer a problem and then it is all about getting the eyes centered.

I love this thing. I've wanted a vr headset since the launch days and I finally got one. Needless to say this thing blew me away in the short amount of time I have had to spend with it. Here's a list of some pros and cons.Pros: awesome experience, great library, pretty easy setup through steam.Cons: price (of course, I spent something like 2k on everything including a machine to run it), the pad on the front soaks up sweat like a sponge and I am having issues with it fogging up, doesn't stop me from having fun though.

Being a owner of a previous HTC Vive I can say this is a pretty decent step forward in both comfort and quality. The screen isn't a massive upgrade over the previous Vive but it does increase the clarity mainly with text and image sharpness as others have stated. The screen door effect has been noticeably reduced by the resolution as well.For the straps It has a nob on the back which adjust the horizontal tightness of the headphones while the vertical tightness is adjusted by a single strap and the cushion on the back is pretty comfortable.Now for my verdict on the headphones. They sound good (they do not have an overwhelming bass and the mids and highs are decent which I like) this is coming from someone on a HD 700 that's plugged into a high end amplifier from Burson audio (tldr together over $1200 headphone sound system.)Lastly for those who wish to know I'm on a i7-4790k and a GTX 1080 (not a Ti) and it pushes this fine without issues.All of this being said it's easily worth the $800 price tag that's on this system. It might take some work setting it up at first as mine gave me some trouble. However now that it is setup I absolutely love it. If you wish to go straight to the Pro I recommend the bundle rather than buying the regular Vive and then the Vive Pro since you will get the gen 2 accessories. Also if you need help with the setup or have some questions feel free to ask.

Trying the Vive for the first time was and will always be a truly amazing experience, it's something you can't describe. It's something you show to others. Past all my praise, make sure you have a big place space so you can truly walk around and a TON of USB ports, if you want to upgrade with other parts (i.e. Full Body Tracking). Compared to others, the Vive  has the best resolution in the headset itself. Though unlike Oculus, the controllers are bigger and don't have built in headset. (They do come with earbuds though.) One more note, make sure your computer is VR Ready. The biggest let down is when your getting ready to try VR for the first time and then learn that your PC Setup simply can't handle the awesome power of the HTC Vive. 5 out of 5 stars for me because of the amazing experience.(Note: Not a pro gamer nor do I have any experience with the other VR headsets. So take my review and judgement with a grain of salt.)

Overall I'm loving the Vive and VR in general. Most of my friends have had little to no issues with it either. It's fun to play with as a group in challenges or just watching someone else try to succeed in a game.The only drawback so far has been HTC themselves. One of the lighthouses went flashing red after two weeks of use. HTC confirmed it's a known issue. Only repair option is to mail it in. This can take 4+ weeks. Meanwhile you're stuck to seated games or a 1400 dollar paperweight. Fortunately Amazon was able to ship a replacement, but it's a whole kit. HTC is losing a ton more money this way but they don't seem to care about that.

As an avid gamer sitting on top of well over 400+ games in my steam library the only regret I have is that I do not have 2 computers to run 2 of these bad boys.Having tried the PSVR and Oculus Rift I can say in the current condition the VIVE currently outperforms first gen VR gear. The lighthouses for tracking and room VR make for great if not clumsy experiences. The design could be a bit better but I can forgive them being one of the forerunners. The headset itself feels solid but could use a safety strap in case its dropped. The actual bungee/Velcro  strap that fits your head feels awkward at times and stretches when ever looking down so support on the headset feels needed. I know they have fixed this in a future hard plastic modification that is coming up but I believe should have been shipped as a standard improvement. The wands are a bit bulky and tedious and the new Oculus controllers are way ahead currently. The wires however are the worst part being a constant trip issue. Again being Gen 1 I can overlook this and there are products in the making that are promising wireless support albeit 200+ for the additions.The experience however is mind blowing. Without trying one you cant really grasp just how amazing things feel. You can forget you are in a game and sometimes will try and lean on desk or other things in game. It does have a tendency to get people sea sick as the motion is not always silky smooth as of yet and pixelation and screen sheer are evident in lower quality (bloat) games.TL:DR  An experience that will truly go beyond what you expected with minor design setbacks that are expected from any Gen 1 item

Ok, the Vive is an amazing piece of tech. The immersion with the vive (and the oculus rift w/ touch controllers too for that matter) is incredible.I have all the same positive things to say that the other reviews have already noted (extra shout out to the incredible tracking. when set up well, the vive controllers tracking is highly accurate).The product gets 5 stars. If you're thinking about getting into VR, BUY IT!Now with all that said. Let me tell you what is garbage:The setup process. This is easily the most tedious bullsh*t I have ever done. Seriously, look up reviews about it. It's that bad.First you've got to install steam (you should have this already), then you have to sign into steam then you've got to create an HTC account for some reason, then you've got to sign into that htc account for some reason, then you're kicked back to the setup process to continue. God help you if vive setup doesn't detect you've logged into your htc account because then the process can't continue. You've got to start over.Let's say the gods smile upon you this day and all the logins are detected you complete setup. Guess what? The installation has to restart steam to finish. Do you have two-factor authentication turned on in steam? If you do, restarting steam more than twice in a span of ten minutes is really annoying.The actual setup of the lighthouses and vive equipment is pretty streamlined.But then you put on the headset and you're hit with viveport, vive home and steam VR. It's not immediately clear how any of these things differ from one another. There are VR games I can buy on steam but also i can buy them in the htc vive store. Does it matter where I buy them? You'd have to take off the headset and google that sh*t, friend.Also, that content bundle promo card that came with your vive? Invalid code. Doesn't work. Known and well documented issue. Go ahead, look it up. Can you get a new one by contacting support? Probably. Should I have to spend an hour on the phone with support just to get a free VR game that was supposed to come with my  $800 VR platform after spending two hours installing and setting up the damn thing and creating an htc account when I already had a steam account? Probably not.My new blood feud with HTC aside, the VIVE itself is actually quite amazing. The screen door effect is pretty noticeable but once you start focusing on the games and not the tech, it becomes less noticeable. Also, turn up the supersampling.

Been out of gaming for 20 years or more.  This has got me back in.  A little tricky for setup, but if you're persistent and can google you can get it done.  Not for the completely clueless tech-wise individual.  Perhaps Microsoft's offering will be a little more user friendly.  But once you've got it set up it's absolutely amazing.  Just make sure your computer has the horses to run VR.  Google the performance analyzer for Steam to test your system.

So, the Vive is great. It has a couple of iffy design choices (the internal signal cable on the controllers apparently comes unplugged at the lightest force for example) and is a huge pain in the butt to set up, but when it works it's really cool. Unfortunately, it seems that HTC is a god awful company when it comes to customer support, but I'll get to that. First, what I like:The hardware is sturdy, and has a high quality feel all the way around. Overall, everything seems to be designed with a mind for neatness and functionally, and even the hefty 3-part cable tethering your HMD to your computer is as simple as possible and easy to forget about while playing games. The base stations are easy to mount and again, have a very smart design. This kind of thoughtful engineering is something I really value in a product.When everything is set up and working, the tracking and response and actual experience of the Vive is awesome. The Steam VR software is excellent. The feel and function of the controllers in your hands is top notch. There are some great games available. This all comes together to make a very unique gaming experience that really feels like a leap forward (for the first time since the N64, for me.) But alas, there are negatives:Firstly, you really need to buy the deluxe audio strap to enjoy this thing. That’s another $100(!) right on top of the bundle price that you probably didn’t think about beforehand. Secondly, HTC's Viveport software is obtrusive and awful. If you install it, it will randomly launch anytime it feels the urge, whether you want it to or not, and it’s shamefully averse to being uninstalled. Even with the free subscription, it's not really worth using. Thankfully you don't have to because Steam does all of the VR work anyway.And finally, HTC itself. I'm not sure why Valve is ok with partnering with a company that takes 3 months to respond to customer support tickets, particularly on an extremely complicated and expensive product that has their name on it. I had countless issues from day one trying to get this thing to work, and after a week of plugging and unplugging and configuring and reconfiguring and relocating and even buying new PC components (everything HTC recommends in their support database), it turned out to be a motherboard compatibility issue which they made no mention of whatsoever. A quick google search confirmed it is a common issue among Vive users with my same board (Asus z170-A, turn off auto overclock in the BIOS.) Three weeks later and I still haven't gotten any kind of response from HTC, and if the Vive subreddit is any indication, I shouldn't expect one until perhaps July. Okay.Along with the recent launch of the Vive Pro bundle with an insane $1400 price tag, I don’t have faith in HTC’s ability to be a good steward of the Vive. In the modern era of social media and outsourcing, there is no excuse for this level of customer support, especially so when your customers are shelling out $500+ for the product. I strongly believe that we, as consumers, shouldn’t tolerate these kinds of anti-customer business practices. Everything considered, it makes it a little difficult to recommend buying this thing. Unfortunately you have few choices if you’re really interested in VR, and without customers VR might die off completely. Maybe the Oculus is better, I don't know, but it's owned by Facebook so I wouldn't have high hopes there either.

From my experience with other headsets, I can say this is definetly the best performance vr headset in the market. The early adopter tax is high on this one, however if you are looking for the best immersion experience (responsiveness and resolution) today, you shouldn’t look further. I just hope they could develop something to fix the dizziness that comes from your inner ear not receiving the same input as your eyes, It really shortens the amount of time you can spend on each session.

I got this yesterday, and I was blown away! I'm a pretty casual gamer with getting some hours in every night after a long day of work. I went into this thinking its just a screen I'm putting on my face. How good could it be? I've never tried any type of VR before. Boy was I completely blown away from the tutorial alone. As soon as I put the headset on, I immediately felt like I was in a MUCH larger room then the one I was standing in. I ended up messing with the tutorial for a good 30 mins before I moved on to Arizona Sunshine with a group of 2 other friends who also got theirs the same day and who also have never experienced VR before. In the end, my friends and I ended up playing for only 2 hours (Late Night on a weekday) completely immersed when it really felt like 4-5 hours. You can work up a sweat really fast when fighting zombies. The immersion is so real, you end up physically doing things you never have done before in non VR gaming. Lets just say, things can get pretty funny in the end when we can all physically do stuff with our hands.....VR is such a great experience, and I encourage those who want to get into it with friends to definitely take the leap. You will not regret it one bit. I see a bright future in VR. Though their are some issues with the current gen of VR regardless of the headset brand.Those issues are:1. Very costly investment into a VR ready PC2. Very costly to invest in the VR system itself.3. Resolutions can be somewhat disappointing compared to 2k and 4k monitors. (Without super sampling. games can be very jaggy.)4. Very few good Multiplayer VR games that fully utilize VR to its potential. (Though their are plenty of Singleplayer VR Games)5. Price of VR games can be ""somewhat"" expensive for the amount of content it actually has.Though there are much more Pros then Cons, VR is still in it's early stage. I do hope to see many improvements as headsets are advanced in the near future. But, its a great start!!!

Let me be clear- I love the HTC Vive. I don't though, appreciate how Amazon promised Fallout VR, and I never received it nor was able to get a hold of anyone to inquire why I didn't get the code for it.As for the device, the downside of the Vive is the small window of clarity where the lenses aren't blurry to the eyes. The strap it comes with is also poorly designed and doesn't fit comfortably. For the price you're spending, it's worth the extra $100 to buy the HTC Audio Strap along with this as it upgrades the comfort level significantly, makes the lenses clearer, and has integrated headphones. Why they didn't design the straps out of the box better is anyone's guess. Overall the Vive is a worthwhile experience, but beware of the false promises made by Amazon for free games.

I bought this VR system back in August and for the 2 1/2 weeks I owned it I had a blast... until it broke.  When you play VR you will inevitably sweat because it's a full body experience.  The headsets have no barrier between moisture and their on board video card and if sweat gets in there it's toast.  It worked perfectly... I hung it on the wall after a gaming session and the next day it was broken because moisture apparently made it's way into the on board video card.  Based on how many other people have had this happen across the internet they really need to redesign the headset to be more durable and take into account things like perspiration.

I was worried this wouldn't worth the price, but it definitely is.Don't compare this system to any VR that is not used in room scale as the room scale experience totally makes it worth it's while.Don't try to use this in a space that is too small or you might in for a bad time.The software is a little glitchy, but nothing crazy.  Sometimes you have to close out of Steam VR and reopen.  Using revive I was able to use Rift games just fine.Experience can get surprisingly active.  We have had people on the floor panting after a session.  Can also be surprisingly calm, but still fun, as with the 3D painting games.The wire is kind of a pain, and I had to make a custom ceiling mounted setup to really get the full experience.  This required weighting the cable end to remove slack... which then wants to pull it off your head unless your head is the right shape, necessitating a counter weight clipped onto the user end.  Its great when it's all setup this way, but until adjusted exactly to the users preferences there are annoyances.

Mounting lighthouses and software made it ever so easy to setup. I went 15.5 ft. Distance on the lighthouses and as high as I could. Use a tape measure and it worked perfectly. When you open the main box just charge up the controllers as you install the wall sensors. When you order just go ahead and install the steam VR software. I was up and laughing with my wife in VR in 40 min. One last note !!!!! Out of the box everything had a firmware update. Check before mounting 😀

Love the system, but I wish it was a bit lighter and didn't have to be so firm against your face (causes lines/discomfort after only a short use). I also think it should come with the upgraded head strap that is sold separately (considering the price) and the third party face pads (much better than the originals as well). Overall, definitely recommend over the Rift though.

I wear glasses and thought I would get motion sickness if I played games or was in some other 3D environment, but I didn't. I can play for hours without a break. When I do take them off after a long play session it kinda makes me wonder which world is the real one.

I purchased one of these kits so I could finally enjoy VR but the headset that arrived had an issue with the IPD adjustment, causing me to feel cross eyed contantly. I thought it was just one bad kit so I sent that one back and ordered a second one. Everything else worked on the second one EXCEPT one of the base stations was constantly buzzing like a broken hard drive. If the kit worked in its entirety, I would give this a better rating but for now, the quality control is terrible for a 1300 dollar product

This technology is really going places.  The headset is a bit heavy, so it takes a little while to get it all situated and cinched to your ideal, especially if doing it alone LOL.  A bit strange with glasses on, but can't see well (even in the headset) without them.  Need to try with contacts instead... I'm totally digging it, regardless.

This is because sooner or later your going to run into technical and hardware issues. My vive worked fine for 7 months until just recently the hdmi cable went out and the headset didnt display.(error 208) This is heartbreaking because owning a vive has been the most exciting gaming experience of my life. Once you find the hardcore vr games, and you become immersed, its hard to go back to regular gaming. So i want everyone to know and beware of what your getting into and always buy your producTs NEW.

If you are spending this kind of money you should have done a lot of research about this to know exactly what you are getting. Overall the experience is great, but deffinetly do some research and watch YouTube reviews and comparisons to the oculus rift (very similar product). I bought this over the oculus because I am a valve fanboy and it has a larger max play space. The controllers on the oculus seem better, but after playing the vive I wouldn’t change a thing. As far as field of view goes, today’s virtual reality is pretty close to as good as it gets, but the display doesn’t cover your full FOV. I’d say a good demonstration for where the field of view cuts off would be placing one finger on the far edge of your eye socket (assuming you don’t have giant fingers). Aside from this, the display is amazing. The only other downside is there are a few visible lines in the lenses that you can see if you really try and focus on them. It can also be hard to read text and somethings are burry in vr. Using this device for a long period of time will strain your eyes, the lenses are literally inches from your face. Remember when your parents would tell you if you sat to close to the tv your eyes would burn out. This quite literally happens in vr. To wrap my review/rant up, vr is the next step for gaming. Playing vr is the most fun I have ever had while playing video games. If you have the money to spend and you are interested in this product... you should buy it. Ps when you buy it expect to drop another couple hundred on vr games

I then contacted them via chat, and they have insisted that there is nothing they can do other than to email them some more even though they NEVER answer. I then contacted Amazon support twice and was told that I have to resolve the issue with HTC and that there is nothing they can do.What am I supposed to do?

I love this VR headset. Roomscale is definitely the way to go and recommend it over the oculus rift (which I have used). My sensors are approx. 18ft apart which is pushing the range of the two lighthouses (one inch farther and they lose sync). This is great because my unit did not come with the included sync cable. This is a great headset to get now because it is marked way down from the original $700 and will work with the upcoming valve index controllers. UwU

This honestly has to be one of the coolest things I've ever encountered. The level of detail is superb and the accuracy of tracking is unmatched. The tracking stations don't require a physical connection to the PC which is very convenient. Unlike the Oculis Rift. Additionally 2 tracking stations are included instead of one, like with the Oculus Rift. When I found out that the Oculus touch bundle was also $800 but included only 1 tracking station and an additional one would have to be purchased separately for an additional $80 to  have accurate room scale I determined that the Vive was the better option. Also, I fell like the Vive provides a better field of view and crisper looking display. The Vive also supports a game pad with compatible games. I like the ability to use your own headphone by using the attached 3.5mm jack that come off the top of the headset. I did not find the Oculus headphones on its headset to be that immersive as you could still here ambulent sounds around you since their more of the old school design with a thin layer of black foam surrounding the speaker. Using your own headphones would require an equally long cord for room scale. The headset cord for the Oculus is also considerably shorter than the Vive's at only 6 feet. I think it's a good value, considering all the programming an R&D that went into this it's worth more than the asking price in my opinion. The HTC Vive is the obvious choice when compared to the Oculus. I'm happy with my decision to be an early adopter of this technology and hope it continues to improve over time.

Had a buddy pick up a Gear VR and it was enough to trigger this purchase.Package:  everything carefully packed away nicely.Assembly: almost none.  I mounted one lighthouse to a wall, and the other on a tripod.  They are fancier, and someone might smack me over the head for this, but this is just a really fancy, super complicated wii sensor.  I was a little disconcerted at first, since upon first plugging it in, they vibrated.  Come to find out, they have tiny motors to flash the room repeatedly to give the headset and controllers something to base their location and movement from.  Neat.Installation.  Nigh-painless.  If you already have Steam, just install Steam VR and run it.  It will guide you through initial room set-up with cute Portal-esque stick-men.  very easy.Bundled games:Zombie training: Merely OK gallery shooter, with a few extra interactives to spice it up.The Gallery: Episode 1: Call of the starseed:  THIS IS WHAT VR IS MEANT FOR!!!  It took some getting used to the controls, but after a few minutes, I forgot I was holding controllers.  Their in-game representation uses hands, and the remote trigger used to close them to grab things is pressure sensitive, so a half squeeze squeezes the hand half-way.  Not inherently useful in the game, but a great addition to immersion.  I also caught myself wading through a sewer in-game, and thought, I wonder if.... and next thing I'm laying on the ground looking up through the water.  IT IS THAT GOOD.  The use of a grabbable backpack as in the inventory system is a great idea.  you actually have to pull it over your shoulder to get to it, and then it opens in front of you to insert or remove items.Thoughts on hardware:Positive1.  Remotes last a long time: 4-6 hours2.  The headset is relatively easy to adjust, but a little more work when my six year old with her tiny head wants to try.3.  Lens distance adjustment is a great addition for those glasses wearing folk out there.  They fit in just fine4.  Comfort is good for long periods.5.  In spite of calls to the contrary, I've had nine people try this thing, and no one has tripped on the cord yet, however two drinks have been punched over because the immersion was so good, and they were just outside of the play area :).NegativeOnly one I can think of.  After about an hour, the lenses start to become blurry.  I thin it has something to do with humidity, but I am warmer-blooded than most, and a quick wipe with a cotton shirt or the included cloth clear it up just fine.

If you have a pc that can handle vr and you don't have this already, what are you doing? The htc vive offers an incredible and unique experience. You really feel like you are there in the game. One minute you are shooting bad guys with a bow and arrow and in the next you are making 3D drawings and in the next you are exploring the world. The possibilities are endless as to what you can do with the htc vive. One thing that I came to realize though is that you need space(preferably larger than the recommended in my opinion). At first I had mine in my room screwed into the walls which was great but I felt crammed and I kept bumping into the wall because I can't see them in vr. I just see open space and I want to run around and explore but space limits the amount of immersion you can have. If you have more space, it will definitely be a much better experience. I now have mine in my living room with a large space and I can have more friends over sitting on the couch without disturbing the player. Vr is an incredible experience and if you have a strong pc and can handle vr(use the steam vr tester) and spending the money won't make you go hungry for a few months, go for it!it was worth the money for me. The only complaint that I have is the slight lack of good games to play out of the box. Most of the good games will cost you extra but there are really good games. Space pirate trainer, raw data, Rec room, the lab, the diner duo, and many more are examples of some of my favorites.

This is easily one of the best purchases I've made in my life! HOWEVER a warning out there to all of you who have yet to order or receive your VIVE: IF your computer tower DOES NOT have MORE THAN ONE hdmi port (or your monitor isn't plugged into the one you do have) you need to purchase a MINI-DP TO DP CABLE! Otherwise, you run the risk of just having a blank headset without any visual input. Believe me I tried several different adapters and cables and the mini-dp to dp was the ONLY thing that worked. If you check the steam help-forums you will see that this is a fairly common issue with the VIVE and others have cited that this seems to be the only solution, so plan ahead and save yourself A LOT of stress!!!

We tried going through their customer service process for 2 weeks - and the only response we ever got was along the lines of  ""sorry for the inconvenience, we will get back to you soon, in the meantime try to solve the problem yourself.....""  It's going back.

its still in development; i don't recommend VR yet, this doesn't deliver quality image over price. get something else more entertaining for less, basically; the lens can only be view right on the center of the radio, this so call sweet point; cause moving eyes around to see any image makes it blur a lot, the pixel amount on display makes it impossible to read text on VR, you need to get close to it, to make out some of it and be able to read it. the experience is more of a illusion tricking you mind to think you are in a environment were you move like in real life, a very degrade environment pixelated, i do like the feel and the concept idea behind VR, but when looking at the devices it self, one can easily question the build HTC headset if its worth it or not, the answer i can give you in response is that its not, people don't give you a real review experience on this device, if your curious to buy one, try it first before buying it. beside having a good computer to run VR most application are glitchy, and little good tittle's are out now, not even for artist would i recommend it, not even for rich people would i recommend it, this for me is like a historical toy device and not a video game ""controller"" console, even a game boy advance would match the experience-seriously.

Bought used/opened (appears to be the only option on this page)Missing items: - Viveport Subscription (as advertised on the page at time of purchase) - Cleaning Cloth - Mounting pad for link boxAll 'necessary' components were included, but the mounting pad is crucial and I was forced to improvise a solution. It's possible that in repackaging, they simply missed the pad, as it is hidden inside of what looks like filler. Or it had been used. Either way, this should have been noted. This knocks about $15 off the value. The Viveport Subscription is an additional 6 weeks over what you would get just signing up at Vive's website. This is another $12 of value missing. Based on the price I paid, this means I got 93% of the product I paid for.

This is the future. I have zero regrets on this purchase. There is a very mild screen door effect, but it's much less noticible than the Gear VR, and I noticed it less than I did when I used a friend's PSVR. The tracking is fantastic and room scale is simply incredible. There is room for improvement in future iterations but what we have right here and now is nothing short of awesome.

It was a little fussy to set up. HDMI would not work through my R9 Nano, but was successful once I purchased a mini DP converter. Despite clearing an 8x12ft space for VR, some games will say the space is too small and advise me against proceeding. I believe I'll definitely need another Nano to help with the more graphic-intensive games.That being said, worth it. Perfect for escapists.

Blows away the Occulus! I made the mistake of buying the Rift 1st. Now I know why the Vive cost more. It is that much better.I wish I read a review like mine, before I got suckered in by the lower price of the Rift. My Rift Headset, wouldn't even work, had to send it back.Build quality of the Vive is much better, as is the Lighthouses, and they link up so much easier than rift sensors. Put it this way, as small a space as the rift limits you to, you may as well use the plug and play Windows VR (Mixed Reality) , without the sensors.  I took away a star, just because of the resolution, and screen door effect, but until the newer version comes out, it's pretty much the standard between rift and Vive. There are a few Mixed Reality Headsets, that have higher resolution, but they are not per se, full-scale like the Vive and are limited by the camera's on the headset, picking up on the handheld sensors, still pretty cool, and fairly inexpensive. I like the way Vive, interfaces with Steam, also. To me much better than Rifts separate program running on my pc, that I could not get to work properly, (google it).. Yes Steam is a program, but you will end up running it anyway, with Occulus or Vive. Vive has more Range with the sensors, longer Headset cable, not having to use a bunch of USB's for Sensors(rift), etc etc.  Just my opinion, but I would NEVER consider the Rift, after having experienced the difference..

I absolutely love this system.  There are a few tips that I would like to point out though that I think should be easier to find but I had to dig to figure out.1.  Remember you can adjust the focus with the knob on the side of the headset (mine was blurry for awhile till I checked this out).2.  If the controllers aren't connecting while setting up steamVR then update them.  That didn't work? Update them again.  I had to do this twice before they started working.Besides all that it works perfect.  The crispy movement detection and the room scaling is awesome too!  Enjoy the VR everyone, I know I am!!

Using this to play games on SteamVR. The motion tracking and response to head rotation and the controllers is extremely good, completely seamless. Setup wasn't too hard. Headset fits comfortably for the most part with some adjustments. My biggest issue with it is that you need to turn your head to look around, otherwise the display looks blurry around the edges.

I'm a 32 year old hardcore gaming enthusiast.  This is pretty mind blowing technology. It was very easy to set up minus having to drill holes in your walls to mount the sensors. It requires quite a of space. Do not  buy if you don't plan on using in a somewhat large open space or you'll regret it.  I didn't get any motion sickness or anything but some games and moving scenes threw my balance off quite a bit, it really fools the senses. I did experience a bit of vertigo after I took them off after playing for a while. The real world looked a little odd and not quite flat. Sort of felt like I was high on drugs for a little while.  The main bad thing about it is poor graphics due to low resolution and poor plastic lenses.  For this price I expect glass lenses.  It was also very difficult to adjust and get just right for a clear picture. If you have deep pockets then go fit it otherwise it might be best to wait for future versions that will hopefully be a bit cheaper and better.PS: Beware of horror games.  They're pretty damn intense and threw me off balance quite a few times lol.

I'm seriously impressed by the games and capabilities of the Vive, but as a big time nerd, setup was a disaster. It took me over 6 hours to figure out one thing while something else went squirrely. Tips: You MUST use usb 3.0 for the headset, if you don't, the controllers and sensors won't work. Also, if you have only one hdmi port on your video card, you MUST use exactly what they tell you, in my case a hdmi to DVI adapter. If you stray from the instructions in the most miniscule but still logical way, everything is going to go belly up. I had to make a special trip to best buy to get an adapter in hope that It would  help and luckily it did. One star deducted for not enough info on the Web to research prior to buying.

THE PINNICLE of STATE OF THE ART VIRTUAL REALITY.  Period.  No ifs ands or buts, this system is the ultimate.  HTC VIVE is paired with the extremely excellent STEAM online gaming company and there are a HUGE library of VR games to download of many varieties.  Simply go to the VR GAMES section of steam, download and start playing.  I have had NO compatibility issues with anything from Steam, so you know that every one of those games will work on the VIVE.  The room-scale setup is incredibly easy.  My young son and I accomplished this task in less than an hour, without a single hang upI of course bought an excellent VR-ready gaming computer to go with the headset, so in all I dropped about 2500 dollars on this setup, but for my money, I have a 15X15' gaming area,  the BEST VR system available to man, and the ability to play any game for hours with no signs of motion sickness.  Nobody who has played this in fact has shown any signs of motion sickness.  Whether this is due to the excellent VIVE headset, or the quality of my gaming computer (with an NVIDIA 1080- EVG HYBRID video card), the results are that I can play all these games with ease for as long as I like.

HTC vive, awesome hardware. Best VR on the market. Has screen door effect as all VR headsets do. I would purchase the pro version do to that. It is really a steal becouse of the included base stations and controllers. Takes a bit to fully set up correctly. Games are awesome and with revive ypu can play oculus rift games.

The software install went well. You need to download the setup from vive dot com which makes you register an account. Works seamlessly with Steam.Hanging the sensors was simple and did not require the sync cable between them. The power cord for the sensors is about 7 or 8' so you have some options with placement.I did have trouble getting the headset to work with the HDMI on my graphics card (980 TI). It took a few tries and resets. After googling, I ended up bypassing the link box and going straight from headset to card and usb to computer. That worked like a charm. (I think the link box counts as a HDMI repeater and may wig out the HDMI handshake or something.)Once it was all good to go I did the room setup and the Steam VR tutorial. Room setup was cake. Tutorial explained and trained very well.Fired up Elite:Dangerous as this was the game I wanted VR for. It is really hard to describe just how immersive it feels. I spent about 10 minutes just looking all over in the cockpit. Super responsive, no blurring and perfect tracking. I felt like I was in my own spaceship. Flying was great and combat was intense. My jaw was sore from being so tense thanks to an especially hairy fight. I was looking all over keeping track of my target and monitoring systems on my ship. I can't express enough how huge space felt and immersive the experience was.Why 3*?The 3d depth is great. Hardware is easy to setup and comfortable. BUT, the screen door effect (like looking through screen mesh at a TV) was impossible for me to ignore. I could very easily make out each individual pixel with a space between the next. It made the resolution look worse than it actually is and started quickly giving me eyestrain. Immersive, responsive 3d does not make up for a migraine. I think if I had worse eyesight it may have actually been a better experience.I wanted to love it but decided to return it. When the pixel density improves I would not hesitate to buy a VR headset again.Sidenote: I also had the audio strap accessory. If you get the Vive get the audio strap. It makes the headset more comfortable and has really nice sound.

I know some had bad experience but I have to say if you take the time, set it up correctly, then you won't be disappointed.The tracking is fantastic and with 3rd party programs you can even use oculus rift games (ReVive) or convert just about any regular game into VR (Vorpx)Has bluetooth in the connector box so you can get your text and cell call notifications while in game as well.Play is smooth. no issues, love this thing. (Just wish more complete games were out, all are early access or tech demos)Best advice--The lighthouses, buy 2 pieces of PVC (1 smaller than the other in diameter) cut both in half, place the smaller into the larger then place in corner, raise until hits ceiling then mark the spot at the larger/smaller point and drill a hole then place a pin or nail to keep it there. Mount the lighthouses at the top now you have an easily movable set up! and no holes in your walls or extra for money on brackets etc. This set up cost me $5 for the 2 pieces of PVC.

I recieved the system and it was a bit cumbersome to set up, during set up the base stations required firmware updates and the first one went fine but the second one now doesn’t power up. I’m awaiting response from the vendor on what to do, but have seen others state they have had the same issue and tried removing the firmware and reloading and still no go..

I picked this up hoping we'd finally crossed the threshold into real home Virtual Reality, something I've been chasing since the 90s when I played a system at the fair and hoping for ever since.We're close, and this is a decent system, but it has some major issues.I bought this on an impulse the day I ordered my new PC because I thought why not, I'm getting a GTX1080, Fallout 4 VR is out, lets give this a whirl. Setup is alright but it's a few steps up from plug and play, takes about half an hour and you're ready to go installing drivers and such. Out of the box it's kind of a neat experience, and then you throw up a real killer app for the first time and it'll blow you away. It really did blow me away, but one of my controllers kept drifting around and losing it's sync, I figured a firmware update would help it.I was really excited, I got back on Amazon and ordered accessories, a stand for the headset and controllers, a cover, the deluxe audio strap (which should be included stock and even though it's not is 100% worth it by the way). This thing was my baby and my Steam cart filled with apps and games to play with.The more paces I put it through though, the more noticeable the controller issue became. It was just one, it made a funny buzz on bootup, would lose sync as I walked around my room, and had a trackpad issue where near the edges it wouldn't register to touch or to clicks. Firmware updates didn't help, either did re-calibrations or tricks I read online. So I contact Vive support via email and hear nothing. I finally get in touch with someone on live chat after sending a message and leaving the window open for 38 minutes with no indications they ever got it or a queue, a response!They determine my controller probably needs to be repaired, it should be covered under warranty. Whoop! I'll be back to rocking my Vive in no time. But then they tell me, for an item that shipped defective, I have to pay for shipping it back. I questioned this, because this wasn't a six month failure it was an out of box failure, and they told me I should have bought it directly from them and they could have potentially waived the shipping costs. I found this a bit insulting, because I only bought it on Amazon as an impulse buy, had it not been for Amazon I'd of never have gotten one to begin with.They also recommended instead of going through the repair process, and this is honestly why they're losing a second star, that I tell Amazon I had buyers remorse and have them refund me, and buy a new one. Or tell Amazon it's broken if that doesn't work, and have them swap me a whole new system. Both of these are ridiculous responses for an in warranty item. Not to mention that the install for this requires physically installing things up on the wall (with drilling) which has to be undone, unwired, and boxed only to do it all again if you swapped the whole system.I just wanted my broken controller fixed.The system itself is awesome, there are some legitimate fun games out there for it and a lot of awe inspiring technical demos. Hopefully more comes soon. When it's working everything is pretty smooth immersive. Setup is kind of long but easy to follow along with, the cabling is a bit over the top, and it gets expensive when you start adding accessories to the whole mix, but when it's working it is fun. I'm removing stars for HTC support, which I'd read online already is terrible. Telling me to return something to Amazon and buying it from them again to avoid a warranty is shady. I can't imagine how bad it's going to be if one of them gives out a year from now.

It Worked amazing for 2 days and the camera stopped working. Then while troubleshooting I found out that i have to return the entire system and ask for a refund and wait (still waiting) and then re order the system. All i needed was a replacement camera and had I ordered from HTC VIVE directly i would have been able to get that instead of having to send the whole thing back. pretty disappointing especially waiting so long to actually get a chance to play VR. If you are wanting to get this system i would recommend ordering from the company directly instead of here, in case anything goes wrong you can get support quicker instead of being viveless.

After all that I had to go through to get this I would give Amazon a one star on how things started. Ordered this and the Audio strap and the System that I ordered New came to me Used and missing parts. I contacted Amazon and they sent out a New one right away. I sent back the used one and they refunded me for an Audio Strap when I sent back a System. Went through the Chat help four times and all four times I got the same answer 'Will send this to investigations and get back with you in three days.' Never heard a peep from them. Finally called and got someone that fixed this the fist time.BIG Kudos to the help people in the call system. Thank you.Now on to the System. GREAT!!! and I love it. Still awaiting for Skyrim for VR on the HTC but it is worth it. Only thing I would have loved to been able to do it have the next gen wireless system you see on the HTC web page. Would be nice to see HTC offer us wire system users an adapter to go wireless but that is for another time. Have found out you have to turn off the two IR sensors when you are not using them or they will mess with your TV and Cable remote control but that is not a problem.Now as for the HTC Vive. I love it. It makes a world of difference to playing FO4 and right now I am biting at the bit for Skyrim to come out on the HTC. I would suggest this item for anybody that wants to go to the next level in gaming.On the other hand: If you have an issue, CALL. Talking to a person in person is much faster. Again, Thank you Call Center.

This really is a great gadget for anyone that loves PC gaming. I won't delve into everything that is great about it; just give out some technical implementation and trouble information with the HTC Vive:First, the tracking sensors can be touchy. I highly recommend testing the location you pick out on the walls for mounting before actually mounting. Things like reaching up to adjust the headset with your hands and arms can and will cause sudden loss of tracking. Sometimes, when seated, and turning your head, you can get glitchy tracking results and the headset view will seem to jump around as the system reacquires tracking. This effect is similar to XBox Kinect where it cannot tell the difference between one of your arms and body, or your left from right arm. So for a split second it reports bad information to the game and there is a sudden jerking movement. This happens with the HTC Vive as the headset is facing in a semi-perpendicular direction to the ""plane"" of the two trackers facing each other, but the tracker facing direction and the location of the trackers make a huge difference in this. If you are close to one and far from the other tracker, it is more likely to happen. If your seated play area, like your desktop for playing seated game, is in the 'corner' of the overall play area, you are probably going to see this. If your desktop is in the middle of the rectangular play area (whose house is setup like this??), then you probably will never see this problem.Second, I have seen a lot written about the screen-door effect and how bad it is or if it is noticeable, bothersome, etc. Yes, there is a screen-door effect. Yes, it is bothersome for some games. Mainly, it is troublesome for games that were not made for the HTC Vive or VR specifically. A few good examples are Elite Dangerous and DCS World. Both of these games suffer from issues with the screen-door effect, where text displayed on the screen is simply not legible. In DCS World, you can see the HUD on the A-10C OK, but you cannot make out any of the information displayed on the HUD that is text. In Elite Dangerous, text displayed in menus, targeted ships, and around the HUD in general is difficult to read. In games where the design of the game has VR specifically in mind, the developers obviously make the text much larger and easier to read. If the screen-door effect was not present, the small text might be difficult to read, but not impossible. Most games built for VR don't have the legibility problem, because of the way they are designed.Third, Steam VR is not mature. There are numerous quirks and issues with operating in a mixed VR/Non-VR environment. For example, programming keyboard/joystick/controller options in a game where you need to see/use the keyboard/mouse can be a frustrating experience. Steam seems to allow launching some VR enabled games in a non-VR mode, however, even if you select this option in DCS World and Elite Dangerous, Steam VR launches and uses the headset. I have not found a way to bypass this, but I'm still working on this. Anyway, setting up a joystick for a game where you you might need to look at outside of the 'virtual world' is a mess. Usually, you end up taking on and putting back on the headset repeatedly, it is a chore. There are games where the developer has done a good job for making a setup interface work in VR (e.g. Lunar Flight, a really first class VR in-game controller setup). Another issue is that you may launch a game outside VR via the Steam application, put your headset one and discover that although you can see the game in VR just fine, nothing works. This is usually caused by the game on the Windows desktop not having focus (click on it with the mouse to get focus). It's weird, and it is not intuitive.A few other annoyances are having to adjust and re-adjust the motion tracking sensor directions and re-run the room setup frequently. The chaperone (basically an in-game grid when you get too close to the defined play-area boundary) seems to appear when I'm not really that close to a boundary. Cable management; keeping from getting tangled up or stepping all over the cables in a standing/moving VR game. Adjusting and readjusting the headset position on your face all of the time, slight changes in position, change the center of focus. Everything in the peripheral part of the view (not straight ahead) is progressively blurred and has extreme chromatic aberration (Red/Green/Blue divergence). Some VR games have altered some internal brightness/contrast/color controls, affecting the headset even after exiting the game. To resolve this, you must shut the headset down completely and restart it, this is annoying.Not annoying but interesting: Everything displayed that is designed for VR is in stereoscopic 3D and the effect is really very cool. The 90Hz scan rate is halved to 45 for this 3D, so the max FPS displayed is 45fps. This is generally not a problem.Overall, this is a great experience and worth buying into. I imagine that followup generations of this VR technology will be lighter on the head and present a better VR display, as well as being less quirky to setup and use. VR is definitely going to be the future, despite all of the naysayers. It will take time, but in ten years, VR is where first person gaming will be focused.

The Vive got right what the rift got wrong.While the rift was a seated affair, forcing it into more situations where motion sickness would occur... (thanks to not having virtual ""hands"" via hand controllers)... The Vive comes out of the box with awesome hand controllers... This means you can stand up and move freely in a space!  And thanks to its truly impressive tracking system, your head and hands lock on so smoothly that even the most sensitive stomachs will have no issues.  The engineering behind the Lighthouse tracking system is spectacularly brilliant and simple.  Wish I thought of it!At only 8 months old, the Vive has an impressive list of supported titles... Google Earth alone is worth getting Vive... Tilt Brush, Audio Shield, H3, and dozens of other titles are sure to delight.A thoroughly enjoyable experience...

I bought the Vive when I was still into the Virtual Reality hype, and for a while I was not disappointed, the game I tried out were very realistic in terms of how it spacious it felt. But the hype/excitement wore off after a bit; after really searching for games I wanted to play I came to the realization that most of the games were glorified tech demos or some just for cash grabs. The most fun I had was playing Minecraft with it because it already was a fully-fledged game and the mod made the game very intuitive in turns of game-play. Unfortunately I returned the product before I knew about the upcoming releases of Skyrim and Fallout 4 VR so I can't judge VR on those games but I still felt VR had a long way to go until it was at a very intuitive and fun way to play games; it still felt very much in a development stage.For me personally I had fun with it the couple weeks I had it but I did get nauseous after using it almost every time and the ""screen-door"" effect is still very noticeable to me. Sometimes there was some de-sync issue even though the senors were very close and the weight of the headset did get cumbersome after a while. However in the end I hope for VR to further improve in the future and the Vive is making great steps ahead in terms of VR technology but I felt as if it needed improvement.

My only complaint is the earbuds are pretty bad so if you are going to get this, make sure you also get the back part (extra $100) or have headphones handy to put on so sound is better.It’s pretty good, I wish that the back part came with it instead of having to pay an extra $100 for it, but it works either way.

First time ever using VR and I gotta say I love it! I can't really afford to travel and, while it's no substitute for the real places, being able to see places across the world in the click of a button is awesome! And don't get me strted on the games! I'll probably lose more weight, and bust my hand on walls (I have a small play area), using this thing than any work out routine!

I had been keeping a close eye on this and the Rift since they started development. Even after they were released, I watched every review and game play video I could find before I ordered it. The reviewers are right, you don't understand how great this is until after you try it yourself. It can definitely make you feel like you are in the game, I found that out when I went to lean on a wall that didn't exist in the real world and almost fell over. The only downsides I have found are 1) sometimes the controllers become unpaired when you restart the VR system and only detect and track one controller, and can be a bit of a pain to get them to reconnect properly and 2) the cable that links it to the computer is a bit short for my liking, but I knew about this when I bought the Vive. My main reason for buying this over the Rift was the full room play area that can be set up. I have been playing on this almost every free minute I've had since it was delivered and had friends over to try it out, they loved it. I would definitely buy this again and will be buying the new generations as they come out. For anyone that is on the fence about buying this, and has the computer to run it ( I'm running an ASUS Crossblade Ranger MB, Strix R9 390 video card, AMD A10-7870K processor, 16GB of RAM, Windows 10, and a 512GB SSD as my main drive, and everything runs great), I would highly recommend you get it.

Nice headset,  good graphics and performance, but the controllers ruin the experience. The controllers are awkward, fragile and poorly built.  The touch-pads , when they work, are twitchy, the directional button on the touch pads edges break easily and the grip buttons are poorly positioned where you frequently activate them unintentionally just to keep a good grip on the controllers.

I had the Oculus Rift before this who does not cater to those who wear glasses. I can honestly say the Vive is so much better than the Rift. It even has cutouts on the face pad for glasses. It adjusts away from your face to make room for bigger glasses. And overall the Vive runs a LOT better than the Rift.Games I Use It For Currently: Elite: Dangerous, Distance (beta), Tilt BrushI will be trying this out with Subnautica soon and various other games that are made specifically for VR.Con: Only one, the Vive seems to not have built in programs that help those who game and Live Broadcast (Twitch, Mixer, YouTube). There is a program a third-party company put out that does overlays during gameplay, but I haven't bought it yet. I am able to use the desktop view to see the other monitor for a second during gaming. I'd advise a notification sound when someone sends a message in chat to use the Vive for streaming in its current state.UPDATE 07/15/2018: I have returned the Vive. When compared to the Rift, the Vive outdoes it all the way. When compared to the technology of today with regards to the screen, it is a massive FAIL. In my opinion it is not worth the price tag in its current state. I will be waiting another generation or two before getting VR again.

I love my VIVE!  A few things to know before hand.  Make sure your computer can run it, your experience will depend on it.  Also make sure your graphics card has 2 HDMI ports, one for your monitor and one for the VIVE.  If you have one HDMI and display ports on the others you will need a Display port to HDMI conversion cable.  Lastly, measure the play space you intend to use so you know that you have the room.Enjoy VR!

Honestly after setting this up and trying it out, im so glad i bought it! The system arrived in great condition and the VR is both breathtaking and responsive! Only thing that bothers me is the small amount of chromatic aberration the screen gives off and the need to adjust and refocus the eye lenses. But it is fairly new technology and as such isn't going to be perfect. Still i have no regrets, its great.

Absolutely incredible.Although, beware if you are extreme nearsighted or farsighted.I read that nearsighted people would have no problem viewing with glasses. Some even said nearsighted people won't even need glasses in the headset.This was not the case for me. I am nearsighted. Put something 6 inches from my face and I can see it clearly. Closer or further, things get fuzzy.My glasses fit fine in the headset but everything was fuzzy.I went to my optometrist for help and he gave me prescription reading glasses to use in the headset. $360 dollars later I can see much better.Things are still slightly fuzzy because the special prescription can't be made any better because of my extreme nearsightedness.Check it out THOROUGHLY before buying if you wear glasses.This truly is an amazing piece of hardware. I live in a tiny studio apartment but when I strap on that helmet I'm in a vast space.I've watched movies using the desktop feature and they look good on an immense 10 foot screen.Steam, which powers the Vive, has new VR titles every day, some of which are mindblowing.Even playing non VR games in theater mode is awesome. Although I must say that some games, like Fallout 4, have a pronounced3D look to them while not being true VR.Get yourself a good pair of surround headphones to accompany this. The earbuds supplied are less than adequate.

Nonstop audio issues that you can’t fix in windows or steamvr. Every time I’d switch a game the headset input would either change or go completely mute and wouldn’t fix unless you reset it a few times. Audio mirroring never worked. Blurry picture and the controllers are awkward. The only advantage it has over the index is wireless but you have to spend another $300 for that and you’re already paying more for a worse product.

What can you say about best VR helmet on the market? It gives all you want.Just be aware that some games(like onward) can call dizziness and you'll need time to adapt. I myself needed about 3-4 hours for this feeling to disappear.8 Gigs of 2133 RAM, i5 46xx, 970 GTX - enough almost for everything.P.S. If you have Laptop with two graphic cards(Intel integrated to processor and main card), there is a possibility that you'll have to play with USB/HDMI cable and drivers install-uninstall so that Vive started to work. But it's a one-time setup issue and only on laptops with two graphic cards

I had never experienced VR before purchasing this product, and I have to say this headset is a LOT of fun. VR isn't at the point where you feel totally in the game yet, but the Vive's control scheme alone is unlike anything else I have used. Tracking is crazy accurate and I didn't get motionsick and easily as I thought I would. Good investment, especially for those curious about VR.

First the technology is amazing, however this being an amazon product review I must rate the posted product. I purchased the unit on April 7th and it clearly stated that fallout 4 VR was included, however it was not. The promotion ended on 3/31 so someone didn’t update the product listing. Instead I received a code for a subscription to VivePort, but to redeem the the 2 “free” months you are required to register a credit card or PayPal account for future billing. I will not trust a company with my credit card number that pulls a bait and switch. Without content I’ve been relegated to mediocre experiences. I’ll now need to spend another $60 for fallout 4. Disappointing.Update: HTC customer service was patient but wouldn’t honor Fallout4 promotion. The promotion that was substituted was for 2 months of “Free” Viveport subscription service. However this is a deceptive business practice because it is NOT free. It requires you to register a credit card before you may redeem it. There is no information or reference to any stipulations provided with the product promotion or even the physical activation card. HTC Customer service didn’t see the issue as you could just “cancel” the service before the first billing.But having already had issues; I wouldn’t trust that there wouldn’t be more. Viveport obviously does this in the hopes people will forget or fail to cancel their subscription before the expiration of the promotion. It is dishonest, and if you don’t have  a credit card (or PayPal account) you wouldn’t have the ability to claim this “Free” promotion anyway.

Awesome product.  When setting up HTC Vive, make sure HTC Vive and monitor are both connected to same video card.  I tried to connect monitor to integrated video card and then connect HTC Vive to separate video card and the HTC Vive would not work correctly.  Once I connected monitor to the video card that HTC Vive was connected to, everything worked fine.  Note:  HTC Vive connects to HDMI / Monitor connects to other port, like DP.  You may need to buy a separate cable or adapter to be able to connect monitor (i.e. DP to HDMI).

I am so happy with this compared to the PS VR. With the PS VR it is such a pain to start playing games because of the bad tracking. Because of that it was such a bother to play that I never did. With the full-room tracking, you can take it off, turn it off, move it out of range, unplug it, do whatever and it will find you as soon as you turn it back on.

This is an amazing product, but it has many flaws. One is that the tracking isn't the best for full room scale because there are only 2 trackers. The headset is in pristine quality, and runs smooth on all VR games. I would not recommend this product because it is not worth the $500 price tag. I suggest waiting until prices drop. Other than that, this headset is pretty good.

Pretty cool but still an overpriced novelty item at this point in this tech's development. When it's good, it's really good. Vanishing Realms is by far my fav and the immersion is incredible. So much so that I feel tightening in my body when being hit with arrows and swords. Some things aren't as good however, e.g. weight of headset (kills my old neck after a half an hour), ocular clarity and lack of focus adjustment, headset ventilation, and limited library of titles. If I had to do it all over again, I would wait for a version or two later when higher resolution and perhaps a cordless solution are available. Being tethered to the unit takes a lot away from the experience. One a side note, one of the trackers malfunctioned and I had to ship it to HTC at my own expense. We were without a working system for two weeks and out another $20 as a result. HTC customer service was solid though.

If you're getting it for the resolution, it's better for reading text at normal size, which is great for virtual desktop, but the improvement is only subconsciously noticeable in games.  The headset is more weight balanced and better quality.  A downside is when you move your eyes, the peripheral seems more blurry than the original.  Overall, not worth the money given the competition out now and soon.  Get it if you really need it and have a boatload of cash.

This is amazing & out of all the VR systems out I do think the HTC Vive has the most potential. However before buying make sure the games that you plan to play the most don't rely on pushing the touchpad to use as buttons. If you search for ""Unresponsive Vive controls"" you can see that there is a design flaw with the buttons (not the touchpad itself, but pressing them to use as buttons) either don't work out of the box or break very quickly from use. It's most common in the 3 & 6 o'clock positions, I'm on my 4th controller already. The best I've managed is one where it just struggles moving down (I mostly play New Retro Arcade Neon & obviously it's frustrating to play a game like Pac-Man when your RIGHT & DOWN joystick buttons don't always work).There are instructions online for how to DIY fix this issue but be advised you are definitely voiding your warranty doing so, and as always risk damaging something else if you mess up. Also for me personally when you pay $800+ for a gaming system (and $130 per replacement controller) the controls shouldn't need fixing within a week of buying it. This flaw isn't likely getting corrected in manufacturing as HTC is already developing their 2nd Generation controller so in general I'd suggest just waiting to buy a Vive when they roll out the new controller model.

The coolest toy I've bought in a very long time. The feeling of flying my very own spaceship in Elite Dangerous is nothing short of breathtaking. Dodging arrows and cutting down orcs with my sword in Trickster VR is exhilarating. Filling up and playing with virtual balloons in The Lab is mind blowing. The HTC Vive has made me feel like a kid again. Discovering new worlds and tantalizing the senses. Gaming is a completely different experience as you are fully immersed in them like never before. With 1:1 scaling, which is not possible on a standard screen, large objects like space stations feel absolutely massive. Being able to kneel down and look around in ways never before possible just simply never gets old.Beyond games there are many social experiences to be had in VR, one such app is Sportsbar VR, The most realistsic virtual representation of pool I have ever seen. You can also play darts, skeeball and air hockey among others things. You can meet up with friends or make new friends in a fully realized virtual ""bar"". I also use an app called Bigscreen (which is free) and it is the coolest thing for watching movies or TV. You can watch anything from your computer on a massive 100' screen if you want. In this app you can also watch movies and TV with friends or strangers and you can even stream 3D movies! Absolutely incredible!I could literally go on and on about this thing. I love having people come over and experience it for the first time. This is the coolest piece of tech around and I am more than happy with my purchase. There is a ton of free games and apps you can get right away if you don't feel like spending any more cash. However there are also a ton of very well made games and apps that are certainly worth checking out. The only downside I should mention is that you need a rather powerful PC in order to get the best experience from the headset. Also, if you have to get just one VR headset then forget the Oculus Rift as the Vive can play Oculus titles seamlessly now.If you have the cash just get it, you'll continue to thank yourself that you did!

The second time i broke was when I hit the controllers together, no avoiding it while playing VR. The haptic feedback/ vibration stopped working.

But once you get immersed you won't notice is.- The game I've played the most is audio shield, because I use it as a fitness app. 1.5 hours 5 days weeks.- For movement I might need to get the Virtuix Omni.

Best VR set on the market. Great deal and support from amazon when necessary. A shame that it's still so expensive to most consumers. But it is realistically worth the money. The real struggle is getting enough games to go with it, not the hardware itself!

When I first got the Vive it had a dead pixel right out of the box. I contacted Amazon and they immediately sent a replacement and gave me a month to return the original. Its important to mention that I was still able to play with the one dead pixel and not notice it 95% of the time and everything else worked flawlessly. I got the new one and its super fun, would have been 5 Stars if it wasn't for the one dead pixel on the original Vive I got.

Package arrived and the box containing the vive pro had clearly been opened. At this price point I should not be receiving returned hardware. Cables and hardware were haphazardly placed in the box, not in the retail positions they should be. Haven’t even bothered assembling the headset, very disappointed.

Having dipped my toes into a few different Virtual Reality systems over the last few years, I have to say I'm finally happy with a system for my PC that doesn't make me feel like I made any huge compromises. Google Cardboard is a great way to play with cheap hardware, Samsung's GearVR is a surprisingly excellent performer due to the advanced head tracking and even higher resolution than the HTC Vive or the Oculus Rift CV1. The open source OSVR headset has potential, though requires a lot more hand-holding to get it running.But the Vive? It's ready for prime time, with only a few small issues.The image quality has the potential to be really great, with a few issues arising from the choice of Fresnel lenses (lenses made with concentric rings inside them to shape the image) and the resultant reflection and glow that you might get from bright parts of the display when most of the display is dark in shade. The pixel density also isn't quite where it really needs to be going forward, but with the difficulty of even today's high end video cards being able to keep up at full speed in some game titles, it's an understandable limitation.The three-in-one cable running from the breakout box that you plug the headset into as an intermediary to add power to connections that otherwise come from the host PC, has apparently begun to be replaced for some warranty returns, with a single cable that splits into three discrete plugs on each end. This is *exactly* what the Vive needs, to help reduce the weight and complexity of the cabling. It's a small annoyance, if anything.Headset tracking seems to be quite good, when you have the base stations/lighthouses set up properly in your playing area. It can take a little fine tuning, but the tools are in the settings screen and you can figure them out relatively easily.The controllers are absolutely terrifyingly accurate. It doesn't take long until you're thinking of them as an extension of your hand, and not just a controller you're holding. You will feel like your hands are where the image says they are, because they are. The only drawback I feel there is with the controllers, is that the side ""grip"" buttons could be placed higher on the handle, or possibly curl around beneath the grip for a little more contact surface with more flexible parts of the hand.There is easily room for adding two or three more buttons to the controller without getting too complex. Fortunately, the controller's ability to put multiple buttons and controls on the haptic touchpads (mechanically identical to those on the Steam Controller) in order to add more features for various game titles.All in all, if you want a VR rig in 2016, the one to get is the Vive. You'll know that every Vive comes with controllers, so game developers will know that at least this part of the market has them to work with for sure. If you don't find yourself entranced simply playing Tilt Brush for hours at a time, I'd be shocked.

I would recommend purchasing a different VR system.  One of the base stations broke after only a few times playing.  The warranty is only a year so it costs $90 to repair the base station if you send it in and $130 for a new base station.  I'm purchasing a new base station but who knows how long that will last.

Love VR to death but the vive's lenses need to be changed. They distort imagery if you're not perfectly focused dead center. Other vr systems I've seen do not use the same lenses, they have more of a magnifying glass look to them. Hopefully future adaptations change this out. Other than that, pretty cool product.

This was one of the best tech buys of my life.  I just played a tennis match in Melbourne, Australia with First Person Tennis.  It was beautiful, sunny, and warm there in VR world, even though here in NJ it was cold and snowy as I was playing.  It was quite a workout.  Much better than walking on a treadmill.  Sometimes VR world is better than the real world.  My wife just traveled the world with Google Earth VR and my seven year old son just painted with Google's Tilt Brush, drove around on Mars with the Martian VR Experience, and flew like an Eagle in Eagle Flight.  Sure there are still a few kinks to work out with everything, but the entire experience is just mindblowingly incredible and we all can't wait to play with it again every day!  Truly this is an incredible toy...

TL:DR- 1) If you own a VR capable PC  2) Are comfortable troubleshooting basic PC/peripheral device issues  3) Are willing to do a bit of research leading into the future of this product developmentThen you should not question if it is worth the price of admission for the Vive. Every time you put on this headset or showcase this to a person who has never experienced VR, it will bring a smile to your face. It's a whole new medium that brings an experience to the table that can be enjoyed by a wide spectrum of age groups and cultures. This is going to change the world.Long Version-I have bought over 300 items off Amazon without ever writing a review, but I feel like screaming at the top of my lungs with praise for this VR system. This is a game changing peripheral device that has the opportunity to change the world and be utilized in various professional industries. If you are reading this and have never used a Vive, it's difficult to describe using words to someone. How do you describe an experience to someone who has never experienced the same art ""medium"" as you have? Could you imagine trying to describe what it's like to watch TV or a motion picture to someone who has never seen a digital display? The best I have come up with is it's a ""total immersion"" experience. To sum it up in an example, my parents and grandparents have never had a passing interest in ""video games"", yet I had to set time limits and a rotation pattern for them because they did not want to take it off!I have never been so satisfied with a compute related purchase in my life. I bought it with the mentality that if I didn't think it was a game changing device, I would return it and wait for it to become mainstream and cheaper. But the moment I put on the headset, jumped into Google Earth VR, traveled to all the countries I visited on a previous deployment while staring at the milky way above my head, I knew I was hooked. It's an awe-inspiring experience each time I turn it on, and this is only the beginning.I use this as a supplement to my iRacing Simulator and DCS Flight Simulator. For the immersion, depth of field, depth perception, and realism, it is worth the price of admission alone. If you are reading this and use either flight simulators or racing simulators, you already know the benefits this device can provide to your training and hobby. It's single handily the best upgrade I have ever done to my simulators and this is by far not the most expensive upgrade I have added to those rigs. If you sim race or use other simulators, this should be on your 2017 upgrade path.Other VR games- The steam store is going to be the future one stop shop for all VR related games. Steam has begun accepting all VR headsets to be used within Steam, and I believe this business strategy will outlast Oculus’s “exclusive” game orientation. We all observed how well that worked for Microsoft, how well do you think it will work for Oculus?Over 80% of the games I use in VR are FREE on the Steam store for early access or testing. Want to go explore the human body? Go download The Body VR and explore the cells within your blood stream. Want to showcase how immerse and large the digital experience can be on the Vive? Go launch The Lab and waste 5 hours of your day. Want to make art with Nebulas in a space sandbox? Fire up Cosmic Sugar VR. Every day, new free or cheap games are being added to Steam. It’s a developer dream right now and almost every major design studio is starting to experiment with these devices.OCULUS VS VIVE- I have extensively used both for both sim racing, flight simulation, and general gaming. We will have to wait and see how the Oculus Touch will pan out, but early reports are showing its room-scale immersion is still lacking compared to the Vive and at a higher price point. In my opinion, the bashing from both sides needs to stop as both are progressing VR forward, but the Vive is on another medium than the Oculus. Using a Xbox controller with VR feels analog, lacking immersion, and dare I say it: last generation. HTC had more forward thinking on the direction of VR in creating this product and they have Oculus backtracking and rushing to develop a solution. Look to HTC to release a second style of controllers in 2017 to start motion tracking fingers without the need to hold a controller and a wireless solution for the “tail” of thick wires connected to the device.We will look back on these moments years from now in the future and people will recount their first experiences when VR launched and I can confidently say I will have been glad I was an early adopter and pushed this technology forward. All aboard the VR train; it's leaving the station with or without you.

Absolutely loving the hardware.The only thing I don't like thus far is my own situation - in that my play space is an office with a slightly larger than minimum play space.I highly recommend you try to find the largest place you can for this. Even moving aside a couch in a living room to play is preferable to a smaller space, as the freedom to move is such an experience.Also, on that note, you will need your powerful PC to be adjacent to the space. Some people have found success extending their cord length with USB cables, HDMI cables, and power strips, but if you do not want to, you'll need the computer to be directly adjacent.One tip - for mounting the lighthouses, if you're doing it above molding, make sure you do it high enough that you can freely move them around to get the right angles. I now have several holes in my walls I need to fill after not properly considering. (Excitement can make you cut corners)

Virtual Reality (the Vive especially) is an incredible experience. Something that's hard to describe to people. Every time I tell someone about it I say ""It really feels like you're actually there."" They say ""Yeah, of course, I mean it's virtual reality."" Then they try it and every single time they stand there a little taken aback for a minute. Then they say, ""It really feels like you're actually there.""I use mine nearly every day even after months of owning it. It's also fantastic exercise. Lost a bunch of weight using it.The device itself is very durable and well made.My only problem with the Vive specifically is the headstrap. It's alright, but around the ears it's too low and can get a little uncomfortable.

I remember trying a helmet 10 years ago and the instant headache, lack of depth perception and clarity, etc...No joke, I can't put into words how awesome the experience is. I thought it was hype and the technology to be latency free wasn't going to be there yet. That was, until my friend bought one and let me try it. I have since dedicated a room and re-purposed my PC and the kids and wife now use the Vive for game night. I can't even go back to playing non VR games and sit in a chair for hours. I have even replaced some workout routines with games like Holopoint and Space Pirate Trainer. (Not joking, you play those games right and you won't be able to play it again the next day until your legs are rested)If you have the PC to push it, and the cash for the system, BUY IT. There is no comparison to other ""seated/stand only"" units. The room experience is the only way to go. Jump, run, dodge, you name it. HTC/Valve went the proper path with the room experience. Its the only way to go.The kids and wife like exploring with Google Earth VR, my friends and I shoot zombies and dodge arrows, and the kids love things like Job Simulator (So do I) and others.With kids, work, fitness and others I don't have the free game time that I used to, so I was starting to shy away from sitting in a chair for 6 hours and playing CIV6 for example. Now my game time has been turned back into a super-premium experience where a few hours here and there is amazing and I don't feel like I gained 5 pounds playing it.Anyhow, like the others stated, until you use one or try it, I can't put the experience into writing.I will leave you with an example.We played a game called Plank where you are on top of a skyscraper walking on a plank.It is such an experience that the first few friends didn't even walk out of the building. I did it an almost fell over when I fell off and took the headset off before I hit the ground.My other friend was out on the plank and, me being who I am, pushed her. Well, she fell to the ground face first and just laid there until she hit the ""virtual ground"".I did not expect it to really have the impact that it did, I'm not THAT much of a jerk, but it does give you an example of how real it feels to the player.So don't push people you like off the plank game. They will probably fall over and break something. Push only people you don't like off the plank game.And with that, you clearly need to purchase this. Right. Now.

Virtual Reality is still in its infancy. The Vive is a strong example of what it will eventually be like, but still an example. The resolution is painfully low - it's especially evident on virtual screens, which you can't read unless they're right up against your face. There are some minor hardware bugs, and the multiplayer games are still lacking population because of the price barrier. The best single player games for it right now are community mods of games like Minecraft and Metroid Prime. The tech just hasn't existed for long enough for AAA games to have been completed yet. VR is an experience you ought to eventually have, but also one worth waiting for another hardware generation or two for if you aren't dying to burn $800 on something nifty right away.

To put this review into perspective I have tried a few different VR experiences in the past. I owned the Oculus DK1 and while it was fun to mess around with, it definitely had it's flaws. I have also tried mobile VR sets such as the Samsung Gear VR.Packaging: This product comes very well packaged in a large box with lots of padding, I was very impressed with the unboxing experience .The box includes all of the cable and wall bricks for charging that you would need to get the device up and running.Setup: The initial hardware setup may initially look daunting, there are a few cable and that need to be plugged in and run around your space as well as mounting the tracking system, but when moved through step by step it is very straight forward. The tracking system needs to be screwed into a wall or sturdily attached to a rigid structure and power cables need to be run to there location. The headset then needs to be connected to a small included box which is then connected to your pc. Their are many videos online detailing this whole process. One suggestion of mine would be to plug your controllers in so they charge right away and will be fully charged when the hardware setup is complete. The software setup was a breeze as the installer walks you through the whole process,Experience: The VR experience that this provides is mind blowing and totally worth the money. It's not even comparable to other mobile VR systems or the older systems. It simply is in another league. Objects seem to be right in front of you and with the tracked controllers you can actually reach out and interact with them. It is crazy. When you factor in room scale, it is a whole new experience as well. You are able to walk around in a whole new environment totally immersed. Every time I put the headset on I am shocked at how convincing the whole experience is.If you have the cash, the space, and a computer that can handle this device it should be your next purchase. I don't regret my purchase at all.

TLDR: Lots of fun but becomes a novelty quickly.I originally tried the HTC Vive out at a VR store and loved it. I played for about an hour and really wanted to get one. My computer was up to snuff (GTX 970 and i7 4790k). I plugged it in and was presently surprised by the performance. Although the GTX 970 is the minimum GPU it worked well enough for most games.However, the issues soon started to pop up. First let me say I understand this is a Gen 1 product. Here is what bothered me most about the Vive.The lack of (original) games! Most of the recommended and ""good"" games are just wave based shooters with different skins...looking at you Raw Data. Don't get me wrong! They're a lot of fun but eventually become tedious.The game marketplace has no strong developers present. The lack of AAA titles is a bummer. Not to mention its a pain in the butt to weed through the Steam marketplace. It's flooded with half baked, cheap games.No matter what you do the headset display will never be 100% clear. Many people go, just adjust the headset! No amount of PDP correction, lens distance, super sampling (more on that below) or strap configuration can change that. There's an inherit ""sweet spot"" on the lens and if you look out of that it's blurry. This is especially problematic when so many game developers put HUD information in your peripheral.The headset gets steamy! The stock face gasket is literally a Sponge material. It sucks up sweat. VR is very active. This can make swapping headsets with your buddy disgusting. I tried the aftermarket 6mm non permeable gasket and that was no better. It was uncomfortable on the face and trapped heat causing fogging of the lenses. Although, the FOV was slightly increased with the 6mm gasket.The cables are a pain in the butt. Pretty much no matter what you do (aside from mounting a pully to the ceiling) you'll trip over your cable and get it tangled. This is fine for the first few days until everytime you want to play VR you have to battle it's Medusa like cords.I will say the lighthouses and controllers seem to be of very good quality. The tracking is spot on.I ended up purchasing a GTX 1080 to allow for super sampling in a hope to get a crisper image. While it did help, it wasn't where I needed it to be. I liked the idea of a virtual desktop (app on steam) but image quality paled in comparison to my old 1080p monitor. It just wasn't practical.Long stort short. It's a really cool device. Is it worth a $1k computer and $800 dollar device? Not really. The novelty wears off quickly and you'll find yourself not bothering to use it. Take my advice and pick up the next generation once a few of these problems iron out.

Revising my review- the Vive itself is great, However; the limited options for HTC's technical support RMA and other show stoppers if you are a content creator are notorious. This is where Amazon stepped in with a much faster return process.With a properly configured system, the Vive will transport you to other worlds--or allow you to create your own. Very little can be said to really describe VR, you just have to try one somewhere. A PSVR is a good starting point, it gives you a sense of what this technology can do- the Vive is much more refined and purpose built, and expands on that with pinpoint accuracy and higher end hardware.

There was nothing that could prepare me for how amazing this experience was. It is not without it's faults considering I wear glasses and they tend to fog up depending on the weather, but I was still reeling from the immersion of this type of VR. Do not skip the deluxe audio strap I think it is pretty much mandatory for a great experience for both comfort and a simpler means of connecting audio to the system.

Received this as an Christmas present, it was all I wanted!  It is great, once you get it setup and properly aligned on your face.  As this is a 1st generation device, don't expect it too be perfect.  There is a screen door affect, which I notice during dark scenes, but I never notice it during regular game play.  If you have a small room, make sure you pay attention to where you are as much as possible!  Also, if you have low ceilings, get some covers for the wands, as I banged them against the ceiling a couple of times during game play.  (you just get so immersed in games and forget there are walls and ceilings!)As a suggestion, do not install the bluetooth drivers that come with the device, instead use what Windows 10 provides.  (don't know if Windows 7/8 work though.)  I wanted to be able to control the lighthouses via bluetooth, so they would turn on/off automatically, but it never worked.  Noticed in the device manager that the bluetooth drivers installed by Vive/Steam were not working properly, so I rolled-back/uninstalled them, and the default drivers that Windows 10 had worked fine.  Now everything with the lighthouses works great!

It's a wonderful system, but it's not really ready unless your an enthusiast or a developer. Personally, I'm both; I love new tech and I'm working on making games for VR.The tracking is remarkable and the sense of presence you get it like nothing else I've experienced. It's a very fiddly system and a bit technical to set up, so it's hard for me to recommend to the average consumer, especially with the current price ($800, not counting the beast of a computer you need to run it).That being said, this is easily the coolest thing I've ever owned. It's really hard to describe to people who haven't tried it. I've tried, but it's not until they put the headset on that they really get it.If you're an enthusiast or aspiring developer, see if you can find one to try before you decide.If you're an average consumer who just wants to play games, maybe wait until Gen 2 comes along. (But if you've got a developer friend go to their house and try it because it's *awesome*)

Warning! Check your settings in steamVR!! anything below a 1080ti is getting down sampled on the pro! So it will not look as sharp as it should! If you have a good cpu and a 1080ti crank that global supersample setting up to 170% and up (depending on the game) (the Pro also has a firmware glitch causing low bass via the headphones and this is confirmed via htc. A patch should be coming out soonish. So don't evaluate the headphones too much yet). I have a 1080ti and immediately noticed how much farther i can see, it's got a nice crispness that VR sorely needed. at this point we are literally pushing the graphical power of modern consumer tech, this is the best you will get for now.All in all as a previous OG Vive owner, i am enjoying it thoroughly. And the time i will spend in it justifies the price for me personally.Welp i had saved up a bit in anticipation of the pro's launch. (Thanks amazon for the 100$ gift card i had lying around from a previous deal). It is everything i wanted it to be. i can really push the clarity with that supersampling.. like wow i can actually see 10 feet away clearly in steam vr home. No more teleporting up to the tv. Onward is amazing now, those far maps? You'll spot that head poking out now. Do VR graffiti? The paint looks so much crisper, really helps get your thin lining up better. Like sim games? Racing and flying sim users will love this added clarity. The price was... pretty high. But it's my hobby and i have no regrets. Really glad i jumped the gun.I love it so far. I love tech and i love playing with the high end gadgets. If you just want to dabble in vr look at the OG Vive, it's still an amazing headset. If you got some money to blow, then get the pro. It really comes down to personal value and i believe everyone's opinion matters on the subject. For some it is worth it and for others it won't be. Really depends on how much vr gaming you do.The headset is very comfortable, i can not emphasize the need to get it placed right. But once you do it is amazing.

The product works excellently save for one key issue: my connector box (which interfaces between the cables of the Vive headset and the computer) appears to have a bad HDMI port. I remedied this by bypassing it directly from my headset to my computer's port. Previous to this fix, the headset would produce a red light and fail to recognize by SteamVR.For this reason, I cannot give it five stars.

Beautiful and amazing technology that everyone should try Not just on the gaming side, but in general. The only complaint I have is that the head strap doesn't come down the back of the head enough for most people I've seen wear it to wear 100% comfortably. This makes it difficult to look straight down in VR without the headset trying to fall off.

This is my first VR system that I've ever owned and honestly it's so fun. The setup is long, especially if you don't have fast internet, and make sure your computer is HTC compatible with a VR test on Steam. The setup is really easy once you can get it to load, and the games are really relatively cheap. If you're saving up for this system, get the HTC Vive Pro

Great experience during the time the headset worked. Set up was simple, i recommend tat you watch a couple of videos on Youtube before attempting set up, it helps to know what you are dealing with.I started playing Il-2 Battle of Stalingrad, a great WW2 flying combat simulator. The experience was impressive and i cannot see myself playing it any other way from now on, that is if you can get over the "" screen door"" effect. Being a technology that is in its infancy ingues it is expected that the images would not be as beautiful as it is on you 4k monitor but if the game is interesting you will forget easily that it looks like you are looking through your screens in one of your house windows.Well, everything was great for a couple of days until i started having serious problems with tracking and the headset became unresponsive, i try everything i could find online and nothing worked, by chance i noticed that the USB cable was very loose where it attaches to the headset port, as i wiggled the cable the headset would come to life but as soon as i tried to move it so i could wear it the thing went dead again, i did not want to mess trying to put pieces of paper and other things to secure the cable to the port as other have done ( this seems to be a common problem as i found out later searching for this problem online).So i decided to return this unit in exchange for a new one, hopefully this new one works as it should. When it works it is amazing. I cannot compare it tonthe Rift as i have not tried that one.

Now with purchasing the Vive I was very excited yet slightly concerned about what problems many people have faced, while the product may be on the steep side; if you are very confident that what you have can handle the hardware and have the right idea on your pay space and are even remotely tech savvy and ready to tinker around without feeling annoyed then I'll say you will have a great experience. BUT!! And this is a huge but; if you are somewhat not familiar with the workings of Windows or any form of OS then this might give you some hairs to pull. I can say I had no real problems setting up the Vive without minor issues with the controllers having to be connected via USB every time I want to pair the controllers or unplugging the Powered USB from the converter box connected to my PC when I want to reset without running into error 99 problems, all in all this thing is not consumer friendly to the state of Mothers and fathers getting this for their 10 year old or so on. BUT! This is one of the best experiences video games can give you to date and if you have the means and the knowledge and really want that VR roomscale experience then go and buy what are you waiting for!

This is going to be a short ""review"" just highlighting a few oh my personal experiences/issues (both positive and negative)PROS: Definitely feels like the future. There's a high enough quality to all aspects of the product that I feel it's definitely worth something close to the amount they're selling it for. For the sheer experience of virtual reality, on-call, it's definitely an amazing sensation. For the games that are currently offered for VR, it's pretty okay. I definitely recommend the VIVE if you have the money to spare, and want to be a part of the first generation of gamers who want to step into the realm of VR and basically beta-test the whole thing.CONS: Two Big Things:- Price: While gaming consoles are running around $200 - $500, the VIVE sells for $700 MSRP. I got a discount because gift cards and an error with shipping, and frankly I still feel like I paid a bit too much for this. Yes, the feeling of being the first generation of true VR is cool and all, but dang, I could have upgraded my desktop big time with the money I spent on this, just for the pleasure of playing a few. Speaking of, the power your computer has to have to run VR in a satisfactory manner means you've already invested a lot of money, so take that into consideration.- Games: ...games. Big issue number two, is the games. There are a lot of independent developers making games for VIVE right now, and very few big-time, AAA titles for VR. As a result, every game almost feels like a beta, even the ones that are ""complete"". A lot are Early Access on Steam, and aren't going to offer any in-depth experiences. The most common feeling you'll probably have is that you're playing a beta designed to show off a proof of concept, rather than a full game with story and character and emotional investment. Each game will have its gimmick (physics, horror/atmosphere, immersion), but beyond that one focus there will be very little else. After owning the VIVE since the beginning of 2017, I've bought several games, and most I have less than two hours playing, each. This review is being posted a day before April, so in total, I've logged a very, very small amount of time in VR, simply because once you've spent two hours in any game, you pretty much know what you're going to get from then on, with little variation (obviously not all games are the same, some last longer than others, I'm just talking about 'on average').So, there's my opinion on it. Take it for what it's worth (not as much as the VIVE, badum-tish!), but that's been my experience and opinion thus far, and really all I can offer at this point. To fully describe the VR experience would take an hour--it's amazing. It really is darn amazing. Room scale and everything they advertise, it's true. It works. When you're in the Virtual World, you are IN the Virtual World. But with lackluster games at the moment, and the high price, it's only for the most extreme of PC Gaming hobbyists. Think long and hard before you buy one, is all I'll say. Other than that, happy gaming, and have fun!

Read the review titled ""Regardless of cost, you will absolutely love this. Let me explain why"" By Chris on September 28, 2016.  Everything he said is true - pro and con.I will add, that until you try it you can't really understand what the hype is about.  Everyone knows what VR is, you put on a silly helmet and you can look around a computer generated environment.  What people don't expect is the effect it has on their body and mind.  I love having people over and showing it off.  The initial reaction is always the same, completely blown away, jaws literally drop.

I got the headset, setup two base stations, installed required software/firmware, and finally got it to work.  The VR view with the headset on, however, were all blurry, I had to constantly move around my head to see letters/image clearly.  Yes, I did try to adust the view with  nob on each side of the headset, but it was no go.  The headset itself looks cool, and it is a lot lighter than it looks.  I have to say VR is still in its infant stage.  Maybe I will purchase it again after few years.

This is amazing. Even after two weeks of owning it and using it regularly, that's the first thing that needs to be said to describe it. Once it's all hooked up and ready to go, when you put that headset on, you are somewhere else. You're in another room. Probably an enormous, vast room with high ceilings and echo-y walls; maybe an old airplane hanger. Or cavernous dungeon. As it's been said many times, it's impossible to describe just exactly how VR feels without trying it, and it's true. Not that it doesn't have it's considerations and caveats, but they're all worth it.First and most obvious caveat is that you need a very good system (particularly the GPU) to power the Vive. I have the Intel i7-5820K hex core processor and GTX 980 GPU, and it works pretty flawlessly. But that's edging towards outdated already with the 1060 and 1080 out now. Bottom line: pretty much need at least the GTX 980 or equivalent, for now. It also works with my laptop (gtx980m) but there has been some lag noticed here and there with the lap. (see product description for official system/ports requirements - also need HDMI and USB3)Second, and pretty much tied for first when it comes to overall importance, is space. You need a relatively big open space to really take advantage of the Vive's room-scale feature-- that lets you move around, and generates that feels-like-you're-somewhere-else feeling. I have a modest-sized home with no vacant rooms, so I opted to use my dining room as my ""play area"" by sliding my dining room table to the side of the room. It's roughly 9-10ft square, with 7.5ft ceilings. This space seems adequate so far with the games and software I've used, although I do find myself bumping into those blue grids more than I'd like.And a very close Third is setup and ongoing use. The setup for this thing is no joke. If you have a room or space to commit to it semi-permanently, you probably want to mount the 2 sensors to the wall with screws or clamp to a sturdy bookcase or fixture. Or you can use light tripods (not cheap x2). The 2 sensors also need to be plugged in (all cords included but I needed at least 1 additional small extension cord). The box that connects your PC to the VR headset also needs a power supply. It might be obvious, but it's worth stating that your high-end computer with the at-least-gtx980 GPU also needs to be relatively near your ""play area"". My desktop area is adjacent to my dining room so I bought some 15' cables to make it work. What it boils down to is: if you don't have a dedicated area for the VR, there will be some set-up and tear-down each time you want to use it.And a distant Fourth... you have to find that sweet spot of comfort when wearing the headset. Sort of like using the 3DS and finding that just-right angle, you have to find that with this headset. It comes with an eye-distance measuring tool and you can adjust it on the headset, but you have to tinker with it a bit to make it both comfortable on your head and have consistent clear vision for extended sessions.Once you have it and you've figured out your setup and it's ready to go, all of the above caveats will ring true, but also not matter. Because you'll be in another world.

This might be the best thing I have ever purchased.  I know it sounds like I'm over exaggerating but it honestly changes everything.  Everything about gaming, entertainment, just everything.  To experience VR is just so awesome its indescribable.  This might date me, but remember back in the day when you were a kid and your  parents bought you a new Atari for christmas?  You got that thing hooked up to your fat small screen tv, got the space invaders plugged in and those rubber red button joysticks out and it was the the most glorious thing ever.  looking back the graphics were super crappy but back in the day they were just the most awesome high-tech thing you've ever experienced in your short life as a kid.  That feeling you had then, that feeling that you are experiencing something new and huge and world changing... well, thats how I feel right now.  The Vive (or any true VR) transports you someplace else.  I mean alot of the graphics seem cartoony but when you put on the googles... wow... it becomes so real.  I mean you know its a game but your body and your brain react like its real.  I know it doesn't make sense but I swear when your up on a building and you look down.  It scares you like it was real.  Anyway, you really don't have to believe me.  You don't technically need to buy one, just try it somewhere... with a friend or someone who has one.  Watching a video on YouTube really can not convey how awesome it is.  It is more than just games, its like being transported somewhere else.  Anyway, big ups to Amazon who got me me the Vive a day earlier than expected, I literally waited only a couple days.  Setting up is easy, just make sure to buy the stands because being able to move the 'lighthouses' lets you expand or shrink your playing area easily and when you know no ones coming over go ahead and move the furniture around because walking around in these games is soooo awesome (sorry oculus owners).  I know its expensive but its worth every penny.

The HTC VIVE greatly exceeded my expectations!  It was a bit difficult to get used to at first and takes some time to get acclimated to the kind of visuals you'll experience, but once you're inside of a game in this thing you'll be wondering how they hell HTC/Steam pulled this off.  I caught myself having that feeling that you got when you first when to Disneyland as a kid: things seem impossible and fantastic at the same time.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who has a good enough computer to run it. I'm so impressed with it that I plan to have parties centered around gaming with the VIVE.  Great job HTC!Everything about this is impressive, right down to the packaging it came in.  They clearly care about presentation!  The device itself is futuristic yet rugged.  The controllers are an advanced design and all of the buttons are easy to manipulate.  The tracking system has yet to fail on me.  Every little thing is tracked with extreme accuracy, which I think is very difficult to pull off!  I put the tracking boxes on photography light stands, which seems to work quite well.I can't say enough about how impressed I am with this device and the couple of games I've played so far.  It's no wonder some of the more reputable game development companies have recently put big money into development of some VR games.

Very solid build, easy to work with, initial setup can be time consuming. Once you are in, that virtual world is so much fun. I've spent hours playing games before I even realized it. If during setup it dose not see one of your controllers just place it near the headset and it should be able to find it. If your are reading this you should buy one!

After 2 days of struggling to install the vive believing I had a defective unit(software wise), updated the drivers and firmware, adjusted settings in the control panel, searched hours upon hours of error codes which had very little if not any resolution to most of the issues, and even SteamVR being a huge pain in the 4th point of contact, I finally got the damn thing to work. I see the significant problem is Configuration, its by far no where near a ""plug and play"" let alone a ""plug, install and play"" kind of device. The family liked it, I'm sure they would have had a better experience without the disappointing wait, trials and errors, and overall lack of games if you haven't broken the bank yet.If you're wondering if you meet the requirements my rig uses a Pentium G4560 which is below the recommended on the vive or steam page although the GPU I run is a GTX 1060 3gb with 8 gb ddr4 ram, z270 mobo with a ssd and hdd. Quite entry level but I do get solid stable framerate despite the first time settings issues.

The HTC Vive has opened up a ""world"" of art, entertainment, and gaming unlike any other platform.  The only other system that comes close is the Oculus Rift.  Note:  PSVR is a more readily available ""cost effective"" way to experience VR, but only for the PS4 community.Until you experience what the world looks like in a headset, you really have no idea what you are missing.  I see many comments about the ""screen door effect"".  Yes, there is a screen door effect...when you strap two super-magnifying lenses on two OLED screens and place them a centimeter from your eyeballs, there is going to be some issues to work through.  As the first true commercial VR systems, the developers have created something special.  No, you don't get full-coverage crisp 1080p gameplay in the headset, and the further items are in the distance the less detail you get...remember, you have the tv screen less than an inch from your face.  Up close, the graphics are crisp and detail is clear (peripheral vision still gets muddy...if you look at the lenses you will see ""rings"" that help with the distribution of the pixels when your face is strapped in...this is where that screen door comes from).  Let me say, the screen door is not distracting when you are engaged in an experience.  Bright games tend to look a bit better as contrast suffers a little in very dark scenes.""I can't decide on VIVE on RIFT"":  Well, RIFT with TOUCH costs about the same as VIVE now...VIVE gives you more in ROOM SCALING right now.  RIFT TOUCH gives you a smaller room-scale play space.  VIVE can play several RIFT Games and RIFT plays several SteamVR (the VIVE system) games.  Both have very similar PC requirements...have a good PC or you will not enjoy your VR experiences as much.VIVE has been fun for the whole family.  Its a great workout...plan on being on your feet for a while, it will keep you interested and coming back for more.

Having owned a Samsung GearVR I was kinda ready for this - I thought.  However, I was wrong, they are completely different.  While the GearVR was good for watching videos, it did not really give you the sense of presence that full room scale does.  The tracking is quick and surprisingly accurate, the headset is relatively light and comfortable, and the system is very easy to set up.  Having used 3D viewing since shutter glasses on VGA CRT monitors, this completely blows the other experiences away.  Some people complain about the resolution, but compared to what was available a couple of years ago, it is quite impressive.  Now, it is not perfect, individual pixels are visible, lens flare occurs in high contrast situations, and focus can be a problem, but for a first generation consumer HMD, it is amazing.So, the big question, should you buy one?  Well, that depends on if you are willing to be an early adopter.  The technology is still in heavy development and what is coming out in the next 6 to 12 months will likely by much better.  However, that is still 6 to 12 months in the future, so if you want it now, it is an amazing experience.

Had it for less than two months. One of my base station is now blinking red. From what I’ve read, I’m going to have to wait months to get it replaced because of the customer service. I can use the other base station, but the tracking isn’t as good as what I paid for. Wouldn’t recommend buying at the moment.

Lots of fun so far, but make sure you keep the following in mind: You WILL need to perform a Steam VR test prior to purchasing. Make sure your hardware on your PC passes. Setup is pretty simple for the tech savvy, but you will need to do some installation on your walls. Be prepared to drill holes and have a yard stick or measuring tape handy. Some games have been a little buggy so far l, Ray Dana, for instance, won't load at all, and there's a lot of post install tweaking and things to figure out.

Playing games this thing is one of the best experiences I've had with my clothes on. VR is TOTALY AWESOME and I am old enough to remember when that term was used alot and when VR was a pipe dream, now its here and the HTC Vive is the best of the avalable headsets. If you purchase one you will not be dissapointed, just know that you will probably spend the first few days after you get it and set it up in VR and not want to do any other activity that doesn't include food or requires clothing  LOL.

I was not getting on the VR bandwagon for a long time. If you want to choose between Oculus and RIft, browse the game options on steam. Oculus games are all seated, and currently using a xbox game pad. Vive can do seated as well as room scale. At first, i didnt like the idea of dedicating floor space for VR... but i am glad I did.  Seated/Standing gaming can be very disorienting with movement - you feel like you need to lean forward and its easy to lose balance. Sit down for those games if you can. Because of this - any ""room scale"" games on steam simply will not work with oculus. If the games you want to play are room scale - go with vive.

I knew I was gonna like it, without a doubt. But for $800? Needless to say, I was slightly skeptical. Anyone who says otherwise is lying to themselves. $800 is a lot to ask for a new tech that may or may not grow into the next big thing.After 3 days if using my Vive. I get it.Don't get me wrong, I don't think this is a ""replacement to 2d gaming."". Those still have their place methinks. What we are seeing here is the development of an entirely new form of entertainment. We are in the 'Pong' phases of something big here.Honestly? It could entirely flop. And if it does that's a damn shame. After about ~20 hours of use, I can tell you that I don't regret a damn thing. VR should be here to stay. Whether the mainstream market agrees? That's up to you and the mainstream market to decide. As for me?I'm totally on board.Long live VR.

Finally, a truly unique gaming experience.  VR gaming is completely different than normal gaming. It cannot be expressed. It must be experienced. The HTC Vive is great. I haven't had any real issue with the product. Any issues I've experienced were on my part(wires not pushed completely into connectors and Lighthouses not being high enough. The higher  you can get them the better). Other than gaming you can get a program called Big Screen for free. Ever wanted to Watch Anime or NetFlix in a Theater? Big Screen can do it. People can join and share the experience with you.

VR is absolutely amazing, but neither the tech nor (much more importantly) the software are there yet. Also HTC specifically has issues across the board.Ultimately I returned it because the drivers would refuse to install from the linkbox and take about 100 reboots of the pc total to get them on, and then a week later would break and have to be reinstalled with another 100 attempts. just, screw that.

If you are even slightly interested in VR and have a computer that's able to use it. Then this is an absolute buy. Don't even hesitate as you should just buy it. VR has really taken off and I've had dozens of friends come over to try it out.  My wife and I had a dinner party at our house with a bunch of friends and family members. About 30 minutes after dinner, I showed one person my Vive and 2 minutes after them screaming ""THIS IS SO AWESOME!!"". My den to which my Vive is in. Was completely packed with people trying to use it. As someone who is a major stickler upon spending anything over $200 on any one thing. I cannot recommend the HTC Vive enough.

At first I was disappointed.  Everything was blurry except direct forward vision.  Turns out there's great variation in peoples faces.  For instance my ipd is 70mm, way outside the average of 65.  So be sure to measure and adj your ipd accordingly.Also overlooked is the depth adjustment.  On each side where the straps meet the headset are plastic tabs which pop out.  Once popped out you can rotate them to adjust the depth.  This depth Is the distance between your eyes and the screen.  Now, for me, the depth part of the equation was the most important in solving the blurriness issue.  In fact I could not get close enough to the screen even after rotating the tabs fully forward.  So, what I had to do was pull off the face mask (which is just velcro-ed in), and then put it on.  And I could not believe the difference.  Everything was finally crystal clear, up, down and all around.  Now, of course putting your face up against the narly side of Velcro is not the most comfortable thing so using some spare Velcro I had at home I made my own (much thinner) face mask with the soft Velcro side on top.So far I'm really enjoying having the vive, and look forward to playing each night after work.My system is i7 6700k, z170, 16gb, 1080gtx.

I bought my Vive after looking forward to it for a whole 2 years.  This is something I've hyped up for a long time and researched thoroughly before deciding to get.  It's currently the best VR experience on the consumer market thanks to its room scale positional tracking.  It's also the only headset I've found that is as easy to set up as the Oculus and as easy to find games for.  Sure, you can rig any OSVR kit to do similar input and run most games without room scale or with very rudimentary room scale functionality, but the Vive still does it best.  Even with Oculus Touch coming out in December (and looking awesome so far), I think you will be happier with the Vive overall, at least until the next generation of VR devices roll out.There are some cons to the Vive setup.  First, it requires wall-mounted sensor boxes in opposing corners of the room, though you could mount them on top of shelves or boxes if you're feeling creative.  Second, the positional wand controllers are a bit awkward and don't sync automatically to the headset unless you plug them into a USB3 port first.  You may have trouble activating the controllers each time you turn on SteamVR.  I couldn't get more than one controller to stay active at a time for the first few days without having the second one plugged directly the headset via a USB port I found in the top of the headset.  I was glad to have that somewhat solved after a while, but it's still something I never had to worry about with the Razer Hydra (which was awesome) or any of my wiimotes. Third, the headset will not work without the SteamVR software, but thankfully, SteamVR is a separate program to Steam and can be run without Steam if you want.  It also opens up automatically when you turn on the headset, but I've found that it's easier to just leave the headset powered on and let it go into sleep mode when not in use.  SteamVR can be opened very easily through Steam via the Library menu or the tiny ""VR"" button on the top right of the Steam client window. That button also closes SteamVR in case you're curious.  Finally, the headset is a little uncomfortable at first and requires a lot of customization and/or adjustment.The games currently out are amazingly fun.  I also find it fun to develop for the platform.  Valve did a great job with the SteamVR open source libraries and official Unity and UE4 plug-ins.  The documentation for said plug-ins is very well maintained and examples of usage are easy to find.  My favorite games so far are Tilt Brush (included with the Vive purchase) and Rec Room (free).  I also love New retro Arcade Neon, but it requires a lot of setup in order to make it how it's supposed to be and it isn't as playable as I'd like due to VR performance issues and laggy input on the arcade cabinets.  There are already some VR modeling tools and a lot of physics playground apps.  I don't have it yet, but Job Simulator looks hilarious, and Accounting is a freebie I thought was too short-lived but was definitely a good experience.You're going to save on shipping buying with Amazon Prime rather than directly through HTC, but you will still have to pay tax on this, so be prepared for that.  You may be better off buying a used one from Ebay, where I've seen barely used Vives still in their packaging sold for $650.  It's definitely worth a try to shop around for this.

Absurdly fun. I can hardly play my favorite 2d games anymore, which I once found so fantastic. This headset will let you watch a movie in a home theater you can't afford, get you laid by women you could never approach otherwise, and then play games that use your own body as the controller. Make no mistake this hardware is in its infancy, there are many faults, but the experience is unlike anything. We are the first generation to experience VR, and right now you have to pay a premium to experience it. I can only tell you the premium is worth it.

Absolutely awesome when paired with the GTX 1080. You might look like a goof while playing, but it's definitely worth it. Only negatives I've found so far is that text isn't very sharp and there aren't really many high quality games out yet, mostly just expensive tech demos, but even those are awesome. Space pirate trainer is great!

Great product. Works as expected, no problems in it at all.Just be careful with the HTC VIVE software, as it install a network driver that might slow your connection. If you uninstall it it should go back to normal, and it is not really needed to use the vive. As this is not related to the product, 5 stars = )Thank you

I am not new to VR, I had an Oculus Dev Kit and was familiar with VR, its capabilities and shortfalls. I can tell you this system is nothing short of fantastic! HTC should be commended for great hardware, and Steam VR is a great conduit to download/play games. The initial setup was a bit challenging with the firmware updates for controllers/base stations and setting up the room and positioning the bases (used wall mounts @ 45 deg opposed to ea other 78in high). If you have no tech or computer skills get a friend to help with this portion. I will tell you that after that is done...it is worth it. Be prepared for some mind blowing VR experiences..Would give it 5 stars, but setup info was sketchy at best, otherwise GREAT product!

Obviously a very cool system and when it's working, it's awesome.  There are surprisingly a good number of games for this, but many are similar.  My biggest complaint is that we only played it very lightly for a week before the headset broke.  We've sent it out for repair (it's under warranty but I'm annoyed that we are responsible for paying for shipping) and hoping it comes back ready to play.

Cat chewed through the $40 HDMI cable almost immediately, but the console itself is everything you ever wanted in a VR system. It's immersive and gloriously well-detailed in graphics. I especially love the ""family room"" entrance foyer to the games--ingenious way to immerse users right off the bat. This was our family's ""big present"" to ourselves this Christmas, and nobody regrets this purchase at all.Dangit though I wish Amazon had a next-day delivery option for those HDMI cables...

Update 3/14/2018:It's been 3 weeks today from the time HTC signed for my headset. So far, I haven't received a useful update other than my unit is in their ""queue"" a few weeks ago, despite asking several times for an updated status on my repair. This is highly discouraging.Update 3/9/2018:It's been 17 days since HTC signed for my headset. A week ago I sent an email to their customer support email (vive_care@vive.com) asking for an update and they told me their web repair tracker is broken, but that they see my unit in their ""queue"". Since then I haven't heard anything. I asked for another update a day ago, but so far I haven't heard back. So I guess it's good that they acknowledged receiving my headset but it sure would be nice for them to let me know where things stand with it. 17 days is obviously well beyond the 7 to 10 days they told me it would take to repair my headset. Still waiting for an update...Update 2/27/2018:I've sent in my unit for repair and they signed for it a week ago, but according to their repair site, they never received the unit. I chatted with several of their reps (you can't call these people), and they both said that they probably have it and the repair site is probably not accurate. That's not very comforting. I was told in my initial chat with support they would reach out after receiving the unit to provide a repair estimate. A week after they signed for my unit, I've received no communication nor update of any kind, other than the useless vague updates I'm getting by chatting with chat agents. During my initial contact with their support chat, they said it takes 7 to 10 days to get the device repair and returned, and so far, I haven't heard a peep.Because of my initial review below, they asked me to email them my ticket information, so I did. I'm hopeful I will get a response and I'm hopeful it's not more bad news.Initial Review:Used about 10 hours over 1 year. This week, I decided to hook it back up. It had been safely packed up for about 6 months on a self, but when I reconnected everything, the right eye on the headset had a vertical green line. In chatting with Vive support, which are very friendly, the unit was diagnosed a defective. What's worst is I'm 30 days beyond my 12-month warranty, so I have to pay for any repairs. According to the Vive rep, even if I was in warranty, I may still have to pay for repairs depending on what they found.I'm disappointed in the quality of the unit, since it only worked for about 10 hours for me then become defective. I'm disappointed that I have to pay to fix what is obviously a faulty right-eye display, which I would expect to last more than 10 hours. I'll pay to fix it, unless the cost is more than buying another one off eBay.

I want to give this product a 5 star but unfortunately I was hardly able to play due to me accidently dropping one of the controllers, LITERALLY about a foot off the ground and it wouldnt turn on again. I didnt even get to play a single game before it had broke. Had to send it back which has taken longer than i had ever expected because the package was going about 1 state over. I will be buying another with my refund money but if you buy this product i would highly recommend taking absolute precautions when using and buy a protective case for the controllers if you have the extra money to invest

The system is great, but after two weeks, one of my controllers would not stay charged for more than 30 minutes. Tried repairing, resetting, fully charging while halfway charged and while completely dead, tried the charger for my other controller, no physical damage is on the controller. Called into HTC support multiple times and I'm told they can repair it or replace it and that I'll receive packaging slip in the mail, but received nothing. I asked for a ticket number and was told that my phone number is used to track it. After not receiving anything, I called in and was told I needed a ticket number and that it isn't tracked with phone numbers. Was told that they would open a new ticket and that I should be receiving an email with the ticket and packaging number, so I had them stay on the phone, after several minutes they said they were experiencing issues and said they would call me back in an hour when the system was back up. Never received a call back. Went through the same process 2 more times before I gave up. Ended up buying another controller, but not worth owning if something dies out of the box and I need to pay another $150 for a new controller just so I can use it.

You might think you could imagine what it's like but trust me....you cant! It would be easy to dismiss this technology as a fad until you ""strap on the headset""....i recommend a grx1080 for butter smoother frame rates.

This thing is absolutely amazing. You really will feel like you're inside the game. Putting it on will take you to another place. Some games are gimmicky but you can say that about any system. Every day independent developers come up with new experiences for the Vive and you can explore steam to shop for these amazing applications, many of which are free. Google Earth in VR is absolutely breath taking. Even Counterstrike players need to try this for the killer app ""Onward"", a military FPS where you are put in the shoes of a solider like never before.+ The most premium VR experience on the consumer market.+ This is the official device for Steam VR.+ Tons of software available.+ Quality of the tracking is amazing 99% of the time.- Controller sensors are still prone to occlusion and will sometimes drift.- Imperfections in the Sub Pixel Array are common in the manufacturing process. I've tested 4 individual Vive units and each one had between 2 and 6 dead or dim sub-pixels. That's 1 to 3 per eye. I suspect this is the norm for these units and most people will simply never notice as these flaws can be difficult to detect under normal use if you aren't looking for it (or don't know what to look for).Buy one before President Trump puts a 50% tax on imported goods and the price becomes $1200, lol...

A notable improvement over the first generation Vive.  If spending $800 on other things can improve your system and gaming experience in other ways this headset upgrade should be last on your list.  But if nothing in your rig is performance bottle necked, you've got the original Vive with it's terrible strap, and you want to take a deep dive into Skyrim VR, you won't regret doing it with this significantly upgraded headset.  The strap is so much more comfortable, text is very readable, and the ""screen door effect"" fades into the background almost instantly.

I spoke to customer service several times and they always said the same thing, ""We are sorry for the delay, your repair has been escalated to a higher priority"".

Ordered it during a one day promotion, was supposed to receive better headphone strap, fallout 4, tilt brush, and a $100 gift card.  When the box came all I got was Fallout and Tilt brush.  After hours texting and calling they kept saying they couldn't make an exception.  I don't want an exception, I just want exactly what I paid for.  Finally they said they would gift card me the $100 but no head strap.  The person you talk to on the phone doesn't have the power to make it right, at best they agree to send it to another department who make a decree.  I noticed another review with a similar problem.  So discouraging.  After this I don't know how you can ever trust that you will receive what a promotion promised.Now after less than two weeks a common problem has cropped up with the touch pad on a controller and amazon says they will accept it back for a refund but won't exchange.  Which means I lose the $100 gift card and have to buy back a new vive at full price.  Vive will fix the controller, but  people say it takes weeks.Easily my worst Amazon experience, maybe things are changing with them.The Vive itself.  I like it.  I expect the resolution to be improved every couple years.  The controller problem seems to be super common.  I recommend an extended warranty.  I think the controllers are around $120 each.  I'm missing the better head band, they made it for a reason.

After two years of ownership, I can’t really recommend it. It’s great when it works, but if it works is utterly random and or determined by solar and planetary alignments. On occasion I will attempt to use it but end up spending three+ hours attempting to troubleshoot issues. These issues will appear suddenly, even if the day before it was functioning. Then after the hours of frustration I’ll give up, a week later I’ll revisit feeling like playing, having made no system changes, and it will just suddenly work. This is an issue I’ve had since first day of ownership. For such intermittent problems I just can’t see myself recommending one, and my eventual replacement will absolutely not have any “Vive” branding.

Let's start this off by saying I played pong,when I was a kid, when it first came out. That being said, I have played almost every console there is and never grew out of games. When I saw a video on this and other vr's I thought, man it's like,lookin at a game with goggles so I neglected to get this when it came out. My brother has it and I tried it at his house and was blown away, like I went out next day and had a $2700 system built just so I could play it blown away. Well it came today and my legs are tired and I have no more sweat, it's all in the headband. So I finally let my 8 year old play and I don't think I will ever get a chance again to play.  The graphics are good, the sound good, and the realism is something that your brain won't be able to handle. I stood on a cliff in google maps and couldn't bring myself to jump, I knew floor was there but brain said a big F you.

My only other real VR experience before this was Dactyl Nightmare on a Virtuality headset back in the 90s so I don't know how this compares to Oculus or any of the other headsets out right now but I really like it. There is a good amount of content and you can play a lot of Oculus-only titles using Revive. There are even a few good local multiplayer games that let people without a HMD participate.

While this is the most expensive VR system on the market today, after using the Vive for a month I am fully convinced that I chose correctly. Amazon sells this product as a ""Virtual Reality System"", and the terminology is spot-on. Unlike the Oculus Rift or PSVR ""headsets"", I find that the HTC Vive does an outstanding job of tracking in a 3D space, which is called roomscale. The HTV Vive accomplishes this using two Lighthouses, which send IR lasers across the room, which the sensors on the headsets and wands pick up. I find that this approach is far more reliable and accurate than the camera-based Rift and PSVR and it doesn't consume much USB bandwidth. I found that my brain was quickly tricked into thinking that I was in a virtual space. Games that require you to pull a sword off your back or a take a pistol from your hip greatly increase this immersion.This is first-gen tech and it's very new, so there are improvements that need to be made. Some tips:* I strongly recommend that you replace the default face-foam with the 6mm foam from VR Cover.* Ignore the instructions and don't install Viveport; its buggy and you don't need it -- just install SteamVR and you'll be all set.* Download OpenVR Advanced Settings Dashboard Overlay from matzman666 on Github. This is a handy tool that enhances SteamVR and allows you to tweak your virtual environment beyond SteamVR's settings.* Join the /r/Vive subreddit and read their guides and general commentary. There's a lot of information there that can be very useful to a new user.

As a system, the Vive is pretty awesome.  However, one of the reasons I purchased this was because it was advertised to come with a copy of Fallout 4 VR.  Even today, as I type this, Amazon still advertises that it comes with that.  However, this is not true, and no copy of Fallout 4 is available any longer.  I contacted Amazon and explained that I paid for Fallout 4 and expected to get it, and that I paid Amazon not HTC, so I didn't care where the code should have been fulfilled, only that I felt my contract with Amazon had been broken.  I offered to let them reimburse me for a game or to send me a copy of the game, but they refused.  Now I need to decide if I am going to send this back for a refund or not.  I am betting it would cost them less to give me the game than it will cost them to repack and restock this item.  I have usually been happy with amazon, but I am pretty ticked right now.

So here's the thing, I loved the Vive, it's an amazing pice of technology, but in my opinion the tech isn't quite there yet, but only so. It's so close. First let's talk about the lenses.They aren't glass but plastic and you have to be EXTREAMLY gentle with them or you will scratch them. You have to wet the cleaning cloth it comes with before you wipe it down becuase a dry cloth of any kind (including shirts) will scratch it. If you wear glasses or anyone who uses it has glasses you have to be careful when putting it on or you'll scratch it, wich brings me to my other point. The edge of the lenses have this effect that, no matter how close, how much you adjust the IPP won't go away. The edges kind of ghost and god ray a bit. The screen itself is also a problem for me. There is a noticeable screen door effect with the headset, it's no different then staring at your monitor extreamly close. It becomes less noticeable while in game but it's still there, a problem I found was in game text was hard to read due to the screen door effect and objects far away become far less detailed.The games for it are alright. The Lab is the most fun I've had in a game in a long time, but most just feel like glorified tech demos.I was extreamly excited to get my Vive, I played with the thing for hours upon hours. But at the end of the day it wasn't worth the asking price due to the care the lenses take. And you WILL scratch them. If your wondering about the lense problem google it and decide for yourself. I will purchase a Vive again becuase it's far superior to the Oculos Rift (and touch) but I will be waiting for the second gen version.

Exceeds expectations, really spectacular experience.  The one downside is the computer hardware required to run it.  We have a gaming laptop with I7 processors so I thought it would be fine.  Unfortunately the graphics card is last generation and the Vive wants latest and greatest of everything so I need to buy another computer or spend another $800 or so to upgrade the graphics card.The computer will run it but it has just enough lag or something that it can give you motion sickness when playing certain games.  Definitely the only complaint and it's not really related to the product.

Received old model, manufactured in 2016. HDMI cable port didn't work correctly in the first time. With nVidia geForce 980 Ti, intel core i7-4790, the HMD showed only black screen, though it was clearly recognized via USB connection. Worked for 3 weeks making this to work. Bought $200 worth of HDMI cables for testing. Found out HDMI port in the HMD device was somewhat very vulnerable to noise of natural cause, and thus only had maximum working HDMI cable length of 1m. This didn't make any sense. Finally got THE solution by using powered HDMI cable. Bought 7m powered HDMI cable and connected the HMD and my PC directly with it. Worked without any more frustrating problems. Case closed.Summary: If your HMD gone wrong and the screen won't out, just buy a powered HDMI cable (the one with thicker cable) and connect the HMD directly to your graphics card.

It has been integrated with Steam perfectly in my opinion. The software allows a very immersive experience. I was able to set it up in ~25 minutes and start the tutorial.If I had to pick a negative, I'd say it should have some kind of ventilation in the headset, as I think I steam up the lenses when things get intense.

I have owned the Vive now for about 4 months, and considering the price, it does indeed put somewhat of a dent in your wallet. That being the case, I went up and down the steam VR store searching for all the freebie VR apps and software that go with it. There is a lot of great freeware, such as Google Earth VR, and several other titles that give you some short films or animations that look really nice.However, it has only been in the last month or two where I've really gotten excited about the Vive, and when did this happen? When I finally decided to try some of the paid titles on steam, this is where the system really shines. Some titles I have that I love:AeroFly FS 2 Flight Simulator with VR built into the simulator, paired with a Thrustmaster HOTAS. This is a native VR program where you fly around California, Nevada, and Utah, with other expansions packs available. Verdict? Mindblowing, as you really feel you're in and flying a real plane.Lunar Flight, where you do missions on the moon, very difficult at first but very rewarding as you get better flying the moon module.Soundbox, AudioShield, and Holodance, where you punch different colored balls as they hurl toward you to just about any music you like, the whole point with these programs is they give you a great workout while having tons of fun. These applications are my most recent discovery and these alone are excuse enough to own the Vive, again, you can work up a real sweat while having a blast exercising.The Vive really shines too with some of the educational software, such as Titans of Space and Apollo 11. There are several other excellent titles too, where basically, you are flying in a space ship or craft of some sort and a narrated guide takes you on a tour of the solar system and many of the planets and its a fun way to learn, whether you are a child or adult.The only couple of reasons why I'd really like to fine tune my rating to 4.5 stars is Vive Customer service seems a little off, they gave me some promotional bonus for a free game(s) where the code didn't work and then went in circles trying to get it to work so I eventually gave up.Also, as some others have said, I wouldn't bother with the Vive store, knowing what I know now I'd just stick with getting my Vive games/programs from Steam.The other thing to be aware of is there is a screen door effect, so the graphics aren't as crisp as say, playing regular 2D games. I'm guessing in the next generation of VR hardware they'll be improving the clarity or crispness. Also, I don't have the latest and greatest Nvidea 1080 graphics card, though I do have the 1060 which I think is still pretty recent. Still, for the VR aspect, the system as a whole is well worth it to me and mindblowing.Finally, you might want to keep in mind that HTC is releasing a new Stand Alone VR headset, supposedly by or before the end of this year (2017) which will be self-contained so you don't need and expensive PC to run it.In conclusion, I have no regrets at all with the Vive and use it at least for a little while every day, so much to do and so much fun!

I really struggled between 2 and 3 stars. It's so much fun, but I spend way too much time getting things to work right--not just the setup mind you. Even now that's it's all setup it stops working for no reason and the firmware has to be re-updated, which ALWAYS fails the first 4 or 5 times (takes about 30 minutes to get together). I'm starting to think I have a bad unit, though. But my experience with HTC customer service is so bad, I dread trying to do that.The Chat support is often offline, and when you call, they can't help you out and don't have any idea when it will be back online. Each call takes an hour, as they just have you go over the same things each call, even if you already tried them, or they don't apply to your issue.I got a bad controller and they made me pay for return shipping myself, even though it was bad out of the box. Then they give you so many restrictions, that I'm not even sure if they'll replace it for me (thing like, don't ship in a larger box than needed or they won't return it, if there's any sign of damage they won't return it, etc).Don't get me wrong when it works it's great. I used the first developer's release of the Oculus and this is soooo much better. But it seems like I spend half my time trying to get it to work, and for a $700 product the service leaves tons to be desired.Bottom Line: It's really for early adopters only.

I received the Vive Pro kit on May 10th. I was super excited to try it out as this was my first VR system. Unfortunately, one of the 2.0 base stations was dead upon arrival. I contacted HTC support and after 2 hours of troubleshooting they deemed the base station faulty. They then recommended that I return the kit.I have since begun the process of returning the kit for a replacement and it has gone smoothly. I expect to receive a new kit within the week. It sucks to have to pay so much for this kit and an essential part of the system to be dead on arrival. However, it may have been an oddity.Also HTC needs to update their installer for this kit. The installer has the Vive Pro headset in the installer. It didn't change the trackers which do not have channel indicators and it didn't update the LED light identifiers.Overall I had a blast for my first VR experience. It's a shame that I have to spend so long without it.Update: I have recieved my new Vive Pro as of 5/17/18 and all of the components are fully working. I'm very glad that Amazon's returns are extremely prompt and very easy to do.

I really like this product but I have a problem where one controller won't click properly on the track pad and I'm not sure how to contact the seller. When this issue is resolved I'll update this review. This issue developed after about one week's use and is apparently a common defect in Vive controllers. While it's possible to repair it yourself, it voids the warranty, so I'd like to see if I can have just the controller replaced or repaired. Considering about 10% of the reviews here are 1-star reviews, and when you read through them, it's mostly complaints about the controller breaking in this way (track pad doesn't click on one side), it's an issue that affects around 10% of customers. Support is generally unhelpful so you might want to look into Newegg's warranty, but we'll see if things work out for me. Else it's $120 for a new controller.Edit: I did get a new controller and it's been working great. I've updated my rating because I do like this headset a lot. There is a new cordless one coming out so it might be worth waiting for that.

It is a frustrating piece of technology.  It works, mostly, but ever time we want to use it I spend about 1 hour figuring out how to get it working again.  It seems that ""glitches"" are very common.I am a software engineer and I can usually get  it working again, but I am not sure how someone without extensive experience with technical systems would ever find it enjoyable.I would view this as more of a prototype than a consumer ready product.  The idea is there the implementation is not.  :(I am updating this a year later, system still is unstable.  I am trying to use it today only to have the same ""disk write error"" issues I have had all year.If you truly want something you can just play, get something for a console like the VR for the PS.  Unless you are a hardcore gamer willing to put in a couple of hours every few weeks to keep it working, it is just not worth it.

It's much more intense on the visuals which is great. Text is much easier to make out and it makes the games more immersive. Fit is good as they changed the weight distribution with the re-designed headgear. Hopefully it lasts for a long time as it's very expensive. Will recommend to my friends!

Screen door is gone. All but the smallest text is readable. Feels roughly equivalent to a 1080p monitor. Seems to seal out the light better. The thinner, lighter cable is nice. Running a GTX 1080.It doesn't have an on-board peripheral USB port like the original VIVE did, so USB mods (fans, etc.) won't work without additional cabling. There is a button on the headset, opposite of the volume buttons, that has a funny symbol but I have no idea what it does. It doesn't appear to be documented anywhere.Edit: one USB c port is hidden next to the cable under the foam.

I've been gaming since the PlayStation 1 days, and VR was entirely new way for me to perceive gaming.About me: I'm a PC gamer who enjoys the more competitive, ""twitch reaction"" type games like Counter-Strike, Overwatch, and occasionally PUBG. I'll say now for the more competitive player market, the VIVE (and VR in general) is really suited towards causal gamers. You really can't have skill based games with the physical limitations of VR--compared to good ol' fashion mouse and keyboard. Definitely has a cool factor and there are challenging games like SUPERHOT that can test your reactions, but it's really hard to justify $800 for something that hardly satisfy my personal gaming needs.As for the actual experience, it's not entirely immersive from what I was expecting. You can still see the black outer edge of the headset when you're wearing it. Best way I could describe it is looking through a pair of binoculars.

For those of you who aren't sure about purchasing the HTC VIVE:I wasn't sure myself. I've followed the VR scene very closely for about 5 years now and was worried that the VIVE wouldn't meet my expectations of what I want virtual reality to be. It didn't meet what I had set myself up for, which was some insane, crazy technology that would bring about the next generation of competitive gaming that was at a level of completely free movement and involvement. I'm HUGE into competitive gaming (CoD, Battlefield, SMITE, League of Legends....I've practically tried every shooter, MMO, and MOBA on the market today) and frankly don't stray from the competitive scene very often at all. Unfortunately the VIVE is restrictive on movement for now, at least until the wireless transmitter pack hits the consumer market. This coupled with the fact that the headset doesn't quite fit my face as well as I'd hope and slips around slightly during gameplay, making it hard to look directly downward is somewhat annoying to deal with at times.HOWEVER, this was absolutely worth the purchase and is fairly priced for what you're getting for your buck. Possibly the most impressive part of the entire system is that it's tracking of the controllers is SPOT ON. There is absolutely no lag at all on my system. In fact, with the headset on in most games I can throw the controller in the air and catch it in the opposite hand because of how accurately tracked the controllers are when you see them in games. This device alone has reinvigorated a childlike wonderment in me that has been absent for far too long. Is my movement restricted while moving? Yes. Am I going to see some hyper competitive, hardcore gameplay that is by my standard perfectly tuned and natural feeling? Probably not. Has using this product been THE most magical experience I've ever had in my 20 years of gaming? ABSOLUTELY! (I'm 22 years old. Believe it or not I was playing Tomb Raider by age 2 on the Playstation 1. Whether or not that was a bad parenting choice on the part of my parents is another conversation haha). It is quite honestly an extraordinary experience and will show you that this is definitely the way gaming will be heading in the future. You wouldn't believe how immersed you'll get even when you know there are cords hanging off the back of your head. This device isn't going to bring about the Sword Art Online universe that you, and I, are way too excited about becoming a possibility some day. In fact that's probably another 30 or 40 so years off until we have stable versions of such technology if you want my educated opinion (I have a Computer Science degree with a minor in Neurobiology and have participated in many studies with a select few companies actively seeking to bring about something of the sort). However, don't be dissuaded by that notion.All together if you're considering getting the HTC VIVE and aren't sure if it's worth the money, let me be the first of many to tell you it absolutely is. It is an utterly magical experience using it for the first time, and continues to be so with every new game I try. The HTC Vive is frankly an huge step for the VR scene, buying one will be an investment into the future of the VR market, and it is an astounding experience in of itself using the technology. It's extremely immersive, unnervingly so at times, and will help show you that there is definitely a place for VR games in the future. Hopefully you decide to pick one up and have just as much of a blast as I have been!

Spending $600 on this headset is a gamble. If you're the betting type then go ahead and get it but for those who like to know they're getting a quality product when they spend a week's paycheck on a shiny new piece of tech think twice before impulse buying.I had my headset FOUR DAYS before a lighthouse got a blinking red light, indicating an internal problem with the hardware. There is no end-user fix for this as it means one of the lasers or sensors is going bad. HTC support told me that their ONLY option was for me to send my lighthouse out for repair, which could take up to four weeks if all went well, or longer if other people on twitter and these reviews are to be believed (like several months longer). To me, this is absolutely unacceptable. why couldn't they just send me a new lighthouse in exchange for the defective one? When I requested an exchange from Amazon they sent me out an entire brand new system THAT DAY and shipped it ON A SUNDAY, and all they ask is that I return the defective unit within 30 days! NOW THAT IS CUSTOMER SERVICE.Aside from the disgusting customer service, the headset is fantastic but without customer service to back it up I have zero confidence in this product. The only reason I went for an exchange instead of a refund is because I had already bought some VR games and set up a room just for this so I figured I'd give it one more shot.Hopefully if this new set is going to break it happens within Amazon's return window because then I'll just get a Rift instead.

Unbelievable and incredibly fun. I recently brought the RIFT then returned it and got the VIVE because I knew even with the RIFT setups for motion VR that the tracking would be the difference. Since the VIVE light houses use laser its incredibly accurate. In any case a few things stood out from me compared to the rift.1-The rift almost made me barf a couple times - I dont know why but certain games without room scale was just barf city.2-The rift didnt have sufficient room for my glasses.3-The rift GOD RAYS were increasingly noticeable the more you used it.Few things about the VIVE, be prepared for a much longer setup1-Updating your firmware on all the VIVE equipment.2-Mounting the Lighthouses. Despite the infamous setups with ridiculous poles hanging inside the home I went with a simpler solution. I went to home depot and picked up 2 small pieces of wood. Mounted the Light Houses to the wood then used Scotch heavy duty sticky Velcro tape (15LBS)  to attach the wood to the wall. Incredibly sturdy and I can remove it if needed.After all was said and done and I got to playing I noticed a few things1-Clearer picture - no more god rays.2-Way less motion sickness. I believe this is more to do with room scale and the tracking being so accurate. Just awesome.3-A lot more fun. Just playing the ""LAB"" and its 12 mini games was amazing. My wife who is not even a gamer was having a blast with the arrow game super fun to watch her enjoy it.Don't blink, get the Vive over the Rift - I dealt with this decision for 3 weeks, had the Rift for 2 weeks and while it is great the Vive is just MUCH better.

God-awful waste of money and time.  The quality, while maybe it's decent for VR, is terrible.  Like looking through a screen door at a fuzzy picture across the room.  Difficult to setup and limited in functionality.  VR's potential is huge, but right now the technology is one generation past the car-equivalent of the Model T.I've not used the Occulus Rift, but I can't conceive how this could be a better enough device to warrant double the price tag.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone other than people with kids and lots of throw away money.  Not because it doesn't work, but because the quality and ease of use is just not there.

Its very well made does not feel cheap at all. The resolution is a bit disappointing for hype and price.  The lenses are visible in brighter content and becomes a distraction. There is a very small sweet spot in view angle and ipd. Even at full setting on view distance you can see eye pieces which take away from submersion and feels like looking at a vr world on other side of goggle shaped window rather than in it. I was a test owner in 96 when cybermax was released and aside from very low 300x200 resolution the 1996 version was better hmd. Perhaps the 4k version at ces this year can balance quality and price with performance.

Absolutely amazing. This took a bit of time to set up, and although I had checked my system prior to purchase, I neglected to check if I had a spare HDMI port on my 980Ti graphics card. Lacking a mini DP cable, I had to unplug my monitor and use remote desktop to complete the installation, but once I got it working I couldn't believe how immersive the experience was. Really, the thing that sets the VIVE apart are the controllers, which are extremely responsive and have precise force feedback, to the point where it feels like you are interacting with objects of various materials. For example, there is a minigame in the Lab app where you have to pull down a lever to open a door, and you can see and feel the clicks of the gears in the virtual mechanism as you do so. There is also a bow and arrow game where it actually feels like you are scraping a wood arrow against a wood bow. I was really not expecting such tactile detail, and until we hear otherwise, these are the only controllers on the market that can offer that degree of fidelity.The negatives to this is there aren't that many games out there yet, made worse by the fact that Oculus content isn't compatible with SteamVR, but with a little research there are third party programs to help with this. Also, 3D movies (I recommend Whirligig player) are not easy to find. We can't just purchase the Lego movie in 3D on Amazon and have it play on the Vive just yet, but I suspect that will change as Netflix and Hulu will be offering original VR content. In addition, SteamVR isn't exactly a slick interface. I kind of wish it were a little more utilitarian and immersive (it's just a flat panel that pops up and you navigate by awkwardly pointing a laser instead of touching the objects in 3D). That said, I am happy I went with this over the closed ecosystem of Oculus, but this is a very tough choice as far as content is concerned. Ultimately I made a judgement that Steam will win out in the end, but it seams Oculus got a bit of a head start over the VIVE despite its lack of controller support.This certainly is not a replacement for a traditional gaming monitor, and getting content to work outside of the SteamVR or Viveport stores is pretty difficult, but if you have a gaming rig capable of running VR and a little patience, I highly recommend that you drop everything and purchase the VIVE. Seriously, sell a kidney if you must... You need this more.

Let;s be honest. It's an experience, a good one at times. But god forbid you use Wifi. After buying many multiplayer games (star trek bridge commander for example) That requires a solid connection, I've managed to get about 7 minutes of play time since my Vive arrived  on it. People will say switch to 5ghz, For some it works, others say buy some piece of hardware...sure i could, but no. I've invested more than enough into this system. The controllers are fundamentally flawed in such a way that if you're on wifi 2.4ghz or in a neighborhood or apartment complex with neighbors running both 2.4 and 5ghz wifi, well you're boned, no internet play for you without running an Ethernet cable to your pc. So that's my gripe, That ALONE is what's taking 2 stars off. And believe me, you'll understand once you've experienced it.

I think currently there are three methods of getting vr in our home.  In my opinion windows mixed reality needs more time in the oven.  That leaves vive and occulus.  Now that i recieved this i decided to keep it since they already released 2nd version.  I now am starting to think occulus would of been a better way to go.  The htc is heavier and controllers are not comfortable, accessories are extremely expensive for simple things like body sensors, speakers and controllers.  First occulus is $100 cheaper has better controllers and audio looks much better setup.  Also the cost of the new headset is high they false claim its pro or business is bullshit.  Its like claiming high end gaming laptop is business class.  I look at setup of occulus easier.

While I only gave it two stars, for me, this has been a wonderful product.  An amazing experience, the vive is something out of this world!  Why do I give it two stars then, well that is because all this time I have owned it since September, I thought the controllers worked a certain way by default.  It turns out that while I thought everything was perfect, in-spite that the track-pads on my controllers couldn't be pressed to the right, that it was only a problem with my controllers and not intentional by design--thus, I received a defective unit unknowingly.  All 8 of my friends who own this product have shown me that their trackpad works great in whatever direction it's pressed--unlike mine which doesn't work when pressed to the right! .. according to the cost of their controllers, I am going to have to cough up $260.00 to replace them, although I received a defective product--something I just can't bring myself to doing, just because of the principle of it.  Oh well. . .

This is as big of game changer as the Atari. Excellent for those who wish to be more active yet love their games.If you're considering the Vive or Oculus, please consider this:Go on steam, pull up any VR game, and read the negative reviews. You will find a majority of them are from Oculus users.If that is not a sell for you, watch steam for a week, and see how many VR games are released in that week, compare to any other platform, while at it, compare costs of games as well.Still not sure? Go use a Playstation VR, an Oculus VR, and a Vive Vr. I actually did all 3 before purchasing my vive. Playstation graphics are garbage. Oculus and Vive are similar, Vive has more graphic and physical customization.

Owned for 7 days before the base station started the red blink of death.  Only got to play it for 2 of those days.  HTC requires that you send the base station in on your OWN DIME to get repaired before sending it back.

After months of waiting, researching and weighing the pros, cons and reviews of the two competing VR systems (Vive and Oculus), I took the plunge and got the Vive.  I have not regretted it.  The VR experience is very, very cool, and the first time you try it you will be blown away.A few caveats- setup can be a bit of a handful if you're expecting a plug-n-play experience.  That's not to say it's terrible, but setup involves mounting base stations in your room at the correct height and angle (think drill/drywall anchor, etc), installing Steam and Steam VR (though many gamers will already have it), and in my case, updating the firmware on both headset and controllers before they would be recognized by the base stations.  There was also an issue with the hardware working better on USB 2.0 and not 3.0 (who knows why).  After some trial and error, it worked, and it was awesome.Other caveats: you probably know this, but a good gaming PC is a must.  The GPU is by far the most important component here, and if you have a recent-ish CPU (say a core i7 or i5 from the last few years), you'll be fine on that end, but a newer GPU (think GTX 1060, 1070 or 1080) will make all of the difference.  The last point to consider is the library of games and apps- there are TONS of them on Steam, but of course this is first-generation.  There is currently no ""killer app"" or ""must-have"" games, but there is a wealth of amazing content.  Just try TheBlu or Tilt Brush and you'll Be blown away.

So... like may people who are reading this review, I literally spent months debating which of the high-end VR headsets to invest in. After watching many, many Youtube reviews and watching hours of other people playing in VR, I finally took the leap and purchased the HTC Vive. I was worried that my computer would be unable to handle the Vive and that I would end up needing to invest thousands more into a high-end set-up. My current system is a Core i5 2320 (Sandy Bridge), with 8 GIGS of DDR3, an EVGA GTX 970, and a 250 GIG SSD with a 3 TB drive linked into my Steam library - very happy to report that this setup has been able to run 95% of the games I have tried so far flawlessly... the only two that it ""stuttered"" a bit on were Universe Sandbox 2 (only when I collided multiple stars and created a super nova) and a tad bit in the Nvidia VR Funhouse (but given the graphics and physics at play, I was not at all surprised). Other games, like Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades, Google Tiltbrush, Zombie Simulator, The Lab, and Call of the Starseed have run extremely well.The feeling of ""presence"" that you get in this device is impossible to convey, so I will not even try... let's just say as a 40-something IT professional that has had a computer gaming hobby dating back to the Commodore VIC 20 days, I was amazed... it's not perfect, as there are ""God rays"" and some screen door effects... but the flawless tracking, coupled with the room-scale interaction, make these easily ignored as you become engrossed with the environment you are in. Stepping into this level of VR for the first time was definitely one of those ""OMG"" moments that leaves you a bit speechless. The setup was very easy and I am able to play for many hours at a stretch without any discomfort.I would definitely recommend this device to others... simply put, it is an amazing experience and I am greatly looking forward to watching the VR industry mature - great stuff. Good luck and happy VRing!

Spent the full 600$ on it.Not even new, its got marks on the controllers and headset, so it's pretty obvious. Didnt mind, nothing seems to be broken. But then the annoying part.The viveport code that is sent with it has been used. So no free 2 months of viveport or Fallout 4 VR.Why would I want to spend another 125$, if not for the expectation that my new purchase is what it says it is.

Ended up spending so much money  after realizing our brand new laptop would not support the software. We ended up buying buying a new laptop that would support the software and tripods for the sensors that it ended up being a ridiculously expensive Christmas present. I was not planning on spending so much money but what are you gonna do after buying something this hyped up and assuming your brand new laptop will support it. My mistake all the way. Highly suggest you make quadruple sure your computer can handle this kind of software before anyone buys. Pretty cool once you get it going. Lol

It's a lot of fun, but the base station broke before I'd even used the system for a full hour. The RMA process is a long drawn out affair which I wouldn't expect from a company the size of HTC.

Absolutely worst customer service i have ever encountered! First off, i was supposed to get Fallout 4 for free with my purchase. Nope... second off there is no phone number for Vive customer service. Only an online chat. Those people must be talking to 20 people at once because it takes forever for them to respond to you.. finally they told me after 40 minutes of waiting to connect to a rep and then having a convo im told to email there support line for assistance on my problem with not having received a code. Then after 2 days and i responded within 45 minutes of each email they sent on my phone. They told me they did t have a code for me because the experation date was march 31st and i bought mine on april first. I explained that it was advertised and furthermore there was no notice of expiration or fine print (i have photo evidence incase they requested to see it). Then i stopped getting responses. And recieved a survey which i explained this all here and said i would rethink my opinion if someone contacted me regarding my issue (maybe it was just the ""lady"" i emailed) 24 hours later i received another survey as if they closed my previous callback and wanted a follow up on the previous survey.... this is where i stand. The company took my money no problem but failed to admit their mistake and honor it. Now they are asking people to spend 800 dollars on just a headset? Not including new controllers or sensors that are to be released way later in n the year? They want to sell a bundle of a new headset and old hardware to clear their inventory before they release versions 2.0 of the new sensors and controllers.. they arent even budging on price for the old stuff and new headset. They just combined the two into a 1 click package.This company is all about money. They dont care how they get it and they dont care about their consumers. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK, RESEARCH OTHER PEOPLES CUSTOMER SERVICE ENCOUNTERS BEFORE YOU INVEST. Seriously reddit is loaded with complaints and after mu experience i believe them 120%.Ohh and there seems to be a connection issue everytime i want to play. Idk if its the Vive, steam, or steam vr. Bluetooth didnt wanna connect for the longest time to my sensors, and the touch pads are crazy sensitive. Much rather have a stick and individual buttons. Lastly, the strap on yhe headset always feels like its not on my head all the way and its gonna fall off if i sneeze to hard. The rift felt much better and so does the PSVR. The strap stays above halfway on the back of your head.Im shocked, i had really high hopes for this system truly but my experience is just.. the worst experience ive ever had with a product that cost so much money and the customer service to resolve any issue. I dont say this lightly, im a pretty positive person and try to see the brighter side of things and have an understanding of the whats and whys of what goes on. But i simply cant be postivie about this product or company at all..Update: i read some more reviews, and im shocked to find out that i was told March31st was the deadline but people are claiming that HTC also refused them as well for dates prior to what i was told. Now i know for a fact through my experience and past reviews this company plain out lies and deceives their customers! Even if the product was amazing, that right there stops me from wanting to keep it. God forbit i have an issue. Filing an RMA would be absolutely hell

I canceled this order and purchased the one for 1098.  Now should one get the newest controller with better tracking or not.  Is it worth the extra 200 bucks.  Not sure but for now I have the starter kit inrouter as I cancel this order maybe too soon…Should one exchange it for the newest?

The overriding problem with this product which made it impossible to like is that it broke very easily after only about 1 or 2 months of use. The headset that came with it is not sturdy and came off  to my dismay by just putting it on. There are very small plastic pieces that attach to the headset so if you're not extremely careful they will come off permanently. Once that happens HTC will require you to send it back and will tell you that you will be charged if they deem it necessary to fix, even after I sent them photo's clearly showing that the headset was not abused in any way. So be very careful because HTC may not support you without you paying for it.

Complicated set up but worked well for two weeks. Then a sensor stopped working. Contacted the manufacturer and sent the sensor back to be repaired. They would not send a new one because it had been too long. The received the unit on 2/16 and have not been able to fix or send a new one yet! One of the more difficult problems is that You can only communicate with HTC by chat. There is no contact number to call.  I will never buy any HTC product again

I'm writing this as someone who already had a totally modded up normal HTC Vive and then bought the Pro.  I tried all the games I am playing, Elite, Skrim also tried VR movies and the steam games like the Valve laboratory. The audio is great.  Google VR with comfort mode turned off it pretty damn awesome. The video/resolution is of course much better.  The new weight and headset balance is fantastic.  Cameras are awesome.  Snug fit, no light and very very comfortable.  I had the better headset and foam face pieces previously on my old non pro vive and this is still a huge improvement in every way. Rating it based on how much software is available or if you really don't like VR anyway seems a bit besides the point.  There is no better headset out there.  It is the best basically.  Yes have a good machine but have a good machine in general or get a different hobby. Don't like paying top dollar? Then don't buy top quality.

Ordered for my son. We spent 20 hours setting it up over and over on his Origin PC. It never worked. We received error messages and no HDMI messages. In my view....HTC has not worked out all the issues with connectivity. Out of the box brand new it should be simple to set up and run. If it doesn't work after three installs and troubleshooting, it's just not worth the time or money. Online comments from other sites have long stories about set up failure and error messages. We are pretty good at Tech set up and operation, but it never worked and we shipped it back.

Bought this in Dec 2017 and loved it until it broke in Jan 2018. Have chatted with support several times, exchanged emails with support several times. Cannot get an RMA to fix the headset, which constantly blacks out. All they do is have you go through the same useless steps every time you contact them. I’ve read that HTC is in financial trouble, so that may be why they won’t fix it. $600 down the drain!

Wish I could give 5 stars, but after sending in a support request a week ago and having no response(other than the automated email saying they got it of course) even after a follow up email I have to give this 1 star. This is the type of device I have wanted since I was a little kid and loved it while it was working, and now, less than three months after getting it the controller stops working correctly. This would have been no big deal had I gotten ANY communication from HTC, but it has now been a week with no attempt to resolve my problem or even get back to me in some fashion. How can they provide such bad customer support on a device that costs $800 each? The problem appears to be fixable on my own, but would void my warranty, but it seems like that is not worth much to HTC.So just a warning, understand that if something goes wrong, you are on your own as far as HTC is concerned...

I honestly cannot recommend this product. Though the video quality of the Vive is quite good, the customer service is the worst I've ever experienced. Within two days of receiving the product it broke, and we attempted to contact Vive support about the matter. Their rare correspondence was filled with propaganda advertising their new products almost never touched upon the issue at hand. Over the next month we managed to diagnose the problem ourselves and was due to rather poor product design that makes it extremely susceptible to water damage. Such damage was covered by their warranty, but their representative in customer service was unhelpful at best and seemed to ignore our replies.Fortunately, Amazon was so kind as to replace the broken device, but I would strongly recommend purchasing another VR set. While a pioneer of its day, other companies have since surpassed this technology for a better price.

The resolution seems better than Oculus somehow, I'm not sure how but it's clearer. In all other fields, the Oculus pulls ahead, with better controllers, better software, better compatibility, and better price. If you can ever manage to get the Vive to work with your computer, it won't be long before it doesn't again, and when it finally does, it will still give you issues.

The jury is still out for me. I recently purchased an iMac Pro and wanted VR. I read the reviews and decided this would work for an iMac. Well maybe. Vive is really designed to work with Windows, but there are work arounds for the Mac if the forums are to be believed. In short, the main HDMI to HDMI that comes with the kit needs to be replaced w/ an HDMI to USB C tether. I just ordered such a cable from Amazon, but have not tested the theory yet. My advice is to use caution when thinking of buying this for a Mac until developers make it solid. I am moving forward with it because it is the highest rated VR set and I want to see what is capable on the Mac Pro. It's a gamble.

My personal experience with this has not been great. The initial setup and installation was a total mess and took hours of troubleshooting just to get it working. It seems to work fine now, however. This is why it earns a 3 star review from me.Now... this is probably just my specific physiology, but I get super sick if I use this for more than 10 or so minutes. I can't really fault the VIVE for this part since this is probably specific to only a handful of people.But that initial install.... could have gone better.

It's pretty fun I guess. Unfortunately I've had to invest about 2 hours of troubleshooting, forum reading, driver deleting/reinstalling ect... for every hour of game play. The games are all mediocre at best. I mean there are a lot of experiences which are cool for maybe a half hour or so but that's about it. Honestly I would recommend waiting until they have a more polished product with less technical issues and more games.

I have mixed feelings about the HTC Vive that I think may apply to VR in general. Yes, it's amazing. Yes, it's mind-blowing. With the right game, absolutely terrifying (A Chair in a Room). It's so much fun to watch your friends play it from a distance.But then after 10 hours of so, you begin to notice the shortcomings of a technology still in its infancy. First, you notice the low resolution of the displays. Then, the teleport mechanic most games used to keep you from getting motion sickness becomes annoying. Then the subtle soreness of your neck muscles from holding that extra weight on the front side of your head. Then, if you play before you go to bed, you wake up feeling exhausted as if you didn't rest at all. There is some sort of mental excerption associated with using VR, at least for me and it's bad enough that it was interfering with my job so I don't use it after a couple hours before bed anymore. At some point you'll want to try the porn. Why not, it's out there. But it's just all so silly I found myself laughing at it.I don't regret my purchase at all. I got a kick from videogames I hadn't felt for years and some of the experiences make it totally worth it (Universe Sandbox for example). Plus, I'm supporting the platform so more R&D goes into it and the next generation addresses these issues.I recommend you buy it but don't expect The Lawnmower Man experience. Take it for what it is: a solid attempt at VR despite its many shortcomings.

I purchased this as an upgrade/replacement for my original Vive that broke slightly over the return time. I play Beat Saber quite frequently and sweat a lot (this is the nature of VR games). During a stream of regular use, the headset began to lose tracking to the point where I could no longer play the game. This was caused by the lax construction of this product. I have had this headset for 1 week.Pros: increased resolution is pretty nice, and the clearer lenses are also pretty nice.Cons: it will break. It's just a matter of time. It. WILL. break.Something of note is that the components of this headset, while indeed inside the headset and protected my the headset cover, the components are exposed inside the headset and prone to perspiration damage. Strangely enough, HTC has removed ""perspiration damage"" from the warranty as a seemingly blatant and shady acknowledgement of the flawed construction of this product. DO NOT buy this headset.

EDITING REVIEWA known defect in the controllers has gotten me now.  The right click button, or B button, stops working completely.  This is a known issue and many people have had it happen. I do not recommend buying this system until this issue is corrected.  The controllers are $130 each to replace.So glad I went with the HTC VIVE instead of the Oculus.  It is not only a fantastic experience, but you just can't beat Steam either.  I have played many games now and enjoyed it completely.  I have friends that were skeptics until they played, and now they want one.  One thing I didn't expect, you will sweat and work your butt off in some games...can be good exercise.  Looking forward to getting the wireless upgrade for the headset.Oh, and Fallout 4 coming soon to also.

In a short summary, the initial experience is great. That is until the slew of cables everywhere gets tangled up and you notice what some call the screen door effect. This effect is quite noticable even if you try to ignore it despite what some say. There is also a bit of tunnel vision but not nearly as bad as the phone versions (this blows phone vr away). The comfort level is surprising good. In the end, its a cool piece of tech with caveats that made me promptly return it. For the amount of money required even with the recent discount ill just go invest into Bitcoin. I recommend waiting for the next iterations of vr as I feel not only will they be cheaper, but these issues will hopefully be fixed.

The system itself is a lot of fun to use, and the catalog of games is vast and varied. Everyone in the family has enjoyed playing, as have our friends and visitors.HOWEVER. Their service and support leaves a lot to be desired.We bought the system in February. It started getting a little glitchy in April. On May 21, we stopped having any display in the headset. We contacted support. After a lengthy and confusing trouble-shooting session in which we had to disconnect and reconnect every cable between the headset, the wall, and the computer about 10 times, they agreed that the device was defective. They told me I had to ship it back to them for repair, and that the whole process would take 7-10 days, so we would have the device back in a week or so from when we shipped it.Their return for repair paperwork is heavy on the ""You must do exactly what we say or we'll charge you for the repairs and we won't necessarily send everything back to you in the condition it was received."" Given the quick repair turnaround, I accepted this and carefully removed all of the cords, straps, pads, etc from the headset. I shipped it at my expense, as required (which was aggravating). Tracking showed that it was received at their facility on 5/24. They didn't acknowledge receipt until 5/31. When I contacted them to ask what the holdup was, I was told that the items are ""queued to be scanned"" when they arrive, and ""this can take some time.""Also, this new person told me that the 7-10 day estimate is actually 7-10 BUSINESS days from when they scan the device as received.I have gotten no updates on the repair progress. Their ""repair tracking"" site basically tells you: a) when the ticket is opened; b) when the device is checked in; and c) when the device gets shipped back to you. So I have no idea what's going on with it or whether I'm ever getting it back.So basically, I'm feeling like I spent $800 to get an aggravating lesson in how badly a company can handle customer support and service. I am unlikely to buy anything from HTC in the future.

10/11/2017 Update:I have now owned my Vive for 1 1/2 years and while I do not play it as nearly as much as I would like to, it is truly an amazing experience and I love showing it to new people. If you are looking for a productivity VR headset for seated experiences, I suggest looking into Samsung's Odyssey or Pimax's 4/8K headset due to the higher pixel density.Few things to note since this time last year:* Price drops!* Way more games! Check out the /vive Reddit for suggestions, but there are some great ones out (check out Raw Data, Arizona Sunshine, Elite Dangerous, Onward, Doom 3 BFG Mod, to start with).* Valve has confirmed 3 original VR-made games; albeit, when and what are a mystery.* Valve has shown off new VR Controllers that are meant to mimic hand-like interaction* VR is growing with Microsoft Mixed Reality launching and general adoption growing. With this, prices have fallen.* There are other headsets on the market, but I am still a proponent for the Vive due to its upgrade-ability and overall approach to no-walled-gardens.* The Deluxe Audio Strap is a wonderful addition and adds comfort and integrated headphones to the Vive.* Outside of the Rift, do also look into Pimax's new headset (can utilize the Vive tracking and the resolution is higher) for gaming.* Fallout 4 VR is only 2 months away* The Rift now has touch controllers, roomscale, and is slightly cheaper; albeit, the walled garden still exists. I find the Rift's controllers to be slightly superior to the Vive's current controllers, but the tracking requires USB 3.0 connections for each camera and can be a bit messy.Full & Original Review Below:----------------------------------------------------------------------A wonderful VR experience and be sure to buy it directly from HTC's Vive website. Orders now ship within 2-3 days and you get the bundled games included (Tilt Brush/Fantastic Contraption/Job Simulator).BIG NOTE: Fallout 4 (the COMPLETE game) is coming to HTC Vive in 2017 :)Basically, the Vive is a first generation VR headset and while I love it I would only suggest it if you are fine with using a 1st generation headset. No, there aren't problems, but no it is not perfect. Mainly, it's expensive and you need a powerful computer to run it. While there is a large selection of games continually coming out, your options are still quite limited (people are still learning what to create after all). Game development is quite limited to indie developers due to the money AAA studios have to invest. With all this in mind, I love my Vive and I am happy with my purchase and if you would like more details about the Vive, I would checkout their website for explanation videos on Chaperone and what the HTC Vive itself is. In this review, I'm just going to enumerate some points about the Vive and why I prefer it over the Oculus Rift.A short summary of points:- $800 includes everything you need including touch controllers and tracking lighthouses that can be over 15 feet apart and are wireless (no USB hookup like Oculus)- The Vive is currently the only commercial headset supporting room scale VR.- The Vive is currently the only commercial headset offering manufacturer touch controllers.- The Vive is anti-exclusive, is completely open to developers, and functions solely on Steam (opposed to attempting to lock users in on the Oculus Home)- Re-Vive allows the Vive to play Oculus exclusive games.Why not Oculus?- They are attempting to buy exclusives through funding of developers (HTC/Valve is funding developers w/o promise of exclusivity). This matters due to the ecosystem and Oculus's ability to undermine a growing ecosystem.- It is owned by Facebook and its user agreement allows for complete data collection.- Touch controllers will not be arriving until at least November of 2016.- Room scale is being promised with the arrival of said touch controllers, but some individuals are skeptical.- Current gameplay consists of sitting in a chair with an Xbox controller. You will want to walk around in a VR world, it is the first thing you want to do.- The screen is nice; however, their business practices are appalling and is one of the main reasons I refuse to support them. I do not want to support a company who is actively working to undermine VR - a entirely new ecosystem - as a whole in order to lock developers to their platform (timely or not).- Even with the promises roomscale, two camera are needed, both needing a USB port (opposed to Vive's wireless lighthouses)- There is no word on the price of the touch controllers and new camera. $600 does not include anything needing for roomscale or touch.The Oculus itself is not a bad headset by any means (many reviews say the screen actually looks a little crisper), but it currently lacks in the roomscale which I find incredibly important to VR. This importance is hard to communicate and a quote I read yesterday sums it up quite nicely ""attempting to explain VR is like attempting to explain architecture by dancing."" Pair this with Oculus's attempting at exclusivity and their data collecting and I want to stay far away.NOTE: The claims below are no longer accurate. You are able to set up a separate account, but Oculus continues to ask for a wide variety of parameters (as do many other programs).Also, Oculus Runtime 1.8 requires you to be inter-connected with Facebook. Taken from their update word-for-word:""By opting to connect, you agree:Your Facebook friends will become your Oculus friends. As you add friends on Facebook and your friends connect to Oculus, your friend list here will be automatically updated.Your Facebook name will become your real name on Oculus.Even if your settings currently restrict your real name privacy, your Facebook friends who connect to Oculus will be able to see and search your real name.”

I would have rated it higher if I had actually been able to use the brand new Vive after receiving it today.  After a couple of hours trying to get it to work, I chatted with HTC Vive online for another couple of hours trying various things.  It turned out to be a defective Link Box (at least that's the story so far).  But are they going to send me a replacement while I send in the defective one?  No!  Now I have to wait for them to send me a package label, package it up and send it back to them.  Then when it arrives at their facility, I need to wait while they ""repair it.""  They are probably just going to toss it in the recycle bin, put a new one back in the mail and send it back to me (who knows when that will be).  Any bets that the one they send back will not be the original and have a completely different serial number (I wrote down the serial number of the defective one)?  It's not like I have a scam going to get free Link Boxes.  They and I have the full recorded conversation in which the tech that I chatted with came to the conclusion and stated that the Link Box was defective, so what more do they want?  After spending hundreds of dollars, this is how I am treated over a defective little $30 Link Box?  It is their defective product.  It is my disappointment, wait, time and hard work!

After trying it, I must say VR is pretty cool - I'm sure that in a few years I will probably try to buy it again, once the hardware is improved.Beyond experiencing VR in general, there were many things about the headset tat lead me to return it after a few days of useWhile I have not used the Oculus, it is even buggier from what I see on support forums.Pros:-VR!!!-Foam pads cover most of your face (small gap at nose bride, usually not noticeable)-Tracking and video much better than expected. Very few tracking issues or graphics related glitches/tearing-Little to no issues with base, never had to fiddle with them muchCons:-Lengthy setup... Mounting the base stations was more a pain than expected. The wall anchors did not work at all, ended up just using the screws in drywall which was not extremely secure while adjusting.  Lots of cables to connect, installation to do, and adjustment to get VR ready. Not to mention the PC specs needed to run VR.-BUGGY! So buggy... After setup, everything seemed to work great after tweaking. Then, when trying to play a game in the desktop theater mode, the VR headset suddenly crashed and wouldnt stop rebooting. Eventually was able to stop it from rebooting, but then the controllers would no longer work wirelessly. After doing a ton of troubleshooting, from what little support there is online, and a factory reset of everything, only 1 controller would pair at a time. Just one.Rebooting the headset or computer would cause the pairing to be lost from the one controller. Complete mess!-Blurry, resolution could be better. With a high power GTX 1080 capable of rendering 4K video, I expected the video in VR to look a bit sharper than what looks like SD or 720p. Text was extremely difficult to read in most situations, and things became more blurry the farther from the center of the screen you looked. Text near the outer edge is indecipherable. Note that this is after adjusting the prominent display knob on the bottom of the headset, as well as the not-so-obvious screen distance adjustment that you need to pop out the grey rings on the side of the headset to adjust. The only way I found this was from some forum online - there was no comprehensive manual in the box and the tutorial did not say anything about it.

Good when it works, but I've spent most of my time dealing with incompatibility issues, driver issues, etc.  I've worked with HTC support and all they do is blame the computer.  I spent $3k on a gaming computer that is more than capable of handling VR.  The headset is not functional, and cannot get any support.  I spent a significant amount of money for a product that provides little to no entertainment at this point.Be aware, you will likely have a lot of issues and receive no support from HTC.

The screen clarity IS marginally better, but not so much as to charge twice the price and not include the controllers or base stations. But the real reason for the lack of stars is that the vive pro would begin resetting itself after about 15 minutes of play. I'm assuming it's a heat management issue as the headset felt pretty warm in places when this happened. It always came back on after a few seconds, but the flash to black is SO disruptive in a VR environment that it makes the headset unusable. I wound up returning mine due to that issue. I have stayed immersed with the original vive for an hour or more without it overheating.

Let me start by saying that when this system works, it is pretty damn awesome. The experience is totally immersive, enough that it takes a minute or two to get your analog reality legs back. It does depend on the game/software you're using, of course. But we had a line out the door for neighbors and relatives wanting to try this thing on. Set up was medium difficulty for a techie oriented person, so if you call customer service when your cable goes out, get your brother-in-law in place before you try to set this system up. If things had stayed as they were when we received the item, I would have given 5 stars. Easy.But, the honeymoon ended too quick. One week after installing and running the system, the controllers began fouling up. One controller still pairs, but it no longer tracks with the system. Since the VR applications typically use two controllers, this is an issue. Meaning it renders the system unusual. But being forgiving, understanding nerds, we went through proper channels to get this fixed. After all, lemons happen. It took a week for the manufacturer to respond to multiple emails. Then, my husband spent 3 hours chatting with a rep (2 hours of which the rep was ""working with other customers ...red flag!),  Bottom line, we mail the system back at our expense, the manufacturer determines in an unspecified period of time if this is ""under warranty"" or not. If not under warranty, we pay for the repairs, return shipping and THEN they send back the system.This is a risky proposition for us, so why not take advantage of Amazon's return policy. I called Amazon customer service (making that happen is an adventure in itself), confirmed that exchanged items are new and not refurbished, etc. The system appeared to be working as it should. But it turns out Amazon does not exchange this item. Nope. You can get a refund (less shipping if you aren't a prime member), then you can purchase the item new from the website. Since we bought the system on sale, and the price has increased more than $100, we weren't to keen on this. No explanation was given for this, and we've never had this issue before. We have decided to risk sending the system back to the manufacturer for it to be fixed or replaced.Things to keep in mind:1) The usability and potential of this system is excellent, especially coupled with Steam. Get some help setting up before you do it, but that's not a biggie. I know that in 5 years we'll all be calling this ""rotary phone"", but for now, it's as close to sci-fi as medium income will get you.2) Apparently, you're on your own a bit. Do not purchase via Amazon if you are used to getting things fixed in person. THIS ITEM WILL NOT BE EXCHANGED. So if you buy it on sale and it's a dud, you'll be buying it at full price later.3) The current ""sale price"" is the average selling price on Amazon 30 days ago, and the normal sale price everywhere else. Just saying. Since you're not protected as per usual via Amazon, this is a case where ""dynamic pricing"" screws consumers.4) Our weak link was the controllers. Be diligent in the first few weeks you're using the system. Document failures and be skeptical. It goes from ""awesome but twingy"" to ""unusable"" in 4-5 seconds.I will update this after we see what happens with the manufacturer.

This is a really amazing VR system, but these controllers appear to be poorly made.  Twice the hand-held controllers have stopped working after just a few weeks.  They were not dropped or mistreated in any way.I have now had these controllers fail three times so far.  The first time was not long after I purchased the system so I returned it for a refund and re-purchased a system.  The controller broke several times thereafter, but the repair is not for the faint of heart and it will void your warranty.  There are YouTube videos showing how to fix the controllers.  There is a design flaw with the thumb-pad.  It uses a tiny rubber cushion to pivot on, and repeated pressing of the thumbpad will cause this rubber piece to move out of position. When it does, the controller will stop working.  It is a very scary, precise job that needs to be done to repair the controllers -- and it's just temporary because sooner or later they will break again.  I think HTC should send all existing users a set of the new knuckle controllers when they're available, because these have problems that make them troublesome.  You may not notice the problems right away -- it depends upon how much use the controllers get, but if you play games like Gorn or Drunken Bar Fight or some of the first person shooters that get your adrenaline going, pressing hard on the thumb pad happens a lot more often and it's easy to break them right away.

Will not load. After almost 3 hours, these systems will not load.  I bought 2 of these for Christmas presents and neither set will load.  2 different computers, completely compatible computers, but systems will not load on either.  Constant error message 212, message about being mirrored, etc.  Will probably send back and find a different brand.Update!  After about 10 to 12 hours of reconfiguring, updating aspects of their laptops that aren't usually updated, such as the non primary driver, the VR headsets are FINALLY working.  These headsets were packed up repeatedly to be returned, but my adult sons kept trying.  These are NOT in any way, shape or form plug and play.  You must be adept at updating drivers on your computer, such as the Intel driver.  These will only work if you have the appropriate processor capabilities.  HUGE hassle to make these work, but after many hours of trying to figure out how to make them work, my sons are enjoying them.  Be warned!!  There are NO instructions as to how to set these headsets up, lots of research online was required.

It took me several days to write this review as I waited for the Micro Display port to Micro Display port adapter that I needed for my laptop.  I started off a bit irked about dropping the HDMI support, but I can't so much hold that against the company seeing as I should have read the specs a bit more carefully.  First and foremost though, this does provide fantastic clarity through the HMD.  I had reduced the overlay super sampling on my Steam Dashboard to 0.7 in order to allow me to raise some super sampling on other games.  The trade off on the original Vive was fuzzy screen quality when selecting my games, which wasn't a big deal.  When I (finally) got the Vive Pro up and running, I thought my settings had reverted as it was as clear as the unaltered super sampling, if not more so!  So...if your only concern is image quality and you will handle everything else, there you go.  As for the downsides, there are several.  The headphones are junk, they pop and crackle like a set of $20 wal-mart bargain binners, they are mounted to the headset in such a way that you can't get them -just right- on your ears, and where they are it actually hinders putting on a good set.  On the bright side, they are so flimsy I can just break them off.  As for the rest of the headset...HTC, how did you screw this up?  The overall pressure equalization is great!  However, the screw that ratchets down the rear part of the head band is trash...you can't get it particularly tight as it simply slides free.  The extra padding on the rear was a good idea, but the thickness of it causes extreme sweating.  I was able to spend hours in the original vive and barely steam the mask, in just a half hour in this even on non-strenuous games I am having to hop out and wipe my forehead to keep from soaking the lenses.  The field of vision was great on the original Vive, even if the god rays from those lenses were annoying.  However, the silly little nose piece on this one actually blocks my view, leaving a solid little bar right between my eyes.  Oh and a final note...the head phones, good luck with those.  They simply stopped working even though my computer saw them and showed it was pushing sound to them.  Turn off the link box, turn it back on, headphones work, start Steam, headphones stop.  I finally found out that turning the link box off after starting steam, then turning it back on made them work until I restarted Steam.  Seriously HTC, you are charging 800 dollars for this and I will have to spend another 200 at least to make it a decent product.  You all should be ashamed of yourselves, everyone that is wanting to buy this thing, don't.  Buy the original headset, it is far superior in everything except the display and costs almost half the price.  If you are dead set on getting it for the wireless capability in the future, just have some hardware experience or wait for the posters to start putting up instructions on how to fix this piece of junk.

After initially reviewing the specs between the various VR systems, the Vive seemed the best on paper, so I bought one in June.Less than two months after purchase.. after little use.. one of the base stations developed an unrecoverable hardware fault and needed repair.I realized I was not alone, and a lot of people have seen base station hardware faults.. this itself is extremely disappointing and speaks to the build quality of this system.  Worse.. after sending it off for repair, a month ago.. it is still sitting as 'device received' and the warranty repair is happening at a glacial pace. The base station has spent almost as much time in the repair facility as in my front room!!  and still no clear news when I will get a working unit back :(  I chose the Vive based on the ostensible superiority over the Rift in room-scale, and tracking.. but if it does have an advantage there, it probably is not enough to justify purchase over the Rift, given the poor reliability of the Vive, and awful customer service/tech support.  I'm a developer and in fairness I planned to get the Rift at some point anyway, but I was going to focus my VR efforts on the Vive. Now? I'm going to concentrate on the Rift.. As for the Vive, I'm going to hold off on that for now, as it is too unreliable, and the customer support is downright scary.. As I write this, I don't even know when I am going to get a working base station back.. and even if I do, I'm not holding my breath on how long the unit will last until it needs another 'repair' :(

There's a widespread issue with the lighthouses being broken out of the box: [...]Used HTC webchat support, they recognized my issue after I sent them two pictures plus text logs of the lighthouse failing but were unable to do anything since I bought it through Amazon. Called Amazon, who wanted me to box up and send the thing back to get a replacement - this is absurd considering there are approximately 50 parts that all come in little sealed sachets with adhesive protectors for their fragile lenses and I have already drilled the wall anchors into my walls.  I ended up getting a $135 credit to my card to pay for ordering a replacement lighthouse from HTC, though they're out of stock and that won't cover shipping. All told my support experience took over an hour, to say nothing of the hours of frustration attempting to set it up - the instruction manual doesn't even acknowledge the possibility of a lighthouse having a red error light and everything is completely dysfunctional on older graphics cards (just trying to update the firmware on the parts to see if that would fix it).

I'm so sad with product. I was so excited when I ordered and never thought I would ever return it. I dig the hole in my drywall for the controllers as soon as they arrived. However, it just ends up ruining my wall after I return it.It is not as good as advertised, and I have no idea where does those good reviews come from.First of all, you can see the pixels while wearing it. I could even see it without wearing my glasses. It doesn't feel like reality when you see that many big pixels.Secondly, you can easily feel dizzy when you wear it just for a little bit of time, even if you are just playing small games. It makes me sick after wearing it for just a little bit of time. It also make my eyes very uncomfortable afterwards. I can easily feel it's not good for my eyes since.If you ever tried Samsung VR headset, you would be very disappointed with this one cuz how could it not have focus adjustment with this high price! I have to wear glasses to see things clearly, but it's uncomfortable and even more heavy to wear the headset while moving.What's even bad, the software to support is not that good either. Not to say I installed it from 5pm-12am that night, it's even hard for me to play game s after it is installed. From time to time, the application doesn't run. Sometimes the computer screen displays fine but the headset screen displayed red things. Sometimes it says unknown error happens which shouldn't have happen. With some games, two eyes in the headset display the views from different directions which makes you unable to play the game. You would thing riding a roller coster or a train in VR would be cool right? They do nothing but just makes me sick. I spend a whole afternoon on the weekend just to make Google earth running.It's not that exciting even though you can play it in room scale. In the game, you couldn't play it by just walking. The space is limited and you have to use the controller to jump to move in the game. Room scale functionality doesn't make any difference.Maybe I was so disappointed because my expectation was hight since I tried both PS4 VR and Samsung VR in BestBuy, and this one is supposed to be better than both of them, but I dob't think that's the truth.

The headset failed twice a few months after purchase and had to be returned for repair both times. Instead of coverage under warranty they required $270 for repair on two separate occasions. Both times the failure mode was stated as 'liquid damage"". I mentioned that I perspired while playing room scale games and they took it as justification for requiring payment. After the repair I wore a headband and frequently wiped away perspiration.  After sending in the unit a second time and having been given the same failure mode with another $270 repair cost I refused to go along with the deal. I talked with their RMA department several times which came up with all kinds of excuses and wacky failure causes. They kept my unit for several weeks - probably believing I would relent - but when that didn't happen they returned it without repair.Since then I purchased an Oculus Rift and have had very good success with their product. I bought the Rift controllers and extra sensor. Vive required frequent, numerous troubleshooting techniques to keep the system running.  Rift, by comparison, is trouble-free. However, with two smaller sensors placed less distance apart it doesn't really have the room scale play that Vive has. Some games configured for Rift as well as Vive pose coverage problems for Rift - the scope of play has to be altered somewhat. Yet the games have better clarity in Rift - and the headset is much lighter - making it 'cooler' for extended playing. I think the Rift controllers are better as they track your finger placement on multiple button controls - which is lacking with Vive. Also, each controller has a toggle-joystick/switch that feels natural and really comes in handy. You can extend your index figure and manipulate game elements - quite an enhancement.My focus is on 3D VR flight simulations, such as the DCS applications, which are unaffected by the Rift reduced scale play area. Interestingly, Steam and SteamVR, (with headset and controller tracking), work with Oculus Rift. So you can keep your Steam (formerly Vive account) and use the games you bought for Vive on the Rift! And you can keep buying games from Steam if that is desired.I hope this review is helpful if you are planning to purchase either HTC Vive or Oculus Rift.

I'm sure it's a good system but unfortunately it required additional computer support. Our computer was too old to support it and we didn't want to spend an additional $800 to 1,000 in order to use the system so we returned it. But from looking at over it looks pretty cool. So when you buy this make sure you have a newer computer or are prepared to buy one in order to make it work/use it.

The customer support from HTC Vive and Steam is totally useless.  If you buy this know that your on your own.  I have just built a new PC with 2 ASUS GTX 1080 Ti FE's in SLI, I9 7900x CPU, ASUS Prime 299X MB, 64GB RAM, all drivers and bios up to date and the Vive will not run on it.  The Vive runs fine on my old PC with a AMD 8350 CPU and a GTX 1080 Ti.  Clearly HTC and Steam forgot to call the intel developers group in Folsom and ask for some help coding an update for the new Skylake series CPU's.  My support tickets to both HTC and Steam are still unanswered after a week.  Not even a ""give us a bit"" to check into my issue.  To me this means they are lost, otherwise they should just tell me when they will have an update or they are working on it.  In all the blogs I have mentioned this problem, no one has responded that they are running an i9. So if your into the latest and greatest, you'll have to wait on this one.

This is my first low rating on Amazon.  I was super excited about this upgrade from the HTC Vive to the Vive Pro.  A lot of reviews stated that it was an nice improvement but not earth-shaking.  I decided to go for it the day before they were planning to start shipping them.  I ordered through Amazon on 4 Apr.  I got an email stating that the delivery date would be between 1 May to 16 May, so I decided to be patient and not worry about it.  In a few days, I got an update that moved the delivery date to 18 Apr!  I then started to get excited because it was almost a month early.  I got another update that said it would be delivered on Sunday, 15 Apr and would be there before 8:00 PM!  I was now really looking forward to trying out the new headset and replacing my older one.  As you can see, the buildup and anticipation had me looking forward to its early delivery.  It showed up around 1:00 on Sunday and I had nothing else to do that day but to get this new VR headset working and I was jazzed!  Amazon exceeded my expectations in every way up until the point where I started opening the package.  I could tell that something was not quite right but I remained optimistic.  It was packaged as a box within a box within a box.  Still everything was ok but I noticed that it looked like it had been repackaged, almost as if someone else already had it and sent it back.  There was scotch tape holding the USB and DisplayPort cables together and other small details that looked like it may not be brand new.  There were also no detailed instructions but I figured those could be referenced on-line.  I loaded updated video card drivers and hooked up the link box and headset.  My system would not recognize the headset and I had Error 208.  I researched everything I could and did everything the forums said to do to troubleshoot the error to no avail.  I then started a chat session with HTC support.  The girl was very friendly and ran me through a gambit of diagnostics.  She finally determined that the headset was defective and said that I would have to return it through Amazon since that is where I purchased it.  I was super bummed because there is a 1 to 2 month wait for this item and now I would have to start the process all over again.  I had to repackage it and go through the return process with Amazon.  I am not sure I want to re-order it because of this unfortunate experience.  I would warn anyone ordering this item to hold off until they work out the issues.  I am a deeply disappointed customer due to the fact that I got a defective unit and that there was no way to get a replacement in a reasonable amount of time.  Thanks for reading and I hope you don't suffer a similar fate.

I regret buying this. I knew it was a bad idea from other stuff i have seen but fallout 4 in vr sounded so awesome but it is too good to be true. I got the headset and the quality is absolutely terrible. You can count all the pixels on the screen if you wanted to because they are very noticeable when playing a game. I tried fallout 4 vr and it is so blurry that it was unplayable for me and after a bunch of research i turned off taa, fxaa and increased super sampling and render target multiplier stuff and i got rid of the bluriness but it just caused an unbearable amount of flickering like grass and such and so nothing worked and i downloaded steamvr advanced settings to try to fix it and it didnt help either so i was like maybe it is just fallout so i tried other games and they have terrible quality as well. I dont have flickering or as much bluriness issues but the quality is still really bad but i bought this vr headset just to play fallout 4 and i am very disappointed with it. I dont think i have a defective unit, i think that is how it looks but it looks aweful to me. The quality is just so bad and i regret this purchase.

Great when it works, but when it doesn't you are on your own.  Mine worked for a day and a half fine then suddenly stopped.  I have spent the last week in a failed attempt to find out why.  If you contact HTC the tell you to go to the Steam forums, in the steam fourms you can find as many different opinions as you want all conflicting with each other, take your pick.  I sent a message to steam with a system capture, but received no response.  I guess I'll cut my losses and sent it back to Amazon before my 30 days run out.

While VR is a fascinating ""new"" technology, the HTC VIVE feels like the Wii of last-gen consoles. It's fun exploring gaming in a new way, but VR is just not there for me yet.Here are some of the cons I ran into:-My eyes are near perfect vision. My prescription for glasses is only .25. That's less than most reading glasses you'll find. However, I'm far-sighted, and in that regard, it's painful to have a screen close to my face because I feel like I have to cross my eyes to see most of the HUDs in games.-Low ceilings and ceiling fans are very troublesome in games where you have to put your hands above you for anything. I'm 6' 3"" and my ceilings are only 8'. Add in a ceiling fan that comes down 14"" and you're in for a bad time. Especially if it's on.-Calibration would sometimes get very awkward. The headset has a pupillary distance adjustment knob on the side of it, and that's great, but I honestly feel like I couldn't get it close enough. My particular unit could only go to 60.8, where I believe the minimum it claims is 60.0. I may be splitting hairs at this point, but that's not how it was addressed in the manual as far as I could see.-Motion sickness. Sure, you have to expect a little bit of ""getting used to it"", but if your computer is on the lower end of the spectrum and a game starts chopping - prepare to puke. Try to imagine looking around a room with your eyes at 10FPS and being otherwise deprived of your senses aside from touch and smell, and then being startled by something. I couldn't get this headset off fast enough.-Graphics feel like they're from the mid-2000's. TF2 and Half-Life 2 and the like would probably look fine on VR systems, but if you're wanting realistic graphics, I didn't find any.TL;DR: I want to like it, but the technology is just not there yet.-If you have any FPS drops you're going to get sick.-If you're far-sighted, you're going to have a bad time if you don't wear glasses.-VR Games can't push graphics that impress.-If you're tall, be wary of ceiling fans.

Stopped working after 10 uses.  Required software updates with every use to work and when it did work performance was sketchy at best.  Probably was dropped one too many times by previous owner or in shipping.  30 day return policy is scarcely adequate on such a sensitive piece of electronics.  Learned an important lesson:  Never buy something with so many tiny pieces of sensitive electronics used, EVER.

Horrible resolution. Text in steam vr  seemed so blurry and barely readable. Found myself actually trying to squint at image inches from my face. When looking at the recently opened items from the steam home room, I hover the controller pointer over ""3D Viewer"" and the text looks horribly blurred and out of focus. Tried adjusting the headset but this just made this from bad to worse.Tried supersampling with no effect. It's a pain to connect the controllers as they always need some kind of troubleshooting.

I've owned the headset for around two weeks and will be returning it. If you purchase this be prepared to pay top dollar for tech demos that aren't even fun. Visually it looks a bit worse than the Gear VR using an S7 Edge. Tracking is amazing. Wait a few years for a higher resolution and a library of real games-if they ever come.

First and foremost there is no telephone support--maybe that is a good thing because their English language articulation is inferior to their written language skills.You can only text technical support. That is after successful navigating a labrinith of website links.Then they are texting with three other people at the same time as you.So after they read through the same script that they use for everyone--regardless of all the specific knowledge you have of your particular situation --an hour later you will come to a brick wall.Then when you ask them to remote in with TeamViewer , they will tell you --as they did me--that ""We don't have enough techs to remote in now, you will have to wait until after 3:00 pm.""After you have ground down all your teeth and have had numerous root canals --many hours later the bugs in their software can be worked out.I had updated the base stations, the headset and the controllers to the latest firmware, my video card to the latest driver and their software to the latest version and still they will have you go through the same list of redundant bug fixes again.This device when it works is wonderful--but good luck getting it to work or keeping it working.Their software is full of bugs and you are alpha testing (not beta)--it is as if no one at the company has ever tested it.I would --before buying it--see if there is phone support for the Oculus Rift--if so call the number and see how long it takes to get through.Otherwise be prepaired for hours of frustration --this NEVER ends--I was up and running with numerous games and then nothing --headset no images, or controllers not tracking, or base not able to see controllers, etc etc. it's not as if you fix the bugs and your off and running for months.It's possible they don't keep up with windows updates. Regardless they dedicate no resources to their staff--just don't call before 3:00.

I've tried two computers and roughly 6 hours later and the headset still refuses to be detected. As much as I love HTC and Valve the amount of garbage this thing seems to rely on to install really seems to be hampering the troubleshooting process. I have no idea how to uninstall the drivers as manually removing them from control panel (anything marked ""Vive"") or the device manager (if you manage to actually find it). I've tried everything on user forums short of contacting HTC which I already know will be entirely pointless. Don't buy it. Take the 800 bucks and got get something else.

...the additions to this HMD over the original Vive do not come even close to warranting the incredibly horrid price hike.I have extensively tested this device (friend got it for work) but do not own one.If we cast aside what they are charging for this (the HMD only is $800; keep that figure in mind later on), the Vive Pro is the best VR HMD I have used full stop.The image quality (taking into account the sharpness of the picture, the brightness, the FOV relative to screen resolution, ext) is equal to the Samsung Odyssey. The HMD also makes use of the SteamVR basestations which provide the most accurate tracking method available In my opinion, this is the most important thing regarding VR; tracking. Because of this, I believe this is what pushes this device past the Samsung Odyssey.The issues with the Vive Pro are:- Ergonomics. I know for a fact that HTC listened to enterprise feedback regarding what to change for the Pro versus the original Vive. Easier to put on, more short term comfort, ext. It shows in the final product. While it is very comfortable at first, I found that after about an hour it started to really show its fangs. The device is very front heavy. I tried adjusting the top strap multiple times (like with the original Vive utilizing the deluxe audio strap) but was not able to get it to be as comfortable as the Vive with the deluxe audio strap.If you plan on using the Pro for long periods of time, you might find it to be a little too uncomfortable.- Sound. It might have just been the unit I was using but the audio sounds really bad. There has been a hotfix for this (steamVR hotfix) but my friend who owns the unit says the fix has not helped very much.- Proprietary cable. The cable coming from the Pro HMD to the link box is proprietary. If you damage it, you HAVE to get a new one from HTC. This is the same company that has been charging an arm and a leg for ANY a la carte item for the Vive ecosystem.The BIGGEST con for the Vive Pro in general is the cost-to-quality ratio. The Vive Pro by itself (HMD only package) is $800. That is $300 more than the Samsung Odyssey which has the same screens AND comes with its own controllers (granted worse tracked ones but regardless it comes as a full package). The Vive Pro full package (with basestations and controllers) is $1400. I personally do not believe that the Pro is worth this price point. I have more than enough funds to warrant purchasing this device but I cannot fathom the idea of supporting what HTC is doing here.In my opinion, you are much better off buying the original Vive (full package) for $500, then additionally buying a Samsung Odyssey for $500 so that you pay $400 less for the same experience. You CAN utilize Windows MR HMDs with Vive controllers and trackers. The controllers and trackers will utilize the basestation and the controllers will communicate back to the Vive. You simply unplug the HDMI plug from the Vive (so that it is only transferring controller data) and follow the steps within this video to get the Windows MR HMDs to work with the other devices.I will post helpful links on this subject in the comment's section of this review.It is ridiculous to even notion getting this device. Is it the best assembly of parts for VR at this current moment? Yes, yes it is. However you will be paying an arm, leg, and kidney for it. If you have so much material wealth that you don't really value money, get this device. If you are looking for the best value on the market, get an original Vive with the deluxe audio strap. If you want the best experience for less than the Vive Pro, go the Vive controller and basestation route with the Samsung Odyssey.

It was quite amazing for about an hour after the 30 mins or so it takes to set up. The problem happened on day 2. I went to power it on and 1 of the 2 base stations wouldn't turn on. Followed troubleshooting from HTC and they deemed it defective and since it is only a couple days old it would be easier to get a replacement from Amazon. However Amazon support for some reason will not send me a replacement. Only a return. It appears to be ""in stock"" and while I understand that I can wait a week for the refund and then process another order, I have already purchased games for this $800 paper-weight. While a 1 star may not be in order in this case, at the moment the unit is unusable on day 2 and getting a replacement isn't as easy as it should be.

I've been in contact via email with HTC and have attempted many troubleshooting options, to no avail. It only works for a few minutes till the blue gray screen returns.

The headset is very heavy and you have to strap it on very tight to keep in in place, which after  a little while will make my head hurt. In other words, this product can't be used for long periods of time.Also the controller pairing is very glichy. More then half the time the controllers will not sync with the system, causes me to have to reset them and keep trying until they finally do. Also the battery life on these controllers are horrible, they die out so quick it's ridiculous.Oh and I hate the amount of room this thing takes up. I have to move my bed and everything to use it, It needs a whole room of its own to use properly.I'm going to buy the occulus rift to try and compare the two to see which one is better the comfort department.Other then that Virtual Reality is AWESOME!

Having hard time which one to get?  Vive or Oculus??Graphics and Sound: I have both the Oculus and the Vive. To be equally fair to the system, I have to test Allumette on both platforms and Oculus is definitely the choice mainly due to its graphics, animation, frames per seconds and sound. I spent a lot of money on my PC with NVidia 1080 and Intel 7-6700 K to have great graphics and the Oculus utilized these powers really well.  With the Vibe, the graphics becomes choppy as you look around your environment.  With Oculus, there is no choppiness and the animation is flawless specially the moving mechanical parts of the boat.  One thing to notice is the lens of the Vive is ridges around the lens like onions.  These ridges are easily reflected on the screen while behind the white clouds due to white contrast but none of these are visible on the Oculus as it lens are clear and no ridges.  The sound is really great with the integrated headphone on the Oculus.  The clear winner is the Oculus, by 3 pointsInteractive:  Right now, the Vive comes with 2 remote controller that let you grab things.  The winners here are to be decided when Oculus Touch comes on December 6.  To be fair let’s give the Vive 2 points here.Immersion:  Both system are 3D and realistic but the deciding factors here is again how good the graphics are, animations and frames per seconds.  The Vive is choppy with its animation and the graphics is pixilated especially if you walk further away from the subject.  The 3d graphic quality of the Oculus is definitely superior as well as the smooth animation when you do a quick turnaround to look around your environment while playing Allumette.  I think this is called the refresh rate.  Just try getting inside the boat and look at the movement of the boat and you will see what I mean.  Both games are available for free download.  2 Points goes to OculusComfort:  The clear winner is the Oculus!!!!  When I first got the Vive, it was heavier, with 3 heavy wire and additional wire from the headphone.  It has thick and wider foam around the unit which makes it hotter and sweaty to use on your face.  If you have the Vive, don’t place it on top of the table as it will surely fell of the table as the heavy wire will drag it down unless it’s secured.  The Oculus definitely wins here by 1 point.Setup:  The technology that the Vive used was the Laser System on the base station to scale your room and track your movement versus camera used by Oculus that are easily place on your desktop.  Since the Vive uses a laser, you can loose the tracking you need to have that sync cable to be connected, that means more wire!!  The winner here is Oculus.  1 pointGame Content:  People will choose Vive because of Steam and SDK open development while Oculus is well organized in its own Oculus store.  Right now there are games that both systems have games supported that are available at Steam.  The games that stands out right now is Chronos with Oculus and not available with the Vive.  This is an amazing games with very good graphics and animation.  Anyhow, game content is a tie.The choice for me is an easy one which is the Oculus who won in the category by 10 of 10 while the Vive had 2 out of 10.Graphics and Sounds worth 3 pointsImmersion is worth 2 pointInteractive is worth2  pointSetup is 1 point

This has got to be the most un-user friendly product on the market.

Just...why. I mean, i REALLY want to rate this five stars since it is fun once you get it running. But the utter pain just to get it up and running, and then the constant fiddling you have to do to get it running consistently is just bogus for the amount of cash you drop on this.

First of all,  I did all the research as I always do to find the best deal for the money spent. I still feel (if a higher percentage of product worked),that the HTC Vive is the best of the top three for versatility. That being said,lets tell some truth. Fact: If you look you will find a LOT of people having problems with the quality of the cables,and the functionality of the headset. The box was packaged very well by Amazon and HTC. Essentially it comes in three boxes each inside the other. Packaging score 10. Definitive and easy to navigate instructions.......score 2. As soon as you open the box it has a large piece of paper that tells you only one thing go to www (etc.) You must now wait for the download of the drivers and software...... there is no easy to load disc......score 1. Next your computer loads the drivers and software for Vive,which is step one of two. Part 2 is the download of Steam client and software for Steam VR. I have had Steam for 10 years,and had already prepared for the Vive,so I had the SteamVR installed and ready,but had not used it of course. Well the loader program acknowledged that I had steam,as shown on the screen as ""STEAM found"". So we skip that step right,or it recognizes I have all that right?...Nope....it tried to load it all again and failed!! Five times folks I had to start all over from the beginning cause they have no other options . You have no option to proceed once the Vive setup software is done,even if you have steam,it will try to install it again. Failure,failure,failure. I had to uninstall my Steam with all the VR games I had spent hours getting ready to play. Score 0. After uninstalling Steam client and starting all over again,it finally installed and went to the next screen.Its the ONLY way to progress,no other options. Keep in mind this has taken over an hour so far,just to load the software. The big piece of paper placed to the side,I now gently unpack all the little bags of items,and lay them out on the table. Once I placed the base units on book shelves,(which are solid and don't move obviously,I say this for clarification coming up soon), I connected the base units to power,and they synced immediately with the b and c letters no problem. Score 10. Hookup the graphics card to the link box from the PC,easy and effortless.Take out the headset,gently place it on the couch cushion and remove a piece of white cardboard from the optic lenses. There was NO protective film to remove from the lenses as stated... Score -1. Removed the film from the from headset camera, and hooked up the headset to the link box. Effortless score 10. Boom!! Red light on the side of the headset. Now bear in mind folks,they give you this big sheet of paper which is uselss other than telling you whats in the box and where your software is to go get. Then you have 3 white little manuals. One to measure your pupils distance from each other,one to tell you of a limited warranty, and one for safety and FCC regulations. Keep looking dig deep,nope there is NO USER MANUAL for troubleshooting,things to try before calling etc.,nothing folks. There is NO printed guide in this box.So how are you the consumer suppose to know which button does what,or what lights are ok and what color are they suppose to be. Nothing!. I knew that Steamvr had to load to ""run"" my unit, but it wouldn't load. Ok,now by this time,standing in front of eight hundred dollars of spent money,I was getting angry. Base stations green,all wires connected, (their wires and cables,not mine),and a headset which doesn't display. Can I troubleshoot from my documents...nope there are no documents remember.Ok so now its time for customer service. I always chat so I can have a printed record of the conversation. Kim answered the chat. Very nice person off the bat. I explain the above and it starts to feel like she is only reading bits and selected words from my chat,so she can stay ahead with her responses.How do I know,her response would hit my desktop before I finished typing my sentence. That's ok,Tier 1 customer service is basically people with the essentials to help with simple problems,that can be looked up quickly based on basic complaints,so the real tech wizards can field the ""difficult"" calls. Kim did a great job of trying but,she finally had to use ""logmein"" (its software that allows a remote ""takeover"" of your computer). So I sat and watched (and recorded), everything she did within my computer. Most is standard stuff as in Directx diagnosis,reinstalling drivers,reinstalling setup, checking cable connections etc. After another hour she finally got the display to come on,which took a FIRMWARE update from Vive. (Another permanent tweak to the headset itself.) So not a consumer fault. Score 10 for Kim and 5 for Vive. Hey great almost 3 hours and the headset is on. Wait,"" whats this shaking of the graphics,is that normal I asked?"" No Kim stated it should not shake. She leaves,comes back and says,someone said to MOUNT my hardware,and that would probably stop the shake.Will you mount the bases now?"" I replied "" No Kim, I am not able to mount these right now.( Remember I had just opened the box and started having trouble,much less got any tools out to do anything.) They are STABLE and stationary. (As stated sitting flat on bookshelves,tilted 30 degrees via thin book on rear of base. ) She said that's ok if I didn't want to do it right now,but maybe later.)?? She then pushed past this issue and said lets see if we can get the controllers working. I am not the expert,so I said ok I'll get them. Got the two controllers. She says turn them on and point....( I started to type) wait what button turns them on? There are a lot of buttons here,and none are marked with words,just weird symbols,so whats on and off."" She said hit the buttons they show on the computer screen."" Ok I see a button with a three lines and a button with ""stacking"" paper (no clue why these symbols ,or what they mean ,or how the consumer will relate, other than their remembered position on the handle,but ok I press) Score 3. Nothing! Score 0. ""Did you press the buttons?"" Yes I said I pressed them several times!!! she says "" OK great, what color is the LED?""  I said  ""What LED? ""The one on the handle of the controller,what color is it flashing?"" Nothing I said,its dead. (very calmly) she says ok,lets get the USB charger cables out and hook them up to the usb charge. ""  ""I thought they were charged out of the box per the TV add??"" (she didn't respond to that). So if they were charged and checked by QA,then why are they DOA at the consumers house?? still calm Kim says "" Its ok, lets see if they will pair. Well folks the cables provided to charge are approximately two feet long or so give or take,so your not doing anything that takes much moving. We finally got them to pair. Great she says. Kim score 7 ,Vive 0, for poor QA. But hang on remember that blur or vibration,we haven't fixed that yet. I had been on the phone for four hours folks...FOUR HOURS on a NEW  $800.00 product out of the box,and it still did not perform as advertised. Today I HAVE to call again, give them the ticket number and start this again. I hear getting an RMA is the most difficult thing in the world from HTC. I bought mine from AMAZON and I know they honor there sales. Might give you a clue as to how you make a purchase if you do buy this.  But HTC .....I'll be back for side 2 of this debacle.

So don't let the stars fool you, this is an awesome system, i'm just posting it as a 1 star review to bring awareness to an issue i encountered so hopefully no one else has to go through it. If you want to skip to the end, i have a PSA warning down there as a summary.The system itself i would give 4 stars. The controllers have issues connecting wirelessly occasionally but it's easy enough to remedy by plugging the controller into the USB port. It also doesn't happen all that often, so as long as the firmware is up to date, you shouldn't have this issue much. The image is clear and the motion tracking works pretty well.Onto the issue at hand. I bought this headset from a chain retail store (not Amazon). Within the first week one of the controllers had an issue. The trackpad part of the controller got stuck on the right side and would no longer recognize push feedback. Doesn't make the controller unusable, just takes away some functionality depending on the game you're playing. I emailed support and they got back right away. They told me to send serial numbers to them to get the repair under way. You do have to pay for shipping to their repair center but i was okay with that because it's a fraction of the cost of buying a new one, plus they pay return shipping, so it's only fair.The issue came in the second email. Apparently my system was branded for Taiwan, and therefore was not valid in the US. Even though i bought it from a US retail store, in the US, that didn't seem to matter. It was branded for Taiwan, end of story. I needed to contact the Taiwan support team and ship it there for repair. So, two issues:1. I don't speak Taiwanese, while i'm sure there are some English speakers in their support team, i would have to assume contact will be a little difficult at first (really not the major issue here).2. this is the big one, i would have to pay for shipping to Taiwan to get my controller fixed.So, due to a shipping error on HTC's end (i'm assuming) I'm now responsible to get my controller fixed, that was  essentially defective out of the box, in Taiwan. There was no resolution, just sorry but you bought the wrong item.So, just as a PSA for all of you looking to buy this, if you get it and it says Taiwan, anywhere on the box. Demand a new unit immediately, do not open it and ship it back to your seller. Because if you keep it and you have an issue within the first 12 months, you are out of luck, unless you want to pay to ship it to Taiwan.

The device just arrived today, this review is from a Vive, Oculus, Odyssey user.The packaging it's pretty barebone for its price, I'm not talking about what it is inside but about how everything is packed, probably thats why I received mine with a scratch in the front... First impressions are so and so, when you get the most expensive headset on the market you expect the perfection, it's legit, but it's not the case, the fitting is very very good, the screen resolution imprevement is very very welcome, but the God Rays are very very noticeable. Color and black in the odyssey are better, but amazing screen anyway (probably just a different calibration)Audio I think it has some problem, it totally lack of bass, I tried to reinstall everything, but it's just very weird, will try again with more time, but the included audio and the 360 audio are very very welcome!!Btw I did a video about it, you can check out at YouTube .com/c/Tyrielwood  I don't think I can share the link here. It's my last video so you will be find it no problem.For this price hard to suggest, I will update my review in the future but for now.. it's a no

My son was so excited to finally get his vice. We worked hard to get it all set up. Then one of the controllers wouldn't track. We had to try quite a few different things to finally get it to work. Then fiddling with the headset we were frustrated once more with not being able to adjust it so that it wasn't blurry. Never could get a clear crisp image. Every day he had to 're track the controllers, which is a pain when they would have to be reset by plugging them into a usb on the computer. Now this evening the headset won't track. So frustrating to have to spend your whole evening just trying to solve one bug after the other before you even get to play. It will be a great experience down the road when all the bugs are worked out. It was a lot of money for the frustration.

This product didn't last 3 months.  I've had a computer tech out to try to fix it.  He was unable to do so.  Apparently, A LOT of people are having the same issues my son is having.  There is no repair information on the blogs except to restart your computer and hopefully the unit will work.  We've restarted too many times to count.  The unit still isn't working.  I feel that I've thrown away my money and there is no one I can bring it to to repair or replace it.

Go Rift if you are not sure which way to go.  I have had both.  I know the hype is out there for Vive; I know that no reviewer in the world could give a clear answer on Vive vs. Rift... But it is Rift all the way.1) touch is better than vive controllers have used both!2)  Rift is cheaper!  Less than $700 with room scale and touch.3). You get more free games and and additional $100 toward games on Amazon!!!4). Room scale on Rift requires less space!5). Vive is buggy.  My vive kept having issues staring apps after a few days (why I returned it)6). You can play most if not all of the Vive games on Rift AND YOU CAN STILL ISE STEAM AND STEAM VR APP IF YOU WANT TO.  Does not work the other way (not many Rift games can be played on Vive in many cases).7). Many more, better games on Rift8). Rift hardware is more comfortable by a lot and much easier to use and still has better feel and comfort even if you buy the $100 upgrade for vive (deluxe audio strap)!Where is Vive better):1). I like the steam ""home"" app better than Rift BUT you can STILL USE THE STEAM VR HOME APP on Rift!2). Rift app has to be used on one windows account, no share across family unless you use the same user!  But u can use the steam games across accounts using family share on steam.

The HTC Vive is one of a couple VR headsets that you can now use and have a sizable amount of content to do VR stuff in. To compare this product against the competition w/o taking into account the Vive controllers, it really does a great job holding its own. Its tracking system (using 2 lighthouses for RoomScale games or 1/2 for seated stuff) is in my experience very good. I have had 0 issues with the ""world"" moving around me and the chaperon system works really well to tell you information about the outside world in a non-intrusive manner. I have been able to use one lighthouse system at my desk for seated cockpit style games/360 video content with no issues so if you plan on only doing that sort of stuff you don't have to worry about the second lighthouse.The display is a huge talking point especially when comparing this device to the Rift. I have used both devices and I have to say I prefer the VIve for two reasons. First while there is less ""screen door"" effect on the Rift the Vive has a much brighter screen when for me adds a lot to the experience. All content viewed on the Rift is way too dark and there is a known issue with the Rift regarding the picture looking too red. The second positive for the Vive is the larger FOV. A lot of Rift users will say that it is impossible to notice the difference of FOV when comparing the two devices but I can tell. The added FOV is a must for cockpit type experiences. Keep in mind though that with both the Rift and the Vive you are getting a sort of binocular experience where you do see the black rings if you look too far right/left. This will hopefully be improved on in the future with super high FOV changes.So on a basic HMD comparison level I think that the Vive inches in front of the Rift. The main drive towards the Vive however are the RoomScale elements of the device. The ability to move around safely and easily with the added experience of the Touch controllers is a very appealing experience. PLEASE keep in mind that once Oculus releases their own controllers you will be able to do the same content as the Vive (granted the games were coded using the OpenVR SDK) but you will have to jump through more hoops to get it set up. and you will  have issues if you do not set up an additional tracking camera behind you. The Rift is being advertised as a ""standing only"" experience WHICH WILL AFFECT how devs making games under the Oculus SDK program their games. If you want reliable full RoomScale experiences then you should choose the Vive as your HMD.The last thing I want to point out might not pertain to you but I urge you to take it into consideration. Oculus as a company has employed MANY anti-consumer methods in order to artificially grow their marketshare. At one point they locked down their store to only work with the Rift. This meant that games purchased within the store were only usable on the Rift leaving Vive members out in the cold. There are 3rd party workarounds to allow SOME Oculus SDK games to work on the Vive. We were using this method to play Oculus games (which gave support to VR community as a whole). Oculus is more worried about locking in consumers now instead of growing the industry as a whole (the Apple approach to things).They have also bribed developers making Vive games to instead release their games on the Oculus store using the Oculus SDK instead of the OpenVR SDK. This is a big deal because games made under the OpenVR SDK are playable on both the Vive and the Rift while games developed under the Oculus SDK are locked to the Rift in most cases (there is a 3rd party work around for SOME Rift games to be playable on the Vive). Games made under the Oculus SDK are only playable on the Rift. This is a huge detriment to VR as a whole. We do not need to put up barriers on such a small and growing community. Please support developers and companies that use more open devices/technologies.Please do not support a company that obviously only cares about their own well being instead of the industry as a whole. Valve wants VR to be as accessible as possible thus is why they partnered with HTC to create a VR headset. The technology they have developed is accessible to any other company that wants to use it for their own devices. This is huge for VR since it means we might get cheaper and/or better alternatives in the future. If you chose to go with a Rift you are locking yourself in early and it might not be the right choice. If you are serious about getting into VR this early on please go with the Vive.

I opened a ticket for my controller on July 23rd. The large button was no longer registering clicks. Looking online others had the issue and it was a piece inside coming unglued that needed to be fixed. Others opened the controller and fixed it themselves, but since this would void my warranty I sent it in. Tracking showed it was received July 28 at their Houston support center. I never received an email on the repair so i checked the online status. It showed my device was never received. I opened another support case August 23rd to ask on the status of them receiving my controller. I never received a call or email. August 31 I opened a chat request to go over the issue. Now it shows on their repair site as received August 29th. So it basically appears as though my controller was lost at their site for a month. Now with Harvey going through I am being told it may be another week till it can be repaired since they may need parts. So basically I bought a Vive at 700 dollars and now have been without a controller for over a month due to them losing it. So now I am looking into the Occulus for my next system since personally this level of support for a premium item is unacceptable. Also FYI the address they gave me to use for sending in the item UPS could not ship to. It did not follow a standard address scheme. I had to use USPS to get the item to them.

The HTC Vive is an amazing, state of the art VR experience with horrible, 3rd-world customer service.The experience you’ll have using this device is like none other, just make sure you have a capable PC. Amazing visuals, sound, and delight await you. Setup is fairly quick with a little bit of technical know-how. Your friends who have never tried VR will be blown away. The controllers are very comfortable and all of the equipment is extremely well-built and responsive. Nothing at all feels cheap. Except their horrendous customer service.About four months after purchase and fairly light use of the system, the triggers on my controllers began making a grinding noise. It progressively got worse and worse until it became distracting enough to pull me out of the immersive experience I was once having.I reached out to customer service at the end of June as the device was still under warranty. And by reached out, I mean through chat. HTC has no phone number for Vive customer service. This is for a reason. You are dealing with individuals who have no clue how a customer should be treated.They offered to fix the controllers but insisted I pay shipping to their repair facility. Weird and pretty cheap on their end honestly, but okay. Shipped two controllers and received two back within two weeks around the middle of July. Very fast turnaround. Neither controller was fixed.I reached out to them again and was told they mistakenly fixed the trackpad, not the triggers. They apologized, offered to pay shipping to the facility. This time they instructed me to ship the controllers individually using two shipping labels to the same location. Weird, but okay.Within about two weeks I received a package. I thought that my controllers finally arrived and I could get back to using my Vive. Wrong. Only one controller was sent back, and the trigger still wasn’t fixed. The other was missing. I reached out to customer service about the problem. I was told that my ‘repair case’ (oh God) was being elevated and I would now be dealing with someone named Raiza who is going to investigate my unrepaired controller, and the other missing controller. Raiza sent me a delightful email explaining that although I may not hear from her every day, I can rest assured that she’s looking into the issue. This was early August.As of this moment on October 11, I still haven’t heard about or received my missing controller. Raiza has never again contacted me. I was in contact with another individual who asked me to send in my single, unrepaired controller. I did, and they sent back a single, refurbished, physically damaged controller with no explanation about it or my missing controller.This is where I’m at now. I’m admittedly very salty about his whole situation. An expensive but wonderful, immersive and entertaining product is completely tarnished in my eyes because of the worst possible customer service situation that I’ve experienced in my life of 36 years.So beware: If you do invest in this product, and considering all the costs it will be quite an investment, make sure you understand that if something goes wrong with your unit, it won’t be an easy fix. It will be difficult, frustrating, and you’ll feel as if you’re not valued as a customer. And that is such a shame because the HTC Vive has so much potential as a consumer product but unfortunately the ugly side of their customer service may keep people from actually using it.

I contacted HTC, this is how they responded:""In this case, the Bundle for Star Trek is only available for purchases that are done directly through our website, which means that you have to acquire the VIVE directly through us so you can get the email that will contain the Bundle for Star Trek, nevertheless, maybe Amazon can help you with this matter and perhaps they can find a way to provide you with it, I truly wish I could provide you with good news, but unfortunately this is out of my hands since these are the policies from the company and the requirements they stated so customers could get the Bundle, I hope that you understand.""There is no benefit from buying this off of Amazon.

I posted an update at the end of this review.A little context first.  20 years in IT.  Worked with, and in some cases helped design some pretty advanced technology. First tried Autodesk VR at a trade show in the early 90's.  That's how long they've been working on it.  At home we have 5 game consoles, a hand-full of desktop computers for gaming, school and work; several laptops, several tablets and an A/V server to store media and keep all the other computers backed up.  I have an A/V room that I designed with VR in mind.The Vive and the Oculus Rift are the pioneer systems for VR.  From a technology perspective, they are the Osborne luggable computer or perhaps the Sony Betamax VCR.  Maybe the Apple Lisa.  But all of these products, though technical marvels, were failures.  Osborne couldn't find enough buyers.  Betamax couldn't convince studios to go with them instead of VHS and the Apple Lisa, an amazing demonstration of the first practical graphical interface and mouse, was expensive, buggy and lacked viable applications.I feel this way about my Vive.  When it works, it is amazing.  I may never play a flat game again, even though I have a 110 inch projection screen to play them on.  VR is just that good...when it works.But this?  This is a mess!  To use Vive VR, you need a pretty high end computer with a very high end graphics card.  OK, so I updated my AMD Opteron gaming machine with a Gigabyte Radeon RX 480 with 8 gigs of memory.  The card, created pretty much for VR gaming, is buggy and apparently draws more power than it should. (Different review)  All set.It only took a few minutes to get the Vive unboxed and set up in the designated space.  But it took 4 more hours to get everything to work. Compare that to a PlayStation, Xbox or Wii or even a typical PC game or accessory. Plug and play?  Nope, not here.  Everything needed driver and firmware updates and the hand controllers don't ""keep"" firmware updates because of an issue with some USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 ports. So every time somebody turns on the Vive, they have to ""update"" the firmware via USB for the controllers to be recognized wirelessly by the Vive/Steam Dashboard.  Unlike the Wii motion sensor or Xbox Kinect, this was a lot of work to set up, debug and get working and you have to go through an extended set-up; process every time you use the system.Then there are the apps....  Almost everything is ""in development"" or a demonstrator version.  Yes, there are a few really amazing demonstrator programs, like Lab, but so far I haven't found anything I can't get to the end of in one or two sittings.  There are NO real titles?  I look on our video game shelf and see over 100 games there.  Awesome games, immersive games. Creative games. Games like Bioshock, Portal, Halo and a dozen other first-person shooter games that would be AMAZING in VR.  Nope. None for VR?  Really?  Don't these game companies realize how awesome this is?  Well, unfortunately, they do.  But they seem to be waiting for the really big gun game companies to perfect their wares. Sony and Microsoft and Nintendo and the others will all have good quality VR soon enough and those companies have the mainstream audience that will make VR games profitable enough to attract all of the big titles.  Get the whole system down to mass-production prices, say under $1000, and people will buy this all day long.  Make it turn-key.  After all, it's really about the software.  It's ALWAYS been about the software.  Mass produce a great piece of hardware at the right price and the software will appear.In the meantime, I have a really nice VR headset that is not turnkey, is buggy, doesn't have any really good software and is very likely to be as obscure 5 years from now as laserdiscs were after the advent of DVDs.Update:  After getting frustrated with what seems like jittery play, I decided to up the ante and built a dedicated gaming computer just for this HTC Vive set up.  This machine is way up there. Intel I7-6700K CPU, V170 gaming motherboard, 32GB of ram, 1 TB M.2 SSD, a 4TB hybrid SSHD and another Radeon RX 480 G1 gaming video card. Passmark pegs it at nearly 3 times as fast as my AMD machine. This machine is running a fresh copy of Windows 10 and NOTHING but Steam/Steam VR.  All the latest drivers are installed.  Two surprises.  First, the Steam VR Performance test pegs performance at EXACTLY the same as my non-dedicated AMD Opteron based machine with the same model RX-480 graphics card. So the test is all about GPU performance and not at all about CPU performance.  2nd.  Steam VR crashes on this machine.  A lot.  I can get through maybe one round of a game or about 5 minutes in the Vive configuration menu selecting backgrounds before the accelerometers kick out, VR locks up and I get a blank screen on the monitor.  I swapped graphics cards between the two machines with no improvement.  This is probably a resolvable driver issue, but it continues to prove my point that this technology is based on a lot of cobbled together parts that are not designed to be a cohesive system.  So I now have a $2000+ VR system that I am not in a big hurry to play because having a VR game crash is a very abrupt and unpleasant jolt back to reality.Some of you will say your computer runs VR great.  I'm really happy for you.  My whole point here is that this technology SHOULD work out of the box but because it is dependent on a nearly infinite combination of hardware components, it very often does not.  That is what is going to kill it.

VR Headsets are not like fine wine they don't get better as they age so I have no idea why sellers like this one are scalping the price up 40% of the markup. The HTC Vive is a great headset to get into VR but look elsewhere for a better deal on the price. You can get a refurb from HTC directly from their site for $399.Picture quality is okay over all, you'll defiantly see the Screen Door Effect but after a while you get used to it.Lighthouse tracking means it's far more accurate than the Oculus Rift S or Oculus Quest. And even though it's an older HMD it still beats the HTC Cosmos in usability and tracking accuracy.Also games that require 360 degree room-scale for play will NOT play on the Windows Mixed Reality, Cosmos, Rift S, or Quest. They will only play on the Vive, Vive Pro, Valve Index, PiMax, and Oculus Rift CV1. Seems that ""Inside-out tracking"" isn't the end-all be-all.With the HTC Vive you get access to the 360 degree tracking and room scale VR. Yes it's costs a bit more than those other headsets but it's a fair exchange.I also highly recommend the wireless adapter or other methods  of getting the wiring up out of your way. You'll enjoy the headset more when you don't have to worry about a cable getting tangled up around you.

 We have loved every minute of our Vive. Purchased about 6 months ago from the Microsoft store. People from 2 to 102 seems to forget that they are in our living room. We find that it is impossible to oversell how cool it is. I built a PC from scrap parts and traded graphic design work for a GTX970 video card which appears to be plenty of power for most games. I have attached a clip of my friend playing Brookhaven... her reaction is mild compared to some. My 6'2"" brother was in the fetal position screaming when the zombies surrounded him... You figure out pretty quick who's going to make the cut when the apacolypse hits ;)

I waited a long time to try something from the current generation of VR equipment because I was worried that it was a gimmick and it wouldn't be worth it.  Well, I was wrong.  I have not experienced a shred of remorse for buying this baby.  I also haven't showed it to anyone that didn't grin and giggle like a child when they first put on the headset.I bought the original Vive bundle and added the deluxe audio strap (in my opinion it's a must, just for the hard-hat-like twist dial to tighten and loosen it) and some pleather replacement pads to change out the sweat-soaking open-cell foam it ships with.  I've been playing this thing almost non-stop.  It came with six months of Viveport free, which works a bit like EA Origin in that you can play most of their catalog for free as long as you maintain your membership.  I thought that was really neat because it opened me up to just try stuff that I might not have been willing to buy, some of which has been fantastic.The tracking is really, really tight and the immersion is sometimes a little intense.  I haven't had any issues with headaches or nausea either.  The only problems I have are that I know that there is a higher resolution headset available (which I may eventually have to upgrade to) and the wire from the headset to my PC sometimes gets in the way.  There's a wireless upgrade available, but if I'd known that the concept was going to be a win I may have opted to purchase the higher res headset that is natively wireless AND comes stock with the deluxe audio setup.  Aw well, first world problems.

Very happy with my system. I docked a star because the cord is a problem for me.I love video games, but don't like sitting all day to play them, so I usually don't. Enter VR! I'm obsessed. I've had this for 2 years now (12/2018-11/2020) and haven't lost interest yet. Admittedly, I'm easily entertained. But physically active games are the best games! I don't feel bad for playing them, they have kept me entertained and physically active through COVID, and they have strangely had a positive effect on my dreams. The dream thing is worth noting, so I'm totally going to elaborate. I am a woman and I have had bad dreams for as long as I can remember about being attacked and abducted. Now that I am a ninja, gladiator, light saber dancer, zombie killer, and archer extrodenaire during some of my waking hours, when I have dreams about being attacked, I end up kicking ass. It is weird, but also kinda makes sense and is a favorable development. Needless to say, I am a big fan of the htc vive pro so far.Note that I have a separately purchased wireless that doesn't work (separate, scathing review on that product is in the appropriate place elsewhere). I might try one of the harness systems next to fix the cord problem, but I wish the vive came with a solution given the price. Oh well. I still love it.

I demoed an original Vive in 2016 and immediately fell in love, but life got in the way and it was never ""the right time"" to buy one for myself. Luckily, that time came this year and I had extremely high expectations.[SETUP]The box comes with a very easy to follow guide to install an even easier to follow (and fun) software guide that you install on your computer. Setting up the lighthouses/base stations was a bit of an endeavor for me, as I'm not overly experienced with a drill, but I managed to get them up in about 30 - 45 minutes. The software guide explained where to install and how to angle the base stations and I was able to achieve next to perfect tracking in all corners of my room.[INITIAL CONNECTION/UPDATING]Connection was a breeze, but updating the firmware of my controllers was slightly tricky. I had to manually restart them in the middle of their updates to get them to proceed to the final step. All in all, updating took about 10 minutes.[FIRST LAUNCH]I noticed I was getting very motion sick when I first started playing and I realized this was caused by three things. The first is the most obvious: smooth locomotion. Start out with teleporting (can be changed in most game settings) if you're new to VR, or you'll have an unpleasant experience. The second was something I should have realized sooner, which was my headset adjustment. It was very blurry and I was getting migraines within minutes. There are some helpful videos on YouTube that I watched to assist me in properly positioning my HMD on my face/head, which in turn alleviated the migraines I was experiencing and allowed me to get a clearer picture. Lastly, I encountered stuttering/lagging within SteamVR and SteamVR Home, but I resolved this by opting in to SteamVR beta within Steam, so nothing related to the headset.All in all, I can't say I've ever been happier with a purchase. I'd recommend this highly. Paired with the Index controllers and some body trackers, this is a very solid setup.

We originally purchased the system online through Dell and sat on it for a month or so because we were in the process of buying our first home.  When we finally did get the system up and running, it only functioned properly for about 2 hours.  The second time we tried to use it, the headset malfunctioned.  We tried all of the suggestions on HTC's website on how to resolve the issue and couldn't get the thing to work.  Finally, we reached out to HTC support and were instructed to send the headset in for repair because there was an internal headset error and the system was still under the 12 month limited warranty.  They received it and did not communicate with us AT ALL regarding the progress.  We reached out a few weeks later to see what was going on and were told the headset had water damage and would cost $270 to fix.  They argued that water damage wasn't covered under their limited warranty.  There was no way that headset got water damaged unless it was from the little bit my husband sweated while playing it ONE time.  I researched the issue and found HTC removed the ""sweat"" clause from their limited warranty 2 months prior to our purchase (probably because so many people were sending in non-functional headsets for repair).  We called back and were told that in addition to the water damage, we had purchased the system from an unauthorized reseller, further voiding the warranty.  Dell has informed me that that claim is non-factual.  Basically, HTC was giving us the run around and refused to issue a replacement or proceed with the repair until they got more money from us.  I was livid and spent the better half of a day scouring the internet to find contact info for someone at their headquarters (the repair center is less than useless).  Finally found the contact info for John Gibson, who is the Vive Director for HTC.  I urge anyone experiencing the same problems with HTC Vive customer service to get a hold of him.  I had to tell him we talked with our state attorney general who enlightened us to the consumer protection laws that protect us from these types of problems.  HTC was in violation of the Deceptive Trade Practice Act and Consumer Rights Act and we threatened to pursue the issue if we couldn't reach a resolution.  Needless to say, less than 2 weeks after making contact with Mr. John Gibson, we now have a brand new, fully functional headset.  It's been sitting in its box ever since.In summary, I would NOT recommend HTC Vive or HTC products to anyone.  EVER.  Under any circumstance.  In fact, our experience was so abysmal, I'm making it my personal goal to discourage as many people as possible from purchasing this product.  I'm being completely honest when I say it's not worth the money, stress, or hassle.At the very least, research HTC vive issues/consumer complaints prior to purchase.  I certainly wish I would have.  Seems a LOT of people are experiencing the same issues we had.Our replacement headset has been sitting in the closet.  We are too afraid to use it.  Shame, for $500.

Short version: very good VR for what is available today, very expensive. Possibly worth waiting for the next generation.Poorly written, longer version:  If you're like me, you bought a Vive and thought, ""well this is cool, but that screendoor sucks and this strap feels like 15cents of corner cutting."" Then maybe you got a different face cushion because the original one feels like a sandpaper sponge and thought ""this is what the vive should have come with on day one.""  THEN maybe you got a deluxe audio strap and thought ""now at least it FEELS good and doesn't need some crazy headphone set up."" Then HTC announced this thing, and it seemed like a bunch of things checked off the average vive owners wishlist. Except the price tag. It's important to note that the ""Pro"" here, really does mean professional. As in business. As in not designed specifically for gaming, porn or whatever it is you're doing in VR. Enterprise users eat these things up and have the budgets to do so.The display is a VAST improvement, the screendoor effect is next to gone, super sampling and anti-aliasing MOSTLY resolves any lingering issues, you can read text, the usable field of view at least feels wider. But at times I just wish it had better lenses and more pixels, same as I felt with monitors before 1080.That said, is it worth upgrading to from the Vive? Only if the price tag is not a huge deal to you, if you're the kind of person who upgrades their video card every year for that minor improvement in FPS in 4 year old games that is beyond what the human eye can even notice but you really really, really want people to know how virile you are, go for it.  If you're a regular person, who is intrigued by the technology but doesn't have so much disposable income that they throw their luxury cars down the sewer rather than be bothered to put more gas in it, consider a lower priced set up.

I was so excited about buying this! When I got it, I took it out of the box immediately and installed and did everything according to instructions and installation process. I played a couple of games but mostly vrchat the rest of the evening. I got back on vrchat this morning and everything was fine until the sound went out on my headset. After turning my computer off and back on, the sound worked again. Ok cool. I log back into vrchat and everything is fine and then out of nowhere, my left controller suddenly un-syncs. I uninstall the entire software, and reinstall it. Right controller syncs up immediately. Left controller doesn't. I charged the controller fully and did everything correctly. The controller just completely stopped syncing with the headset. I talked to vive customer service and they want me to send the controller to them so they can fix it and then give it back to me but they told me I'm looking at a 2-3 month waiting period of getting it back. Who wants to wait that long on something they spent over $1000 on? Not me. I gave it 2 stars for customer service since they were willing to solve the problem...but as much as I paid for this, it's not worth the problem so I am sending it back and getting my money refunded.

Firstly let me tell you I’ve owned every VR Headset, since day 1! Preordered HTC Vive OG, Occulus before the touch even existed, and preordered PS4VR.Hands down #1 VR experience HTC Vive winner winner chicken dinner!!!Occulus, god help your soul of your wife or someone moves a sensor? Not to mention you need a 3rd for total Emerson or the game pauses and says turn around! Dumb!!! Second smallest gaming libraryPlayStation Vr is only for people that can’t afford a PC sensor and tracking the worst of all 3, smallest field of view As well. Smallest gaming libraryHTC Vive, room setup, free games, tracking, wireless and unparrelled experience for all VR, I upgraded to the pro for the larger play space, upgraded light cubes, and higher resolution, also upgraded to wireless and that makes it an entirely diffeeent experience all togeather!! Imagine not caring where the computer is or where your pointing your limited to your boundaries of play space! No getting tangled or wrapped up? Or Worrring about ripping the cables out of your computer. If you’ve ever let others play your VR you know the stress involved in watching them move around rapidly while entangled inyour VR cables.If you want VR and the best expsoerience possible the HTC Vive is the only consumer VR I would suggest AAAand now viveport infinity will be 8.00 a month for 5 games a month.

So far, so good. I'm a new user with this pro version, so I can't attest to it's rugged longevity, but right now it's kicking tail. My son has the regular Vive, which is the only one I've worked with until I bought the pro. There is a clear difference in screen quality between the two. For me, that's worth it. If you're having trouble, I found working seriously on the head adjustments, cleaning inside lenses with pro wipes etc. helps a lot. You need to get your eyes centered correctly. Also, you might need to consider buying a serious rig to run it. I'm using a water-cooled I-9, 64 gigs of DDR4 ram, and a Geforce RTX 2080. That's a pretty high-end system, and it's as smooth as glass. If you're using some kind of laptop... well... you probably should stick with the basic model. That said, you don't HAVE to have a top-end system. You can get pretty good performance with a system that's more in the $1200 range, but it won't be as dramatic of an upgrade from the base Vive. I bought the best for the experience and future generations of equipment.Good and bad:Good: lenses are great with some power behind them.Middling: the headphones are pretty generic, but they work. I took them off immediately and put on a set of Bose sound-cancelling muffs that really help with the immersion. Coupled with a Subpac audio vest to give you feedback, you can bluetooth to the Subpac then run wired from that to the headphones. At that point you're really living it.Bad: the price is upsetting. Taken altogether, I could have bought a decent used car for the amount I put into the pc and the VR gear and the software.

After a buddy brought over his Oculus Quest I was completely blown away and started researching VR. Built a PC and picked up the Vive Pro. After the painstaking setup and fairly steep learning curve just using the thing I realized this is the exact same resolution and even though I’m powering it with an $800 video card the visual experience is barely any better than the $400 Oculus Quest. The controllers are large and awkward and it’s so much more complicated to use, not to mention you have a thick wire sticking out of it grazing your shoulder and that you can trip on.Save yourself thousands (I spent $3k all in between the PC and the Vive Pro) and pick up the Oculus Quest for $399. My buddy brings it over in it’s little box and has us playing games within a minute, with no wires, and much sleeker and more intuitive controllers.Total disappointment.

Virtual reality takes me to new places and provides a fun workout experience right in my living room.PROS:- Higher resolution - makes text much easier to read, especially at lens edges.  Bright, colorful, crisp.  Greatly reduced SDE (screen door effect) - I never notice it.  Better view distance.- Integrated headphones - very adjustable and sounds crisp (nice 3D spatial sound).  Haven't had issues with the volume.  If you want booming bass, hook up a subwoofer.- Comfort - it just feels right.  Easily accomodates all types of glasses.  Put on, take off, with minimal effort.  No discomfort even after hours of use.- Excellent software library.  The Vive caters to the indie developer community so you'll find all sorts of games and experiences.  Plays Rift games too with ReVive.- Version 2.0 tracking system is more efficient, and allows more robust communication between the base stations and sensors.  It provides much more than just a larger play area.- Room scale is absolutely amazing.  Tracking is near perfect.  I only have a 6'x7' play area, and it works well.  The more space, the better!- Vive setup - easy step-by-step visual walkthrough guiding you through the process.  The Chaperone system is very accurate and keeps you in your play area.- Future proof - 2 cameras, which can allow hand tracking and other uses; increased resolution can be utilized by AAA games; 2.0 tracking is more advanced.CONS:- Price.  Not yet affordable enough for most mainstream users.  Seems to be priced for business use and VR enthusiasts.- Setup takes some time (about 1-2 hours).  You need to update the firmware on your controllers and headset (easy to do using Steam VR).- The setup app assumes you use version 1.0 base stations.  The updated information was found by searching the Vive website.  A little confusing at first.- Doesn't include 'knuckles' type controllers - still uses the original wand design.  It still works well, but no finger gestures.  Hopefully Valve gets this released soon.TIPS:- If you have audio issues with the headphones, update the firmware and adjust the audio settings in the Vive and Steam VR apps.- Wear a sweatband to absorb sweat and protect the headset from damage, especially if working out.- You might want to buy controller protector guards for the wands (to prevent damaging them if you hit them against something).- The tracking system works best in a play area free of reflective surfaces (glass, mirrors, etc.).- 'The Lab' is an awesome FREE game/experience collection available for download on Steam - this will demonstrate the potential of the Vive.THOUGHTS:- I was going to hold out and wait for ""2nd gen VR"", but the current gen is refined and mature, with plenty of content.  The Vive Pro is the next big step to 2nd gen VR, especially with wireless tech and better controllers coming soon.  A wider FOV (field of view) doesn't necessarily equate to a better experience; it's all about the content and support.  Having done much research into all the major VR headsets, and having used the Rift before, I feel the Vive Pro is the best option out there for anyone wanting the best VR experience NOW.  It's a good option for developers, too, as Vive is more open platform.

My son bought this back in April. Then, a few months ago the controller pads stopped working correctly. As many others have noticed, this is a very well known design flaw. You will find all kinds of reports of this online, yet HTC won't admit there's a problem. He contacted Vive customer support and did, however, get asked to send his controllers in and they would be repaired under warranty. About a couple weeks later his 3 in 1 video cable developed a short in the cable that caused the video to go completely black for lengths of time. Eventually, it went black and wouldn't come back on AT ALL. He submitted a warranty claim and was told by a rep that he is past his 12 month warranty and they couldn't help him. He replied back and eventually went through 3-4 reps who wouldn't help him for the same reason. He even sent back a copy of his dated purchase receipt proving it was still under warranty. He was told since he purchased an EXTENDED warranty he would have to go through that company. However, that company said they won't do anything because he's still within the manufacturer warranty. He finally got someone at HTC who told him that while he was outside of his manufacturer warranty they would give him a ""one time courtesy escalation"" and would send him a replacement cable anyway. In the meantime, while this is all happening, his controllers were repaired, under warranty, and sent back to him. They have since asked him to let them know how the controllers are working, but he cannot tell them because he has no video cable, therefore no way to test them. It's been WEEKS since they said they would send the cable but every time he asks where it is they tell him it's out of stock. I'll bet my ass they have enough cables to fulfill new orders, though!! And how is it one rep can tell he's within his warranty but others say he's out of warranty even though he's shown them the purchase receipt?!?! This is the most inane customer service I think I've ever seen from a company. When the product works, it's great and a lot of fun, but don't hold your breath if you need customer service from the manufacturer. They are a complete joke!!!

I have a Nvidia GTX 1080 graphics card and I DID notice a significant increase in image and text quality. However I could only fully enjoy it one eye at a time, since the minimum setting for the lens distance was too far apart for my eyes.  Also, the new shape and size for the foam was not a good fit for my small narrow face. The sides and bottom barely touched my face and I felt a disproportionate pressure on my forehead when the headset was properly secured. When I would loosen it to relieve pressure on my forehead, I felt a lot of pressure on the top of my head, causing the whole thing to feel very heavy.  Additionally, I was excited to use this headset to play Fallout 4, but discovered that the image stuttered horribly in many areas. I tried a few fixes and adjusted settings to increase performance, including disabling all Anti-Aliasing, and still had the problem quite noticeably. I didn't try everything possible, but considering the overall discomfort of the headset, I decided to return it to HTC and sticking with my original Vive with the Deluxe Audio Strap.

The product itself is fantastic. Great resolution (even for reading text), great fit, accetable setup (albeit a tad finnicky), and great tracking with two base stations (considering getting a 3rd to reduce occlusion). Battery life on the controllers is also pretty great. Onboard headphones fit decently and sound accetable.My main issues come down to three things...1. Lack of end user support options - unlike a computer, you can't just get the drivers of a part that has a broken driver. You must uninstall and redownload all the drivers for every part of the headset at once...2. Questionable onboard microphone construction quality - despite the micriphone physically still working (can hear surrounding sound vua room view), mine seems to have failed on the software side of things. This is a consistent issue I've seen across the vive community, but the best fix seems to be buying a third party vive mounted microphone. That's not a fix, it's a replacement.3. HTC Support - When a problem occurs, HTC support requests a load of trouble shooting tests and requests diagnostic data from SteamVR. After all is said and done, they suggest sending it in to have further tests done and repairs made if needed. Responses from HTC support seems to take a week on average, and once sent in (out of pocket), they run a diagnostic again and quote you for a price to repair. If not paid, they mail it back to you. They also suggest not shipping it back in original packaging because the box may not be able to be returned... take that as you will...All that being said, I'm still happy with my purchase but would recommend the Vive, Oculus, or wait for one of the new headsets to come out if your on the fence about this headset.

I will join the other negative reviews and say that I've had issues with this headset since the beginning.  The sound did not work properly in the right ear (cut in and out, then would go out entirely) which I found out is a common problem with researching this online.  There is no phone number for help, and online chat is terrible (assuming you find someone who speaks English).  I sent it back for repair, which was a nightmare process, only to receive it back with issues in the opposite ear.I strongly recommend you read the fine print before purchasing this headset, and understand that your support options are very severely limited.  I would never recommend this headset to anyone, not because of the headset, but because of what HTC is putting me through for a headset that has not worked properly since day 1... over 4 months ago.

Would be the best headset if the headphones didn't lack requiring you to buy or print headphone clips. Also you should do the gear mod making it the clarity zone better. Htc vive has the same issue. The tracking is top tier. The visuals are amazing. The blacks are so black. It makes the light to dark pop. The index on the other hand has pretty sub par blacks do to the lcd screens. The index has much better headphones. They are like speakers off of your ear. This headset is very comfortable. It has less FOV than the index but you can get pretty close with different face pads. But again the picture is stunning in the vive pro. I would recommend the vive pro with the index controllers if you have the money. This is a gray area. If you dont want to spend the money the rift s is the best bet. Great controllers. great headset. The tracking is lacking compared to the tech these use. Fully playable but the base stations are superior. VR is had to find the personal sweet spot. I personally like the best light to dark and tracking. This HMD covers it.

My experience with HTC Vive is that it is a complete piece of junk.  My friend's daughter got one for Christmas, and they contacted me when they could not get it to work, even after they spent hours online with the company's technical support specialists.I am an engineer and make very good money to get things to work when the efforts of others have failed.The HTC Vive has been a complete waste of time and money.  I have about 6 hours of my life that I cannot get back trying to troubleshoot this overly-complicated unit.One tip is that there are certain USB controllers that seem to have issue detecting the HTC Vive headset.  As such, I ordered a USB controller card that was known to work with the HTC Vive and tried that as well, but still no joy.The online technical support has a script that they run through painstakingly each time you contact them, and it will take you and them no less than 2 hours to troubleshoot the headset not detected (error code 108) issue.The combination of hardware, drivers, and software that all have to be working correctly to make this go is overly complex.  I struggle to understand how a USB port on a computer that works fine for keyboard, mouse, flash drive, etc. will not work with the HTC Vive.  The USB controller card detected the HTC Vive, but the SteamVR software still failed to detect the headset.  There are more than a dozen physical connections required for the system to work because there is a 'link box' foolishly injected in between the PC and the Vive headset in what I judge to be a design failure.The PC on which the unit was being installed exceeded all of the minimum system requirements, and all troubleshooting steps published on their online site and prescribed by their technical support specialists were performed to the letter.  They even paid for shipping and sent a 2nd HTC Vive unit and it still did not work.I cannot recommend the HTC Vive to anyone who values their time and money.  I had to fight the urge to smash this one with a sledge hammer just for the therapeutic relief.  They're sending it back to the vendor.

I've done extensive testing with these headphones and plan to do more, but you may want to read what I'm about to write.I built an enthusiast server gaming rig a little over a year ago for $5,000. Needless to say, I didn't worry at all about my PC being able to handle VR. The problem is, that I should have worried. Everything was fine until I started modding for skyrim VR. I did over 120 hours of modding and I pushed my PC to its limit.with an overclocked CPU and GPU, I was able to handle the best the modding community could provide with my VR, but my normal 200+ fps dropped to a steady 40 - 60 fps. I really made my computer do some heavy lifting, but I decided to test further (not just on skyrim).Everyone talks about it online, but it's another to see it for yourself. VR takes some seriously good equipment. You can run a basic ryzen cpu with a gtx 1060 and you can get away with most things on minimal graphics, but honestly, when running VR, I've found that you will want to have a 1070 on average to handle most things.(I did my own benchmarks with a 1060, 1070, and 1080)(I also bench marked with multiple different CPU's. Though it was important to have a good CPU, I found that the GPU was more important, as long as your CPU didn't bottleneck your GPU)Overall, I would recommend making sure you have the proper hardware for this. Make sure you have a good enough GPU + CPU or else you're going to run into many problems.Other than hardware, I freaking love these. I personally want to get my hands on the pro one day, but I couldn't justify the price of the pro. The pro is obviously an improvement, but it was more than double the price. And when you put these headphones on, you honestly don't care. You've got VR headphones and you'll love it.overall, just get it if you have the money + hardware. It's something I've wanted for a while and don't regret at all

Returned this product.  It took a long time to figure out how to set up and download a number of files. You do need a powerful PC but once we set it up my kids became nauseated by the games.  I don't think the technology is quite there yet.  The graphics are mediocre.  I can't recommend this product for the average family.  I suggest you try it out at an electronics store before you buy. Glad Amazon has a great return policy.

This is a review for the HTC VIVE and I am comparing it against its current competitors (11-28-16)This VR Headset will enagùble you to immerse yourself in VR environments and games. It is pricey but it is where technologiùy is  at right now. Should you buy it?If you can dispose of a couple of thousand dollars or have an already very capable PC and are an enthusiast of computer thingy, hell yeah.First offç you will need a capable computer to run this. I have n i7-6700k, 32gb RAM, 500gbSSD (main drive) and a GTX1070 8gb and it runs it perfectly. You can run the SteamVR Perforfomance Test to make sure your system can handle it. Mine Scores 11 and, as I said, it runs it perfectly.Now for the headset. People say it is hard to install but I have found no problems whatsoever. Installing the 2 lighthouses (2 boxes that go on the wall at least 2 meters above the ground) was piece of cake. I used one of those velcro with adhesive on one side that they sell at Wallgreens and holds up to 16 lbs. Angle down about 45 degrees and make sure the lighthouses can see each others.Plug all the cables in the box that comes with the VIVE and plug the cables from the computer to the box. Then go on the website provided in the HTC VIVE box and it helps you set it up. Then you need to set up the room space. If you have at least 2x2meters of clear space you will have no problems doing this. It took me about 30 minutes from opening the box to be able to play the first game. Again, if your computer is not ready for a vR headset you might have to throubleshoot and that will take some time.I would highly recommend this VR Headset.I also have had the Oculus Rift (CV1) so, this is my comparison:VIVE Pros:Room scale experience out of the box.Hand controllers add a lot to the experience.Easy to install and Steam is a breeze to download games.Adjustments to the lenses can be made not only for the Pupillary Distance but also allowing you to move the lenses further away from your face so that you can wear glasses.Chaperone mode is amazing to avoid hitting walls and objects.The camera under the headset is great when you hear a noise in the house and want to check it out without removing the headset. Also, if you double click a button on the hand controller, a real time feet of the room (kind of looks like the sonar image from DareDevil) will allow you to see without removing the headset (good for using items in real life like a phone or a beer).Condensation is non existent in the VIVE. My Oculus would get foggy so quickly it was absurd.Cons:Lenses not as sharp as the Oculus Rift (still very sharp but not quite as the hybrid lenses of the Oculus)The foam between the headset and your face is not very breathable. Since you move around a lot with the VIVE you will sweat profusely. Oculus seemed more breathable. I have purchased separate face foams.I have. A big nose and, if you use thinner face foam which allows you to get a better sweet spot on the lense, my headset touches my nose and it gets annoying after a few hours. I am still working on fixing this.God s Rays (google it) but not nearly as bad as the Oculus.Oculus Pros:Hybrid Lenses have a better optic quality than VIVEàs Fresnels.Lighter and less bulky overall.Thats pretty much it.Cons:Gets foggy quickly.Cannot change the distance of the lenses to the faceCan only install apps and games on main HD which, for a lot of users, is usually an SSD with smaller capacity and placing games on it will make you run out of room pretty quickly.Oculus support is fast but does not help solve any problemWhile it is faster to plug in the device (less wires) the software set up can take longer due to bugs.Always have to take the headset on and off due to the lack of camera. You are not able to see anything in real life without removing the headset. It doesnt seem like a big deal but you have to completely take your headset off, If you lift the headset and rest it on your forehead your hair (assuming you have some) will touch the lenses and leave oils on them.It can be used for room scales experiences but it is mostly for sitting down experiences.Less content for Oculus than HTC VIVE.Very pronounced God s Rays (google it)No Chaperone mode means headset monitor (other objects collision)happens from time to time.No hand controllers (as of today 11/28/16, will be out by the end of this year...unless same thing as the preordered headset will happen this time)They have developed a software (ASW) which allows less powerfull cards to run the Oculus. As long as you can run 45 fps the software double is to 90 so that the experience is more tolerable. I used it with my GTX750Ti and it worked ,not well, but it worked. The problem is that if you have a better card and that it seldom goes lower than 90fps, ASW kicks in creating stuttering video. At least that is whats happened in my case. No way to turn it off.ConclusionI have negative feelings about the Oculus company ever since they delayed the shipping of their preorders.I gave them a chance and still bought the Oculus but found it to be lacking the features I was expecting. I cant understand why they would make it hard (if not impossible) to install games on other drives other than the main one.Overall Oculus feels like an Indie company who have made a great product (for an indie) but, it is priced equal to the HTC VIVE which is made by a huge company and has been around (with controllers) for longer. There is more content for the VIVE and the room scale experience is unbelivable.Oculus now has Facebook supporting them, and in the future it may catch up if not even surpass HTC in the VR field but, for now, I returned my Oculus and will stick with the VIVE. If I had to choose, I would buy the HTC VIVE (assuming you have at least 2x2 METERS of unobstructed space but I would highly recommend 3x3 METERS).Get the Oculus if all you want to do is sitting and watch 3d Porn.

Some people have predicted that all Gyms will use VR in the future, because normal exercise equipment is so boring that you can only think about exersize. But in VR, you don't feel like you are exercising, even when exerting yourself.  Vive even advertises the fact that some games ""give you a workout"" and ""make you sweat"". Games like Gorn and BeatSabre are impossible to play without sweating.If the device was sweat-proof, I'd give it a 5/5.Unfortunately, the product is NOT sweat-proof. Even worse, Vive has decided that sweat damage is not covered under warranty.  Mine died for no apparent reason after 2 months. I stent it in, and they said it had ""liquid damage"" and wanted to charge half the value to repair it. Fortunately, I found a youtubue video that said to email their customer support and they fixed it for free, but ""just this once"". Arg, why the run-around?  Even though they fixed it, I'm very unhappy that the product has such a fatal flaw.If you buy this, (and I do recommend it: it's a lot of fun), you must understand that the system was just not designed correctly. It's up to the customer to always use sweatbands and VR Covers to prevent sweat from getting into this device.  We can only hope in the future that manufacturers realize that these devices need to be 100% ""sweat-proof"".Edit: It died two weeks after sending it back in. (And just after writing a 2-star review.) Lowering to 1 star.

The Vive Pro checks all of these boxes that no other HMD does:- Beautiful AMOLED screens with deep blacks & a full range of color- Low screen-door effect and a clear picture- Best wireless support available, with near zero latency -- this alone is a huuuge win- Compatible with everything -- games, base stations, Index Controllers...- Extremely comfortable out of the box with good audio""Wireless + AMOLED"" alone is something no PC headset does or is planning to.Cosmos & Index are both washed-out LCDs.It's only really beat in one area -- FOV.But Pimax lacks wireless, low-SDE & OLED, compatibility, and comfort.I hold that the Vive Pro is still the single strongest (if massively overpriced) HMD / ecosystem out there in 2019.

Where to begin.... I got this as a gift for Christmas, and I will say that I had a TON of fun with this for the ~2 weeks that I had it.  After about 2 weeks of use, though, the headset flickered and shut down while I was using it.  I went through a list of troubleshooting steps with HTC support only to arrive at the conclusion that it needed to be sent in - fine, fair enough.HTC doesn't provide you with a shipping label for their RMAs so I had to pay almost 50$ to send the device in.  I obviously had the tracking number so I was able to see when it arrived, but it took their repair center almost A WEEK to mark the device as received - I had to start another support chat with them (their only option for support) just to make sure it wasn't lost somewhere between delivery and the repair center.After sitting at 'waiting for repair' for several days, a quote showed up on my ticket.  I looked into it to find they wanted $270 to fix the headset due to ""liquid damage"".  The unit was never around any kind of liquid except sweat from normal use (which I took care to wipe away frequently).  I started a third chat with their god-awful support only to get absolutely nowhere, and now I'm left with the option to pay $270 to fix the headset (after paying $50 to send it) or just never use the unit again.I REALLY wish I had read some of the massive amount of complaints out there about these things dying within days/weeks due to condensation or sweat on the unit.  If you decide to take the risk and buy one of these (which I DO NOT recommend), take great care to make sure it stays as dry as physically possible, and take it away from your warm face often so that condensation doesn't build up in it.  If it breaks at all, prepare to battle with HTC support for a month and fork over the cost of the new Vive.I'll never buy another HTC product after buying this.

The Vive has phenomenal tracking, and is still the only true room-scale VR setup. (After getting caught off-guard by the Vive's far superior tracking, Facebook spliced together something they can sell as ""room-scale"" for the Rift, but it requires buying an extra sensor and isn't as reliable as the Vive's.)The Vive's content selection used to be a big concern. While there's been a growing quantity of games since launch, many of them are under-budgeted indie passion projects (i.e. cheap-feeling compared to Facebook-funded Oculus exclusives). But with Fallout 4 VR set to launch in December and Payday 2 getting a VR mode, the platform finally has some AAA flagships to plant its flag on – and cancel out some of Oculus' advantage in the content department.Other titles worth checking out include Arizona Sunshine (zombie shooter with a silly story, but incredibly immersive gameplay), Raw Data (multiplayer sci-fi shooter), Job Simulator (the best intro to VR, and great for laughs), and The Lab (Valve's collection of VR mini-games).You can also use a third-party hack called ReVive to play Oculus-exclusive games on the Vive. I recommend Robo Recall, Mage's Tale, Superhot VR, and Killing Floor: Incursion, though you may run into (usually minor) incompatibilities when played on the Vive.HTC keeps adding modular accessories, which I have mixed feelings about. On one hand, the Deluxe Audio Strap adds comfort and Trackers will add immersion to the experience after more games support them. But on the other hand, you're taking an already-expensive platform and requiring even more money to squeeze out the best experience. Moving forward, I hope ecosystem complexity doesn't completely run amok: VR needs simplicity to move beyond the fringes of geekdom.While it's expensive and got off to a rocky content start, the Vive has improved of late in both of those departments. If you can live with the cost, it's the best VR money can buy.

I did not buy this product on Amazon, but I am so annoyed with the customer service that I didn't know where else to leave them a poor review. Almost a year after I bought the Vive, I started getting driver update notices. I noticed that I would loose tracking every now but it would still work. Finally, about a month later, I finally contacted customer support. They gave me suggestions (I also was contacting about faulty wireless headset). Another month goes by and I realize that my one of the base stations is flat out not even working. They refused to cover it even though I originally had the issue before the warranty expired and I had initially contacted them a week after the warranty expired. So yes, they legally can disregard my claim. However, they finally agreed to repair the base station for a reduced priced. A fair compromise in my opinion. However, after I sent in the base station for repair, they ""had no record"" of such a promise. They told me I should have taken a screen shot. The manager that I got the deal with told me that this would be noted in my repair ticket.Anyways, if I could do it over again, I would not go with any HTC product, although I did enjoy VR while everything was functional (hence 2 stars instead of 1). The base station and wireless headset have not functioned as promised, and they have horrible customer service!

The Vive is a cool headset and I enjoyed my time with it, but the tech simply isn't good enough to cross the barrier between early adopter and mainstream user. Folks obsessed with technology (or those who enjoy a particular VR game, like maybe Beat Saber or Skyrim) probably have what they want here, but for someone looking to say, mirror the movie theater experience or just get more deeply immersed into a new world, the quality/comfort factor hasn't yet hit the right spot.The screen door effect on the Vive screen is VERY noticeable. It's like staring through a fine honeycomb  lattice. The setup is also a chore; LOTS of cables, LOTS of tweaking. These are small things. They're not dealbreakers if what you're here for is the EXPERIENCE of VR, and if you enjoy being on the tech frontline.It's not bad. But I don't think it's worth the hassle quite yet. A couple of generations in when the headset weight comes down and the screen quality goes up, it'll be a better bet. And hopefully by then there will be a wider library of VR-specific things rather than ports of other stuff or haphazard tech demos.If you're super into the promise of VR and want to get in now, the Vive is probably worth it. If you're still on the fence, I'd say wait for Vive 2 or whatever.

Grabbed one last week at full price, and not regretting it one bit.Since the Rift is now $460 for full room-scale (have to buy a third sensor), the choice is really yours as to what product/company you want to support.  I am personally a fan of the way that the HTC Vive has been more open about it's business practices, and forward-thinking about it's peripherals (knuckles controllers, anyone?), but the choice is yours.No defects, runs decently on my rig with an i5-4590k OC'd to 4.2 ghz and an AMD r9 290x (roughly equivalent to a GTX 970).  I will say, however, that I am on the lower end of graphical fidelity, and I would suggest picking this up ONLY if you have at least the specs above, and no lower.  I am already thinking about updating my graphics card so that I can crank up the super-sampling.Another thing to keep in mind is space.  I have a (what I would consider) ""normal sized"" living room, and with the couch pushed back against the wall, I just barely have enough space for room-scale.  If you are picking this up just for seated experiences (Elite: Dangerous, Subnautica, Racing games/sims, American Truck Sim, etc.), that isn't really an issue, but the Vive really shines with it's room-scale experiences.Have fun, and welcome to the future!

My grandson saved and saved and finally bought one. It was great. It exceeded our expectations and we had a lot of fun. Until it quit. We contacted the Vive people and they asked us to send it to them for checking and repair. We did. Almost 4 months ago. Since then we have had little satisfaction. The only way to talk is through online chat and that has been less than stellar. We still have had no resolution. I decided to call the customer service people at HTC. They said they do not support Vive. Only the Vive division does and the only way to talk to them is online chat. I told them that online chat was useless and I wanted to talk to a person. They said they would email them my phone numbers and promised me a phone call within 48 hours. No such luck.The only thing I can say is-if you buy one-cross your fingers and hope it doesn't quit.

I did not purchase my Vive from Amazon, and I wish I did now that they are selling it directly.I got my Vive second hand, and with a Leap Motion, but you're reading this because you want to know about the Vive itself.I started messing around with VR using my Blackberry Priv, which has one of the highest PPI for screens on the market. I get a fancy plastic Google Cardboard headset. It's pretty cool. Watch a few movies in a VR movie theater, flew over some cliffs in the Cardboard demo, watched some VR Porn. It's all fantastic and it's a very good place to start your journey in VR. I say that because once you go from Cardboard to this.... you will lose your mind.The Vive has a sense of scale and presence that you can NOT (absolutely not) get from playing games in a 2D space (even though the games are rendered in 3D polygons). You are literally THERE, IN THE GAME.I started my Vive adventure with Job Simulator. It starts with you in a giant lobby. You look up and feel how large the room is. You see computers zooming about. In front of you is a stand for the simulators and you can feel how large it is, you feel like it's right in front of you. You can walk around, bend down and look under something, kneel, etc.I later played Vanishing Realm. A dungeon crawler RPG where you actually get to fight and swing and parry.I later played Waltz of the Wizard where I was a wizard concocting spells in my lab and using those spells to effect the world around me.Then I played a demo where I was in a futuristic LA, the buildings where tall and mechanical and over each other. Almost like Bladerunner or Judge Dredd. I was on a balcony and I just sat there listening to the rain fall and watching the traffic go buy.I later played my favorite game... Minecraft, but this time I was there! I saw how big the blocks are, I actually got to punch trees and built a house around myself. There is nothing like it.There is a bit of tunnel vision and screen door effect, and I have 20/20, but let me tell you, ALL of that fades away once you are in the game. You don't notice ANY of that. The worlds take you away, you are there, you interact, you walk around (and the chaperone makes sure you don't smash into the walls).The setup was decent and I imagine it varies person to person. I was done setup in less than 10 minutes, but I had already saw the system set up before I purchased. The VR room setup is easy and tells you exactly what to do.My rig:Core i7-6700K, 32GB DDR4-3200, Dual GTX980TI AMP! Extreme's with a slight overclock, 1TB 850 Pro SSD, and 6TB of mechanical storage. The games played great, did have a few hang ups when quitting games, but the headset has a VR launch button built in.If you are nervous about the purchase, find someone near you who has one, check for Best Buy demos, check for Microsoft Stores, or maybe Craigslist for someone who is demoing it. However, I KNOW you'll love this, it has forever changed the way I will game, and I haven't even gotten to the paid games yet (or the porn).

This is currently the best headset for the enthusiast and early adopter crowd albeit expensive and does not yet entirely eliminate SDE.Speaking of SDE: This is akin to going from 720p to 1080p, but not 1440 or even 2160. The SDE is dramatically reduced and honestly, what these headsets should have been at when shipped. While Oculus and Vive non-pro feel like neat introductions, this Vive Pro shows us why we should have VR. It simply is night and day better.Oculus screen has a grey hazed and is no where near as bright, while the Vive Original SDE is simply strikingly pronounced. Oculus SDE is more muted due to an almost softening effect compared to Vive Original, with the Vive Pro eclipsing both.I have all three and is now difficult to use either Oculus or Vive Original. You can see so much more detail in every scene. Robinson the Journey is amazing, Skyrim is so detailed (especially with texture mods) and playing Pavlov gives you so much better range of shots and environmental detail. You also can see how dev's ""cheated"" with low resolution devices such as with the game Onward.In the end, there isn't anything wrong with Oculus and Vive Original. I loved them. Vive Pro is the natural evolution. It is prohibitively expensive, yes. There isn't any way around this. And it is only for those early adopter and enthusiast crows right now. It is also great to continue to use the Oculus Rift and Original Vive without consequence as they will continue to be relevant for at least 3 more years, as we are not even in the ""Gen 2"" age yet, with Vive Pro being more like PS4 Pro or Xbox One X, not yet true 4K or ""Next Gen"".YMMV

When considering spending a couple hundred on entertainment, you really want to have the best experience. You want a device that works well, and once it is up, you have a lot of content.The HTC Vive delivers across the board on this front.The device isn’t perfect, but it is probably the best commercial VR we’ve ever had. Relying on the Steam platform, Vive manages to make the barrier of entry for developers little more than a normal development process. This has created a lot of cool experiences that likely won’t see much light elsewhere, like Drunkn Bar Fight (also on Rift) and Crazy Fishing. Both are in either beta or alpha, but they are super mature in their development, and presented great experiences.All of that is a preface, since I will be critical of a few aspects of Vive.The setup is a monstrous joke. It took me about 5 days of finagling with settings, unpairing, repairing, and buying cables. It was an utter nightmare because the device has minimal support from Steam/HTC, and Google will bring up all the issues they had at launch with little resolution.For example, I have a GTX 1080 video card that has one HDMI port, 3 DisplayPorts, and 1 DVI port. My HDMI goes to a surround sound/TV, since I wanted a lot of room for VR. Unfortunately, the Vive’s LinkBox has an HDMI port, a mini-DisplayPort, a USB port, and a power port. Power and USB are fine, but with the Vive taking my HDMI, I had to buy a DP to HDMI converter. Unfortunately, that’s not an easy step as you have to ensure you buy the right one, to get the best output.After some trial and error, I settled on this cable - a miniDP to DP 4K cable (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C7RIL3C/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). This worked perfectly on the first try, with my TV functioning as it should. THe level of difficulty to get it flawlessly displaying was frustrating.Next, the Vive is still very immature hardware, while probably being the best on the market. The controllers often have to be plugged into your computer, powered on, and then disconnected to sync. This has been happening since release. The headset will lose tracking. Firmware updates won’t apply, and you’ll repeatedly get notifications to update your firmware on your devices.Basically, with the amount of hardware you need to provide and the cost of the product, I expected a lot of these issues to be resolved.All that said, it’s still worth buying.I’d recommend a high-end video card like the GTX 1080. It’s expensive, but it is basically giving you a few years without having to worry about messing with your computer. I have an AMD A10 processor, which works fine. The games are really high quality, though there isn’t a lot of diversity right now. Most games are some form of wave shooter, escape room, or something close. The ones that are outside of these genres tend to be the great exceptions. Games will come though, and triple A titles are getting VR support.The HTC Vive is really a game changer.

So, to make this clear first off, I got mine from Newegg, not Amazon. Newegg offered a faster option for me is all.Setup was a pain, mostly mounting the IR lighthouses. But once those were up, calibration and getting into games was a breeze. My room is JUST big enough to support RoomScale, which is imo the intended and best way to play games on the Vive.This is a FANTASTIC piece of hardware. Despite what most people seem to say, it's INCREDIBLY robust and not prone to taking much damage, even when being abused. However, it may be worth your $50 to buy some silicon covers for everything ($50 is STEEP for covers, but think about the $800 headset you're protecting!).The software always works great for me. SteamVR is very reliable at recognizing the hardware, offering firmware updates, and, using ReVive, is a useful tool for emulating Oculus CV1 games in SteamVR and even supporting non-VR games at times.There is, however, one tremendous flaw with the Vive, and PC VR headsets in general: NO SUBSTANTIAL GAMES! As we're incredibly early in this technology's commercial life cycle, most of the content out there right now is effectively tech demos. All of the developers right there, be they indie or AAA, want to charge you $30-$70 for absolutely rudimentary tech demos that you will be done with after maybe an hour or two of play - they surely figure this is okay, because obviously, if you paid $800 for a peripheral, you can afford $30 for some shallow games?To anyone who either can't EASILY afford a Vive right now, or isn't interested in developing for it: Stay away from VR for at least another one or two iterations of the technology. When the Vive 3 and CV3 are out, the games industry will probably have figured out their shit and gotten some real games out there for us - not to mention, the hardware will be exponentially cheaper. But for now, unless you're a diehard enthusiast who wants in on the early history of VR, avoid.

I have owned a vive for 6 months now.  First things first, make sure your pc can handle vr before you take the jump.My system at the time of purchase, was an AMD fx 8350, paired with two R9 290x gpus.  One 290 will handle most VR titles at an entry level.  With that said, without a usb 3.0 port, you will have issues with controllers syncing, and the camera on the vive.Now realize this, you are only seeing 1080p per eye.  Pixel count is low, so there is a ""screen door"" effect.  I highly suggest a very good gpu, a GTX 1070 or higher, because of a feature called Super Sampling.  You can render a higher resolution which will in turn created smoother lines with text and edges, and make things look much clearer.  If you have the basic requirements like I do, a 290x, you won't be able to turn up the sampling rate much, and in turn may not sustain a solid 90 fps in your headset which will turn on reprojection (cutting frames to 45 and doubling the image)Bottom line, if you have a good system, some cash to burn, and a large enough room to enjoy room scale, go for it.  You will be very pleased.  I play alot of Racing titles and flying simulators.  It really helps immersion and lap times.I suggest installing steam on your pc, and download the vr test to see if your system can handle it before dropping serious cash on a VR headset.Also, I HIGHLY recommend three legged light camera stands to mount your lightboxes to.  I didn't want to drill into my walls to mount them, so I purchased adjustable stands for them.  This way I can move them from room to room.  When I want to play roomscale games, i'll move my pc into my living room, and move them back when I play seated racing titles.As of april, 2017, if you haven't bought a vive, or oculus, and want to go vr, WAIT.  New gpus are around the corner, and higher resolution displays are coming in the next year.  Personally, I wish I waited for something better, 2k/4k displays, but my plan is to sell my vive once a better HMD is released.

Broke immediately and then while under warranty HTC made consumer pay for return shipping and again sent defective.  My neighbor Charlie Gibson has been updating me on the difficulties with this company for months.  Recently she showed me the new replacement she had received from HTC which while well padded was in pieces.  The third time they had sent her a defective replacement.  Avoid this companies products or buy a third party warranty.  How disappointing.

The system is incredibly cool when it works. The problem is that it doesn't work for very long.My first was fine for two weeks. Then the display burned out. I returned it for a new one. That worked for a month--just long enough to be out of return territory--and then broke.HTC customer service is horrible. It's chat only. You can't speak to a manager. They freely admit they can't do anything but get you a repair ticket. And you have to pay shipping, which is obnoxious. But what choice is there? I sent it in. They returned it a few weeks later.It worked for six days... and then broke again.Three total failures on two separate headsets in three months is not okay.Read through the other one star reviews--I wish I had--and you'll see my experience is pretty common.

Running HTC on a PC I built in 2013.  I have since upgraded my RAM to 32gb, SSD drives, and a GTX 980 about 2 years ago.  I can run most games with extreme graphic settings or highest available, perfectly fine.  Some games with super sampling slider to change, can’t go passed 1.4 or 2.0. That’s ok as I know my CPU and GPU may need upgrading.  If you do encounter stuttering get ready to feel dizzy for a few minutes or hours.  CONS; controllers are extremely sensitive, if you drop them, the track pad will break, this has already happened to me and got an exchange.  I purchased protective covers for the controllers since.  Screen door affect, it’s there but it can be ignored, that is the technology and not HTC.  Oculus has the same issue, but not so much on the PSVR.  Cables are very annoying, all games I have played are standing, there are really no game titles I know of where you can sit, get ready to stand for as long as you play.  Need to unmount base stations to update firmware, I have mine 6.5 feet up on my walls.  Headset is pretty heavy, I highly recommend the deluxe audio strap.  Be sure to purchase additional foam inserts if you sweat and share your system with someone else.  The wide face inserts are much more comfortable for me.

The Vive has not always been a smooth experience for me. I had to return a sensor for repair/replacement. I've had countless issues with tracking and latency. I've had to trouble shoot and Tinker... And I'm still giving it 5 stars.The Vive is one of two (three if you count the PSVR) virtual reality headsets that takes what was just a concept a few short years ago into the hands of consumers world wide. While many still expect VR to fail, those who give this new tech time to mature understand why it is so revolutionary. When experiencing high quality VR, like the Vive and the Rift and how good it already is, you soon release that it can, and will, get better.Presence is key and the Vive is constantly finding new ways to deliver that. Room scale is just the beginning. The Vive is built to grow. Most importantly is the fact that it is co-developed with Steam. This open source platform allows indie developers to maximize this technology.Not just for gamers... My wife does not like playing games. There are so many ""experiences"" that stretch far beyond just gaming. There's story telling, movies, simple games, advanced games, social experiences, new ways to explore and learn. Google Earth on the Vive is one example of ways you can travel and explore and discover things you never knew. This is not a replacement for hopping on a plane and seeing places first hand, rather a supplement as it's nearly impossible to travel to every corner of this massive earth.If you're on the fence and this review is going to help you make that decision, let me say this... I've begun nitpicking my budget and cutting things that are unnecessary. Trying to gain financial independence [mrmoneymustace.com]. With that said, I would buy this over and over.As pc components get better and less expensive (Nvidia and AMD!), VR gets closer and closer to mainstream (don't hate on Playstation... Whether you think they have something legitimate to offer or not, their success helps further the growth of VR as a whole). NOW is the time to invest your hard earned money into something that will deliver breathtaking, high end VR experiences for years.

UPDATE: I am coming up on a year of owning the Vive.  I got pretty busy for a few months and didn't touch it. When I finally did, it felt like a new experience all over. The Steam HomeVR addition is really cool and I am also pretty excited to buy the knuckles when they come out. Since my original purchase, I have built a new computer with traveling in mind. I also picked up two 10' metal stands off Amazon which work great when bringing the Vive places.  Everything except for the two stands fit in my carry on luggage so bringing it places is pretty simple.Looking back it was probably a bad move on my part to drop $800 on the Vive when I don't even play computer games that much anymore but I am glad I did and get to experience the evolution of the device.I am hoping the $200 price drop encourages more people to buy it so I have someone to play ping pong against for once.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Even though I didn't purchase my Vive from Amazon, I feel like I should leave my review here as well since I always make use of Amazon reviews before making a purchase...I originally wrote up this long review but feel that it isn't needed when talking about the Vive.  Honestly, the best thing you can do while contemplating ordering a Vive is to go to the Microsoft Store and request a demonstration.  I followed VR since the Oculus Rift was announced and even more so when the Vive was announced.  I knew I wanted a Vive based on what everyone was saying but the price tag is daunting.Once I tried the Vive at the Microsoft Store in the mall near me, I took off work a few days later and picked one up from Microcenter during the first week of October.  It is now halfway through December and I think I have played it nearly every day.  It has rekindled my old love for PC gaming that has been missing due to work, depression and life.I knew it would be awesome after all the hype but even the hype didn't do it justice.

This product is mind blowing... it's hard to explain what it's like to use it until you have the headset on, and you're wondering where your arms and torso went. Looking at the controllers reacting to your hands is completely surreal - the movement appears to be perfect once you set your lighthouses up correctly (I recommend using the lighthouse sync cable for the best experience possible. Without it everything works, but I had trouble with stuttering every so often, which really disrupts the whole experience.) Oh, and if you have a 980ti or lower, don't exceed 1080p 60fps on your monitor - I *think* UHD @ 144hz was causing me problems (zero issues after moving to 1080 when using the Vive.)When you get a good game that has high ratings on steam, you're instantly transported to an entirely different world. It's a completely bizarre experience, but the games are almost all universally intuitive (be sure to get games with a ""very positive"", or ""overwhelmingly positive"" rating - this is easy to do, i have around 20-30 of them now after only a month with this product - these all collectively set me back around $100.) There are a few high rated games that are incredibly fun, and 100% free as well (e.g. ""The Lab"", ""Accounting"", ""Google Earth VR""). Most games I've found that are worthwhile aren't too expensive, you'll drop an average of 15-20 dollars on them (although there are exceptions.)Oh, and as for the two games that came with my purchase (this may change in the future), ""The Gallery"" is absolutely incredible - it's the most immersive experience I've had with the Vive so far. Zombie Training Simulator on the other hand is pretty weak (although that's just my opinion, others appear to like it based on the reviews.)

I pre-ordered this from HTC and received it in the beginning of May. Here we are five months later, and I still think it was totally worth it. My family loves it. We don't pull it out every single day like we used to, but still often enough to be worth it. And it's wonderful to introduce new people to it. Those first hours in the Vive are something to see!Something to keep in mind is that this technology is young. There are not copious amounts of high quality, long, games. But there are several really amazing ones. And when you can share an environment with others, it's pretty darn cool! We now have over 40 Vive games on the computer. I probably should go back and revisit several of them. The Lab is still one of the favorites and a first game that we pull out with all new folks. Not to be missed!One of my favorite things now though, is to step into a world that I have created in 3D. I'll work in Blender and Unity and then can go look at something full sized and it is just so real!VR is going to be big. Like, really big. I am delighted to be at the beginning of this.

First off, the Vive is a pretty cool experience. In many ways I love the immersiveness and intuitiveness. But it's by no means worth $600 right now. The resolution is simply too low, things are blurry and set up is always finicky. Compatibility is iffy, lots of problems still crop up. Only enthusiasts are willing to deal with all the little issues right now. Right now there's too little game development, very little full, AAA game experiences because there are too few people buying VR. Fallout 4 is neat for a bit, but it feels gimmicky due to that it wasn't designed for VR.As far as the Vive, I'd go with the Oculus or other options, they're simply much more reasonable at half the price and nearly the same experience.But....customer service...HTC's customer service is straight from hell. First off, they take 1-2 weeks to respond (if at all). One of my vive controllers has a loose part, and I asked what they could do to help me out. They really try to pinch pennies and care very little about customer loyalty. Come on, I have invested almost $1000 into their company. You think they'd be willing to send me a replacement controller with no questions asked. Instead they wanted me to return my device first, and wait 3-4 weeks for repair.I spoke with like 5 different reps, all giving me different info, false promises, and slow responses. They all seem to not have a very good handle on clear English communication either. Extremely frustrating and I still have been given no reasonable option to solve my issue. For paying for a uber-premium product, I expect premium customer service..

This is one of those things you cannot explain to people, but must experience yourself to judge, it's like me trying to explain being in love. You wouldn't understand unless you have been in love. Then all of a sudden the stupid things people do while in love begins to make sense. I digress.I tried the OCULUS RIFT as well, doesn't compare due top lack of tracked controllers and not being able to walk around. The Vive is convincing. Handing an acorn to a small goblin and seeing him look at you, walk up to you and talk the acorn from your hand felt so real.The controllers on the vive track your hand 100%. The sense of scale is realistic. That is why I cannot do anything horror, because now you can actually see that the monster is far bigger than you. Being able to move physically makes everything so much more enjoyable and tangible. I recently tried the Apollo11 space mission documentary, tried Google Earth, simply amazing, not just for gamers. If you are thinking of buying a 60 inch T.V. forget about it, buy this instead because in Cinema VR that I just recently tried, it felt no different than being in a real movie theater. I'm being honest. The movie theater screen size was exactly the same in this headset. It's gigantic. You have to try it to believe it. Don't cheap out on a good computer to try this, but it will run on  GTX 970 and even an old i7 like I had (i7-920). Some games wont run smoothly that's all or you may have to turn down the graphical settings. But most did work well.. However, I did upgrade my PC, because I wanted more after seeing what true VR can do.

This thing seriously was a pain to setup in my case; much more than it should have been (was apart of the ""Wave 2"" crowd that got theirs in May) things will inevitably crash, it's possible it might be hardware related (in my case and HDMI cable shorted) but despite all that I would still give this thing 10* and the reason: I can guarantee you have never tried a piece of technology as unique as the Vive. When it's working it's borderline magical; pounds will melt as you forget you're vigorously exercising dodging missiles in Holopoint or diving on your floor playing Hover Junkers and your heartbeat will race in Onward when you finally line up that headshot only to forget you're using an LMG and forgot to manually load the belt and physically cock the gun to load a bullet in the chamber. The headset will get uncomfortably sweaty, the stock earbuds suck balls and whatever headphones you use will inevitably start digging into your head (please use headphones it adds to the experience greatly) you will constantly smack your walls and trip on your cord but again you won't give a flying fart because you're having the time of your life and never want it to stop. I am proud to say that I will lose my job once a VRMMO game comes out if it's anything like FFXIV:ARR or Wow it will capitulate the ""video game addict"" stigma to a whole new level.

Had one since April. I can't recommend this for everyone due to its price and being a first generation product. But if you are a VR enthusiast or must have the most advanced multimedia/gaming device it is really amazing. Setup and troubleshooting are a bit rough but for PC gamers, which have systems powerful enough to run it, it is not too hard and well worth the tinkering needed to get it running. I found the resolution and field of view to be good and not detract too much from the immersion. The tether is a bit annoying but you get used to it.While this can do seated VR, its main feature is room scale. This allows you to walk around VR rooms and game environments. You also have 2 tracked controllers that are insanely accurate. The combination of the two creates a strong sense of presence in another world. There are grids that pop up and an optional camera that can show you the room for safety to avoid leaving your play area. I have 3 x 3 meters of space. You will definitely want as much space as you can spare.Steam has a great selection of free and paid games, 700+ as of writing this. I find the best games are roomscale ones as they are often the most enjoyable and lack any motion sickness for me. Most of the games are arcade like and lack the depth and content of large big budget games. But they are still great. We should be getting a VR version of Fallout 4 and a big Valve game in 2017. In addition to games, there are non-game applications like tilt brush and virtual theaters. It is more than just a gaming device and more of a new way to interact with computers.I'd normally rate it lower for minor quirks and troubleshooting but overall, it is a good first generation product that hit on everything needed for an early holodeck-like experience. It is really mind blowing.

If your set works with no issues then you are good to go.  If you are sent defective merchandise, be prepared for frustration.  You must ship it back to HTC at your expense(even if it breaks in less than 30 days) and wait potentially for months to get your hardware repaired.  They may fail to repair your hardware and send it back to you still broken.  They may claim that your sweat is water damage and you have to pay.Evidently, HTC is a company that does not stand behind their products.  They want the consumer to pay for their shoddy and often defective merchandise.  I guess they feel they have the market cornered.  They have a lot of exclusives.  There are also mods(shills?) that take down customer service complaints on Reddit, hiding what appears to be a significant issue.p.s., If you love the tech and you haven't had problems, then be thankful.  A lot of us weren't so lucky.

I recently purchased the Vive Pro HMD VR and am extremely impressed with this headset. I did read lots of reviews where people were questioning the quality, integration, and software for this headset. I decided I wanted the 78% increase graphics and would take a chance for that reason alone..even though they cost a great deal more than other VR headsets. The quality of the Headset is excellent, the hardware/software integration is simple and easy to use with both the Steam API and VIVEPORT. I fly a lot of flight simulators, X-Plane 11 and Aerofly FS2, along with many other VR ready games. The reality that comes alive with this VR headset is hard to describe. My son-in-law was pouring sweat and got sick flying a Blackhawk helicopter using the VIVE PRO VR HS. The experience is incredible. I highly recommend the VIVE PRO VR to all my friends.

(Purchased for 799 at the local mall in the Microsoft store.)You should check the HTC VIVE web-page for locations near you that offer demo's because it is impossible to truly know how awesome this technology is without trying it yourself.. If you live in the US, you should have at least one location within a 3 hour drive that offers demo's I would think.. and yes, if you make a road-trip out of it, it is worth going to try it out before you plunk down the money!The HTC Vive is amazing, just make sure you have a powerful graphics card to run it. You can install Steam's free test to see if your system is fast enough BEFORE you make any purchases. Just search for ""SteamVR Performance Test"" to find and install the test.The room-scale is THE killer feature of the HTC Vive, it is mindblowingly cool, and I could not imagine VR without room-scale!I also like that it is easy to find compatible games and that many games and experiences are free! As such, make sure you have at least a 4-5 feet square or at least a 4-5 feet wide by x long rectangle available. Generally the bigger the better!My personal favorite game is the Space Pirate Trainer game, but there are so many good and great games! Expect to spend $ to $$$ on extra games as you go.A note on the 'minimum requirements' that I've seen: My CPU is over 5 years old and way under the 'minimum' specifications, but in my experience this has not been a problem in any game so far. It appears to me, that THE most important part is to get as much graphics power as you possibly can! I got extremely lucky and picked up a brand new Sapphire Fury Trixx card for $299 (they normally retail in the $500+ range), and that may be a big reason why my old CPU is up to snuff.

First, it's a lot of fun, and a great toy when it works.Unfortunately, after recieving it 11/7, it stopped working 11/27.  Vive has no customer support number on it's site.  They have chat or e-mail.  On chat, the responses (even simple ones) take a minimum of 2 minutes (I have time stamps), and you can expect to spend 30 minutes to get nothing done.Once there, you will find that for 14 days, you can return the product, after that it has to be returned at your expense for repair.  How long's that going to take?  I still don't know.If you ask to have the problem escalated, you will be told you will be called within 2 days.  When that fails, and you recontact through chat, you will be told 5 days, then it will be corrected to 4 business days.  I'm still waiting to see if either is correct.At this price, they should have reasonable support.  If I purchased a Playstation VR, I would have a new one in my hands right now.It's a gamble.  If you want to risk $800 on a potentially non-functioning system, click buy it now.  If you want a system that works, look elsewhere.Just found out, it's a small sticker that's in the controller which moves and stops the button from working.

Please NOTE that many or most of the reviews thus far are carried over from a prior listing which was from a third party that was price gouging on the early release units.  The current listing is a proper listing at the correct retail price (currently $799).  Please consider just reviews of the device itself and ignore all talk about ""don't buy from this vendor"" etc as it is no longer relevant.The Vive is awesome for a first generation VR experience.  However, you need to understand that it is a FIRST GENERATION experience.  It has many flaws that someday will look comical in hindsight.  But even still, the overall experience is great, novel, unique, fun, and genuinely mind blowing.  A major limitation at the moment is that most experiences are both overpriced and under-achieving, in that they tend to be short, with even the best experiences lasting only hours.  I have found that most titles have limited replayability as well.However, if you want to be on the forefront of VR, if you want to take a step into the future of entertainment and get a feeling for where we are heading, the Vive is, in my opinion, the best device you can buy at the moment and well worth the price.

Overall I am happy, but not in ecstasies:PROS:- Love room scale. Can not imagine playing sitting. Moving around and evading bullets in great- The 3D effect is real. Like the games you experience in Disney or UniversalNEUTRAL:- Game selection is better than Expected, which was a big concern to me after reading some reviews.CONS:- the biggest con is the quality of the image, and the reason why I won't give it a 5 start. There is a bit of fuzzy image, speciality in the perimeter. And I am not too picky. The image quality is somewhere between a PlayStation 2 and a PlayStation 3. By the way, I have a high end computer and have setting in 'ultra' but image is not too sharp anyhow.- not a big deal, but the headset is not super confortable. It is ok but after 1:30hs you need a break- not a big deal, but sometimes you have to be careful not to tangle your feet with the cables.- I do tend to get motion sick slightly at some points in the game, specially if playing for too long, but nothing that would desuade me from using it.In summery, a great piece of technology. If it was not for the somewhat poor quality of the image, i would say it is the best electronic ever created, but the fussy image is an annoyance.

This product is absolutely fantastic.  There is only one thing I hate about it (get this out of the way first) and that is the spongy foam pad.  It absorbs sweat and whatever else and makes the headset uncomfortable.  And if you are switching between people...it's like putting on someone else's damp sweaty bike helmet.  The foam was the first thing to go. Plenty of replacement products out there.I chose the VIVE over the RIFT because it came ready to go, all accessories, out of the box.  Set up is relatively quick, depending on how you choose to mount the tracking cameras.Despite the minimum requirements, the VIVE ran fine on my GTX770, I7 4770, 16G rig.  I have played many of the demos, but I use it primarily for Elite Dangerous and it is perfection (not the game-the vive)  I've worn the VIVE for hours (after replacing the foam).  The had controllers feel great and everything tracks well.I just hope future versions come with an upgrade to the head straps.  The elastic velcro combo works okay, but you ever try the PSVR you'll see a higher quality head strap.All in all, great product, a growing media lineup and very immersive, both standing and sitting.  highly recommended.

After an unpleasant realization, I can no longer recommend this product.I enjoyed the time I've had using the Vive when it was still working, but 10 months into use, one of the base stations began blinking with a red light, as outlined in one of the uploaded images. I figured I was out of luck, until I realized recently, a week or so before the writing of this review, that the Vive had a 12-month warranty. HTC was happy to repair the base station for free, plus the cost of shipping the base station to them.Four days after the warranty of my Vive system expired, while my first base station was sent in for repair, the second base station showed the same axis failure and blinking red light. They said it would cost $90 plus shipping to have it repaired, and that it would have a 12-month warranty when it was returned. Alternatively, they recommended buying a new base station for $139, or a refurbished one for $119, both of which come with a 12-month warranty.From this, I've concluded that the base stations are meant to last 1 year, or 12 months.I write this review with the intention of warning others about this issue, as I sit here with a Vive that cannot function until the first base station returns from repair. I do not intend to spend a potential $200+ per year to use a device that costs more than twice that, and I no longer plan to buy from HTC until these issues can be remedied in future devices.

I have been using the HTC Vive on a near daily basis for the past 3 months. Here are some of my thoughts on it.1. Easy to set up.Many reviews, on Amazon and on tech sites seem to focus on how hard it is to set up the Vive, planning for base stations etc. I found it very simple. I followed the instructions, plugged everything into the right sockets, and boom, I was in VR. The most annoying thing was waiting for the vr software and then games to download. Honestly, if you can set up a DVD player you should be able to cope with the Vive. There is some forethought required. Make sure you have space, for me its 2m x 2m (6.5 feet x 6.5 feet) and I think this should be the bare minimum, it's a bit cramped, but bearable. Think about where you'll put your base stations. I use light stands which work wonderfully. I've read that contractor poles are another good option. They'll have to be at 2 opposite corners of the room, so make sure you've got plug points, if not, get extension cords. Make sure you have a free HDMI port on your graphics card. I use display ports for my monitors so it's not a problem for me but I can see how some might find this irritating. I had given these details some thought before my purchase and once I opened the box, setting up the Vive was seamless.2. The experience is awesomeI will never forget the first time I put on my Vive. The world vanished and suddenly I was somewhere else. I was in my room but in another world. Like being inside a painting or book made three dimensional. It was incredible. My first game was space pirate trainer, I didn't want to take the headset off. Removing it actually felt a bit jarring. I was back in my drab, fairly underwhelming room. If I didn't have work and other things to do I would spend a great deal more time in VR. Now the cons, the graphics are underwhelming, stuff looks pixelated, if you're expecting full HD looking stuff, you're not going to get it. But honestly, I don't care, once you sink into the experience, the graphics can be overlooked. The games aren't that developed yet, there isn't all that much to do. Also space is a limiting factor. You might be in a breathtaking new world, but you're still inside a 2 by 2 box, take 2 steps in any one direction and you're hitting a wall.Over the past three months, I have come to rely on the Vive as a replacement gym. My default game, steam tells me I've spent about 60 hours in it, is called Audioshield. Best go to youtube and see a video of it. The vanilla game becomes easy fast, but there are mods. One is called the Rhythm+Workout Mod. I workout using this almost everyday. My fitbit charge 2 tells me my average heartrate is between 150-160, generally peaking at about 175, and I burn about 350-400 calories per session. It's really quite intense. I used to be very sendentary. I would spend all day working, sitting down, then play video games or watch TV, also sitting down. Now it's like I'm an action hero, leaping about dodging virtual arrows and shadow boxing to my favourite music. I overdid it the first few weeks. My feet blistered, I developed stabbing pains in my knees and then later on in my upper back. A moratorium and then gradually easing myself back in fixed all this. No pains now and I go all out! But really, you lose yourself and then don't realise how much time has passed while you're exercising. If you're like me and aren't that fit when you start, take it easy. Now though I find that 40-50 minutes of non stop vigorous exercise in this and I'm tired. I have to take it off.3. Things to note:The cable. Yes, you've got a cable trailing down your back. At first its a bummer. But after a few days, it feels like the new normal. There are some games, like Holopoint, (the archery/arrow dodging game) which would really benefit from wireless. It requires 360 degree freedom. But you get used to working around the cable really fast, I think I got tangled up once, but after that it's like your brain instinctively knows where the cable is without you having to think about it and it's not that big a deal. There are a few bugs that cropped up. Once there were bluetooth driver errors with the base stations and they needed to be manually shut down and turned on. There's a setting that supposed to let them start up when you turn the headset on and shut down when you quit VR. It took a bit of fiddling to fix this. Then the haptic feedback on one of the controllers stopped working, I restarted the headset and it started back up again. Everytime there's a windows update, the audio settings that send the audio to the headset when VR is on and back to my headphones when I quit get reset. But these are small things and don't really bother me. (The haptic feedback being disabled threw me though, the whole VR system needed a reset to fix) They might bother some people more than others.The default headset strap is a bit irritating. HTC sells a deluxe version that I bought and is much better. But really, I spent about 800 USD on this fancy VR system (it's more expensive outside the U.S) and then I have to buy extras? Not cool HTC. You really should have packed the so called deluxe strap in with the default package. The supplied earbuds suck. Really. They are so bad I don't know why they're in the box. HTC sells the most cutting edge virtual reality set and then supplies earbuds that even a budget airline would reject. The deluxe audio add on is really nice though.Another thing to note is the sweat. To prevent it from getting inside the Vive I use a sweat band, and you get these cloth covers for the foam that hugs the headset to your face. Note, the foam when it comes into contact with sweat leaves grey smudges all over your face. The cloth protection is pretty much a default requirement. This needs an out of the box solution, perhaps a reworked cover and waterproofing HTC?4. Conclusion:If you like the idea of VR, can afford it, and your computer can run it. Buy it. HTC has launched a new Vive, an iterative update so you might want to wait for that to come out in stores.

My first experience getting into Virtual Reality with these systems was about a year and a half ago, and i will share some of my thoughts to help you all decide on the Vive Pro, which i love and don't think i could live without at this point. :) A brief history: I tried the Oculus Rift first, and being a glasses-wearer got my nose bridge sore and cut every time i spent a few hours playing.  If you don't wear glasses, or if you have a very thin frame, it may not be an issue, and the Rift is integrated with Facebook (who owns Oculus), so if you use that service you may find the Rift better for you.  They now have the Rift S out, which supposedly has graphics upgraded to be on par with Vive Pro, but i cannot comment since i have not tried it yet.  I believe it is the same tight fitting design however.Next i bought the Vive system, and was able to use it with my glasses without problem.  The Vive has straps that as another reviewer mentioned, take some experimenting to get the headset to hang right on your head.  It is front heavy and tricky to get placed right.  The Vive Pro has solved that issue entirely by building a complete frame for the display, headphones, and includes a rear adjuster for the semi rigid headband.  But this issue of fit will not justify the over double price of the Pro, and the standard is very good and if you are new to VR, i recommend the set for less than $500 to be up and running.  The basic Vive set has not just the headset, but the 2 controllers and 2 sensors you need to make the VR system work.  The two included sensors with Vive are better than what come with the Rift system that sells for around $400, since Rift needs a third sensor for room-scale tracking that is an extra $60.  If you plan on doing only seated VR apps like i mostly do, this may not be an issue.Ok, now the reason to buy this Vive Pro besides the good headset fit:  it is just awesome graphic wise and sound wise compared to the other two systems.  I play DCS World and Elite:Dangerous and with the higher resolution, you can read aircraft gauges and see everything including backgrounds much clearer, and you have a greatly reduced ""screen door effect""--the fact that you can see in between the pixels on the standard headsets due to there being less of them, and each one larger.  In Pro, you have more pixels per inch (ppi) and that gives the sharper resolution.  The electronic hardware itself is better too, although i don't know the specifics, you can find those on Vive's website.  The headset is so comfortable for my seated flight simulation that i can easily spend several hours with a few breaks and cannot wait to go back under the hood.  I liken it to the movie ""Matrix,"" and this Pro is about as close as we can come now to being plugged into it.That said, spending $1400 for the complete Pro setup is NOT recommended if you have not tried VR yet.  There is a progression to immersion i used, and it might be helpful to share.  I used something called Track IR for years to allow a game to respond to you turning your head or leaning in to read something, and that was the most awesome thing to bring the sense that you were really in the cockpit and able to dogfight by looking all around you instead of messing with hat switches or keyboards.  The Track IR system can be had for around $150 and is a huge step for anyone still staring a a single screen, or even if you have 3 screens set up, having the ability to move your head and see around you gives a sense of virtual reality.  It provides the 6 degrees of freedom just like these VR systems, but of course in 2 dimensions only.If you've already done that, and want to move up to the most amazing tech ever created, get one of the entry level VR systems and enjoy it for $400 or $500 with all things included.  If you buy a Vive standard or the Oculus Rift, it is a thousand times more real than Track IR, because now you have three dimensions where you can sense depth on a landing, you can see the dimensions of the cockpit panel, you can see your virtual body sitting in the seat, you can see your virtual arms and hands in front of you with your real head seemingly connected to that.  The first time i booted up DCS World and was at the config screen, and i was sitting in a virtual hangar with the wing of a MiG 29 over my head and the jet parked towering next to me, i nearly fainted and had tears come to my eyes.  I did not notice any screen door effect or lack of resolution at that point...it was only WOW THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.  And the first time spawning in the Mustang already in the air, i can only say, you need to see and feel it to believe it.  I fly for real, and i swear it IS that good.  You move your head like you would in a real airplane, and everything tells you that you are really there.  Go to do the approach and landing, and you suddenly notice that you can gauge tree height like you would in a real plane, and you can judge your flare and landing using 3d cues that are impossible to rely on using a flat screen or standard head tracking.After a while using either entry level VR system, you may decide either it is just a fancy toy, or you may say you are completely addicted.  If you fall into this latter case like i do, and if you really need to be able to see things like precise dial readings on an airplane panel, then you need to pony up the money to buy the Vive Pro and you will see what you were missing.  I bought the Vive Pro headset only (not with the 2nd gen room sensors or wands) and it works perfectly with the existing sensors and wands that came with the Vive standard.  In fact, i see that they now sell the Vive Pro with the 1st gen sensors and wands for around $1050, so unless you want the 20x20 room-scale play room ability, stick with the 1st gen components to go with the Vive Pro head mounted display.I hope this was helpful for understanding just how great this product is, but that it is not necessary for everyone.

This headset is amazing, with an MSRP of 800 USD (recently lowered to 500 USD) it isn't a cheap peripheral and it requires a slightly beefy PC. It isn't perfect, but it's a very good start.Pros:The room scale tracking with the headset and controllers is very accurate.The immersion you experience can be so good, it becomes disorienting when you stop playing.This headset is backed by Valve and HTC VR has branched off from HTC (the latter is a failing company)No hardware DRM issues preventing an upgrade to a better headset, when availableThe controllers are comfortable and intuitiveThe headset fits tightly to prevent light ingress from reaching your eyesTONS of free and cheap VR softwareIR tracking, instead of camera tracking means you don't need USB 3.0 ports for each sensorCons:Not affordable for most and requires a beefy gaming PCSome games require 2m x 2m of open space which not everyone has room forThe headset traps air inside and gets very warm as a result, causing the foam padding to get soaked in sweatThe controller wrist straps are poorly designed. Don't rely on them to save your controller from going flying if you let go. Aftermarket straps are a good purchase.Setup can feel daunting (thankfully, it is typically a 1-time thing)Overall:If you have the PC to handle it and want to experience the best VR on the market, give this a go. The games library is still small but rapidly growing and exciting.

Honestly so much fun.  I don't really like playing normal computer games anymore but it's so nice to play some VR occasionally and relax.  As with any new product there are some cons,  things im sure will be addressed in next genCons-Wires-would be more immersive with fewer wires or even wireless head mounted display if possibleRoom setup- once you plug in the sensors you got to run a room setup,  the better you set it up the better your experience.  Would be nice to have a quicker room setup option,  it can take some effort to get it rightWeight-the headmounted piece could be lighter and smaller,  while keeping the same features, that would be really nice.Protection-some padded gaurds for the outer part of the controlers would be nice,  ive slapped a few my friends and my walls a bunch of times so far lol,  not sure if it would be okay with the sensorsDisplay-if you focus in you can see the screen door effect and some areas are clearer than others.  If i look straight down, the hmd is not secured enough and it shifts making me look at the blurry angle of hmd and ill have to hold it with my hands.  But honestly,  in most immersive games you dont even notice it,  only for games where youre in the mountains trying to look far into distance for example,  screen door can be noticableFinal comment:  the cons i listed by no mean make it a bad product,  you will have lots of fun with this given you play the right games and find the right apps.  This device is only limited by the content out there for it right now.  Rook scale vr is awsome,  so for now this trumps the oculus in my opinion.  If money is tight, id hold off.  But if your feeling good on money and are looking for a cool new toy, this wont dissapoint you.

This is the most amazing home entertainment technology available right now. Watching youtube videos and hearing other people describe it doesn't do it justice. It's almost like a 3D TV in that you have to see it for yourself to really understand what it does.The HTC Vive is one of the three ""Major"" VR systems available right now. The others are the Oculus Rift and the PlayStation VR. Without a doubt, the HTC Vive is the superior one, by far. The Rift is cheaper and slightly more comfortable on your face, but it doesn't include motion controllers or room-scale tracking, which lets you physically walk around the 3D world using your legs (these features will be available eventually when they release extra accessories for it, but it will be more expensive than the Vive, and the tracking technology will still be inferior). The Playstation VR is certainly the cheapest option by far because unlike the Rift and Vive, you don't need an expensive PC to use it; all you need is a Playstation 4. However, because it's cheapest it's also the lowest quality.I'm not even going to get into the dirty Facebook politics/advertising/privacy issues that plague the Rift, but know it ain't pretty.So if you want the best of the best, AND the greatest value, get the HTC Vive.

The box arrived 10/25.  Got to use it for a few weeks until a small plastic piece that the headstrap connects to chipped away and the strap wouldnt hold anymore.  Vive support said that they couldnt send this piece that is no bigger than a quarter and would take 5 minutes to swap, and instead insisted that i needed to send it in for repair (and pay for it).  Well, it was delivered on 12/5 and it must be sitting in a pile there because everytime I goto their chat support, they say something different.  Initially i was told 7-10 day turnaround, last time 14-20.  I wish i never sent it in as I could probably just 3d print this thing.  Anyway.  Its been at their repair shop for 15 days and still not a clue when I will get it back.

The potential for this VR system is really through the roof. We got it back in July and immediately purchased a ton of games for it on steam so we could try it out with family and friends. We've enjoyed it so far because it's so immersive. My favorite game is Tilt Brush as I'm an artist and it really gives me an opportunity to play around with a new medium. I use my skills as an artist in a whole new way.The installation process was fairly easy but after awhile one of my controllers wouldn't work with the system no matter what I did. I ended up finding out I needed to change the USB port to a USB 2 port instead of the USB 3 port it was in as it was causing the system to mess up. Either way it was a small issue.I've played games with swords, arrows, guns, etc. and everything feels so right in the moment. It can even be scary at times which is why it's so good that the controllers have straps to keep them on your arm if you scream out and release like I do.I highly recommend getting this!

I'm done with HTC and will seriously never buy another product from them. I got my controller back today from my third RMA and absolutely nothing was done with it. The exact same trigger issue persists, there is no way anybody even touched it or they would have noticed. My first RMA was at the beginning of September, and this series of two subsequent RMA's has lasted since the beginning of October. That is 4 months without a controller! I got my Vive at the end of May so have had it for 7 months, but over half of which it has been out of commission for what I bought it for (room-scale VR)! There aren't any words to express my frustration with this process. 3 RMA's, 5 shipment labels paid for by HTC, and the time to ""repair"" the product and HTC could have just shipped me a new controller for less money and hassle. During Christmas one of my friends was buying a computer and VR bundle for their kid and asked me about what to buy. I had them go with the Oculus Rift because I told them I've had too many issues with HTC and the Vive, and so they went with my recommendation. Because of the horrific customer support you've lost a minimum of one sale, and many of my friends and family members are interested in getting VR but I'll highly recommend them going with Oculus right now because I cannot trust HTC as a company... I do not feel valued as a customer and I do not feel that there is any quality control going on with their hardware. I'll probably just attempt to take the controller apart myself and see if I can fix the trigger, and then I'm going to sell it on ebay as soon as possible. Looks like I'll easily be able to dump it for $500-$600 and be able to start my fund for an Oculus Rift. (Ticket Number 16USCW41ENA000209 shows the chat log for the last 3 months).Bottom line the VR is great fun when it works, but the company treats it's customers like trash and doesn't stand behind their product at all. I'd highly recommend going with the Oculus Rift with Touch controller at this point in time.

I got it for my husband's birthday. I was about to buy oculus rift but best buy didn't have any in stock. And game stop talked me into buying vive. I don't regret. I can't really compare it to oculus cuz didn't play it.Set up of htc vive should take only 25 minutes according to set up wizard. It took us 4 hours... so i just want to warning you. Most of PCs come with only 1 HDMI port. I was already using that port to connect pc to flat screen tv. There is an option to use mini-display cable, which works just as great as HDMI. So plan ahead what cable you are using for what. And HDMI splitter (as my husband suggested) WILL NOT WORK. So just save your time, buy extra mini-display cable for about $10 and enjoy.PS. If you have kids, you may want to set up your HTC vive while they're at school so you will get a chance to play.

I purchased my Vive from a brick and mortar store in July. Had it been available on amazon then, I would have likely purchased it here.I have been a gamer for most of my life, but have been less involved since becoming a teacher. I knew that VR was in the early stages and that oculus was off to a rough start with their release. This was in July and I had stumbled across some videos of the Vive and details of what kind of experience to expect. I immediately bought in, feeling like my teenager self again pining for the bleeding edge of gaming again. So after asking a friend to talk me off of this cliff (unsuccessfully) I took the plunge and drove to the store.The Vive comes in an excellent package which keeps all of the peripherals secure. There are lots of component. The HMD (head unit) a break out box, and 3 wires to connect to said breakout box. Two light house scanners and their power cables with an optional sync cable. Two controllers and their power cables (with a wall brick for each) It was overwhelming but a fun project to put together. Set aside a weekend morning to get things set up right. You will need some space, imagine a floor area you can lay down across and roll once unobstructed. more area=more fun.Pro's:Excellent build qualitySoftware is easy to use and calibrateThe whole system is easy to maintainImmersive games are immersive.You will likely have the time of your life.Video quality is premium considering the state of technologyCon's:Most of the games available are not fully developed.A lot of the games are just a joke.Some great games have poor visual quality due to game engine deficiencies.Sometimes the unit loses tracking and that can have weird effects in game.you will likely need to upgrade your system.I had to upgrade my system from it's 2009 hardware. I was running a Phenom II 955, but at least I had a GTX 970. I upgraded to an Intel 6700K with 16G of ram for a total cost of $550. so the actual damage to the wallet was around $1350. As an enthusiast I was completely okay with this purchase and I do not regret it one bit. I find time in the evening to decompress with some Hot dogs, Horseshoes, and Hand grenades. :)

I had this for a few months when it worked fine, and it was OK.  Then the first lighthouse broke.  I sent it in for warranty, and before the first one got back, the second one broke (when I was out of town and it sat untouched).  They both broke with the same error, apparently a laser diode went bad (fault code 02 and 03, which are the same).  I had to pay to ship both items to them, and did.  They repaired the first one and sent it back, and the second one they claim to have not received.  Unfortunately I didn't get certified shipping, but USPS dropped this off with an individual - and given their address, and the instructions to drop it off at a dock, there is no way it went to the wrong address.  HTC is 'opening an investigation'.  My Vive has been unusable for several months now, almost half the time I've had it.The mask is fine, but I must have got a bad batch of lighthouses and it's irritating that it's going to cost me so much to get this back working.

If you already have the Vive, I do not recommend purchasing the Vive Pro. It is not sufficiently better than the original to justify the additional expense. If you are new to VR and want the best, and if the additional $800 is not important to you, then by all means buy this. It IS sharper than the original, and the headphones are nice (when they work correctly). It IS sharper than the Oculus. However, if I had it to do over again I would not purchase this model. The original Vive would have been fine until a true V.2 level of headset is released.

I love the Vive. I don't love HTC. It's a really fun device to play with friends, but God help you if you need to get any repairs.I bought the audio strap after owning it for a few months. Now, to put the strap on you have to take off the strap that comes with the product. The audio strap didn't really have great instructions on how to do this, so I used some videos online. Got the strap off, and a tiny piece of plastic fell out with it. Maybe a millimeter in total. The audiostrap would not fit into the buckle (that's what HTC calls this part that broke) with this little piece missing, and they said the only way to fix is to send into the repair shop.Ok, fine whatever. They told me 10 business days. I sent it in the 1st of February, and it was just radio silence on their part. No contact for a week, so I checked to see what was going on. They received the Vive at the dock. Awesome. (apparently the tracking website they tell you to use to track repairs is broken cause it was stuck on ""please send your device to our repair center"".  I ask them how long it will take to repair, and again I get the vague ""not too long. Usually 2-3 weeks!"". Ok so 10-15 business days. A little longer than I was previously told, but alright.Now at this point, I should say that the process is supposed to be that they diagnose the device, let you know how much it will cost, then go ahead with the repairs. I was two weeks into after they received the device (this was when they were supposed to be done) and still had zero communication about the device. It blows my mind that a piece of plastic falling off would take this long to even diagnose! I reached out, and was told the same thing. ""it's being looked at but unfortunately we haven't been able to get to it because of issues"".At this point I mentioned to them that I am moving mid-March and they need to get it back to me before then. Preferably repaired... He said he would expedite it. Ok we'll see.Flash forward to this week, a month after sending in, and they still haven't even begun the process. If I pay $600 for a device, then another $100 for the audiostrap, I'm giving a ton of money to a company that clearly doesn't give a damn about the customers. I'm tired of having to talk to another person ever week about the same ""delays and problems"". It's a piece of plastic. Just pop it out and put a new one in. It can't be that difficult. If this was a software issue, I would be more understanding.UPDATE 3/23/18: Still not repaired. They still are unsure of what process it's in. HTC is a joke and should be ashamed. Regret buying this.

I bought this through HTC's store and let me say, this is not an experience you can describe. It is like trying to explain swimming to someone who never has, it's nearly impossible. What I can say is this: if you are curious about the kind of experience it provides and have the money, absolutely buy it. My mother, who hasn't played a video game in her life, was blown away by some of the things she saw in The Lab.Every single person I have demoed it for has been stupefied, and the content just keeps coming. Justin Roiland, creator of Rick and Morty is releasing a VR game soon for free on Steam. I've heard great things about Raw Data too, but my number one recommendation is Audioshield then Job Simulator. Both are extremely fun, in very different ways.The reason for the headline of this review is the roomscale is really what sold me on the experience. It is what made me feel as though I was actually in the worlds I was experiencing, and not simply ""watching"" things happen. Roomscale makes all the difference, and you don't really need all that much space but obviously the more the better.

Absolutely love this VR system. Went back and forth for a long time between PSVR, Oculus or HTC Vive. But out of them only HTC Vive seemed to have the full solution.I'm running an I7, 12GB and GTX970 and it gives my system a good workout so be sure to run the Hardware compatibility checker before you purchase. The graphics aren't as good as I was hoping for, but that is probably because my graphics card is really at the minimum recommended spec. But even with that said the graphics don't matter as much as the immersion. With the immersion even the simplest of games become a joy to play. Looking at 360 degree photos is amazing and can make you feel like you are there. There is no way to describe it other than to say just experience it. I bought this on an impulse purchase (a very large impulse purchase) and I can say it's the best toy I've bought for myself in a long long time.

Pros: the world's best tracking (which won't always be exclusive to the Vive, it's Steam VR tracking), can be worn with any kind of headphones, including bulky circumaural headphones, supports full proper room-scale (the others are intended more for front-facing games mostly)Cons: the head-mounting (in this case straps) aren't the best way to wear a VR headset, though they do keep it securely in place, and of course that does not mean the deluxe audio strap isn't better, I just haven't tried that, so it could negate this con altogetherOther: some people talk about a ""screen door effect"", which you can see if you look for it, but I don't think it's a big deal

Tonight was my second night with it and I can see the chaperone in my dreams. The feeling you first get is like the feel you get when using a very destruction drug for the first time. I wouldn't know but I could only imagine. I felt out of whack after day 1 and after just now using it, I am scared I will have to kill a robot from destroying my bed.The games are so immersive. The sounds are amazing with the right headphones. The games are phenomenal!! I mean holy cow. I watched video after video on YouTube from how excited I was. But nothing prepared me for the amazement I received when I got it all hooked up. A true ""you have to see it to believe it"" industry of experiences.The oculus is good buuuuut the VIVE has hands down taken me away. The visuals. The ROOM SCALE.

Owning this thing was a chore. It's a good, sleek VR set I'll give them that. Controllers are nice and easy to grip. Everything's easy to set up and the guide is straight forward. However. This VR set was a pain with me. Throughout the week that I owned this thing, I've relocated sensors about a dozen times over, went through the setup process, and have contacted the help line on the web and phone because the damn sensors would not work. I would play a game and a controller would freeze, or a sensor would just randomly go offline. I had to constantly restart games over and over again. And even without those internal issues, I still had to cover my mirror and window to prevent sensor issues. Also the visual quality is sub-par as I could easily see pixels. And even as someone with roughly 20 20 vision, I still couldn't read text without squinting.Anyway if you have the money and the time, buy this because what I've played so far was fun. But if you don't have a lot of disposable income and time, then wait for newer releases. If you want a basic VR experience get the Oculus. It's $400 and it should be the same thing as the VIVE.

I received my VIVE for Christmas and I have to say that I loved it, until it just up and broke one day. I had used it for 3 months and then the display just would not turn on anymore. Sent it back to HTC for repair and surprise, they said liquid damage. Attached were three blurry photos of what I assume are repair ticket information, a liquid damage indicator (LDI) and some random cabling. A device that was $500 was estimated for repair at $270 based on a LDI, which is known to be an inaccurate measurement of actual damage to the boards inside. I made sure that no liquids were ever near the Headset, only moderate sweating as well.EDIT:Worked after a cable swap $15 then all of a sudden the track pad refuses to click on the right side on one of my controllers. It broke just shy of three months out of warranty support, not like that ever helped. I'm thinking of saving up for the Valve index rather than buy another HTC headset.

I own both the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Vive offers a wide play field and more walk-around experiences with access to an extensive library of games via Steam. The Rift offers more comfort with a lighter weight headset and ergonomic controllers, along with a smaller but well-curated library of games via Oculus Home. If you have the space (10x10 feet at least) then my recommendation is for the Vive. The ability to walk around in VR is something I would not give up. But if you are lacking space, live in a small apartment or dorm, then I recommend the Rift as it's going to offer some stellar stand-in-place VR experiences. Both are fantastic systems, but because I have the space to experience some of the larger walk-around games available, I find myself playing with the Vive most often.

I didn't buy my Vive from Amazon.  This is a review of the device itself.I second people who say that it's a different animal than the Samsung Gear.  It totally blows that experience out of the water.Right now VR experiences seem to come in 2 varieties: room-scale and seated.Your 3 choices are Oculus Rift, Vive, and Sony PS VR.The Rift doesn't support room-scale yet.  And their controls don't come bundled.  It's too simple to say, just buy the controllers.  Why?  It's because devs designing games for the Vive KNOW that it comes with controllers, and so they often take full advantage of that.And that's where the Vive really shines: room-scale VR.  You'll be parrying with a sword, blocking with a shield.  Ever see those movies where you are wielding 2 guns ganster-style?  You can do that on a Vive.The Vive's field of view is pretty good.  Playing subnautica was particularly immersive (pun intended), because the game already makes you feel like you have scuba gear on and the vive feels just like that: a heavy scuba mask.  The two together make for an amazing underwater experience.I build a decent rig around a 1080 GTX to go with Vive to max the potential.  I can't recommend upgrading to do this because of the price, but if you have the means, then I can whole-heartedly recommend the experience.Don't worry about nausea: most games have teleport movement and comfort features.  I only experienced some mild discomfort on games that didn't support the vive explicitly (like subnautica does not yet).Can't wait for Fallout 4 VR to be released!

I've been in love with the idea of VR since I was a kid, drooling over the VFX1 ads in PC Gamer back in the 90's. Fast forward to a couple years ago and was in love with Oculus and purchased the Rift DK1 and later the DK2 without hesitation. I am well versed in the technologies and components that make up modern VR headsets and can tell you without question that the HTC Vive is currently the best VR headset currently available. No other headset will give you the tracking precision or wide field of view that you get with the Vive.The price tag may give you pause, but rest assured that if you can justify (and afford) the expense, you will not regret it. I find myself not wanting to play games anymore unless it is in VR. The experience is just so incredible that going back to a regular monitor just isn't all that appealing. So if you have the money, do it! You will not have any regrets!

One of the base units ""camera"" was defective right out of the box. I did not want to return the whole unit because I already drilled holes in my walls for the bases and did not want to patch and drill again. So I returned the base unit to Vive HTC in Flower Texas. I had to pay the shipping back to them. I was told it would take 2 weeks. They had the unit for 1 week  (per UPS) before checking the unit in. They said the 2 weeks clock starts when the unit is checked in and not when they get it. Supposedly they will be mailing in back to me sometime next week. So it will be about 6 weeks that they had the factory defective unit before I get it back. I have played with the Vive system. When it is working it is very cool.

HTC does not offer phone support, they don't offer advance RMA replacement, and they don't allow one to purchase a standalone base station 2.0.

Pros:- Setup is fairly painless, although I did have a slight issue. See comments further down- Controllers feel like an extension of your hands/arms- Great immersion factorCons:- Headset strap a bit small for my big head- Headset strap a bit big for my son and wife- Software likes to crash on occasion and takes a while to detect all devices before everything's ready to go- not cheapOther Thoughts:I bought the HTC Vive directly from HTC, but I wanted to share my thoughts on Amazon. First off, make sure you have an HDMI or DisplayPort... port... free on your graphics card. The headset comes with an HDMI cable, but no DisplayPort cable, so I had to unplug one of my monitors to use the device. If needed, either order a mini-to-regular DisplayPort cable with this, or an adapter/other cable that works with your setup.Setting up the device was rather easy, however, I had some issues with the included plastic plugs for securing the wall mounts. After drilling into my drywall, I noticed that the plugs didn't seem like normal drywall plugs. The ends were solid and they did not fit in all the way as I'm accustomed to with most plugs that I've dealt with. Undeterred, I decided to use them anyway only to have the plugs slip through into my walls as I was securing the mounts. After doing some research, I found out the plugs were actually meant for using with brick/concrete (oops). I ended up mounting directly into the studs (which I usually do when mounting stuff to the wall, but didn't this time for some reason...) and patching up the original holes I made.The headset is comfortable, although the straps weren't as adjustable as I was hoping. I have a fairly large head and most hats don't fit me, so it wasn't a surprise for myself. It's just a bit too big for my wife and 11-year-old son as well, so we have to ""max out"" the adjustments to get it to stay on their heads. It's not a deal-breaker though and the headset still stays on just fine. We just have to deal with minor adjustments while playing as the headset will shift a bit on our heads. Hopefully the premium strap coming out later this year will have a better fit for all of us.Overall, I'm really liking the VR experience. I initially thought it gimicky, but after trying out Google Cardboard, I bit the bullet and got the Vive for a ""real"" VR experience. I was not disappointed. I downloaded most of the popular free VR games and they're all great experiences. Waltz of the Wizard is by far my favorite, along with The Lab. It's also great exercise as well if you have the space for a room-scale setup. I spent a good 45 minutes to an hour playing Lightblade VR night and only had to stop because I was sweating so much that the headset was slipping off. Speaking of Lightblade VR, get it. It's $4 USD and makes you feel like a Jedi.

The experiences to be had with the Vive are incredible, bordering on profound. It gets 5 stars from me because this outweighs anything that might rationally be considered a drawback.I've demoed my Vive to something like 50 people. I've become a Vive evangelist. I can say that every single person that has tried this system has had their opinion of VR altered for the better. I've shown seasoned gamers sporting doubtful smirks, techno-phoebes who are afraid of technology, and people who may have tried a Gear VR and were convinced that this was only going to be slightly better. They've all taken off the headset with minds that are forever and irreversibly blown. The post Vive reactions range from ""That was way cooler than I thought it was going to be"" to ""This is life changing technology and please tell me how to buy one immediately."" A few folks have been emotionally caught off guard, with tears welling up. I fell like demoing this thing is important work.Now, the wife and I have gotten somewhat used to the Vive after 6 months of almost daily use, but it still brings us joy. It's an investment that neither of us regret. It's magical.Anyway, enough gushing. The negatives, because they do exist and are worth mentioning:- It's expensive and you need a good PC to run it well.- Setup takes a while but it's not terribly difficult if you plan ahead and follow the directions.- Once you've setup the Vive, it's hard to move it around. It's not like a game console that you can pack up and re-connect with few cables in another new room.- The resolution may disappoint some, but that's become less of an issue with Vavle's recently improved software: Supersampling, and Asynchronous Re-projection, namely.- The games are a mixed bag, but they are getting better. There's just so much content really, but not a lot of great content.- It can be finicky, sometimes. Frankly, given it's complexity, the system works great. There's really only the occasional bug.- It's not something you would do to relax. Depending on the game, the Vive is very mentally and physically engaging.Anyway, I hope this helps. There's no turning back kids. I think VR is here to stay.

NOTE: This shortened review comes after using the Vive for about a month (got it through other channels), used both for content creation (3D) and ""play"". I also have the PSVR and have used the RIFT extensively.First of all:I recommend you do NOT buy the Vive unless you are in the business of game development or just want to blow some money.Why:1. The product still feels like a prototype, rather than a consumer ready product. HTC is not known for making the best decisions, business or otherwise. While Valve is backing HTC on this product, HTC has not exactly instilled confidence on a hardware level. There are many other more reliable hardware brands (as revealed at CES 2017) which I believe may approach and work with Valve.2. The Vive itself is great at tracking... when it works. Dealing with the VIVE can be a nightmare. When it works, it works well enough. When it doesnt, well you have to spend a lot of time going through the process of getting it back on ""track"" (pun intended). The wands go flying off into the distance only to reappear in your hand, or the headset will just jump off in a direction despite not moving at all. You have to constantly re-calibrate the headset with steamVR.  It is simply not worth the headache and hassle from a consumer point of view. Both the RIFT and the PSVR offer more ""accessible"" solutions/approaches to tracking and layout, granted the tracking may not be as good BUT it has been far more consistent in behavior (for me at least).3. Screen door effect. The panel is not the best choice. When you mix it with the ridged fresnel lens, you not only get this annoying lens flare effect but it also highlights the edges in the lens making it seem very unnatural. Mix that with the noticable empty spaces between pixels and its really not the best choice for VR (which I believe they learned from this time around). For contrast purposes, the PSVR chose not to use fresnel lens which has reduced that lens flare effect for the most part. They also went with a higher density subpixel panel (that despite being lower resolution ends up being sharper than the VIVE/RIFT). This also has the benefit of higher refresh rates.4. Design. Everything from the size of the headset to the nature of the light houses is just rough. Its not going to look good. The headset is heavy, awkwardly shaped, the wands are too. Its just not a good experience past the ""wow"" factor of VR in general.5. Price. Not worth it. Its a prototype and HTC looks like they are going to milk it for all its worth with the cost of accessories (like the new headstrap) pushing the consumer well past the $1000 mark. Not worth it for sub par VR on what feels like a prototype.Advice. If you want to get a taste of VR, something to play around with and experience while the technology grows (and while new brands come into the market), go with something like the PSVR or RIFT (and I do not recommend that lightly, as I really do not like the FACEBOOK platform).

BUY THIS NOW, BUT ONLY IF:You have done your research.  The Vive is not a simple, ""oh look something VR and cool, I bet that would be fun.""Do your research.  I have had the Vive for about a month now.  I've had 3 different 'Vive Parties'  and have put over 100 hours on these goggles.  I can't begin to describe to you how amazing, and how much fun my friends, myself, fiance, and family have all had with it. Over 15 people have put on my goggles (buy extra face pads),  and not a single person has been disappointed. There are so many games on Steam & Viveport, and many of them you can get for free, so you are sure to find a game for everyone.  My family loves the escape rooms, and watching the occasional person freak out during a horror game!The most difficult and off putting part about The Vive is it's set-up time.  No, I'm not talking about drilling the light house towers into your living room wall.  To even run The Vive, you will need a strong computer.  I have a $1700 computer because I am a huge gamer.  Not that you need that expensive of a computer, but it definitely helps.  You can get away with a good rig for under a grand.  However not everyone can afford these kind of set-ups.  I have my Vive also hooked up to a TV in the same room so other people can enjoy watching the gameplay.  There is a certain knowledge and background you need going into this Hobby, and it is not as simple as plug and play.  DO YOUR RESEARCH.Overall, The Vive is one of the best purchases I have ever made at $500.  This is simply because I am already a huge gamer and had the computer, TV, and space available in my house.  If you are fresh to the gaming world, and wondering whether or not dropping $2,000 to get into the VR world is worth it... Then it may be best to pass on this for now.  VR capabilities are only going to get stronger and cheaper. Just remember DO YOU RESEARCH.  DO NOT buy this hoping it will be ready to play right out of the box.

Well to start, setup is okay, however once it's done, it's DONE! Cable can be a little heavy when you first put it on, never noticed it myself however since it sort of fades away when you start playing. As for headphones, I highly suggest a way to manage that hanging cable from them, I've yanked mine out before plenty of times flailing my arms in thin air, earbuds. Headset can be a feel heavy, I recommend getting familiar with how all three straps adjust, the top one tends to be a little clingy when adjusting, but, all three CAN be adjusted to fit anyones head for the most part. Also, I HIGHLY recomend giving the setup as much room as possible, room scale play feels insanely good.As for games...1.) Well, got my wife to sit through PART of ""The Visitor"", she nearly threw the headset off when the ghost moved the teddy bear in front of her, spooked her senseless.2.) Audioshield - High beet songs on expert for an hour, FUN workout when you really try to go at it, fun tip, dance a little to the music, it helps, that and you zone out until your arms and legs feel like their jellifying on you XD.3.) Horde Z - Again, fun, standing experience with zombies coming out, for this wear headphones, so you can gauge direction for the giant ugly guys, they scared my wife half to death when she heard them and turned around.4.) Other games... well, there are quite a few, and I always recommend trying them out, OR watch youtube HTC Vive ""Insert game title here"" gameplay to see if it's interesting enough at this point.

My fiance told me to wait until after our wedding to buy this.Well, after a couple months of waiting I had to sneak out and buy one (bought from Microcenter, not Amazon).It's a testament to the HTC Vive that I was in the doghouse for as long as it took for me to strap the headset on her.Seriously though, even after owning it for 2+ months and even after the WOW factor has dropped off there are so many uses for it I see it as an essential peripheral. Feel like getting a workout today? Play Holoball or Audioshield. Have a friend over and want to see him wet himself in fear? Put him in a schizophrenic's mind in A Chair in a Room. Want to feel like you're part of 4-man Rainbow 6 squad? Onward has got your back.The amount of content out there so early on is simply amazing. I've already racked up over 60 games but feel like I can't even keep up with the weekly releases (or that I have to, as I have PLENTY of ground to cover in the games/experiences/alternate-lives I've picked up already).If you can swing this - even if it means surviving on ramen for a few months - your hunger for an unparalleled virtual experience will be more that sated.

In contrast to what everyone else says (and I don't really trust everyone else's objectivity on this issue) I feel that the ergonomics of this are dramatically worse, from a gamer's perspective, than the original Vive.All of the professional reviews state how the headset does not stay secure on the face when doing quick moves. Do not underestimate that fact and its importance to the things Vive users historically use their Vives for, like Holopoint and Space Pirate Trainer. The Vive Pro, in my view, was not designed with these types of games in mind. The effect of this, when you're actually trying to replace a Vive with a Vive Pro, becomes hard, if not impossible to brush aside.I would have returned my Vive Pro for this reason, but I found that one of the main fundamental problems with the headstrap can be fixed with a destructive modification: taking a dremel to an inner part of the headstrap hinge. If you are not interested in doing that, you may find the Vive Pro not usable for your active games.The problem is that the new headstrap is kept from swiveling down at all, with a hard stop. This prevents the cushions at the back from cupping the back of the head without lifting the cheek parts off the face. The cushion at the back is also angled wrong so the wide bottom part of the triangle is kept away from the head while the narrow top part of the triangle is what is making contact. That is, unless you place the back of the strap so high that the earphones no longer reach the ears (which is another problem of the hinge).With so little width actually cupping the head (in comparison to the DAS, which has a very wide contact area wrapping around the back of the head) the Pro is very unstable.By removing the tab of plastic inside of the swivel (work in progress for me), and by changing the angle of the triangular back pad to contact better, as well as adding pads to the rear sides of the head (as the DAS has) I will be able to get much more contact with my head, and make the headset more secure.I believe that HTC does not know how to design a comfortable, secure headstrap. I have been modding the original Vive and DAS since I got them. This headstrap is a big step down in gaming usability, and if you are not interested in destructively modding it with some careful dremel work, I would think carefully about whether you want to use the Vive for active games. It doesn't seem like a big deal until you get it in your hands, then realize that it can't be fixed just by adjusting the straps or cushions.For the full picture: I'm also adding a weight-bearing forehead cushion like I did with my DAS. Neither headset is comfortable without it.

Although pricey, there is no experience that can truly compare to that offered by the HTC Vive. Previous attempts at virtual reality fell flat as they lacked the resolution and refresh rate to give a nausea-free experience. We are on the verge of sufficiently advanced and affordable mainstream technology which can power VR for the average person. As with all new technology, the price is a bit high and the product has room for improvement, but the current experience is well worth the price tag for those who can afford it! What's most exciting is being in at the beginning of this new, emerging technology. That is what convinced me to throw my money down and buy it - even though I had never tried it in person - and it did not leave me disappointed.Having tried both the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, I can honestly say that they are more similar than different (other than room scale capability... In which the HTC Vive is far superior). There is a lot of good things to say about the Rift, but Room Scale made all the difference in the world (and, to be frank, some shady moves made by Oculus/Facebook...). Room scale is what really *makes* the VR experience. I've never even gotten close to being nauseous while playing a room scale game, and it's easy to get completely immersed in the experience.A word of warning, the current games out are fantastic, but the arcade-style games don't keep my interest the way some other games do. That being said, they're still a worthwhile in their own right, and I'm looking forward to continued development. Google Earth recently came out with a VR app which is mind-bogglingly amazing in the experience and nearly limitless in content.So, if you need a push to buy it, DO IT! Just don't put yourself in a tight economic spot to do so.

This has been the best ""gaming system"" I have ever bought.  I haven't touched my PS4 since I've received it in April because it is way more fun to actually be in a game than watching it from the outside.From simple multiplayer games like Paddle Up's ping pong to first person multiplayer shooters like Onwards, this system has it covered. The tracking is unreal and the there are well over 100 games that range from free to $30. Many of my favorites are less than $10.Heads up, racing games may make you sick. I have a hard time with Project Cars and Distance even though they are gorgeous in VR. I'm way more into the sports and shooter games than you have to move your body in.Also, try to get a Nvidia 980 or AMD 480 graphics card or better in your computer for the best experience.Feel free to checkout my twitch game play. twitch.tv/elev8dity

I don't understand how you can sell a product that is prone to break regardless if it is attached to a wall, mishandled, or perfectly maintained. With the rate of issues of the lighthouses and my amazement to how many people this happens too, shocks me how you guys haven't been issued a class action. 2 years seems like a time frame before something on this system is bound to go wrong when properly maintained. Then you send it off and get sent a quote on the repair cost. No wonder people use the rift, which I have both rift and vive. The ease of use with rift is just so much more and there are not really any parts it seems that can go wrong without you having to smash it on a wall. And people the issue I am talking about is the issue of the sensors you mount to the wall which have moving gyros in them. Well doesn't matter if you move them around or have them mounted on the wall. You still get the shaft from the company because they know it will eventually break, only a matter of time. It could cost upwards of 95 dollars to fix just one lighthouse not including your shipping cost to get it there. God help, the amount of time it takes to get it back, i haven't heard good things about that as well. Why do we have to pay 500-700 dollars for a product that doesn't have good reliability?

Have not touched a non-VR game since I bought the Vive over 3 months ago.  The Vive is incredibly fun and immersive!  I haven't been this excited about video games since I was 10 years old and the Nintendo 64 was released.  The future is here and it's only going to get better.  Complete game changer.Besides the fun of playing VR I am in much better shape simply from playing roomscale VR.  VR can be quite a good way to burn calories.Also, this thing is built like a tank!  I stuck one of the controllers into a ceiling fan and the controller survived with only a few scuffs.  The metal fan blade was bent...  I've also punched a few walls and ceilings and these controllers are holding strong.  Heard of people running into walls with the headset and even face planting on the floor (lol) and the headset survived!  Excellent build quality.I was originally worried that it was too early to get into VR but man am I glad I did.  Especially glad I got a Vive rather than a Rift.  I have been playing every single day for 1-2+ hours and I can't keep up with all of the games & experiences I still have in my queue.  The Vive is on a totally new level.  You have to try it to understand.  I've had the pleasure of demo'ing VR to a lot of people and it without fail surpasses everyone's expectations.  This is not just for gamers...VR is for everyone.  One of the best purchases I have ever made in my life!

Bought from Microcenter. Have about 30 hours of use. It's the best VR product experience you can have right now. Price is several hundred more than i'd expect if there was anything that competed with it, although vendors like Samsung and Asus have reasonably decent WMR headsets for less than half the price including controllers with tracking.  The vive pro headphones are not that great.Still... when I put this thing on and cranked up the supersampling and started playing Skyrim VR... holy crap. What a amazing experience..  And then playing a game like GORN... fun fun fun. My Watch has told me that i've been burning 3 times as many calories each day on average since I bought the Vive pro. I cannot wait for the wireless accessory. If you have the money to burn and a large play area then the vive pro plus upcoming wireless accessory will change video game enjoyment for you forever.  A totally innovative experience (just like the original vive), except higher resolution, much more comfortable and stupidly expensive.

The VR experience is cool.  The vive handles feel nice, not too bulky to me.  The problem is with the hardware.  I haven't used my vive much since I got it other than two games early on.  I bough Alyx and decided to fire it back up excitedly and . . .one of the base stations didn't work.  After troubleshooting with the support they told me sorry - 90$ repair or you're out of luck.  I've only used the system for about 20 hours all together (it's easy to track thanks to steam).  Definitely go with something else.  I wish I would have.

My daughter had the Vive and had issues with a base controller not updating the firmware. All other hardware easily updated. I had a warranty so I returned it. I ended up getting her the Vive Pro. After having it for less than a week, she had the headset on her chair and as she pushed the chair out of the way to play, the headset fell off the chair. The cord was tangled so she thought she had a lot more room. This is about 12 inches. The fall cracked the thin plastic headband. I have seen iPhones drop from 3-4 feet with zero impact and this breaks after a short fall? It is a $200 repair from HTC. Based on hardware issue I had as well as what I would consider a quality issue, I would suggest you factor in an accident plan into your purchase. It will be the best money you ever spent.

Started out great fun to play. About a week and a half past the return date the vive stopped working. We did all the trouble shooting on steam and htc's sites nothing helped. Contacted HTC Tec support they gave a few others to try but they didn't work. Sent the head set in for repair. HTC is telling me to pay $270.00 for the repair. they say its water damaged. How can you make something that gets strapped to your body (head) and not make it water (sweat)  proof. I own watches and phones that are water proof. And for the head set not to be is a manufacturer flaw.  Also HTC changed the wording of their warrantee from does not cover water damage other than perspiration to does not cover water damage. So now I'll have to contact a lawyer , BBB and consumer protection  agency

I Purchased this straight from HTC because I wasn't willing to wait. Will you have to go through some setup? Oh yes. Are the system requirements high? For the good games yea. Is it worth it, oh my god yes. I used to think ""where is gaming going to go now that graphics are peaking, aaa sequels are spawning left and right, and there is nothing new to make."" Now I'm genuinely excited for gaming again now that VR is starting to emerge. Raw Data alone is proof of concept enough, stack on that the best of the best like hollowpoint, space pirate trainer, and horseshoes hotdogs handgrenades and the experience has been breathtaking.

Just because we are going through a pandemic doesn’t mean you should start raising the price three times it’s own brand new price... definitely not worth it what so ever and I’d rather get a valve index from valve themselves that has a headset WAY BETTER than this one FOR ALMOST THE SAME DAMN PRICE OR EVEN LESS!!

Writing this review for the second time because Amazon took down the first review without cause.  Amazon, if it happens again I'm done with you.  I have been a customer for 21 years.I bought the original Vive from Amazon about 6 weeks ago and it worked well.  It was my first try at VR.  Shortly thereafter I pre-ordered the Vive Pro directly from HTC since I thought I would get it quicker.  I probably would have received it quicker from Amazon.I don't want to drone on with things others have said so I'll just say quickly, yes it does have noticeably better resolution and it is more comfortable.  Is it worth $800 for the upgrade?  For me it is.  I plan to spend a lot of time using VR.The part that doesn't seem to get mentioned is that if you already own the original Vive you get a loyalty bonus for buying the vive pro that softens the financial blow a little.  The bonus consists of a 1 year subscription to Viveport ($108 value) and $100 Viveport wallet cash to buy games, apps, etc.  Some people don't like Viveport but you get to use 5 games per month in your subscription and with the $100 you can also buy some games, so this can save you some money after the purchase.

I've had mine since May 2016 and still use it regularly. I also had an Oculus DK2 (sold once the Vive came) and have a Gear VR. Without fail, everyone who tries my Vive is very impressed. You need a powerful PC to run it though. If you're low on cash, I wouldn't recommend buying it, but, if you have disposable income, go for it. I recommend mounting the base stations to the wall or using rigid floor to ceiling contractor poles rather than using tripods. You want to minimize vibrations as much as possible to maintain good tracking. Also, you don't want any reflective surfaces in the play space. Remove or cover them.

I really, really want to like this and to be fair sometimes I do. The entire system plays kind of like a Steam Early Access game. The concepts are there and many of them are pretty good, but it's not polished at all. My main issues are as follows:-Game library is small, and most of not worth the money. We're talking 10 hours or less of gameplay.-Games are full of bugs. I've yet to play a game that doesn't crash on me sooner or later.-The hardware is as buggy as the games. I watch my controller drift off into the distance, get confused with the headset, or sometimes duplicate itself for no reason.From everything I can tell this is still the best option in the VR space, but I'm not convinced it's worth the money. I can only hope that things get better with time.

This review is specifically about the condition the system was received in, and has no bearing on the actual use of the product.When I received the Vive Pro system, it was missing the power supply and the display port cable.

So let me start by saying that using the vive has been one of the most incredible gaming experiences of my life. The games themselves are a bit disappointing but the vive usually makes up for there shortcomings. The tracking is scary accurate to the point where you can often find the controller irl from inside the headset. Also the headset itself is so well tracked that I'm completely comfortable staying inside of these worlds for hours at a time. Based just on the experience I would rate it a 6/5 stars every time.However there is a glaring issue that makes the product a huge waste of money for a large portion of people. Water damage is not covered under the htc limited warranty. You may be thinking ""why would it if you spilled something on this product it's your own fault."" However I'm not talking about spilling something I'm talking about sweat. If you are someone prone to heavy sweating you will cause water damage to the vive it is inevitable. I was as careful as I could have possible been with the vive and I still have gone through two vive's at the time of this post, where each vive lasted 3 days before the screen went black. On the second one I was using waterproof covers paper towels alongside the lenses to soak up anything that got in, dried it out extensively whenever I was done using it, and stored it screen up so that anything that I missed would drain out of the headset. Despite these precautions the second one is currently dead and I'm currently debating whether or not to get another replacement or just full refund. The only thing I did not try was using a headband which may help but I don't think it will 100% solve the problem.One thing I will say is that if you do decide to get it, get it from Amazon because they have the no questions asked refund policy so that if this happens to you you can get your money back. HTC will not offer you anything close and the way their customer service department works they obviously don't stand behind their product.Pro: great expierienceIncredible gamingWorks like it's supposed to ( while it last)Con: prone to water damage due to sweatWater damage not covered under HTC limited warrantyHTC customer service is subpar

I've demoed my Vive to over 70 people with age ranges from 2 y/o to 63 y/o.  I'd say 60+ were absolutely blown away.  The other 5-10 still really liked it.  This is amazing technology that is coming big time over the next few years.I've had 3 different VR headsets in the past and they were great but being able to walk around in VR takes it to a whole different level. Some of the things you can do (not just games-like walking around Mars) are truly amazing.  Well worth the money to early enthusiasts.But-this is a first gen product.  It's revolutionary but not perfect and still expensive considering you need a high end PC.

I bought this and recently had to send it back to HTC for repair.  After shipping it over night to them, I hadn't heard back from support so I called them about 6 days later.  Found out that they didn't know what was going on and asked for my RMA number and my FedEx tracking number.  FedEx confirmed that it had been received the previous week.  They updated my status to show that it had been received the day I made the phone call, so lost 5 working days plus weekend.  That same day as my phone call the online status showed that it had been marked as water damage and the warranty wouldn't cover it.  The cost would be $270 to repair with a button to approve repair.  It was disappointing to find out that a kids sweat can ruin a headset, but I approved the repair on the website.  Nothing happened.  3 days later I called again and they explained the issue and asked if I wanted to proceed.  Clearly their website isn't hooked up to anything in their offices.  I approved it again and was told I would have to wait 5 days.  Apparently you have to call them constantly to get them to move forward and such a high price that something as little as sweat takes it down.  Really disappointed in the customer service and the quality of the product.

The Vive unit is wonderful.  Five stars for that.  Viveport I hate.  One star for that.  I would recommend use Steam for all purchases, and just completely avoid Viveport and their DRM lock-in.  It serves them, not you.  My Vive came with a bundle that included Google Tilt Brush.  I installed it, it didn't work, uninstalled and reinstalled it, and from now on, I get a cryptic error code that I eventually discovered meant ""Policy violation -- installed on too many devices"".  I am paying $20 to just buy it on Steam rather than wasting more hours fighting Viveport.

All i can say is WOW.  I bought this for Christmas out of the blue having never seen one in person.  3 months later i can say that i remain just as bowled over as the day i bought it.  It is SO COOL.  Every guest that cones over i make them try it and they bever want to leave.  My davorite game is QuiVR which exercises me greatly for 2 hours per day.  I have to strip down to shorts and t shirt or will sweat to death because so active.  Usually have to stop because arms badly cramping and can no longer hold them up.  Aerobic!  Would never gappen with ps4 because you are watching the action.  In VR you are living the action.  It seems that you are there and can maintain much higher energy levels when it seems your life depends on it.  Very commonly i get adrenaline rush because i am 200 fet up in air and might fall in VR even though i also know i am standing on living room floor.  So realistic and immersive!There are some cons.  Most of the software is still in development phase.  Even the rudimentary games are mire fun than full 2D ps4 games though.  The headset is heavy and the wire tether is annoying.  The earplugs get pulled out from time to time.  A lot of buggy software makes me have to reboot computer twice a day on average (get solid state drive to speed this way up).  The lighthouses dont turn on and off automatically.  None of ny friends have it yet.  I was so fired up after buying the vive I bought stock in nvidia and so far have lost money.  But i still have to give it 5 stars as the flatout most fun ive had in decades!  You wont be sorry.  Spend the cash!

My sister had just gotten this yesterday. Let me just say, DAMN. This thing is amazing. It took about an hour to get it set up and synced correctly but once it was set up and ready to go, we coyldnt wait to get started.This completely transforms your surroundings. You totally forget where you are. In one game she had, I was able to change my background to outer space and I felt like I was there. The graphics are awesome. And, thank God, in set up you trace your play area and it gives you boundaries lines that show up if you get too close to the edge of you play area, preventing you from running into or tripping over things.I would definitely recommend this. Hopefully they will come out with a two player version!

As a technology fanatic, virtual reality development is exciting to me. I also love to play a variety of video games. Putting these two together and the opportunity to use the HTC Vive, I was immediately hooked. The Vive is ideal for every type of gamer. This review will address tracking capabilities, interactive experience, graphics, resolution, and user-friendly controls. The Vive passes with flying colors.The first time putting on the comfortable head set and slipping into the welcome world of the main interface, you know that you will experience gaming in a new extraordinary way. To begin, the tracking capabilities are incredible. For example, my friend turned on the hand remotes across the room. While I was wearing the headset, the remotes blinked into existence. My friend then tossed the remotes to me, and I caught them with ease. To hit this home, that is the equivalent of being blindfolded but being fully aware of the remotes position in space.Selection of games is important and there are a variety of games to play in Steam VR, the game library that supports the HTC vive. You are sure to find a game that is in a genre you enjoy. The games are generally low priced with some games that are free. Although the price of the vive equipment seems high, it is well worth your money for the interactive, high quality experience. The first area I explored while using the Vive was the home world. Once loaded, I was standing on a metal island floating in space. It can be hard to realize what you are seeing is not real because the graphics and resolution are perfect. In well-developed games, you will not be able to see any pixilation.The user-friendly remotes make it easy to explore the world around you. While on the metal-island, I used the remote to teleport to the edge. I had to tell myself I could step over it because I was safe in my living room, but my whole body wanted to resist, as visually, I was looking into the abyss of space. Once removing the headset it is common to feel disoriented and it will take time to get use to using virtual reality. After a few uses, your body adjusts, and soon you will not feel the effects. After the experience, I was ready to share it with all my friends.Virtual reality is the new frontier of gaming. You can be a part of it while using the HTC Vive.

Although super nice and immersive for playing games. If you play and active game that will cause you to sweat. You run a high risk of ruining the vive headset. Not for anything workout related as far as cardio. Sweat is not covered in the warranty as they removed that part of it. So in theory you could buy this for 499.99. But if you plan to play a game like beat saber and you sweat into the headset, the risk is shorting of the mother board or other components of the head set. In which case you will have to pay to send it to HTC via ups, and then pay 270.00 for them too fix it once they evaluate it was water/liquid damage.If you plan to plan easy going moderate games that require little physical activity then fine buy this product. Otherwise might wanna look into other products like the oculus.

Their tag line ""it's real"" while a little corny, is an apt description in two ways. Yes virtual reality is here, it is 'real' and not some gimmick. Secondly, it is amazing how easily your mind is tricked into substituting the new fake reality for the real one.

Let me start off by saying that I don’t really write reviews.  I think this is my first or possibly second review I’ve ever written.  My experience with the Vive has been so positive, however, that I feel compelled to write something.  I’ll go through my setup experience, impressions, and then go over some of the games I’ve tried out.My system:  I did not buy the Vive from Amazon, only because I took advantage of a Cyber Monday deal and bought a Syber C Elite system that included the Vive with it for two hundred off its normal price.  This is for my family room and I’m using the system as an HTPC as well as the Vive.  I wanted a system that was console sized.  This one is a little bit bigger, but it still fits on my component rack.  I have it outfitted with an i7 overclocked to 4ghz, and a Geforce 1070, along with 16gb of ram.Setup:  The Vive arrived on December 23rd and came in a pretty sturdy box and everything was packed neatly in the box and in bags surrounded by lots of foam.  I had watched plenty of unboxing and setup videos beforehand to know what everything was for and how to hook everything up and get started.  I decided to go with tripods to mount the base stations as I didn’t want to put any permanent holes in our family room walls.  I also like how I can break it all down and hide it away if necessary.  Installation itself took about 30 minutes.  The only hitches I had were due to my putting the base stations a little too far apart so they had trouble communicating.  Once I moved the tripods a little closer, everything was fine and I was able to trace out my space.  I wound up with a play space of around a 3.5mx2.3m which is fine.  Ideally, you’d want more room to move around.  When you get close to hitting furniture or a wall, the Vive has something called the Chaperone system where it’ll bring up a blue (user changeable) grid around your play area to warn you not to go much further in that direction.  This is extremely useful and I haven’t had any instances where I’ve run into anything.First impressions:  The first time I put on the Vive, I thought the picture looked a bit blurry.  I wound up tightening the side straps, moving the display all the way close to my eyes and that seemed to help.  The Vive comes with a little sheet on how to measure your IPD, but I just turned the knob until it looked better and wound up around 65mm.  I’ll probably do an actual measurement at some point, but things look fine for now.  With a white room, you can definitely see some screen door effect and text isn’t ultra-sharp to read, but once you go into any sort of software you will forget about all of that.I loaded up the tutorial and it was magical.  You blow up some balloons and bat them around and shoot lasers and it just feels so real and natural.  My mom and brother were over for the holidays and they were watching this whole process since I mirrored what the HMD showed over to the tv.  What really blew me away was how accurate the controllers felt through the Vive.  This is not the Wii where there is lag when you move the controllers around.  This is true 1:1 movement here.  On a whim, I tossed one of the controllers in the air (not too far) and was able to catch it.  I don’t really recommend attempting that, but I can assure you that it’s possible.  In all the things I’ve tried so far, I’ve had ZERO motion sickness.  Most games use a teleporting style of movement which is supposed to keep you from getting sick.  I’ve found this system takes a little while to get used to, but eventually it becomes second nature.  Some games do use the traditional movement system, but I haven’t really tried those yet.I do not find the headset all that heavy or cumbersome either.  The cord can sometimes bunch up which takes you out of the immersion a little, but I’ve never been in danger of tripping over it or anything.  Some games I’ve played for hours without any ill effects.  I also haven’t really sweated a lot to make the foam face piece unusable.  They do include a second one that you can swap in, but they are also machine washable if necessary.  I have a ceiling fan in this room, so that helps I’m sure.As for games, I’d say that there aren’t any of your typical AAA titles out yet.  You aren’t going to play Call of Duty or Skyrim on this thing.  But what is out there is still pretty good, and most of it is reasonably priced.  There are a bunch of free things to download to get you started, and I think I’ve spent around $60 for 7-8 games so far.I’ll go over some of the games that my family and I have tried:The Lab:  This is the first game I tried, and probably the first that most people getting a Vive will try.  It’s Valve’s own creation and it’s basically a free collection of 8 mini games.  Not all the games are that good, but the overwhelming favorite one so far is Longbow.  You are an archer up on a tower and a bunch of black cartoony characters try to break down your door to sack your castle.  You need to use your hands to nock an arrow and then pull back the string and release to fire.  It feels really natural and you even get some force feedback when pulling back the string so it feels “right”.  This is the favorite game of my kids (5 and 7 year old boys) and they ask to play this every night.  If there’s any downside to the Vive, it’s that my kids love it so much, I really only get to use it now once they go to sleep.  On the other hand, if you need anything for leverage to get kids to behave, this works wonders.  Anyway, the other game that I like in this collection is Slingshot.  Think of this almost like a 3D Angry Birds.  Instead of birds, you fire these orbs (or Personality Cores) at piles of boxes and explosives.  The goal is to cause as much destruction as possible with the orbs.  There are a bunch of voices in the orbs that are pretty hilarious to listen to.Speaking of sound, for the first few days I just used the sound coming from my pc to my receiver.  I eventually tried the included earbuds and hated them because they kept falling out of my ears.  I already had a PlayStation Gold wireless headset, so I hooked that up to my pc and that works great.  I highly recommend some sort of wireless headset if you aren’t a fan of the earbuds.  What is nice is that you can mirror the sound of your headphones to your tv so people watching can also hear.Other than Xortex, which I haven’t tried yet, the rest of the games in The Lab are more like tech demos or sandbox environments.TheBlu:  I wanted something that I could use to show off the Vive, as well as have something that my kids might like.  TheBlu is great for that.  It has 3 different underwater scenarios and you are just really immersed in the experience.  You’ll see things such as a whale, jellyfish, schools of fish, a coral reef, etc.  You can move around a little and fish and jellyfish react to your controller.  I had my 67 year old mom try this, and she knows nothing about technology.  Once I got her started, I loaded up the whale simulation for her.  Once she understood how the controllers worked, she was amazed!  She was turning and looking in all directions, and when she turned and this huge whale was right in front of her she let out an audible shriek that the whole house could hear.  Good times!  She had so much fun that she wanted to do the other two experiences as well.  When those were over she told me that this was the most amazing thing she’s ever seen.  She even called me the next day just to reiterate how amazing it was!  Both of my kids wanted to try it and they still ask for this even though they’ve done them all multiple times already.Trials on Tatooine:  This is not so much a game as a “virtual reality experience”.  You follow some instructions and watch things unfold.  *Possible Spoiler Alert* There is a moment at the end where you get to wield a lightsaber and while you don’t get to do much, it feels pretty awesome.  Again, this is a huge hit with the kids and they’ve asked to do this multiple times.Accounting:  I didn’t care for this one, personally.  Being over 40, I don’t think I’m the target audience for this humor as I really didn’t understand it.  Lots of foul language involved, like, LOTS.Audioshield:  My favorite game for the system so far!  You’re allowed to choose from your favorite songs that are located on your PC or on Soundcloud and play the game to them. The way it works is that the game uses an algorithm to generate a beat and a rhythm. The gameplay is that the two controllers that you hold in either hand simulate a red and blue colored shield on each controller. Audioshield fires blue and red colored orbs at you and you need to block the colored orb with the corresponding shield.  The angles that the orbs can come from vary and alternate.  They might come from in front of you, or from the sky.  Your arms are going to end up crossing each other more than once. If you’re playing more than a couple of songs in one session, you will be getting a nice workout going on.  There’s also a third color, purple, where you have to hold both controllers together, or hold both triggers, to generate a purple shield to block it.  The fun part is that the game encourages you to “punch” the orbs to get style points, rather than just block the orbs passively.  You wind up sort of punch dancing to the songs and you really get into it.  If you’ve ever been a fan of the Guitar Hero or Rock Band franchises, you will definitely like this game.  The first night I tried it, I wound up taking off the headset and realizing that 3 hours had passed.  This is my go-to game every night, and I find that I can’t do just one song.  If you get a Vive, this is a must buy.Space Pirate Trainer:  This is my other current favorite game.  Space Pirate Trainer has you fighting off relentless waves of droids with various types of guns and a shield. You need to dodge incoming lasers or block them with your shield.  If you’re an older gamer like me, think of it like the wildest version of Space Invaders you could ever imagine.  Helps to have a decent amount of space for the room scale so you don’t keep seeing the chaperone system.  Another must buy in my opinion.Vanishing Realms:  Dungeon crawler.  Haven’t played it too much yet, but I like what I’ve seen so far.Nvidia VR Funhouse:  Another free collection of mini games in the style of what you might find at an amusement park.  I didn’t find this one too exciting, although it’s a hit with the kids.Budget Cuts Demo:  The full game isn’t out yet, but I really enjoy this one.  It really shows off what the room scale feature can do if done well.  I can’t wait for the full release.Waltz of the Wizard:  Another good freebie that puts you in a wizard’s lab and you get to manipulate objects to do various things.  It’s a nice sandbox environment with fantastic graphics and effects.  Definitely worth checking out at least once.Those are most of the more well-known games I’ve tried.  I definitely have a wishlist of games that I’ll be purchasing soon, such as The Brookhaven Experiment, Quivr, and Holopoint.  I’ve heard good things about these and can’t wait to try them.  Also, I can’t really speak to any sort of multiplayer games as I haven’t tried any yet.To sum this all up (and if you’re still reading this, thank you) I’ve only had this system a week so far, but hyperbole aside, this is easily the best thing I’ve bought in the last 10 years.  Perhaps after a few months my feelings might change but I really don’t expect that.  I just can’t wait to use this every night.

If you want to live in your video games then this is the system to buy. Others are great as well, but not quite at the same level. This comes out of the box with all you need to be in a full room scale virtual reality. Others either can't, or with the oculus rift you need to buy extra parts. Those extra parts also mean more wires in your home and take up all of your USB ports. And not only games. There's educational programs, racing and flight simulators, there's nothing you can't do in virtual reality. In virtual reality it is so much better than a flat screen.Buy one now! You know you want to! You're ready to take a flight to the moon on apollo 11. You're ready to survive a zombie apocalypse.

This was a real blast.  I own a Samsung Gear VR and while it's ok.  The HTC vive was even more fun.  I haven't tried a bunch of games yet, but the ones I have tried have been a blast.  As far as price goes.  This does set you back $800.  It is pretty steep, but as with any of the latest and greatest gadgets.  You will be spending a lot.  The Rift is cheaper and I will be reviewing that as well.  Sure there will always be improvements that can be made and of course at a better price.  But for right now, this is what's available.  If you have the cash, I would say you should try it.  Lots of scary games if you like that stuff too.  I would recommend this.

The HTC Vive is amazing, I have spent countless hours in it and every time I put it on I have an amazing time, that is when it works. I have had so many issues with the HTC Vive that honestly I would rather rip my teeth out then try to troubleshoot it for the 200th time and it gets so much better and so much worse with the trackers you can get for it. While being able to see yourself move in vr like you would in real life, you also have to deal with trying to fight the trackers to keep their pairing. all this being said If you want to experience vr I highly recommend the HTC Vive. My only wish in the future is that they fix all the problems that come with it.

Title says about it. Really sad honestly because I was really looking forward to using this product, with everything I've heard. But one of the controllers doesn't work out of the box, seemly. The other one is at a decent charge and connected instantly. But even trying to charge the other one brings no response. It's just a really dead controller, no led or anything. Hope this can be fixed soon. I was looking forward to using it on my days off. Maybe not though.

Playing games like Cloudlands Mini Golf, Serious Sam and Virtual Pool will really showcase what VR can do. Games like Resident Evil 7 will show what it can do in the future. If you are worried about the expense, with the Vives included controllers the Oculus will end up costing you almost the same after purchasing those.

Also with the VIVE don't forget to enable Super Sampling to drastically increase the graphics quality in your games. You can increase Super Sampling (SS) more with better hardware.

I originally questioned spending $800 for the Vive, but after playing games in room-scale I can say I'm happy with my purchase.  The price tag is steep and I can't say it was a completely responsible purchase, but if you have the money to spend it is a solid experience.  The kid in me loves stepping into a world.  I've explored dungeons, caves, and alien planets.  I've been an starship pilot, a wizard, and a secret agent. The Vive is easily the most immersive and exciting gaming experience I've ever had.The Good:Room-scale is an amazing experienceLong battery life on motion controlsRoom scale and 90Hz display make for minimal motion sicknessGreat positional tracking gives good presenceThe Bad:First time setup takes a bit of time and workI've never tripped over the cable, but it can be a bit cumbersomeSlight screen door effect, but it's hardly noticeable once you're moving around and interacting with the game worldFairly large space is required for the best experienceGame library is solid, but does not contain any AAA titles currentlyBeefy PC requirements

Stay away from this no customer service company.  I purchased the wireless HTC Pro system and paid an additional nearly $300 for premium service.  Well, the system is flawed with major motion delays and the customer service, well there is none.  I spent 3 days with text chat support and no solution was found which is not surprising since the same technician is working with numerous other clients simultaneously.

First ever review - but this thing blew away all my expectations.  The VIVE is a game changer - a true paradigm shift of how we'll all consume media in the near future.  I've never experienced anything like this.  It isn't without limitations:1.  You need a beefy computer to run this - I'd recommend a gpu of 1070 minimum2.  Based on #1 - there is a high start-up/access-point cost3.  You need a good sized room to move around (you could always experience it seated but that defeats the point of having the VIVE)4.  The headset is tethered (I heard they're coming out w a wireless model in 2017)Positives:1.  The experiences are incredible - the free Lab software (you download it) is a great way to get familiar with how VIVE works.  It is so much fun and well polished.  The Blu - another amazing experience of going underwater.2.  You're on the bleeding edge of something big - very few people really have this, you can invite anyone over and they'll be blown away by what they see.3.  Really it is all #1 - the experiences, the feelings - I kept saying ""omg, omg, omg"" I was up til 2am the first night I set it up and back up again at 6am to go back and play w it..I haven't felt like that since I was a kid.Bottom line - if you've got ability to run w this (strong computer, large room and the $$$) - there is nothing like this...buy it and see for yourself.

This platform is a huge leap forward in technology, and in my opinion the best format for VR currently. It's realistic enough to trick your brain into believing you are somewhere else, meaning you will feel afraid to walk off a virtual ledge or be attacked by skeletons even though you logically know they're not real.If you're trying to decide between the vive and rift, the immersion you get from being able to walk around things cannot be understated. If you go with the rift, you cannot move out of the view of the desktop camera, so you cannot walk around within the virtual environment. It ends up being a big difference because it allows for gameplay like ducking behind cover, turning around to shoot something, etc. You can actually get pretty good exercise with the vive. That being said, both products are still first generation, so like all technology, the longer you wait the better things will get. Just understand that the rift is likely locked into seated gameplay for this generation due to its tracking system.

The best by far for quality of visuals of the current headsets.  It's easier on and off than original vive, which makes me want to use it more.  It had less cable issues than original vive, however, we have gone wireless which is highly recommended.  I still like the oculus controllers better than vive and oculus medium is the best sculpting app. Really, the vive pro wireless is the best vr overall.  It's not inexpensive, but I've found it very worth it. Recommend having a good graphics card though, or I don't know that someone will get the full benefit on the visuals.

I bought this only because of fallout 4, it cost me 600 bucks. The lenses on this thing look like they were made by someone who had 0 idea what they were doing. So when you use it all you see is big swirls around anything white, especially text. They put a piece of paper in the box, and expect you to go to mirror putting it on your face and accurately measure your pupils, which is totally impossible. I got 65 or so from that useless paper, the ps4 vr measured my eyes at 63. You may think its minor, but those swirls I was talking about are 10 times worse if you don't accurately get your eye measured. The thing is unshareable with anyone, because it takes hours to figure out how to get the damn thing to fit on your face right, and if you give it to someone else, they will mess it up. The strap that comes with it is useless, so you have to buy the upgraded one, which forces you to take the headphones off, because again a retard designed them. They press against your ears, and since it is plastic it makes them sweat, and after around an hour will start to hurt.  The thing weighs way too much, and you have to have it so tight to your face that if you wear it for hours it will make it feel like its still there after u take it off. I 100 percent feel forced to buy inferior garbage, because they only wanted to release it fallout on this garbage. Who ever designed this thing, must be boardline down syndrome. The only decent thing on it is the tracking system, which can be a pain in the ass to set up,  because they literally give you 0 explaination as how it actually works. So I had to research how it does work, to figure out where I needed to put the lighthouses.When I go back to Ps4 vr, which mind u is 450 dollars cheaper. The lenses are totally clear, it weighs at least a pound less, and can be worn for hours with no discomfort. Having the psvr first really was a bad idea, since I compare it to this dumpster garbage. This thing is a huge piece of junk. The only reason I am keeping it, is because of fallout 4, and my friend has one. I hate how they forced me to do that.I asked on one of their forums nicely, why they choose to use these seriously inferior lenses, and design, and they banned me.

As someone who recently purchase this direct from Vive... here's my first impressions:1.) It does take some time to set up.  Google some articles and/or videos to see how its done.  watch their own setup videos a couple of time first.2.) I am running a i7-2600k w/ 8GB RAM and a GTX 1080 card.  Performance is perfect.3.) The videos of the games you see using the HTC Vive is NOT the same thing.  Your resolution and overall graphics quality is not that great when looking into the headset.  (Think graphics technology before anti-aliasing came out)4.) So... no anti-aliasing.  Back to having jaggies.  This isn't an issue for games developed specifically for the HTC Vive, knowing the Vive's graphics limitations.5.) The headset is rather large and because it completely encloses your face, you get a little sweaty6.) the angle of the headset seems to have to sit rather low to get a decent view of the lenses.  Adjusting it takes some time to get the right focus in view.7.) Some games REQUIRE a fairly large open area to walk around in.  So you should ideally have a good 10x10 room with no obstructions.8.) DON'T play this drunk or tired.  I've already had someone fall and nearly busted the equipment because of their clumsiness.9.) Getting headphones to work, and finding the right ones is difficult.10.) the wire coming out the back constantly gets wound upI play this mostly for racing sims.  Because of the lower quality graphics, it's difficult to play.  It's like you're playing on a computer from early 2000.  There is a way to increase the multisampling rate, but it causes some framerate issues when you are moving your head.If you can afford to buy this and have a computer with at least the same specs or better than I have, then get it.  The ability to walk around and use the tracking controllers is absolutely amazing!!!This technology is comparable to the first time you went to 3D movie at the IMax theater.There

I absolutely love mine, great performance(keep in mind you DO need PC hardware that can support it(not a cheap investment)), doesn't get hot(also important), and isn't nearly as heavy as I anticipated. I will agree with others in saying that you shouldn't buy it on here, purely because of the $400+ markup with it. Official retailers include: HTC(Direct), Gamestop(Typically sold out), and the Microsoft Store(Where I got mine)The controller battery life lasts you about a day of fairly active use, which isn't too much of a problem. Just be sure to wear your wriststraps are replacement controllers are $130~.Please measure your play area first, lots of people get upset that they can't play because the area is too small. For the price of $800 you should check your area first. SteamVR allows you to use a smaller space, but they strongly advise against it so please keep this in mind.Otherwise this device is absolutely great(I persuaded two of my friends to go out and get it for themselves) and I am hoping to see more titles made for VR in the future(Already a ton of great ones available on Steam). Definitely worth it as long as you have a graphics card that can support it.

Like the header says don't even consider getting this not even as your first VR headset. Get the Pimax 8K/5K+ instead. It has a wider FOV, non existent SDE, and higher resolutions with way more clarity. They will be available for preorder in October and will ship out in March/May. They are truly generation 2 headsets. The 8K will be $799 for the headset and base stations. There is no confirmed price for the 5K+ yet. If you want a really in-depth review watch SweVivers review.

2 stars because one of the controllers began to bug out every time I pressed the trigger made games like onward and H3VR or anything that required accuracy unplayable. The accuracy of the controller began to degrade within a couple days of gentle use, you will have times where you might gently bump both controllers together because the sensors are just too big its literally unavoidable and that might just be enough to break them...Headset and sensors work fine but I worry for the longevity and quality of this product, buy at your own risk.

Set up was easy, I followed HTC website video on how to set it up.

I bought from a MS Store. The Vive? Amazing.Now that the HTC is selling directly from Amazon, you can pay a good price here.After some setup (and some customization on your PC), you will taste the future.Just be careful: it needs a good Graphic Card Unit (GPU) and processor. I have a RX 480 and an i7 3770 and some say it's the bare minimum, but you can run with some inferior specs. But the better the hardware, the nicer the experience.IMHO Holopoint, Space Pirate Trainer and Vanishing Realms are the best games. For online, Rec Room's paint ball is amazing.

The best peripheral for the PC ever.  Vive uses roomscale and tracked controllers for the most immersive form of VR.  If you've tried Cardboard or Gear VR and thought it was nice, but not much to involve you in the world, the Vive changes all that and lets you interact with the world you're in by holding, grabbing, aiming, swinging, walking around in, looking around, over, and under objects.

Yes, you will have to spend around 1k$ for a PC capable of running VR smooth, yes, you will need to have at least 9x9 feet space to enjoy room-scale, but I've owned this thing for around 5 month and even though most of the games are indy-projects I haven't played a single TV game since.

This is a really good VR headset. The VR controllers allows for creating immersive room scale games and both headset and controllers are very responsive. This is generally a very good product.The only slight disadvantage this product has is that HTC is not providing a very good level of service on the product. For most people, this won't be a problem, but if you are one of the few unfortunate customers who need to have the product repaired, prepare to struggle with HTC as they either reject your requests for repairs or charge you a large amount of money to repair the product.

The HTC Vive is by far one of the most amazing devices I have ever used!! I'm not an avid gamer, never owned a PC before this but after countless research, watching you tube videos, and Reading articles I decided I really wanted to get a Vive.1)Setup:  It's not as bad as everyone is making it out to be!!! I laid everything out and carefully took my time and I would say I had it up and running in around 40 minutes.  YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOUNT the BASESTATIONS!! I have young kids so since in my family room I have to put everything away when I am done.  I bought tripod stands for $20 on Amazon and they work perfectly!!!!2)Experience: I will never be able to put into words the first time I put the headset on and entered the world of VR.  The tutorial had me in awe and I caught myself saying this is amazing at least 15 times!!!  As you start playing the games or trying any of the experiences for the Vive its just an awesome time and so much fun!!! (In some instances pretty scary!!!!)  The picture is really good in my opinion and the Field of View is also good in my opinion.  Anywhere you look you are in the game.  Truly Breathtaking!!!3)Hardware:  The headset is a little bulky but I've been using now for a couple weeks and have used it for hours at a time and never felt like I needed a break or had to take it off.  The cord is really long which is great if you have the room for it but you can get tangled up in it when you start getting into some of those extremely immersive games!! I do hope for a cordless system but in my opinion it does not take away from the awesomeness of this product.4)Computer:  I ended up buying a Syber Vapor Elite which is actually a small compact PC (shaped like a bigger game console).  Like I said earlier I never had a PC and am only using this for the Vive so I hooked up to my 4k TV and can tuck this PC to the side when I'm not using it.  I have i7-6700 and GTX 1070 and it works Flawlessly!!!Final Notes: I hope this review helps anyone who is researching or thinking about the Vive. These were all things I was looking into during my research of the Vive.  It is such a fun and awesome experience and am extremely happy with my purchase!!!!  If anyone does purchase make sure to try The Blu, Hoverjunkers, The Visitor (quite scary), HordeZ, I can keep going but these are some of my favorite.

When I purchased the VIVE I did so reluctantly. After months of consideration and constant checking of articles, reviews, and videos I decided that I would just dive head first and see what happens. What I got was a lot better than I had anticipated and surprised me immensely, the graphics, open room movement and tracking are completely overwhelming. Luckily I had built a PC earlier on this year so I wasn't worried about system requirements but they are pretty hefty if you don't know too much about owning a computer.The only major downside that I've seen so far is that there still aren't any major groundbreaking games that make VR to die for just yet.

This is an expensive item period. As such I was expecting quality, but no, controllers don't sync correctly, my movements aren't tracked well, the headset is large and cumbersome, the controllers are not as intuitive as HTC would like you to believe, and the support for this is laughable, as in they just laugh at you. Traded it in for an Oculus and well, I'm happier. Plus I got more games with the extra $250. Its not really much of a difference not sure why its so much more expensive.

I've been gaming since I was a little kid and have thought the medium had grown stale and kinda at that point where there was nowhere left to go... Then I bought one of these this last week...CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER!Take everything you know about immersion and visualization in gaming and throw in Neo's first moments in the dojo scene of the Matrix and you've described what it's like to believe when you play this headset. In one moment I'm playing on a spaceport platform getting shot at at drones in slow motion while I fend off their hordes with guns and shields... And I move my body to move my character... I've NEVER been athletic with my gaming except the DDR days or some stupid Kinect or Wii gimmick, but this was a new sense of activeness I had achieved. Then I bought a ping pong game and a table manifested in my room and I was in the middle of a tournament where I was playing against a pixel 90's throwback like Wreck-It Ralph and the physics were perfect. Oh yeah, and there is so much free content and demonstrations that are so superior to any demo you've ever played on a regular PC game or console game... I mean at one point I was simply playing the Table Top Simulator game and was in the middle of the park playing chess with other people and moving my pieces with the virtual wands that come with the device... I could lean into the table and analyze every move of my opponent like I was in front of a real table playing chess. Then I started talking with other people in the room debating the need to own this headset. Just awesome.Granted I also just bought a very expensive gaming rig to play this and have the disposable income to enjoy it in it's glory, but all I'll say is if you have the money and the time... Buy/build the nicest PC you can and just do it. Buy this. Don't even think about it.As a quick side note, the headset didn't work at first plugging the hdmi cord into a motherboard port on my computer. You have to plug it into the graphic's card port itself. This is especially true with the GTX 1080 card I have for this. I had to buy a HDMI/Display Port adapter to free up the graphic's card HDMI port. The machine was absolutely useless and didn't work until I did my research and found this out. Worked like a charm when I had the hdmi port free. Got the adapter from best buy. Going to see if there's a better one on Amazon.

This product is not ready for the average consumer in any way, shape or form. First of all, after purchasing this product you will need to also purchase a brand new top-of-the-line graphics card. Assuming you did that or you already have it, you can still expect an immense amount of problems whenever you attempt you use it. Even if everything is connected perfectly your PC will repeatedly return ""headset not found"" errors and you'll be left to diagnose the problems while connecting and disconnecting cables and rebooting your computer. Whenever it does work, the product offerings will be slim because most programming and games are still not made for VR.I'm sure the next model will do what people expect from VR. This one is more for tech enthusiasts who like to tinker with beta-release tech. Avoid this product if you don't have many many hours to dedicate to making it work. To me this is mostly the most expensive and bulky paperweight I ever bought.

It only took 20 minutes to setup, and I didn't bother drilling holes for the sensors (lighthouses), I just put one on top of shelf, and the other one I fixed onto the an old tripod I had lying around.The games, and sense of immersion, of not just playing videogames but being part of them, is just amazing. I have lost many many hours to tiltbrush and Elite Dangerous...I'm having almost as much fun showing friends and family, who have never tried VR before. The looks on their faces when they take the headset off is just priceless! It's  turned into a very social thing, as I often have friends wanting to come over to see it, or come back to play more, most weekends now. For me, it's worth the cost of the headset just for that alone!

Got mine at a local electronics store because to be honest, I wanted to be able to return it quickly if it wasn't worth the price. I have owned both a Rift and original Vive. So let me keep this short and sweet. Compared to both of those headsets for general use the resolution bump is nice for reading text and seeing far off objects more clearly. Comfort is also improved and an improved nose saddle to reduce light leaking in. Audio is not improved however. It sounds almost identical to the original Vive. The Mic is slightly improved. I believe there are 2 mics vs the 1 on the original Vive. Fidelity seems better. So basically its an impovment over the original VIve and Oculus headsets in small tweeks and a slight improvement in resolution.But...Here is where things start to take a turn.. First off and as the title of this basic review say, the glare through the lenses, sometimes refereed to as ""God Rays"" are noticeably worse then the original Vive and Oculus rift which is a huge deal breaker for me. Its like staring at shiny objects that reflect the sun directly into your eyes. As you shift your view inside the headset, which of course is unavoidable, you get really bad glare constantly. I thought it was bad enough in the original Vive and Oculus but somehow HTC has actually made it worse. You can try to re-adjust the headset on your head which temporarily helps but as the headset settles into its natural position on your skull they quickly come back. To me this makes the entire experience of VR pointless. Constantly having to remove yourself from the immersion to adjust your headset over and over only to have the problem keep coming back is a huge disappointment. Obviously the price is also a major factor as well. You get no controllers, and no base station. So if you are new to VR, not upgrading from the original Vive you will have to drop even more money for the full intended experience. I feel that the Vive Pro as a stand alone product is a horrible value. It seems to be targeting original Vive owners exclusively. To me price vs value is way off here and I do NOT recommend getting this as your first VR headset. If you are dead set on experiencing VR you can spend several hundred less and get a Oculus Rift or original Vive package which will come with everything you need to get started. After about a weeks of use I was pretty much done with this as content is still lacking and the ""improvements"" simply did not warrant the cost.

I've been active in the VR community since late 2013 when I first demoed the Oculus Crystal Cove prototype. Bought a DK2 in mid 2014 and used it for everything I could find, which wasn't much at the time.Cut to this year. I pre-ordered my Vive the minute orders went live, received it mid April and have been playing it daily ever since! I've had ZERO problems with the Vive. I log into SteamVR, put on the HMD, turn on the controllers and everything just works every time. My space is around 8' x 10' and it's more than enough room to enjoy 99% of the games out there right now. Many of the games allow for standing or seated gameplay too so you DON'T need a dedicated room for the Vive. Don't believe the negative spin put out there by the Oculus crowd.The games are getting bigger and better almost daily. Right now I have 63 items in my library. Many are demos or short cool experiences, some are arcade style games (a blast in VR!), and about 20 titles are full, polished games. This list is growing FAST, last week there was 250 different experiences to download and play, next week that number will be even greater. The Steam community of content developers is enormous and there are always new things to download and experience (often for free).Compared to the Oculus DK2, The HTC Vive is a true next gen advancement in VR. The optics are clear and though the SDE is still there in ALL current VR headsets (including the Oculus Rift), it's been greatly reduced so it's not even noticeable when playing. The Vive's handling of spatial audio is spot on accurate as is the tracking of the head mounted display and controllers, thanks to the sub mm laser precision (literally, lasers) of Vive's Lighthouse base stations.Vive controllers: As soon as you hold a pair of tracked controllers in VR you immediately find yourself touching the world around you. You're no longer a passive observer, you become an active participant in virtual reality and s*** gets real! Ray gun, flashlight, hands, sword, shield, lightsabers (!!!), anything you can hold in life (or fantasy) you can now physically hold and manipulate in VR thanks to these incredible controllers!

I didn't buy it from Amazon.  I bought it from the HTC website.  I am pretty much coming hear to rant about it.  It looks nice, it is incredibly immersive, but it is unusable.  At first one of the controllers only worked if it was plugged in.  After awhile just cease to work.  Now it won't even detect the controllers and the support is useless.  The instruction manual shows you how to pair the controllers.  That didn't work, all it did was blink a blue light until it said ""no controller detected"".  Their support page give you a link to a troubleshooting page on Steam.  All that was on there is instructions on how to pair the controllers.  I contacted support and they gave me detailed instructions on how to pair your controller.  After that I told them that didn't work, they told me to uninstall the program and reinstall.  Guess what that didn't work. Now I have an $800 paperweight.

Super excited waiting for my Vive to arrive only to be super frustrated by over 7 hours feeling lost/ setting it up. Finally got it to work for a week and now the headset does not power on. AVOID HTC SUPPORT. They took 11 DAYS to respond to my email for support. The email I did receive was confusing and unhelpful.

First off, you should know that this requires a very powerful gaming PC. Minimum requirements for many games include a $500+ video card. Secondly, I was given this as a gift and it totally amazes me and everyone that wears it. Totally changes your perspective of what gaming is. It feels like a $2 million simulator! It's funny looking at the kids trying to grab stuff without the controllers, and looking around with that kind of excitement that you remember having when you first played video games. The first game I bought was Onward, which is looking to be what Counter-Strike used to be back in the days. It's instantly addictive, and you spend your gaming hours actually moving! Would highly recommend even if just for this game.

The HTC Vive is probably the most fascinating technology product I've ever bought. It exploits the possibilities of virtual reality better than any competitor. The immersion is almost perfect because of:1. The representation of your hands in VR with the Vive Controllers2. Room Scale Tracking which monitors your movements to all angles within a defined space (I use an area of 8 x 7 feet - should not be less).Prior to the Vive I bought a Samsung Gear VR and the Oculus Rift CV1. It is great fun but VR should not be limited to watching videos and playing with a gamepad while sitting on a chair.At first I realised this when playing the great but unfortunately short mountaineering experience ""Everest VR"" with the Vive. You can't climb the Everest on your butt. Only if you are in the game with the full representation of your body you do get the impression that it's finally real. A few weeks later I bought the tactical shooter ""Onward"" for the Vive and it literally blew my mind. When seeking cover behind walls kneeling down and hearing the bullets coming from all directions your living room does become a battlefield. it is so realistic that it scares you. Common gaming monitors - whether in 4K or 8K - will never be able to suck you in this deep.Premium content like the latter for the Vive is already there on steam but it's rare. However, the hardware is ready for a VR decade and no later than when Bethesda (Doom and Fallout VR confirmed) will get their AAA stuff ready the Vive will get the recognition it deserves.

I've been gaming for over 30 years and there has been nothing quite like the wow factor that you can experience when you put on the helmet and are able to literally walk around in a virtual world. It's not perfect. You need a really fast processor and video card to run it. The software is sometimes annoying. But, honestly, that's all worth it for what this is able to deliver.

I pre-ordered the Vive about a year ago, and it is the best piece of tech I have ever owned.  It's a shame is that there is really no way to know just how it feels or how awesome it is by looking at specification sheets, or even review videos.  There is no way to experience that sense of scale, depth, the emotional response to quite literally BEING (or so your brain thinks) inside these worlds.  You just need to take the reviews word for it.Some people prefer the Rift, and admittedly that would be a better choice for a select few people.  But there really is no question that this headset is where it's at.

HTC Vive proves that virtual reality is here to stay. I was extremely skeptical having tried an early developer version of Oculus. The Vive fixes most, if not all of the issues earlier devices have.[Initial Setup]Right out of the box are clear directions on how to get everything setup. You're walked through each step which is explained is really easy to follow English. You will be tempted to just get it setup as fast as you can so you can enter the virtual world. Resist those urges, you will have a much better experience if your lighthouses are setup correctly first. I made the mistake of trying to set them up on boxes as a stop gap until I had some light stands to mount them to (even better is wall mounting, something I can't do in an apartment).[First Run]When you finally get everything setup you're taken into a tutorial ""game"" that shows you how to use the controllers and navigate around in room scale. Whats really cool is how intuitive everything is. You don't really have to think about what you're doing on the controller because a virtual controller that follows your hands is shown. You very quickly forget you're even wearing a headset. You might notice the first time you put it on that the pixels are visible. This is called the screen door effect and there's not really any solution for it yet. You'll get used to it pretty quickly. Some games like Job Simulator do a good job of hiding it by use of a cartoon art style. Games that use more realistic textures make the screen door effect more noticeable.[A few hours in]You'll be sweating like crazy after a couple hours. This is normal and a sign you were having a good time. Right about now you might be thinking how gross it is to have a foam band that just absorbed all your sweat. Good news! You can hand wash the foam. Directions are included on how to do that. (There's also an extra thrown in for people with different sized faces).[The Headset]The headset has a few adjustments you should take note of. They're not all that clear in the documentation. There's a little turn knob on the side that lets you adjust the IPD. HIGHLY suggest doing this as it will make the image as crisp as possible. Unfortunately it bottoms out around 60mm. You can pull out on the sides where it says Vive and rotate to adjust the distance from your face, leaving space for glasses. Most obviously is the elastic straps, pretty straight forward. Best way to get the fit right is to loosen up before placing it on your head and tightening up once its over your eyes. You don't want to overly stretch the elastic out.Overall this is an excelling first generation device that really proves virtual reality is finally here. Find a store that has them for demo. Try it out. You will need a beefy computer to play anything at a decent frame rate. So far that's the only downside thats not limited by technology. Total cost can well exceed 2k.

Well, it does marginally improve the resolution from the original vive but it just isn't worth the very steep price.  While there have been some adjustments in weight distribution, I think the biggest comfort upgrade comes from a wider face pad than what comes with the original vive.  The original vive with the audio strap upgrade and aftermarket face pad is more comfortable than the pro in my opinion.  There seems to be an issue with the sound, I can't identify the issue....it has some static and periodic drops in fidelity, I've seen post of others experiencing these issues also.  Even though this has about 75% more pixels, it dosn't translate to even 15% clearer images.  I thought this would be a worthy upgrade to my original vive considering I use it daily, but really I just want my money back...Serious buyers remorse on this one, the original is fine for today's VR applications.

Owned one a few months now and absolutely love it. Like having my own personal interactive Disneyland in my living room. So excited to see where the technology goes from here. Most games right now are more ""experiences"" than games, but that's because they're the best example of what the Vive does better than any other platform I've used. It's fun to just let a well-made world wash over you and feel like you're a part of it.That being said there are already some pretty darn fun games so it can only get better from here!

Any review of the vive, or the rift is not complete if you don't compare one to another.  I was luck enough to have both and I can say that the experience using the vive is in another universe compared to the rift.  VR needs to have touch there is no way around it, you can have an excellent headset, with superb optics but without the touch controllers you do not have a system.  I understand the reasons why Oculus decided to wait, but the vive killed them with the controllers.  The immersive experience with the vive is in another realm altogether with the controllers.  the setup with the vive is not that hard, before I got my system I did some reading, and basically the issue is where you are going to put the lighthouses.  I have not drilled, I have then on two ""go pro"" stands I got from amazon at chest level and I get perfect tracking.  I will drill eventually to have them higher.  The current games are great and that brings me to another point.  The store.... I do not understand for the life of me why Oculus would limit where we save our games, with the steam store is easy.  I think that when oculus brings their controllers the experience will be the same, what I don't understand is will they need another tracking camera ? Yet another expense ? No thanks, I will stay with the complete current system.

UPDATE:  My wife is authorizing a new PC and Vive purchase so that she can use the HTC Vive to teach my son about science, and so that she can play whenever she wants.This system is great and DOES NOT cost as much as it is listed for by the third party sellers.My wife loves the Vive, even when she had a bad experience with motion sickness with the Rift DK2.  She was able to play for four hours on her very first session without any ill effects.  The room scale VR is awesome!  My wife and I have tried to put the controllers down but on a virtual desk.  Dodging the enemy blaster bullets in Space Pirate Trainer is exhilarating, and the Zombies are truly scary in VR, watch out!  To date, I have hosted three different VR / Tech Parties at my house, all of which the friends that attended left wanting a Vive of their own.  I feel like I am there when I am playing games, looking at art, or traveling to the Moon.PROs:1) With minimal knowledge on how to hang pictures and organize furniture, one can set up the Vive for room scale.2) The equipment is very durable, made by an electronics manufacturer that makes great quality hardware.3) Designed and Developed by a Game and Software creator and distribution company that provides an extensive selection of VR Material.4) The resolution is great (1200x1080 @ 90Hz per eye) for a Head Mounted Display that is less than 3"" from your face.5) The fit is easily adjustable for anyone to wear.  The system takes about three minutes to adjust from one person to another.6) The controllers are comfortable and represent 1:1 movements. I was able to throw and catch them while in VR, and can identify their location well enough to pick them up without removing the HMD.CONs:1) The price point is a little high, but it will most likely beat the Oculus Rift in price for room scale VR.2) The comfort level diminishes when playing more than 3-4 hours due to the head straps.  The pressure exerted will cause you to feel slight discomfort if worn for too long.3) The screens in the HMD need a way to adjust brightness.  These screens are, however, significantly brighter than the Oculus Rift screens (allowing for more detail).Mike OUT​

Edit:Update: So after countless mistakes made by the HTC support team and some serious headaches, I finally got back my headset about a month ago. Less than a month later, the vive is not tracking properly and once again I'm having to deal with the exact same nightmares.I still recommend that you DO NOT PURCHASE THIS garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I purchased the vive about 6 months ago, this week it started encountering an issue in which the vive itself is recognized by my system, but not the base stations. Contacted support, spent several hours debugging (on top of the debugging I spent myself prior to getting on a live chat). They finally escalated the case, and eventually decided the headset needed to be sent in for repair. The rep informed me an email with shipping information and everything would be sent in about an hour. Next day, nothing, following day I contacted them and they had lost case notes as well as tried sending me another customer's RMA information (could have screwed me if I had used that to send in my headset). In short, their support team is absolutely garbage, which is very sad given the product is so expensive. There is also a lack of games, the only one thus far thats really fun is Onward in my opinion. I recommend holding off or possibly trying the occulus. Also note, the ""supervisor"" I was working with in a recent chat, kept asking about warranty information such as when, where, how I purchased it. They really want to get you for whatever they can. ""Jet:I wish we can have the copy of receipt so we can proceed easier. Me: How the heck would that proceed easier? Jet:7:18 PM Having the proof of purchase can of course back us up with the warranty claim.""Save your self the headache, DO NOT purchase this. Once its breaks, they have no ambition to retain customers! Also, look at how often things just goes wrong with the initial setup. I've tried helping several people due to some of the poor design flaws.I'm still on a chat session with a so called supervisor, whom has the highest authority for their support team (utter BS). I cannot stress over how terrible support is and how screwed you are if your system goes bad. Mine is still under warranty and I'm going through such a difficult time getting them to assist.

Got the Vive for Christmas at the end of 2016.Loved  it until 1 year and 2 months after getting it when one of my base stations stopped working with Fault 03. Google it- this is EXTREMELY common and often happens within months of getting it. Or anytime they push an update,Now, Since I'm just out of warranty, I'm going to have to buy another one at $134 or else the system which cost $799 1 year ago will be useless. The base station has been in the same spot since I first installed it and has not been moved or damaged.This equipment is not ready for prime time- save your self the headache and a TON of money and wait for something with better equipment.

I've never spent so much money on a single product before and i was really nervous as soon as i confirmed my order. Had i just made an $800 mistake?Nope, I couldn't be happier with the Vive, my room is just big enough for the small play area and i have so much fun with it whenever I have time to play it! I only have so much free time but even still I'll never regret buying my Vive, and it's only getting better with time!

Its a great product if you actually get a working device.  The triple cable that came with it is faulty.  Was working some of the time, but kept getting error 208.  Once I figured out it was the cable, I sent off to HTC Vive support.  I hope you don't have to deal with their support, its horrible.  You two options, email them and not even get a confirmation the email went through, or live chat in a 2005 circa irc chat box which sometimes disconnects.Details:  I initiated a support ticket on the 9th, sent them the cable which was received by someone on the 13th and my case has not been updated.  My course of action including a follow up chat box and my 2nd email ( neither email being responded to).  Its now the 22nd and I'm now going to attempt a make shift cable setup using a very long HDMI cable, a very long USB cable and hopefully a power adapter with a long cable as well that hopefully fits.I know this is first generation tech, but that is exactly why you have to have great support going in.  This has been such a clown show.

This thing is absolutely fantastic. This is real VR. Phone VR and Oculus rift VR simply does not provide an experience like the HTC Vive. Sure Oculus has tracked controllers coming but they're not here yet. The HTC vive puts you into virtual environments. Want to pick something up reach out and grab it. If you have a computer that can power VR get the HTC Vive it's a complete game changer.

BE WARNED: The HTC Vive controllers have a known flaw & will fail almost immediately. I purchased the HTC Vive locally, contacted HTC when my controller became defective after just a week. Customer care said it’d be much faster to return & pickup a new system, because sending the controller in for repairs would take several weeks. I returned the unit & within a week, the same issue occurred, but this time it affected both controllers. Bottom-line, is the controllers are poorly constructed & based on my experience are defective.

Guys, HTC support is absolutely the worst on the planet. Be warned that if your unit is defective, they will NOT replace it. You must pay to ship it back to them for repair only. You will also spend hours on the phone only to get disconnected constantly. Before buying it, PLEASE search the web for HTC Vive Support and see for yourself the horror stories about HTC support. Most end up with an $800 brick.

I just wanted to let everyone know that if you have a GTX-970 video card like I do, and are currently using the HDMI port for your monitor, you will not have an extra HDMI port that the VIVE needs to connect to. Luckily I had a ""HDMI Female to DVI-D Male Video Adapter"" on hand which I used to connect my monitor to which left my HDMI port open on my video card for the VIVE to use. Hope this saves someone the headache that it would eventually cause if you're not prepared.The HTC VIVE is the best device I've had in years. Its so much fun. It's an experience that can't be explained. You have to experience it for yourself to fully understand. Can't wait to see what the next generation will bring.

When it works it's amazing.  However after spending 800 dollars for the unit, another 100 dollars for the deluxe audio strap, one of the base stations had a laser fail after about 20-30 hours of actual use.  That 20-30 hours fell shortly after the warranty period has expired.  HTC's suggestion to fix the problem is tojust buy a new base station.  I've enjoyed my experiences with VR, but I don't think I'm willing to drop another 135 dollars to keep playing.  I know this isn't the most surprising suggestion from a company, but be warned that it won't be the new version of VR that makes your system obsolete, it will be early hardware failure.

You seriously cannot begin to describe this. So immersive that you'll find yourself trusting things with your eyes that you probably shouldn't. It truly has breathtaking sights to behold. Most of the games through steam are relatively cheap and many more offer free trials.

This is an ok headset probably #4/6 of what’s out there rt now.  It’s uncomfortable, it’s sensors work most of the time, it’s handles are a bit quirky, it’s heavy and ugly (in my opinion) But for what’s out there  - if you don’t look at “price” it falls in just behind the oculus.  The new mixed reality headsets have beter resolution and with vr that - with comfort are key.  There all going to have some workaround to play each others games.  So In the end you want good controllers, comfortable headset (with high resolution and ease of use).  This is a good product around $300 over that any of the mixed reality headsets pull ahead.  The older sensors and lower resolution makes this worth no more than $300.  To be honest I wouldn’t buy it for that I’d get oculus or one of the 6 mixed reality sets with higher res and better tracking solution.  I like my Vive but it’s the weakest of my three and most expensive.  I do think the Vive Pro at $499 for what’s out there now would make sense.  (If you like the free stuff that comes with it) if not go look at the Samsung it’s probably the best for the money right now.  $349 high res and great controls.  Gl

Setup is something you need to prepare for and make sure you have all the cables.  IF video card does not have 2 HDMI ports then you must come up with an alternate way to hook to monitor, and VIVE.  Games, well to be quite frank the games right now suck.  The best one I have played is a 5 minute starwars lightsaber thing, and THE LAB.  Both are more like tech demos.  Vanishing realms will be decent but its nowhere near finished.  Haven't played hover junkers but it looks promising.  Most games are like 85% of indie games...Crap.  The experience this thing is capable of is AWESOME, but we just don't have the software to match the hardware.  Other negatives are pixelated/screen door effect which isn't as significant a jump from the Samsung Gear VR that I hoped it would be.UPDATE: 9/24/2016Still not much in the way of software and I would still recommend staying away for now until STEAM/HTC actually support some 800 dollar device worthy software.  That probably isn't until next year.  To be honest unless you have to be on the bleeding edge I would wait until HTC VIVE 2 comes out.  I did notice that the screen door effect varies from game to game, and even pixilation, with this in mind it is a bigger step forward over the GEAR VR then I originally posted, however this is a device still NOT worth buying yet.UPDATE: 10/07/2016With the release of Viveport I was excited to come on here and comment how well the software is doing, however if I did that I would be lying.  Software is still mediocre at best, the viveport has titles that don't even download properly, most are still gimmicky or poorly developed, or in some cases partially finished.  More and more I am starting to believe I should have bought an Occulus Rift from looking at their store the support seems significantly better, even PlayStation VR has exculsives, and real AAA titles things the HTC VIVE sorely lacks.  Either don't buy this or wait is my suggestion.

HTC customer service and inventory management system is non-existentOrder doesn't show up, esp. if you login to their website using OAuth provider like facebook.Return and repair has to be initiated manually, and shipping paid for by customer. They don't even track your shipment back, in my case I thought they lost my RMA because they contacted me for not getting the controller. A month later, the controller came back - repaired, except I already bought a spare in all of the excitement.I told the rep that here in U.S. return is usually a no frill affair within the first 30 days.  Please NOTE: return to HTC is anything but... they manually review, and you have to plead through chat in order to get the RMA.Good product, but poor customer service experience. Also quality control appears to be spotty, my Vive shipped with broken D-Pad. Most games don't need it, which's why it took me so long to resolve.

I recently bought the HTC VIVE as a joint birthday present for my wife and kid.  Their birthdays were super close together and doing it as a joint present was the only way I could justify the cost.  The present was a definite win.  Everything with the setup was relatively smooth when following the directions, though the drywall mounting screws for the base stations were poor.  I would recommend finding an alternative.My problems started a day after setup when handing the VR Headset between players and holding it by the headstrap.  There's an internal bracket on the side of the headset that the headstrap buckle attaches to and it just fell into two pieces and the headstrap came off.  I don't know why they didn't use a metal bracket, but assume that the one on mine was defective and likely cracked during assembly.  I panicked a bit of course, but this was an obviously defective product so I should be able to work with HTC through the return process.Their customer support process is awful!  For the HTC, they only have chat support available.  I don't know how many simultaneous chats a support agent has open at any one time, but the latency is about 30 seconds between each line of text.  This means that for a simple problem, like initiating a replacement, I spent multiple HOURS over multiple days just describing the issue, what happened, documenting the problem with pictures before the return process was initiated.With that process done, I thought that was the end of my problems.  Even after a return was initiated, it takes 1-2 days to get a return label.  Or so they say.  It takes 1-2 days to get an email saying that they have started the return process and that you need wait another 3 business days to actually receive the return label.  3 more business days puts it over the weekend so it's really 5 days.  Add in the shipping time to their warehouse, the time spent on support and the resolution is adding up to weeks.Is that the end of the process?  Of course not.  It was delivered to the warehouse two weeks ago and no movement towards sending me a replacement has been made.  We go through the painful chat support process to check on the status several times a week.  There is nothing they do but ask us to wait.  They don't even seem to be able to contact the warehouse to check on it.  I can't call anyone to help.  The agents can't escalate to anyone with any authority.  UGH!!I'm a month into customer support hell and I can't get out.  I dread that something technical (rather than just a manufacturing issue) comes up with the device if I ever do get it back.  I played it once and it was really fun, but at this point I would recommend looking into a competitor's product rather than playing russian roulette with your $800 with a company that doesn't even have a process in place to try and support your purchase.

I bought this with high expectations, but it has a few problems. First off, the headset wouldn't recognize the controllers. I turned it off and on maybe 15 times, and it only detected the controllers twice. So it told me to pair the controllers with the headset, when I did this, it told me that it couldn't detect the controller. Secondly, the screen door effect was a distraction, and the video was not clear at all. It was really grainy and not really focused. Third, my base stations had a firmware update, and everytime I tried to update them, they would lock up my computer and not do anything. I had to keep manually powering down my computer, and then restarting it. Finally in the end, I just packed it all back in the box, and sent it back for a refund. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.

The vive is so much fun, I ordered mine from Amazon prime for $799. Family and friends have been over to check it out and everyone can't get enough of it. Plus there is much cool content for it already. A few of my favorite games are tilt brush, the Blu, the lab from steam, space pirate trainer, out of ammo...

Pros- Immersive: You see a table in-game you'll want to set the controllers down on them but you can't. You naturally avoid cliffs and walls even though you can go through them.- Potential: See the robot repair and slingshot demo to see how immersive games can be. Unfortunately everything feels like a small demo. It's the first version of this technology so I'm glad they released it to get support but I'm eagerly awaiting V2 since the cons are too strong.Cons- Resolution: You can see the individual colors that make up the pixels- Blurry: Only text at the center of the screen is clear for me and I've tried every possible headset adjustment to fix it- Field of view: You see black circles around your vision and it's very noticeable until you become really immersed in what you're doing- Camera: Hidden feature and can mess with your tracking if your USB port isn't good enough- Lighthouses: They don't turn off automatically when you're not using the headset (there is a setting to turn them off when you shutdown steam manually)- Heavy: There's no airflow in the headset so you will sweat if you're playing a game where you're moving around a lot- Cord: Heavy and can ruin immersion when you get tied up in it- Headphones: It's an annoying process to put the headphones in each time you put the headset on; especially distinguishing between left and right- Games: There are only small demos right now

Cannot install the Bluetooth device which one of his job is to turn off the sensors while not in use. The sensors has no switch so I have to disconnect them everytime I don't use the vive. I googled it To try solve the problem and saw that many people complain about the same issue. I called htc support and they blame Microsoft, steam and dell ( I have brand new Alienware) but didn't give me any solution. What a shame for 800$! Will return and buy the new oculus touch package. Better and now with the new price tag is about 200$ less...never htc anymore....first and last!

My family and I have enjoyed our overall experience with the VIVE.  Games are scarce, but they are pretty cheap.  Most games feel like demos of future games or don't really have any point other than to showcase what it can do.HOWEVER....Good luck if you need to contact customer service!  The velcro strap on mine broke on day 2 of ownership... I contacted HTC for help (through the chat).... the person I got acted like he was really having to call in some favors to get the strap replaced for me... You can't buy replacement straps yet.... don't know if you will be able to in the future....So, he agreed, after I submitted pictures of the rip etc, to send me a new one.  HTC required I send them the broken one first.... and once it arrived, they would send out a new one... This would mean I wouldn't be able to use my vive for 2 weeks, minimum, while these straps are in transit.  I've never heard of anything so petty.  I told them to send to me the new one and I would send the faulty one back after the new one arrived.... They told me that they would not do that.... So, here I am, an early adopter, dropping over 800 bucks on one of their products, which breaks after 2 days..... and they expect me to make concessions?  I see why people are giving poor reviews for customer service... They certainly aren't putting the customer first....UPDATE:  HTC still does not offer replacement straps, but I have to say, we love it anyway.  The velcro on mine is being held together with crazy glue.  It's VR the way (if you grew up in the 80's and 90's) you always hoped it would be.  Some games make your brain really believe you are there.  Monsters can be terrifying, and the jump scares are intense.  Highly recommend... my experience with the strap and customer service notwithstanding.

*Just like to put a few things out there before starting my review. First thing, don't buy this for the inflated price from third party sellers trying to make a buck on amazon. Go to the HTC Vive website and but it directly from the manufacturer. Second thing, I didn't buy it for myself I bought it for my husband. :)I tried this out I have to say I wasn't impressed with the experience. The graphics from the games didn't really give make me feel like I was 'immersed' in a virtual reality world. Some of the games made me feel like I was playing my old Nintendo 64 on our old tube TV, but instead of being a kid and impressed, I'm unimpressed because I'm an adult now and I just spent $1000 (after tax, shipping, and tripods). That's how unspectacular some of these games seemed to me. I got motion sick from using it and I also felt like I was suffocating.The headset was heavy, the images were kinda blurry (I couldn't fit my glasses underneath the headset), and it was hot as hell, lol. Now you can adjust the headset lenses, but I wasn't able to find an optimal setting. The images were still blurry. I don't know if that contributed to my motion sickness or not. The headset has a long cord attached to it and you have to get used to walking around and not being able to see the cord. You do kind of get a 'second sense' after awhile and figure out how to not trip on it.I also find the controllers to be a little awkward. I don't feel very immersed or impressed holding these big ass velociraptor-like claws and swinging them around. I had no problems with the controllers functioning properly or breaking, but I am definitely excited for when the tech advances to gloves and shoes with sensors instead of huge controllers. When you play some of the games you are playing in the 1st person and for example, in the Chair in the Middle of the Room, you can see hands as if you were looking down at your own. However, if you move them out far enough you simply see a floating hand with no arms. Meh.My husband however, has partaken of the Kool-Aid and he thinks it's the 'greatest thing ever.' He enjoys playing it quite a bit. He's the type of person that has to have all the new consoles, technology and etc when they come out. I'm the type of person that is willing to wait for the second version to come out a couple months or a year later that will have more kinks worked out, or hell, at least have a wireless headset.TL;DR version: It's fun, but be aware that the games out right now have meh graphics. My husband is crazy about the mini golf game and I could only think, ""He paid $25(?) for THIS?"" Be sure you have a big enough space to map out your playing field. Research the recommended dimensions on the Vive website and get a tape measure! We had to get rid of a recliner. Do you ever get motion sick playing 1st person games/shooters? I've heard that some people get used to it, but I wasn't impressed enough to find out. Be sure to go through the Steam VR (That's right, I hope you don't mind having Steam!) shop and browse through the games. Some of the games are pretty expensive and some are 'experiences' only, not games. You will be paying $15-$20+ for some games/experiences that don't take very long and don't have much, if any, replay value. Hopefully the tech gets better on the next version so the headset will be wireless and there are gloves and shoes with sensors instead of controllers.Would I buy it again? No. Would I buy it again to get my husband to STFU? Yes, LOL. :)

EDIT*Let me tell you the ugly truth about VR. The resolution could really suck for you. Especially if you are used to 4k monitors or 1440p. Also most of the games for VR don't have impressive graphics. Some even feel like smart phone games. Many games that call themselves ""games"" are really just short virtual experiences .I have an app that lets you sit in an expensive apartment and watch movies and television shows on a 10 foot screen. But the resolution won't be good enough some people. You know those popular projection televisions about 10 years ago? That were about as popular as 4k televisions now and the same price? That is the experience you will get and see overall.So if you are sitting there expecting crystal clear VR and for the games to look the same as on your monitor. I have bad news for you - VR technology isn't there yet. If you are looking to use a desktop APP and use these for reading and general computer use - I have bad news for you the technology isn't there yet either. My honest advice is to wait for the next generation of both the HTC VIVE and Oculus next year. You will get a much better experience. Isn't to say you don't get an amazing experience now - you do, but just with stipulations.It is great piece of tech but keep in mind just for a minute that VR for computers is already a small market. Why? Because you need a really good one - but it is better to have a great one. I build my computers myself and the enthusiast PC builders like me are a niche market. So most people don't have over 1,500 dollars to spend on a PC. Fewer have over 2000 to spend on a PC. Then you throw this thing on and it can get insane.The other issue is space and the reason I sold mine. To be safe you really should have 7 square feet of space. Yes it offers a standing room experience and yes you can play games - along with using apps for it. But many times you can't do that and you feel really restricted. But make no mistake this does turn your room into a holodeck just like Star Trek in many ways.I wish I had an extra room where I can use it as a holodeck but I just don't. As soon as I do I will be getting one of these again (will have it next year) but by then the next generation of VR could get here so I may as well wait for the next HTC VIVE headset version. I will be buying a Oculus Rift instead because it better fits my needs. Not only that but I am having back surgery in the next few months and a headset where I have to stand most of the time won't work for my lifestyle for awhile.The headset wasn't heavy at all for me. But I am also 6'8 inches 300 pounds. The two smaller people who wore it did complain about the weight and say it wasn't all that comfy to wear after awhile.Pros- It turns your PC room into a Holodeck!- Fantastic selection of games and apps- being linked to Steam means you get the best deals on games and apps- no Facebook partnership- Well craftedCons- Can be heavy for smaller users- Need a decent amount of space- Price- If you get hot at all when playing? You will sweat like you are wearing a scuba mask.ConclusionThe HTC VIVE probably* offers the best VR experience you can buy - based on two factors. When I dreamed about VR as a little kid this is what I pictured after watching Lawnmower Man (yes I am damn old). The VIVE is something you have to experience for yourself - it is mind-blowing. Just like I can tell you the Grand Canyon is a hole in the ground but that isn't the same as being there and it doesn't do the experience justice.That being said? It is only the best experience if you have the space needed to get the full experience and you have plenty of cash to blow - is the most expensive retail VR experience out there. If you are right on the bubble going back on forth if your computer can run this at it's best? You are probably better to go with the Oculus Rift and using the money saved to upgrading your computer. If you don't have the space? It is not worth investing in the Vive. Yes there are sitting experiences and standing - but there are simply not enough of them to justify that kind of money.There will be in a year but not now.

Once I worked out the a few quirks my Vive works great. However, I wanted to mention that HTC has the worst support that I have ever experienced.The two issues I needed to solve to get things workign smoothly:1. The HDMI port on my Asus Strix GTX 970 didn't play nice with either the Vive or my Rift. I solved this by using a DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort cable to plug into the Vive's box. On the Rift I had to buy a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter.2. The Vive behaved unreliably and erratically while plugged into my motherboards USB 3 ports. I bought one of these http://smile.amazon.com/Vantec-2-Port-Type-PCIe-UGT-PC370A/dp/B00WT99060?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00 and now it works reliably.I'm a technical person so I was able to overcome these issues on my own. If I was dependent on on HTC support, I would have had no chance to get the Vive working.Now that the Vive works reliably for me, I love it and find two things to be advantages over the Rift:1. It works with Steam. Not everyone loves Steam but I've been a long time Steam customer and I greatly prefer it to the Oculus Home stuff.2. The controllers are an enormous advantage over using an XBox One controller with the Rift. I don't think I can overstate how much of a difference this makes to the overall experience.

What ever you expect virtual reality to be, it's way better!! Seriously I've been a gamer since the inception of games.... Pong. This is completely mind blowing the people jumping in early are simply getting a glimpse at what's to come this is only the beginning, nvidia just announced the ability to dedicate a Gpu per eye for future games and titles the possibilities are simply endless, I can't believe some of these games. I've also played a vast majority of the oculus titles on the vive some of those are amazing as well. I've used both headsets and vive wins hands down, my only concern that oculus may get the AAA titles over vive but vive has a strong background in gaming with its connection with steam which is huge. I just haven't seen that knockout title on vive like oculus such as chronos, which is sick and Lucky tale which is actually enjoyable! By the way playable on vive it's just a hassle to setup and get going. If u haven't gotten yours or simply can't get one, it's worth paying a little extra to start now seriously lol it's that good. Kids these days seriously are spoiled they have no idea how lucky they are

Edit: ""Steam"" now says that the HTC Vive now ships within 2-3 days when ordering from the official site. So now there's absolutely NO reason to get it so overpriced here!Original review:Before I even start my review, just want to clarify - DO NOT buy it here, unless you absolutely need this headset the next day and you've got nowhere else to spend that extra $500. Go ahead and order it at the official site for $800 and wait a bit, the initial rush is pretty much almost over. I only had to wait a week before mine shipped, and just 2 more days for the actual shipment.This headset is pure awesomeness. I had it for almost a week now, and I just love it! Vive truly gives you beyond a solid experience, especially with its Room-Scale VR, Oculus doesn't even come close here. I've been spending hours playing in VR every day, and it really gives you a feeling that you're really there, to a point where you even forget that you're in VR! Talking from experience here, hit my ceiling in a jump, twice :DA word of warning though. This thing is a pain to set up. Be prepared to use a drill to mount the base stations, unless you decide to buy separate tripods for them. Not to mention all the cable clutter you will have to manage somehow. Still, that all was not a surprise for me, I knew what I was signing up for. Just make sure you do too.

I have had the HTC Vive for 6 months now and I absolutely love it. You will need some room to really enjoy the Vive, but it can work well in areas as small as 5x5 but works best in 10x10 areas as some games require.

$110 for HTC to repair your controller when it breaks and it will break believe me. Ive been a repair man since 1998 these controllers are designed to break. HTC kinda went to the dark side on their controller warranty policy. Designed to purposely break. Shame on you HTC I was a big fan but now ill be happy to return my vive. The games suck so im not losing anything

Honestly, I can't recommend it. I was really excited for this and well... I am sorely disappointed.Pros:---Immersive, really does trick you into feeling like you are in a different place sometimes.---Multiplayer games can be funCons:Where do I begin... (keep in mind this is $800)---The game selection is very weak. There are about 3 games worth getting (all short, early access games) All the other games are basically demo indy-games. And there are A LOT of those. Sort of feels like a cell phone game marketplace. Desperately needs new AAA titles and anyone with a Vive will tell you that.---The displays in the headset are so close to your face they just do not end up very clear or crisp. This was the biggest bummer to me. Nothing looks clean, you can very easily see pixels, and everything in the distance in EVERY game is a complete blurry mess. I think that is important to know because no one warned me about this and it can be a big disappointment. There are ways to fix some of this (supersampling) but you'll need a very powerful pc set up.---You need a pretty beefy computer to even run it, and most of the games are not very well optimized which means no matter what you have they just don't run all that great. I have specs that are about average and above the required specs, tested high in the SteamVR benchmark (8.8), yet still really struggle with most games.---The construction is decent, but regardless my controller broke after 3 weeks of use even with no physical damage at all (HTC support is also terrible).---Initial setup isn't too bad, but putting all gear on every time you want to play gets too be pretty annoying.---The headset itself is really uncomfortable, mostly because it is very heavy. Also expect to sweat with it on.---Some of the games cause serious motion sickness type feelings where even when you take the headset off you feel dizzy afterwards (sometimes for up to an hour or so)Like I said, very disappointing. I had high hopes and it ends up just feeling like a toy (and a headache). I don't think this is even ready for mass market to be honest. Feels like a prototype. Save your $800 and just buy some better computer components or a nice big television or a ton of games and save some money. If I could go back I probably would not buy it again, and very well may end up selling mine.

Not at all worth the price tag. Being $300 more than the original headset, this horrible ripoff does NOT come with controllers or base stations for tracking. There is not a single reason this should be a standalone product, let alone at the price point it is at. Unless you already have the original vive headset, ordering this is pointless. And if you do have one, it's still not worth it for the extra couple pixels this provides. This product has basically no functionality when bought alone, and right now in order to buy controllers and tracking stations on amazon it costs $700 combined, as the only options are third party amazon pages selling controllers for around $350, showing incorrect specs and no pictures. DO NOT BUY.

While the price can be deterring, and it probably would be smarter to buy from HTC's website when available, the HTC Vive is worth the money, without a doubt. First, the immersion is insane. You forget that you're not actually there, shooting those drones or blocking those orbs. Second, the six degrees of freedom allows for really creative and very active games, and the accuracy of the tracking is highly impressive. The resolution is lacking right now as the tech is improving, but in many cases, it's completely irrelevant. The more immersive and active games make you forget completely about the pixel density. It's only really while trying to use the Vive to view movies or your desktop that it's an issue. There as an exponentially increasing number of games for it, and many larger game devs and games are adding Vive support for their games (War Thunder and Tabletop Simulator are two that come to mind). The price of the unit is worth it, but make sure your computer can actually run it, which is where the issues arise and the actual price tag starts to jump. Also, the controllers are tanks. I went for a very hard hit in Holoball and the strap broke (upgrade your straps to some Wii straps FYI), the controller flew and dented the sword I have on my wall, and still works completely fine

I love my HTC Vive.It truly is a brand new experience from anything I've ever seen before.Boom. I am a truck driver. Looking out onto the street, with steering wheel right in front of me. I look around to see the inside of the truck, behind me to see the cars waiting behind me. It all feels real.Boom. I am on a tennis court. Racket in one hand, ball in the other. I practice my serving, and quickly get the hang of it. I feel like I might actually have some real tennis talent hahaBoom. I am a secret agent, trapped in a building with robots who want to kill me. I can kill them with throwing-knives. I must sneak through the building to find the exit. A robot is coming, so I hide under a desk.Boom. I am another secret agent, with a jetpack, soaring through the city.There's no limit to what you will see. And really, it's a beyond-amazing experience.That being said, be careful as to whether you buy it or not. It's not perfect. It requires a lot of setup. There are a LOT of wires to deal with. For the best experience you'll need a fairly large empty space. Setting everything up is not fun, but the game experience is worth it. It can be a bit tricky at times.Best bet, would be to wait for the next versions, or for prices to come down.But if you're ready and willing to go all-in to the world of Virtual Reality, the HTC Vive is AMAZING.DO NOT buy from re-sellers on Amazon. Go to the HTCVive website to order there.As much as I love the Vive, you should not pay twice-the-price for it.That, along with my other caveats, is why I'm rating a 3 here.

The Vive, though still in its infancy, does not work on 90% of computers out there. The compositor software takes weeks to get working properly. The SteamVR app typically fails to initialize, and there are numerous other errors that just seem highly unlikely as the culprit. I have a 700$ graphics card in my machine and it says my card ""may not be able to run this software corrctly"" .Not sure how much more they need from us to make this system work, but, frankly, I have tried for 3 weeks to make this thing work, and I have had no luck. This is accross numerous different machines each of them extremely high end machines, I am returning my HTC Vive and getting a different VR headset. It is apparent that thier custoemer service is AWEFUL. They really have no documentation to help you troubleshoot the issue. You have to sift the internet to try and find a problem that resembles your problem, but isn't exactly YOUR problem, then you have to try and  piecemeal together any kind of solution on your own. I'm not going to sift through 800 pages of forum messages on the HTC website, either make this thing work, or pull the plug on it.

After having my HTC Vive for a couple of weeks now, I felt it prudent to write a review for all of you potential buyers. To give a bit of a background about myself, I am an extreme game enthusiast and dedicate a copious amount of time playing video games on a daily basis - I did not strap this thing on for thirty minutes and then put it up onto the shelf to collect dust.Anywho, enough about me and more about the Vive.Pros:-It's an experience that is truly unique to any other gaming system out there. You simply CANNOT duplicate it.-Set up and installation takes about an hour and comes with clear instructions.-Due to the immersive nature of the system, every game has a distinct feel to it.Cons:-Price (obviously).-Lack of content with replay value.-Resolution.-Mask area is prone to get sweaty, if you're playing physically engaging game, (i.e. Audioshield)-Several glitches using the menu interface going in between games.-Space required to achieve the optimal experience.Overall, I would say that the HTC Vive is a great launch platform for VR. Do I think it is worth the $800 price tag? At the moment, absolutely not. While playing any of the games I tried out in VR was an incredible experience, none of them had any replay value whatsoever; this is by the far the heavy hitting negative toward the Vive. The problem is amplified given the fact that there's a hundred or so ""games"", (more like experiences, or tech demos), out for the thing that you're apt to keep shoveling $5-$10 to see if the next ""game"" is worth it. The Steam reviews attest for this fact as well; many of the users are giving the large amount of titles great reviews, yet most of the users only play these games 1/2 - 2 hours. I do have to say, that Elite Dangerous was the only game that kept me coming back, (I'm around 40 some odd hours), and I would definitely get a Vive if they were a handful of games like it. Additionally, while my initial reaction to the whole experience was breathtaking, I was a bit disappointed with the graphics, (then again, I am using a GTX 970, but everything else meets or surpasses recommendations, so take that for what you will). As of right now, I am still using my Vive, but less and less each day. There's simply too little great, quality content with high replay value.TLDR; While the Vive is a fascinating system that gives an experience bar none, it's not worth shelling out $800+ due to the lack of content with high replay value and somewhat mediocre graphics, (unless you have the money to burn, that is).EDIT: After using the Vive with my new GTX 1080, I'd say that graphics & framerate has improved considerably, but it hasn't done anything about the resolution bit; this does not change my original review at all.

The reality is that this headset is riding the hype of VR. You don the headset and are instantly amazed, but it is only later that you begin to see the flaws. It was a headset created quickly in response to the longstanding work of Oculus, and it shows. It looks terrible, the controllers are ergonomically flawed. Fiddling with the wire is incredibly annoying. It doesn't fit snugly on your head. If you look straight down, the headset shifts. Trying to use headphones is incredibly annoying. Its a big mess of wires. These are all aspects fixed on the Oculus. We should stop rewarding a company for releasing a lower quality headset just because they shoved it out sooner. They just built hardware. Oculus built an experience. I've used both extensively. I assure you you'll get annoyed with this headset.Separate concern: Room scale is a disconcerting fix for the locomotion problem. You find yourself walking, which is great, but only to the extent of 10 feet or so, at which point you have to switch back to teleportation. This switch only makes the locomotion disconnect you feel stronger and more pronounced.

So  I am thinking maybe Amazon sent me a used one!Anyway here are some pros and cons:Pros: - cool looking - really nice conceptCons: - Picture is blurry! I basically became dizzy after using it for 5 minutes or so. (in the question answer seller is claiming you can watch movies, surf the web, etc etc..., I say it is a big lie! it is very hard, if not impossible, to read a text using vive and I have almost perfect vision) - relatively heavy! - It has wire! yes I was under impression it can work wireless! what is point of safety when the wire is all over you.Even though I love the concept and was supper exited, unfortunately I should say it is not production ready.

When it works, it's great. When after 2 weeks your 3 in 1 cable stops displaying video you will be SOL. Contact customer service and they will give you the run around for weeks.The first two weeks were amazing but all there is now is regret and anger for buying this product. All I have now are giant paperweights.update:After 3 months the replacement cable finally came. Works pretty good now, but am still worried about the durability of the new cables.

I haven't been able to even play with it because HTC support is atrocious.I received the package with the wrong power adapter (EU instead of US).Apparently they can only help me via the live chat, which is a total POS.Can't really tell what's going on (""team unavailable"", weird red icons, etc) and if you accidentally click something, you lose it and have to restart.Sometimes the little applet thingy wont even let you type into it.I cannot believe a company like HTC doesn't have a decent support service.It's enough to make me want to dodge future products by them.EDIT:It's been 3 weeks now, HTC is now asking me for the same information for the 4th time.Seriously never buying another HTC product ever again.You can roll the dice and hope that they don't screw up your order, but I wouldn't recommend it.

We ordered from HTC.  We tried to get this to  work around 5 times where we spent around 2-3 hours each.  The base stations fade in and out, the headset looses tracking ect.  We got it to work for a few minuets and it was pretty cool.  We set it up in two different rooms all to no avail.  There is no product support on this thing from HTC.  After trying to contact them on three occasions I finally was able to communicate over a chat with someone who didn't really know anything about the setup of the product.  They offered to open a case file and someone would contact me sometime in the next two days; very ineffective communication.  I opted to use the time with the chat person to set up a return authorization.  I would be careful buying one of these.  I think the first batch must have gone out to software developers and reviewers and they had tech support.  It will be interesting to see if the early production models will work.  There is no tech support on this thing, it is super glitchy, it has constant firmware updates (which means they don't have it working reliably yet), on a windows based machine with all the driver conflicts and now the steam and HTC drivers and software, good luck.  Mine didn't work, I would not buy from a second party without a warentee or the ability to return it when you find out how glitchy this thing is.

On paper the the Vive looks great but after any more than 15 minutes with their absurdly heavy headset on and you'll wish you'd bought something else. It's so heavy that you can't look down without having the headset pull away from your face and distort the picture to the point that it makes you sick. Even worse, the controllers are absolute junk. Rather than buttons they use touch pads that only occasionally register the right button press. If you're like me then you'll end up with one controller that doesn't even register your thumb. Then there are the base stations that make a high pitched whining sound and never turn off unless you enable bluetooth. Once you enable bluetooth then they never turn on. You have to have them 6 feet up in the air though so of course, disconnecting and reconnecting the cable constantly to force them to turn on is a huge headache.Try to get support and you'll find that they have no phone support and the chat support (that they've hidden) is never available. They list hours of 9am to 10pm but no matter what time you try to contact them it says chat is unavailable. When I did finally reach someone by chatting with HTC's mobile division and having them chat with the Vive support reps but troubleshooting anything like that is impossible.After about 20 hours I finally got them to accept a repair. They insisted that I pay shipping to get the controller repaired though. I told them I just want to return it then. They insist I pay return shipping. If you do buy it at least buy it from a retail store like Amazon so you have some protection if it turns out to be terrible, which many will find it to be.

My brother -in-law spent three thousand dollars(if you include the ridiculously expensive computer it needs)  on this system.  He is really excited about it and thinks it is really cool.  I had a totally different experience while using it.  It felt like playing blind mans bluff with a snake twisting around your leg while trying to avoid tripping yourself( You can't see your REAL surrounding but there is a cable ALWAYS twisting around your feet.).  Both my brother-in-law and one of his friends nearly fell over when a zombie jumped out at them in one game, which almost led to a three thousand dollar setup being smashed.  Really, good luck when one of your guests gets hurt and sues you for everything you own.  If you think wii controllers going through tvs are bad; picture someone breaking an ankle, an arm, or their neck-and its gonna happen.  Did I mention it also gives people motion sickness, so they are walking around dizzy as well as blind. Possibly the stupidest thing I've ever seen three thousand dollars wasted on.****Update****10/26/16My great nephews aunt tried it(shes around 30 years old), got vertigo,literally dove out of the safe-boundary grid and smashed a 9 inch dent in the wall with her head(luckily she wasn't seriously injured),  I know some of you spent a lot of money on this(including my brother-in-law) and maybe its wrong for me to call purchasers of the system stupid(because I've bought some stupid things); but I still think it's inherently very dangerous.  I'll try and submit a photo of the hole she made with her head the next time I get to my sisters house.****Update**** 10/26/16 Added photo of dent in the wall and scratch where the controller hit from facebook, sorry it's a cell phone image and not clearer.*****Update***** 1/21/19  My brother in law still uses his headset, though I think it interests the rest of the family a lot less.  Even he admits some of the games make him nauseous and cause him to break out in a sweat.  We have a continuing debate over whether it was worth the money.  He points out that I spent 1,700 dollars on my movie room I didn't really need.  The only fault I find with that logic is my movie room has 780 hours use on it by the bulb counter in my projector after  eight months.  Everyone, my friends , family, comes to watch movies, eat and hang out.  His vr gear, being isolationist in nature  and by his own admission of use,  gets far less use.  Its also three years in, and he has never approached me with a title that absolutely blows everyone s doors off.  I'm starting to doubt they are every gonna sell enough of them to attract serious developers, or have a game you can play without fatigue or nausea for extended amounts of time.  The cheaper headsets are coming out and that might save them. I don't know, the whole thing reminds me of 3d tv.  My brother-in-law thought that was the second coming too, because he is fascinated by gimmicks.  I thought that would flop too.  Time will tell on this one.****************update Thansgiving 2019***********************My brother in law showed us his steam account that he spent around a thousand dollars on for mostly  vive games.  The hilarious thing about it is that 99 percent of them had less than 10 minutes of play time on them.  So even though he wont admit the thing is stupid(he spent a fortune on it), he bought a thousand dollars worth of games he(or anyone ), never play.  Why? Because it's STUPID.

I feel bad for HTC. If that is their last hope to revive (pun intended) their dying brand - it is likely going to be a painful end.  I went to a Microsoft store to give a try to this latest so called ""high end"" VR headset, dubbed to be the top of the line (alongside Rift with same visual specs) that in currently available, offered in $800. Took the full demo with the underwater experience, the space shooter, etc.  Wow. Talk about not ready for prime time... First thing you notice is how bad the resolution is. You can literally count the pixels. You would expect the technology advanced since the 80's to allow far better resolution, but the experience is really lousy. There were arcade games 15 years ago with better resolution. On top of that - the optics are hazy. Of course it is... Every person has different eye characteristics, distance between the eyes, etc. It takes few moments to adjust (though uncomfortably feels like constantly eye-crossing a bit). And then there is the clumsy handling of the headset - it is heavy and doesn't matter how tight you fix the straps - you can't stop thinking about it squeezing your chicks.  And there is the bundle of wires you can't stop tripping on (if you try to move around) not to mention you have to setup your room with the additional sensors to support that motion. The limited field of view is disappointing too (though expected). I was skeptic before, but still had much higher expectations. This is clearly far from being any notable step forward from the 80's tech. I can't believe anyone would pay $800 for that (or pay at all).  To be honest - even the $100 Gear toy headset felt similar.  As nice and understanding as I could try to be to this attempt (one of many) to refurbish this old tech into the new era - it is literally a piece of junk. Not even worthy as a toy.  Wouldn't spend a cent on it (nor Rift or all other gimmicks).  It seems like it will take another decade (at least) till something practical will be available (if the hype survives till then).

Seems like a great upgrade from the OG Vive I had. I highly recommend that you do the Samsung Gear 2016 lens mod, swapped my lens and adapters over and the clarity on this HMD is amazing. Very little of no screen door effect. I have a wireless adapter otherwise I would of gotten the Valve Index for a 120-144hz refresh rate, but 90hz is great too. Will do an update on this but man this headset seems lighter and much more comfortable. I just wanted better resolution and can definitely tell, especially with the lens mod!!!!

I highly recommend this system to anyone looking to buy one.

It is an incredibly comfortable headset. No dizziness for me and most that have tried mine.With a suitable graphics card and a PC that is at least a quad core i7, this will provide an amazing experience. In some ways its therapeutic.You need also two base stations and at least one paddle. Vive do their own base stations (AKA light houses) but for larger spaces there is an alternatives.  A good Internet connection is highly recommended - there s a lot to download when changing VR experiences.Now is a good time to buy as NVidia graphics card prices are on the slide due to the decline in the bitcoin market. You need at least an NVidia 1080 (or equivalent from another supported vendor) but for realistic Ray Tracing capability, one of the NVidia 2080 series is best. The graphics card must have a display port.I've stopped using it with XPlane 11 flight sim only because it is too addictive but with a powerful graphics card and full AI, the experience becomes extraordinarily realistic.Until a few months ago this was a top of the range. There's a new headset on the horizon with 4K per eye and 220 degree viewing angle but not from Vive and is USB-C (the future standard agreed for VR headsets). This model doesn't have USB-C but delivered with the required hardware. Setting up of the VR the first time can be a bit tricky.VR is not quite real life but the available media out there for games and eduction is phenomenal - highly recommend Google Earth VR, Apollo 11 Mission, The Lab, etc. Kids would enjoy walking amongst dinosaurs and its something the whole family would enjoy.While a fan of Apple Computers, getting them working with graphics processors (eGPU's) s has been tricky. Microsoft Windows (10 ideally) is currently the most supported platform for games and VR software.I hope you get one and enjoy it as much as I enjoy mine!

The good:VR games are fun! Beatport has been a blast, Subnautica has a been a bunch of fun as a VR port, my wife is loving moss.The Bad:All told it took ~5 hours of game play for one of the base stations (the little cubes that read your position in the room) to stop working. It just sits there with a blinking red light. Support tells me this is a hardware problem, and that to get it fixed I'll need to ship it back to them at my expense, wait about a month, then they'll hopefully ship a working unit back to me. I guess we're not doing any room-scale VR this month.At this price point I expected HTC to offer an advance shipment swap. One of those deals where they ship you a new working unit and you return the non-functional one in the same box promptly or they charge your credit card. But that's not something they will offer.Conclusion:I wont buy from HTC again.

I made the mistake of not immediately returning the system when i was having repeated tracking issues way back when i ordered it, and now im basically out the 2000 dollars this system costs because the support team doesn't listen and just has me reset my drivers over and over and over.

A diferencia de el HTC Vive regular, la resolucion de este headset es increible, dile adios a las letras borrosas cuando intentas leer menus o texto dentro de tus juegos VR.Lo bueno:-El strap con audio es excelente, infinitamente superior al vive regular. El audio es bastante bueno, pero nada impresionante pero la conveniencia de no tener que conectar audifonos externos es bienvenida-Las bocinas pueden ser removidas y ajustadas segun tus necesidades-No mas texto borroso en los juegos-Solamente requiere un cable, ya no son 3 como en el vive regularLo malo-Necesitas minimo una 1080Ti para no estar en constante reprojection (si no te molesta esto, o si no sabes lo que es, entonces ni te preocupes)en juegos pesados como Skyrim VR,Fallout 4 VR o Doom VFR.-Removieron el jack de 3mm para audifonos, ahora se requiere de un adaptador externo USB C  (esto duele si quieres usar audifonos premium)-Por el precio, no incluye ni las bases, ni los controles, esto significa que si no tienes un vive regular con los sensores y controles, tienes que adquirirlos por separado y el precio se dispara.-Hasta el momento, no hay juegos ni apps que utilizen las dos camaras frontales, solo una esta activada en estos momentos.Resumen: La parte ""PRO"" del nombre de este producto no parece ser una broma o una tecnica de mercadotecnia, este producto definitivamente no esta hecho para el consumidor regular. Es un excelente equipo pero si no vas a participar en el desarrollo de aplicaciones o juegos en VR yo sugeriria abstenerse y disfrutar el vive regular por un año mas, en lo que se desarrollan las nuevas versiones para consumidores.

I have ordered the VR headset from Amazon Warehouse Deals and the headset is just dead not working at all. There is a big sticker on the box stating that this is a TESTED DEVICE FROM AMAZON and guest what it's not working. There was also a big sticker on the Headset from the previous owner ( West River School something like that) so that mean that the headset was probaly used by many many people before sent back to Amazon.

First Off, my Vive arrived on a Thursday and broke that Sunday. I am getting it replaced, free of charge by Amazon. HTC tried to help me get it back up and running but to no avail. They have great customer service. I am not happy that this happened, but I also understand that with mass production, sometimes things happen or don't work as they should all the time.Now, on to the review!This thing is AMAZING! I have never gotten such a workout in my life. I am a computer guy. I like to play games and research stuff on the internet. This has unfortunately led to an unhealthy lifestyle and I needed to shed a few pounds. I wanted to get a VR system anyway so I thought may be this would be a great way to kill two birds with one stone.And it is.This thing tricks you. You think you're just having fun playing games, but no. It is a full body workout and I love it! I have never been able to find something that was fun and exercise at the same time, but now I have it. I have an approximately 3m x 1.5m room-scale setup. While this works without a hitch most of the time, I would definitely recommend a 3m x 2m space if at all possible. I play Audioshield, Holopoint, The Golf Club VR, Superhot VR, Sword Master VR and Raw Data for exercise and activity. Of these, Holopoint and Audioshield are definitely the most intensive... but they are also a blast to play. I would definitely recommend this headset to anyone who has a powerful enough PC and can afford it, and would also like to get a nice workout in their own home.Now, a few other things;-The screen door effect is pretty bad unfortunately. However, as my HMD did die after 3 days, this may have just been a faulty or defective item. I will have to wait and see.-I wear glasses. I did not have problem with making the headset feel comfortable at all. Very spacious if you wear glasses.-My hand tracking seemed to be a bit wacky sometimes. However, I am gonna go out on a limb and blame myself for this one and say it was my fault for bad sensor placement.- I have an i7 5930k and a GTX 1080 TI. I never had any problems with framerates or whatnot.

Not Plug n Play for MacOS Mojave. Which had been announced by Apple 2018. HTC also walked away from their opportunity with Apple firmly stated NO MAC/APPLE Support from HTC Online/Call Centre. This was not communicated to Apple Support or Retail employees which was a vicious circle of HW & SW and two manufacturers pointing fingers to one another and driving hopefully  VR Mac users away.For Apple I am going to say I have had it and will be buying a PC and Mid-Advanced level HUD and equipment...Occulu? Perhaps Apple will release their own and put these barely 1.5/2gen VR solutions to shame.One thing I think Apple & HTC also smeared the YouTube/Googles algorithms because barely any other HTC VR / Apple / Steam users comments exist post Fall 2018 search results...Definitely not a good hobby for early adopters...

My HTC Vive arrived in perfect working condition and I have had no problems 2 weeks under heavy use. The system itself is an amazing piece of technology and the illusion created by accurate tracking and room scale is one that I have not seen matched by either the PSVR or the Occulos (although the Occulos is close when using 3+ sensors). After extended periods of use however, I've noticed that the screen door effect is becoming more prevalent, this mostly happens when I unfocus my eyes while thinking. If you play games that are still interesting to you, you'll be really immersed in the experience.Everybody I let try my headset have been amazed. Videos are not able to do it justice.I was playing a game called smash party recently and accidentally smashed one of the controllers full force into my wall, I dented the wall but the controller still works fine!

The device comes with everything you will need. No need to go out and buy extra cables. Everything is easy to set up, and when you plug it in, Steam recognizes it right away for even easier install. The mask is fairly comfortable, and the controls are very lightweight. The controls are easy to learn, you just need to remember that you don't HAVE to walk physically everywhere, the device let's you move. 10/10 would recommend to everyone.

I'm passionate about VR and have been since i first played Dactyl Nightmare in the 90s.  I enjoyed the Vive a ton and the upgrade to the Vive pro is a huge step in terms of visuals.  Everything is clearer, the screen door effect is nearly gone and the headset is much more comfortable.  The built in headphones are great and seem better than those on the premium strap upgrade but are still basic.In the box for my unit was an annual Viveport Subscription which gives you access to 5 games a month for 12 months (worth $144 CAD) & a Viveport credit of $125 CAD to purchase games.If you already have a Vive and enjoy it a lot, this is a great upgrade.  If you don't, the price tag just doesn't make sense.

I bought the bundle HTC Vive Pro and found it easy to install and great to watch/play.  The graphics quality is very good and, with Steam, the number of games/programs available is ever increasing.  I'm very happy with my purchase.  However, I find that it's very expensive to upgrade it to become wireless.

A fantastic headset that's actually pretty easy to set up. After you place your lighthouses (two small black boxes) on some shelves in opposite corners (or mount them to the walls with the included kit), you just download some software and follow very straightforward instructions.Because the lighthouses need to be in opposite corners of each other, I would advise buying an regular power extension cable if your wall outlets are not optimally placed.Unfortunately my headset arrived with a defect (a large vertical green line on the right eye of the headset). I'm not deducting any stars because they customer service was very helpful, and a replacement for the headset is already on the way. Looking forward to it!

Amazing VR set, though you NEED ALOT of room to play it comfortably. DO NOT TRY to squeeze it into a small office, you will just ruin the experience. I do recommend picking up the games on steam when they go on sale. I got this with the Deluxe Audio Strap and I really enjoy it. I use this VR as a way to get cardio fitness in without having to hit the gym or run around the block. The games are becoming better and better each month and you do need to have a beefy computer to use this. I ran this on a i7 and GTX1060 OC without too much stuttering. One thing VR does need is that the games needs to be on a SSD to prevent weird stuttering.

I was not pleased when I learned one of the base station were defective. Only 27 days into having the Vive the base station was showing a flashing red light. It was an easy fix through amazon, but I didn't think I would've needed to return it within the first month for the defective base station.Other than the defective unit, the experience is amazing! For the first experience I felt sick to the stomach, and I loved it. Depending on the game it gives a genuine feeling like you are  the character. If a game can make my stomach turn, it's doing a good job giving an experience you can't forget. The first couple of days using the Vive gave was uncomfortable, but after a week or two everything was smooth and perfect for my liking. It took a while to find the perfect fit and setup through the nobs for customization for eye sizes and distance.Overall, worth the buy, but really disappointing on the defective unit I got. I hope I don't need to send more components.

Image quality so much better than original Vive. Headset is much more comfortable and cable more compact and less distracting. Screen door effect much less noticeable though not entirely eliminated. God rays effect is lessened too though still present especially for games with deep blacks such as Elite Dangerous. There remains an issue with the sweet spot of focus for me, still too narrow (compared to say the Quest) causing blur at the edges. Perhaps related to FOV, though I have an above average head size and pupil distance which might be the cause of this in my case.Still, overall a terrific improvement, which with a slightly lower price and the addition of wireless would easily be the best VR I've experienced yet.Loss of one star though for the price which even as an upgrade is a little on the high side, and far worse for the whole package.

So I have had this for a few days now, and would consider myself a VR enthusiast. This is purely for personal use, no business or professional stuff at all. And I paid full price... so part of me wants to feel good about the money I spent, but I'm well aware it is still overpriced.Main take away; the increased pixel density is noticeable. Text is much easier to read, and everything is much more clear. As you have surely read, the screen door effect is not gone. But, it's far less intrusive. I found particularly in driving games on the regular Vive it was distracting. But now, it's minimal. This is a big plus, and 90% of the reason I wanted it.Audio. The speakers are much worse. Really disappointed there. I have been hooked on Beat Saber, but now the music sounds super flat and dull. Takes the groove out of the game.Update: use a powered USB hub, seems to help a lot.Comfort. At first, I was afraid it was worse, but then watched the video and now it's about equal I'd say. Perhaps better balanced. Put the mask on first, then lower the strap behind you after, and then adjust the top strap last. Then move the ear pieces. It's pretty  good, but not a huge improvement.Other things I've noticed, every now and then the audio is very crackly. Have to reboot it to fix. And I'm noticing my base stations are wonkier than before. Maybe a firmware update is to come.So, if you love VR, this is a good buy. It makes everything better. If you have kinda slowed down using VR, this probably won't reignite the flame, unless you mostly like driving games, or maybe text heavy games like Elite Dangerous.

I was very skeptical about Vive Pro and the overall improvement in resolution and SDE based on so many people complaining that the difference is not much noticeable. I took the dive anyways and bought the Vive Pro, and I'm happy to say It's a major improvement. I see a clear difference with higher resolution and image clarity. SDE is much reduced. While perceived image quality is subjective but I would say anyone who claims that there's no noticeable difference need to have their vision checked.The SDE effect is still there though and noticeable but not as horrible as OG Vive. Also, major improvement in comfort as well compared to OG Vive with DAS. I have Vive Wireless Adapter on top and still the headset is extremely comfortable for hours of gameplay.One star off for audio quality which is a complete disappointment compared to DAS. I don't have tinny sound issues as many were reporting, but the volume and bass levels are extremely lacking for my taste. After hours of researching and troubleshooting I ended up 3D printing Vive Pro bass clips that press headphones more firmly on my ears (you can get the 3D file from Vive Community discussion forum).Lenses, FOV and god rays are exact same as OG Vive. I bought a 6mm face foam that allows for a little improvement in FOV. The cable compartment door on headset is way too flimsy and easy to break. It's a bad design. Be careful when opening and be gentle.Mic quality is on par with OG Vive but overall it's not good. I don't use mic anyways. Camera quality is a bit worse though. Currently there's a bug with SteamVR that it doesn't allow to change camera rate so it's locked are 45. If I can change it to 60 and notice improvement I'll update the review. The dual camera stereo room view with pass through is extremely cool, but again everyone is experiencing a bug now that the stereo separation is incorrect and you feel like cross-eyed.Amazon initially shipped an open box (seal broken) but they were quick to send a new sealed box the next day so again best service from Amazon to quickly correct the mistake.There are currently other headset on the rise such as Pimax 5K+ and 8K, but it all depends on your choices and priorities. My #1 priority is wireless. Wired VR gaming was never an option for me and a total immersion breaker. My first dive in VR was with OG Vive, TPCast and Fallout 4 VR, so that's where I'm coming from. I've never played wired. Pimax headsets consumer launches are months away, and no updates on wireless module plans. I can easily give up a wider FOV for wireless option and better support any day.The bottom line - Vive Pro is the ultimate current headset available for consumers. It has it's pros and cons but it depends on your priorities, system specs, choices and budget. Is it worth 999? Absolutely not; it's way overpriced. Is it the best headset? Yes absolutely, depending what your prioritize.Until Pimax 5K+ ships with a wireless module or the Vive 2.0 becomes available, this is the best of the best you can get. Hoe this helped.

Amazing product, but not for those that aren't computer proficient. Right off the bat, I was having some issues setting up my HTC Vive. However, customer support was incredibly nice and helpful, and had me up and rolling in a few hours. I also have a PSVR and have used the Oculus Rift, and must say that this is by far the best and most amazing VR experience out there. I would highly recommend this to anybody, but do have some warnings! Firstly, be prepared for lots of glitches and problems while using this. While there are a couple hardware issues, most of the glitches are software glitches. These are all solvable, but might require some time and troubleshooting. Anybody good with computers should have no problems, but for example my parents would be utterly lost. Secondly, make sure your PC specs are well above the minimum required specs to run the HTC Vive. My computer is a bit more powerful than the minimum requirements, and has at times had serious problems trying to run some software on the Vive.Overall this product is amazing and I highly recommend it for those wanting the best possible VR experience. For those looking to get into VR without the hassle or the expensive PC build, I would highly recommend the PSVR.

It wasn’t made clear that the headset doesn’t come with everything you need.  Does not come with the base stations, had to purchase after seeing on the box that they are required.  Also the headset was very finicky to set up, constantly failing to connect and randomly asking for firmware updates after already having done previous firmware updates.  Seems like the software could use some improvement.  Shortly after setting up the headset a brand new video card failed, not sure if that’s related or not, but if it happens again after replacement I’ll update my review.

Controllers break every 3 months or so, sweat is super effective on this VR HMD so I'd recommend buying HyperKin protectors if you really want the controllers to last longer. The batteries for them can last long, about 6-8 hours which is good. The HMD is lacking a bit of Fov since you can still see the black bars in the lower parts when you try putting it perfectly on your head, the resolution is decent I'd say but text from afar is hard to read especially on VrChat usernames, the more far away an object is, the harder it is to read, from up-close though the details are the best, as every consoles. Finally, the thing to adjust your eyes is a really good feature for many people to use and the shipping was good too but the Customer Support is the worst part. A decently enjoyable purchase, even more so with the Wireless Adapter but it only lasts about 2 hours while the controllers last 6 to 8 hours and the fullbody trackers about 5-6 hours if you buy that with it for fullbody purposes. With the upcoming launch of the Valve Index and the new-gen of Virtual HeadSets, I'd probably recommend the Pimax 5kPlus or the 8k if you have the money for it, the Vive isn't that impressive to have in 2019, you'd better opt for the new stuff. Oh yeah, the tracking is good too.

This was my first VR headset and my god.. when you first play a game in VR it's NOTHING like the videos you've seen online, it's insane! I'll never forget my first experience with VR. I used the original Vive for years and one complaint I've always had was the controllers.. they're just not comfortable!Don't get me wrong, they work fine. But instead of having a joystick, you have a sort of thumb-touchpad that can be a bit weird in some games. Also the touchpad has buttons underneath it, so you can press the touchpad with your thumb in up, down, left or right for example. Pressing on the right was the first button press to die and it died on BOTH vive controllers and is apparently a faulty issue. So any games that require you to press the touchpad right button become impossible unless you can change controls.Other than that, it's a great headset and the controllers get the job done. Like I said I'd used the vive for years before I finally bought myself an Index and the difference is night and day, but obviously you're paying more.

when setting up properly, the tracking is almost perfect all the time; however, when playing games that are fast-paced like beat saber, myself and friends constantly press the steam overlay buttons by accident. The headphones are good, but the biggest downside is the display inside the headset. this may be an old headset, but the price for this isn't great when you can't read text on the low-resolution display in each eye. and when used for awhile, it hurts the top of your head, and it doesn't strap tight enough for someone who has a small head like me

I’ve been obsessed with my Vive! It’s a little struggle when first setting it up but it’s works amazing and tracking is awesome! I’m giving it four stars because I do have a problem with the headset (one the wireless receivers won’t connect with both of the remotes wirelessly so I have to play with one connected to the PC. Apparently it’s a common issue which is the main reason for 4 stars. However I didn’t contact support after finding the issue even though I had a 30 return so I don’t blame Vive for my personal issue as I didn’t take initial action to fix it so that’s on me.)It’s been amazing to play and once you get it set up and figured out its a breeze to set it up again. If you get the VR I recommend you get BeatSaber! It’s an absolute must and the main game I play! It’s the best workout I’ve ever had, you can have literal beads of sweat drip down your face and body and not even notice because it’s so fun!The Vive is also a lot more resilient (it’s essentially the Nokia of VR headsets, if you drop the controller it will be fine, versus if you drop an Oculus which will probably fly apart). Lastly the controller and headset is a bit heavier compared to Oculus but personally I don’t mind I only wish there was an alternative to the foam padding around the eyes because once I start really sweating it does get itchy and uncomfortable.

It's hard to show someone on a screen a massive 3000sqft+ home but I am hoping with the VIVE that one day I will be able to get my client to come in put on the headset and see my design in VR to give them a feel of the size, depth and beauty of the custom built home before we even start building.

Nice system, but I think my expectations for VR are too high.  I expected an awesome immersive experience but got a very good experience.  Some downsides are the lack of VR titles and visual issues.  The visuals aren't crisp enough for my liking.  I upgraded my video card to a GTX1080 and have all of the other minimum system requirements.

While waiting for the game to finish downloading, i went out for lunch.

It does not come with tripods or clips, for those of you who may need them (but you knew that already, I’m sure.)Setup was pretty straightforward. I know that it’s obvious, but do make sure that your PC is good enough for this product and that you have enough space on the walls (or for tripods) for your sensors before you impulse buy.

ProsCome swith everything you need to setup a basic room for tracking, using your two controllers.Easy to set up, very straightforward, easy to start on first try.ConsThe strap is not sufficient for all sizes, it is inadequate and i will be searching for an upgrade strap to better secure the headset in a posiiton that is comfortable, and stable, considering the price, it's not something i wnat to slip off, but the native default strap it comes with very easily allows for this to happen.The censors installed in the top corner of my room are not easy to remove, i much would have preferred to have tripod stands unfortunately i am going to have to plug up holes in my wall i used to secure them.Anybody even thinking about getting this, i implore you to get it. We wnat more people to get in this with us. More games will get made due to demand, and we all of course, love hanging out on VRCHAT together ;)See you on at the VR Clubs!

Virtual reality is for real this time.  I built a new PC from the ground up exclusively to pick up the HTC Vive after experiencing it at a Microsoft store.  Don't be too concerned with the high requirements; as long as the minimum specs are met, you will have a great experience without breaking the bank.  My specs are: Intel I5 7500, GTX 1060 6GB, 16GB RAM.  Most reviews will tell you to get at least a GTX1070, but the 1060 has been great with Fallout 4VR and everything else I've tried so far.  Set up is not complicated but it does take time, so set aside a couple hours.  Make sure you have all of the correct cables; it comes with an HDMI cable to connect the link box with the GPU, however, my GPU only has 1 HDMI port which I was already using to connect the GPU to my TV, so I needed to go out and grab a display port to HDMI cable.  You can grab one on amazon.ca for about $15, but if you already use a display port cable to connect to a monitor, you'll be okay without.  It's certainly a different sort of experience than traditional gaming, but there really is no way to describe the experience other than to say you will be blown away.  If you have the budget and want the high-end, room scale VR experience, the Vive is the way to go.

The Vive is still my favourite VR headset on the consumer market. Having room scale VR has been a fantasy of mine since seeing the holodeck on Star Trek and immediately asking my mom where we could buy one. I love getting lost in a world that is a little weird and takes some getting used to, but it's still me in it. Unfortunately the Vive pro missteps in several key areas.First off the good points. The image quality is fantastic. I did a side by side with the original Vive and there is a noticeable difference in clarity. Being able to read text from across the room like at an optomitrist office is not able to be done in the original Vive. In the pro i was able to read across the entire play space which is a good 10 feet. This will no doubt become far more important as VR games get more detailed. Another big plus is the strap. It is easy to adjust to basically any head size including my massive head. The frame fits snugly and the foam has enough give that it doesn't hurt my head. The weight is also well balanced. The original Vive was noticeably front heavy. The pro addresses this issue with the heavy duty plastic wrap around design and it does feel more comfortable. This made playing longer sessions much better.What I absolutely cannot endorse are the included headphones. They sound like the old blown out speakers my middle school used in classrooms. For most gamers this may not be a big issue. However, take a look at the number 2 top selling VR game. Beat Saber. A rhythm game with VERY bass heavy music. You do not get the same impact during the song if it sounds like it's coming out of a tin can. Props to HTC for making these removable. I encountered a similar problem with the original Vive, but this issue was resolved by my lovely pair of bluetooth headphones. The super comfy strap unfortunately means that headphones do not sit on your head properly.  This makes waving your arms and head around really challenging which defeats the whole point of VR.The Vive pro definitely proves that it is the best quality consumer headset out there right now. The picture is great and it is more comfortable than its predecessor which might be enough to justify the increased cost for some. For audiophiles like myself it is a disappointment. I will stick with my original Vive for now and hope that the next gen headset can deliver a truly upgraded experience.

I loved it. It was amazing, Everything i wanted. But you may notice a lot of Past tense there. Yeah, SWEAT KILLS IT. If you sweat, it will die. Yeah it takes a good bit of sweat, Like swing your arms wildly in beat Saber (SOOO GOOD) or GORN (yeah fun stuff) or OrbusVR (MMORPG that has a TON of potential and was very fun) You're gonna sweat. I am returning mine, as its dead, Had it less than a week. Yeah ok i played for maybe 2 hours straight, Sweated a good bit, Youd sweat more running on the treadmill, but the face things are sponges, and when they get full it leaks into the system, where it then KILLS YOUR HEADSET. Anyway, this isnt uncommon, And while im sad, i am also happy, Happy that is was better than my high expectations. I bought so much stuff for this, Stands for the Light Boxes, Games, more face things, More games, Cables and adapters. returning it all, because its dead. Dead dead dead.TL;DR I loved it, Its everything you're hoping for, but until they fix the sweat issue (I hear Occulus has it as well) I wont be buying it nor will i be recommending it.

I managed to get a few chances to use the Vive before purchasing this but was still kind of worried since it's so expensive but it has been an absolutely phenomenal experience. Pretty much *all* of the games I've tried on it have been entertaining and there's now a nice critical mass of lengthy or involved games that you can really sink your teeth into VR. I definitely recommend the advanced audio strap though if you're getting this.

Everything works as expected.  Simply amazing VR environment, my amazement is not decreasing it is increasing with every new software or game that I try... Resolution could be better but is more than acceptable and a wireless headset would be even greater.  I love it it provides me with hours of fun discovering all that VR has to offer... Definitely recommended if you can afford it.

As a 35yo, this is awesome. Yes the resolution on this and on the oculus is not as sharp as your hd/uhd TV, but your brain quickly forgets that. Room scale makes it even better if you have the space. Keep in mind that it should be used for any extended period of time by kids unless their pupillary distance exceeds the minimum 60mm..The audio strap is also totally worth it. Much better sound experience than I expected and way faster adjustment for different people playing.

No more long hours sitting on a chair, now I'm up and walking around, dodging bullets, shooting arrows, tossing beach balls, swinging swords, and exploring impossible landscapes.

El HTC Vive tiene un excelente sistema de captura de movimiento, lo malo es que hay que colocar los sensores anclados a la pared o bien comprar tripodes para mayor movilidad.Lo malo es que se necesita una PC muy potente, yo cuento con los requisitos mínimos y algunos juegos si se nota lag grafico y malos FPS. Pero solo es cuestion de actualizar mi tarjeta grafica GTX 1070 por una GTX 1080 TI o superior.

If you don't have a PS4 and are wanting to set into the VR world, this is the ticket. It's expensive to get this VR system going but is a good experience once everything is in place. Don't buy a PS4 just because you're thinking of doing VR. If you have a gaming PC with the newer CPU and video card, this is the way to go. Buying a PS4 with VR will set you back around $1200 CAD. So the Vive being $799.00 CAD on sale was my choice. Then I spent about $500 on a new video card. So about the same price but I believe the quality and depth of programming is better with the PC/Vive Setup.

Pretty good headset, great tracking compared to the rift, and okay controllers.Initially my screen would go grey after 1 min of play time, and this issue was resolved when I removed the overclock on my ram.The FOV is slightly worse than the rift due to the screen and lens being farther away from the eyes, but you can fix this fairly easily (just look it up on youtube).Overall, I'd say its the best VR Headset out right now excluding the Vive Pro as that just has an insane price.What made me return it is the high price and the boredom that sets in quickly, along with the initial issue.

Took a while to set it all up correctly but it’s the most immersive experience. I set my ‘home’ place to be a custom one - a place in England and it really feels like I’m there. Google Earth VR is amazing once you get acquainted with the controls.I’ve been waiting over 20 years for this and I’m legitimately impressed. Wish I could have a massive VR area - I think it should be wireless - that’s my only complaint, the wires detract from the experience. There are ways to extend them but still it needs to be wireless somehow.I really enjoy my Vive, I hope I can play older games using it somehow. I’m eager to see what Doom VR is like ツ

I've realized humans can go with very little sleep. How did I realize that? I've spend the last nights sleeping only 3 hours because I'm completely addicted to VIVE. This is a totally different experience from the ""samsung virtual reality"". This is genuine, realistic, and the quality is so great. I have no lag at all. My settings are 16GB RAM with SSD drive for steam & games, and NVIDIA GTX 1080i. I've VIVE mirroring audio and video to the TV, and it becomes a great entertainment with friends. Lately we have been playing ""3D pictionary"" with Tilt Brush -- simply amazing.It doesn't bother the eyes, I've been playing it for hours. Also, I wear contact lenses.Again, no lag at all, and you can even invert the controllers and move fast (to hit or avoid) and they will follow you.Think no more, if your computer can support VIVE, you should totally buy this. You can also check from the VIVE website if your computer specs are good enough.Now I salute you all, the virtual world is calling for me, and I've some zombies to shoot at.

First off, going to say, you need to fork out a lot of money for this toy, this is not cheap and don't expect a price drop like the RIFT because as Gabe Newell said, Valve's loss of sales on this toy does not affect them at all nor do they care if it ends up as a total failure. That sounds like some really confident people! The great thing about it is supported by Steam not Facebook. I have owned it since Feb. Have to say, I have had no issues at all whatsoever, the hardware is great, top notch, VR is so amazingly immersive, the games are great, just bought a deluxe audio strap too recently, I have no negatives for this headset beside one thing and one thing only. Eye Tracking. VR could really use Eye Tracking. I wish this had Eye Tracking. Other thing is I wish the stock foam didn't suck so much, I sweat a lot and I can only enjoy 2 hours of gaming before taking the headset off. I wish the foam was actually some sweat fighting leather instead. All and all 5/5 from me.

 This is one of my favourite purchases this year.I built a gaming PC specifically for VR.My setup is:Geforce 1080 TI 13GB video cardWater-cooled i7 4.7 GHz 6 core processor16 GB of DDR4 Ram1 TB SSD storageWin 10 ProThis build is perfect for VR.some games I recommend after 1 week of playing:Fruit NinjaSuperhotInto The RhythmPirate Space TrainerBeat SabreGood games for kids:Google Tilt BrushJob SimulatorFruit NinjaThe LabInto The RhythmI have a mild vision problem that requires glasses for night driving and to sharpen small text on the TV when gaming.In VR, my eyes get sore when I don't wear my glasses. Luckily you can comfortably fit glasses in the headset.Some accessories I recommend:-Deluxe audio strap-HMD cable management system that puts the cable over your head.-large display or TV for friends/family to watch along with the VR user.-controller charging stand to clean up the desk.I've upgraded to the Vive from the gear VR. that was really cool, but this is better - and I assume the HTC Vive Pro coming soon will be even better.I recommend you don't let kids play any content with scary situations or blood. Letting them play games that are too life-like is risky to their psyche. It's extremely real feeling scared by monsters, falling in pits or being face to face to a dinosaur.I am careful to make sure my 7 year old daughter sticks to games like fruit Ninja and other cartoony G rated games.Those games are really fun for all ages anyway :)

It's the most fun I've ever had in my life.  If you are a gamer, you are missing out on one of the greatest experiences available if you do not own this.  I haven't used a flat screen for gaming or watching any movie alone since I've owned it.  Also most games require extreme physical interaction and will put your body in amazing shape whether you want to or not.

Very poor software support. You basically need to restart your PC each time to use it, or else after several seconds of having it on your head the screen will go black. Other than that, it works decently. It has a bad case of ""screen door"" effect though, and it may be worth holding out until a sale or the next generation gets released.EDIT: This is not the HTC Vive's fault. It is an issue with the graphics card-- for me, it was my Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB that was having driver issues. Reinstalling the drivers (and updating them when new ones came out) did not fix the issue, but it is not HTC's fault. The headset, now that I've had more time to use it, operates very nicely. However... at this far in the product's stage, I would wait for the next generation to be released instead of buying older tech... if it is reasonably priced. The screen door effect is still bad, but tolerable. I recommend picking up a better face mask on Amazon (12 dollars-ish) if you need glasses. Otherwise... very solid product, especially for its price.

So, I had the Vive for about a week, and I have to say, it is not what I expected at all. I bought a couple games just so I could get a feel for it, such as Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Handgrenades, and Skyrim VR... H3VR was really fun, but after you’ve tried all the weapons and maps, it gets pretty stale and that goes with all the other games I’ve tried.Some of the games that I got, movement wise, made me feel sick instantly. I tried teleporting movement, which is supposed to fix this, and same thing.Overall the build quality and setup process is really easy and it is fun at first, but definitely not worth the $699 CDN price tag.

It costs $600 dollars, and it doesn't even have detachable cables; How am I gonna replace the cables if something should happen to them? It's so easy to step on or trip over the cable too, when using the dang thing.  Not to mention that it's just USB, HDMI and audio lines, not some dumb expensive obscure/proprietary lines; there's no good reason they couldn't have built slots on the thing to allow for detachable cables.The resolution ain't that great either, but it's reasonable enough to enjoy games and It's at least comparable to other headsets, nowadays, plus the tracking, all the way up to room scale, functions way better than any other option on the market.It's uncomfortable to wear, though, and you'll scratch the lenses on it the *expletive* up if you wear glasses (yes, there's nearly no way of avoiding having your glasses rub the lenses, they *have* to sit that close to your face-balls), so purchase/apply either lens protectors or spacers that'll shove your glasses as far into your dang head as possible, first thing.

received item without cables attached to the headset, no protection on the lenses (as im aware it should arrive with it as i have watched many unboxing video), set it up and constantly had error 208 (apparently a common problem), did everything possible to troubleshoot the problem that i have found online, only thing that worked was to format my computer, worked for one session and the same problem occurred, im not willing to format my computer every time i want to play. Ive ran out of solutions to this problem having to deal with this for 3 days and constantly troubleshooting problems.

very good VR, comfortable and since the price has dropped there is no reason to not take advantage of it. I play in a relatively small room and I hit a lot of object and walls. The only downside is that the code for free games does not work, but I still recommend it.

I finally pulled the trigger on buying one of these and for the most part it works perfectly. Mine has one problem though. The track pad on one of wands doesn't depress on its right side and it inhibits the functionality of some games, which really sucks considering i payed ALOT of money for it.Other than that Id have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the damaged wand.

FUN, FUN, FUN but.....VR is in it's infancy and it's still a long ways away from being perfect.  Watching movies or videos you still get that screens door effect.  The graphics in games still need a bit fine of tuning.  However, the HTC Vive still gives that untapped immersive VR experience that wows us.  The games are fun, some games can give you motion sickness like roller coaster simulator.  I like space Pirate Trainer FPS, it gives me a nice workout, you really build up some sweat.  I got VR fun house for free from steam and that games is blast.I bought a used HTC Vive from amazon warehouse deals as per the description there are no codes to download free steam games but there are plenty of free VR steam games to download so no biggy and huge savings buying used.  However, the 2 handset chargers were missing in the box.  I discovered that I can use my cell phone chargers instead to charge the handsets using the micro USB cords.  Still I would like to have the original Vive chargers.Over the HTC Vive is a lot of fun, but I hope 1 day they fix that screen door effect when watching videos and hope for better games to come out.  The future looks promising for VR.Update:  For those who maybe wondering.  I have a GTX 970 graphics card and it runs perfectly smooth and at high frame rates.

Two stars for the condition the product was sent in. Htc vive itself is an amazing product, the interface and vr is breathless. I purchased a warehouse product and gor a good deal. However, when I received the vive I saw that there were lots of scratches on both the controllers. The unit itself hadnt been cleaned also. You could see the sweat marks on the unit from prior use. The lens needed to be cleaned and I am still working on that. Overall the vive itself is amazing but the unit I received left a sour taste in my mouth. I will try to talk to customer support and see if I can exchange it for something cleaner.Edit: Love the unit that was sent to me. I find myself using it less than before but it works great still. Dont like watching tv anymore lol, I spent $4000 on my tv but I like the Imax movie theatre experience in my htc vive. you will not regret this decision. loving mine

This product and VIVE as a company have been a disaster. We gave the system to our family for Christmas. After the first week of use, the headset broke. Rather than send us a replacement, VIVE had us mail the system to their warranty repair center in Texas - at our expense. This cost us an additional $60. We've now been without the headset since January 2, but all we've learned from VIVE -- after we initiated multiple online chats, which is the only way to contact them besides email -- is that the parts needed to repair it are not in stock so we won't get our system back until mid-February. VIVE has not reached out to us or made any effort to fix the situation and there is no way to speak to a representative by phone. Our warranty continues to run the entire time, even though the headset isn't in our possession. Don't. Buy. This. Go with the Rift or Playstation.

UPDATE: Having a known issue with one of the controllers, seems the right trackpad button stops working after a few days/weeks of heavy use, and dealing with their CS and repair process is painful, and I'm being nice by saying that.When you have a known issue like this, for a product that costs as much as this does... you make the process as easy and painless as possible, and extend your replacement policy, it's currently only 14 days!!!I can no longer recommend this product to anyone.The Vive is much easier to set up for ""room scale"" compared to the Oculus Rift, that and not being owned by Facebook are the two biggest reasons I chose to go with HTC. I'm extremely happy with the product, but I'm not convinced the extra price is worth it. At almost double the price it should really come with the new stereo head-strap and upcoming ""knuckles"" controllers that are more inline with what Oculus has to offer right now.That said, it's fun as hell and if you have the money it's an entirely new area of gaming.
