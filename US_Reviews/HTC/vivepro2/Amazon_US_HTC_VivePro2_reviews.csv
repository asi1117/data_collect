Was hoping the negative reviews were over-exaggerated but uh, they're pretty on point.  I wanted to try this out coming from the Valve Index at a time when my cable has gone bad.  Waiting for a replacement, decided to order a backup headset and thought I'd try this out instead of getting a second Index.  But wow.Pros--It weighs less than the Index-Somewhat more comfortable than the Index-Can't really notice a screen door effectNegatives--The closest setting for the lenses is still too far, field of view seems compromised-hard to get everything in good focus, seems to have excessively more glare than the Index, outside a very narrow spot in the center everything else is just too blurred.  Hard to enjoy the sharper resolution.-display is too dim, can't find a way to brighten it-seems to only have 90 or 120 hz modes.  The Index has a 80 hz mode which is particularly useful for certain games.-Terrible audio-Didn't test mic but have heard that is terrible too-$300 more expensive than the Index headsetNot really sure what you're paying for here as an improvement over the Index, the experience is very sub par.  Stick with the Index.

Every VR headset has major flaws and shortcomings, but all things considered I believe the HTC Vive Pro 2 is the best consumer VR gaming headset there is. I upgraded to it from the Valve Index, I'd do it again but there are many things wrong with the Vive Pro 2 as well.Pros:- The fact that it's a SteamVR headset with outside-in tracking and Valve Index controller compatibility- The 4896 x 2448 combined resolution which not only looks far better than 2880 x 1600 screens, it enables you to play games more effectively. This was one of the two main reasons I upgraded to the Vive Pro 2.- Aftermarket addons - from new pads and cushions (which I need) to the HTC Vive Tracker 3.0 for full body tracking (be warned about unreliability and inconsistency with these devices though), Vive Wireless Adapter, Vive Facial Tracker, and hopefully the Droolon F2 soon. The other main reason I purchased this.- Mildly improved FOV compared to the outgoing model- Easily available replacement parts from authorized dealers unlike Valve- Fairly breathable design, doesn't make you sweat profusely. Big improvement over the Index here.Cons:- Poorly calibrated with too much brightness and too little gamma correction. Probably calibrated for 1.8 gamma, and because the overwhelming majority of VR ""games"" lack adjustments for this, I'm stuck with it. Valve Index appears calibrated for the proper 2.2 gamma.- Very expensive, especially considering it doesn't even come with eye tracking despite the fact that the Vive Pro Eye does, and considering it doesn't come with the wireless adapter which still hasn't been updated to support a larger resolution- Very narrow focal sweet spot- Screen uses out of date LCD technology with poor contrast which cannot deliver true blacks- FOV still lower than ideal- Inferior headphone solution compared to the Valve Index- Poor microphone quality- Cable sleeving quality isn't great, seems like it will undergo the same kinking and wear and tear that my Index did, for which the cable is damaged enough to occasionally lose video signal entirely after just 1 year of use. For $799 you'd expect quality sleeving.- Headset cable is prone to being accidentally disconnected from the Link Box very easily- Comfort issues - creates relatively small concentrated pressure points on your head that build discomfort over time- Comfort issues - creates relatively small concentrated pressure points on your head that build discomfort over time. Also, I can't get an ideal fit, which results in the headset being prone to moving around during intense gameplay in games such as Blade & Sorcery (thus losing the focal sweet spot).- Not a weakness of the headset, but HTC has yet to come up with a competitor to the Valve Index controller which themselves are far from perfectDespite all the flaws, this is still my most recommended VR headset for the clarity, addons, and because I only recommend SteamVR headsets due to Valve Index controller compatibility and SteamVR base stations which are as good as tracking gets right now. Also, despite all the flaws, I still consider VR gaming to be a must-have, and it is the way I'd want to play most of my favorite games if it were possible. A lower price could have resulted in a 4 star rating from me.

HTC Vive Pro 2 - The Best of a Bad Situation

The cable that runs from the headset to the PC seems to have some defects. I may have gotten just a bad cable but their customer service made me want to pull my hair out. And I am a streamer too, not that that should matter, but it made no difference to them in terms of wanting to keep a happy customer that was promoting this very headset until I ran into the cable issue and spoke to customer service. They just don't seem to care about backing up what they sell from defects in production or design. It's a shame too.

I am a long time user of the original Vive. I got irritated with the weird gradient lenses so opted for nice clear replacement lenses I found for $50 on the internet. They made the Vive a joy to use. I recently upgraded to the Pro 2 and feel like I took a step back. With all the complaints I’ve read over the years regarding the weird lenses, I find the same lens design in the Pro 2. The only difference is that they are a different shaped lens which says I can’t use the upgraded lenses from the Vive.It’s just an $800 disappointment that with all HTC knows about the poor lens design that they still push a bad idea forward. Nowwe wait for some crafty person to build replacements for the new style. Or maybe return it and move to another brand.

I purchased this as an upgrade for my original Vive System, primarily to play Fallout 4 and Skyrim. I've got about 100 hours into it.The Good:I'm very happy with the upgraded video. The screen door effect is barely noticeable and the game graphics look significantly better, even though I can't even use the full 4896x2448 resolution with my GTX 1080ti. I look forward to replacing my video card and seeing the full headset resolution.The headset is wider than the original, so it fits better and is more comfortable when wearing glasses.Adding the headset was easy, and only took about 15 minutes. Steam VR also support both headsets, so I can swap back and forth easily if I want to.The IPD adjustment process is a definite improvement over the original, and makes it much easier to adjust correctly, especially when used by multiple people.The Bad:My GTX 1080ti can only run the headset at 3672x1836 @ 90Hz.The headset isn't uncomfortable, but it's not as comfortable as the original Vive. I could wear the original headset all day and never notice. This one becomes uncomfortable after a few hours. This may actually be due to the headset being wider to accommodate glasses. When I don't wear them I have to wear it tighter than I'd like since the headset doesn't fit the shape of my head as well as the original headset. I knocked off half a star for this.The Audio from the built-in headphones is bad, and HTC should feel bad given the price. I had to do a ton of tweaking with the Windows Audio Equalizer attached to the sound device to get the audio to sound decent through the headphones. It's noticeably worse than the Original Vive's Deluxe Audio Strap. I knocked off a star for this.Although you can remove the headphones, the head strap is permanent, so you can't wear other over-ear headphones like you can with the original Vive - you'd have to wear earbuds or stick with the included headphones. I knocked off another half start for this.Overall:I did end up keeping the headset as the video upgrade was worth it to me, but I'm still looking for a better audio solution.

I'm a VR enthusiast, currently wielding 10 devices. With HTC, I started with the Vive, then Pro, and now Pro 2.Overall, noticeable improvements and beautiful visuals. Any VR hobby person, enthusiast, or professional will enjoy it and love the updates.My one gear that is being ground right now is that you can't adjust the optical brightness for the eye lenses. There's a lot of places in VR games that are just way too dark (Pavlov especially). I think this has already been addressed by the masses, and HTC will push down an update in the future to make this easy to adjust. Right now, the only option is getting all Matrix on the device and changing some coding yourself.Otherwise, great device.

I feel really disappointed and let down by this headset. It boasts Index quality and specs with even higher resolution displays. While the displays are very high resolution, the FOV is nowhere near the Index level. It's also worth mentioning the Quest 2 has the same FOV for only $299. The audio and microphone quality is laughable, sounding like a smartphone from 2009. I've heard flip phones with better sound quality, and compared to the Quest 2 the Vive Pro 2 gets blown out of the water. It's an overblown, over-advertised, and overrated Quest 2 for 3x the price. In fact, I would choose my Quest 2 over the Vive Pro 2 any day of the week. The headstart is uncomfortable, the face foam is uncomfortable, and it hurts to think I almost bought one of these over my Index. I'm glad I made the right decision. The Index doesn't have nearly high-resolution displays, but at least the Index isn't utter trash. I'm really disappointed with the Vive headsets 2020-2021. Nice work on getting beaten out by the 1st gen Index and Quest 2. I'm getting my $799 money back and believe me, 1 star is being nice about it.

Despite having the most accurate tracking and best visuals of any VR device on the market, the Vive Pro 2 is horribly fragile and unwieldy, in terms of weight, sheer number of cables and extra devices, and setup.The base stations provide slightly better tracking, at the expense of two extra power plugins and clever placement that secures them from physical bumps.  The headset itself has a proxy station, which needs *yet another* power plug, and requires the typical USB + display plugin to the computer, which it combines into a proprietary cord to the HMD.  This cord is unusually heavyweight, which is actually a problem in VR, because you can feel it, and are likely to trip on it, as it snakes around on the ground around you.  It you step on it too much, you can't simply run out to the store and replace it, because it's proprietary!I can't recommend this headset, in lieu of owning a Samsung Odyssey.  The Odyssey is just plain superior, even if the resolution is only 1440p per eye, rather than 2448p.  If you can find an Odyssey+, or a HP Reverb G2 HMD (which is 2160p per eye, but none of the extra device nonsense), you'll be doing yourself a big favor -- the extra rez of the Vive Pro 2 just isn't worth *that* much trouble.

I want to make this clear that this review is meant specifically for those who may be struggling with the same question that I had - is the Vive Pro 2 worth buying if you already own the Vive Pro?Just to give everyone a little background history, I am a hardcore virtual reality enthusiast. I have been using VR extensively since the launch of the original HTC Vive. Over the years I've been fortunate enough to try several different VR headsets, including the PSVR, Oculus Rift, Oculus (Meta) Quest 2, as well as the Valve Index. However, the Vive Pro has been my undisputed favorite ever since its release.So when I heard that the Vive Pro 2 was releasing last year, I was excited to say the least. When I read about the substantial (on paper) improvements in resolution, the wider 120 degree FOV and enhanced refresh rate - I immediately began to debate on which major organ I would sell to acquire this beauty.""WE HAVE TO SEE....WE HAVE TO KNOW..""Vive Pro owners, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but these are my observations after using the Pro 2 in comparison to the Pro:-You will immediately notice that the black levels are not nearly as deep, nor the contrast as vivid asthe Pro. So disappointing. Not as bad as the Valve Index, but it will be a night and day difference to people like me that are used to the awesome OLED panels on the Pro. The new LCD type screens utilized in the Pro 2 does a decent job, but it still looks like everything is a little foggy because the dark areas are washed out. Say goodbye to those wonderful deep blacks and the amazing contrast found on the Pro. I don't understand why they chose to do this, as to me this almost negates the other improvements to clarity. In brightly lit scenes, the Vive Pro 2 shines, but games like Elite Dangerous, where the majority of the scenes are dark, the original Pro absolutely annihilates the Pro 2 in these areas.-Clarity is a noticeable difference however, in terms of viewing or reading things from a distance. In games like Onward, or any games where sniping, for example, might be involved - this clarity proves very useful. However, I did not find any meaningful difference, though the difference on paper indicates otherwise. The improved clarity was noticeable, but once again, I did not feel that it meaningfully enhanced the experience.-I would say the same about the 120hz refresh rate and FOV improvements. While nice, they don't seem to make much of a meaningful difference in the experience. These are, of course, welcome and nice enhancements. But not enough, in my opinion, to justify viewing the Vive Pro as an actual, next generation Vive headset.Ultimately, what it came down to for me was the panel lighting differences. The washed out black is very difficult to accept coming from the deep blacks found on the OLED Vive Pro panels. For me, the washed out blacks is immersion breaking. And it always makes me feel like I'm seeing things through a slight fog.The difference is NIGHT and DAY. If you value the way the colors and contrast pop so beautifully on the Pro, you will most likely find it very difficult to upgrade to the Pro 2.Bottom line is, it's a great headset. But if you're a Pro owner, I do not consider it worth the upgrade. Especially if you enjoy dark games like Elite Dangerous. While it has its paper advantages, the panel lighting on the Pro 2 seems like a step backwards because of the noticeable hit in the deep blacks and eye-popping contrast of the Pro. And the experience is a marginal improvement as a consequence of this baffling design change to the lighting system.Pro still ROCKS guys. Pro 2 is heading back where it came from. That was just my experience with it!

I own both an Index and OG Vive.I purchased this wanting more than the Index was giving me.  I wanted the better resolution, better fov, and my Index was hurting my temples which I never suffered with my OG Vive.It was about the same as the Index for comfort and nowhere near as comfortable as my OG Vive.My OG Vive has the Premium Audio Strap upgrade and I was used to the on ear headphones.  After switching to the Index with it's off-ear speakers, that I thought I would hate, I really didn't like the on ear headphones of the Vive Pro 2.My PC is a running a 3080ti and Intel 12900k.  It has the horsepower to push the extra pixels that the Vive Pro 2 has compared to the Index.  With that said though, the image didn't actually look better.  Switching back and fourth to check if I was crazy was a Hassel and there just wasn't  noticeable difference in clarity.God rays were noticeably worseto my eyes.Increased horiztal fov didn't make the games feel more natural, on the contrary, the reduced vertical fov made it to where you noticeay see the upper and lower boundaries of the screen which was pretty immersion-breaking.Finally, I don't know how they went from the supple cord of the OG Vive, to the thicker, easier to tangle cord of the Index, to the water hose that is the Vive Pro 2 cord.If it was $300 less than the price of the Index and came with all the stuff the Index comes with - I would still prefer the Index.I was immensely disappointed in this HMD and incredibly thankful for Amazon's generous return policy since nobody in a 100 mile radius had one to try.If you're getting into VR, you have a powerhouse of a PC, some disposable income and you want the best tracking and image quality for the money in VR today... get an Index.  If not, a Meta Quest 2 will serve you well.

This is the first review I have ever written on Amazon after purchasing probably hundreds of products. I truly hope it will help others.I am an experienced VR user, having bought the Oculus Rift shortly after its introduction in 2016 and moved up to the Rift S in 2019. I almost exclusively use VR for auto racing and flight sims. My computer is an i9-7980XE with an Nvidia GTX 2080ti, which should be able to exploit the capabilities of just about any VR rig.With its superior resolution, I thought I would try to step up to the Vive Pro 2. I read at least 100 reviews before taking the plunge. I was very disappointed. The improved resolution reduces the ""screen door effect"" somewhat, but in terms of overall image and clarity, the Vive Pro 2 was no better than my Rift S (which I do super sample at 1.7). The focal ""sweet spot"" seemed smaller and the clarity of the image at a distance (crucial for racing and flight sims) actually seemed somewhat worse.The Pro 2 is indeed expensive. I found it heavier and less comfortable than the Rift S and, of course, it requires base stations, which the Oculus does not.I have returned the Vive Pro 2. It may be a good unit for uses other than racing or flight sims. Those who are buying for the first time may want to consider the Oculus Quest2 or HP Reverb G2.  Generally though, it seems that those of us who wish to upgrade should wait for the next generation of headsets, hopefully with better lenses than the Fresnel lenses still used in the Vive Pro 2.

This is very similar to the Vive pro, if you have it. Just higher resolution. To be fair, the resolution is pretty awesome, whether the content you have is that detailed or not. There is NO screen door.Lenses seem like they could be improved, although to be fair they have less fresnel bands than before. (Also, I hope in future models they get to where the lenses can just ""pop out"" so people can experiment freely). None of the headsets are perfect, but I feel like this one is still particularly prone to focus issues and godrays. On the first day I thought it was bad, but after wearing it more and learning to feel exactly where the headset should be, and toying with the IPD and face pad and straps a lot, I realized it's not really that bad if you can just keep the headset placed just right.

Amazon needs to stop bunching dissimilar items together in the review pool of a single item. Categorization is fundamentally arbitrary of course, and I would agree that the Vive Pro and Vive Pro 2 are both VR headsets, but one came out in 2018 and has an OLED display, the latter was released this year and features an LCD of considerable higher resolution. Regardless of the merits of either, they do not belong in the same review pool.

Reform Amazon Reviews

As of this review the Vive Pro 2 has 3.9 stars on Amazon.  That's probably about right. I think this is a four star headset that almost achieved greatness.  Unfortunately it's held back by its price and so-so lenses.I bought this direct from HTC but I'm writing this review because maybe it'll help someone make a decision.  I have owned a Rift CV1, a PSVR, a Reverb G1, a Valve Index, a Quest 2, the Vive Pro 2, and now a Pimax 8kx.  So yeah, I have a problem but I think I also have some perspective on VR headset pros and cons.The challenge with VR is that the hype rarely lives up to the actual experience.  When I first tried the Vive Pro 2, I was disappointed.  The image was not as clear as I expected and the Fresnel lenses produced some serious god rays.  The set-up process was also a bit finicky but not so bad as some others.  I did a lot of side-by-side comparisons and even debated whether to keep the headset.  Ultimately I was able to configure it so that its resolution was very good (better than Index, slightly below Reverb) and it's FOV was very good (although no Pimax of course).  But the process took time and I had to temper my expectations.  It's a good picture but it won't blow you away.Ultimately I think this headset is very good but in a tough spot price-wise.  The Vive Pro 2 is much more expensive than the Index but without a commensurate bump in the user experience.  The Vive Pro 2 is cheaper than the Pimax but the 8kx offers a really unique experience (if you have the rig to drive it).So while I really enjoyed my Vive Pro 2 I have a tough time recommended it at full price.  If you can get it at a discount then it's a fair option.  But it is not what I'd recommend for most users.

Bottom line/TLDR: Too many cons and not enough pros. The hefty price tag is just not worth it right now. Get the Index or wait for the Index 2 or something better.Coming from the Index this headset is a bit of a disappointment. The Index is more comfortable on me because I have to crank this thing down to get the sweet spot to stay in front of my eyes. I would gladly pay for this headset if they removed the issues with focus and the weird circular glare, bigger sweet spot. I might even pay 2-300 more. As it is now, this headset is a hard pass. Unfortunately, I bought it sealed off eBay and honestly I would rather just use it than return it. I'll be selling it as soon as a better device that works with my controller is available.Pros--Noticable upgrade in quality of image (but ultimately dissappointing due to the glare and focus issues)-Can't really notice a screen door effect (as much, it's still there just very very faint) as compared to the Index.Cons--The closest setting for the lenses is still too far, field of view seems compromised-Difficult to get everything in focus correctly, weird circular glare more noticable in a room with a bright object in game-Settings are difficult to find. Would be nice if they allowed SteamVR to take control. I had to set the refresh rate in the Vive application as you couldn't do it in SteamVR.-Audio was ok-$300 more expensive than the Index headset, not justified at all. If I could return this I would but I purchased from another retailer as a ""sealed"" item and I don't think it would be fair to return to them.Also, if you want this with the steam controller, be prepared to shell out more money. The HTC bases, sold individually, on their site do not come with mounts (rip off). They are out of stock at Steam.

I have spent almost 1 thousand hours in vr on my previous HTC pro. That unit worked great. Yes a few small problems but still was a great unit. This new headset looks and feels amazing. I do miss the oled screen for the blacks and bright colors but the 5k screen and 120 fps is worth the trade. Just one problem i noticed is after a long time playing the headset gets really hot and sometimes the screen will flash off for a second or two. Will update this review after more playing.

I am a disabled Veteran business owner with vision problems. I can't see the small screws and pieces and am unable to convince the VIVE customer service person on the online chat self-fix window of this fact. They keep telling me I can fix it like I am some pimple faced teenager that needs the extra motivation and not an older adult with crappy eyes. They do not listen or maybe it is a comprehension problem since they do not appear to speak english as a first language.This expensive paper weight is used in our Real Estate Office and all I want is a local repair shop I can bring it into for repairs. I am not a computer repair person and am quite upset that there is NO PHONE number to call and I have to resort to leaving a bad review.I would NOT buy this product again. The company is NOT set up to support what they are selling and they make no apologies about it. A complete waste of time and money and they treat businesses like teenage gamers!

The whole thing just deteriorated over time pretty quickly. First the nose guards fell off. The controllers stopped working so I bought valve index controllers (MUCH BETTER!). The eye adjustment started sliding. Mic would work randomly.  Audio became static noise and sometimes wouldn’t work at all.  Then it began having troubles connecting to the graphics card. My guess is over time the cord connection got loose internally.  Here’s hoping the Valve Index Headset will by better!

This thing ran into so many problems before I could get it working and it’s still not working on many games. Also it’s retarded it’s only sold headset only when you need the whole set.And I just bought the 3080ti and installed it hoping it would fix the glitchy VR I been experiencing upgrading from the 1060. Well it didn’t fix the glitching out but the frame rate went up noticeably as expected. But still the FPS is below 30 for DCS world. All I been trying to do was play DCS world in VR at near max graphics settings and resolution on my VIVE Pro 2. I spent lots of time trying to fix the buggy display but have barely progressed. I think it might be the game engine itself or steamVR and not a hardware problem. But the issue is it looks like a video that got corrupted. Like not all the time as sometimes it’s worse than the another. I can’t find out why it’s acting this way but it seems worse at loading screens.Also when I first put the headset on I was completely disappointed. Like this thing being this expensive didn’t have the quality I was expecting. The build quality is like just average and the display isn’t as clear as I expected. I’m not even sure it’s really 5k resolution. I had the feeling a lot of the resolution is lost around the edges as in order to get the maximum viewing angle to see the most out your headset you have to tighten it up to the point where it’s like pressing 50 pounds of force into your face. Basically it’s like the lens crops the 5k display so you only see the middle area while a lot of the edge of the display is lost by the type of lens they used. Compared to oculus if you gave someone a test between the two then the oculus would probably look better at first. The lens on the pro are kinda weirdly shaped and give an annoying halo glare that always seems to be there. Definitely can ruin your experience if you focus too closely. But just relaxing and enjoying the entire VR experience it’s not too bad… if only it didn’t cost as much as they’re selling it.The comfort is manageable for me but I can imagine it being a headache for many.Most important thing is to make sure you have your base stations. This is still sold headset only at the time of writing this which is stupid. It will only give you a white screen. I learned the hard way but after installing a base station it started working. But you should use 2 for better tracking. I still haven’t received my controllers yet so I’m limited to a few games. I feel like technology is becoming one giant mess. This is something that should be sold in a set. But now after all the problems I faced it tells me that this headset isn’t something that was ready to be released yet. Like this is something they would let beta testers have. I’ve seen the error message pop up so many times saying my headset could not be detected. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t. I’ve just been so frustrated getting this thing to work. As of right now I have not been able to get this headset to perform perfectly without bugs/glitches.*sighs* All I want is for them to use their sales wisely to improve their products and the future of VR. They should be making lots of profit from this for sure because it feels like I’m receiving trash relative to how much I paid. They better use my money to sort of all these glitches because if they release another headset with all these bugs that basically makes VR unplayable then it’s game over for them.Since VR is still new to the gaming industry all these glitches are to be expected. But in my experience most of the times it’s completely unplayable. How disappointed would you be if you bought a headset for $800 then realize you need to spend $400 to buy the base stations then another $400 on the controllers then you find out it’s full of glitches and unplayable for the most part.I believe VR is the future to nearly everything but at this moment in time there’s gonna be a lot of frustration trying to get things working. Lots of money will be spent and little improvements will be seen. Most of this is probably comparability issues as all PC’s are different. The all in one VR is definitely what I recommend for those new to VR. And those trying to upgrade to PC VR should just wait unless okay with spending lots of money on a headset that runs into nothing but problems.

I really wanted to like this headset. The wide field of you is fantastic. The balance of the headset is pretty good on your head, considering it’s quite heavy. It is not uncomfortable. Now to the bad. Felt like I spent a week and a half just trying to get it optimized. The Vive interface that you have to use is not very user friendly. It’s very limited in what it can do. The sweet spot on this headset is extremely tiny and anything off the sweet spot is blurry. I was looking to get something to have a better field of you and have almost as good of visuals in the G2 but this headset just doesn’t do it and the VP2 is quite a bit more money With no inside out tracking. Also the response time was double that of the G2, I noticed. The sound quality in the headphones is not good at all like everybody says.  My left speaker started cutting in and out within the first week of delivery. Either blown or bad connection. (3090, 9700k, 64g ram)

I keep in HTC vive brand as my car in Ford family. Well I had vive, vive pro. Then I got vive pro2. What concerning the headset graphic is probably the best on market. Problem was shaking picture and sometime frozen in game. Returned through Amazon (very easy)Then I got full kit Pro 2 from Vive Canada. Same problem.This time I did not consider to return without trying to fix it. And : fix was simple, disconnected cable on head side and reconnected. It did wor for that session. But when after session I unplaged head from pc and tried again Igot the same problem. Anyway to make it short seems problem is not a cable itself. Just the connection between headset and cable I think. When I did the same disconnect /reconnect dancing it did work again. Then after sesion I did not unplug headset from pc and next session did work again fine.Coincidence? Maybe. I like vive pro2 and I recommend this product. Just letting you know what you may expect.

its not the worst vr headset like other comment explain but its not perfect. first the audio is not that good like a valve he need more bass because when you play its sound like a cane or like it was far away. but the clarity on this is wow and really i come from a quest 2 and the quality of the lentile to its better. not that worst but all is good for me but the only remaing for me its the audio its not trash but its like 7/10 and valve its 10/10.
