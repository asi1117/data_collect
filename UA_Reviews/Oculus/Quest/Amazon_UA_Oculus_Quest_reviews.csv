After having own the occulus (original) I wanted a different experience.The improvement in resolution and having no wires fixed all the main complain I had with the first oculus.This is not a perfect product (it could have a higher resolution a faster CPU) but in  2019 this is the best compromise you can get! if you pay more you probably will not get a much better experience

Honestly one of my favorite purchases. The Oculus Quest provides an immersive and wire-free VR experience.For people that do not do extensive research on the product, I just want to let you know that since this is a standalone VR headset (not connect to a computer or PS4), the processing power is derived from a mobile processor. The games are amazing, but do not use this headset for streaming Netflix or any video as the resolutioncan not keep up with the processing power. I knew this prior to purchasing which is why I am giving this a 5 star rating.

I thought this was a scam at first, but this is legit. This is a really good virtual reality headset and you should definitely get one soon since it is currently recieving major updates that kill the Oculus Rift series and HTC Vive series. 100% worth the money on quarantine.

There are a lot of positive reviews for this headset, but I feel like there's a lot of problems that people didn't detail about. I bought this optimistically, thinking it would be amazing, but there was a lot of trouble I experienced during its set up and use. This is a bit of a long read, but please bear with me.First off, you NEED, and I mean NEED, a (newish) smartphone with an Internet connection to set up the Oculus Quest. You can't even emulate an Android to do it. You CANNOT avoid that requirement whatsoever. In my case, I didn't have any smartphone that wasn't old, so I had to call a friend over to use his to get it set up. You also need Wi-Fi, preferably 5 GHz. There is no PC activation with the Quest; heck, the Quest can't even connect to the PC without a third-party hack. Don't expect this headset to be the same as a Rift, because it isn't. It is purely standalone, and you're stuck with its own Oculus app store. Plus, you must connect your Facebook account to the Oculus AND provide payment details (e.g. credit card info) in order to complete registration. This is a huge privacy issue that many will not like.The Oculus app store doesn't have a lot of apps in it, let alone free. All the apps that are available are easily upwards of $20 a pop. This doesn't bother me too much since my sole reason for buying it was to wirelessly watch 360 videos on YouTube VR, but for others, it will be a major turnoff, since the Quest doesn't come with any free games, just demos. For such an expensive headset, you'd think that Oculus would be generous enough to bundle some free full games with it, but I guess they just want to milk their customers with the novelty and hype.The headset itself is heavy and a bit uncomfortable. It constantly sags forward no matter what you try to do, so you'll often need to support it with your hands. The cushion that goes on your face isn't really that great either; it feels like it pushes in on random spots.Another problem I experienced, which Oculus needs to address, is quality control. The lens that came with my Quest had permanent streaks on the INSIDE, which you can't avoid seeing. It almost felt like the headset was refurbished. It's not too bad during bright scenes, but anywhere else, I see them blurring my vision. I'm not going to get an exchange for something like that now that I've gone through such a pain to get it set up, but Oculus seriously needs to get better quality control.Overall, aside from all of those issues, the headset itself is nice and does what it is intended to do, but the video quality is really poor for 360 videos (other apps seem to be fine though). I don't know if it's just because most YouTube content is still at low resolution right now, but it feels like I'm watching 480p video most of the time. This is likely not a Quest issue though; it's probably the same no matter what headset you buy.As a beginner ""early adopter"" headset, this is pretty good for its price, but that's about it. I'd stay away from VR headsets for at least a few more years, since the technology still isn't perfect. In my particular case, since I'm strictly planning to use a VR headset for 360 videos, I'm content, but for people looking to immerse themselves in gaming, I'd recommend not doing so for now. There's still not enough content, quality, and performance to justify the price.

信者臭く絶賛したり過剰なアンチ過激派並に扱き下ろしたりせず、あくまで平等にQuestとRiftSの長所と短所を紹介していきます。まず届いてすぐ必要なセットアップです。Questは必ずスマートフォンが必須なのですがスマホのアプリから画面の指示通りにすれば良いだけです。ただQuestの画面で更新をインストールしていますという表示のまま進まないバグに遭遇しました。私の場合はwifiルーターをBUFFALOからNECに変えると問題なくセットアップ完了しました。RiftSはPCでOculus Rift Sソフトウェアを使用してセットアップします。発売当初は問題がたくさんあったようですが現時点でバグはほぼ潰されているためスムーズに完了できました。ただソフトウェア上のダウンロード及びインストールが遅くかなり時間を取られました。RiftSはダイヤル式ヘイローバンドが標準装備の561gRiftS本体は軽量化を優先したためプラスチッキーで質感は高価には見えませんが、実際に装着すると頭をリングのように挟むので装着感がよく長時間プレイにも不快感がありません。若干は前に重量の偏りがありますがヘイローバンド含めての重量ですので、全体として前後への重量の分散ができており装着感は良かったです。Questはベルクロストラップ装備の571gQuestは独立型のためバッテリーやCPU周りの電子部品などいろいろと詰めてしまっているのでかなり重いです。つければわかりますが目の下や頬骨あたりが痛くなる方がほとんどと思われます。全体の重量だけを見れば数値上は変わらないのですが、その重量のほぼ全てが本体によるもののためかなり前に重量が偏っています。トラッキング性能（コントローラーの追跡）は搭載しているカメラが一つ多い分RiftSが優秀でした。弓を引く動作やアサルトライフルを構えるといった頬に片手が近づく動作で特に違いが出ます。ただQuestもトラッキング性能は十分高いので強い不満が出ることはないでしょう。音響はQuestのほうが良かったです。Questはイヤホンの装着などしなくても低音こそ割れたり足りなかったりしますがちゃんと使えます。両モデル共通ではありますが耳をふさがないので閉塞感がなく開放的が気持ち良いです。RiftSがここが一番の欠点でまず最大で出せる音が小さくラジオ並の音質しかありません。なのでRiftSはヘッドホン、またはイヤホン装着は必須です。RiftSは液晶なので発色が目に優しく解像度が高いですが沈むような黒の表現はありません。Questとくらべるとあっさりした画調に見え明らかに遠くの方まで鮮明にくっきり見えます。液晶ですが動画に対しての応答性も高く残像感は感じませんでした。Questの有機ELは確かに深い黒と発色は鮮やかなのですが調整されているのか赤の発色がキツく感じました。解像度も数字では高いQuestですが実際は細い先がギザギザザラザラでゲーム中も気になります。実はQuestは解像度をカタログ上だけ高く見せるペンタイルという表示方法が使われています。本当の実行解像度は片目1306×1175となりあまり高解像度ではないことがわかります。Questの有機ELのメリットは黒が本当に真っ黒であることと鮮やかな発色です。デメリットとして液晶よりも発熱が多くヘッドセット内が熱くなるため長時間は快適ではないです。フレームレート（一秒間に表示される画像の枚数）はQuestが72枚、RiftSが80枚です。微妙な差に思えますが両機を視聴するとRiftSがなめらかな動画になるのを体感できると思います。もちろん見た目の違いがわからないという人もいますが酔いやすさの違いは出てきます。IPD（瞳孔間距離）は統計を取った成人の平均的な距離に対応しています。鏡と物差しで左右の黒目の感覚を図ってみてください。RiftSのIPDの対応範囲は60～68mmと比較的広いため範囲内なら快適に使用できます。多少ならオーバーしても使用できないほどの違和感はないですが視界端が若干ぼやけます。Questはスライダーで物理的に移動できるので対応できるIPD範囲はかなり広いです。58～72mmに調節可能で、IPDの対応範囲56～74mmをカバーしています。眼鏡利用時のつけやすさはQuestのような機構の方が装着が簡単です。RiftSだとメガネが引っかかってなかなかコツが必要で難しいですが、まず目の下あたりに当ててから後部を下げて頭にかぶせる感じです。Questは完全ワイヤレスで動き回ってもケーブルが体にまとわりつかず超快適です。ゲームはQuest専用でないとだめなのでPCVR所持者でも同じゲームを新規購入しないといけません。（QuestのPCVR対応機能であるOculusLink利用時を除く）RiftSは有線ケーブルですが一本でまとまっているためそこまで扱いにくくないですが、その分だけ太さが結構あるので柔軟性に優れるとは言えません。踏んづけたり絡まったりしても耐久性はありそうではあります。PCVRの公式サポートであるOculusLinkについては公式のQuest用ケーブルが79ドルと高価です。日本に出荷する場合は1万円近い値段となるでしょう。最初からPCで高画質なVR体験がしたいならRftSのほうが安価です。OculusLink（QuestのPCVR機能）は純粋な映像ではなくかなり圧縮してQuestに送るため圧縮処理の遅延と画質低下は避けられません。多少上級者向けの方法である無線でQuestに接続するALVRやVirtualDesktopでも画像が圧縮転送される時に RGB から YUV 4:2:0 に変換されるため沢山の色情報を失います。その影響で色合いが狂ってしまったりグラデーションが汚くなったりの弊害があります。便利ではありますが良いことばかりでないことは理解する必要があります。事実RiftSと同等の体験には届かないとOculusでも公言されています。ですがPCVRに触れたことがない方にも窓口が増えたのは素晴らしいことです。RiftSはPC所有でGTX1050Ti、GTX1060などの安価なグラフィックボードでもちゃんと動作してくれます。QuestはPCをお持ちでない方、ワイヤレスを体験したい方、フィットネスゲームが主にしたい方向きです。どちらが優れているとか勝っているなどという評価は成長著しいVR業界では意味がありません。自分の用途にあっているかいないかが大事です。

Wow!!! Its the very first word that i said as i put on this headset. Amazing Product, and Delivery time was also great. And product reaches me fine and is working great. Amazing graphics quality and with the latest update Quest is getting better and better. Tho it has some pros and cons. You dont need high end Gaming pc for playing VR games now. No need of wire and external sensors. Now you have gurdian mode in which one can see if hes crossing the line and camera will open up so that you wont hit any object in real life. Pixels are fine. Controller tracking are good as well. Cons will be like product too much costly as i know its not available in india and import duties are expensive. You need to buy games in Oculus store only free demo of games will be provided. Games price ranges from 9$ to 29$. Front heavy but with some modding it can be work. Now you can play PC steam VR gaming with the use of Oculus link cable, so its a standalone headset as well as pc headset as well. Its a bit expensive in india but i like the purchase that i made. Great and Amazing product.

It is great but you need to keep some things in mind before you buy. First, you need a mobile phone to do the initial setup. Comfort- I find it pretty good for about an hour then the contact points on my face start to get irritated.  THis isnt a huge problem because I can only play for 2 hours anyways before the batteries are getting low. 2 hours of gaming is long enough for me.  Ive tried HTC vive pro and Vive, both of which need a powerful PC to work. BOth didnt feel any more comfortable to me than the quest. I also didnt feel any video resolution difference between any of them was worth noting (vive seemed worse but it was still enjoyable) but I also only like watching movies in 720p max because I dont like 1080p. Being wireless and not reliant on a computer is great but the option will be there in NOvember to connect it to a powerful gaming computer and give you access to the Oculus Rift games library on Steam. I find the Oculus controllers were way more comfortable and nicer to use than HTC  (personal preference I am sure). I spent alot of time between spending a massive amount on $$$ on a fancier headset but in the end, I loved the controllers better than the HTC, I love the portability of the headset (people at work can try it), it is super simple to setup, no messing around with sensors, just draw a circle around you with the controller and start playing.  I loved that it is ANdroid and there is a large unofficial sideload site for games and I love that I still have the option to play all the steam VR games so I have all the same options for games as any other headset and the price is right.

If you want to get into VR, this is THE product to buy. Here's why:1. No wires. Nothing to wrap around your neck and take you out of the experience.2. Set up is easy. So much easier than any other high end vr headset.3. The library is growing quickly. It launched with 60 great games, and will be 100+ by the end of it's first year.If you're on the fence, just check out other reviews online. There is a reason why everyone is giving this near perfect scores.

This is a great upgrade of Oculus Go. The rendering Quality is pretty good, with almost no Dithering.  360 degree photos look awesome especially since you can move around. The Guardian is a bit of a pain since it keeps getting reset.This is a very good buy and a better value for money compared to Rift, if you compare the ease of use, no wires, but still have the ability to move aroundHowever, if you have a very powerful Desktop/Laptop with a high end GPU, then I would recommend going for Rift.

My 14 year old wanted this to replace his Oculus Go that he got last year. He found he was not using the GO, as gaming was not great. The Quest is definitely a step up and rather a neat concept, where you can set boundaries and play. The games are good, but a couple issues where the device was not perfect for our family. First our ceilings in our basement are only 7.5 feet tall and many of the games required hands above the head and you hit the ceiling. So our living room was the only room it worked in, but this is not s gaming room. Next my boy loves playing online with his friends, as he was the only one who had the system this could not happen. Lastly the video is good, but not perfect. I am sure Oculus could make it better, but suspect that would raise the cost too much. So in the end after playing extensively for a week the device began to collect dust and we sent it back.

Está excelente, no me arrepiento para nada de esta compra y se las recomiendo por completo!!Las únicas cosas que no me agradaron tanto es que no hay muchos juegos disponibles todavía (lo cual no es sorpresivo porque tiene poco tiempo en el mercado) pero lo bueno es que están agregando varios juegos de manera regular a la tienda, por lo que muy pronto eso ya no será un problema. Otra cosa es que si te enfocas demasiado en un lugar se pueden apreciar los pixeles. Si buscas un VR con la MEJOR calidad de imagen tal vez este no sea para ti. Eso no es para decir que las gráficas son de mala calidad, ya que definitivamente si tiene buena imagen. Si puedes dejar eso a un lado, te garantizo que te encantará.Es increíble poder jugar en realidad virtual sin tener ningún cable que se esté enredando en tus pies y entorpeciendo la experiencia. Para la gente que no tiene computadoras que pueda correr juegos en buena calidad, el Oculus Quest es la oportunidad perfecta ya que no requiere usar computadora para correr juegos. Todo se encuentra dentro del visor.Hay algunos juegos donde te puede dar nausea o mareo ya que el nivel de intensidad es muy alto; pero afortunadamente si eres de los que se marean fácilmente, la mayoría de los juegos tienen ajustes para reducir dicha intensidad y jugar de manera más cómoda y tranquila.Fuera de los juegos, el visor también cuenta con aplicaciones como Youtube donde puedes ver videos excepcionales e increíbles en VR en muy buena calidad. Si quieres ver tus series favoritas también puedes ver Netflix en el visor,  lo cual les recomiendo intentar ya que es una experiencia diferente e interesante. De momento no cuenta con aplicaciones como Hulu o Crunchyroll, pero afortunadamente sí cuenta con un browser para acceder a los sitios que quieras directamente.Si es tu primer headset de VR entonces no tengo duda de que te va a dejar encantado. Todos mis amigos que lo han intentado se han quedado impresionados por la inmersión que sientes al estar dentro del Oculus Quest y ya están haciendo planes también para comprarlo. Usar el Oculus Quest es entrar a un universo completamente nuevo y diferente al de la realidad y te sentirás como si de verdad estuvieras en el universo de lo que sea que estés jugando/viendo.En resumen, si tienes dudas sobre si vale la pena o no comprarlo, yo te diría que es una experiencia realmente increíble y divertida, ampliamente recomendada. No conozco a nadie que lo haya intentado y que no le haya gustado. El precio además es accesible si lo comparas con otros headsets. Dale una oportunidad al Quest y ya verás que no te arrepentirás.

Everything about the Quest is incredible, but it has two major flaws, it is too front heavy and really uncomfortable, strapping a weight to the strap that wraps around the back of the head helps, but this shouldn't be necessary for a device of that price, the second flaw is that casting to a TV is barely functional, there is an up to 10 seconds delay and the image is highly compressed and constantly stutters, with that said I decided to keep the Quest and I'm having a blast so far.

So I've used all the big VR devices up to this point and I feel the Quest is the beginning of where the mass market can finally get into them.Having it be wireless reduces all the setup that's normally associated with any headset. Convenience goes a long way.ComfortWhile the PSVR is my vote for most comfortable headset, primarily cause of the weight distribution and how airy the inside feels, the quest fits nice and feel solid. I got a little warm after about 2 hours of playing, my forehead was sweating after running around my living room beating up robots. But it felt appropriate, not too hot, just sweat from playing an active game.Image Quality and PerformanceThe quest had no noticable screen door effect, one of my biggest issues with the Vive, and throughout my initial play sessions never had a stutter or graphic issue. It played nice and smooth. I didn't feel sick. And more demanding games like Robo recall ran flawlessly.TrackingFlawless. Hands, head, and room. No issues with any. Makes room vr sensors seem prehistoric. And from opening the box to being in a game took maybe 4 minutes (excluding a software update that took about 5 minutes).FeaturesOne of the most interesting built in features is casting. I can send the headset image to my phone, and then to other devices, with just the hit of a button. You can also record and other things. That's very nice when you're showing someone who is less familiar with VR, since you can follow along with them on your phone. Also probably good if you're into streaming and all that.SoundI think I'll end up buying the official oculus headphones. Not cause the sound isnt good, it is, but because I want to play quieter. The speakers are pretty loud.And as a final note, I get about 2.5 hours of playtime before deciding to charge it. It comes with a very long USBC cable and works well with battery packs.My only complaint so far is the battery slider on the controllers is in a very.. weird spot. And they can slide if you're gripping too hard and jerk around. Not a deal breaker, just weird. Easily fixed with a tiny piece of tape or something. Or not holding the controller in a way that could cause the battery case to slide open.

VR is really awesome, much more awesome than any youtube video can make it look like and Oculus Quest is a great implementation of VR. If you've already tried ""phone to the face VR"" understand that this is a very different type of experience, and Oculus Quest delivers all the key features.You feel immersed in the world, the games are fun the controllers feel great. Battery life is about 2 hours on a full charge, and while it might sound short don't compare it to a Nintendo DS's 5-8 hours or the like .. as you don't really carry this with you on the bus. You can play and charge if you want really long play sessions.Low point(s) are some potential discomfort due to the weight of the device and the so-so speakers. With regards to comfort, I've played around with the adjustable straps and found a good position that works with my rather large head. With regards to sound, the speakers are serviceable but not very loud and gun shots or music will lack bass, but you can easily plug your own headphones with a 3.5mm jack (I don't recommend Bluetooth due to general latency).All paid games I've tried were a lot of fun, and even the free to play games were great. If you've had the itch to try out VR, you can't really go wrong with the Quest.

Un visor de realidad virtual que sin duda esta revolucionando el entretenimiento, si no tienes una computadora/laptop para VR, estos visores sin duda son la mejor opción ya que no la necesitas, solo lo linkeas con un smartphone, y se pone mejor con el oculus link, ya que si en algún momento llegases a tener una computadora lista para VR, conectando vía USB el visor, ocuparas un cable para esto, podrás disfrutar de los juegos de VR que tengas en PC.Es un paradigma muy bueno para el VR, totalmente portable, compacto y cero cables, a no ser que lo conectes a PC como ya mencione, lo único malo, creo yo, es que los touch controller necesitan de baterías AA, pero nada que no se pueda resolver con baterías AA recargables.

Battery life night not be enough for some, and limited range of titles right now (though fair for launch). But being able to ditch the cable is undoubtedly the highlight for me over the more expensive Vive (which I also own). A genuine game changer. Highly recommended.

The right controllers was int working since the beginning. The seller (Slidecart Electronics) had promised to replace the item and in the end no response from him. The service centers are not there in India so stuck up with a faulty controller and unable to use. After using for some months the left controller also stopped working. A big waste of money. The experience of the product is good but no ways to replace it , service it or at-least buy a new controller separately from India.

L'oculus Quest n'a aucun fil donc aucun problème pour vos mouvements, les jeux comme Beat Saber, Drop Dead, SUPERHOT et BoxVR sont addictifs et fantastiques avec l'immersion, et pour moi, il est super confortable. De plus, si vous avez des lunettes, un espaceur est inclus afin de jouer tout en les gardant sur votre visage.C'est un must-have pour tout ceux qui aiment la technologie et s'amuser.Je comprend qu'il peut paraître cher, mais il en vaut le prix.

So much fun, and only getting better as more games are becoming available.As a stand alone unit it works simply and intuitively, my daughter (9) can set it up for a session on her own.It has the ability to also play linked to your PC, from there you can access and play Oculus Rift games, ""sideload"" many more games either by independent coders or still in development, or access many VR games only available on Steam, though this was a lot trickier there are tutorials available to guide you though the process. To play Rift and Steam games on your Quest your going to need a decent PC to run them as all the game processing is done by your PC and streamed to the Quest headset.Is 64GB version enough?? Sure seems to be, 4 weeks later and i havnt filled it yet. VR games on a whole dont seem to require much storage space, mostly they are around 1GB each.

The Oculus Quest is the first VR device for me to have a hands-on experience. The headset fits comfortably and the straps can be adjusted to your liking. Audio speakers are pretty decent, although you have the option to use third-party ear buds. Some people have complained about the weight issue in the front but I have no problems whatsoever. The touch controllers feel grippy and has wrist straps so you don't have to worry about dropping them. Battery cover is also magnetized which I find it to be neat and convenient for quick access. There are a plethora of games in the Oculus store and I'm in love with Beat Saber! This device is very portable and family friendly because there's no cable involved and the setup is quick and easy. Oculus released their 'Oculus Link' cable which allows you to connect to your PC. An added bonus twice the fun!I highly recommend the Oculus Quest as it is priced lower than other devices, and it allows one to experience VR in a more convenient way without the cables and motion sensors hassle that are involved with other VR devices. You'll have a ton of fun whether by yourself or with family and friends! I look forward to the future of VR technology.

My only complaint about this headset is that the minimalist exterior design is so sleek they actually hid the important setup buttons (like how to power it on for the first time). I also ran into a slight issue updating the firmware on both controllers during the initial setup -- for some reason it ""forget"" the controller during the update and setup, and the controller was needed to continue. A quick reset fixed the issue and then I was back in business.Once everything was set up, the rest was amazing. We tried playing around in the tutorial, which by itself was enough to blow our minds -- the graphic quality is incredible considering this thing is running on a snapdragon. I guess my expectations were pretty low, but everything was crisp, colourful, and extremely detailed.After completing the tutorial we decided to grab Vader: Immortal, Episode 1 and that really was the icing on the cake. Unlike the tutorial, which goes for a more animated approach, Vader: Immortal made you feel like you were a character in the movie. The first time Darth Vader approaches you in the game you'll find yourself breathless... it really is cinematic quality VR.I have a little Plex server set up as well... to my surprise, I figured up the pre-installed movie system and started watching *cough* home videos on a screen the equivalent size of an Imax. The quality on the movie was very crisp... I was a little worried it might be a little gimmicky. It's probably the equivalent of watching a 1080p movie on a 72"" screen in real life.The next thing we tried was some of the free YouTube 360 videos. Within a minute I was on stage watching Ed Roland (Collective Soul) from 2 feet away, followed by some Switchfoot, and about a dozen other bands. We decided to change gears and went for some underwater videos swimming with sharks. The 6 degrees of freedom is crazy in these videos.Finally, in real life I get motion sick as a passenger in a vehicle. I was worried that the Quest's 72Hz refresh rate would make the whole thing unplayable. To date, there has only been one video I played that made me feel a bit queezy and I think it was something to do with how the video was created. Even the fast motion stuff in games hasn't bothered me -- but, I haven't spent more than 30-45 minutes a time playing (because everyone in the family is fighting to play around with it).Overall, this felt like an ""on the fence"" purchase but I have zero regrets. It was our family's first VR purchase... considering its just marginally more expensive than a console, and given the gaming, movie, and educational content, I would say you get far better bang for your buck with this thing than a console.

No se por donde empezar... el oculus QUEST es un producto que cambió mi perspectiva el VR. Los seis grados de libertad (prácticamente es que no se necesitan cables, ni una gaming PC) además de lo intuitivos que son los controles me dejaron bocabierto.Adicional a que de por sí los controles ya eran excelentes, ahora también están desarrollando la opción para que con tus propias manos puedas jugar. Los juegos son baratos a comparación de los de otras consolas (switch, xbox, ps4) ya que oscilan entre los 10 y 30 dls.Es una excelente consola y el grado de inmersión que tiene es brutal. Sin lugar a dudas la mejor compra que pude haber hecho y más por el precio que fue alrededor de 9,000 mxn por la versión de 64 gb.Honestamente no se ocupan más gb si no piensas descargar películas, ya que actualmente tengo instalados alrededor de 25 juegos y aún tiene bastante espacio.Lo recomiendo ampliamente.

Soy una persona que crecio sin videojuegos y nunca tuve la curiosidad de comprar consolas. Un dia vi un video de Beat Saber y quise saber mas al respecto. El hecho de jugar en realidad virtual me parecio muy atractivo. Lamentablemente, en ese entonces, 2017, los visores de realidad virtual eran muy costosos y privativos a tener computadoras con tarjeta de video potente.Supe del Quest en enero 2020 y en cuanto supe que era una opcion portable, me decidi a comprarlo para probar Beat Saber. El precio me parecio elevado ($9000 en ese momento) pero aun asi decidi comprarlo. Aun con ese precio, es una oferta accesible, tras comparar con otros visores de realidad virtual. En muchas reseñas se critican los graficos del visor, pero sinceramente no experimente ningun detrimento en la calidad de los graficos ni afecta en la inmersion. La bateria del visor dura aproximadamente 2 horas. Unas baterias recargables para los controles duran una semana y media jugando entre 1.5 y 2 horas diarias.La mejor compra que he hecho en mucho tiempo. Vale cada centavo que he pagado.

I love the system.  It is fast, clear and flexible.Unfortunately one of my controllers died after less than a month (no physical damage) and Oculus support is slow to respond and requires up to 12 business days when they finally get around to sending me a shipping label (they are being evasive).  They are currently ""looking into this further"";  it is simply defective and they are being slow and evasive.  I suspect they are either short on parts or the support rep is being useless but required to respond with something to meet an SLA.  This is crap.  I want my product fixed and the support is useless.  It has been a week since I got any useful reply.If your unit has any issue in the first month I recommend returning it rather than attempting to deal with oculus support.

I would give this a 5 star review - the games are fun, there's lots of them, and the 2 hour battery life is more than enough because you actually get tired playing. BUT you only get one account, one avatar, one user, per headset. This is beyond disappointing. If I play a bunch of levels and then my husband wants to play, he has to start the game where I left off. I played halfway through the Vader Immortal game, then all he could do is chapter select or watch from where I was. There is no way to add a second oculus account and there is no way to add a second avatar within an account. The only way you can save games separately is to make two oculus accounts, buy each game twice, and then factory reset the headset and reload the account every time you switch users.

Having used an HTC Vive, and a Rift 1, I can say I'm VERY happy with the Quest.  Biggest factor is convenience.  No sensors to set up, no software to install, convenience of purchasing Apps from the App store but NOT a walled garden (can side load Apps from elsewhere).  I use it in 4 rooms, and it remembers my guardians in each room.  Just put the headset on and go.The quality is not as high as a headset connected to a $4k gaming machine, but I don't really notice the difference, and you can connect to a gaming PC if you want.Things don't like.Face pad is rough on my skin (will likely buy an aftermarket pad).Very inconvenient watching media, with the volume on the headset, and needing to fumble for a controller to ff/rewind/pause.  Screen color balance is poor.-1 star because I don't trust Facebook.

Creo que es un excelente producto, se nota mucho la calidad de los materiales, diseño y hasta el empaque. Lamentablemente creo que por la crisis, desabasto, aumento del dolar, se ha hecho dificil conseguirlo al precio justo, y a veces la relacion costco-beneficio podria no ser tan buena dependiendo a cuanto lo consiguen.Para los que nunca han usado un headset de VR es una experiencia impresionante, desde los tutoriales hasta los videos que existen en la plataforma, son bastante inmersivos y es otro tipo de sensacion que no se compara con las consolas tradicionales. Los juegos podrian ser sencillos, no tan largos, ni demandantes graficamente, pero eso no le quita puntos por que estas consolas apenas estan empezando. Aun asi hay otros headsets (Valve Index) que pueden lograr este tipo de graficos, solamente que son de un costo mucho mayor y se requiere una computadora con ciertos requerimientos.Para los que estan pensando comprarlo y usar un cable USB C (Link) para jugar juegos de computadora, mejor hagan su investigacion y configuren Virtual Desktop, necesitan un modem que soporte la banda de 5GHz, y obviamente una computadora ""gamer"", pero van a tener menos problemas que usando el cable (aun esta en beta), aparte de que van a poder seguir jugando wireless. Otro punto importante es que si hacen eso, van a poder comprar juegos de Steam, que son mas baratos que en la tienda de Oculus.

Hands-down, the future of gaming. You don’t play games with this thing, you engage in experiences. The possibilities are unlimited. Keep in mind, graphically and functionally, this unit isn’t the best in any individual category, but is truly the best overall experience. And the price point is unheard of, compared to buying a next gen console on arrival. This is, what the NES did for home gaming. The tech and our ability to adapt it for VR experiences is still in its infancy. For any of its drawbacks, you keep that in mind. This is the absolute tip of the spear in what will be a revolution in how we play games, but more uniquely, how we will interact with virtual space for the next generation.Do yourself a favour and buy one. Then share it with your friends.Gamers will find it very intuitive, non-gamers will need someone familiar with VR to help them acclimatize to the control aspects.100% wireless.100% enjoyable.

You will find better quality VR gear but this one has no wires or towers - it makes room scale that much more immersive when you don't have to think about a tether. Oculus Quest feels like a VR gaming console mixed with a VR version of your Android smartphone. The dashboard is very fun and snappy to ""shoot at"" with the controllers. It's very immersive.Setup using the phone was quick and easy. I made an Oculus account and skipped linking it to Facebook because I don't use it. It also let me skip the credit card info which is good because I'm not ready to buy anything else just yet. Then the phone put the headset into update mode and it was done minutes later. The Quest came pre-loaded with quite a few demos to try which was nice. None of the games gave me motion sickness, but the joystick movement and buggy looking menu system in Rec Room eventually got to me. I had to take the headset off for a bit to settle the stomach before jumping back in.The only major con I have been experiencing is with the lenses, apparently the smudgey look in them is normal so I have accepted it as a first-gen limitation of the manufacturing process, it's not usually that noticeable but it's annoying when it is. The headset makes you see things as though they are further away so I had to use contact lenses as a near-sighted person. The headset has enough room for my small rectangle glasses as well but big round glasses don't fit. There is definitely a screen door effect but it's also not very noticeable while you are moving around gaming. Being able to watch TV in VR is very cool and useful but the visual experience is degraded because of the lenses and the screen door effect and in no way compares to regular TV quality. Making the VR TV enormous helps though and laying down and watching on the ceiling is crazy.Overall I have had a ton of fun and, despite its flaws, it feels well worth the price for entry VR. I wasn't sure if this would be a keep or a return since VR is still so early but I'm totally hooked now.

I used Windows mixed reality since 2018. However, the experience was ok as my set has no manual IPD thus the experience is not good as the software IPD cant meet the setting I need. Focus is always a challenge. My brother bought the Quest and I was shocked how good the visual was compared to my WMR set. Despite the lower resolution compare to the WMR, the manual IPD adjustment make a night and day difference to my experience. The WMR has reliability issue, I have the headset and controller replaced once during the warranty. I hope the Quest is more reliable. Other than that the Quest is front heavy which I have to use counter weight. The option to use it without wire is also a big plus. I am very impressed with the Quest and am anticipating the Quest 2 which should be even better. (update after 3 months) the right controller suddenly loss the haptic feedback. After taking all the suggested steps of Re-pairing, resetting quest to factory default, the motor still refuse to move. I thought oculus should do better than WMR as this is my 2nd experience of failed controller with VR.

The oculus quest is the best piece of hardware I ha e ever owned. Better than any console, better than my laptop. This thing sucks you into the digital world like you wouldn't believe. The immersion is insane. Screen door effect is almost unnoticable. In terms of detail and screen quality, this far surpasses the HTC vive.

When I visiting my son in May he had the older version with cameras on stands lots of set up and more.  I fell in love with VR, but not the setup. When he let me know they now had the Oculus Quest which was literally just a headset and hand controls that did the same thing, I purchased it immediately. Madly in love with the game called Beat Saber and have played it once or twice a day since buying this unit.  It's amazing. A few glitches occasionally but nothing important. I highly recommend this set.

Hacia tiempo queria adquirir un headset de vr, y la vdd excedio las expectativas, es ligero, registra muy bien el movimiento de los brazos, tiene una libreria de juegos muy amplia ( ahora aun mas desde que estan cn el beta de oculus link para pider jugarlo cn una pc gamer ) vale cada peso que pague por el, el tiempp de juego varia alrededor de las dos horas, lo cual al principio esta bien en lo que acostumbras la vista, despues podria parecer corto sobretodo si compartes el juego cn alguien mas pero se arregla cn un battery pack.

I spent a few months trying to decide whether to purchase the Oculus Rift S or the new Quest.  I was initially worried about the quality of the games, running on a mobile processor vs a full pc desktop with a powerful graphics card, but after watching reviews, and then discovering the possibility of being able to stream VR games from my gaming PC, I decided to bite the bullet and purchase the Quest.  A couple of things immediately won me over:1) No cables and 360 degree tracking.  This, in itself, is amazing and a game changer.  Once you try it, it’s really really hard to go back.2) The portability.  I travel a lot for work and I can take this thing with me anywhere.  That’s awesome.The game library is somewhat limited, but games are coming out all the time and there are quite a few great options in the store.  Beat Saber is fantastic, and there are a number of really fun and immersive games that will blow you away.If I have any complaints they would be the following:1) The unit is somewhat heavy sitting on your face.  It’s not too bad, but long sessions you may notice it.2) Battery life - I get about 2 hours right now, which is actually fine as I usually only play for about 30mins to an 1hr each evening so it’s enough for me, but may be a pain for those who like longer sessions (FYI - you can use a battery pack and mount it on the back for extra play time should you desire, there’s a couple guides on the net that explain how to do this).3) Audio.  It has these built in speakers that fire down towards your ears and, while it works quite well, you’ll probably want to get your one earphones to use instead.  A nice feature is that Oculus provide two external headphone jacks on either side of the headset, and they work great.  But it’s something to note.  Also, if you do use the built in ones, everyone will hear what you are playing.All in all I absolutely love this device and am thrilled with it.  I cannot wait to see where this technology goes, the possibilities are endless and I really believe this is the future of VR.

Awesome! I love the feeling of being put into a game, and it's wireless! I had an HTC Vive (another virtual reality headset) and it hooked up to my computer, and I kept tripping on the cord! With this, I can move around with ease!The only downside is that there aren't as many games as the other headsets but they are working on making that available. I also heard you can hook it up to your pc for better graphics and the other games!

So I have a valve index which I thought would be the best of the best and I'm alot of cases, it is. But this headset is what I feel is the most innovative of all. Having full 6 degrees of freedom with PC quality games in an all-in-one headset is just astonishing. I was actually very skeptical of the inside out tracking but a buddy got this headset and the first time I tried it I knew this was a special product. Honestly people if you have never experienced vr before or have but want something to bring with and think this might just be a cheap rip off of vr, it's not.  The battery life does only last for just over 2 hours for me if Im playing a intensive game like super hot or espire 1 but with the included cable that can reach quite a distance, I was never far enough away from a receptacle that I had to worry about that. The resolution and oled screens made reading text super easy and made browsing and watching videos a pleasant experience. Big screen which is a movie theater simulated experience was awesome because you just lay in bed while being a movie theater. The tracking is near perfect. I never had an issue with aiming guns or interacting with stuff, it just works Everytime. The recently implemented hand tracking is pretty neat but it's only useful for menu navigation for now.  So coming from having a really good PC vr system, I'd say this experience is on par with that of the valve index due to not having to have a wire attached to you so you're free to go wherever you want and have true vr that's portable. With oclulus link now available, you can even use it as a pc vr headset if you have that or for later down the road too!! There's almost no reason to not pick this bad boy up as it'll be the center piece of parties or gatherings or just to have at breaks at work to get everyone to try out the wonderfulness that is virtual reality!

First of all, a lot of people complain about the headset being front heavy. Yes, it’s a little bit heavier than some other VR systems, but in no way does this limit gameplay. It also doesn’t hurt your face like some reviews would make you believe, you just need to get the straps right and you’ll be good.I previously owned the PSVR, and the Quest is definitely better. Having no wires makes games twice as immersive. As far as graphics go, the Quest isn’t the best on the market but you will not find anything this good for the price. After owning both types of systems I would recommended spending the extra 100 dollars for the Quest.The system is relatively new, so the store doesn’t have a huge selection. That being said they’re are plenty of great titles on it (Beat Saber, Pistol Whip, Superhot), there are games being added almost daily.All in all, great system. May not be perfect, but in this price range it is 100% your best option.

Since amazon is now blocking me from reviewing the Quest 2, consider this a review of both Quest 1 and 2.  I was very happy with the Quest 1 for the past year and thought I'd upgrade to the Quest 2.  I've had the Quest 2 for 5 days now and cannot use it due to the horrible decision Oculus has made to FORCE A FACEBOOK account to use the device otherwise its just a paperweight.  My newly created facebook account has been disabled and I cannot even get started with it.  Oculus support can do nothing about it.  They cannot support what they require.  They tell me to contact facebook.  Facebook does nothing to resolve the issue.  Keep in mind this can happen to you at any time and you can lose everything you've purchased.  I'll be returning mine and never buying an Oculus product again

The moment that the controllers reach <50% battery energy / device <30%, the controllers start desyncing and disappearing. The device sometimes doesn't remember set up guardians.

Lo malo:Hay un hueco te tamaño considerable debajo del headset una vez que te lo pones, por lo que podrían causarse problemas en cuanto a la inmersión al VR se refiere, se puede corregir ingeniándoselas para cubrir el hueco, pero no debería ser así, el headset es pesado en comparación con otros del mercado, obligatoriamente tienes que usar el celular para configurarlo por primera vez y se actualizará sin siquiera consultarlo, la tienda de Oculus Quest no dispone de muchas aplicaciones y juegos que Steam VR si tiene debido al procesador y memoria del headset, por lo que sera necesario conectar el headset a una computadora gamer para poder utilizar Steam VR y otras apps de VR, los tutoriales y configuraciones pueden llegar a ser monotonas, la creacion de avatares es muy basica y no hay mucha variedad para crear un personaje, oficialmente no hay forma de utilizar Steam VR de manera inalámbrica ya que Oculus bloqueó esta opcion de una App de terceros, se desconoce si en un futuro se implementará dicha funcionalidad de manera oficial, la aberración cromática está presente en el headset de manera leve y hay que tener especial cuidado de donde se guarda despues de ser utilizado pues es bastante delicado al polvo, humedad y luz solar.Lo bueno:Headset completamente independiente una vez configurado desde el teléfono, libertad completa de exploración y desplazamiento al no contar con cables obligatorios, buen tracking de los controles y la funcionalidad de hand tracking para usar tus manos en lugar de los controles es sorprendente, cuenta con bocinas y microfono integrado de alta calidad lo que facilita la inmersión en VR de una manera fantástica, la funcionalidad de Oculus Link permite que el headset sea reconocido por medio de cable como un Oculus Rift y así poder jugar a cualquier aplicación o juego existente en tu PC, la conectividad del headset es muy buena y es muy personalizable a nivel software, buena calidad en materiales tanto del headset como de los controladores.

I have previously owned a Gear VR, Oculus Dk2 and CV1. I have also used a Vive. This has blown them all away.Touch controllers are in my opinion the best improvement to VR since the launch of the big consumer devices. The combination of these with a wireless complete mobile setup is revolutionary. I find myself playing this way more than I ever did with any other VR device.I got rid of my Oculus CV1 when I had a child because I didn’t have time to deal with a gaming pc, updates, cord + sensor management, etc. This has made VR gaming open for casuals.Be aware since the device only came out in May, at the time of this writing the top end game Library is small, but really all you need is beat Saber and Vader Immortal to keep you entertained for months.PS.

Hardware/Equipo: estéticamente es un buen producto, los materiales se perciben de buena calidad aunque algunos no son los correctos para su función, la banda de audio no esta bien ensamblada y la almohadilla absorbe el sudor, los trigers de los controles se sienten un poco frágiles y la resolución de pantalla no es lo mejor, duración de batería corta 2 hrs aprox.Software/Sistema: tiene algunos fallos frecuentes, a veces se congela, o no reconoce los controles, o falla el sistema de seguridad perimetral (guardian), a mi parecer se siente aún en desarrollo ( se han liberado actualizaciones).Catalogó de Juegos: aún limitado, han estado saliéndo nuevos (principalmente shooters), los juegos de rol son muy cortos, recomiendo descargar los que cuenten con juego en línea, los precios van de los $9 a los $34 USD la mayoría entre $19 y $30.Comodidad: de inicio es difícil lograr un buen enfoque, si lo ajustas demasiado puede doler la cabeza, algunos juegos te van a provocar nausea, te acostumbras  con el paso de los días, algunos juegos te harán sudar, en zonas cálidas mejor que cuentes con aire acondicionado como en mi caso mty.Resumen: Después de 6 semanas de uso no me arrepiento de la compra, algunos juegos son muy inmersivos y realistas, incluso algunos para ejercitarse, los gráficos no son muy pulidos pero aun así la experiencia es buena, además de juegos hay apps y canales para ver contenidos en VR, como sitios icónicos de ciudades del mundo o recorridos por las montañas, y algunas apps para conectar lap top y usar el visor para tener oficina virtual con monitores múltiples, buena opción si tienes buen espacio en casa ya que no es para uso exterior.

La tienda ahora 2019 es algo limitada y tiene pocas ofertas, los precios sobre 10 y 30 usd, pero son buenos y divertidos.Con Oculus Link ya podrás jugar juegos de Rift y de PC.Puntos en contra es que a veces se siente algo pesado después de un tiempo, y hay que apretarlo mucho. Y la pila le dura unas 2hrs y media de juego continuas.

Muy buena compra no me arrepiento, se que puede ser algo caro pero si quieres meterte a los juegos de realidad virtual esta Occulus ayuda mucho por ser independiente de la computadora. Unico malo es que pesa mucho y puede llegar a ser algo molesto jugar por mucho tiempo, pero es algo que con accesorios se arregla.

Not having a PC powerful enough to get into VR I thought I'd never be able to try it. But this VR headset being complete standalone changed everything. Some cons with this device is the low battery life and being extremely front heavy. You would not be comfortable wearing this for more than an hour without balancing it out with something on the back. Luckily there are solutions to this like adding a head-strap or attaching a power bank to the back to extend battery life and reduce the front pressure.

Purchased for the family and the kids love it. Lucked out and received the 3 Vader Immortals for free which was the icing on top. Games are reasonably priced and the kids are addicted to Superhot VR. Easy to set up and Oculus link makes it even better if you decide you want to get better quality and more games by hooking up to a PC. Side loading is also pretty easy to do and adds some extra options.

The Oculus Quest is a great headset, and the freedom you get with it is reason enough to buy it alone!Oculus Link proved to me that PC VR is tedious and annoying. It's much nicer to just pop on the headset, click a game, and get going, without dealing with USB issues or game launch issues or SteamVR issues.One thing I'd like to see improved however is casting. It'd be nice if we were able to cast to PC for doing Twitch streams etc.

初めてのVRで期待してたのですが、右コントローラーの初期不良で返品になりました。結構待たされたのに、再注文でまた一カ月待たされるはめに、、ゲームとかケースやら色々購入しているので購入しないわけにいかないし、、追記2月4日Amazonからのメールにて、返品された商品の本体と箱のシリアルナンバーが違うので返金手続きできませんとの事、、更に破棄をしますって。何を言ってるんでしょうね？こっちはメーカーとやり取りして故障の可能性があるからAmazonで返品手続きしてって言われたのに。故障した商品を1月31日にAmazonに返送後、2台目を購入し2月3日に商品到着、故障もなく使用。2月4日Amazonからメールが届き本体と箱のシリアルが違うとの事。購入したまま返送したのに。念のため2台目の本体のシリアルと箱を確認！シリアル違うんですけど❗️初めからシリアル違うジャン。もし2台目も初期不良だったら返金してくれないの？シリアル違うよ？wこれ詐欺でしょ？サポートには連絡済み後日連絡との事

PSVR発売日からVRを始め、買った時にはあんなに楽しかったPSVRもホコリを被っていました。面倒くさい。まずケーブルを用意し…水平な所に置いて電源入れて少し待って…やっと被るけど前後調整とダイヤル回して…モーションコントローラーどこに置いたかわからないから半分外して探して…やっと開始。とにかくPSVRは内容どうこうより準備が面倒くさい。ケーブルも旧型なのでやたら太いわ邪魔くさいわ…oculus questを買ってそのめんどさがほぼ解消されました！邪魔臭いケーブルもない！被るのも1回合わせればもう2度目からは調整いらない！5秒で開始！トラッキングも普通にPSVRより良いから変な水平合わせもいらん！なにより被ってても周り見えるモードがあるからいちいちVR外さなくてもコントローラー見える！探せる！目の間隔調整も本体のつまみ動かせば終わり！もうこれだけでどれだけ敷居が下がるかお分かりになると思います。画質ですがpsvrの初期ゲーム(サマレとかkitchenとか)より全然画質いいです。流石にPCVRよかは下がるでしょうけど。ぜーんぜん、なーんだ綺麗じゃん！て感じです。それにPCと接続してsteamVRできる方法もあるみたいですし完成度高すぎてびっくりですおススメします。是非

I was constantly waiting for a jumping on point for VR and this is exactly that. It gives a fully immersive VR experience despite any graphical sacrifices due to the 6DOF and Hand Presence. those two factors are WAY more important than graphics for immersion. 64GB is also way more than necessary right now. The only gripes I have are that there's no cloud saving yet and there are tiny spots of static that pop up randomly but they're jut annoyances at most.

ゲーム機としての評価は星5点満点中2点体験としては星5点満点中10点以下、実際使ったり調べたりして分かった事・Rift Sの方がパネル解像度が高い(つまり画質が良い)・Rift Sの方がリフレッシュレートも高い(72Hzと80Hz)・Oculus Linkでの接続は多少色情報が失われる　(気になる程ではないし、アップデートで改善される可能性はある)・市販のUSB3ケーブルより、Rift Sのケーブルの方が柔らかく取り回しし易い・ヘッドバンドの調整のし易さもダイヤル式のRift Sに分がある・Rift Sの方が軽い・Oculus Linkがまだベータ版なので安定性に欠ける・イヤホンジャックにホワイトノイズが割とある(これはRift Sも)・2020年1月現在、BluetoothはSBCのみなので遅延が結構ある自分は今のところ99.9%Oculus Linkでの使用なので、Rift Sのが良かったかも？とちょっと後悔しています。2/12追記アップデートがありOculus Linkが繋がらなくなりました。スタンドアロンで楽しむ方法が私にはありません。2時間程格闘しましたが諦めました。しばらくしてアップデートがきて繋がるようになりました。8/1追記Virtual DesktopというOcullusアプリを使用して、無線でSteamVRを遊べるという事なので導入してみました。結果、遅延や画質の低下等も体感ではほとんど感じられず、快適に使用できています。Questの価値が自分の中でぐぐっと上がりました。wifiの5Ghz環境とアプリ代1990円、そして導入に一手間かかりますが、興味がある方はググってみてください。(ちなみにアプリはSteam版やPCのOculusアプリから買える物は別物ですので間違えない様に注意・経験者)

製品自体はとても良いです。ハンドトラッキング機能の追加にも期待しています(今はテスト機能として使える)。ただ、コントローラー用の付属電池が液漏れします。(知り合いのものも変形・液漏れしていたため、""そういう電池""を付属しているのだと思います)製品自体はとても良いので、注意喚起のために星１としました。みなさま気を付けてください。追記(2020/03/04)初期不良で返品したところ、""本体に汚れがあるため""という曖昧な理由により、返金拒否。他の方のレビューにもありますが、どうやら初期不良の場合でもAmazonは返金をしてくれないようです。この件はAmazonに問い合わせ中です。

嫁に逢いたい.....その思いで、当初は Lift s を購入予定でしたが、どうやら、クエストでも出来るようなので、こちらを購入しました。結論から言えば....感動で、涙が出てきました人生初の、VRということも相まって、セットアップから感動しっぱなし。（ちなみに、セットアップ時に本体の映像がダウンロードが５０％から進まない、という方はスマフォの動画を視聴すると進みます。私はそこでバカみたいに再起動を繰り返してました....）　設定にはUSB接続する為、クエストはUSB-Cなので、変換コネクタを購入しました解説サイトを見れば、簡単にセットアップは完了します。（virtual desktopの購入費用は必要。VプリカもPaypalを通す事で利用可能）　当初はクエストの接続回線が遅く、カックカクになってしまい、興醒めでしたなので、新規に５千円ほどのルーターを購入し、２～３メーターほどの距離に置き再プレイ最高です....ぬるぬる踊ってます....神様ありがとう... 私は眼鏡人なので、視力 0.06と0.07の両目で0.08、-5.0のリーフツアラーを購入しました違いがすごいあると思いきや...別に眼鏡を付けていても、装着時と脱着時は本体の位置を多少調整しますが、なれてしまうと、逆にリーフツアラーが邪魔に感じて、結局つけてません。クエストの装着感も眼鏡をつけていても、「眼鏡邪魔っ！」って思ったのは始めてクエストを装着した時ぐらいで、なれてしまうと、なんとも思いません。（私の眼鏡の形状もあると思うので、画像を参照してください。）私のように、嫁に逢いたくてリフトSを購入しようとしていて、回線の問題を解決できそうならば、間違いなく、クエストで正解でしょう。それと、イヤホンジャックは２つありますが、一つにさせばちゃんと両耳から聞こえますので、片耳を２つ購入する必要はありません。ただ、サー...というノイズ音があります。

Rift SとQuestで長い間悩みに悩んだ結果Questを購入しました決め手は・11月実装予定のOculusLink(今まで非公式のみだったPCVR化を公式がサポートする)の発表・OculusQuestでのみ「ハンドトラッキング」の実装を発表・↑上記のことからもわかる通りRift Sの扱いがかなり酷い点(Rift Sの発表は何も無し)・ビートセイバーのカスタム曲プレイが非公式でサポート再開でした使ってみた感想ですが、GalaxyGearVR(スマホ用VRゴーグル)は持っていたのですがあんなものとはクオリティが100億倍くらい違うことにまず驚きました画質、できることの多さ、サポートの充実ぶりからして何もかも私の想定外でしたね心配していたトラッキング性能も、これより上が存在することが信じられないと思うほどにかなり高性能で大変満足でした言ってしまえばもうOculusQuestのチュートリアルをしてるだけで楽しいですやはりPCVRではないのでケーブルレスということもあり没入感がとんでもないことになってますまるで某ラノベ作品のVRMMOを彷彿とさせるレベルでしたコントローラーを握ってるだけなのにいつもの感覚で物を掴んだり指を指したりできるのは圧巻でした目当てのビートセイバーのチュートリアルもやってみましたがこちらも大満足毎日運動を欠かせない私でもデモプレイだけで汗だくになってしまい、かなり期待できそうです※ちなみに私は横幅広めの眼鏡を使用しているのですが、Quest単体だと何の問題もなく装着できましたただし、Questは他でも言われている通り日本人に合わせて作られてはいないので、鼻の辺りに隙間が空いてこれ単体だけだと光が差し込んでしまいますなのでカバーを買うのがとてもおすすめなんですが、このカバーをつけてしまうと私のような広めの眼鏡は若干はめ込むような付け心地になってしまう点だけ要注意です私はそこまで神経質ではないので気になりませんが一応参考までに

dmm公開されたと聞いて購入しました。結果、一定の距離ならスマホvrとか比べても大差はないが、近距離だとぼける。近すぎる感を調整できないのが致命的。2020年8月、少しは改善されたが調整はきかない。3D OFF機能が追加されたのはいいが位置がずれるから何もかも中途半端。メニュー画面を出した時に切り替わる2D画面ぐらいの距離感、くっきり感ができれば文句なし。オキュラスでdmmみるメリットて操作のしやすさぐらいしかない！他はスマホVRに全部劣る。この程度か…アプデ修正くることを少し期待してる。音量マックスでも没入感に欠ける。基本的に音が小さい。イヤホンをしてもちょっとよく聞こえる程でヘッドフォン並とはまだはいかない。ただVRゲームは素晴らしいね。GOじゃなくてクエストでよかったよ！ゲームは楽しませてもらってるからまだいいかな。NetflixもYouTubeとか2D見るのはいいね。まあ長時間は頬が痛くなるし、疲れるから結局モニタでみることになるだろう。まあ体験すべき世界ではあったから買って悔いはない。今後に期待。

ハードウェアとしてはコードレスで使いやすくて良いと思いますが、まともなソフトがないのが致命的です。そもそもソフトの本数が少ないのと、無料のスマホゲームに毛が生えたような安っぽいミニゲームみたいなものばかりなので、ゲーム目的なら正直おすすめできません。しかも日本語のゲームは殆どないです。また、oculus go など別のハードウェアのソフトは使えないため買い直しになります。　今後新しいハードウェアを買っても買い直しになる可能性が高いので注意が必要です。ただ目的を変えると別です。ゲームとしてはダメですがフィットネス器具としてなら良いと思います。リズムゲームのビートセイバーは全身を使うため体には良いです。また、アダルト視聴目的なら良いとは思います。

公式サイトより、使い慣れたアマゾンでと思い、5/1争奪戦に打ち勝って、定価で買えましたが、AMAZONからの配達が6/8（約３週遅れ）になった負け組みです。公式サイトで5/1に予約した人は遅くとも5/25位には入手出来ていた様なので、在庫が潤沢になるまで、公式サイトから直接買った方が、確実に定価で、割と早く手に入れられるようです。64GB版は公式サイト6/9注文で6/20前後出荷。128GB版は6/12前後出荷らしいですし、ADPより、トラッキングが確実な配送がされると思うので（OCULUS GO買ったときはFedex->郵便だった。)海外通販の入門に是非。公式サイトのログイン部分は、Facebookアカウントが必要なように見えるけど、Facebookアカウントボタンの脇にこっそり有るOCULUSアカウントを作っても買えるので、FaceBookアカウント作りたくないなーと言う人も安心。ワイアー無しのVRは没入感がすげぇ。案外、チュートリアルのfirststepが遊べる。STAR WARS のは日本語の字幕もないので、ちょい厳しい・・・BEAT SAVER は バンドルにすべき！というか最初に買うのはこれが一番かも・・・製品としては星５個！

Oculus Goを持っているのですが、6DoF目的で購入しました。チュートリアルを始めて真っ先に感じたのは、画面がクリアな事。Goでは暗所が白みがかって少々ささくれた画質という印象だったのが、Questでは有機ELのおかげか黒が締まり艶のある画面になりました。更に、黒が締まったことにより網目感も低減しているようです。フレネルレンズ特有の滲みはどうしても発生するのですが、そちらもあまり気になりませんでした。スピーカーも割と良い音が出ています。チュートリアルがさりげなく立体音響になっていて感心しました。6DoFも全く不満なく、全体的に高レベルに仕上がっていると思います。空間にお絵描きできるアプリで、トニースターク気分に浸っていたら2 時間くらい経っていました…。あとはコンテンツが拡充すれば。

今まで体験したVRと言えばスマホを2000円程度のゴーグルに挿し込んで楽しむタイプの物しか遊んでおらず、本物のVRがどういう物かずっと気になってました。今までのVR HMDと言えばパソコンが必要だったりPlayStationが必要だったり、トラッキングのためのカメラを部屋に設置しなければならなかったり、僕にとっては敷居が高すぎて手が出せないでいました。しかしある動画でOculus questが紹介されていてそれを見たら「電源ケーブル以外のケーブル不要」「パソコンもPlayStation等のハードも不要」「トラッキングも外部からではなく本体にカメラ内蔵」と画期的な内容を聞かされた次の瞬間にはAmazonを開いてポチってましたwゲームのボリューム的にはまだまだどれも短めですが、それでもVR世界への没入感から得られる体験は他のゲーム機とは比較にならないほど斬新で衝撃的です。パソコンPS等の3Dゲームと言えど、所詮は平面でポリゴンを使用し遠近法で立体感、奥行きがあるように見せているだけですからね。それと実際に物体がそこにある感覚を体験できるVRとは文字通り180度別物です。なぜなら180度振り返ってもそこに何かが存在してるという。ホラーゲームの怖さは4倍です、PC・PSだと自身は前（画面）だけ見てコントローラーで画面上で後ろも確認できますが所詮自分は前を見てるだけ、それに比べVRでは自分がゲーム内のキャラに扮する訳なので左右も後ろも実際に頭を振り返って気にしなければならず背筋は常にゾワゾワと凍ったまま、めちゃめちゃ怖いですw買ってよかった、今体験できて本当に良かったです。2作目も絶対に買います。

チュートリアルのゲームが無料で遊べるが、まずそれだけでも心を鷲掴みされます。ゲームのほかにも、youtubeの360℃映像で宇宙や自然や動物を見たり、netflixなどのアプリを見たり。まだ本数が少ないですがbigscreenというアプリで3Dの映画をチケットを購入して観たり。ウェブブラウザも使えるので、WebVR・WebXRなど無料公開されているゲームをオンラインで遊べたりもします。ただ、レンズを通してみる実際の映像は綺麗ではありません。それこそブラウン管テレビ並みです。紹介サイトやyoutubeなどで上げられている映像とは全く異なり、画質はめっっさ荒いです。失望します。また焦点や装置自体を自分に合わせるのが難しく、じわじわくる重さがあるので最初馴れるまで苦労します。こういったマイナス面を加味しても、総じてこれは素晴らしい買い物だったと満足しています。

最近のコロナ流行の影響で身体を動かす機会を失っておりましたところ、VRで気楽に運動ができるとニュースで特集が組まれておりました。子供や大人がすごく楽しそうに運動している姿を観て非常に興味が沸き怪訝としているところはありましたが手ゴロナ値段もあり即購入。一ヶ月待ちようやく手元に届き、いざプレイ。使用感は下記の通り。・装着感よし、某ゲーム会社のゴーグルのようにこめかみが痛くなることがない。・重さよし、同上。・大きさよし、同上。・視界よし、ピント合わせも簡単にできる。・コントローラーの反応速度よし、遅延があまりない。思っていた通りに動く。・別途ケーブル、PCを買えばSteamVR等も体感可能。おすすめソフトはBOXVR。・別途カメラ不要。内蔵カメラがあるからプレイエリアを簡単に変更可能。最後に難点を言えば、Oculus専用のゲームが日本向けのものが少なく手を出しづらいですね。この為、日本で評価のあるSteamVRのソフトを購入しケーブルをPCに繋げプレイするのがベストだと思いました。余談ですが私的にこういう体験ができたらいいなーってのがあります。VR空間上で寝ながらゲームをしたりハンズフリーで読書を楽しめるそんな癒し空間体験できる日を待っています。

Quest本体の性能に不満はとくにありません。OculusLinkについて書きます。OculusLink接続時「ヘッドセットの音声がありません」というメッセージが出て、Quest本体からはゲームの音声が再生されませんでした。再生デバイスを「Oculus Virtual Audio Device」からそれ以外(=普段使っているデバイス)に変更したところ、Questから音が出るようになりました。ただし「ヘッドセットの音声がありません」というメッセージは消えず、PCに接続しているスピーカーからも同時に音が出てしまいます。(2020/1/4時点)これ以外には問題はなさそうです。私の環境ではOculusLinkを介しRift対応ゲームをプレイできています。SteamVRも動作しました。Win10 proi7-8700RAM 32GBGTX1050TiMB ASUS ROG STRIX Z390-F GAMINGOculusアプリバージョン12.0.0.306.268QUESTのバージョン12.0.0.226.以下略OculusLinkの動作条件には「USB 3.0 ports」とあります。Z390-Fでは、USB3.1Gen2ポート(Type-A)にて接続できました。Gen1ポートでは接続が確立しませんでした。使用したUSBケーブルは「SHEAWA Oculus Link USB Type-Cケーブル Oculus Quest USB3.1 10Gbps 3M SteamVR対応 USB-A to USB Type-C」というものです。C to C ケーブルは所有していないので、USB3.1gen2 Type-Cポートは試せておりません。OculusLinkが上手く動作しない場合には、USBケーブルの品質と長さ、USBホストコントローラとの相性、USBポートの転送能力または給電能力、USB変換アダプターやハブが介在するかどうか、Oculusアプリのバージョン、Questのファームウェアバージョン、OculusLinkのGPUサポート状況、グラフィックボードの性能とドライバ、などいろいろ確認すべきことが多そうです。

注文から１か月で待ちに待ったOculus Questが届きましたので、早速セットアップを行いましたが、初心者の方は躓きそうな手順がいくつかありましたので補足します。ここでは、スマホからのセットアップ手順を説明しますので、ぜひ参考にしてください。１．まず、箱から付属品を全て出したら、真っ先に本体の充電をしてください。　　・ここで、たいていの方は電源インジケータがオレンジ色になっていると思いますので、まずは満充電　　　させてください。満充電になるとインジケータは緑色になります。　　・充電中に電源ボタンを長押ししても電源オンしません。私はここで電源がオンしない！と慌てて　　　しまいました。２．本体の充電を待っている間、コントローラに付属の単三電池をセットしてください。　　・コントローラの電池カバーはマグネット式ですので、力を入れる必要がなくカバーの着脱が可能です。３．次に、スマートフォンにOculusアプリをインストールしてください。　　・App Store または Play store からダウンロードできます。４．Oculusで遊ぶためには、OculusアカウントかFacebookアカウントが必要になりますが、　　・どちらもない場合は、Facebookアカウントを事前にスマホで作成しておくことをお勧めします。５．本体の充電が完了したら、いよいよセットアップ開始ですが、その前にスマートフォンが　　WiFiオン（通常は自宅WiFiに接続）になっていることを確認してください。　　・ここでモバイル回線接続状態だとセットアップできませんので注意してください。６．Oculusアプリを起動したら、基本的にOculusアプリの画面の指示に従ってセットアップを進めます。　　・ヘッドセット本体のコード入力では、実際にヘッドセットを頭に装着してレンズを覗いて　　　表示されているコードを確認してください。　　・セットアップの途中で、支払方法の設定が出てきますが、後からでも設定画面で行えますので　　　セットアップ時点ではスキップした方が良いです。　　　私はここで設定したところ処理中状態のままフリーズしてしまい、ヘッドセット本体の　　　アップデートがいつまでも終わらなくハマりました。７．以上でOculusのセットアップが完了したと思います。後はチュートリアルが始まりますので　　コントローラでの操作方法などを体験してください。とにかくこれは素晴らしい！！今まで人並程度にはゲームで遊んできたつもりですが、正に別次元と言っても決して大げさではありません。なによりも没入感が半端なく、事前の予想を余裕で越えた体験を味わえます。コロナ禍の状況もあり、なかなかアクティブに旅行や外食など行くことができないと思いますので、少々値は張りますが、思い切って購入してみてはどうでしょうか。今までの味わったことのないゲーム体験を是非体験してみてください‼

When Alexa notified me that my package arrived containing the long-awaited Oculus Quest, it was like waking up on Christmas morning.  I could hardly stand the obligatory setup process.  (NOTE: Be sure to update your Oculus app on your phone before the package arrives, to avoid another 5 minutes of impatience.)  With the app updated the new hardware was available to add to my list of Oculus Go's.  (I'm fortunate enough that VR is part of my job.)Ah!  The bright and beautiful screen!  I have always been impressed with the bright, sharp Oculus Go screens, and this one was every bit as beautiful.  I'm also thankful to report that YouTube is available on this device.  What a pain it has been on the Rift to watch a simple YouTube video, but I digress.Then I loaded and launched Rec Room.  Ugh.  I'm not sure yet whether the Rec Room porting is a fail, or the Oculus Quest is just not capable enough, but in the end, the experience was much less than stellar.  New gamers might not notice and just accept the lag, but so far, if you're a VR gamer, then you might want to wait this out.  I'm usually a top player in Rec Room paintball, but my senses are honed to detect movement, and peripheral movement detection was all but absent.  Normally, I'm just a split second ahead of my opponent on Rec Room, but alas, the lag between action and result was poor.  Just like with James Holzhauer, if you're not quick on the trigger: you lose.The weight of the device didn't seem like that big of a deal, but even after 20 minutes (before the initial charge wore off and it was alerting me that the battery was dying), the material between the mask and my forehead was already starting to irritate my skin and leave a red mark.  Like picking up the guitar again after a long hiatus, I might grow some callouses and get used to it.There seemed to be a small ""sweet spot"" for visual clarity, and when you find it, the image looks great!  But in gaming, as you move your head quickly from side to side, the inertia moves the visual center.  This can be overcome by tightening the straps, but raises the discomfort mentioned above.Overall, I'm pleased with the device.  It's just not as capable in the area of gaming as I was hoping.  In that regard, I should have gone with the Rift S.  I'd buy one, but my allowance is spent for the time being.Pros:• Bright, sharp screen• Non-tethered (duh!)• My wife or a guest can finally join me in VR!Cons:• Battery life• Lag when gaming• Resolution when gaming• Uncomfortable and weightyI hope this helps in your deliberations on which headset to buy.  Don't take my review as overly critical.  I just want gamers to be informed that this is not the system.  For non-gamers, this will definitely open up a wondrous world of discovery, allowing people to travel places and experience things they would otherwise never see.UPDATE - 05/29/2019:It would seem that the lag on Rec Room has improved, but with the lack of detail in the display and responsiveness of the controls, I regretfully stand by the three-star review.  Please keep in mind that my review is based upon comparisons with the computer-connected Oculus Rift.  If you are buying this without having a computer-connected reference point, or your goal is explicitly for the wireless, no-computer-required, VR experience, then I would expect your experience to rival mine.  Everyone to whom I have shown this device is delighted with the experience and I am quite certain you will enjoy it too!  For me, just for the ability to open up my home computer-tethered VR experience to many who are new to VR has been well worth the investment.<b>Still, I yearned for an Oculus-Rift-like gaming experience - unplugged - and the Quest isn't horrible at it, but it isn't excellent either. Hence, the three-star review.</b>  For non-gaming, the visual experience is a marked improvement, and the ability to roam free, as it were, is awesome!  I do wish they had used a softer material in the facepiece.  Even though the battery life isn't phenomenal, my face wears out quicker than the battery does.  I'm pleased with my purchase; I'm just not ecstatic about it.

5万円はちょっと高いなと思っていましたが、購入してよかったと感じています。スマホVRブームが去り、世の中的にはVRってこんなものか。。となっているようですが、最近追加されたハンドトラッキング機能も含め「物を触れる」「平面状に動ける」など、技術の進歩に驚きがあります。2020年正月現在では低価格で6DoFを実現できるスタンドアロンHMDの決定版と言えます。OculusシリーズでいうところのGoやRiftをカバーできる他、PC-VRのように高スペックPCが必要ない点も魅力的です。ただし機能的にはGoを内含しているものの、アプリの数自体はGoの方が現状でも多く、こちらは選択肢が限られる点は知って置く必要があります。・よかった点- 無料でもそこそこ楽しいアプリが多い　→最初のチュートリアルで物を掴む、移動するチュートリアルがある。すごいってなる。- 前後移動ができるため、没入感が向上するのがわかる　→ガーディアンと呼ばれる、部屋の中を移動できる範囲をHMDがトラッキングしているため安全なVR体験ができる- 普通のyoutubeやネットフリックスなども見れる　→ながら見しちゃうと展開がわからなくなることがありますが、完全に視界を取られているのでそういった心配はない（逆にいうとながら見したい。。。VRストリーミング+ツイート実況みたいな世界はまだ）- アプデで座ったままでも使えるようになった　→部屋の動ける範囲を広く決めなければならないわけではなく、自分の頭の届く範囲を設定してその中でVRを楽しめる3DoF+モードがあります。これにより対応したアプリを座ったまま楽しむことができます。・よくなかった点-Goのアプリを起動できるわけではない（ストアが完全に別、やりたいアプリがQuest側にないことも　※Goを持っていれば非公式だがアプリのインストールファイルをぶっこ抜くという方法もあるが。。。-キラータイトルが少ない　Beat SeaverやNational Geographic、youtube、DMMなどはあるもののまだまだ6DoFに対応した体験ができるアプリは多くない印象。ストアの審査基準を厳しくすることをOculus側も明言しているので、非公式アプリを楽しめるようなスキルがあった方が楽しみの幅が広がりそうな予感がする。- 思ったほど画質はよくない(液晶のドットが見える)

初めてのVRゴーグルとなります。単体で動画視聴、Oculus LinkでPCのVRゲームを楽しんでいます。通常のディスプレイと比べると解像度は落ちますし、フレームレートによるものなのか3D酔いもします。しかし没入感は評判通り素晴らしく性能が格段に上がるだろう次世代VRゴーグルにはとても期待しています。あと、ゴーグルが意外に重くて頬に荷重が掛かるのですが、ヘッドバンドの後ろに錘を付けると前後のバランスが取れて頬への負担が軽減されます。お試しあれ。（私は100均で売っていたトレーニング用の腕に巻く砂錘りを使いました）

顔に当たる部分がスポンジの様な素材で汗が染みこむので、汚れ・匂い対策に何かしらのフェイスカバー必須重量が全面に集中しているせいで、そのまま装着すると頬の辺りが痛い締め付け感があるとか重いとかじゃなく、痛い。なので痛み軽減の為に重り自作必須「oculusquest カウンターウェイト」等で検索マジックテープで重りをくくり付けるだけで劇的に改善されます(それでも違和感ゼロは多分無理)ケーブルが気にならなければモバイルバッテリー無しでも充電コード繋げたままプレイも可能ですが元々の稼働時間が2時間と短いのもあって、重りにはよくモバイルバッテリーがお勧めされてます個人差が有るので、購入前に家にあるものでサイズや重さを試し、それに似た重量の物を用意しましょうコントローラーのトラッキングが甘く、たまに手がすっ飛んで行く日光や部屋の明るさに影響を受けるらしいので、カーテン閉めた上で電気付けてやってます

大人になってゲームも飽きてきたなぁと思ってた時にPSVRを買ってVRに感動して、ついでにOculus も買ってしまいました。結果、大満足です！　　満足点…コードもなく単体で動く。没入感が半端ない。ゲームの値段も適切。PSVRは起動が大変。YouTube見てるだけでも大画面で映画館のように見れる。不満点…鼻の部分が日本人とマッチしないのか、そこだけ下の景色が見えてしまう。コントローラー電池が切れやすい。グリッドライン作るのが面倒くさい。日本ゲームメーカーがのソフト参入が少なくビッグタイトルが少ない。ただ、総評として大満足です。おそらくバージョンアップしたものもドンドン出てくるでしょうが、この値段ならこの時点で買っても損はないと思います。

長年VRに憧れていましたが、機会が無く体験すらまともにできませんでした。でも低価格で6DoFのコードレスVRが発売されてる事を知り、高評価だったのでためらいなく買いました。立体的に見えるバーチャルリアリティの世界は想像以上に感動しました。肝心の画質はものすごくクリアではありませんが、一般的なVRの中では良いのかな？（網戸越しに景色を見ている感じに似てます）でも立体的に見える世界が広がっていると画質は気にならなくなりますよ。それとスピーカー内蔵なのに耳元でクリアに聞こえるのは不思議でした。他の方も書かれていましたが、装着してるとやっぱり重いですね…

本当か？と言いたくなるほど絶賛レビューが多いoculus questに対するレビューです。色々書きましたが、最後に書いたことが全てだと思います。PCVR環境がないので単体での評価です。そもそもPCがあるならriftsや別機種で良いと思います。●良いところ・パッケージ、本体の作りが良い無駄にしっかりとした箱に本体のデザインも一部メッシュだったりと高級感があります。・値段の割にハードが良い少し前のスマホcpuに液晶2枚とコントローラーとガワと色々で5万は凄い。VR体験ならquest！と言われる所以だと思います。視野角も悪くありません。●悪いところ・性能は値段相応前にも書いた通り、中身は少し前のスマホレベルの性能です。その為ホームですら画質を落とす羽目になり、3dモデルがギザギザしてます。うまく調整しているアプリもありますが、VRchatは画質が汚すぎて私には無理でした。ハード面でもモニターの網目感が凄いです。一昔前のゲーセンの筐体のモニターやブラウン管TVと言ったらわかりやすいでしょうか。大画面モニターとして使いたい！というのは少々厳しい。現状スクリーンドア問題は超ハイエンドVR機種でしかクリアされてないので文句を言うのはズレてる気がしますが…。音質ではスピーカーの指向性は凄いのですが音は良くはありません。残念ながらイヤホンだとホワイトノイズが結構入ってしまいます。・コンテンツが貧弱公式の光量調節方法がなかったり、目の上下調節が無かったり、3d動画で細かい調整が出来なかったり、最近ようやくブラウザが日本語対応したり、公式ですら弱い。サードパーティ製広告ブロックもないのでブラウザでは視界の1/3以上を広告が占領します！アプリも値段の割にボリュームが無いものがほとんどです。フィットネス系やfps系は気になりにくいですが。有料VRavは意外にも沢山あるので是非購入しましょう！無料割れ動画は画質が悪すぎて見るに耐えません。コンテンツの少なさは今後に期待という記事は沢山ありますが、もう一年経ってしまいました。・熱い重い！他のVR機種と違ってこれはPCの代わりに本体が色々演算してくれてます。つまり本体で発熱するわけですね。重量が結構あるのと合わさって連続使用はクーラー込み30分〜1時間が限界です。充電があまり保たないという欠点はこれのおかげで目立ちません。本体側面と顔接地面がメッシュなので汚れにも気をつける必要があります。●結論ハードは値段相応でソフトは一年経った現状でも足りてません。しかしquestが最安の良コスパVRマシンであるのもまた事実です。よってやりたいタイトルのある方には自信を持ってお勧めできますが、特に無い方にはお勧めできません。私の中でoculus questはゲーム機というよりもavが見れるフィットネスマシーンです。

初代のオキュラスが出たときに購入するかどうか散々悩んで、画像の荒さで「買わない」としていました。その後もコードレスにならないものかとずっと待っていましたが、ついに、という感じです。絵の粗さは許容範囲ですし、何よりコードレスなのがいいですね。バーチャル世界と現実世界がシームレスに繋がる感じ。素晴らしいUXです。操作性などUIもいいですね。ただ、コンテンツが少々不満です。スターウォーズは圧巻の完成度とリアリティですが、それ以外のソフトは小粒でオキュラスのハードの圧倒的な完成度を活かせていません。コンテンツにはこれから期待というところでしょうか。

スマホのVRしかこれまでは経験がありませんでしたが、別物ですね。没入感が全く違い、YouTubeの同じ動画でも差がはっきり出ました。Rift Sにするかどうかで迷っていましたが、どうせなら単体でも使用したいと思いQuestを選択。Rift Sを使用したことがないので比較はできませんが、自分は十分満足できるレベルでした。普段から眼鏡を着用しているのでどれほど快適に遊べるか不安がありましたが、問題なく使用できています。眼鏡着用者用にスペーサーが同梱されていますが、個人差はあるかもしれませんが、スペーサーなしでも問題なく使えています。取りあえず自分が購入する際に気になった点だけ書いてみました。

初めて買ったvrです臨場感の強さに驚きました。これほどの感動は人生でそうそう味わえません。ただ他のvrで遊んだことがないのでオキュラスに限った感動ではないと思います。一番の難点は重さです。はじめは楽しくてほとんど気にならなかったのですが冷静になってみるとかなり重いです。重心がおもいきり前なのでずれやすく、それを防ぐためにベルトをきつく締める必要があるので更にほっぺと後頭部が痛くなります(それでもずれる)。同じ重さだとしてもバッテリー等を後ろにして重心を安定させれば全然違うのになーと思います。それから目が悪い人はコンタクト推奨。瞳孔間距離を調整できるので擬似的にピントは合わせられるけれど、限界がある。焦点距離を調整する機能がついたらすごくありがたい。画質もあまり良くない。2の方は良くなってるらしいけど買ってないのでわかりません。画質くらいだったらそのうちもっと良いのが出るでしょう。とにかく重さはどうしようもないので軽量化に期待します。

いままでWindowsMRゴーグルを利用していたが、他のゴーグルが試したくなり購入。セットアップにiOSまたはAndroidが必要なものの、セットアップ完了後は単体で利用できる点が非常に便利。また、PC起動が不要なばかりかケーブルからも解放されたのが非常に大きかった。さらにコントローラの電池は単三１本ずつで、バッテリ状態も把握できるので利用中に切れる前に交換しておける。連続使用しすぎてVR体験中に本体充電切れで突然シャットダウンされたがこれはそれだけ夢中になれたと考えるべきかもしれない。6DoFだけでなく3DoF対応も行われ単純なVR動画視聴などにも使えるようになった、Oculus Goではなくこっちで買っておけば、Oculus Linkを利用してPCゴーグルにもできるなど、とりあえずVRゴーグルはこれを買っておけば一番よさそうという製品になっていると思う。

It is a gorgeous device. Despite knowing the minuses I still love it and would buy again.However, please note that the face sponge would need a daily wash if you are going to be an active user, it absorbs sweat, the sponge dries very slowly. The plastic frame attached to the face sponge is very lightweight and very thin (easily breakable, I broke it 3 days ago while washing). Treat it very gently. The controllers are powered by AAA batteries, they can last a week or so. You would want to keep a pack of extra batteries at home (or buy rechargeable batteries). The helmet itself is quite heavy. Many find that the head strap does not release the pressure well enough. You would probably need to buy one more strap puff to ease the pressure from your face and take some weight to the back of your head. Be careful with the controllers. If you punch something by mistake or if the controllers collide strongly against each other it may cause a crack.The emersion and freedom in VR, freedom to move with no wires is still incredible.  But from the moment you get the helmet there will be more expenses.

IT WAS STILL LOGGED IN TO THE OLD OWNERS OCULUS ACCOUNT!I tested a few games on his account and it works fine, but has white scuff marks from apparently being bashed into a wall. See pics.Im seeking a partial refund because the device is functional and tbh dont want to wait another frickin month, but my unboxing experience of opening a beat up box, with scuff marks and a dead battery was horrendous.And to top it all off, once i charged it and turned it on, it greets me with Hello Daniel!My name is not Daniel. So pheonixgamer235 or whatever (he looked to be about 11, browser was still logged into his instagram) dont worry I factory reset the device myself and didnt spend any of your parents money on games.UPDATE: no response from oculus support, amazon support has a team setup to handle this apparantly, as i was redirected to them specifically. Was offered 10% I do not feel this is enough. The left controller has been spotty and loses tracking occasionally. Other tha  that fully functional, bump it up to 25% and I'll do it but pending more testing I may be fully returning this.

I feel like I waited years for this to come out and I couldn't be more let down. The low resolution literally hurts my eyes. It makes it impossible to do some of the things I was most excited about -- besides play games I couldn't wait to watch Netflix and other shows, but there's no way I could enjoy watching anything on this. Unfortunately I am going to have to return this and wait another couple years for a higher resolution version.

I had a Gen 1 Rift since it was released, upgraded to 3 sensors and the motion controllers but I must say the cable and setup and issue that something blocked my sensors was holding my back. So much so that I actually never used it much despite always being fascinated with VR.Now I have to say that the Quest just arrived, so take my opinion with a pinch of salt as its all still new. But having played a round of table tennis on this device I must say not having to worry about sensors, cables and being able to pick the room with the most space for my VR games is just on another level. After I few minutes I was jumping through my living room and getting an actual sweat in, like I was actually playing table tennis.Yes, the graphics could be improved, FoV refresh rate etc. But once you are in the game being able to freely move around in virtual space with your hands tracked accurately, lets you forget about everything else.As the unit if a fully self-contained gaming console essentially, this for me is the most revolutionary console released since a long time, if not at all.VR was always difficult to explain to another person, but with the Quest you can just bring it to your friends and family and have them experience it. Hence I am convinced this device has a good chance to bring mass adoption to VR gaming.

The Quest could be a good platform, but unfortunately Oculus's draconian anti-consumer business practices make it a bad choice. Oculus showed their true colors in the early days when they decided to try to ban Revive, a program which allowed legitimately purchased Oculus games on HTC's Vive. They've continued these anti-consumer, anti-competitive practices with the Rift. Oculus has elected to block Virtual Desktop from streaming desktop VR games that consumers had legitimately purchased, many of which were simply unavailable on the Quest, with no reason given beyond the obvious. They have also blocked a number of developers' games such as To The Top without good reason. The Quest could be great, but unfortunately the platform is compromised by Oculus's greed. Don't support anti-consumer practices. Don't buy the Quest.

I've owned a Oculus Rift DK2, a HTC Vive and a Samsung Odyssey. My VR PC(7700k/1080Ti) cost me over $2000. The Quest cost $400 and works by just putting it on right out of the box. No plugging anything into anything else. No installing anything on a PC. No setting up sensors on your wall. Nothing. You take it out of the box, put it on and get into VR. This doesn't make sense.This piece of hardware shouldn't exist for another 3-5 years but here it is. AND IT'S GOOD. REALLY GOOD. So good that, for me, it's been on par with my $2500 PC-VR setup. Yes. a $400 headset that utilizes a mobile system-on-a-chip is giving me as good a VR experience as a PC Master Race VR setup.If you're on the fence, GET THE OCULUS QUEST.

I’m a huge gamer, but always felt VR wasn’t where I needed it to be for me personally. After waiting nearly 20 years from when I was standing in a small circular stand looking at Green lines (VR), I felt the Quest might have been what I was waiting for.  Oculus Quest blew my expectations away. I’ve been freaking out telling everyone I know how amazing it is. At one point playing Superhot I was going to step off a building and my body wouldn’t let me do it. I started breathing heavy and actually had to lift up the headset to tell my brain “no look we really will be fine”. I spent 9.5 hours in the quest (purchased and Anker power pack) and purchased 80% of the games out there. Thank you Oculus for this all in one, wireless and extremely immersive system. After a lifetime of gaming (starting with Pong-I’ve owned literally every system) I feel this was the greatest and most exhilarating gaming experience of my life. It felt like I was on Star Trek’s Holodeck. Amazing! I’d recommend getting: Superhot, Drop Dead, Beat Saber, I Expect You to Die, Sport Scramble

There seems to be a major problem with the Oculus Quest charging. I purchased 2 units. After 3 weeks, neither would charge anymore. Left to charge for 3 days it went from 3% to 11% with no use. Oculus does not have a customer support number. You have to send an email. Then, they don’t get back to you. My 900 dollars worth of units are useless after 3 weeks. Google it.

A recent firmware update has caused the Quest units to experience brief, intermittent blackouts in addition to tracking issues.  This is confirmed by hundreds of people on the reddit forums.  Oculus support is useless, since they do not publicly acknowledge that the problem is firmware related, and instead tell you to perform factory resets, do reboots, change play spaces, etc.  Rather than admit to the systemic problems, they prefer to waste the customer's time, adding to the frustration.  If they can iron out the glitches, then the device is worth consideration.  But for now, stay away.

I'm just one day in, so these are only preliminary impressions.TL;DR: I am extremely happy with the Quest except for its propensity to stop tracking the left touch controller; unknown if this is an isolated problem.I will update this review when I have a resolution. (EDIT: May 29, See below)Comfort: the headset fits securely once you get the hang of adjusting the straps (it's only three pieces of velcro, but it takes some actual fiddling to get it right the first few times). The sweet spot for the lenses is small, so getting the thing aligned with your eyeballs without putting too much pressure on your face/back of your head is key to a good experience. There is also a welcome simple adjustment for inter-ocular distance. Speakings of eyes, as a glasses wearer, there are extra complications. The Quest comes with a glasses spacer (which is great) to give more depth inside the headset, but my trouble came with my glasses' *width*--they just won't fit inside. I am (mostly) near-sighted with a few old-guy vision issues, so it's not the end of the world, but would be better with narrower frames (or custom prescription lenses for the Quest, which is an after-market option!)Build Quality: The unit feels like a premium piece of gear. No complaints with fit, finish or packaging. Seems to be both sturdy and attractive with an understated aesthetic.Immersion: I have only had a few other limited VR experiences (some dating back to the first wave of VR in the 90s; Terrordactyl, anyone?) but I was extremely impressed with the in-VR experience. The ""First Steps"" and ""First Contact"" tutorials are both great in their own way, with ""Steps"" having more complete tutorialization and and ""Contact"" being much more visually satisfying (and more fun!) it's just a little weird that there is so much overlap in content between the two...anyhow, the ability to grasp, point, smack and otherwise manipulate immaterial objects came surprisingly easily. The Touch controllers became second-nature for me in a matter of minutes (I think my daughter's adjustment time was measured in seconds). The sense of scale and motion is excellent, and the ability to walk around in a larger play space is amazing. The six-degrees-of-freedom is a big advantage over the Quest's little brother Go. The Art direction, sound and UI design in the provided experiences is top-notch and feels highly polished.Visuals: Definitely a compromise when compared to PC-tethered alternatives--just compare in-game screenshots for Beat Saber and Robo Recall for a reference. The screen-door of the pixel grid is present, but not overwhelming. Dark scenes seem a little smudgey, as if there is not enough dynamic range. For me, all of this is worth the freedom to take and use the unit anywhere there is clear floor space. 1337 Ga/\/\0Rs will probably turn up their noses, but I think it's more than a fair trade-off.And the one glaring problem: My left controller loses tracking with the headset with a distressing regularity. Sometimes, every few minutes. Very occasionally the right one as well. This completely breaks immersion and makes Beat Saber an exercise in extreme frustration. The problem is can be rectified by removing and replacing the AA battery in the controller (I have come to greatly appreciate the magnetic battery door latch), but soon recurs.I have no idea if I got a defective unit or if this will turn out to be a widespread problem. I have put in a trouble ticket with Oculus for this, so we'll see what happens and I will update the review here when I hear.One star off for now.EDIT: My tracking issues turned out to be environmental; the Quest seems to hate to have sunlight (especially changing sunlight) and other IR sources in view. This can be exacerbated by having reflective surfaces in the play area.A combination of granite counter tops in the open kitchen, lots of framed prints, a slightly shiny floor and sun spilling in through the blinds seems to be my particular problem. Support at Oculus via email was great.Would be nice if I could play in the living room, but I will have to find an alternate space.

Battery doesn't last long for 1 thing. Might not even last the length of a movie.  Also, after unplugging it from charger and letting it sit, it'll be dead in a few days.

Coming from a Rift, I'm very impressed with Quest.  CONS: I definetly feel all of the weight in the front and I find it to be not too comfortable after a while. The sound that comes out sounds very spatial and natural, but the volume is too low and bass notes sound terrible and distorted. Instead I'm using headphones with a 6"" coiled cable for a much better experience.  The tracking is not as good as Rift, you do lose position of hands if they are beside or behind you, but you get used to that quickly.PROS: The screens look great, a noticeable improvement from Rift with less ""screen door effect"". The new lenses also have ""God rays"" but they are not as noticeable. The quality of visuals the custom snapdragon 835 in this headset is able to output is amazing. ""Vader Immortal"" stands out, you can tell they took full advantage and optimized for this game for this headset because this game looks as good as any Rift game somehow, no $1000 pc required, and this gets me excited about future titles. The fact that there's no wire attached is also a big plus, you can get as fancy as you want with your movements. Battery life seems to be around 2 hours playing games and everything just feels high quality. What this device gives you for $400 is incredible.

Setting up room-scale tracking was extremely easy as well, not having to screw base stations into the wall or place sensors any where made it a breeze. The one thing that amazed me right out of the box was how I could make a play area larger than ever before, and walk around flawlessly with no tracking errors, dodging couches, chairs, and walls due to Oculus Guardian.The next part that amazed me was the responsiveness of the controllers paired with the quality of the screen. While games have lower graphics than PC powered graphics, everything was still great and no motion sickness with the 70 hz refresh rate. I love the form factor and set up of the Oculus controllers; the controllers are 10 times better than that of the HTC VIVE (until Index VR Controllers are released). Starting up the first game I bought, SuperHOT VR (a must buy for anyone just starting VR or wanting to play a fun game that never gets boring), and it ran flawlessly. I originally had an HTC VIVE and sold it for the portability of the Quest, and I could not tell the difference in graphics in SuperHOT (I could notice it with some games but most games ran like a dream). Playing games truly wireless is a godsend, I felt that it was exactly what we need to bring VR to the masses. People possibly wonder however, what about the SteamVR games for previous VIVE or Oculus owners, well luckily to a website called RiftCat, you can stream SteamVR titles using PC graphics to the Quest with a stable Wi-Fi connection.My friends and I when using the VIVE would rate a game's immersive-ness by seeing how well we know where we are oriented before taking off the VIVE, and if we could not notice the orientation, it would be deemed as an immersive title. Very few games achieved that (Rec Room, Raw Data, Arizona Sunshine, and sometimes TheLab). But now, with the use of no wires, being completely free in a VR world, almost every game we try on the Quest is immersive (one time I took it off and started from the couch all the way to the microwave, which is about 20 ft of walking). Almost every time before I take off the headset, I have had no idea what way I am facing/rotated in my room.The next thing which I appreciate is the integrated speakers. While there is a headphone jack, including speakers instead of headphones adds a nice touch where everything still feels immersive but giving us enough of a presence in our surroundings (when a friend tells us something while playing we can hear it, or when dogs are barking, someone is knocking on the door, all can be successfully heard).The next thing that I like is the head-strap. The head-strap is extremely adjustable making it easy to slip on and off when switching between players. And the other nice touch is that there is a slight elasticity to the strap where when you pull on it, it expands and contracts, meaning when I take it off, the strap lengthens (without feeling tighter) and when I put it bag on it tightens to a nice snug fit.One might wonder about being with other people and whether or not they can see what you are doing, but luckily they added the option to Cast the player's view onto a TV using Google Chromecast. This works, but is still in beta so it sometimes causes a little bit of throttling/motion sickness.With everything I love, there are two things I would have liked to see added to the Quest:First: the option to plug a long cable from the Quest to the PC, allowing PC graphics to be played on the Quest, when you are home but still having the standalone option for traveling. While RiftCat is an option, fast Wi-Fi is not always an option to everyone.Second: updating the SOC to a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 with the Adreno 640 GPU, improving the graphics by up to around 40% and improving the speed and power efficiency at the same time. Hopefully they continue to update the chipset every year with the latest and greatest Snapdragon Processor and Adreno GPU.Overall, for the amazing price, portability, tracking, gameplay and immersiveness, the Oculus Quest is an amazing device that I would highly recommend getting. I love this so much that I am pretty sure this is the longest review I have written-that is how much I love this product.

I wanted to have the Oculus Quest for about a month before I left a review.  I figured this would give me time to really get to know the headset.  There's tons of other reviews out there so there was no rush to get mine up.I will get to the review later, but for now I have to share something that some folks might not know that may be a deal breaker for them.The Oculus headsets do not support cloud saves.  So any progress you make in a game on your Oculus Quest is attached to that headset.  If something happens to it, there goes all your progress.Yesterday due to the recent update, I was having issues with my right controller, like many others.  Tech Support Brandon had me do a factory reset without bothering to mention that in doing so, I would lose all my saved progress on all of my games.  What current console doesn't support cloud saves? Heck, even the Switch got on board with that!This is a deal breaker for me and I will likely send the headset back.I'll get to the larger review when I'm not so angry.  I just wanted to let folks know about the absence of cloud saving before they buy.

This is the real deal! Best VR experience I have yet tried (used Vive and Gear VR before). Perfect hand control tracking and much better visuals than expected giving the 2 year old mobile processor.  Vader Immortal is an experience that every fan of Star Wars has to try at least once. Better than Star Tours at Disney.  Freedom of movement is the killer feature here and it doesn't dissapoint by giving you walking and rotating freedom.  Screen Door Effect is greatly reduced and only a problem when watching video. Pixels are very small, better than Gear VR on the Galaxy S10 which is already better than most. Guardian boundary system is incredible and makes it safe for everybody anywhere. I got goosebumps and felt scared a few times from heights and dangers. Very convincing and realistic. Creed is a crazy good experience even with all it's flaws, be sure to raise your gloves and look up. ;-)Why 4 stars instead of 5?  Headset is too front heavy and starts to hurt your cheek bones and nose bridge after 10min.  They need to get the second iteration of these electronics to be attached at a belt or other tyoe of clip with a small video and power wire that is unobtrusive to a screen only headset that is lite. Very few titles at launch with so many missing like Google Maps VR and any sort of travel panorama app. They should come in due time.  Titles are too expensive for the most part, Beat Saber for $29 ... really? They need to get into the $10 area.  Games are quite short in duration and they are as expensive as hundred hour games on PC.  Battery life is ok about 2hrs 10min on 3D games but expect to use a power pack to enjoy it better. Audio is ok but you should use real headphones, also everyone around you can hear your game which is annoying. Tracking needs light in room to work. Seems it is not IR  which would have been ideal. No way to use it in the dark unless you de activate guardian mode which is not recommended in developer mode.Can't wait to see more titles and apps at better prices too, this is an incredible product and experience. I have seen the future of entertainment and it started this month with the Oculus Quest!!! By version 3 in a few years it will probably replace most consoles and TVs. For a version 1 product, I was blown away! Full body and feet tracking/feedback is coming, what an exciting time to be alive!

***UPDATE***As of late 2021 this Unit is now the Red-headed Stepchild to the Kingdom of Occulus.  Once recognized as a practical gateway to VR...It was ever so quickly replaced by it's Little 'BIG' Brother Occulus Quest 2, which currently reigns supreme.  There is no need to buy a Quest 1, it is simply inferior.  I took 1 star away from my review due to the 'OBSOLETE' factor with Quest 1.  it was Quickly replaced by Quest 2, in fact of the best optimized games are 'EXCLUSIVE' to Quest 2, making it pointless to even consider purchasing a Quest 1.  that is all.I'm going about this review in a different fashion as i'm going to compare 3 different VR experiences I've had with Modern Day VR.First I will say that I am really liking everything about this VR unit...I have only played for 1 or 2 hours at this point but it's not my 1st Rodeo with VR, so to speak.  I have my own WMR (Mixed Reality) headset by Acer that is hooked up to my PC.  I also have played PSVR on a base level PS4.Most of my experience comes from many hours of fun on the Acer unit.  here's my summary viewpoint on each of these just so that it gives you an idea of product comparisons...Acer WMR Unit - In my opinion it has the edge on graphics.  Decent tracking but requires excellent light source to function properly and consistently, otherwise the tracking drops.  Constant framerate drops and seems glitchy with higher end titles.  Hardware doesn't require much in wires, much less than PSVR, but more cables than Quest.Hardware is the most inferior in design and quality.  forehead buffer has been know to actually disconnect from Headset completely if it's sitting idle!  bad adhesive I guess??  also feels light and cheap.  Only real positive is the unit flips up by the eye/forehead section, so you can take a quick break without removing the entire unit off your head.  This is awesome for adult beverage consumption, among other nefarious activity choices.PSVR - Not a lot of experience with this but the graphics are good, not great.  I only played with a base level PS4, not a PRO.  Lots of cables which is a negative, but the quality of the hardware is a solid design, not cheap.  well built to last and is comfortable.  Has the best Library of software, although no access to Steam.  This is basically not a portable unit, it's supposed to, meant to, remain stationary next to your PS4.  It's my least favorite of the 3 VR unit styles.Occulus Quest - 2nd best graphics of the 3 units I'm comparing.  This unit is the most comfortable, although a tad heavier than I would like.  Paddles are nice but I wish they were just a bit longer.Hardware portability and ease of use is so much the key with the Quest.  it's so convenient and for that alone it will probably be a major focal point with Marketing & Sales.  I can see this product doing very well for a long duration of time especially if they continue to add content.There are no wires!  except a charge cable.  so awesome.  the tracking is also the best i've seen out of the 3 units, best by a longshot too.Software wise it seems easy as 1-2-3.  Buy something on your smartphone app or in the headset software portal then just download and boom!  you're ready to rock.In short, the Occulus Quest is going to be my favorite of the 3 unit experiences...EVENTUALLY.  I know it will.  Right now it's in the 'infancy' stage, brand spankin' new as of this review i'm writing.  I can tell once it gets a massive library of game titles and other apps it will be much better.  I also look forward to seeing some firmware updates in the future to make this unit even better.The negatives I see right now are the lack of content, which is common for any launch VR or game system so whatever.  not going to knock it down a peg or 2 because of that.The sound, it lacks volume.  Would recommend headphones even just ear buds, this REALLY HELPS.  The sound however is very very clear.The graphics are probably a 7.5 out of 10.  so a bit of a let down but not a deal breaker either.  I'm wondering if this is something that can be improved upon over time?  maybe not.Not much in the realm of Cons so far.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is just getting into owning their first VR headset, as well as someone who travels a lot.  The Quest is basically grab-n-Go if you want it to be.i'm looking forward to diving into it some more but so far I'm really impressed.

I own the Rift and Vive VR headsets and I bought this for something to travel with and bring over to friends houses to play VR games like Beat Saber and cast them to the TV for everyone to enjoy.The setup is really easy. Drawing your guardian boundaries works better on this device than any other VR setup I've used.The device comes out of the box with a strong odor that has dissipated a little but hasn't gone away completely. I assume it will with time.The device has the ability to cast what you see to a supported Chromecast device, but many titles including Beat Saber and Vader Immortal don't allow you to, so its a pretty pointless feature for me. Also, it doesn't cast audio at all. It's video only. This feature has been shown with Beat Saber in pre-release videos so I was really surprised it didn't work.I get a lot of artifacts when playing games or using the Netflix app. Flickers of white dots and lines keep me from any sense of immersion. I haven't seen this issue reported anywhere else online, so it may just be a defect in my device.Having to buy all of these games again is a pain as well. A few games support cross-buy if you purchased them in the Oculus store, but most of mine were purchased on Steam so I have to re-buy every game that I want to play.Overall its impressive that Oculus was able to do everything they're doing with the hardware inside the Quest but without audio/video casting working in all games, it's not useful to me.

This is my first VR system, so I can't compare it with Rift, but this is one of the most amazing things I've ever experienced. You completely feel like you're part of whatever environment you're in. When I accidentally drop a ping pong ball in Racket Fury, I instinctively try to catch it with my foot. When I'm getting ready to fight the somewhat cartoonish boxers in Creed, I get an adrenaline rush because my brain is telling me I'm going to get my *ss kicked. Even the simple ability to put yourself inside Google Maps with Wander, or to watch a Netflix movie on a giant screen in a huge mountain retreat -- it's unreal. I can't wait to see where this will go in future iterations.If there are any cons for me, it's that the headset can get pretty uncomfortable after a while, and the battery life isn't amazing--you get roughly two hours before you have to charge it again. Also, I wish it wasn't owned by the evil empire, Facebook.All that being said, I would buy this again in a heartbeat.EDIT: The physical volume button stopped working a couple days in, although I could still change it from the settings menu. Then a couple days later, I was playing a game when it all of a sudden shut down and went to a menu screen and wouldn't let me select anything. None of the buttons did anything. I couldn't even power it off or do a factory reset. It's now inoperable. I submitted a service request a couple days ago and haven't heard anything so far. We'll see how the return/replacement process goes...

I have owned a Oculus Rift for a few years now, which I really loved at the time.Over time I found that I would rarely actually use it, as it took quite an effort to set everything up (3 sensors).Being a Mac user, this came with additional issues, as Apple somehow refuses to provide some potent GPU's or a reasonable GPU upgrade path. So I found myself using a Windows machine each time I wanted to play (with nVidia 1060).  It has always been an impressive experience though.Last week I did get myself the Oculus Quest, and boy did a world of fun open for me.No more setup, no PC needed with beefy GPU, no annoying wires.Just take the headset, put it on, and you're good to go!When I received the Quest, it took about 10 minutes to get started for the first time (including unboxing), and in the passed days I have found myself using the Quest frequently.-> Note for Oculus: add a page to your quickstart guide, showing what button does what and showing how to power off the device properly, would have been good.The best part is definitely that the entire exercise of ""getting started"" has been cut down to almost zero time.Just take the headset, put it on, verify the guardian, and you're good to go. This was definitely not the case with the Rift.Speaking of the Guardian; it seems to remember earlier settings, which is nice when you're playing on the same spot again in the future. Being able to see your surroundings while setting the Guardian is awesome!  Something I missed with the original Rift.Since the headset includes an Android device and a battery pack, it is, understandably, a little heavier, but I have to say that I didn't notice this while using it.On that note: the headset has significantly improved for those wearing glasses. A special insert will provide a little bit more room.The controllers are different than the ones that come with the Rift as well, and I'd say they are an improvement as well.The battery gives me quite a bit of play time (about 2 hours), and if needed one can charge while playing (charger or Powerbank - it seems the USB-c charger/Powerbank should at least support 5V/2.6A). I haven't had a need for that, because after 2 hours of playing, it's nice to take a little break anyway.Charging the headset is relatively fast, it seems the provided charger is 18W, so maybe a beefier charger will do things quicker. I haven't tested that yet.As one can imagine, the graphics (details) are not as great as the Rift (lack of beefy GPU). Games like ""Robo Recall"" play very smooth, but the textures are of a much lower, but acceptable, quality. The quality is enough to have a very smooth and acceptable experience. Having said that; the picture is very clear and seems a little better than the Rift, but not by much. The headset does seem to fit better though than the Rift.The sound was actually a surprise. Where with the Rift one had little speakers over the ear, the Quest seems to have ""nothing"" yet the sound is surprisingly good. An optional headset/earbuds can be used, but I haven't had a need for it yet.Linking the Quest to my XBox One controller worked off the bat as well, which I needed since I wanted to sideload Half-Life and Quake (sidequest - sidequestvr.com). Obviously, the old Half Life and Quake games are very low-res, but it was a fun experience anyway as you can move around more freely (compared to ""Robo Recall"" where you have to jump from one location to the other).One cool thing Oculus did as well, is that when a title is available for the Rift and the Quest, your previously bought games will be available on the Quest as well (eg. Robo Recall).Another cool thing is the Oculus Quest for your smartphone. It not only gives you easy access to all kinds of settings, the store, your library etc, but ... it also allows you to view what the player is viewing or even cast the video feed to ChromeCast. This is great when wanting to follow a player or when wanting to help out those new to the VR experience.Now one downside is that the game selection is, at this moment, still a little limited.SideQuest adds a few extras, but it is not for everybody.Some games of the Rift are re-done for the Quest (Robo Recall for example), and some have a ""version 2"" for the Quest. For example the super cool demo ""Face your Fears"" (Rift) is available for the Quest as ""Face your Fears 2"" - unfortunately though, it's not even close to the original. It's a completely different ""game"".This actually bummed me out a little, since I used ""Face your Fears"" to show new VR users the cool immersive feeling when using a VR (it's awesome!). The new version is not anywhere close to that experience and has no resemblance with the previous version whatsoever.-> So to the maker of ""Face your Fears"" - please redo the original for the Oculus Quest as well!A few accessories one could consider buying;1. A hardshell case.I got this one, which first perfect and even holds charger and my XBox One controller: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WCRS6D4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=tweaki-20&linkId=e269d682b3f9a6abf75cce49062b1d1c&language=en_US2. Optionally a lens protector - a little insert to make sure direct sunlight doesn't hit the lenses, and to prevent scratches when the Quest is stored. Still looking for this, and for now I use the little cardboard insert that came with the Quest.3. Some kind of hygienic wipes/masks/etc to prevent shearing sweat ;-)I'm still looking for something that would do the trick.4. A powerbank, if you want to remain untethered while playing with a drained battery.All-in-all, I'd highly recommend the Oculus Quest, and I'm curious what Oculus will do with the next generation.If you ever decide to sell the Quest, you'd find a buyer much easier, as there are no additional requirements (like with the Rift) for the potential buyer.

I was sad to see that I received a faulty headset that had dried glue over the inside of the lens that needless to say makes the experience less than pleasant and blurry.

 First of all, this is better than any other VR headset I have tried and that has a lot to do with the wireless nature of it. The biggest drawback here is that some games at some points gets very pixelated since this system is not very powerful. It is also a bit heavy so if your head is small... this will feel incredibly heavy and uncomfortable. I have attached a video showcasing what you get in the box and what the setup process is like. If you plan on getting this... do download the Oculus app on your mobile phone and create a Oculus account so you can skip that step when you get the headset!

So first impressions. Got my Quest delivered this morning, and the setup was crazy easy. You install an app on your phone, pop it out of the box, and are basically good to go.There are about 5 demos to check out as well as a basic tutorial about how the controllers work. I do recommend that you have at least 12’ by 12’ to work with for your play area. Installed Vader Immortal and Beat Saber... both of which are AAA releases and are sufficiently badass! Can’t wait to try more games in the next few days.Overall the wireless setup, decent graphics(with a bit of “screen door” effect) and 6 degrees of movement without separate sensors make this tech toy very exciting and great to bust out to impress friends. It’s not cheap, but if you have the money and want to get your mind blown I can’t help but recommend it.

Wow! Just wow! I’ve wanted to love VR for awhile now. Started with Google Cardboard. Tried the Gear VR when I had a Samsung phone. Even bought a PS VR for my PS4. That one was definitely a step above the first two but I just never used it much. Last year I bought the Oculus Go thinking being untethered to a TV might be what I want. It’s collecting dust as well.The Quest? Can’t stop using it. I now realize it’s not so much the untethered nature that’s attractive, but the 6DOF and camera enhanced camera tracking.Yes, the graphics of this are better than the Go. Yes, I realize the graphics on a Rift S or Vive would be better, but I was never going to invest all that money into a gaming PC, I’m far too casual a user. That said, this is so immersive, it’s mesmerizing.Being able to draw out the dimensions of the room you’re in helps. You can literally walk around after doing so. If you get a bit too close to the edge, a virtual wall begins to appear to prevent you from walking into the real wall. The other thing that makes it a winner is the camera tracking and controllers. Being able to have the game recognize you leaning, or ducking is key, being able to grasp objects with your VR hands, having an articulating couple of fingers (not ten, but a couple) really changes the game.It’s still a gimmick for video playing, I downloaded a 3D movie, plus have tried things like the Netflix app and the Prime Video app. They’re fun for a bit, but the video quality/resolution just isn’t there yet. But for playing games (even casual ones like the addicting Poker game that’s free) - let’s just say if you’re like me (a casual gamer) this is probably the device to own right now.

A hardware platform is only as strong as the software available on it. There is a dismal amount of content on the platform, similar to the apps available on a first generation iphone. The hardware itself is amazing, but their ""walled garden"" approach means that the software will always be mediocre at best. The tech is ALMOST there, give it one more generation and we'll have a VR headset that isn't this walled garden nonsense!

My family and friends have loved this. Are the graphics bleeding edge? No. Does it boast a huge battery life? No.But! It does have great graphics and a few hours of battery life. It does allow you the freedom to be cable free and a view into the expanding VR market. All without having to invest in a costly PC system. To be honest, I mainly use this in short bursts and place it back on the charger. Or, I just use the VERY long charger cable while I play more intensive games, like Pavlov. Be sure to look into SideQuest so you can side load apps.Very happy to see where VR is headed. I will say this, this unit is very overpriced for the hardware, but I get it. It's still sort of Niche and new, so they can charge more. My only concern is the cheap controllers and how easily you can mistakenly remove the battery covers (most noticeable while playing tennis style games).I feel for the price, they could have either added a better battery compartment, Sleeves, Controller housing material.So far the little bugs are not really worth mentioning besides the device dropping wifi in clear view of the router (on multiple networks under low load). But, I would say the Price for sure. Had my roommate not agreed to pay half, I would not have owned this.If anything changes or after mid / long term use proves other faults to be an issue, I will update this review. For now, I am leaving this at 5 stars.

I've owned other VR headsets (Vive and Oculus Go) and loved them both. For this reason my expectations for Quest were modest. How well could a mobile chipset handle not just gaming, but wireless gaming in 6DOF and tracking two controllers? I hoped for the best but expected to be mildly disappointed. Well, the Quest did not meet my expectations, it FAR EXCEEDED them! This is somehow a BETTER experience than I had in VR powered by a full fledged gaming PC. Visuals are great, no wires to worry about tripping over, tracking is PERFECT, and the convenience is too good to be true. Haven't been so impressed by a new product since the original iPhone. This is a game changer.

Where do I start? It came earlier than anticipated and the box was sealed, the product appeared to be in new condition, I say that because some people have reported getting used equipment or missing equipment, not so in this purchase. I charged it and put the batteries into the hand held controls and I loved that the doors of the devices were magnetic, they slid right into place and stayed! So far, we have played hours with the batteries that came with it, but I would suggest purchasing double A batteries, either Duracell or a brand name, I have actually thought about purchasing nicad rechargeable batteries. The games are so realistic, zero gravity will make you feel like you are floating and when you play the Darth Vader game, hold on to yoru socks, if you love Star Wars, you will absolutely love this game!  I swear, the reality of this is incredible.  Now the CONS. The head set isn't very stable, it feels like it might fall off when you are wearing it and it isn't very comfortable for long periods of time. The place where your nose fits has a crack that allows light to come in, often times making the experience not so great. ( I am going to use some foam to block that out) The straps seem flimsy and cheap, I am going to modify this headset, so it will work better, I might even use the straps from an older version of a VR set I have that has more padding and comfort. I will see. The fitting of the head piece is a challenge, because if you don't get it just right, the field of view can seem blurry in places, leading you to think the lenses need cleaning, when they don't. The weight of the helmet isn't that bad, I didn't feel like it was too heavy or bulky, I didn't think it distracted at all the experience. Again, I want to redesign the straps, and the foam, perhaps making it more secure and comfortable. Now don't get me wrong, it isn't that bad that I want to send it back, this is definitely a keeper! Now the games I found were a bit elementary, with the exception of the first person shooter games. I thought that the graphics seemed rudiment and elementary and would appeal more to those who are under the age of 13. I did find that the Vader game is the best, although the Seals type game I want but at 30 bucks, Ill wait a while. There are many free games and you can demo a lot of the games before purchasing them, and this is something I really liked. When you purchase a game, you can play it less than two hours and if you don't like it, you can request a refund, something I have never heard of before, but my 12 year old son told me about it, after he purchased plank and felt it wasn't what he wanted. Saber game is a great one to, its fun and you definatley get a workout! I love to fly, so I would love a real flying style game, I hope that eventually the makers will develop one. There is another game that is about climbing and it looks like a lot of fun. I think there are enough games out there to justify purchasing this head set. I loved that you aren't tethered either! This gives you a lot of freedom when playing games. Now about the reality of the Virtual reality. At times, I find that my mind interprets the environment as so real, I want to walk about and explore this world, it is so real, at times, my heart beats faster, because my brain has interpreted the environment as reality! I am so excited about this headset, I can only hope that as time goes on, they will develop more games, like Sony Play Station and X Box, but for now the Virtual world and the reality world they offer is incredible. I haven't used it to do google explore, I am really looking forward to that, my daughter did and she said, Daddy, it was just like being there, I was at the Eiffel Tower! So out of vie stars, I would give it four, only because of the headset and the limited games, but a solid four! Would I buy it again? You bet your socks I would.

As a long time Vive owner (currently using a Vive Pro and original lighthouses) I was honestly *shocked* that the Oculus Quest worked as well as it did. Despite being 100% standalone and portable, the 6DoF tracking on this thing is almost indistinguishable from my Vive, despite not having a dedicated room with mounted lighthouse sensors. It smartly switches off when not in use and boots up in seconds when you're ready to hop into VR, allowing you to play VR sessions up to three hours or just smack notes in Beatsaber for five minutes with literally no friction.The thing also works everywhere - on my first day I set it up in a conference room, my garage, my living room, and my basement - and the tracking has malfunctioning (like, maybe a second or two to sync up) perhaps twice in four days of usage. Amazingly, the image inside the headset is even more clear than my OG Vive and on par with my Vive Pro (granted, it's running lower rez, but still) and the framerate is flawless in most every game I've tried.In short, the Quest does everything we were promised at a totally reasonable $400 price point. It's an incredible device, and the freedom to go completely wireless and play anywhere (so long as there's not a super bright light or mirrored surface) far outweighs the minor loss of graphical fidelity from not having a desktop setup. I'm not abandoning my desktop PC or Vive Pro (I still use those for modded Skyrim and other high-intensity games) but I can't imagine playing games like Beatsaber, Superhot, or similar experiences on anything but my quest. Wireless is key.If you've been wanting to get into high quality VR and have balked at the price of a desktop PC and new Rift/Vive/Microsoft HMD, just get the Oculus Quest. It's great. And if you already have a desktop PC setup, get a Quest anyway.  The portability of the Quest can't be matched, and I love that I can be in Beatsaber (or a similar app) in under 10 seconds flat whenever I have a few minutes to spare. The Quest is as close to a ""Ready Player One"" headset as you can get right now, and an exciting step forward for VR in general.

If this review were limited to just to playing the oculus itself I would give 5 stars.  It is super fun to play, has good games, and the multiplayer function is amazing.  I can play games with my friend across the country and it feels like he is actually in the room. You can even cast the screen up so everyone can see what you are playing and join along in the experience. And this is even considering we've been down a controller for half the time we've owned it (more on this below).BUT... you better hope and pray that nothing goes wrong and you don't have to interface with customer service.  Unfortunately the left controller that came with the system was malfunctioning out of the box.  It would work sometimes but would intermittently turn off or start jumping around/floating off into space.  I immediately went to the website which has a somewhat helpful troubleshooting section but none of the proposed solutions worked. I then contacted their customer service which quickly devolved into my worst customer service experience ever.The first thing is the only way to interface with customer service is via email/messaging- there is no phone call option.  Upon sending the message they quickly inform you that their response my take up to 2-3 business days. I will spare you the gory details, but essentially after suggesting all of the things that were already on the website and pretty clearly establishing there was something wrong with the controller, they said they would ""look into it further"" and get back to me in 3-5 business days.  It was only after emailing again to express my frustration that they responded that I did indeed need a new controller.  Essentially what could have been concluded after a 15 minute phone call took an entire week of back and forth emails.  Even worse was that every single message from the oculus support team was from a different person so I was dealing with a new person every time.The customer service then informed me that they would happy to send me a new controller AFTER I sent in the defective one and after 3-5 days of processing.  They provided a label for UPS Ground (AKA slow) and when I asked why they couldn't send a new controller once they were able to see I has shipped the defective one they said that they don't have control over the replacement process.I provided feedback via their requested link and they reached out to me to see if there was anything they could do. I expressed my displeasure about the fact that in total it will take me >3 weeks to get a new controller to replace the one that was defective out of the box and that the vast majority of the games are unplayable with one single controller.  I expected them to offer something helpful like a list of games that one can play with one controller and the response I got was (and I quote): ""I appreciate your frank feedback about our support system, and we are continually working to improve the customer experience. I'll be sure to share it with the team.""TL;DR- System and games are great and I would give it 5 stars.  However, the customer service was so bad I docked it two full stars.Should you have the misfortune of needing to interface with customer service get ready for a bumpy ride. We got a defective controller out of the box and it will take 3+ weeks to get a replacement and has caused a lot of headaches.UPDATE 10/7/20:Now my right controller has stopped working and I had to go through the same process again to get it replaced.  This time around they told me they will send a ""refurbished"" controller.  I asked to have the situation escalated to a supervisor given it was (what I hope) a rare occurrence of hardware failing twice, but was told it was not possible.  Now I'm in the process of waiting another 3 weeks to get my replacement controller and am unable to play most of the games.I'm changing my review now to 2 stars.  Again, love the gameplay, but you better hope nothing goes wrong.

Do me a favor and google ""oculus kickstarter"" and watch the 5 minute promo video. You'll see why I say 7 years in the title of this review. This is essentially the culmination of 7 years of hard work, from prototype, to version 1.0, to various iterations and eventually leading to the next gen: a VR experience for the general public. It is not the end all be all VR, meaning...the Quest is not supposed to represent the best VR has to offer, but more like...""the essentials"", or a fine balance of what you need to really get the A-ha moment, or to share this experience with those who are not in the loop. Honestly, even just a few minutes with the first demo experience is enough for anyone to really see - this is not just another gimmick device. It really is piece of technology that represents the next gen. Sort of like how when Steve Jobs first presented the iPhone, and said ""we are announcing three products..."" and the crowd all of a sudden got it, it all clicked. I feel that the Oculus Quest really brings that level of ""enlightenment"". It's quite special and even though it may seem like a high price tag...in fact it is only a small price to pay to really get that experience in your hands and those around you.

I love video games.  I also have a family and a demanding job.  My time for gaming is limited.  I already had the Playstation VR, so I am not new to VR.  This headset is amazing mainly because it is self contained and is wireless.  Some of the tethered VR headsets are going to be an improvement over this system graphically, but you are giving up the ease of use and freedom of a wireless experience.I keep the headset hidden in my entertainment center in the living room, there are no sensors, wires, etc that are left out.  Getting ready to play takes a couple of minutes and when you are done you put it right back.  You can take it on the road if you want to share the experience with a friend or on a business trip.  So far I have played beat saber, Vader Immortal, and Robo Recall.  I am very impressed with the experience given that this system is running off of a what is essentially a smart phone platform.  The graphics are pretty much PS3/XBOX 360 level of detail, but that really misses the point.  The immersion you feel in the middle of one of these games goes far beyond the graphical fidelity.  Think of this system in line with the Nintendo Wii.  The point is the interaction.  Not having wires attached to you if far more important in my opinion.The other key benefit of this system is it will expose non gamers to VR.  4-5 non gamers tried this out at my house last weekend and all of them were blown away.  Very similar to playing Wii bowling with your wife/girlfriend or mom/dad, its just easy to understand and very approachable.Having an uncluttered space to play is key.  Being on your feet and walking around through the virtual play space is the main benefit of a wireless system.  The system wants a 6.5 foot square to allow you to move around the room during play, but you can always go bigger.  You use one of the controllers to draw out the safe zone.  During game play you will see a mesh wall appear when you get close to the edge.  You can stick your head through the safe zone wall and the view will change to a black and white video feed of the room.  This is amazing, and really helpful if you hear a strange noise need to communicate with someone in your home.  The other feature I should mention is the headset has built in speakers.  This allows you the play games, but still hear ambient noise in the room.  If you have kids, its probably not a great idea to be blind and deaf at the same time.  You can plug in earbuds for a more immersive experience, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you are solo.I have found that VR is best in short chunks, like 15-30 minutes.  Most of the games feel more like arcade games and I think that is the right experience.  You are moving around and depending on the game it can be a pretty active experience.  Play a few rounds of Creed boxing, its not something you will likely want or be able to do for hours.  The ease of setup and wireless nature of the Quest is the ideal VR experience in my opinion regardless of cost.  Its less about the graphical horsepower and more about how you interact.  If you don't want to maintain a dedicated VR space and invest in a dedicated gaming PC, this is the way to go.  I can't wait to see the state of VR in 10-20 more years.  I think wireless is the new minimum standard after giving the Quest a test drive.  Good luck!

I'm a VR fan. I've tried many VR headsets. Phone, PSVR, HTC, and other Oculus headsets. I feel like I'm within the range to talk about this in depth.To start. The screen is very sharp. At least for current standards. You're not looking at real life obviously, but it gets the job done and the pixels are hardly noticeable. I cannot say the same for other headsets where the pixels are too noticeable and very distracting, however I feel like a theater experience when watching videos is a great trade-off for a bit more obvious pixels.That being said, the display and colors still look great, and I enjoy having vibrant colors when watching stuff or playing games. It is a good thing I notice far more than any pixels. It is just as good as all the TV's in my house and my iPad/iPhone, if not better in some aspects.When watching videos, it's definitely a thing you need to get into the habit for, as putting on the headset is a bit time consuming rather than just turning on a TV and sitting down. Until further improvements (which have been confirmed by Oculus to come in 2020 or sooner) are made for tracking, it is near impossible to watch videos at night, which discourages using it, because it needs to use the cameras and know where it is, and where the controllers are. This means keeping a light on, or having a really bright night light. The improvements Oculus are bringing for this issue will be astounding for other programs. The improvements include better tracking at night for controllers, and the ability to track hands so there is no need for controllers, which solves most issues and provides a true VR experience. Cannot wait for this. However until then, watching and playing at night or without any lights is impossible, so if you plan on doing that, wait a while; or don't! It's still fantastic.While I watch videos and movies and TV shows, the audio is great, the screen is great, and the feeling of a ginormous TV in front of you is great. However the best thing in my opinion is how comfortable it is.It's made of fabrics and soft straps, with no plastic pieces or heavy parts. It is still relatively heavy, but compared to other headsets, it's a dream. The weight balance is acceptable, and the straps are never uncomfortable. Watching stuff with this does not make my head hurt like the PSVR does, it's snug but not too snug.About the controllers, I like them. It took some time getting used to them, from other large controllers, but the responsiveness and little quirks about the controllers are wonderful. Just wish the straps wouldn't give out on me, they stopped tightening properly after about 2 months of regular use.The game selection is not very wide right now, but that's ok. The thing came out in May, and it has stuff like Beat Saber and SuperHot, so it's got the fun in those secured. However more quality titles are nowhere to be seen (yet!), and hopefully Oculus is able to bring big games like Minecraft VR, Skyrim VR, Borderlands VR, Etc. All over, because playing those on a PSVR or PCVR is not preferred after getting this headset, due to the fact that it's wireless.The wireless functionality has been the key factor for me. This thing is crazy cool and a humungous step in the right direction for VR. While the battery of the headset won't get you much playtime (2-3 hours, from experience) it sure does give me plenty of time to play wirelessly before plugging in the nonintrusive cable, trick for those wondering - play with the cord plugin into a wall behind you, and run the cord between your legs up to the headset, you won't even notice the charging cord there.As for the portability aspect. This is 1,000% better than anything else for letting friends and family try truly good VR without hauling a full PS4, or hauling a laptop (which most people don't use for VR, a desktop is smarter). I frequently bring this over to others and can hold the whole thing with one hand while carrying anything else I want in the other. I just use the original box it came in. Works fine for me! It's a great party trick, and not a one trick pony. People WILL ask you to bring this over when you visit, if they've tried it and liked it. People WILL ask when you'll bring it next. It doesn't get annoying, but it's funny! Seeing others try VR for the first time (and not garbage phone VR cases) with no wires, no limits, and with a good quality screen + good tracking, it is a wonderful way to pave the love of VR into everyone and get them hooked. I just wish there was a better way for everyone else to watch someone playing a game in VR. The current situation is having your friend put on the headset, with no custom headphones (using the built in speaker audio thingies) go to your phone, go to the Oculus app, and stream the Oculus view onto your phone. There is no audio (as far as I'm aware) transmitted to this cast, which is why I recommend the friend does not wear headphones, because the headset speakers themselves are the only way both the audience and player can hear what's going on. Not to mention the viewing for the audience is on a phone screen. You can cast your phone to a TV, but the lag from an internet connection, and high latency causing long delays onto a TV can make you feel like you're watching images of pixels with bad audio. There absolutely needs to be a revamped casting system for the quest, and I'm sad this is the best method!Unfortunately my first experience was with a phone VR case, and while I loved the concept of VR, it was a poor example for a first impression. I'm glad I stuck around for VR but not everyone is the same, this is a good way to get someone to try out VR and like it.Overall: There are some quirks and downsides. The battery isn't the best, more games could come out, nightime use can drastically improve, and the ability to cast properly are all things that I disliked or was not very happy about. However, the pros heavily outweigh the cons, and I am in no way going to get rid of this bad boy! It is a revolutionary product with many amazing features and a wonderful step for VR into the mainstream audience. If you're reading this and considering, absolutely do. It is worth every penny, especially since it's dirt cheap for the amount of use you'll be getting from it. I would do 9/10 but there are only 5 stars. So 4.5/5!

Recommended mods: Deluxe Audio Strap is an absolute must. -- No way around it.  It will hurt your neck and head if you don't install this mod.Mamut Grips (or similar) are also kind of a must -- they let you let go of the controllers, and they just become a part of your hands -- your fingers move in IRL, they move in game. -- You don't have to grip the controllers the whole time.Rechargeable controllers -- this is a nice to have -- but just search for rechargeable USB batteries and small mini-right angle connectors for them. -- You can dremel out a small hole in the battery cover, so that the wire can come out and down and out of the bottom of the mamut grips. -- Then you can just plug in your controllers and have them always charged.Tactical Airsoft Helmet Counterweight -- lots of people are using all sorts of things for counter weights, including batteries -- but this has worked well for me; just put some velcro on the back of the DAS, and stick one of these to it, and you're good to go.  The nice thing about the airsoft counterweights is that you can calibrate them by removing/adding the little metal lego bricks.  Mine has spots for 5 of them and I use between 2 and 3.There's lots more mods you can do but those are the best ones, IMO.FYI, you can play PCVR games wirelessly with this headset using programs like Riftcat or Virtual Desktop (this has been there since like the second or third week after launch, can't remember).

This is my second Oculus VR set I have owed.  First was the GO and now the QUEST.  I am not a gamer.  I have never owned a XBox or any other system.  I have had this unit for over a month and these are my comments.  I bought the quest so I could be free to move around and have a greater experience and the Quest does not fail.  I have had no issues with my unit remembering different lay outs.  Graphics are incredible, the sound is really good (although head phones are the way to go.  No bugs or lag times  to report when system starts.  The hand controllers are easy to use with several extra buttons for the system to grow into.  Better life on headset is about 2.5 hours.  Headset is a little awkward after the first hour, especially in the back, top.  I’m sure 3rd parties are working on this.  There are many games to choose from ranging from Free to $29.00.  There are moves, videos, porn, And games to choose from that will keep you busy..  5G speed will only make VR and AR more popular next yearI gave the quest 4 stars because the games are to expensive.  I was a little upset to find out my games purchased on GO could not be transferred over, or at least a discount given.  The headset awkward pressure points and battery life all add up to one less star.

I purchased this with the intention of eventually using it for PC VR purposes (once that feature was announced). The quest's ability to function independently from a PC but also having the capability to function as a PC VR headset was what led me to make the purchase. Looking at reviews, it would appear that unless you're a VR Snob, you'll likely not notice the difference. For the price, I'm not sure it could be beat right now.To be honest, though, so far I've not used the PC VR ability.So far, I've been mostly using it for fitness. I've purchased only two games so far: Pistol Whip and BoxVR. Pistol Whip, in a nutshell is a shooting game that acts as my leg day and BoxVR, is a boxing game that works my upper body. Running through just one of the games will generally give me a better workout than a 30 minute ride on a stationary bike. The game aspect allows me to work, without getting bored, for an hour or more if my endurance will allow. My best workout so far (according to my fitness tracker) burned nearly 1000 calories and peaked my heart rate at about 189 bpm. This is fantastic, especially if you live somewhere where inclement weather doesn't allow you to get outside for a run. Likewise, if you're like me and get bored working out, the game aspect keeps me engaged.I do not own any other headset to compare this to so I am unable to give you a solid comparison, other than knowing I'm able to run the games from the Oculus store and don't need to be plugged into a fairly expensive PC. You can take it anywhere. Show it to friends, show it off at a party, take it to work and get a workout in on your lunch break if you've got somewhere to use it (That's what I do).Protips:Buy a lenscover, they shouldn't be more expensive than 10 bucks.Buy a face cover of some sort. The stock one is generally fine to start unless you're using it for fitness and get sweaty easily (I do).If you squeeze the controllers too hard the battery cover might slide off. Buying a cover for them or some scotch tape will help.(I was able to buy all three of the above in a package on amazon for about 25 bucks)After owning it for about a week, I bought a case for it since I take it to and from work. It's not that I mishandle it, it's that a case costs about 25 bucks and the 64GB Quest was still expensive (for me). 25 extra bucks protects it. Harbor Freight carries an Apache Case listed for about that (With a coupon). The Quest and controllers will fit neatly inside it.There are a host of customization options for the Quest. Everything from decals for the front, aftermarket head straps... etc. All of them are pretty innovative and more seem to pop up every week.One complaint I've seen is that there are a lack of games (on the Oculus store) for the quest at the moment. However I would point out that the Quest has only been around about a year and with it constantly being sold out, it would show the demand for games is there. Likewise developers are scrambling to come up with new and exciting content, both for the Quest and for the PC VR market. I would also note that, at the moment, there are developer options that can allow you to access other features or in development games. I would also argue that since it can use the PC VR function, if you get a computer capable of supporting that feature, your game library access expands exponentially.If you have other questions about the Quest or are curious about what accessories are best, there are a host of Youtube personalities who have already been there. Lookup ""BMF"" or ""Eric For President"" or ""Virtual Reality Oasis"" or ""Cas and Chary VR"" since most of them have tried the accessories or games out and you can watch them show you what they're all about and tell you if they're actually worth the money. There are countless others too, the Apache Case I found from the youtube channel ""Tyco Tech.""In all: 5 Stars. It does exactly what I want and more. I'm very pleased with this product.

So first of all, I'm a big time video gamer so when I started hearing about the Quest I really, really wanted one. For my 50th birthday this year, I bought myself one. And well, let's just say I live in Virtual Reality now. Or at least I want to. I can't even describe how awesome this thing is. I wanted to check out the Internation Space Station app which is free and my god, it's so mindblowing. I live in a tiny hut in the Shire, so to be transported to space and to get to do space walks felt like I had escaped into wonder. I almost burst out, ""They should have sent a poet"" ala Jodie Foster in Contact, but I digress. The next thing I did was download Vader Immortal and, after playing though the game with fricken' Darth Vader right in front of me, I decided to spend some time in Vader's Dojo. Let's just say I'm there every night fighting with a lightsaber and getting a wee bit of cardio. Seriously, if you're a geek like me, this thing will change your life. Come to the Dark Side people!

I am not what you’d call a gamer. I have a PS4 and play video games w my kids. Bought this on a whim, and it is mind blowing. All my family and friends have tried it, and even the most skeptical among them have said “oh my GOD” after a few minutes. The system is so smooth, the controller tracking is flawless, and the games are great. My kids love it. I love it.I have only three gripes: 1) the battery life on some intense games is a little low. Sometimes dies after 2 hours. Believe me, it’s very easy to play this system for two hours straight. 2) most games only allow one player profile, so if you’re using the headset for multiple people in a household, you all have to basically share the same progress in every game. Sort of annoying. 3) controllers should be rechargeable. They eat about two AA batteries per week.That being said, I love this thing. I would buy it again and again. It’s easy to use, and it is like nothing else I’ve ever played. It is like you are actually inside the games you’re playing. We love the Star Wars game, Job Simulator, and Racket. But all the games we’ve bought have been awesome.Our PS4 has been almost totally idle since buying the oculus. First thing out of my kids’ mouths when they get home from school is “can we play the oculus?!?”

It took a few weeks to get this after ordering because it was backordered, but it was worth the wait. I've never had a VR system and I understand that this is not quite as technically advanced as something like the Rift; it has a lower-powered processor than the Rift, which from what I understand results in slightly lower resolution and processing speed, but so far I'm completely blown away! The headset is somewhat weighty, but with some adjustment I find it to be fairly comfortable. The controllers are responsive. The Guardian system that allows you to set play space boundaries so you don't bump into things is spot-on, though I wish there was a button to project it at any point, instead of having to get close to it for the barrier grid to show up on the screen. Casting to another device took a bit of work, as the instructions aren't exactly clear, but I got it working. A complaint there is that there is a distracting red dot that shows up in your field of vision to show that you're casting, but it's only slightly to the upper right of your vision; it could definitely be placed further out to it's less intrusive, or even having an option to disable it altogether. It seems that a number of folks have this opinion, and Oculus does have forums where you can suggest future upgrades to the devs.As to the game catalog, there are a number of fun and interesting titles, several of which I can tell greatly benefit from being untethered to a computer. It would be nice if there were more demos so you can try them out before buying; as of now there are only two or three, and a few more non-game experiences would be welcome, but the thing has only been out a few months so I suppose we should give it time. I'm definitely excited to see what games come out in the future, but so far there are some good titles available.One big question I had when considering which to buy was the memory: should I get the 64 or 128GB? I can tell you that I currently have 5 or 6 games and a few apps/experiences loaded, with a fair bit of room left over. And of course, as you complete games you can always delete and then reinstall them later, so I feel that spending the extra $100 for the extra GBs isn't really worth it; save that money to buy some games.In the end, I would say that if you're thinking about buying this or the Rift, you should consider if the lower resolution is a big factor (though I don't think it's that big of a difference, but I could be wrong since I've never used a Rift), and if you're OK being wired into a PC, reducing your range of motion. But if none of that matters to you and you're willing to plunk down $400 on a gaming system, buy this. Buy it now. You may have to wait for it to be in stock and delivered, but it's like being a kid waiting for Christmas again. I fully believe this is the future of VR gaming and will lead to further developments that will make VR more mainstream. I am extremely happy with my purchase, and highly recommend it!

Mixed feelings... won’t play with steam and you need to buy 3rd party streaming software to play games from pc.  It only plays “app” style games so if you Are wanting to steam you VR games you already own they will not work.  Even loading games you already own that can loaded onto the device requires the purchase of more 3rd party software.  It’s not very user friendly if you want to play games you have already bought and they oculus App Store doesn’t have a lot of quality games. Mainly B or C rated indie games. Also it does offer an almost open source web browser and fire fox but for an android based device not having a Google app in the store or available for download and having to download it though once again a 3rd party software is almost  laughable. It does have some great features like the tracking and not needing external sensors. The hardware is exactly what VR headsets need don’t get me wrong it’s great. they just need to focus more on software improvements. If it was compatible with mainstream gaming and didn’t require 2 different 3rd party software to stream and load it would have gotten 4 stars.

$400 is a lot of money for me. I bought it for 2 reasons - one is the health aspect and I have friends who are using it as their primary source for working out. The second and, equally important, reason I bought it is for meditation. When I heard there were meditation apps I was happy because I imagined meditating in all kinds of beautiful environments.I went to the Quest app store, only to find there are only 4 apps, ranging from $9.99 to $14.99. I tried one and liked it, but am disappointed in the limited selection. In fact, as I browsed the store, I was disappointed in the hefty prices for most apps. Free apps are limited...I only found16 in my search. After spending $400, I didn't count on having to spend so much on content.As for the headset, even with the eyeglass piece inserted, I found my lenses were not sitting in a way that gave me the sharpest viewing experience. (Just ordered new glasses, so this may be an issue just for me - we'll see.)So, overall, after the initial sticker shock, I see apps I would like to try but man, this is an expensive endeavor. After all of that expense, I expected a lot of free content and I am just not seeing it.Now I have learned there is another way to get apps called SideQuest, which means downloading APK files on the web, transfer them to the Oculus Quest, install them, then launch the app without using the Oculus Library. Ummm, ok.Additionally, I find the headset to be cumbersome and heavy. I used it sitting in bed for the meditation app, but still need to try it for active exercise. A lot to learn and figure out, but not sure this is something I can afford in the long run. Disappointing.

Being Oculus customer service is so horrible contcting them is useless a week and no reply, the unit I got died the first use, I have a temp reader and it read 115F. Now I am not technician at Oculus but that is not healthy for anything to have near the eye. I was trying to setup the unit it was on 15min but would not finish the setup, I thought it was hot in my house and took the headset off to amazingly hot, over hot Crap its hot unit.  Oculus has zero support so boxed the piece of junk and sent it back, if you have similar issues. Return it, these are not safe if they can get that hot.Hard to rate anything else since it was defective and nearly burned to the touch.Just found out its not compatble with Steam?? Wow.Oculus Seller, please do not comment to contact you as you do not help, only send generic answers forcing a return. So unless you are going to send me a free unit for my trouble, I wont be using Oculus products again, the GO over heated and so does the Quest.

Cant wait to play Arizona sunshine and death lap! Facebook horizon looks good to! After i purchased my Quest a week later my brother got one! If you see any complaints its usually gamers who have a gaming pc and have known about vr and have a certain standard. Or people looking at quest as underpowered and little content. Well its BRAND NEW and is gonna be walking before it sprints! I can tell you the content comes quickly! Had only a handfull of games and now the library will be hit with great games in december we are seeing many! So. If you want to experience wireless VR games. And dont have a PC, or just want it wireless. Its the Headset/console to get. Plus it has LINK so you can plug into PC at any time if you have it. Join us Questers! And know the popular VR gameplay you have been Binge watching on youtube! We have a very active facebook group just look up ARNOOKIE and other Oculus quest community-based pages! This is Cody blaze K. if anyone from our group recognizes throw a thumbs up so the new people can see! Can't wait for the new comers that we need to make our VR games great!

Really wanted to like the quest. So many glowing reviews. The convenience compared to prior generation VR setups is game-changing.But they quest couldn't figure out where my floor was, so I had to put big QR codes all over the room with masking tape so the quest could ""see"" my floor. Ugh.And then, great, tracking seems to work, ish. What games does it come with? None? Wait, what? Ugh.Well, let's look into my oculus account and download my prior purchased games...Wait, *none* of my purchases work on the quest? I have to buy everything all over again? Ugh.Let's try the space pirate trainer demo. Ok, neat, but lag spikes make for nausea. And I can't put my hands behind or below me, as my controller disappears.

I have both  - original rift and quest. So I'm comparing it to the rift only.Cons:1. Quest is very uncomfortable, it's impossible to wear it for more than 30 min, it's heavy and all the weight goes to your face! I do not have such problem with rift at all.2. VR sickness, it's much worse than with a rift. I don't know the reason, may be inaccurate tracking or low refresh rate 72Hz. Rift has 90Hz.3. Image quality, frankly I don't see any huge improvement over rift. Yes, it's better but not even x2 times better.4. Audio - garbage.Pros:1. Inside-out tracking, this is a pretty cool feature, but I doubt they will get a high precision tracking with it, it involves image recognition which is computationally expensive and inaccurate, unlike simple lighthouse tracking which used by vive and valve headsets. I know, it's portable but cmon, 99% of its users are using it in the same places.2. Oculus link, allows you to play games from SteamVR and Oculus Rift.I wish Carmack and his engineering team come up with better ergonomics, lighthouse tracking and minimum 90Hz refresh rate.

I bought the Rift S instead of this at launch day, preordered. I was on the fence between both units... I returned the rift S. It was terrible!!!! I waited to buy the Quest afterwards actually it was so bad. Until I heard about the Oculus Link technology and witnessed first hand ALVR running PC VR on a Quest.... Bought one, I love it, Best thing ever!!!!!  Adding hand tracking soon along with the Link make this a no brainer!  The Rift S is dead!  This becomes a Rift Q with a good USB 3.0 cable. or wireless with ALVR like I said. One pro tip I can give you all though. instead of connecting to your local wifi network. buy a good USB 3.0 wifi dongle. and then create a hotspot network in windows withit. Conect to your hotspot via the quest and make sure your PC is wired to your network instead of wireless. but that last part is not a big deal with this method actually. But doing this will remove any network latency or traffic from your wifi. Simply go into your hardware settings for your wifi card and manually set it to 40 mhz and to only use 802.11 a/n/c or any combo of those otherwise the hotspot will default to b/g mode which you don't want. If you do this you can play ALVR wireless PC VR no problem! It's literally amazing!!!!! don't listen to the other methods. do it this way.

Purchased for our daughter for Christmas 2019.  I thought since this was a Facebook company, the quality would be good.  My daughter likes the game.  Unfortunately, after five months of usage,  the right controller stopped working.  (my daughter does not play on the game everyday - the failure is not from excessive use).I googled support and found this issue has happened to quite a few people.  There are entire reddit threads dedicated to this issue.  We followed the suggestions and still could not get it to work.  We tried everything from changing batteries to resetting the device.Finally we contacted Oculus support and they opened a ticket. They said it appears we have tried all of the suggested repair protocols but with no luck.  They requested our purchase information and the serial numbers.  We have not heard from them since.  I would have expected better quality.  Buyer beware!

Well, it's like this...The Quest VR was amazing right up to the day it completely failed (26 days from the date of purchase) and upon research of the failure on the Oculus support site I found out that this exact issue (sudden loss of function of the home page, library, and store on the main control panel) has been a known issue since at least May and their suggestion to remedy the issue (simultaneously press the power button and volume control to reset the unit) killed the Quest. Luckily the failure happened prior to the expiration of return date and Amazon has ordered a replacement at no cost. The sad thing about my experience, even though I will receive a new unit, is that the failure issue has not been solved by Oculus.I can't express how ""awesome"" this technology is and how much I want my new quest to arrive, I just hope that the multibillion dollar organization that owns Oculus can fix this little bug.

I absolutely LOVED the original Oculus Rift, but the Quest and Rift S - I am not a fan. Those moments of presence in VR where you are jumping to return a tennis ball or quickly fire off an arrow: The tracking is often lost for a split second. It's not much, but enough to really make the experience less fun. Tracking also requires a ton of light to be effective. I'm so bummed that I was a proselytizing fan of Oculus, now I get angry every time I think about my experiences with Quest and Rift S.Doesn't require a PC to use, so that's something I guess ...

I’m a big gamer, and I had heard of VR technology but not experienced it until this past Christmas. My brother brought his Valve Index and gaming laptop to a family gathering and after 10 minutes in Blade & Sorcery I was hooked. The problem with other headsets like the Index is that they require expensive base stations and are wired to a gaming PC. Plus, the Valve is $1000. I did a lot of homework and settled on the Oculus Quest for $399 and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase.The Oculus Quest is a great ‘mid-range’ entry to VR and honestly in my opinion the best bang for your buck. The Oculus Quest is a completely wireless system. You put on the headset, turn it on, and are immediately thrown into setting up a guardian (play space) and playing immersive tutorials. It is intuitive and requires no other expensive hardware to enjoy the experience. This makes it very easy to share the experience with friends and family (low barrier of entry).The best part about the system? If you ARE a gaming enthusiast with a decent gaming rig, you can link your Oculus Quest to your gaming PC to play more graphics intensive games. You can do this through the new Oculus Link feature with a cable or even wirelessly with the Virtual Desktop app in the Oculus Quest App Store. The wireless setup takes a bit more hoops to jump through, but once setup it works fantastically. There are many tutorials online that explain how to do this.I can go to a family gathering and share Beat Saber with loved ones, but then come home, boot up my gaming rig, and play No Man’s Sky VR wirelessly in the office.This Oculus Quest really does offer the best of both worlds for the best price. Honestly, the 64Gb version is more than enough space. Don’t waste the extra $100. Most VR games are smaller in size and the more intensive games you will be running on a gaming rig anyways.One thing to note is that the Quest’s tutorials recommend kids be 13+ to play. This headset is an expensive piece of hardware that requires care. The Lens are easy to scratch if you don’t take care of them and the controllers won’t take a lot of abuse (punching walls, etc). Keep that in mind if you are looking to purchase the system for children.Also, the lens technology used can feel a tad ‘blurry’ when trying to read white text on a dark background. It results in a halo effect. From all of the research I have done online, all VR headsets are like this currently. It takes some getting used to.

The answer is yes and no, but mostly YES. The only downsides when compared to the PSVR is the refresh rate and the weight. But both of those cons are offset by what you gain. Namely the higher resolution and the quest being completely wireless. It is front heavy and you will feel the heft. It's not a dealbreaker but it's something you'll get used to. Adjust the straps properly and you'll be fine. The ease of use cannot be overstated. The setup for the unit and play area are easy as can be. The ""intro"" to get you used to the controls ran a bit long for me as I wanted to just get into the meat of the interface. The speakers on these are a revelation. So much so that I don't think I'll ever need to get ear/headphones. One less thing to put on my head!  As of this review, I do wish there were more games (something the PSVR has in spades for obviously being in the market longer), but what is there is enjoyable and worth owning the quest for. Another upgrade the quest has over the PSVR is the tracking. You don't need to face a camera and therefore tracking loss is kept to a minimum (if ever).  I love that it's completely portable so you can share the experience with friends and family outside of your home.Overall it's like a refined version of the PSVR but with a few tradeoffs to achieve the form factor and pricing.  I thought I was set with the PSVR, but I was really longing for that untethered VR experience. So glad I bought the Quest.

Edit, 12/28/20:I've had this device for nearly two years now and have a few more comments to make.  First, it's still a great first-gen standalone VR system, with the ability to play graphically-intensive games at a usually-decent frame-rate (expect frame-drops frequently, though).  I'm still rating this a solid 4 out of 5 stars.  It still has issues with smoothly running games with a stable frame-rate, with intermittent stuttering.  Honestly, it annoyed me enough to replace the system thrice (thanks, Oculus) to try and find a system that didn't stutter, but every one I've owned does to a degree.  Four ""defective"" devices in a row seems unlikely, so...I've finally come to accept it's just the limitations of the hardware, running all this stuff on a mobile VR system.  I wish that lightbulb had gone off sooner, as I feel kind of bad now for requesting replacements on something that isn't actually a bug, apparently.  So, keep in mind: If you want a lag-free mobile VR experience...sadly, it's still several years off, I think.Original review:I was lucky enough to receive my Quest on release day and immediately booted it up, having bought a ton of games earlier when the store opened.  Set-up was a breeze (only took about five minutes or so, maybe less), and then I was in First Steps.  Wow, what a cool experience!  I actually replay it on occasion (I love that you can do that!) because it's just so fun.  The controls were fairly intuitive and I find the experience of physically grabbing objects to be wonderful.  Coming from the Oculus Go, the 6 DOF for your two controllers is truly a game-changer.The addition of room-scale to VR is awesome!  I've only had Google Cardboard-like headsets and then the Go, so I had nothing to compare it to.  Wow.  Just...wow.  I play Super Hot daily and it still blows my mind that I can actually drop to the floor to dodge bullets and then roll behind cover!  I have started to use the Quest as an exercise device, with Beat Saber and Super Hot being my favorites (for a game where ""time only moves when you move"", Super Hot is a surprisingly intense workout).  I await the Quest 2 and will buy it day-one.So, for my glowing review, why four stars?  I'm not sure if my device is slightly defective or if I'm just sensitive to screen-tearing and stuttering, but I just can't ignore the stuttering that happens in (admittedly graphically-intense) games like Job Simulator and Drop Dead: Dual Strike.  For example, when loading up Office Worker in Job Sim, the environment lags a bit when moving around at times or when a lot of things are happening.  In Drop Dead, it's also present, to a noticeable degree.  Again, it in no way makes the Quest unusable, but I was immediately disappointed to spot flaws in my brand-new device.  Or is a certain amount of stuttering supposed to happen and expected?  I really don't know, as I've never played games this demanding on a stand-alone headset before.I don't know if it warrants a return or not.  Aside from the stuttering and glitches (my controllers lose tracking in Beat Saber with annoying frequency and reinserting the batteries doesn't fix it), the Quest is near-perfect and I have never had a gaming experience like it.  If I do return it, I'll buy another physically from a store, I think.  Just in case.

Being an early VR adopter and owning the CV1, I was scared of the graphical downgrade, and possibly worse tracking, on the Quest.But oooohhhhh boy, those are NOT a problem!The graphics may be worse but THE RESOLUTION IS AMAZING!  Almost NO GOD RAYS!  I can hardly block the tracking EVEN IF I TRY!  How on earth does it track me when I cover the cameras WITH MY HANDS?!  Amazing.  I mean, holding my hands over my head for a few seconds will cause it to lose tracking, but aside from that, I have never had, or at least noticed, a loss of tracking.  And it works just fine in dark rooms, after all.And you'd be amazed at how many games you can fit on the 64gb version.The only thing I don't like is that I can't seem to connect an external SSD to the device to watch movies...  No reason that shouldn't work.  Hopefully they add that feature soon, or else I might have to invest in a portable NAS.

Oculus done a great job making a VR headset wireless, but the titles and picture quality are just not good enough to support the price. I got mine on the release date and got bored playing it after a week or so. The reason is because there aren’t many good titles you can play. The most enjoyable title is beat saber, but i got bored after a while due to the lack of songs and it has tracking problem sometimes. The headset is quite heavy and it also freeze sometimes.

The Quest VR:it is awesome and as I learn more about it, I enjoy it more. Game library is still currently small, BUT as of writing this, this system is only a year past release, so it's still growing. 120+ at the moment. Plus SideQuest stuff.For a stand alone, it's great. A little pricey, but still a good investment. The haptic response (vibration) in controllers is a huge thing with me. One of my fave game, Real VR Fishing, really gets you into it and while I haven't caught that damn shark yet, it's time is coming as my skills improve.If you want to play Half Life Alyx, you need the the link cable. I think party link is the cheapest. (Gaming pc is needed for steam games) but this CAN act like a Rift if u have the PC. I don't, so haven't tried this aspect of it.The seller:While the shipping was quick, my issue was price. I paid little over $500 for mine, in the week before it arrived, he continued to raise price to nearly $650 on his remaining sets. Price gouging on electronics was ridiculous when the quarantine started and I wasn't buying for that reason. I had a 4 month jump on quarantine before everyone else, just cause of my situation.My advice, look for the best price. Don't pay more than $550 for this.

Oh My God. That's the first thing pretty much everyone says the first time they try the Oculus Quest. It's a truly amazing experience.I bought my Quest as a family Christmas present last year. Okay, let's just say I bought myself a present last December and called it a family present. :-)  It's Beat Saber's fault. I swear.I'm not going to talk about all the good things. There are tons of people doing YouTube videos that can tell you about that. I'm only going to give you a couple of warnings and maybe a suggestion or two.-Warning one: the battery life is good (about 2 hours), but if you and some friends/family are playing, you can readily burn through that. There are ways to resolve that, including external batteries. See the various YouTube videos that talk about accessories.-Warning two: limit play time (initially). This wasn't just me. Playing too long at first can give people motion sickness, even on games rated Gentle. Once you've had it for a while (not all that long), this goes away.I'm also going to recommend you watch some of the YouTube accessory videos and spend a little more money. I haven't done it yet, but I recommend face shield things that can be more easily cleaned. You might get a little sweaty, and the next person might be grossed out by your sweat. You'll probably want a travel case. i bought the one from Oculus.And get rechargeable batteries for the controllers. You'll otherwise go through a LOT. I went with Amazon Basics. I got a 4-port charger and 4 batteries, so I always have 2 charged batteries waiting for me. Now, ""a lot"" isn't daily. The controller batteries last 3-7 days. But that's ""a lot"" if you use normal, non-rechargeable batteries.Different people will like different games. My favorite remains Beat Saber. It gets my fat old body moving. The space pirate battle trainer thing is fun, as is Gun Club VR. My adult daughters like Moss. I think that's a cute game, too, but I struggle with some of the puzzles. I'm old and slow or something, I guess.If you're having family parties, I tried sharing to my Apple TV via my iPhone. That worked, sort of, but it tends to drop out, and there's serious lag. I bought a Chromecast, and that works much better. It's the only thing we use the Chromecast for. Being able to let other people see the game is fun.

First, I love the actual experience of using the headset.  The experience is so much better than I even imagined.  The games are a bit expensive, but so far worth the expense.  However, the speaker on the right side has failed already, and I keep the sound turned way down.  It failed after less than 4 hours worth of use.  I can still use headphones so I haven't returned it, but for this amount of money, it should have lasted longer.  I would still recommend it for the experience, but I am a bit disappointed in the quality of the equipment.

Raise your hands if you've read this book more than three times like me?Needless to say the concept of VR described in the book and our virtual reality reality were far apart: an octopus of cables and sensors hooked up to a required $1.5k computer which few of us had. In the end, you ended up broke looking like Neo in his battery pod powering The Matrix. So when Quest was announced I thought, eureka!! I pre ordered and for once I was the first kid with the Atari 2600 on my block. In a word, glorious. The second word is ""scary"". The freedom that having no wires provides makes it almost too easy to go down a rabbit hole and lose entire days just playing, messing around and avoiding daylight.Many reviewers have already rattled off the technical pros and cons. There are more pros than cons. Is it perfect? What in this life is?? My face hurts from having this heavy piece of plastic and glass hugging my face for several hours. The battery runs down too quickly  (about two hours) .

I really, truly, absolutely love this VR headset. It’s the first and only VR experience I’ve ever had, but it really is phenomenal. The only drawback is selection of games, and most games are more experiences than anything. That said, I love being able to invite friends over for their first VR experience and love to see their reactions to complete submersion.  Some really graphically impressive games have been released, and new and innovative tech and updates are constantly being added. This is, by far, the greatest gaming innovation since what I recall being a game stopper in my lifetime.  I’ve spent a bunch more $$$ in add-ons, including the HTC Vive headstrap, external battery pack, and a new face pad, and still this is a great deal. I’m so excited for newly released games and Oculus has simply been killing it with their support for this system. RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE!

[Edit] 10/21/2019I am going to up my rating to 4 stars. Oculus is doing a good job at listening to their Users. I wetn to https://oculus.uservoice.com/ and noticed others requesting the same. i also noticed they (Oculus) respond and show they are listening.If they do eventually go to a Multiple Profile OS I will bump it to 5 stars. This product is amazing outside of that. VR is amazing on this.(September 2019)I am not happy about this product but I do want to be fair with this review. So before I tell you why I gave this 2 stars let me say what is good about this product.The GoodThe VR is great. The device does a great job transporting you to a VR world with a great view and cozy fire place in the Menu Room. They selection of Apps is encouraging and I know the library is growing.I have had the PlaystationVR in the past and the tracking was so bad I got sick a lot. With the Quest I have had no issues with the tracking and my VR legs are getting strong.I also love the TV feature in the menu. This puts you in a comfy living room with a mountain view and a monster screen in front of you. From there you can watch ESPN and other TV Apps. It is nice if you want to watch something insulation from others. I just hope the selection of Streaming Apps does increase. Would love to see Youtube TV on this App.The Guardian System is really a brilliant idea. The headset has multiple I believe IR cameras and when you turn the system on it allows you to create a virtual wall to protect you from going too far in games and hurting yourself. if you go too far this virtual wall will appear in game warning you. And it seems to remember the room when you go back to the headset later.Now.... The Bad.Honestly it's just one thing and it is so big IMO I recommend holding off on purchasing this item until Oculus/Facebook address this issue.You can only have one User profile per device. If you want to let others in your house use it on their own profile you have to Factory Reset the device and start over. And!! That profile will have to buy the apps again if they want to play them. When you buy a game it is assigned to the profile not the device. This device was advertised as a Console VR system. This is not a console VR system. This is a personal device for one person by design.I bought this for my family and the way it is designed I would have to buy one for each member of my 7 member family..... Not a chance Facebook.This product has the chance to make VR popular. But not without the ability for multiple Profiles.

First, let me start by saying that I love the Quest experience and games.  This is really is a top notch VR experience.  So, why the 1 star?  I have a Netgear Orbi, and wifi drops every 10-20 minutes forcing me to manually re-connect.  If you google this issue, you'll see that many others who use a mesh type network have this same issue.  Furthermore, they have been aware of this issue since it's inception, and it still hasn't been fixed.What that means for me is that I have to avoid buying any games that require an internet connection.  It's also a pain when downloading games, and there's no way I can watch a movie or do anything else with it until/if this issue is fixed.  And like many others, forget about trying to get any support.  I put in a support ticket over a week ago, and haven't had a response (they say 2 business days).If it weren't for this issue, I would rate the Quest 4 stars.  It wouldn't be a 5, because the other issue I have is that I wanted this for the whole family, but it's only tied to one account.  So, it does not lend itself to multiple users/accounts for games, making this device pretty much just for me only.So, if you don't have a mesh wifi network, I would very much recommend the Quest.  If you do, buyer beware!!!

Whether you're new to VR or are a long time enthusiast, the Quest is an amazing piece of technology.Having experience with a friend's PSVR and HTC Vive, I thought the technology was very cool, but a pain to set up. I always wanted VR, but it's too expensive for someone like me, who doesn't already have a PS4 or powerful PC. I don't really have much time for tethered consoles anymore, so it doesn't make sense for me to invest so much in something I would rarely be able to enjoy. After spending two years with my Nintendo Switch, I can't go back to trying to find time for console gaming.The Oculus Quest has finally made portable 6dof roomscale VR a reality without feeling like it's compromised too much. While there's a noticeable downgrade in graphics, the freedom from wires and the ability to turn any room into a play space more than makes up for it not being as powerful. Thankfully, the resolution is really high. It's higher than PSVR, or the original Rift/Vive. This, and the freedom of movement and wireless game play make it feel more immersive than console/PC VR.The games available, at the moment, are ports of many games that were previously only available on PC/PS4. It's amazing how well they look and run on mobile hardware. The difference between the Quest and PSVR/Vive feels very similar to the difference between PS4 and Switch games. It's a compromise I'm happy to make for an all-in-one VR game system.The Touch controllers are smaller than the PC counterparts, but work amazingly well. Many VR games were built around these controls, and apart from the smaller size work just as well.The inside out tracking and guardian system work almost flawlessly providing 1:1 tracking and a safe play space. Set up takes a minute, tops, and doesn't need any sensors.As someone who works at a group home nearly 70 hours a week, my overnights are now a time of respite. I can keep an ear out for my clients while feeling like I'm somewhere else. This has had such a theraputic effect that it literally feels life changing. I love my Nintendo Switch. It's awesome to be able to play console quality games anywhere, but the Quest gives me a change of scenery. It is also very helpful for someone with a sedentary lifestyle. I'm moving my body more and it feels great.I would highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in VR. It has the power to convert even people who don't play videogames regularly. We're living in the future, and it's awesome! I feel like I have a portable holodeck that's not only fun, but theraputic. I highly recommend the Oculus Quest. This could be just the device that will take VR from a niche hobby to a mainstream fixture in entertainment.

Got this for our son for Christmas this year.  He absolutely loves it and hasn't put it down since he opened it. Well except for the 2 hour or so battery life. The charger that comes with it charges very slow. He decided to use his fast charger from his macbook air and it charges it way faster.  It came with all three episodes of the Darth Vader game.  I tried it and like it as well.  The graphics are not xbox 1 quality but they arent Atari quality either. I bought him a travel case for it as well. Once the headphones come back in stock I will get those because I think the surround sound will be way better.  I think I will rig a battery pack to make the gameplay last longer. I would recommend it.  He would recommend it as well. I'm going to get a few more. A downside is only one person can be registered to it. If you want to add another family member you will have to reset it to factory defaults and clear out the other person. This will erase all their progress and games. However, you can play their games on their account if they let you. So if you have more than one child or adult that wants it they will have to have their own. There also isnt any multi player games out right now. We also purchased a warranty with it.

Oculus Quest is the best way to experience VR. However, quality control issues will ruin your experience.Pros:No PC neededFun games like beat saberFun exercise games like supernaturalAdjustable PDOculus Link for PC VR games too!Cons:Very Poor quality control ruins everythingThe oculus quest is the VR headset to get after the launch Oculus Link... not only can you play PC free, you can also play PC VR games like half life alyx on the quest - it even works with the USB cable out of the box! However poor quality control ruined my experience. Right out of the box I noticed a lot of glare. while ""god rays"" are expected due to the way the lenses work, what I was seeing was from the inside of the right lens being cloudy. The effect is like wearing glasses that you smeared your finger oil all over.Until QC can be improved, I cannot recommend the quest.

I have both a Vive, and a Vive Pro with an Nvidia 1080x graphics card.  This is better than that.  It looks better, it plays better, there are no cables, and it is VERY portable.  No perceptible god rays.  No perceptible screen door effect.  I do not notice the difference in refresh rate whatsoever.  Maybe it's there? but the experience is so vastly improved by the lack of cables and the fact that I can use this anywhere that I do not notice it.  I should note that I had an Oculus dev kit2 and a Samsung Gear VR, so I've been at this for awhile.  I know the difference between good and bad VR.  This is VERY good VR.  I paid $800 for my Vive, and over $3000 for the computer I run it on 2 years ago.  This miracle cost me $400.  I can't see why I'd need a 128G version.  Do yourself a favor if you like cool stuff that works awesome.  Love the controllers too.  I got one of those silicone covers for the headset and controllers too.  Good investment!  I use this for working out (Beat Sabre, Box VR, Thrill of the fight)  I have all of these games on Steam VR and they are much more enjoyable to play on the Quest.

This product shows free returns for the Amazon return policy. I guess I needed to read every tiny detail because they charged me back $124 as a restocking fee. obviously it does not cost them that much. I ask if they would just apply that charge to the occulus ghost but they would not cooperate. The hand devices were heavy for my small hands and or not easy to use, especially if you have a little bit of arthritis in your hands.

This is a different kind of review meant for people who could only choose between an Oculus or traditional (PS5, XBox). I had to choose between the two and I opted for the Oculus; it's a decision I regret painfully. It isn't that this is a bad system. We all know that the speed and graphics couldn't compete with the traditional model gaming, but I was willing to sacrifice that for a full-immersion experience. And, ironically, that's why I regret it. The Oculus is just ""too much"" for me in every way. It's too long to get up and running, it's too slow, but most of all, it's too immersive. I like my gaming experience to be fun and casual. I like to hit pause easily and grab a snack, look out the window, or check my phone. It gets exhausting to put on the headset, check the batteries, check your radius of play, adjust the headset, wait minutes to navigate and load your game, and then have to wonder what you're missing on the outside world. The first hour of having this was awesome. Since then, I just don't find it worth the time to play. My advice? Go with PS4, PS5 or the XBOX. It's just easier and more fun.

This is my first time using a VR, the Quest is VERY uncomfortable to wear on my face. It's a heavy device so I don't recommend playing on it for too long as it will leave red marks on your forehead and cheeks (honestly it feels like it tugs at my skin). That aside, the games on it are $10-30 bucks so if you don't plan on spending anymore after you get the VR Quest you're out of luck here unless you connect it to a free game on a computer. The setup on the computer took a while especially since it did not come with a USB-C cord;  low-grade ones will not work so don't even try.After buying an appropriate USB-C cord for the VR Quest, it finally connected to the computer so I could play online games. As for the console games, I played the demo games and all were fun especially BeatSaber which I ended up purchasing with my VR. The battery life lasts two hours at most and then it needs to be charged.  All in all, love the experience--I don't think it's worth $500 even as a novelty item---definitely not. The uncomfortability wearing it is huge for being on your face even for 5 minutes.4.5 stars for the experience. Would be 5 if it wasn't so uncomfortable to wear and expensive for what it's not worth. Will update later if I have anything else to add.::JUNE UPDATE:: The controllers become disconnected often on fullbattery. This has nothing to do with connectivity as I connect my Oculus to the bluetooth? (which I didn't even need to do before..) Sometimes I play and my hand just disappears on screen, or worse, both of them do. Strange since I didn't even own it for a year and I take very good care of this thing.

I've only been using it a few hours, so I might amend this later to give an updated review. However, it's a lot of fun, and I like it a lot. The price is right..The good:it is easy to setup and go. ( I had an initial problem with the left controller connecting, but unpair it and repair it worked fine after)you don't need a pc. just a android or apple phone..Good selection of games to use.Graphics are great.the headset is surprisingly comfortable, you get used to it. It's just a matter of getting the right adjustment.The neutral:Even though you're not tethered to a pc, You still need a fair amount of space to use this.  Most of the games recommend a 61/2 by 61/2 foot guardian space to safely play.  I'd would say based on a person's  height  that the space be at least a foot or more beyond a person's hands if they were to stretch their arms out, like making human letter T, in any direction.  A person 6'2"" would need more space than me at 5'7"" for safe game play.The bad..so far I haven't really run into huge negatives. that bother me a lot.Battery life is shorter than I would hope for, about 2 hours.Makes me wish I had a full blown star trek holodeck.I recommend this, totally work the purchase.

Original Quest would not charge either to a defective battery or cable. Requested replacement and Amazon shipped me a new set before I even returned the defective set. Bravo to Amazon.The Oculus Quest is unbelievable and one has to see it to believe it. You can’t believe the technology!Fabulous product and highly recommended!!!!Having had this product for 3 months, I am downgrading my rating from 5 stars to 1 star. I have just received my second replacement of the Oculus Quest. The Oculus Quest has suddenly stopped charging on my first 2 units. Secondly, virtually everyone who owns the Oculus can’t cast the image from the headset to your iPhone as it is supposed to do.To make matters worse, there support system is horrible and there’s no phone number available for one to speak to a human about a technical problem.My opinion is that Oculus Quest was prematurely released with multiple bugs in the system. It needed months of work by R & D before it was released. Wouldn’t recommend buying until Oculus gets their act together and eliminates the bugs and develop a functional support system, which includes a phone number so someone with a problem can speak to another person.

When I first received my headset, it was everything I could've expected: good graphics, responsive, immersive, etc. But now that I've had it for a month or two, I'm no longer satisfied.I mainly bought my headset to play VRchat. In this game, I was looking forward to being able to experience all different types of avatars and people. However, I can see almost no avatars in this game, and the headset overall is very glitchy.I have experienced many different glitches while using my Oculus Quest. The first glitch I ever encountered was that while playing VRchat, the game would either freeze and send me to my home room (in-game) or would just close itself. Then, I started having the issue of a complete black screen. People in-game could still hear and see me, and I could still hear them. But all I could see was a black screen. My biggest glitch so far is currently happening right now. When I try to turn on my headset, it acts as if it is brand new, automatically putting me into the ""First Steps"" simulation. When I get through it, I am put into my home, where I can see the space around me, but I cannot see my home screen. I can see my menu bar at the bottom, but any screen I try to view simply isn't there. When I try to manually access VRchat or any other game from the Oculus app on my iPad, the whole game crashes in the headset and ultimately puts me back into my home space without my home screen. I would not recommend this headset to anyone and I fully regret buying it.

If you're looking to get into VR (and you can look past the fact that Facebook owns Oculus), this is the headset to get. Being wire + PC free and still able to play really fun games is amazing. Beat Saber and other games are great workouts too!Pros:- Library is growing rapidly / Fun games- Most games are <= $25, All are $30 max- Game Refund policy- Developers listen and patch often- My 95 yr old Grandma thought it was cool- Guardian system- Sound is surprisingly good from headset- Easy to use the Store- Can play while you charge- FB is constantly updating and adding features like Oculus Link, hand tracking, etcCons:- 72 Hz refresh rate on lenses can make you sick on rail movement type games. Not as great as higher end sets obviously.- Casting drops often, even on 5Ghz- Facebook owns Oculus / What are they doing with the data?- Must use FB account to sign in for Social features (friends list, etc)- Foam facepad soaks up and holds sweat (get the VR facepad 3rd party accessory)

First, the Oculus Quest is great.  Being untethered is the best way to experience VR.I've only played PSVR for comparison, and the Oculus is a technically superior experience in every way.  The tracking and motion controllers are more accurate and better designed, and the Guardian system is fantastic.  The only problem is that the headset itself is not nearly as physically comfortable an experience.  It takes much fiddling to get the fit and feel right, and even then, it's not what it should be.I feel that when you pay this much for an item that is otherwise well-made, comfort shouldn't be such an issue that you end up buying additional accessories to jury-rig your headset.  They could have put more thought into the weight distribution, and it feels like they just phoned-in the strap design.  Additionally, you're going to get sweat and oils from your skin on the face mask, and while the material of the Oculus is nice, it just absorbs all that grodiness.So far, I've purchased silicone mask covers for easy cleaning and materials to make a counterweight for the back of the strap.  It has helped, but it's not ideal.  I may try one of the padded strap rigs down the road, but I don't really want to spend the money for more accessories that may or may not help.  If you want an affordable counterweight example, I bought a small pouch of diving shot and used velcro loops to secure it to the strap.

I used to own an Oculus Rift (OG retail) and sold it for a few reasons:1) The screen door effect was awful2) Setting up all of the sensors each time I wanted to use it was a massive choreThe Quest somewhat solves the first one and completely solves the second one. The Quest has a much higher resolution, and ""inside out"" tracking, which means no external sensors. I've read in reviews that people had better results with the external sensors, I completely disagree. I have WAY better results tracking the headset and the controllers with the ""inside out"" tracking on the Quest.A complaint I heard is that the Quest is heavy, I don't think it is at all. Another complaint is the loss of headphones using speakers instead, but I prefer this because if something happens in the ""real world"" (doorbell, etc) I'm not unresponsive and lost in the game.The new hand tracking (in beta) absolutely blew my mind, it's so cool and has a ton of potential for future games once it's refined.Being able to use the Quest as both standalone and as a Rift using the Link makes it more versatile. I've noticed that I need to be plugged into a USB 3.1 ""Gen 2"" port in order for the signal to stay reliable. The standard USB 3.0 (aka 3.1 gen 1) ports seem to cut out or have trouble connecting.To me the Quest is a massive leap forward, but there's still the nagging issue of putting a 1440p screen, a low resolution by modern standards, a millimeter from your eyeball. It does not have the razor sharp precision we're getting used to with 4K screens at a reasonable difference. Until we can get 4K or better yet 8K per eyeball, VR is not able to replicate the pixel fidelity of a console/PC game. That is a long way away, but the Quest proves innovation in other important areas are making the architecture of this technical far more accessible.

This works fine I guess, it's great that they can be used wirelessly or wired like a more traditional HMD. The question I have is more about the future of VR as a whole. The games for this thing are actually pretty terrible, so many stupid games where you stand in place and shoot things, or maybe you're on rails. The medium feels strangled by people refusing to accept any game that isn't 1st person when having games playable in 3D could be promising and make for a larger variety. The battery life hasn't been an issue since I usually get bored of the ""experiences"" long before they have time to run out. The interface is a bit annoying to navigate and it just feels like there's very little to do on it right now. VR as a whole is still hoping you'll be amazed by the ability to control things rather than having control just be part of what makes the game amazing. Hopefully in the future there will be cheaper headsets with less restrictions on what uses they have.

Packaging :High quality. Everything is neat and pretty. Sounds funny, but this is the best nylon wrapping I have seen in my life.You feel this is a premium product when you unbox it.Usage and comfort:This is actually a lot of fun, the tracking is perfect, and some games are really fun. I think this is the first VR device that isn't a niche product - VR for the mass.The real issue with it is, as you can expect, the weight.  This thing is heavy and will hurt your face.  Sometimes you play with the straps and get to a sweet spot.. but mostly it will not be comfortable.  I still play, but I get really red marks on my face afterwards.Sound:Not as bad as people say, absolutely playable. But...one you try it with earphones , that's a one way ticket.Screen:Well.. although this is a high res OLED screen(s), this resolution is just not enough.  It's  OK and you will still have fun, and it will be immersive.. but the resolution is just not high enough at this stage.  It's all pixels (doesn't matter if you use Link or not - the resolution isn't there). You get used to it, but don't expect anything nearly close to what you see on a computer screen - maybe in 3-5 years or so.What I am bothered with is the significant amount of users with Dead Pixels out of the box.  Yes, I have them too.  Around 3 green pixels which never change.  Luckily they are not in the center so I kinda got used to ignore them.  Just a thing to keep in mind if you are a pixel peeper. Get it in a place which will let you replace it if you do get dead pixels.  BTW, google  it, there are a lot of users with the same issue.Prices:Games are generally too expensive for what you get.  No way around it.  The price of a simple VR game is usally around $30. You do get an option to ask for a full refund if haven't played it for more than 2 hours.I'm not sure I can recommend games here as Amazon might not approve this review if I do so..I won't.Conclusion:Really cool device - totally fun.Just be sure to know that you might get dead pixels , the resolution is much lower than what you would expect form a 2020 gaming device, and it is very front heavy.Are there any wireless alternatives to the Quest?  Not at this time.

I purchased this device in July and spent a month trying to get it working, buying every suggested cable and card. I was able to get it working, using advice from other users because the tech support was over run and seemed to be giving marginally useful advice from a pre-set script.Following instructions, I bought the 80 dollar official cable that didn't work, and bought a special card to work with the cable that didn't work, and then bought another cable and some adapters and a splitter, I ended up returning all of that crap and buying a simple Anker USB 3.0, you'll see it referenced in other reviews I'm sure.Now with a working VR kit, I play for a month and all is fine. Except now Facebook has decided it wants to rebrand the Oculus name and take ownership, with a lot of software updates and drivers on desktop and inside the VR headset, all pointing you in the direction of logging in to and then using Facebook on VR. Which is fine and dandy, if it worked at all. Trying to play games leads to random disconnects from the computer, random lockups and freezes in the apps. Lots of other Oculus Quest users reporting similar issues, and no fixes.If you think this is a good deal, just be careful. If it gives you the slightest issue, don't trust the process, get your money back  otherwise you'll be trying to get technical service up to and beyond the time you can return it, and that suits Amazon just fine.

This headset is an amazing platform. Its inside out tracking works very well and the image quality is high. I love that you can choose to see the real world if you want and the room scale guardian makes me feel safe to not worry about my surroundings. And I love that it will remember your play area between uses. This is the first vr headset I have tried that makes me believe the platform is viable. And it accommodates my large IPD.The cons:- the headset is new so its library of apps is small- many of the apps are the same as other platform's just with bigger price tags- it's not yet compatible with the go library (but oculus claims it will)- its heavier then the go but the extra features make it worth it- there is no brightness adjustment so expect the rays of god. If you are technologically inclined you can side load an app to turn on blue light filtering which will help- the battery is a little small but I get why. The headset does not need more weight. Just plug in when using stationary apps

This is my first VR headset, and frankly, it’s my first meaningful VR experience. I really like it overall. I’m impressed with the amount of content available and was pleased to learn that many of the Oculus entertainment apps (Netflix, Venues, Sling, etc.) are available for the Quest. The headset is comfortable overall, but it needs to be positioned pretty precisely or the images are a tad blurry.I think there’s definitely some room for improvement on battery life and the quality / clarity of the screen. I understand that they couldn’t necessarily offer top-of-the-line hardware at this price point, but I expected a little better in both regards. They do provide a very long power cord, but being tethered to a power cord defeats the purpose of a cordless headset.

We got this because my son really wanted Beat Saber.  He loves video games and he can be plenty physically active if we're doing something he likes, but he's not into playing sports.  I wanted him to get more exercise.  He now plays Beat Saber pretty much every day.  He gets a great workout and always has to shower after 'cause he gets so sweaty!  He's told me about so many things in his health and mental state that have improved since he began exercising daily with this game.  It's really amazing.  As far as the system itself, it is very impressive.  So simple to use and setup.  He can take it anywhere, setup his perimeters, and begin playing right away.  The only downside is the face cover gets really saturated with sweat if you're playing an active game.  We ended up buying a couple extra covers that are probably vinyl and don't absorb sweat. Those were a good addition.  All the games are remarkably small compared to what I was expecting.  The 64 GB size has been plenty.

I'm surprised how much I actually like this VR headset!I bought this primarily for gaming and was a little hesitant because at the time of purchase there weren't that many titles that appealed to me (i like FPS type games), and this made the price seem high just to play some VR games (been to several VR game centers in Tokyo so love VR).  However, after getting the headset i realized, OMG, there is much more to the headset than just gaming!  Regarding the limited number of appealing titles, quite a few new games are added frequently.WHAT I LIKEMany Amazon Prime shows and movies can be watched (not all tho), as well as YouTube and Netflix (if you have a subscription).  What's especially cool about watching movies with the headset is it's like being in a large, plush movie theater with a huge screen in front of you!  You look around and see a dimly lit theater, but, once the movie gets underway, the virtual room goes dark with just a large screen in front of you.With the ability to orient the view, I can lay on the sofa or in bed and watch movies or TV programs.  This means watching movies and TV programs is no longer limited to which room the TV is located in!I'm enjoying the Boxing VR workout sessions.  There are a variety of workouts to chose from, and I can do them anytime in the comfort and privacy of my own home.  For the most part, I like the accompanying music selections and the different gym types add the experience.  The workout sessions do give me quite a workout!I didn't expect to have my own virtual home whenever I'm wearing the headset, and the homes are quite impressive.  Some of the views are Sooo impressive and/or relaxing, I feel like getting a beverage, sitting back and just enjoying the view!My fav game so far is Pistol Whip.  It's like being John Wick!  This is an exciting, fast-paced game, which is a workout in itself!You can have the best of 2 worlds; Quest and Rift.  The Quest is an untethered device with the option to tether and have access to Rift games.Since the headset is self-contained and not tethered to a PC, it can be taken anywhere you go for gaming, TV, movies, workouts, etc.WHAT I DON'T LIKEThe headset has some weight to it, so after a while you start to feel the weight.  I've read Facebook will produce in the future a lighter weight headset.The games aren't cheap!  I purchased a couple of titles ""right off the bat"", and I regretted it.  I recommend before purchasing a game, checkout the reviews and watch previews on YouTube to have a good idea if it's something you'll enjoy.

I had never peeked inside a VR headset before buying this sight unseen.  I had read a lot of negative reviews of VR over the years, so I wasn't expecting much.  This probably contributed to my ""holy s***"" reaction to my first 5 minutes going through the First Steps tutorial.  The Quest VR is really a new kind of human experience.  I was truly blown away by home convincing the VR effect is.Now that I've had about 10 days with it, I thought I'd write a review.  The ""omfg, wow"" factor has worn off a little bit, but this is still a remarkable technology that really does transport you into a different realm for a short time.  I have picked it up every day I've had it, and so has everyone else in my family.There are some imperfections.  There is sometimes some glare in the lenses, or other optical deficiencies that detract from the experience.  But for the most part, it is an amazing effect.  ""Running around"" by using the controllers makes me motion sick in less than a minute.  I can't do that, so that limits the things I'm able to do a little bit.  But there's still plenty to do that feels very comfortable.  The Beat Saber game is a nice meditation.  The ""Thrill of the Fight"" game is a surprisingly good workout that has me huffing and puffing in no time.  There isn't a huge library of games, but there's enough good quality stuff right now to tide me over until the library expands, which I'm sure it will.Is it worth $400?  I would say it is.  There's more tech here than in a quality mobile phone that costs $400 and up.  It's a worthy addition as a ""game console"" in the same price range.If you've been waiting for VR to ""make sense"" in terms of price and performance and experience, the time is now.

Most reviews that have anything bad to say about the Quest say that it's not as good as HTC or Rift. Well, I say the Quest is amazing and they should shut their rich mouths. Not everyone can afford a massive gaming rig to run those headsets. The Quest has given me the opportunity to experience VR, which is something I've dreamed of doing since I was 5 (and I'm old)! The video quality is adequate, the sound is incredible, and the immersion is a religious experience. My only complaints are that it's a bit front-heavy after a while, and the battery lasts about 2-3 hours of constant gameplay. Neither of those issues make me regret my purchase. Once I get some more money saved up, I'm going to buy another one so my wife and I can both play together! Thanks for this incredible experience, Oculus! I look forward to upcoming games and accessories.

This is my first VR rig (if you don't count Google Cardboard) and it is unbelievably good. I wanted to try VR and just the set up and ""first look"" app experience was enough to justify the price to me. I'm very excited to see where VR will go. I'm not a gamer, so I need more exploratory apps. I love Mission: ISS that lets me explore the space station - I feel like I'm there. Wander gives me Google Street View in 360, but the interface is a bit clunky. I wish there was Google Earth. I bought Sports Scramble and played it with a friend who lives 400 miles away. It was fun for a few days but now seems repetitive and gimmicky. First Flight was interesting for a couple of hours, then got boring for lack of new experiences. VR in Virtual Reality was interesting. I played through, but got tired of it towards the end. I've tried some of the chat room apps, but they seem populated with screaming and badly behaving 13 year olds. Rec Room has some interesting stuff, but is not intuitive to use and I do not want to watch a bunch of YouTube videos to figure out how to change the color of my ""dorm room"".UPDATE: I wanted to watch an Amazon Prime movie but found it was locked for ""parental controls"". But there are no parental controls in the Oculus. Turns out the only way to watch all the Prime content in the Amazon Prime app is to disable the ""purchase pin"" on your Amazon account. Now you can watch movies, but you are exposed to people buying digital goods on your account. Seems like Amazon should have spent less time on making their VR app cool and more time thinking through the mechanics of watching Prime - which is the main point.

I just got this as my first VR set after researching the many options and I am so glad I chose the Quest.  I was completely amazed by VR when I first used the set.  It is very simple to set up and with the side and top of head straps, can fit any size/shape head.  The eye glasses insert also fits extremely wide glasses, so if you wear them, it is likely to fit yours without issue.  Pixelation is also not a huge issue, the graphics are clean and crisp.  Always make sure to play in a well lit room as the tracking can struggle in a dark or dimly lit room.The biggest issue with the Quest is its game and app library.  The system is fully capable of playing the Rift games, but they just aren't available yet.  You also cannot use Steam VR.  The exception to this is when you plug your Quest into a PC,  you can play the Rift and Steam library, but this defeats the purpose of having a standalone, portable set.  Beat Saber is also lacking the extensive library of custom music/map downloads and mods, but you can get around this by sideloading them onto it, using Sidequest (you can google some great guides on how to do this).The Quest is also missing many of the streaming services apps.  It includes YouTube VR and Netflix, but lacks Hulu, Disney+, HBO, and others.  You can use the web browser to watch from these companies however and there is also an inexpensive Virtual Desktop app so that you can stream movies and music from your PC.

After having both first and second gen head sets I can safely say this is a game changer.  I played this thing in one night more that I did with the two other headsets combined - Why?  Because it's wireless. It has no base stations, has a huge (25X25) possibly playing area.  Yes you take a hit in the graphics, these are snapdragon processors and not Radeon Vegas and nVida RTXs, but trust me - the wirelessness more than makes up for it.  This will drive more VR specific hardware in the the near future. PLUS you can stream SteamVR games with almost no latency  - That is there SOME latency, but very minimal.  I've also started using it to replace my steady state and HIIT cardio work outs with PistolWhip (Using Deadeye and real gun handling) which is a hell of a work out, and BoxingVR and Thrill of the Fight are a hell of a workout too.  I'm able to get my heart rate peak in the 150s after about 20 minutes of good playing with weights on ankles, wrists, and a vest and that is no mean feat as I'm already pretty much an athlete already and it takes quite a bit to get my HR up that high and stay there.I really can't stress how much fun this thing is.  I play it every day now as part of my workout... a hell of a lot more fun than going out to jog or do HIIT.

I have been a fan of VR since trying it in 1992, and always dreamt that one day it would be possible to affordably have it at home.  After owning the PlayStation VR for more than a year, I thought that it was great to have, but still had some limitations about setup, wires, and freedom of movement.Enter the Oculus Quest!  Despite having less graphical power than it's PC or PSVR counterparts, it's relatively low cost and utter portability take VR into a whole new generation.  And Oculus seems to be continually updating and improving it with free updates that add significant new features, like hand tracking without a controller, and the ability to tether to a PC for the full PCVR experience!  This is honestly my favorite bit of tech that I've ever owned, and I would recommend this to anyone that is interested in Virtual Reality but was put off by the cost and technical hoops.  This is your entry point!

Dislike:The Oculus Quest library is pretty solid but the Quest versions of popular games, such as Beat Saber, are way behind the PC versions in terms of customization options and user-generated content. I am also kind of dubious of how closed the Quest system is and signs Oculus is more aggressively trying to monetize their store compared to Steam.Like:You can use the headset without a PC.This is great for stuff like YouTube watching, Tilt Brush, and many other apps where the Oculus Quest version is just as fleshed out as PC versions.This is a bargain at $400 retailLOVE:Wireless Virtual Desktop to run PC VR gamesYou can run Virtual Desktop to play PC VR titles wirelessly via wifi. Yes, there is noticeable input lag when things get intense but for most players and in most titles, it's not a problem at all.The wireless experience is so good and liberating my wife and I have mostly left the Valve Index to collect dust and play PC VR games via Virtual Desktop.

No video I saw did it justice you have to try it for yourself.ConsSweating and then sharing. Depending on what you play you will sweat so playing with friends is kind of nasty.Grab buttons are very sensitive. It will take a few days to get 100% comfortable with that controller. It’s different And there’s no glancing down to see where the buttons are obviously.Also having to adjust it on your face to have it properly sit for the clearest image is a little clumsy That again speaks to sharing it because once you get it perfectly set you really don’t wanna have to readjust it.Most games are very short. It does not mean bad But $10 for an hour or so ep of Vader??? Ok!  Because it was great and if I ever lose my mind I will tell stories about the time i met Darth Vader In person. The games are getting longer and better I so it definitely has a future. Those are gripes because all in all I highly recommend if you’re interested you’ll probably be amazed.

I've been excited about VR since the original Oculus rift was announced years ago. I've been to multiple ""try VR"" experiences including The Void. I've tried friends headsets and tested the waters with mobile Daydream VR.  The problem is that I'm a casual gamer and have refused thusfar to buy a high end gaming rig to play VR. The Oculus Quest is finally what I've been waiting for!This device has been a blast from day 1. Even my spouse has been blown away by Beat Saber. The quality is a slight downgrade over higher end units but I promise you that you won't miss it. The immersion is second to none and VR without cords is a dream come true.I cannot say enough good things about this unit but will try and be realistic. The fit and comfort of the unit is decent and isn't a problem for extended sessions with it seated properly. Definitely leaves marks on my cheeks though. There is a significant gap around the nose which bleeds some light. This was an initial concern of mine but after real use I've come to appreciate being able to quickly peek through this hole back to reality and it also helps with airflow. I get very hot and sweaty when swinging a lightsaber. The adjusting straps are simple and Intuitive enough for my less than tech savvy wife to pick up immediately.The catalog of games is excellent so far. I have ever been more immersed than when I stepped into the world of Vader Immortal. This VR headset has ruined all other forms of gaming for me. My Switch and Xbox are now collecting dust.Excellent replayability and so easy to hop in for a quick 20-30 minute session. The ability to avoid external sensors is truly a game changer.I am not one to trust Facebook but they absolutely killed this one. If youre interested in VR, then you should buy this. It's that simple.

O.M.G! This is the neatest think since...well, I don’t know what!I purchased this set after trying it out at my Sister’s place a couple of weeks ago. I tried Beat Saber, Box VR and Sports Scramble and heaven help me, I was beyond hooked! I’d just started a diet and exercise regimen and was handling the diet part, but not so much the exercise. My Quest has changed all that.As this is my first VR, I don’t have anything to really compare it with, but I LOVE this system! To me (again, I’m a VR noob), the immersion is simply amazing. There is a “getting started” app already built in, and it REALLY helped me get acquainted with how the controllers work. Plus dancing with that adorable robot had me at the hello wave. 🥰Because I purchased primarily for the calorie burn apps, I haven’t tried any shoot ‘em up games, yet. This does EXACTLY what I purchased it for; it gets me off my lazy keister and exercising! My Apple Watch calories burned have been pretty much off the charts since I started using this, so mission accomplished. Had zero idea that getting my heart rate up would be so much fun!

Mine sadly arrived with a dead pixel in the right eye but thankfully it's impossible to see it during game-play and it only prevalent when turning the machine on or off or i'm in a pitch black environment.I was originally going to buy the Vive and had bought tons of PC VR games ahead of time in anticipation, then I heard that this headset could play PC VR games wirelessly and a wired option for PC VR would come out soon. So I took the risk and pre-ordered it.While there are a few compromises, it works FAR better than I could have hoped. fair warning ALVR may be free but it's kinda crap, bite the bullet and buy Virtual Desktop and then sideload it. the quality is better, fewer crashes and much less compression issues. (If you have good internet, don't waste your money on the link cable, the quality is very similar to Virtual Desktop.)The Quest store didn't have a lot when this headset first released but the quantity of great games now is very respectable.I tend to play Beat Saber and Recroom on the go and play Skyrim VR and Saints and Sinners in my home space.I'm so glad I spent 450 for this instead of 1000 for a Vive and wireless setup or even an Index I can only play in my house.

The quest is unexpectedly more immersive than I anticipated. After reading that they're using a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 I thought that well it's a first gen thing. Surely they can use a better chip in succeeding generations. I can wait for it. What changed my mind is the recent update that allows for a link cable to connect to the PC. essentially converting this unit from a stand alone VR to an optional PC VR unit.  That meant that even if the hardware is replaced, I could still find a use for the headset as a backup PC VR Rig. Since I'm purchasing it in this time frame, Vader Immortal comes bundled with the quest. While there is a number of expensive apps you could buy, there are also a number of free apps you can get. Rec Room, Altspace, bait and a few others. Connecting online also gives you the option to play online VR games. There's easy access to these sites on the quest and I haven't had any trouble playing them. Watching video you can see the screen door effect but I still enjoyed watching futurama on Prime VR and found streaming video from my PC to be simple. I found myself breathless in some of the games which is what I wanted. A means to trick my body into some light exercise while having fun. Motion sickness is a problem when moving without teleporting. I had assumed it would be no different from looking at a monitor and moving with keyboard and mouse but the immersion factor does something weird and its easy to get disoriented. My advice is to keep your turns small and slow and take breaks. Over all I've had a lot of fun with it the first day and look forward to the tech improvements of the future.

I'm having so much fun with the Oculus Quest and I'm glad I got it when I did as it's not available for the foreseeable future.  My main reason for pulling the trigger was for Half-Life: Alyx.  With the Oculus Link cable I'm able to connect to my PC (yes, a wireless headset now as a wire) and get way more games to play albeit with a wire.  You get access to Oculus Rift games AND steam VR games.  A lot of the time I'll check to see if steam has the same game that Oculus Quest is selling so that I can just get it during a steam sale  for dirt cheap.  Yes, once again you'll be playing with a wire but you'll be able to get a buttload more games to play. It's very much well worth it.  I've yet to try side loading apps and streaming the PC games to my headset to avoid having to use a wire but it's definitely an option.Aside from gaming, there's other cool apps you can use. I connect to my PLEX server and watch movies, there's a sports app that lets you watch highlights as if you were on the floor with the athletes (very cool), Amazon has their own VR videos, Google Maps street view is so much fun to visit places around the world like the Vatican, Stonehenge, etc.It's a really awesome product and I just went with the smaller 64GB version because the games aren't really that big to begin with (1-3GB) and the PC games are playing off of your PC.  Mine came with Vader Immortal and it definiely blows everyone's mind when they try it. Get it right meow!

I had never used any type of VR before purchasing the Oculus Quest so I had no idea of what to expect.  I am not really impressed by electronics and am disappointed quite often so I was a bit wary of the Oculus.

I've tried other VR headsets. They have 2 big problems that interrupt the experience. The biggest is that there are wires. They are always on your mind because they're touching you and you don't want to trip over them or wrap them around you. It seems like a small thing, but it's not as it totally distracts you from enjoying VR. The second issue is that you can't see the walls, desks, etc. around you ... but you know you might hit them if you're not careful ... even though you can't see them. This is a distraction from enjoying the experience too, and it's potentially painful! The Quest solves both. No wires! It also lets you easily define a ""safe space"" in your room, and when you get close to an edge it shows you inside the VR view ... in other words, you can see it when you get close. It's very clever and works great. It feels like magic. :-)

Had the Quest for 3 days. Returned it, while simultaneously ordering the S (which I received Saturday thanks to Prime One Day). Have a high end laptop (with a mini DP), but I was looking to replace my old Rift. Loved the idea behind the Quest, and it's no doubt, excellent hardware, but for me, it was too uncomfortable, and I saw some compromises being made with certain games in order to keep up with my original Rift's performance (did back and forth comparisons while my Rift was still connected). The screen was kick butt over the Rift, but I missed my Steam games and some of the Rift/S only (for now) games.If I didn't have a capable PC, the Quest would have been a no brainer (eventually, I would have purchased whatever I needed to make it comfortable). The S turned out to be everything I was hoping for. Comfortable as heck, smooth as silk gameplay, a beautiful screen which made the Rift seem blurry in comparison, and no longer a slave to sensors. I do miss the black level of the OLED Quest, but now I can sell off my old Rift. Still excited to see how the link cable turns out. I will always keep my eye on the Quest! One never knows....

Excellent product which is pretty easy to setup out of the box. As well as its use as a standalone VR set, it can also be connected to a PC and play PC VR games. The PC needs to be relatively high spec per Oculus' stated minimum requirements. There are instructions on the internet on how to setup the Quest for wired or wireless connection with a PC. On its own the Quest is already very immersive. With a PC playing Half Life Alyx it truly feels like the future has arrived.The Quest hardware is high quality and controllers are comfortable and intuitive. As important is the software and interface which are excellent and easy to use. Friendly enough so you can just pick up and play (assuming you at least have basic familiarity with your smart phone and home network), but also giving you ability to tweak more advanced settings if you want to.Overall, the package exceeded expectations, especially given the user-friendliness and versatility of not only the headset itself but also the accompanying software, software eco-system (needed for PC VR) and its price point.UPDATE (2020/8/30): I am reducing my rating from 5-stars to 3-stars. Originally, Oculus did not require purchasers to register with a Facebook account. Unfortunately, that policy has changed and in future all users will need to have a valid Facebook account to use this device. I personally do not feel comfortable having all my personal info vacuumed up by Facebook and hence cannot in good conscience maintain a 5-star recommendation.

My only exposure to VR was the google cardboard which I hated. Made me nauseous, graphics were awful from a phone so never tried anything VR again. I heard so much about this item that I decided to get one for myself for Xmas. So glad I did. I'm now a VR addict and I'm an older gentleman. Games are amazing to play in the virtual world. Beat Saber is addicting.Screen door effect is there, but I don't really notice it much in games and is minimal. Graphics are fine, I'm sure with a Valve Index etc , the graphics are probably much better. But there's nothing wrong with the visuals with this.I'm now gonna get a computer tethered headset Vale/Rift S upgrade as soon as I can afford it. But this is great for quick playing and worth every cent. If you're someone like me who had only tried phone based options then you have to give this a try. And I'll always keep one of these around for the wireless option. Can't wait to see the next generation of this item. I will be buying one of those as well.

Just got it in the mail today.  It took me about an hour to get it going with all the downloads and updates and all.  I already had the Oculus App because I have the Oculus Go, but it wouldn't bring up the Quest for headset to install.  So then I had to uninstall my Oculus App and reinstall the app.  To do that I got put in a long queue because everybody and is brother is trying to install their apps on opening day.  Then when I finally got it paired, I had to wait a while for the headset to update.My main beef is that Oculus didn't update the app I already had, so I wouldn't have to uninstall and then reinstall the app.I'm sure we'll have a lot of fun with it.  We've only just begun.

 This is a truly ground-breaking device for VR. The price is acceptable for the experience you get from it and after attending the Oculus Connect 6 via Oculus Venues in VR, I think there is a bright future ahead. This is not just a toy or a gaming platform. This is a new way to consume content, be it surfing the net, socializing online, watching movies or YouTube and of course playing games. Oculus Connect 6 Day One presentations showed the business sector has some uses for it as well. Getting it now, is getting head start to the future of the media creation and consumption.As for the quality of the device itself - it is my first VR device (Google Mobile VR not counting) so I have nothing to compare it to and perhaps this is a good thing. I understand that the graphic quality is not up to par with the Rift and Vive counterparts, but what it has is enough for the brain to be completely fooled into believing the virtual environments it creates. It's not just my opinion. I took it to work and half my office ordered one the same day. They all were blown away. This ability alone, to take it on the road, anywhere is worth its money already.I've read that it felt heavy for some people but I didn't notice it at all, neither has my wife and my 11-years old kid. The little one 6-years old did complain a bit. The sound quality could be better though again we didn't mind. I bought special earbud earplugs for it (not the original as they are quite expansive) and it, apparently, didn't make that much of a difference. I understand that quality earphones for Oculus Quest have not materialized yet on the market.I really recommend this product and I really recommend reading about what Facebook and Oculus has in their mind for its future (hands tracking in software, completely free in November 2019). This is a great purchase for anyone. A glimpse into the future and fantastic entertainment value for its money.

I own, in addition to the Quest, the Oculus Go and the Lenovo Mirage Solo.  Both the latter two headsets will usually keep a pretty good charge for at least a couple weeks when turned off.  However, every time I charge the Quest and then unplug the charger (which I did last night) the next time I want to use it won't start and gives me a  low battery warning.  I just tried to use it and it happened again.  They need to fix this!  So my only option is to always leave plugged into the charger which I really don't like to do.  I've tried turning it on after a charge and doing a shut down. Doesn't help.  The battery still drains out in a a few hours.  As much as I like the Quest, and I do like it, a lot, I would not have bought it knowing what I know now.Update. My battery is now keeping a charge just fine while not in use even over a couple of weeks. I might add at the latest update to the headset is marvelous. It’s like I got a whole new headset. I’m really pleased with how they continue to work on an upgrade my purchase.

This was my first VR experience, and initially, I was just blown away.  It's amazing how real it feels.  That said, there just aren't good, fun games to play.  After Beat Saber, there really wasn't much interesting to me, and Beat Saber really lacked a good variety of songs without spending absurd amounts of extra money on DLC.  I did purchase 7-8 games, and there are a bunch that are cool, but none really have great staying power after Beat Saber.  Almost everything in this feels like a novelty rather than a real game.

I have zero experience with VR and paid no attention to it until I started seeing some reviews for quest. I didn’t expect people to be saying such good things about vr but from what I saw in the reviews, being a wireless untethered device with solid motion tracking, my interest grew. I decided to order one and upon receiving it, had read about a lot of the games, pros, cons. My initial experience has been impressive to say the least. This technology is pretty cool and it blew me away with the interaction you have with the hand controllers. Being a console gamer since NES, I had never played anything like this before. It is a game changer for sure. Best saber, superhot vr, and drop dead are all pretty excellent games that I like. I’ve tried a few others and while they are good, the price might not justify their worth. You can tell that this technology will continue to improve as the resolution isn’t the greatest and the battery life a bit short. That would be my biggest complaint...the resolution. Considering $400 can get you a 4K console, the quest is obviously not that and a bit pixely, but by no means is it a deal breaker and doesn’t negate the fun factor. From what I understand that’s the compromise being made in order to be completely wireless, which is fantastic. I can’t imagine being tethered to a high end computer (that I don’t have) while playing these games. At $400 plus the cost of games, it’s a bit steep, and unless oculus continues with a steady stream of strong titles, not sure how long the wow factor will last...it’s incredible technology that will depend on a continual release of new fun games. Just know you won’t be getting console/pc quality resolution. I expect the inevitable quest 2 or quest 3 will be the real game changers, but for now this is an extremely fun device worth giving a shot if you have the money to spend.

Facebook forces you to get a Facebook account to fully use it. Without it forget about playing online or using Oculus Venues. So basically if you want to use your $400-$500 device you also have to relinquish your privacy and give them your personal information or go through the struggle of creating a fake account.

The Oculus quest is taking Virtual Reality to the next level. If you only get one app, make it Beat Saber.Beat Saber is the reason I purchased the Oculus Quest. I was playing on my Oculus Rift CV1, and I was thinking, if there were no wires this would be perfect. Boom! Oculus Quest!There is a great selection of game and apps to choose from now that the Quest has been out for a while.Now, with the Oculus link capabilities, you can connect your Quest to your PC, and enjoy much higher quality games. I’m playing Alien Isolation with the Mother Mod, and is is awesome!The reason I took off one star is because while the audio is functional, it is a total letdown compared to the Oculus Rift. Those headphone are amazing compared to what they went with in the Quest. It’s doable, but barely. I’m using some iPhone earbuds until I find something better.  Don’t buy the Oculus earbuds or similar. They don’t produce sound that is worth the money.

If you've used an Oculus Rift on PC, the experience is almost identical to that, but with a slight downgrade in graphics. Fewer special effects, lower-resolution textures, etc. But if you compare the actual interaction and playability within games, the experience is almost 100% the same, and I'd argue considerably better given the wire-free nature of the product. Further, the fact that I can press a button and jump into VR means that I can use the Quest in short stints here and there, without firing up a PC to do it, making it 100x more likely I'll use it at all. This right there is the kicker that makes it even remotely possible that my wife would try it - it's so easy, she can throw it on, fire it up, and get to playing Beat Saber or what-have-you.Battery life is good (2+ hours so far), game selection is good and improving, responsiveness and tracking accuracy is perfect, as far as I can tell, and it even remembers the locations and boundaries I draw for the play space! I'm blown away! Now make a 2.0 with a modern SOC (preferably a new Nvidia Tegra chip) and we're in business!If only this were available 6 months ago! Alas, it's available now, and I can't recommend it enough.

Exceeds my expectations. The package arrives with a very premium look and feel. It was very easy to setup but I did watch a few Youtube videos so I could get up and running as quick as possible. Vader Immortal was my first purchase and it does not dissappoint. It is almost as realistic as the VOID experience at Disney Springs. Wielding a lightsaber in the game works flawless. Tried the other apps and things like Netflix and Amazon Video were interesting to sit an enjoy watch TV or movies. Dont think I would do it that often because the quality isnt as good as my own TVUPDATE - 8-6-18 After 1 week I have bought a few games to go along with this from the Oculus store. Battery life is about 2.5 hours so you need to buy an external 10000+ mAh for longer sessions. I suggest getting rechargeable AA batteries for the Touch hand controllers. Already went thru 2 sets of batteries the first week. I have watched movies from my Plex server thru the web browser. Firefox VR was just released and works pretty good as well. Good assortment of free content. Download SideQuest to install mods and other content not available in the Quest store. I am using Virtual Desktop  to access my Steam VR content. I couldnt get other free solutions working like ALVR. Steam VR content is not flawless, you do get a little bit of stutter every now and again. Possibly a really good NightHawk gaming Wifi router would solve that issue. I have AC1700 Netgear router.

I definitely recommend this device for people interested in checking out the VR experience. In 2016 I spent a lot of time using an HTC Vive in college. In 2017, I decided to purchase an Oculus Rift and I used it for architectural design using custom software. In 2018, I bought 11 Oculus Go's in order to use them to teach VR development at the college level. In May 2019, I purchased the Oculus Quest and I really love it.Fifty years from now historians will look back and may well consider this the watershed device for VR. The Rift and Vive required an expensive computer and were tethered with cables. The Go is only 3 degrees of freedom and one controller. The Quest is the first Minimum Viable Product in my opinion. Here's why: It has a good price point, the graphics quality is just good enough to eliminate the screen door effect, no wires, it's very comfortable, the processing power is just at the bottom level to be good enough for a very good experience and the tracking seems flawless to me. I highly recommend this device with one caveat... Oculus is restricting independent development on the device which might keep the level of quality higher but will ultimately suffocate innovation at a critical time for VR. There just aren't enough things to do with it beyond shooting things. I hope this is useful.

In the first 30 days of using the Quest, I lost 15 pounds and felt like I was 35 again (I'm 57). I started out at 240 pounds. My knees had gotten to the point that I had to go up and down stairs one step at a time using my right leg. After 2 weeks of beat saber, I was able to go up and down stairs like they were nothing and was already feeling 10 years younger. By the end of the first 30 days, I was kicking ass and taking names. My daughter and grandkids said I looked like I was a ninja when I played beat saber. Then Thanksgiving hit. I quit working out, ate way too much and the next thing I knew it was the 10th of January and I had not only gained all my weight back but even more, as I was now 245 pounds. I was back to taking the stairs one step at a time. I'm back on the Quest again, and back to where I feel like I'm 20 years younger again. It's now February 9th and I'm back down to 223 pounds. The thrill of the Fight makes me lose the most weight I think as it is a High-Intensity Workout. But, my favorite now is Pistol Whip. I like to play two ways. For the most aerobic workout, Iike to put it on dual guns and the hardest setting and go as hard as I can. I can beat all the levels doing this without dying but it's hard and you'll have to move your ass to not die. The other way is to truly challenge myself. I usually do this at the end of my workout. Put on deadeye, where you have to be accurate and get it on. Pistol Whip is so much like being John Wick, I started actually thinking it was saying hello Mr. Wick instead of Pistol Whip at the beginning. You'll notice the John Wick references as soon as you hit start. Great game and within 30 minutes I'm soaking wet with sweat. Don't have a large area? I play all kinds of places including sitting down. You wouldn't believe how much you can sweat and how tired you can get after an hour of sitting and playing some of the games. The only think I can suggest is to get into it full swing. I watch a lot of people who barely move in VR, I guess because they're scared, but you've got to get involved and make those hard shots, jump to the side, and duck all the way down if you really want to benefit.

While the Oculus Quest had a bit of a rocky start for me, with some graphical glitching and screen tearing, those issues have since been patched out. Even with those issue though, they didn't hamper my complete amazement and fasination with using the headset. Having tried PC VR before, the lower graphic quality is noticable, but matters little as the experience is still thoroughly enjoyable, and the lack of any wires to contend with is very liberating. If you have ever considered trying out VR, or just want a headset of your own and can't afford a good enough gaming PC, I cannot recommend the Quest enough. Honestly, even if i did have a gaming pc, the Quest might still be my first choice.

It took some years to finally decide to go with this VR set.  The resolution is pixelated since you are so close to the screen when wearing it, but not a gamechanger for me.  The benefits outweigh the cons for a completely wireless headset.  Many of the games and videos are short, but an awesome workout when you have the space to use it.  This headset may be a little weighted for some so compare to other models to see what works for you.  Ultimately, the latest update to use hand recognition is great so the controllers are not required for some navigation.  Great way to save on controller batteries.  I will more than likely respond with more info after longer use but really like this device.

The quest has been the go to for many consumers for the past year. With frequent updates and amazing support from Oculus this headset is a must buy!I recently received mine on June 13th and have been amazed since powering it on. Before purchasing I tried my friends Rift S and found that I did not get motion sick like I thought I would. After researching several products I decided the quest was the best bang for my buck and I wasn't wrong!Once it showed up I powered it up and even though is has a lower refresh rate, at 72Hz vs the Rift S i previously tried at 80Hz. I still did not feel the effects of motion sickness. That was a major concern for me and I am happy to report that its superb in curbing motion sickness, for me anyway.The astounding amount of updates and new software capabilities of this machine has been staggering, considering that is has only been out for just over a year. The fact that you can use it wirelessly and tethered to your PC opens up a massive library of games you can't get on other devices. With the quest you can utilize the quest store for headset specific games, the oculus store for Rift and Rift S games, and the steam store for even more content to digest.All in all with today's current tech and the plethora of abilities that this headset currently possesses i would highly recommend to anyone who is currently in the market for a VR system.Thank you Oculus for making such a great  debut, and then actually spending time improving upon your efforts tbe way you have!!

I've been a VR enthusiast since the nineties, but only with the current resurgence have I been able to really explore it. I've owned most of the major platforms to come out over the last few years, I recently picked up the Go as a pick-up-and-play solution, but wound up returning it to get this instead. As much as I enjoy the PC VR experience, I have to say it's a lot easier to just pick up the Quest and go to it.Currently, my favorite game is Moon Rider, a free web-based ""Beat saber"" clone with a punch mode which has become my nightly exercise. You know you're on to a winner when you have to pace yourself on exercise. The graphics are not as good as PC, admittedly, but they are good enough, even at these early days. Give it a year and devs will be really pushing the hardware.Basically, VR has been waiting for a fully untethered and portable room-scale solution, and this is really doing the job. I think of it as the Model T of consumer VR: not the first, but the one that will bring the technology to the general public. This is a definite step in the right direction, and a lot of fun.

An amazing starting point for those just getting into VR, and an awesome continuation for those tired of the cables and setup required for PCVR.

For what it is: a completely mobile VR gaming rig — it’s fantastic.  I’ve had an amazing time playing with it and it’s so easy to set up and play my non-techie girlfriend has no trouble with setup and playing.Cons:It’s pretty uncomfortable to wear. I dunno how they missed the mark but it’s just ... not great. Battery life is decent, at about two hours, which would be ok except for the fact that it takes about that long to recharge it. For comfort and batt life implementing a battery-pack counter-weight improves things considerably.The mobile process is underpowered. That’s not to say that games are good but by going with an older platform ( ostensibly to save money) they sacrificed resolution. The speakers sometimes crap-out, especially when the rig is being taxed.Tracking is excellent, however, and while maybe ‘lower’ resolution, the games I’ve played are smooth, engaging, and so much fun. In most cases, it just works and well!I am overall very happy with my purchase and excited about the future of VR gaming.Oh— I’m a software developer and almost 50!  😀

Pros:* easy to set up and use* no additional equipment needed* good stability of VR world while moving one's headCon:* limited frame rate and image detailThe Oculus Quest does a pretty good job for its price.  In a few years it will probably seem hopelessly antiquated and crude, but it's good enough to use and enjoy today.  The illusion of a virtual world is convincing enough that I have to get my bearings when I remove the headset.  Most users may see it primarily as a gaming device, and the Quest comes with a small set of demo games, but it can also be used to stream 3D videos.  Be prepared to encounter encouragement to buy games and connect to social media.To use the Quest you must create an Oculus account, but a traditional Facebook account is not required -- if there's a difference, given that Facebook owns Oculus.  Consider the Quest to be like an early PC or an early smartphone: good enough to use, but not (yet) the ultimate VR device.

The VR experience is amazing. It's pretty easy to get lost in the experience and time just slips by. Actual usage is primarily limited by the number of games/titles. Would love to see more concert and live sporting events for viewing. One note of caution is if you've had Lasik with different focal lengths in each eye, it's difficult to find a good focus with the Oculus. When I had my Lasik, the focus distance for my eyes were not made the same so that I could have vision far away and up close. Otherwise, I would have lost my near vision. The brain eventually resolves this difference. However, with the Oculus, it's difficult to find the right focal point because both eyepieces move together. It would be ideal if each eyepiece could be adjusted separately for optimum focus.

First, wow when I got this I was so excited for it but slowly its letting me down with three things really. Tracking, tracking and tracking. Man I cannot play Beat Saber without it losing tracking. Ive only had it for 2 weeks maybe. And it just keeps getting worse. Ive looked into all the reasons it could be happening, clean the cameras, big room, lots of light. Expert mode on Quest is impossible, the left side (red saber) is the worse it seems. It just disappears sometimes as I'm about to hit a block. Just stops tracking for a second. Maybe I have a defective piece of machinery, I dont know. The game itself will hiccup too. It just freezes and starts up again randomly during times. I haven't found anyone else having this issue yet. But it makes me not want it anymore. I cant do what I want on it. Are their external tracking set ups I can get? Should I just send it back? Should I wait for the new generation or next one? Im not having fun when it happens, very disappointed. I would love to write more or even write things I like about it but that gets shadowed right now by this tracking issue. Hope yours runs better then mine, its just like me to get the one defective Quest. Everyone else's Quest works but mine.

I purchased this device as an entry level VR set and so far it has exceeded my expectations.Prior to the Oculus Quest I only used smart phone VR and Google Day Dream and Oculus Quest takes the cake. With the recent additions of Oculus Link I can see Oculus putting a lot of Effort for updates in the future and with the recent retirement of Oculus GO the Quest is looking like it will only grow from here on out. The portability is also awesome especially to demo at family events.So far my recommendations for the Quest are as follows:-SuperHot- An amazing first person shooter where time moves when you do. A great mechanic.-Beat Saber- Great for the whole family including grandparents.-Accounting+ a fun puzzle adventure from the creator of Rick and Morty.-Rec Room- Great fun for little ones and even adults. I spent so much time just playing dodge ball against my little cousins on PSVR.I strongly recommend for anyone interested in VR and doesn't want to break the bank.

I bought one of these after following a few Youtubers who owned them.  I finally saved up and bought the Quest and was not disappointed at all.  In fact I was blown away by what this device can do for you.  I not only play games on this device but you can download videos that transport you to other places and you really feel you’re there!  I downloaded the Norte Dame Cathedral video and was transported to Paris, France in a matter of minutes.  I love my Quest and am glad I purchased it.  I can take any stressful day, slip on the Quest and disappear into VR for a few hours.  It actually has lowered my blood pressure while I was in the fishing games.  I had been out of the gaming scene for many years and this device has sold me on VR.  If you have the money, buy one.  You won’t be disappointed.

Had to return my ment to be bought new, Quest. Had a previous user's profile already loaded and had to factory reset it. Spent most of the night trying to get it to connect to PC with link, only to find out is usb port was broken and kept losing connection to the computer on and off. I saved up for about 2 1/2 months to even order this. I was trying to buy new to avoid having issues and have everything work smoothly. Now I am without a Quest, and am not sure when I'll even be able to acquire a new one at retail again. Very upset with Amazon not checking what they ship before shipping it. So stuck without. So again I say buyer beware. Make sure its new and working correctly.

It’s pretty freaking sweet! I have zero issues with this and quite honestly better than actually gaming on a console or PC. My only thing is sometimes I feels blurry but I am not sure if it's because that’s just how it looks or because it’s not sitting right. I’m assuming it’s cause it’s not sitting in the “sweet spot” as they say so I’m gonna go with user error. It’s a lot of money to dish out but it’s brandnew what do you expect 🤷🏼‍♂️. Honestly if you’re thinking about it and alreadybinterested chances are you know what you’re getting into and have tried out VR. GET IT. the 64gb version is perfect for everyone the only time you’d need more is if you’re side loading other media like movies or side loading other games etc.

Bought as a present and it was a hit. Pictures are so real looking as if you were there. Does not come with headphones so everyone can hear what is playing.

I wanted an all-in-one VR headset and this baby does not disappoint!Pros: This is an incredibly immersive experience! Nothing like I've ever experienced before. This is the VR we were promised in the 90s. There are plenty of games, from first-person shooters, to aerobic dancing and saber games (that don't feel like exercise!), to 3D movies, historical site visits, and so much more.Cons: It's a little heavy, especially after an hour of use. It also has about an hour of battery life, and I suppose that helps not to binge too long. You can plug it in for extended play.

Gotta be one of the most unique and fun experiences I've ever had. I've been playing video games since I was a kid and I'd heard about VR. Oh man, I've been missing out big time. This is some cutting edge stuff, and it's not kidding when people say that it's immersive. It's really hard to explain what makes it so good other than saying that it makes you feel like you're actually in the game. Just get one, you won't regret it.

I literally take it anywhere I can and have my friends and family try it out (the more people get interested in VR, the better the market gets)! If you have any doubts about this, buy from Amazon or Best Buy and return it if you're not absolutely amazed.You gotta see it to believe it! I have an Oculus Go and an Oculus Quest.

I bought it on day one, and showed it to everyone in the office. Everyone loved it and many are considering buying it. This is the product that could drive mass VR adoption. The only potential downside is the lack of killer apps like the legend of zelda or mario did for the switch.However, with games like beat saber, robo recall, orbus, dead and buried, I expect you to die, there are plenty of great experiences on here you can play for a long time. But nothing with the long run time and triple A quality of a first party nintendo game. This is written in may 2019, potentially other games could come to the quest and change that, for instance storm lands could.

The pentile matrix of the Quest despite its 1600p resolution caused uncomfortably apparent SDE for me. I noticed it more than the $200 Oculus Go.  I understand for most people this is not critical as most hmd's suffer this, but I don't expect a downgrade in SDE when I intend to upgrade.  Yes it has deeper blacks, but I'm not playing those dark games, and the dark grey of other headsets never bothered me. Switching to the HP reverb was the solution for my specific use cases.Note: for most people, the Quest or Rift S is a better unit all things considered for gaming only. But I privilege screen over everything else. And since the Reverb thus far can do everything reasonably well, not perfectly but satisfactorily, and has a fantastic screen compared to the others, I'm now set.

Too heavy. The thing kept wanting to slide down my face unless I tightened it to the point of it hurting my face. With or without the glasses spacer, it lets light in which causes odd halo effects.Quality is not significantly better than the Rift that I already have. In a dim room or a room shaded on one side, the tracking can get very shaky. I'd rather just have sensor bars and a steady view.Screen door effect is fairly strong. Focus blurs as the unit slides down the face, so considering the weight of the unit I found myself holding it up with my hand just t o get a steady image.Nice try, Facebook, but the hype doesn't meet the product in my hands. Maybe VR needs time to grow, or maybe I need a higher end unit.

Absolutely amazing and fun device for all ages! Rated four stars because of the slightly ""fuzzy"" imagery. However, I suspect/hope this will be improved to a crisper image with future generations of the device. This is also something to be used with caution for those that get motion sickness as easily as I do. There are only a a few games/apps that I can enjoy without triggering a headache. I highly recommend adjusting the setting for less likelihood of motion problems, but some games just have to be avoided altogether. Lastly, the device is heavy and can become uncomfortable to wear on the forehead, cheekbones, and neck after awhile. Hopefully, they will also become lighter weight in the future. All in all, though, our family loves this and there's something fun for all of us to enjoy...from games to meditations and everything in between!

Problem 1: I got my oculus a couple days ago new. everything was working just fine. i set it up and put in the batteries that CAME WITH the oculus quest. i played for a day and it was amazing. The next day i was playing and the right controller stopped working. i thought it wasn’t that big of a deal and just took them out and put them back in. The controller didn’t work still. so i took them out again and noticed the batteries were LEAKING OUT. i was really worried. i went and got new batteries and put them in, didn’t work. so i tried cleaning the controller out with rubbing alcohol, didn’t work. i wasn’t paying $70 for a new one so i was going to message oculus about my problem. but couldn’t find anything to message them on. then i tried to find there number but couldn’t find that either. i found something about submitting a ticket to them, then wait 1-2 days to see if they would respond. i gave my controller a couple hours to rest and would come back to it later. i came back and it didn’t work. so i cleaned it out again and let it sit for a couple minutes. then i was about to submit my ticket but i put the battery back in and it worked. i let it sit for a while then i came back and started playing. It’s been 2 days and it’s been working fine. whenever i take the batteries out and put them back in it won’t work sometimes so i’ll just try again and it will be fine. i’m still very upset about this and i’m sorry for other customers with this problem.Problem 2: this isn’t a big problem but i’d like the put it out there. whenever i try to cast my oculus to my phone it never works. it’s only worked once by casting through my oculus to my phone. but it doesn’t work now. then i’ve tried casting through my phone and it says something will pop up on the oculus but i get nothing. i hope i can fix this problem.other than that the oculus is an amazing device and i love it. i would give it 5 stars if i didn’t have those problems though.

This thing is a blast. You really can’t get an impression of what it’s like from YouTube videos. Really a game changer!Only two minor issues: the lenses are blurred at the sides, but fortunately the “sweet spot” is sizable enough that it isn’t an issue. Just something to expect before you buy. Also, my eye-width slider only goes down to 59, but tends to stay at around 60. Supposed to bottom-out at 58.Strap a battery pack on the back with some velcro tape and it adds substantial playtime before needing to plug it into a wall, plus it acts as a counter balance!

Ok, I would like to start of by saying this is a good product, it is a good vr headset. However, it really annoyed me that Oculus decided to sell a prototype headset for ~$400 and release a better, cheaper version, maybe a year later, with little warning. Again, this thing is a good product, I’m just really pissed off. The negatives of this product are same with most other consoles, freezing, crashing, occasional bugs, but there are some worse things. A couple months ago mine had a software update and it caused it to black screen, everything went black and I couldn’t do anything with the headset, so I had to factory reset the thing, and occasionally  when I tried  to launch games the headset just shut off, these problems have smoothed out and are less of a problem recently. All in all, just buy the newer cheaper, better one if you getting a quest. A dick move from Oculus.

I have a vr ready pc, but I have never used a vr headset before. I was picking between this and the rift s because the quest seems like a lot of fun. I was worried about performance issues, framerates, and the refresh rate of the screen. None of these were an issue. Framerates was great, the Hertz of the screen is really nice, and I have not experienced performance issues. If you have never ever experienced vr, you have a vr ready pc, you travel, and you are picking between this and the rift s, go with the quest. Expect around 2-3 hours of play time with games like job simulator, superhot, and beatsaber.

It's unclear why so many Amazon stores are allowed to buy up the world's inventory at retail then sell for $130 more. If this were an essential item during a global disaster, this would be price-gouging. Why can't they buy wholesale and sell at the retail price? This business model will not last as I will pre-order whenever possible. That being said,  Michael's had the earliest delivery promise under Amazon Prime and no extra charge for 2 day shipping, which has been slipping due to Covid-19.  I was shocked that Michael's shipped it the day of the order (Saturday) and it arrived Monday. I'm so happy to have this now when most other inventory is gone. Maybe the extra week or two of use was worth the extra hundred. It's a fantastic product. The tracking within a playspace is what makes this mind-blowing beyond other VR. It will remember the map you created. You can walk from room to room physically while moving in the virtual world. I like to put furniture where the virtual furniture is and take a seat when needed. The headset is front heavy and hurts my head and face. I had to find the best balance and also used a scarf as a headband. The experience is worth it, but don't play too long. Take breaks. Adjust the pressure on your face frequently. You will get used to it.

This is probably one of the best value VR headsets on the market. It's important to recognize that Oculus released an Oculus Link cable(basically a high quality USB-C), which allows games from the PC to be played without the limitation of the Oculus Quest store while still retaining the portability. The battery can last for a few hours, but you will want to charge it pretty often. The controllers don't burn through batter that quickly, and it's intuitive to use. I haven't had any frame issues or the screen door effect, and it fits with glasses well too. It's lightweight and there can be no cords involved, making the VR experience much more liberating and enjoyable.

I own the Oculus Go and the Oculus Quest. I picked up the Quest because of the better resolution, hoping to view videos shot on my Insta360 EVO camera. I assumed that the apps available in the Oculus Go and Quest store would be the same. I was wrong.The app to view video directly from the EVO is available for the Go but not for the Quest. Apparently the Go is considered an entry-level device by Oculus - made for watching videos and playing some light games - and the Quest is built for more hardcore VR gaming. There are other gaps in the apps available on the store as well, but for my purposes this one was the most annoying.I understand that there can be hardware limitations on the Go, but the Quest is their flagship product - anything that runs on the Go will run in the Quest. Not offering the same apps that run on the Go and trying to pigeonhole users into different categories is short-sighted on Oculus’s part.Other than that, the Quest is well built, the graphics and sound are excellent, and the interface is well executed. If you’re buying the Quest or the Go for a specific purpose, make sure the apps you want to run are available on the device you choose.

I ordered this for a Santa gift for my kids. Product arrived quickly. Box was in great condition. Batteries came with the product so you could use the game and remotes right away. I will say I was very amazed with how realistic this is. You really feel like you are in the Games! You also can sync this up to your phone and watch what the player is seeing. It makes it more interesting.A couple downsides to it: 1. One of the batteries was bad or exploded as when you opened the remote backing, it was sticky and there was the white powdery substance that you see from bad batteries. It is all in the remote. It has not affected the use but for the money spent, I was a little upset. 2. You can’t create more than one profile on this. I set this up prior to Christmas morning, and set it up under me. I found out when the kids wanted to play, that they aren’t able to have their own profile. As far as I can tell, if you play a game and leave off somewhere, it’s going to pick right back up where it was left off when someone else plays.Overall, I’m very satisfied with this product. It def gets you moving and provides some exercise. It has been a good device for me and the kids to do stuff together.

The little dome on the mountainside atmosphere that you are in while accessing the menu is worth the price right off the bat. I didn't want to give my son (whom this was a bday gift for) a turn on it. I loved it. Games can be pricey, but comes with the territory I imagine. I have a feeling this is going to be a fun and wonderful investment. My only complaint is the fact that upon opening the box, I discovered that there was absolutely NO paperwork included. Nothing. No user manual. No quick reference guide, no warranty card. Nothing. It is my fault for not checking if it was included.

The Quest is a very impressive machine and actually feels like VR is ready to really take off. The ability to setup anywhere is great especially sticking it in a bag and heading to a friends house. As the software updates more features become available like pass through+ and soon finger tracking without controllers. There are tons of pros but using it I have found downsides that are by no means make it a dealbreaker.Cons:- Needing a smartphone to set up the quest even if you only need it once why not just eliminate that step all together.- The way the headset tracks the controllers is the four cameras on the corners on the front side of the unit. There aren’t any on the side so it will lose tracking which for some things makes it frustrating-The touch controllers would have been nice to just have rechargeable batteries instead of AA batteries. I would have probably bought a base station for it if this were the case and I’d definitely recommend getting some rechargeable AA’s.-Not being able to stream the image to any smart TV or computer is annoying. I understand it works if you pick up a chromecast TV attachment and it can stream to smart phones. Like I said, just seems annoying since just about everyone has a smart tv but not a chromecast it’s just one more useless thing to buy.- The visor part that your head rests on is cloth based and it absorbs all sweat and will feel drenched after strenuous activity on Beat Saber, won’t be much passing around the headset then.Pros:- If you have a decent computer and a good home network you can have a untethered PCVR and it works brilliantly, google it there’s multiple ways to accomplish this even for free.- Oculus/Facebook is relentlessly updating the software to add incredible featuresThere are cons that I went into detail about I feel like a lot of people will run into them. The pros which I only listed a few of tons more, by far outweigh the cons I’d recommend anyone to try out VR with the Quest.

First off this is a great product really entertaining for friends and family it becomes the life of the party and has endless hours of play time to give. that being said getting into the PC aspect of it. there is some limitations with this product. since there are no sensors (outside the ones built into the headset) given with said product. a lot of occulus Rift games played through link can appear really clunky slow and not fun to play. Gorn, Blade And Sorcery are good examples. two handed weapons are impossible to use because your tracking goes bunk any time you move out of the angle. Gorn isnt terrible but B&S was very apparent. even single handed combat in B&S was a chore and really not solid or smooth at all. now is this really a deal breaker? not really it plays games like walking dead saints and sinners pretty decently and smoothly. its a great headset and since the Rift has been sold out for ages and hardly comes back into stock this is a good alternative IMO. shooter games run great like Pavlov and you'll be able to access any VR game but take that with a grain of salt because you wont get the best tracking possible without room sensors. i believe you can purchase and link to the headset but you'd have to look for guides. if you want the best of the best for your PC you might want to spend the extra money to get an index or Vive but its up to you. if you are only going to be playing melee combat games with intensive tracking id do some more research to see if this is best for you. if you are casual maybe play some VRchat or TWD some shooters id go for it. it is kind of a steep price range though if you will only be using it on PC id just wait until you can get your hands on the Rift. or go with another headset. if you plan on playing it with friends in the living room or with family this is definitely the headset for you

After the first day, I feel like there is already so much to do in this realm of virtual space! There is not much you can't do, provided this industry keeps growing! You will definitely entertain friends and family by letting them put it on and let them experience this wizardry for themselves. The only issue I have had with it is getting a little motion sickness from trying to move with the control sticks rather than teleportation or just walking around. There are not many games that make you move with the control sticks, so that is good.Your guardian space , the space in real life that you make so that you don't bump into things, is really neat! You can peek our and see the real world in black and white with your headset on...no need to take it off! I played about 2.5 hours straight, and at that point, it does feel a little heavy, but I will make sure to take breaks more often in the future. I like testing the limits of things (even if I try to catch a frisbee above my head and smash my hand into the ceiling...yes I am a tall person!)I hope whoever reads this review understand just how much fund you can have in a non-real place.

The Quest is a really great headset. The only real downside is that the graphics and refresh rates are lower than what you would find in PC headsets, but it is by no means unplayable and doesn't ruin the experience at all. The wireless capabilities are nice if you want to bring it to other people's houses or if you just don't want to deal with wires getting in your way. I have tried the Rift S and it definitely has better graphics quality compared to the Quest but the benefits of the Quest outweigh that negative. As for the storage, the 64 GB is plenty and especially with the option of PC linking, I see no reason to go for the pricier 128 GB. Overall, it's an amazing headset that is well worth it.

I've been interested in VR since the very beginning, but, as a younger person just barely out of college, I never had (and still don't have) the means to afford $800+ setups. I finally decided to treat myself and grab the quest, and man, I am absolutely blown away.As soon as I put this thing on my head, I was smiling like an idiot. As my first vr experience, having only seen it through YouTube videos, the simple joy of feeling totally immersed and interacting with things around me was mind blowing. I couldn't help but pass it over to my girlfriend who was watching, and my dad a few minutes later, and they all had the same reactions: big, goofy grins.And that's what makes this device in particular so special. Out of all the VR setups, this one has to be the most social. With the quest, you don't need to have someone follow you to your bedroom where your pc is, or worse, lug the pc somewhere else. Just take the headset off and pass it around. It's so simple and fun.As someone who has never used VR before, the graphics in most games I've played look great. You can tell they've been toned back in some places, but honestly, the games are too fun to care. If you're coming from a pc, you'll probably see a graphical downgrade, but this device isn't meant as an upgrade. It's an alternative.Recently, oculus just announced the icing on the cake, making the Quest possibly the most versatile VR headset around. Soon, they'll be rolling out Quest Link - if you already have a gaming pc, you can connect (via their premium cable, but still...) to a pc and play full, pc oculus games. Not only that, but in an update, they are rolling out hand tracking. No need for controllers at all. Just your hands. Pretty cool, and I had no clue when I bought this. Now it's essentially the Nintendo switch of VR. Best of both worlds.I'll finish by saying this: if you have been interested in vr, but don't see yourself getting a gaming pc and $800 headset, then this is the device for you. Full stop, best bang for your buck. Just get it.

I got the 128 GB version from Amazon.Pros:The guardian system is cool and I DID NOT GET ANY MOTION SICKNESS with the 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF) that comes with this front-facing cameras guardian system. However, it's probably related to programs that took advantage of the 6DOF.Vadar Immortal would best summarize as YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE THERE! It's only episode 1 but it's just incredible!.All the games I tried were interesting and fun. It's much bigger then what you see in the pictures. The pictures just show the frontal view. You feel the presence and the movie theater screen looks like iMax. Network videos and pictures ran well. 3D videos also work. Some of the games involve significant physical effort.Cons:The headset is front heavy. You really feel the weight when watching videos but not so much when playing games.Facebook/Oculus should consider making an improved version of ""Oculus Quest Standard Facial Interface"" as an aftermarket optional accessory to help dissipate the weight of the headset especially at the areas underneath the eyes. That'll drastically improve the user experience.Screen door effect is noticeable during video watching.Video quality is not that sharp especially in slow gaming environments when you start focusing on the details.Summary:Incredible technology with tremendous fun factor! The feeling of presence and lack of motion sickness with programs that take advantage of the 6DOF are amazing!

Purchased this just in time for Christmas, and oh man I think it was a mistake...it’s just too much fun! Haha! My son is addicted to the boxing games on here and can break some serious sweat while playing. My brother loves the beat saber game. My nephews both play Super Hot and Vader Immortal. We are planning on getting a second one for the household so we can do some local multiplayer stuff! The headset is made of great quality. It’s comfortable out of the box, but I can see why they make so many other accessories for it. I don’t know whether the ease of use or the family time we enjoy while playing it is the best thing about it. I guess you’ll have to try it for yourself and see what it does for you! Enjoy!

Arrived very quickly and in perfect-looking condition. Quality box too, all wires new, all glass covered, etc., as if it were brand new and not a refurbished at all. However, just refused to work- got to a certain point and would go no further. I could not tell you why. Neither could any amount of O support.Sometimes you just get a dud. I’m not sure it’s anything to do with their refurbishment because you can’t test for every configuration.

Just gave it 4 stars as I haven't actually played with it enough to see what all it can do.The item is really amazing in the fact that it's SO different and really fun.The hand controls to pick up items takes a bit of practice and getting use to. The head piece fits nice and if a person wears glasses it can be adjusted to accommodate your eyeglasses without damaging them so that's a BIG plus. The roller coaster ride through the dinosaur jungle made me quesy but that's just me.My husband loved it and the boxing game and got a good work out!

My God. I ripped my hair out for a week trying to figure out how to get Oculus Link (still beta) working. Now that it's working tho, WOW. I have a gen 1 rift, that I'll be giving to my roommate, as this headset does it all.This replaced my plug-in rift, and doubles as a mobile VR system. Couldn't be any happier.Advice for those just setting up Oculus link.Get all the latest drivers/firmware for your graphics card and quest. Make sure it's all installed.Make sure you have the best USB cables you can get your mitts on (along with ports on your PC that can supply the correct amperages)Turn off the Nvidia screen capture thing (can't remember what it's called, but it's in your get force experience)Quest link has been running flawlessly on my Alienware m17r5 laptop.Again. Quest is pretty neat. Couldn't be happier.

So, I own the Vive, and thought this would be a good supplement for bringing to friends' houses to show them VR, or to have something for the living room.  For those instances, it's fantastic... if you don't have a PC VR setup to know what you're missing, it's really hard not to love the Quest.  If you have a 5' x 5' space and a computer capable of running the Rift S though, get that, it's so much better.  Still, for those with deeper pockets, this might be perfect as a supplement, or to do things like play beat saber in a different room in your house.  I had to decide between one or the other, and having a PC capable of running the Rift S, I just felt like I was giving up too much with the Quest.

Was thinking about getting into the VR world. I have a pretty beefy gaming pc in my basement, but I didnt want to have to hang out down there every time I wanted a friend or the wife to play beatsaber. Read that the quest is going to support tethering to the pc, but can also be used completely stand alone which is the best of both worlds. The only downside is the 72hz refresh rate, but based on comments by Carmack that it can technically support up to 90hz, I am expecting the modding community to figure that out at some point, or have Oculus officially update that. Seriously great purchase and well worth the price of admission. We bought a second one for the wife 1 day after getting mine.

The good:I love my headset, its by far the most complete VR hardware and software package on the market (of it's time) and has amazing performance for being a mobile VR headset. Wireless VR via Virtual Desktop is shockingly actually really usable and allows me to play Half Life Alex while my PC is across the house.The bad:I had to stop using my headset last year due to the fan geometry in the headset drying out my eyes and the skin around my eyes. I think it's due to the fan in the back of the headset sucking air from around the eye pieces and blowing it out the front of the headset. It's great since it keeps the graphics processor cool and the lenses  free of fog, but since the only real opening is next to the nose, the air is sucked in around the nose piece, hits the users eyes, and then flows into the headset. This strips moisture off the users eyes and means I can only use it for 30 minutes max on dry days during the winter. I would just ask the hardware engineers working on these headsets to consider users in dry climates and add vents around the headset to avoid air having to enter next to the nose piece.-Thanks!Colin

Its great to have Parents, and grand parents who arn't into technology try one of these headsets just to be blown away with how far we have gotten in tech. But however I did not find myself using it daily or nearly as much as I thought I would, but its great for parties.  My ONLY complaint is how much every game is on the oculous store opposed to the steam VR store, you can use this headset for PC VR games outside the oculous store but you would have to buy Oculous Link or a alternative which will put you 30-80 dollars in the hole ontop of this. Which have some problems of its own. But its a great way to show how far we have come in Virtual Reality. Another Almost Perfect

Stay away from Oculus headsets until they get their quality control up to par. I've owned 4 Oculus headsets, starting with the Go. Every one of them has had issues.The Go (from Walmart) arrived with a dead pixel, so I sent it back. I liked the technology, though, so I decided to upgrade to the Quest on the next go around.My first Quest (from Amazon) arrived with a swath of darkened pixels at the top of the left eye. It was very disorienting, so I set that headset back. They were out of stock, so I had to accept a refund instead of a replacement.About a month later, I ordered my second Quest (from Walmart). It arrived with a frozen/dead green pixel, popping sound issues (or no sound at all), and would randomly freeze and crash. I was busy, so I didn't thoroughly test this headset. When I realized there were issues, I had missed the return window by 1 day.So I sent that headset in to Oculus for repairs. The RMA process was easy enough, but what I got back was another faulty unity (directly from Oculus). This one arrived with sound issues, and recently, the tracking has started to malfunction.What are the odds that all 4 units that I've owned would have issues? They obviously have some serious quality control problems. These headsets are not worth what they're charging for them. Not at this failure rate. I'd stay away from Oculus until they get their stuff together (if they ever do).

The Oculus Quest is amazing! NO WIRES! Many say it is uncomfortable and I can agree but everything else that comes in the package makes up for its faults. The Oculus Quest can play many games and looks AMAZING with its OLED display with the 1440x1600 display! Though the refresh rate is lower than other headsets, it is not noticeable at all. Tracking is insane especially since it has no external sensors. Finally the setup, THE SETUP IS SO EASY! Takes less than 5 minutes to set up and you can begin playing. All the other times after the first, you just put the headset on and you're in a whole different reality. YOU WILL NOT REGRET BUYING THIS!

This is a great system, our family had so much fun with it. HOWEVER...I have to only give it 1 star based completely on customer service. The only way to contact them is email, and every email takes 2-5 business days to respond. Some responses are maddening, like....""when you gave us your address, you left out the zip code"" even when the zip code was encluded. That took 10 days total in response time. We have had a broken unit because it fell off my son's head while playing a game and hit the floor. It is December and has been broken since September.

It's just such a good headset.Just remember games purchased on Oculus will not be purchased on Steam.

This review comes from someone who has tried a bunch of VR headsets and owned a PCVR - Oculus Rift. I was a sceptic about it but wanted to see what the wireless freedom got me compared to PCVR. I will be getting a second one for multiplayer and getting rid of my original Rift.This is a game changer. If you are considering it, go for it. Everyone I have introduced this to in the last week has said they are buying one. The ease of use and wireless really out way any of the (small) cons. The quality of games is much better than I anticipated. My 11 Year old son and 5 Year old daughter use it like crazy. You put it on and within seconds you are in VR and launching whatever game/app you want. Oculus knocked it out of the park with this one.I added a battery pack to it to extend playtime. It charges while playing and we got about 5 hours total out of it while we had a bunch of people over sharing it.

I don't even know where to begin. This Virtual Reality Headset is top of the line. Anybody looking for more freedom in virtual reality will enjoy the guardian boundary (similar to Steam's Virtual reality boundary). The tracking has gotten much better in the past update bringing tracking to be more reliable and accurate. The lower refresh rate (in comparison to other headsets) does not decrease the immersion you will enter. I've gone hours at a time playing vr simply because I was so immersed and lost track of time. Games like Beat Saber will not have issues tracking as long as your hands aren't behind your back for too long.Some cons:1. The slightly smaller game library may put off some people, but many game developers are introducing their games to sideloading through sidequest.2. Oculus has been denying many developers from their store library for some reason. Games like Pavlov VR were denied resulting in them being forced to use sidequestPros:1. Incredibly immersive, and fun2. PC VR streaming is possible after jumping through a few very small hoops3. Ease of use. This headset can easily be moved from one place to another and set up within 30 seconds.4. Great way to spend time with family and friends. Although you will have to purchase (if not already owned) a Google Chromecast 3rd gen or newer.

You can sideload a ton of additional apps and even stream PC VR games to the headset! I wasn't expecting this functionality when purchasing, but it works great if you have a good PC and network capable of handling the data (5ghz AC router recommended)I got Skyrim VR, Space Pirate Trainer, Google Earth and Rez Infinite working via PC streaming. The apps available in the Quest store are good as well, though may be lower fidelity than the PC version. I'd personally recommend Beat Saber, Superhot and Vader Immortal

Minus the way Facebook scumbagged the games forcing you to only be able to play games from their store, even going so far as making Virtual Desktop remove the ability to stream games specifically off of Steam. The headset itself is great, but the downside you may find is the games are smaller scales of the original. They left that out entirely before launch as well. Those factors aside the headset is still wonderful at what it does. You can play anywhere and my kids absolutely LOVE their game time. Some titles are cross play from the Rift, some, not all. Also more reason to purchase from the Oculus store. I will check if titles are cross play before I purchase them. Sometimes it requires a little hunting since they havent quite thought ahead to put that in an easy to find spot every time. Half rambling probably but I do highly recommend for the kids or yourself if you don't have a decent PC for a Rift.

Absolute Garbage! I have nothing good to say about the Oculus Quest all in one VR headset. From the moment I received this, it was a headache. The headache didn't go away until I sent it back. No, wait, it's still there. Caused by just the thought of it.I'll start this rant with its weight. It weights 1.5 POUNDS! Way too much for anyone's comfort. You the consumer will have to spend at least an additional $150 dollars to make it comfortable enough to wear for just a short period of time. Then, the odor! Something in its materials just absolutely stinks. That alone made me want to puke.The software is nothing more than a means for Facebook/Oculus to gather information about you, or any person whom uses the headset, to tailor their ads and slap you in the face with it. Its buggy, it lags, its choppy. My list of negative adjectives goes on for days.MAKE NOTE OF THIS: If you are a Simmer, ie: you play simulation games such as Digital Combat Simulator or Microsoft Flight Simulator, this is not the VR headset for you. STAY AWAY! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS HEADSET! The effort, work and software that MUST be downloaded/sideloaded to get the headset to work in those environments is monumental. Definitely not a ""plug and play"" device.Lastly Facebook/Oculus, DO NOT reply to MY review with your corporate ""contact our customer service/support, we'll be happy to help you"". It will be nothing more than confirmation that you manufactured a (add your own expletive here) product that serves your purpose and not those of your customers.

I love how Oculus Quest is an all in one device without PC, i've always wanted to be able to port my VR headset everywhere.I was an original owner of the OG vive and still love it, but now i can bring a more portable headset without having to lug around 2 base stations, 2 controllers, a bunch of wires, and a laptop/PC for its use.The cost is like purchasing a console, i see no downsides except that i have to repurchase games that I want to share when porting it around.

Hello, i have that great device, but I'm not happy coz they ignored only Quest for some -% summer discuss. I have only one VR devise and Oculus just not add some sales for my own device. Now i don't want to buy any apps from the store coz they just ignore my device and i don't want to buy the game for Rift and again for Quest! This is the same game, why i should buy it two times? Also, not a lot of games for Quest and price is near 30$ and without any sales!+Two stars only for the great and stable Quest device, -three is for greedy marketing.

I experienced VR the first time a couple of years ago, but the system required a high powered computer to run it. The Oculus Quest is a stand alone VR headset, operates on its own, no other equipment needed. The VR experience is very good, although I'm a relative newby, so I'm not really an expert. Lots of games/apps are available as demo downloads and you get a real good idea whether or not you want to spend the money on the full version. A little spendy, but a huge jump up from the Oculus Go, from what I've read. Go for it!

My son has thoroughly enjoyed his Oculus Quest since mid-August of 2020.  Games have been fun, overall VR experience is very good.  However.  The headset lost video mid-March and customer service is abhorrent.  No phone number to contact, emails go days before a response is received.  We have determined that the unit needs replacement, however I'm unable to receive any response from Oculus on my issue.

I don't think I've ever purchased an electronic gaming gadget that I've enjoyed as much as I had the Quest.  The quality of the display is unreal.  The sound is outstanding.  It takes a little getting used to wearing it, but that actually happens pretty quick.  As for learning how to use the controllers and playing the games that comes very fast.  I've found myself running the battery down a couple of times playing games while sitting, but that's actually a good thing, it makes me take a break from it.

I bought the very first Samsung Gear VR years ago for use with the Galaxy Note 5 and was amazed then at the technology. I hated the lack of controllers at the time and the screendoor effect which ruined the visual aesthetic when watching Netflix or any video content.Cut to many years later and I decided out of curiosity how much VR technology has evolved. I'm really pleased with the Oculus Quest. The software feels much more polished and smoother. More immersive which is the main point of VR, and I absolutely love the controllers.The screendoor effect is still there and noticeable but definitely improved upon. Watching Netflix or 4K video content is actually enjoyable now. People have complained about the weight and lack of comfort while wearing the Quest but I find it okay. Took a little while to adjust the velcro straps but I am able to wear for a couple of hours without any real discomfort. I guess this will be an issue for some and not for others.Apps wise there are some good offerings on there at launch but very little free content. Expect to pay between $9.99 to $24.99 but there are a few free trials to help decide whether a game or app is right for you. The battery does roughly last as long as the advertised 2 to 3 hours depending on your usage. Gaming burns through the battery a lot quicker obviously. I like the long charging cable which let's you continue to play while charging. There is also an adapter if you wear glasses included in the box.The software requests that you mark out your playing area and does so with the camera sensors. This is genius and stops you from walking into walls or furniture. It also highlights where you have placed the controllers and its then easy to pick them up. The controllers feel ergonomic and intuitive. It takes a little while to get used to the button mapping but you'll be picking up objects in no time.Looking forward to playing with the Quest more over the coming weeks and excited to see what upcoming games and apps will become available.In short, this wont be for everyone and maybe a little too gimmicky and expensive for the very casual VR fan, but this finally feels like how VR was originally intended and is a great experience.

One of the coolest things I’ve played with in my life. Personally I have a computer and I rarely use it in mobile mode. I am a very big VRchat fan and have always wanted to play with my friends in vr. It really has changed my life and is absolutely one of the best purchases I’ve made.In a quick summary of the product -Fun as just a standalone headset and am impressed by what it can do by itself, but I find it A lot more fun with the link. If I go to my friends house I’ll bring my computer with me to run it. Just because I want the little extra kick of seeing people’s avatars in VRChat WHICH  is all I play. I’ve played a few other free titles on the quest alone and they are pretty fun

You talk to people all around the world. Any you-tube that has a VR label watch them. You will not be disappointed. The price for the app games are reasonable priced. You have in your library forever. Chat rooms have some really interested people that have a lot of knowledge about computers. Worth every penny!.  T.D.

This product failed after several months of use.  The company provides no means of contact besides a customer support email address.  Response to inquiries is typically no response or ""check back later.""  Customer support instructed us to return it for repair after several attempts to reset and update software. Item was replaced with a unit which was defective on arrival.  We were given a return label to ship back the second unit.  The return was apparently lost in shipment.  The companies response was ""check back later.""  This has continued for going on two months. I contacted UPS and was told the shipment was lost, but I have no recourse since Oculus is their customer. I contacted Oculus with the information and Oculus' response for the past several weeks has been ""check back later.  The company apparently has no interest in making this right.

We've had fun taking turns playing games while casting to the TV.  A friend of mine has the HTC Vive, and honestly I couldn't tell the difference in how it looked in-game.  Admittedly the games in the Oculus store are less graphic intensive than the ones on Steam.  As an entry level VR setup, it's totally worth the money, and the 64GB has been more than enough for us so far.  With the latest updates (and the use of a USB-C to USB-C cable and a computer that meets the specs) you can use the Quest as a Rift, so it's really two in one!

Oculus has done a fantastic job of providing a totally new experience at a reasonable cost. The device is intuitive and exciting to use. Even the tutorial on using the controls is a fun experience in a virtual world ranging from launching throwing paper airplanes to launching hand held rockets to controlling a blimp through virtual remote controls. Whether you want to learn Tai Chi in an interactive session or box a virtual opponent or playing an addictive light sabre game, this device brings it all. I bought the 64GB device and have not found any limitations.

This was a Christmas present for my son and I cant stop playing it, except to write this. Easy to set up and get right to it. Connecting it to Steam was a bit of a challenge but there is an additional purchase that allows you to mirror your computer on to the Oculus BUT we needed to purchase the additional cord to do that; that is the only draw back. Other than that it is amazing, awesome, and I'm going to get one for myself.

These are a lot of fun. If you are familiar with how cumbersome VR headsets used to be, what with all the cables and weight, so these (and Quest 2) are a breath of fresh air. They are fast enough for the types of games that run on them. Just make sure you have a lot of room around you, otherwise you might damage the controllers and/or your arms and legs.

I’ve been using my Quest daily for almost a week now and I am completely blown away by what Oculus has achieved here. Everything worked flawlessly roughy out of the box (tracking, setup, sound, etc.) The graphics have wowed me despite this being a mobile chipset and the sensation of presence is extraordinary. Comfort could be improved but this is mainly due to the weight of the device. Battery lasts a satisfyingly long time and it can still be played while charging if necessary.

I've been waiting to get this for a while. Yes, the games are fun. But for me, it's the videos. Since I'm home so much from the pandemic, it's nice to just pop this on and take a trip to the beach. Plus my friend has one so we can play games together and do rec room, and get on a call via the headset while in it. The visual quality is a lot better than I anticipated as well.Yes, it could be a little lighter, but they are working on that. And, I get a little motion sick in some videos, but I have motion sickness in general. Nothing too bad though, it's barely noticeable unless I play for a while.Definitely one of my best buys of 2020 (not including toilet paper and sanitizer :p)

Im a game developer and this was the best VR hardware I have used. The cable-less factor is a huge relief. It’s worth the compromise in performance. Also the resolution and frame rate are satisfactory but I believe in the future clarity and blurriness from hardware limitations will eventually be significantly better. Ideally a retina quality high resolution display with no optical magnification for pixels would be great but I doubt it’s possible without a tether and high end gpu anytime soon.

I'm 42 and grew up on gaming devices like Atari, NES, Playstation, got a Switch a couple years ago, etc. As I've gotten older, I've gotten away from playing video games often. I've had the Quest now for close to a month and my son and I are having a blast with it. I would recommend watching some YouTube videos on certain games if you're hesitant on what to buy. But it is such a good time. Definitely recommended for places with plenty of room to move around. I have a small play area, but have managed to make it work. It is pricey.

Yes, the resolution might be low, yes, the graphic aren’t good compared to the PC-powered VR headsets. But damn is everything else is so close to perfection. Most of the people giving low scores are people that have already experienced VR with powerful PC’s connected to them that cost thousands of dollars, so it’s not really a fair comparison.

Its great, and the Oculus LINK (beta) makes this the headset over the Rift S to have. Just really hate that the Quest store is seperate from the Rift S store and SteamVR... But with the link cable, I can play Rift and SteamVR games no problem! Oculus needs to include the cable with this headset... paying extra for it is really lame.Controllers are good, but the battery covers keep sliding off. Tracking will fail if you play at night (or during the day) in a dark room, so you have to have plenty of light for the inside-out cameras to properly track things.

Prior to buying this I had little experience using a VR headset but really wanted to get into them. A friend suggested getting this one as a start into the VR world. It has been great! The versatility of the quest is awesome. The one downside is that there are pc VR games I would like to play but as of now I haven't been able to because you can only play what is on the quest store. However, if you side load games and other content, it makes the quest so much better. I have not tested out the new link capabilities that allow PC VR games to be played. Overall if you are wanting to get into VR and don't have a super nice computer to run the rift or other headsets, the quest is for you!

Battery shipped with Oculus quest leaked in the controller which now does not work. Support says they will have someone contact me instead of just sending a new one. Kids are beyond disappointed as it was their xmas present which now they have to wait a week or two at best to use. Support was horrible about this and would not overnight a new controller so I'm returning. Update, right controller battery is also leaking. Oculus has no phone number so you have to wait until they contact you. Imagine the disappointment for what could be a simple fix e.g. overnight a controller.

We have been playing for about an hour exploring its feature as we are totally new to VR. Initial impressions barring unfamiliarity are that its amazing. The experience is immersive and honesty I'm in to it way more than I thought I would be. Youtube VR was great as well as several other free games and apps we've tried so far. Controller tracking is spot on and they are fairly intuitive to use, headset is comfortable but there is a slight gap by the bridge of the nose where light bleeds through. I haven't fully adjusted it for size as it was exitedly being passed between 3 different people.

The oculus quest is a fine piece of equipment for its time.I like the concept of drawing the available area to walk in VR and the headset warning you visually when you're about to cross that boundary. The VR immersion is very good as long as you can actually walk to reach your objective, but immersion breaks a little when you have to teleport to a place further away. The field of view is advertised to be around 90 degrees, however in practice it is a bit less, because the headset is a bit finicky to adjust such that the picture in front of you is not blurry, and even with the best adjustment edges are still blurry. Additionally, pixel density on the screen is not high enough, so that one can clearly see all the pixels. They would have to increase pixel density 10 times to make it barely acceptable, and 100 times to make it decent. This is why I rate it 4 stars instead of 5. Nevertheless, if you imagine that you are looking at the VR world through glasses that have been touched a lot by fatty fingers which makes the image blurry, and the glasses have a fine black grid built in that make the picture pixelated, your brain will be able to extrapolate what the actual experience not mangled by the glasses should look like and you will be able to enjoy the VR experience a lot nevertheless.

I'm 78 years old and had never used VR before and was pleasantly surprised by the wide variety of interesting 360 degree content and its realism. I'm way past ""shoot-em-up"" games but I'm enjoying Bowling, Tennis, Ping Pong, Golf, visits to various cities around the world, Outer Space, climbing Mount Everest, etc., as well as Beat Saver and Racquet NX. My only disappointment so far has been Google Earth. While fascinating to use at a distance, when you get down to street level I expected to see a 360 degree photo of the streets being viewed but, instead, found what appeared to be painted cardboard mockups of each building. I don't think they are, that would have required an enormous effort, but that is what they look like. The headset is as advertised. Very good.

Product is fine. Works well, amazes people in my family, even those non-gamers. However, Oculus actively preventing game developers from offering discounts really pisses me off. While I do not expect a sale like Steam sales, but at the very least, allowing developers to offer discounts will be reasonable. However, Oculus wants to milk early users as much as they can, and they prevent any discounts on any games on the Oculus Quest. My Quest has been lying dormant for a few weeks due to the lack of discounts on games. Yes, I am price-sensitive on games and would appreciate some form of sales/discounts from time to time as the costs of the full price games will add up over time, considering the short length of the games plus this is not my only gaming system. Therefore, I can only give up to 3 stars at this time due to the attitude of Oculus.

So much fun! Been waiting for something like this. It’s going to get better in the future but it is darn good now. Room scale means you can really work up a sweat. I clocked in at 120-130 bpm playing games like Pistol Whip or Creed. Some games are more mellow. Some games fail to live up to a promise of entertaining game play (drunken bar fight made me laugh more thinking about playing it but was a disappointment). Games are affordable. If you play less than 2 hours you can get a full refund. So, if you’ve been holding out to try VR when it is affordable, supported, and accurate this is it. Jump in!

Is the screen and tracking as good as the Index, probably not, But the index isn't wireless and to me that is the biggest game changer in VR to this point, Cables suck. Have a second PSVR because my cat decided to chew through my first one's cable, Another good reason not to have a cable, lol.

If you've got $400 for a VR headset, but dont have a $1500 desktop to plug into, this is the way to goThe games library is a little small, and games are relatively expensive for how short they are, but there are new ones being added all the time as well as some really great renditions of triple A VR titles.Overall, you probably wont play this every day, or even every week.

I love this little VR unit and I hope they make it lighter in the future. On the first day of opening the Quest, everything worked wonderfully. A few hours later and one battery recharge I noticed static and breaking of the sound in the right speaker like it had been blown out. I was super disappointed and tried another game and the same thing. I plugged in some headphones and it worked perfectly. I went back to the built-in speaker and the same issue. About 30 minutes later I started another game and everything was magically fixed! I went back to the other games where I heard the staic and distortion and it was also magically not there! My only guess is there is a loose connection somewhere in the headset.

The only reason I bought the quest is because it's currently one of the few VR headsets that can boast true wireless pcvr gaming but this is coming at a cost. Build quality is awful and the controllers are made of cheap plastic that's easy to break and you will likely experience controller drift within the first few months/weeks (get that customer service line ready and expect a lot of bulls**t) also the headset frequently bugs out and losses the environment so you constantly have to retrace your playspace (entirely a software issue and one that actually was introduced in the last few months). I hate the oculus itself, the company behind it, and the company behind oculus and the only reason this thing exists is because nobody else has bothered to make a wireless headset yet.

I have always been enthusiastic about the applications of VR, but do not have a good gaming PC set-up. The quest is a great headset providing the capability in experiencing virtual reality on a budget. Still has 6 DOF and many other great features including the ability to use it with your PC for better performance. Although not much is sacrificed in terms of performance since games through the store have been ported over directly for the quest. All in all I love it and have been able to introduce 5 people to VR over the weekend, all who had a great experience.Cons: slightly front heavy. Battery only lasts for 2-3 hours.Solution: Mount an external battery to the back of the headset. This will act as a counter weight and provide longer sessions.Seller Specific: Product was ordered through Endear direct. They sent me the wrong order and immediately realized and sent a RMA. Incorrect product was recieved on Saturday and mailed back the same day. The correct product was received the following day approximately 24 hours later. Great seller.

This is a good product for newcomer of VR player like me. Wireless experience is essential for VR gaming and cinema, though the resolution is not so great as blur is very common on most of the apps. The battery is another concern for hardcore user like me, 1 hour of PokerVR or 2 hours of BeatSaber for maximum, it depends on the apps you play.Despite the aforementioned problems, Oculus is walking towards the right direction for future development of VR, it would be a dreaming gear for introducing new guys to VR if only there is better resolution and battery duration.

The Oculus Quest is a fantastic device that nearly nails the VR experience. The controller tracking and head tracking are nearly flawless. The graphics, although not what you'll get with a high-end PC, hold up surprisingly well and don't negatively impact the experience for most games. The resolution, one the the most important metrics for immersion, is impressively high for a stand-alone device. Exploring 3D spaces untethered from a computer provides a level of freedom and immersion you can't get on a traditional VR headset. It's hard to express how good this product is for the price. Buy it, show it to your friends, and fall in love with virtual reality. You will not be disappointed.

Plus side: No cables. That's really great and a huge sense of freedom.Cons: The focal distance is NOT adjustable. If your natural focus length is not the average that they build this device for (mine is about 3 mm out) then using this is guaranteed to cause a headache very quickly.Even if the focal distance is perfect for you, the resolution and refresh rate is very low compared to a wired headset.

I was having fun with it for 2 and a half months then the right controller kept spinning out of control. The customer supports only suggestion was that I wrap a rubber band around it and if that doesn't work ask other users what to do. First of all nothing 3 months old should need rubber bands wrapped around it to hold it together or get it to work properly.  second, what kind of customer support is telling you to essentially go ask people that don't get paid to do your job for you. At the end she said ""this tends to happen with beat saber and other games/apps where a swift motion is made"". Those are the games that they are most heavily promoting( beat saber, Vader immortal 1-3) $400 is alot of money for something to work less than 3 months

It has only been a few weeks and we have two more.The roomscale set up easy and amazing been playing in my garage with so much room. Been walking around in superhot. I have played almost all launch titles. By buying and testing them out then returning the one i didn’t care for. All of them play pretty good accept boxvr something felt off in that. The tracking is pretty good it gets lost behind your back if you move to slow in some games, or move it to close to your own face. I have not had any problems with the vr slipping off of my face. Now the controllers are awesome love the joysticks the tracking in most games picking up and throwing things feels great. I did have battery case open on me one time in beat saber but other than that they are awesome.  Now the things that stink short battery life on the headset mostly 2 hrs. Then the controllers they take two aa batteries. So you have too buy those every once and a while. The speakers on it are ok I like my head phones better but they add a wire to get choked by. Some games cost a lot wait for sales I hope.Great games to get if you only want to spend 100 more bucksBeat saber 29.99Superhot  24.99 I thinkVader  9.99Creed  29.99

If you are a basic Vr user and you do not expect to competitively play, then this system is for you. If you already own the PSVR you will notice that the tracking for the oculus quest is EXTREMELY subpar in comparison. I am almost top ten in EVERY beat saber song in PSVR and found that I cannot come close to my scores due to lag and tracking issues.Next, the controllers. If you move too fast or grip too hard the magnetic backing will easily come off. I also found myself hitting the “home” button anytime things get too crazy in game.Again, if you want to max out the capabilities of a system this NOT the system for you.

I bought this for my 9 year old and he loves it! I had an issue when I forgot my password to the app. Resetting it causes you to have to re-pair the headset but its touchy. Took me a little while to get it working again. Also, the batteries in the hand controls only lasted about 4 hours. Make sure you have replacements close by. My brand new batteries have lasted longer than what came in the box so I'm guessing they were just cheap batteries. In the grand scheme of things, not a big deal. If you can afford the VR, you can afford AA batteries. The phone app is easy to use. Games are more expensive than I expected but my son really enjoys them and they seem to take a while to play so he gets his money's worth.

As someone that has always been interested in virtual reality, this finally convinced me to take the leap. While I had a computer that could support VR before, I did not want to do that because my computer is upstairs and it would be difficult to take with me when visiting family. The all in one set up from the Quest makes it mobile and I can play anywhere in the house. It is not as powerful as the rift, so the game selection is a little bit more limited, but many of the main titles are available, including Beat Saber (the main reason I wanted VR).

AMAZING!!!!! I bought another one because my boys love it just as much! If your a sports fan....boxing,baseball,  football basketball etc.  this is a must own! The facial interface is very, very uncomfortable and prohibited extended use but we ordered an AMVR facial interface and it helps tremendously! The battery life could be better to but if your play or watching something that doesn't require you to move around we just keep it plugged in while we are wearing it. There is also a battery pack that I seen people using when they are not near any power source and they say it extends the battery for 2 to 4 hours doubling the usage time.

Good product essentially. I'll have had three total now. One for me, then that one replaced due to my damaging it, and then one for my wife. My only real complaint is they made the lenses out of plastic. Not just any plastic, but stick soft plastic that if you blow dust across it it'll scratch.  Probably not that bad, but they do scratch VERY easily.

This is my teens favorite gaming system, even more than PS4.  He likes it most because he can play with friends that don't have the quest but are playing on their PS4.  They can see him on their tv and he can see them on his quest.  Nice to see it still getting this much use 8 months later still.  The controllers are still holding up too.  Our Nintendo Switch controllers were already replaced by this time.

First off, love this headset.Pros: portability, full mobility, more than surprisingly solid tracking of both position and controllers. This headset has a surprisingly similar feel to the PC version than to a mobile headset. Reasonable battery life and solid frame rate.Cons: Slightly more front heavy than I'm used to compared to other headsets, this disappears after awhile. In low light you can occasionally lose tracking, but it's highly uncommon. No current way to know your exact IPD adjustment, so some guesswork required.

But clicking on the""ok"" is not working.  I turned the machine off, and then states, ""power off"", and that the controller is not connected.

I've only had this Oculus Quest for two weeks. As you can see in the pictures there is a blur in the center of the eye pieces. One picture depicts camera off and one on. I can't seem to get a straight answer from Oculus if this is a flaw in my VR set. When I view items that are suppose to be in 4k, it's far from it. For the most part I love the Quest but I need answers as to the blur.

Couldn't be happier with how this turned out. The battery life is quite impressive and the controllers are easily the best VR controllers out there, they feel so ergonomic and tailored for any application in the medium. The external speakers are also quite good and a nice forethought. Only complaints could be the controllers run on AA batteries and you have to sell your soul to Zuckerberg to utilize the service but otherwise this is definitely going to move the VR medium forward!

This is the first virtual reality headset that captivated me enough to buy it . I played the first DK1 when it came out and saw the potential but it was too early . Screen door effect was way too bothersome . Now this is a standalone headset running on a cellphone processor and can provide amazing VR experiences? I’m in . The screen is great quality and they are releasing a feature soon to be able to connect to a gaming pc to run games from there. Honestly the best VR experiences for the price . Definitely not a valve index but at a 3rd of the price it destroys it in value for your money.

Managed to place the order when the quest was in huge demand and finally got the order after nearly 3 weeks of waiting. Guess the virus is putting a huge strain on manufacturing and logistics. Noticed that there is a dead pixel on the left eye. I really don't want to return it now and wait for an eternity to get a replacement, moreover it's hardly visible except in dark loading screens.The quest is a pretty great VR product that can operate as a standalone headset and can also be tethered to a gaming pc for some serious VR stuff.

I grew up playing the original NES and was fanatic about video games up until the Xbox 360. I got older, responsibilities mounted, and I had lost interest. I still kept up with the tech, but honestly I was mostly interested in the academics of it. I tried an HTC vive at a fun center and was impressed enough to go out and buy a VR headset. The team at Oculus nailed it; I mean, they absolutely nailed it. The games are incredibly immersive, and there are many educational apps as well. I feel like a kid again. I’m building a new computer so that I can take advantage of the higher graphics and games exclusive to the oculus rift (by using the oculus link cable). It is shocking that you can get this kind of tech for $400.

No tethered headset can compare to the pure freedom the Quest offers. Simply turn it on and jump back in wherever you left off. VR was never about graphics, it's about the freedom to immerse yourself in another world. It's about the freedom to play games that are physically impossible. It's about the freedom to watch Netflix on an IMAX size screen. They are squeezing more out of this processor than I thought possible. The games Oculus allow into the store have a high bar to jump and I agree with their ""only the best"" approach.Obviously you can't compare the Quest's computing power to a gaming PC, but who wants to turn one on, let alone be tethered to it! Nevertheless, the screen is excellent and you can only marvel that they are squeezing so much out of the same processor as the Samsung S8. I think when historians look back, the Quest will be seen as the first real VR headset.Freedom and immersion to explore world we can only imagine. That's what we always wanted from VR. Quest delivers.

This is about good a time as ever to submit a review for Oculus' wireless VR headset. I absolutely love this thing. I purchased this Janurary 29th, and in just one month I lost 20 pounds from over 120 hours of workouts in various apps such as Beat Saber and Super Hot. This being said, I believe a hardware issue has developed. It seems that after an brief time of playing, both controllers lose their tracking and float in space. It makes playing certain games rather difficult and frustrating. I heard Oculus support was rather not up to standard, and I have tried many different solutions to try and fix the issue. From a consumer standpoint the product is amazing, if the hardware remains operable.

I’ve played the hottest on the quest, from super hot and pistol whip, to Vader Immortal chapter one, and throughout all of my games it has run smooth with little to no errors. The only complaint I have is that due to the system limits, the games don’t have very good graphics and are very short. I definitely recommend buying this if you aren’t in the mood to spend like $700 more for a pc+rift system.

If you have never experienced VR before this is the perfect introduction. the quality of the craftsmanship and the range of games will draw you into the emerging world of VR. If you are worried about motion sickness the games and apps are rated to give you a comfort level in order to build up you VR ""legs"".  You can start of with something like Wander which essentially drops you into Google street view so you can be on the Mattehorn while sitting on your couch. Then you can work your way up to more fully immersive and vertigo inducing games such as Climb where you are a rock climber actually climbing virtual mountains and the drop is stomach wrenchingly  realistic.I highly recommend this to anyone even remotely interested in VR

This feels revolutionary first time I used it I was so flustered it’s just incredible to see how far technology has come.Draw back the quest lacks processing power to run high end games but they are making a way to connect the quest to your laptop or computer to run them soon.I don’t recommend it for kids cause the stuff is delicate in the sense that it’s all hard plastic and not very reinforced like the controllers so if they drop something will likely become damaged.Keep a mental note that all the tables you see are fake don’t try to lean on one 😂Edit: the games aren’t diverse and because the quest doesn’t have a way to connect to a pc yet it’s enjoyment is heavily limited.

Old school gamer and this is my first time trying VR I've been completely blown away at the immersion. I bought the quest because I didn't want to invest thousands into upgrading my pc and buy a headset not knowing if I'll even like it. I'm completely happy playing the quest I had no clue how good VR is. Watching youtube vids does not do the experience justice it really is incredible...

This headset is a game changer. The Oculus quest brings all of the fun and joy of VR and takes it to a new level. Unencumbered by wires, you're able to freely play in your VR world without breaking immersion due to a cord getting in the way. This affordable alternative to the Rift or Vive is where everyone should start with VR. 1000% recommend!

I own a PSVR and a quest and I can tell you that quest is not comfy but it's more convenient to use due to :1) stand-alone (you don't need a PC/console to run it) and2) no wire is needed.Saying that expect to get a VR face (just google how it will leave marks on your face) due to the flaw of the design. This can be overcome by adding weight (like it doesn't need more weight) or using vive deluxe audio strap ($100). Saying all that I still love my quest and hope the future release overcome this issue.PS: if you got one you might want to get AMVR grip for controllers

Returned after using for a few hours as I could sense the addictive power of this technology. I have no doubt that VR is the opioid of the future. People will crave their their virtual world just like addicts crave painkillers today. Young and old will spend endless hours detached from reality, isolated from each other. Governments and society will eventually realize that a technology-induced dopamine kick is no different than chemically-induced one. Efforts to regulate will be too little too late, as VR will have permeated every facet of our lives and Oculus (Facebook) will have monopolized people's virtual identities.

The oculus quest is a very good VR experience.Playing games like robo recall and beat saber is a ton of fun.On the downside, the quest come with a very basic rubber head strap that is not very comfortable.The device is front heavy, if you attached a counter weight on the back like a power bank it will improve the comfort a lot.Overall it's a great buy, be prepared to do some mods to improve it.

Truly the next step in VR.  Can be worn on its own and played anywhere, or tethered to a gaming PC so you can play more demanding games.  Sadly, if you already have a VR library, you have to repurchase your games for this device.  The screen has a low refresh rate, which led to motion sickness for me (though it might not for you).  If you are wanting to get into VR, I cannot think of a better device.  But if you already have a gaming PC with an established VR library (and don't feel like buying all your games a second time), the Rift S is an excellent alternative.

Not as comfortable as the Playstation VR headset by far. I had to purchase extra padding for the straps but it was a cheap fix. I feel like Oculus offers more and better content than the PS4 though and I love that it is wireless.

I love it, played over 200 hours total and its great, a few minor issues I had with it solved with a bit more money.1. Super front heavy - nothing a sweatband streched over the head cant solve, and there are many very affordable solutions and others more expensive and more comfortable.2. The built-in face cover is terrible, no way around that, it hurts the skin and absorbs sweat way too much which makes it very unhygienic, the solution for me was a different face cover from ""vrcover"" which is a kind of leather cover, much softer and nicer on the skin and absobs zero sweat wich makes it very easy to clean.Other than that its fantastic and if you're willing to spend some time on learning how to sideload which is quite easy now, you can do a lot of great things with this!

I was pairing the Quest with the Oculus App and all of a sudden the Quest started updating itself and I can no longer pair it again with the App, not until I switch it off for more than 15mins. (switch off and turn it back on immediately did not work)I thought everything is ready since I can finally pair it with the Oculus App but here come with the Wifi issue. The Quest keeps dropping out (and unpair with the App) and cannot search for any networks so I am pretty sure it is not about weak wifi signal as I saw nothing on the Quest. Googled it and saw quite a lot of people having the same issue. I have already submitted a support ticket to Oculus and I hope they could return a new device to me and bear the shipping cost.

What matters is that there is now a VR device that provides unbelievable experiences without being tethered to another device. Without the need of a 500$ PC or a 300$ console attached to it.Between the technology - the 6DoF, the tracking, the controllers - and the games - Robo Recall, Beat Saber, etc. - this is a fantastic entry point for those interested in VR.

As far as vr headsets go, I have to say this is currently the best by far. The ability to not have a computer and cables alone is worth it. Not to mention the fact of price or stock fit. The headset is great for someone getting into vr that doesn't want the burden of needing a new computer or for someone that doesn't want to have to setup lighthouses. I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone and everyone. Plus, if you still want to use it with your pc you can thanks to the oculus link update!

Boy was I totally wrong. This thing is awesome. It's like having PC VR anywhere anytime. No wires or computer required. Definitely took me by surprise that VR could be this awesome without being tethered to a computer. Anyways, definitely would buy again, without a doubt.

Perfect VR headset. Works mobile, I can bring it to school, a friends house, etc. with no hassle. No cameras or sensors to set up, all in one headset. The hand tracking feature is amazing and I hope to see more games on this system soon. Highly recommended over PC connected VR Headsets. Extremely comfortable and the graphics are extremely well for the weight and ram. The memory is perfect since most games are under a GB anyway, and you can just uninstall unused games. Definitely the best VR experience I've had.

I had to return mine because it had a weird permanent glare in the lens, almost like a stain. It wasn’t very strong and obvious but it still irritated me. On the other hand, the screen was okayish for gaming but not so much for videos. The videos were grainy and since you see “god rays” around white text on the dark background it was hard to watch with subtitles. I’m giving it 4 because overall they made it possible to have a decent standalone VR experience and the tracking was great (anyone who played with older VR sets would agree). So overall I think it will not replace your game console or TV but it’s still good to have it and start experiencing this new technology.

A definite win for Oculus, they really knew what they were doing with the Quest. The controls, the graphics, the roomscale, everything is absolutely great. The only nitpick I have is the headset itself which is a little front heavy, meaning at times the headset may dig into your cheekbones and push against your forehead which will leave some marks and some soreness after playing for a while. The setup was quick and easy and I got right into playing within 10 minutes. If you've been looking for a VR headset and don't want to worry about the hassle of getting it setup, the Quest is the one for you. No regrets on purchasing.

I purchased a quest to try out the wireless experience for VR, and I already own a Oculus rift CV1 from 2016.  Considering this is about half as much as I paid for my original rift, and that this doesn't need a computer, I cant recommend it enough.  The only downside is the graphics quality.  The graphics are impressive considering they are running on mobile hardware, but they dont really compare to an expensive gaming PC, but that shouldn't be a surprise.  The tracking quality is probably better than my rift, and is similar to the HTC vive, from my experience.

Oculus Quest offers the VR experience everyone has been waiting for. While it sacrifices graphical fidelity in some parts, what it gets back in trade is an unrivaled level of freedom in VR gaming. The headset has a battery life of roughly 2 to 2 1/2 hours, which is pretty convenient because average gaming sessions in VR do not normally last that long. After owning this headset for about two months, I can easily that I am very satisfied with this product as my very first investment into VR gaming.

This headset is so good, its crazy. They've managed to pack a crazy amount of tech into such a small package, and it works so well. Its able to run all the killer apps and then some. SUPERHOT in particular is virtually identical to its P.C. counterpart. And the tracking is near flawless. If you already own a PSVR I would strongly recommend picking up a Quest. Also, you can do custom songs on beat saber. Also the lack of a cable makes every experience so much more immersive. 7/5, would recommend.

I now attract double the women that I used to before getting the headset (yes, I can make these claims because 2×0=0) ;)The problem I had with comfort when I first got it was easily solved with a headstrap from a random mobile vr headset I had laying around.

This is my first step in VR. After having it for over a month, I can say It is the perfect entry point for people who don’t have a powerful gaming pc/laptop or a ps4 for psvr. Since it’s a self contained unit, it’s perfect to take with you to show your friends and family whenever and wherever. Setup is easy and self explanatory, but you’ll probably need a teen or adult to assist children. The only draw backs that I’ve come across are the WiFi has trouble staying connected from time to time, the tracking can be slightly inaccurate at times, and its heavier than you’d think on your head.

Make sure to buy a link cable if you have a VR Ready PC.  This is probably my favorite buy of the year, I use it practically everyday, and if you are on the fence about buying this just take the plunge.  The quest is so much more than a gaming system, its hard to explain but everything in VR just feels more interactive and personal.  Want a big screen TV? The Quest can stream media and make you feel like you are at the cinema.  You can even watch media in a cinema setting with your friends in VR with an app, it's awesome.

Highly convenient when used as a stand-alone, just put it on and play!We’re only 7 days in and 3rd party PCVR streaming options such as ALVR are working impressively well (admittedly with the need for tweaking & optimising wifi connection between PC and headset). This almost makes wired sets like the Rift S redundant. Sure, latency will never be as low as wired, but visual quality with tweaked settings is breathtaking.I’ve found a good setup for ALVR is to have a dedicated wifi router (no other devices connected) next to my PC set to 5GHz with 80 MHz channel width (on a empty channel), then start a “mobile hotspot” from the PC and connect directly to that with the headset.

Therefore, I made a counterweight to solve the problem.2) I have to dry out the facial interface after taking off the headset (I sweat a lot while playing beat saber).

Dont get me wrong the Oculus quest is an amazing console for its price. Theres nothing like it. But thats what it is, a console, and if your not willing to constantly spend money for games on that console, then you can get bored of the games you do have. Other than that, the quest itself is amazing.

I am constantly hindered by bugs in the oculus HMI. I am sick and tired of being unable to access anything because my device refuses to access the internet, or open an app, etc. not only that, but being forced to integrate Facebook into my Oculus account is a huge turnoff.

Great product, smooth experience, great tracking of both head and controllers.Wire-free VR is fun and liberating.Graphics quality is borderline, due to the weak 835 processor, but I knew that before I ordered it. Luckily, it doesn't ruin the immersion, and many of the games are really cool (but sometimes a little too short and/or expensive).Quest is currently in a category of its own. There is no other affordable standalone wire-free VR headset in the market. It the best (and only) choice for entry to VR.

The oculus quest provides the a VR that was, until recently, only seen in science fiction.  The experiences you can have with this head set are beyond describable.  I have had previous experience using an HTC vive at the local vr arcade.  The experience is very comparable.  Some of the high end graphic games don't look as great in the quest but most of the games look almost the same  AND you're not tripping on chords.  The headset is a little heavy and adjusting the straps takes getting used to but overall the quest blew all my expectations out of the water.  It is truly an amazing piece of technology.

This product is way way better than I expected. I thought the graphics would be completely terrible, but they aren't. I thought the tracking wouldn't be that good, but it is pretty fantastic. I would say the biggest cons are 1. heavy on the face, but you can mitigate that by attaching a battery brick to the back of the headset. 2. the audio is good, but missing a bit of bass, and everyone around you can hear it. But you can get headphones, like the mantis ones for PSVR or use any 3.5mm headphones.

I don’t normally write reviews, but this thing is just so awesome that I had to. This headset is like the Nintendo Switch of VR right now. It doesn’t need a computer or wires, and it is completely standalone. The only drawback to this, is that the graphics aren’t as good as an oculus rift, or any other big setup VR headset. However, that is a given if you’re going to get a stand-alone, and I was prepared for that.

Bought as a Christmas gift for my son. He loves the device. So device is 5 stars. However, Oculus Customer Support is an endless loop. Online support chats disconnect and online support requests are not responded to in their stated 48 hour timeframe. 0 Starts for Oculus Customer Support - that gets me to the 2 star average. If you do not have a question for the support center or a problem with you device which needs support ---- this VR device is awesome.

I really enjoyed my quest.my computer isn't strong enough for PCVR, so the quest is great for me.I tried also my friend's Rift s, and out of the two I would recommend the quest, even for pcvr :the option for portability is nice,you cap paly pcvr games, WITH NO CABLES at all, (using virtual desktop for example).overall great product, but buy the quest 2 instead. 100$ cheaper, and better.

Simply AMAZING! Beat Saber is so much fun with no cables. Best option for social VR by far...invite friends and cast to the TV and have a blast. Plus...with the Link option you can be in rift mode.I can't recommend this enough...5 stars...no it deserves way more than 5 out of 5!!!Only thing...get a aftermarket facial interface as you will sweat in the original. Oh and the Party Link cable never worked for me, but a cheap Gizzu did.

The great thing about the Oculus Quest is the immersion you feel right off the bat. Younger kids like 12 and below are harder to teach and pick up on what to do. I have wasted much time trying to get them to even get going with Beat Saber, so save your time and tell them it for kids 14 and up. Otherwise it has been a very positive experience and a great workout. Can’t wait for more great games.

At $399 the Oculus quest has brought an AMAZING VR experience... My biggest worries getting into such a cheap VR headset was ""What if things are blurry or grainy?"", or ""What if it the sensors don't pick up anything because, maybe it's made cheap?"". Putting on and handling the quest blew me away. Visually it's impressive,  the games and apps all work great, and I've been going at beat saber since I got the thing! I highly recommend this product, and am very happy with all it has to offer.

Long story short if you are thinking of getting into a Oculus. Go for this, cheapest on the market and for paying more then the Oculus Go you get so many more worth while upgrades. Like the games you can get and the second controller for Saber beats. This console has been in my house for 3 months and a day hasn't gone by without it being played.

Amazon offers full refund but no replacement and the price has been raised considerably since i first purchased mine. Oculus,however, is sending me a new one once they receive the defective one.

This vr headset is amazing it is my first one and I'm happy that I waited. There are some down sides to the item but not that bad. For example the game store for it does not have a big verity of games but it will still be updating so it isn't something to dwell on. It can only play for about 2 hours and charge for 2 hours which is a bummer but it helps with breaks. I believe it is worth the money because you don't have to worry about a super computer and the cables on your back. All in all 10/10 would recommend

This thing is hot, uncomfortable, front heavy, low res, really low battery life, can see out of the nose area and the advertised 58 to 72 ipd is actually 59 to 71(I am a 58). I had it on for 30 minutes and could tell it was going back. I also have a rift s that is going back also because it has fixed lenses and out of my ipd range so everything is blurry, but besides that it is everything this is not.

My daughter is addicted to beat saber. So far she has cracked one of the rings on the controller from dropping it, nothing a little electric tape couldn't fix. I don't like not being able to have multiple accounts, but I got it for her so it's hers anyway. Some games have options for other players. Make sure you have room to play, it can be glitchy if you try an play the wrong kind of game in to small of a guardian area. Casting to a chromecast is the best thing ever, so others can watch.

As a Previous Go owner:Resolution is superb, games have better graphics. With Oculus link, you can play rift games. Screen-door effect lower than go but still a little visible. Controllers have good feature set.Strap is not comfy as go. Weight balance is not centered so you feel pressure around your cheeks.

Since the developers has decided to add a feature that allows users to use the headset on PC (Oculus Link), i just had to give this thing a better review.Probably the most notable downside is the weight of the headset on head, and might be quite uncomfortable for someone.

Drops wifi connection frequently, limited to the oculus store unless you sideload.  Additional weight makes prolonged play uncomfortable.  Otherwise pretty good.

The games are enjoyable with Beat Saber being my favorite.

For the money this system has been great. My only exposure to VR was a Samsung Gear headset. This blows it out of the water. Games are not overly pricey. The only downside is that you can not set up multiple profiles on the unit. One headset, one profile.

Bought this VR for my young son and for someone who isn’t into video games I have to say I am impressed with quality of this device. I’ve tested the Rift a few months before and this portable VR is almost as good as the Rift. For me, I like the Quest better because it is portable, no wires to trip on. I just wish there were more games appropriate for 6/7 year olds.

The Quest is an amazing device that makes VR within reach. The main problem is a lack of content. Im a believer and know its a matter of time for the developers to learn how to make great content for it. That being said, Beat Saber could last you a year of play, especially if you're using it to lose weight.

My son wanted a VR headset for his birthday so I convinced him to wait a few weeks to get the self contained Oculus Quest.  Boy am I glad he was understanding.  Not having to be tied down to a PC is great and the prices for games isn't as outlandish as I thought it would be.  Most of the games released with the Quest will run between $15-30 which isn't too bad considering Xbox/PS4 charge almost $60 for new games.  The graphics are great...just like if you were running one off of a PC.  Unless you have a tricked out PC, I would consider the Quest equal to other PC VR based headsets.  I really like that you can set a circle and if my son steps outside it, you can see the real world.  Hopefully that will mean, I won't hear objects crashing to the floor or him running into things.  I can't recommend the Oculus Quest enough.
