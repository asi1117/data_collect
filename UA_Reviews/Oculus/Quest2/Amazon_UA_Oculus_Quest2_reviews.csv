First time using VR and I must admit the quality is not as good as I thought it would be. I'm used to seeing crisp visuals from a 1440p monitor and this felt like I was looking at 720p. There's not many free applications/games and the good stuff is pay, but even those which should showcase this product were disappointing to me. I did feel quite nauseous after short periods depending on what I'm doing, but would continue to feel sick for the rest of the day. It is a cool experience but the novelty factor runs out very quick, and the dizziness was just not worth it for me. Comfort wise it was fine, the product is light on the head and comes with a silicon edge to help improve comfort. There's even a spacer for people with glasses. There's only 3 adjustments for eye spacing, and I felt like I was always seeing the edges of the screen no matter the settings. Text is blurry unless you're facing it directly, and I'm not sure if this is intentional or not. Graphics was disappointing to be as I could see jagged edges, lack of detail in objects and unrealistic lighting. The concept is cool but to me I expected the execution to be almost perfected after all these years, but I feel like it needs a few more. The speakers were nice but I used them on maximum volume. Battery life is enough, you will probably get dizzy before it runs out (2+ hours). Controllers are extremely responsive and probably the most impressive part for me. There's also a built in microprocessor to communicate with all the kids online. Shooting games were difficult for me as I felt I needed to close one eye to aim properly. I can't really recommend this product even though my friends recommended it to me. I will be returning mine.

I just recently bought it this week an have only used it twice. And I’m already facing joystick drift on my left controller. I’ve contacted oculus and they said it might be a software issue which it clearly isn’t. This is definitely a hardware issue. It is unacceptable and I wouldn’t recommend it as some games are barely playable

I purchased four of these devices as gifts for my family. However, one of the products had an issue with Bluetooth when purchased it stopped working I reset and it worked but now every time it stops working! I don't know how to make it work & the wifi is not working I reset the device twice with no luck!Oculus does not warranty the product in UAE.I asked them and they said I should send it to my address in supported countries for me to claim the warranty! They don't warranty it nor service it even though it is the most sold VR in the Middle East!However, Amazon returned the product and refunded it!Thanks Amazon!Shame on you Oculus, Facebook, Meta!!!!

I work a sitting office job and since I got Quest, I not only had a lot of fun and a steam valve to vent into, I also lost a few kilos just from playing games.Highly recommend, the experience is well worth $350.I’d also pick up Kiwi hand straps right away if you’re considering getting a quest, they are way more comfy than holding onto bare controllers

I love everything about this device and the whole community that backs it and makes it so worth it. the Biggest gripe i have is the lack of an IPD adjustment which wont come any time soon to the average consumer.All said and done, solid value for PCVR headset. For a standalone experience i wouldnt bother with. Not for me atleast but i can see the appeal.At this time the quest 2 is the best wireless PCVR experience you will have.

Due to all the extremely positive tests and reviews on YouTube, I ordered my very first VR glasses.The operation is extremely good, especially Air Link via WLAN, no latency, everything responds directly.Now for the big problem, the IPD (interpupillary distance).I see everything blurry, why? Because the maximum IPD is 68mm.So I measured my IPD, it is almost 74mm.I did not know that you have to pay attention to this, you assume that the developers have thought about it and calculated everything, especially such a banality. Only 5-6 milimeters more!Why do you do that ?I found on Reddit and other forums, very many users who have the same problem.What were the developers thinking, please ?Measure your interpupillary distance beforehand, if it is greater than 68mm, the VR is completely unusable for you.I hope with the Quest 3, the problem will be fixed.Now I have to send the VR expensive back from Germany.Thanks for nothing.Best regards.

The Quest 2 requires you to use your real name and photos via a Facebook account to use essentially a video game system.  This is beyond ridiculous.  I do not want to use Facebook.  I tried to create a dummy Facebook account and it suspended my account making me upload pictures of my face.  What the hell!!!  I just want to play some games.  Shame on Facebook.  Shame on Oculus.  Shame on the employees working there.  Shame shame shame.  I’ll be returning this.  This is why Facebook is a garbage company.

I think Facebook did a great thing with this ""new"" release of the quest 2. The headset itself feels quite nice, although the strap is definitely something to work on, it's way too front heavy. It's also extremely uncomfortable using glasses, unfortunately. Even with that said, the Oculus link feature was the only reason I bought this headset; and it's everything I could of asked for. My internet isn't even that good, all it needed was my laptop to be connected by ethernet for a smooth, high quality PCVR experience that I could take ANYWHERE IN THE HOUSE! I only had slight lags and stutters, but that's likely just my mediocre hardware. I'm a bit bummed by the comparably smaller control scheme compared to something like the vive.If you really want to have the best experience with this headset though, then don't put away that wallet just yet. At the very least, a new strap would be optimal, and I'd stay away from the first party elite strap. A new face cover might be good for you as well, as the default foam cover isn't the best for everyone.Overall, this headset is a great step in the right direction for vr tech. Although, out of the box, it should be subject to some modifications; which some could call a feature.One more thing, don't worry about the whole Facebook account thing. If you're fine with using whatsapp or Instagram, this shouldn't be a problem either. It's not like Facebook with Oculus is a new thing either, as Facebook has owned Oculus for 7 years now.Edit: after about a month of use, this headset has now become the most annoying piece of tech I own. The one feature I bought this for (Airlink) is straight garbage over half the time, im spending more time trying to fix this failure than I am actually using it. Connection hilariously unstable over ethernet with completely random performance drops. So both an unstable and sometimes unplayable experience that I paid 300 dollars for.

El visor es muy bueno para lo que cuesta. El precio real debería rondar entre 6000-6200 pesos. Sin embargo, para ser un precio mexicano se me hace entendible por la tarifa de importación.Ahora sí viene lo bueno: La experiencia. Es un visor de realidad virtual que demuestra calidad desde el unboxing, tal vez lo único criticable desde mi perspectiva sería la banda de la cabeza, pero se entiende totalmente porque oculus vende la correa elite por separado. La banda de cabeza no es incómoda, simplemente no va de acuerdo a la calidad percibida del producto en general, simplemente si puedes comprar la elite o una genérica, entonces sería lo mejor que puedes hacer.La experiencia de juegos es simplemente irreal, sumamente inmersivo y si le sumas el hecho de que puedes vincularla directamente a tu pc entonces se vuelve un game changer (si tienes una computadora que pueda correr los juegos). No considero necesario usarlo con un PCVR, pero se agradece demasiado poder hacerlo con un router casero con apenas 3-8 ms de latencia desde una habitación diferente conectado a la red de 2.5ghz. Si quieres desconectarte un par de horas del mundo (porque eso es lo que en promedio dura su batería) y pasar un buen rato, esta es la opción a tomar. Respecto a la batería, aunque pueda parecer algo escasa, es suficiente si tomamos en cuenta la necesidad de descansar los ojos, de todos modos si requieres más tiempo puedes conectarte directamente al pc adquiriendo cualquier cable usb 3.2 a usb c o a un powerbank de diversas capacidades para alargar tus sesiones de VR.Si esperas una calidad visual cercana a la que tenemos en el mundo real, entonces te recomiendo que inviertas en visores del doble o triple de precio, pero por este precio considero competente la percepción de los objetos renderizados por el visor por sí mismo y vía PC es sobresaliente, pero con puntos a destacar como lo son el texto que por lo que entiendo en casi cualquier visor de uso no profesional suelen notarse algo borrososos en algunos ángulos de visión, pero es cuestión de explorar y encontrar los puntos de enfoque de la visión para poder leer sin mayor esfuerzo texto en esta plataforma. Satisfecho 100% con esta compra.Edit: Desafortunadamente a la semana y media de uso murieron un par de pixeles justo en el centro, por lo que opté por devolverlo para posteriormente pedir otro que no tenga este defecto, así que por esto cambio mi calificación de 5 a 4 estrellas.

Primeramente, el visor es de lo mejor qué hay en el mercado CONSIDERANDO el precio; un valve index es MUY caro, pero tiene adiciones qué el Quest 2 no y viceversa; eso es lo que lo hace un gran visor a comparación de los de tope de gama.Si tienes planeado usarlo para jugar en tu computadora:1) Necesitas una GPU y CPU capaces de correr realidad virtual.2) Requieres de un cable adicional cómo el Oculus Link, SIN EMBARGO, existen cables genéricos cómo alternativas, que son mejores, y más largos.2.1) Si vas a comprar un cable genérico, asegurate de qué sea:USB-C 3.1 a USB-C 3.1 ó USB-A 3.1 a USB C; estos cables rondan entre los 490-780 pesos mexicanos por el simple hecho de ser 3.1, ES OBLIGATORIO que sean 3.1 y no 2.0, porque de lo contrario vas a gastar de más al darte cuenta que vas a tener un rendimiento pobre, no gastes 200 o 300 mxn para después gastar otros 500 mxn.3) Una nueva correa o headstrap; sí, las reseñas eran ciertas; el headstrap o correa que viene por defecto es un dolor de cabeza (literalmente) es un mal diseño ya que no distribuye de forma homogénea el peso del viso sobre tu cabeza y por ende se vuelve incómodo a la larga.Yo compre el BOBOVR M2 y es una maravilla, tomando casi el diseño del Rift s, el soporte que te da en el occipital y la facilidad de ajustarlo lo hacen un aditamento indispensable.Y eso es todo lo que yo considero necesario para poder disfrutar el visor al máximo.Edit: RECOMIENDO USAR OCULUS LINK, SI EL CABLE ALTERNATIVO LES LLEGA A FALLAR, YA NO COMPREN DE ESE TIPO, VAYANSE A LA SEGURA Y USEN EL ORIGINAL, AUNQUE SEA MÁS CARO.

My expectations were probably a little too high to be able to just plug the thing into my computer and start playing. It led me through a very linear and invasive data gathering setup with no way to skip or ignore. Why would facebook do this? They're making most of their money on this product collecting your data by linking this product to everything it possibly can. You are paying for a way for facebook to gather your info and make money off of it. You don't like it? Return it like I did. I have a lot of great things to say about the return process. This is the first thing I've ever returned, and I gotta say that it was a great process.Facebook stuff aside, the screen door effect was very noticeable and distracting. I might be a bit spoiled from having a 4k monitor, but it was definitely a large step down from where I would be impressed. The strap it comes with is pretty bad. I couldn't get it on my head right. When I did finally get it in an ok place on my head with the eye spacers just right, there was a GIANT gap where the nose section should meet my face. Everything said and done, I couldn't return the thing fast enough. I owned it maybe 2 hours before I totally lost interest.

Awesome experience with the new updated 128 gb version, i am still trying out new games but until now it has been a very good experience. Both my daughters 6 and 3 year old are enjoying it as well.First things first, you do not need a PC to use this VR headset, however if your an advanced gamer then you probably have a gaming pc that might work with PCVR games, others please check the minimum requirement before you buy a PC for PCVR gaming.Again note with this Quest 2 you do not need a PC it works standalone and you only need a good internet connection, you can buy or get free games from Oculus store or Sidequest, tons of video on youtube on how to use sidequest so check it out. Also you can install youtube and Netflix and use it to watch 360 videos and 3d  movies.Some complain of blurriness, so note you have to adjust the straps so that you are looking straight into it, everything in your periphery will be blur so adjust everytime you wear it, it should be sticking to your face tightly.If you have glasses then they need to be small as my computer glasses did not fit but i think you will have some problems when using it with glasses.Finally it absolutely fun to play with these, if you get it under 40 k for 128 GB then its a good deal in India , i tried shipping it out from US to India but the order was not completed as they do not ship things with battery so anyways buy it from here in India and it will be delivered the next day.

The best value for money standalone VR headset.Dont go for the negative review that it has bad lense or is cheap bla bla bla, cause you cant even find any VR standalone headset at this price.1. Quality is great, even if you drop it it wont break easily and still works, check out ThrillSeeker channel on youtube for more strees test that guy did.2. Lenses are old once, yes they are but in this segment they wont dissapoint you compared to $1000 Valve Index3. Resolution and FOV is good but not great but perfect for movies and watching 3d movies, 360 movies and Oculus games for sure. Casual user wont even find any difference4. Great library of games, litttle expensive but you get sales now and then and you have sidequest if you want more for free and also with some tricks you can install any android apps.5. The glimps and your start to metaverse6. Battery is a concern but get the cable creation cable and you are goog to go. Get the 16ft one7. Install Sidequest. (Mobile and PC) if you want a lot of best and free content and if you are a advanced PC user. Not recommended for users not fimiliar with advance PC use or adb, but you get a tons of tutorial on youtube if you want to try.8. If you have a good PC, VR ready GPU, then this can play Steam VR as well, now it has Airlink wireless as well, but you need Wifi6, 5ghz band and PC connected using ethernet for best quality.9. Amazing hand tracking and controllers at this range10. In any case you end up scratching the lenses, get a polywatch solution and see the magic, it would be as good as new, thank me later for that advice. See youtube for more info11. Great mutiplayer capabilities, mic is great and stock speaker are just awesome, and you can still connect your own headsets as well.12. Get a rechargable battery for your controller, cost around rs400 with batgery and its charger.13. If you still have more money get an Elite strap for best comfort and wobble free experience.14. If you sweat much, mind that you might see fog on lense on prolong use, there are tons of alrernatives to try to avoid that, but the cheapest option is simply put a tissue to your forehead and put on the headset and good to go.15. You are still here that means you are convinced, just go for it and buy it, you will not regret for sure. Search me in case you need more assistance on Oculus,  Ashura- is my Oculus id.

Realizei a compra através da loja DigitalFlash, o produto chegou rápido e é excelente! Vale muito a pena ter um Oculus Quest 2, parece ser resistente, tem ótima resposta dos comandos e fica bem preso na cabeça. Eu já tinha usado um VR do tipo que encaixa o celular como tela, mas não se compara com esse Oculus Quest que realmente foi feito pra isso. Vem com o Oculus e os controles, chegou rápido, a caixa estava lacrada e não estava danificada. Recomendo!

Produto maravilhoso, funciona perfeitamente, é MUITO divertido com toda certeza... O único problema é que tive um problema com o controle esquerdo... Como uso muito em games de tiro, utilizo o analógico do controle esquerdo com frequência, e acho que consequentemente ele começou a dar problema... De vez em quando ele fica mexendo sozinho o analógico pra baixo. Tentei entrar com o suporte da loja para poder trocar o controle, uma vez que faz aprox. 1 mês que estou com o produto, e na ""elegibilidade de devolução/troca"" está dizendo que faz 3 dias que venceu meu prazo para troca do produto e 2 dias para a devolução do mesmo. Mandei mensagem para a loja faz um tempo fazendo tal reclamação, porém não me responderam e agora perdi o prazo de troca/devolução.De qualquer maneira, o produto é maravilhoso, funciona perfeitamente (tirando o problema do controle que acho que foi mais má sorte minha mesmo, já que meus amigos que também tem, nunca tiveram esse problema), e minha reclamação fica apenas com o compromisso da loja com o cliente. Agora não sei como  posso arrumar o controle. E aqui onde moro não possui assistência técnica para isso... PRODUTO: Nota 9,5; Entrega: NOTA 9; VENDEDOR: 5.

 Produto chegou rápido (7 dias) / Caixa muito linda e resistente / o óculos surpreende demais! Nos primeiros minutos da uma sensação estranha, mas depois é só alegria. Produto veio impecável, com todos os lacres intactos. Só não me agradou a bateria, pois dura cerca de 2 horas apenas, mas eu comprei um power bank para poder jogar por mais tempo, recomendo comprarem se não vão se decepcionar pelo tempo de duração. Produto maravilhoso, valeu a pena cada centavo investido / lembrando que os jogos da plataforma são absurdamente caros, mas existe pirataria pra tudo né?

Ghosting effect, image at corner of the lens  blurry, all good games are paid in range of Rs 1500-2500 which are very costly seeing the quality.After spending 35k, you need to spend 4-5k for storage and its scratch protection films which are mot easily available.Build Quality is great but color is white due to which it easily catches dust and scratches. Just good for 1 day experience.Overall, not price worth for given graphics, VR quality and performance.Logical to purchase after 2-3years if any worthy PC games are ported and price of available games are reduced.

La verdad que he probado por primera vez las VR y puedo decir que es bastante asombroso hay mucho que se puede hacer utilizando directamente las quest 2 o conectándolas a las pc, puedo decir que es bastante practica, los controles son muy inmersos y cómodos en su totalidad, por otro lado tienes funciones como usar los dedos de las manos como mando gracias a las cámaras de la parte de abajo para controlar las quest 2, compatible también si lo usas en pc. Puedo decir que tiene bastantes accesorios que hacen que el Quest 2 sea aun mas cómodo.Igualmente vi un par de observaciones y me atrevo a responderlas.Lo de la distancia de los ojos, cuenta solo con tres modos y puedo decir que directamente puede ser conflictivo para persona que se encuentran fuera del rango que tiene, por lo que he visto en otros videos sobre su antecesor este no tenia el problema por que se ajustaba un poco mas libre.Vista ligeramente borrosa esto si lo puedo confirmar pero igual no es algo que sea tan grave ya que al estar jugando no lo notas.La duración de la autonomía.A esto si pude notar que dura solo 2 horas, pero pues tengamos en cuenta el por que teniendo lo del seguimiento de los mandos las 4 cámaras que tiene en funcionamiento en todo momento para la inmersión en vr, una pantalla que casi da 2k a 120hz y una potencia que considero muy buena pues hace que todo esto se gaste rápido.¿Como lo soluciono? Pues solo compra una PowerBank ya sea de 10000 MaH o 20000, con eso te dará suficiente para jugar durante unas 4 o 6 horas, al menos a mi me ha dado ese tiempo.Por otro lado la duración de la batería de los mandos es bastante larga eso si lo puedo asegurar.Temperatura.En lugares donde tengas ventilación y no en temperatura normal podrás notar que no se calienta, pero al andar en lugares donde no tengas ventilación y a temperatura normal vas a ver que si se calienta como cuando juegas con tu teléfono a brillo máximoHe leido algunas observaciones de lo que es el Oculus Quest 2 sobre lo que es que puede ser incomodoCosas que podrían ser desventaja?Pues el hecho de que requiere una cuenta obligatoria de Facebook para poder utilizarlo quizas para la mayoría dirá ""MEH tengo cuenta de Facebook"" pero recordemos que hay gente que no le gusta dicha plataforma y considero que pues no es necesario, igualmente la desventaja esta que las aplicaciones que hayas adquiridos se enlazan con dicha cuenta, si pierdes esa cuenta pierdes las aplicaciones. Y pues igual he leído algunas reseñas que dicen ""Me cree una cuenta de Facebook y a la semana me la bloquearon por que decían que era cuenta falsa y perdí todas las aplicaciones adquiridas"".Por otro lado el sujetador es de un material de plástico y tela que a largo plazo de utilidad es incomodo, por suerte se pueden comprar otros sujetadores mas cómodos.¿Como se conecta a la PC?Existen dos maneras la primera es usando AirLink que considero poco practico y problemático al menos de las veces que intente usar la pc, por otro lado puedes adquirir Virtual Desktop que cuesta 15 Dolares que pues igualmente lo mismo, pero este si es completamente practico. La segunda opción seria utilizando solo  un cable que sea de 3.0 o superior, que por lo menos con uno de un Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 pro me ha servido.Lo vale? Si honestamente lo vale por la cantidad de juegos gratuitos que puedes descargar tanto en la plataforma oculus o de sidequest o también jugando en la PC.OJO: La foto con el sujetador actual se compro por separado no es el original.

 Las primeras veces que lo usas se siente un poco extraño y te puedes tener pequeños mareos, pero después de un rato te acostumbras. Los usé en PCVR con ""Air Link"" (conexión wifi) no tuve ningún retraso o lag en el PC.Por ultimo debo decir que los gráficos de PC y los de Oculus se ven diferentes, el de Oculus se ve de menor calidad pero no es nada del otro mundo, se disfruta bastante (esto lo digo por quienes no tienen PC y no saben si comprarlo)

Got it on 25/01/2022. Writing this on 09/02/2022.TL;DR -Great headset. Absolutely worth the price. Buy paid games if you want to take full advantage of the Quest 2. There are other ways too to play a paid game as this is an android interface. My User ID in Eleven Table Tennsi is ZIGZAG@WII. find me there and we'll have a good match.Now, to those who really want to read this review,Pros.1. The moment you put it on, you'll want to stay in it and touch every part of the environment you're in. In some cases you can, in some you can't.2. Myth that the vision is blurry is true. But you'll find it's more than usable but not quite as sharp as any other more expensive VR headset like the Valve Index or the HP Reverb G2. But at this price point, it's the best you'll ever get!3. YouTube 360° is reaaallly good. Netflix's video quality is more than OK but not as sharp as you'll find on your phone at 1080p. Prime video is surprisingly better quality than that of Netflix.4. You'll find free games those are good for what they offer but paid games will blow your mind. Some of the examples are 1. Eleven Table Tennis (outstanding physics and totally realistic 97% of the times), 2. Beat Saber (it's the poster child of the Quest 2), 3. Pistol Whip ( makes you feel like a cowboy shooting targets in slo-mo and doing that to the beat!), 4. Zenith- The Last city (the closest we've come to a VR MMO like SAO)Cons.1. As I've written above, the blurry quality. Nothing we can do about it. Some YouTubes have found some settings to increase the quality and frame rate in developer mode but it resers everytime you turn off the Quest 2.2. The strap and the padding. There's always better ones out there so find them. In India, it's either pricey or impossible to get.3. You get a US flat pin charger in the box so use it with a 3-pin that supports it.4. I'd suggest you use the charger given in the box as there have been reports of the charging port melting due to excessive charging and what not.I will, if I can, edit this review in the future if I come across anything new. Beware of 5 star reviews as the seller gives Amazon gift cards in the box to give 5 star ratings. Other than that, the package arrived safely and on time so no problem there. Thanks for reading it so far. 🖖🏾

I was skeptical before buying this one as many had reviewed about blurriness and not enough IPD. Here is my experience:Pros.:1) Just amazing clarity in vision  and sound. Really immersive, takes you into a whole new world.2) Wireless. The big advantage of being able to play standalone games and pcvr via wifi.(You will need pcvr ready pc and wifi 6 though if you are thinking about pcvr otherwise there would be lot of lag). I don't play pcvr much and standalone games are great.3)Hand tracking is great feature. It's rather in experimental stage in my opinion as not many games or app use it but it will be popular in near future.4)Cheaper than other VR consoles. Even with great features, the price is reasonable.Cons.:1) the face interface could definitely use better foam and leather or synthetic covering.2) I have 3d printer so I got my self strap support for free which made it really comfortable to use. For those who don't have 3d printer, finding good quality elite strap would be a hassle and extra cost. Company could have provided that.3)Facebook login. You have to use fb account to use all the features of console. I think that could have been avoided, but we are already using Google account for everything in our phones so our privacy is already compromised. Still if you don't want to use your main fb account,  you make a new fb account and sign in via that one.4) The device has lot of potential for great AR use, but due to laws and set limitations there is not much development in AR and VR section.5) Though there are games available on sidequest to play for free, company should have made a few free games of their own rather than limiting to ""first steps"". You also need to take cost of buying games into account. But as I said there is a lot of free stuff on sidequest to keep you engaged.So overall I would recommend this to those who can accept the limitations of the device. And yes before buying, please check your inter pupillary distance (IPD), so that you know if it is OK for you to buy or not.

Very good VR headset in this price point. There are several points that could be improved. First, the screen door effect, it's quite a bit and that limits you immersion. Many reviews say that Quest 2 has almost no screen door effect, but I found it not to be true. It is less, but not completely gone. Field of View could be improved. And few other things. Otherwise it's a killer entry level VR headset.For me the best feature is the ability of play PC VR games wireless. I didn't use Quest 2 as standalone for two reasons. 1. The quality of PC VR is unmatched. 2. the same game which is available in Quest Store is at-least 3 times more expensive than steam counter part. With Oculus AirLink I can play every game nicely. There are few times when frames get dropped and that hinders game play, else mostly it's great. It could be my network gears as well. For Beat Saber it's too much (almost all the songs gets dropped frame resulting missing hits), and for other games it's there but you can live with it.This is a very good VR headset. If you can afford to buy HP reverb G2 as well, buy both, if you can afford to buy any of those, go for G2. Or if you buy Quest 2 only, you will still be having awesome time.

## Pros:- Cheap, Meta is selling at this price probably at a loss to attract more people. 128GB for around 33-35k is a great price.- Relatively higher resolution compared to a non-existent competition in this price range.- The quality of sensors is top notch. The tracking is extremely accurate.- It's relatively lightweight and can run off battery which means no cables. Very convenient and definitely the future direction.## Areas for improvement:- The displays could use OLED for better blacks. Though using OLED will hurt longevity so this one gets a pass. Currently blacks are like gray and that is something you will notice if you look for it.- The resolution could use an improvement. Again, it's an extremely competitive resolution for the price, but since it's so close to your eyes, even this feels pixelated and low res. It's early VR tech so expect that to improve with time.- The battery life is barely 2 hours on a full charge depending on what you're viewing. It's reasonably good, but in the future we could be looking at more efficient devices.- There should be a OS level simulated way to rotate when sitting still. It's tedious to have to get up just to rotate to other side of a 360 degree video. Allow simulating that via controls or something on OS level.- The headset strap is not comfortable for long wearing sessions. I should not have to spend more money to get a better quality strap. Wearing this device is a primary function and you shouldn't have to buy an accessory to make it better, regardless of the price. Only possible con I an think of, but it gets a pass this time.- On a related note, as this tech gets better, I expect components to shrink and this to get lighter and sleeker.- Would be nice to not have to create a Facebook account for this, but let's be honest, that's why they're selling this at a loss. To collect more customers and collect your data to target ads at you. That's how they make money, by selling ads and services.- Remotely installing apps from mobile is a hit or a miss. Most times it doesn't start downloading and I have to manually trigger app downloads. I think it's a temporary bug which they can easily fix.## Other notes:- Use Firefox reality browser. Way better than default and support ad blocking, multiple window and is also far more convenient and reliable with Web XR experiences.- Give Oculus TV a try. It's like YouTube VR but the interface is much nicer and the recommendations are also extremely good.- You can cast your Oculus view to your phone. This is super convenient when showing this to a friend or family member. Just cast to your phone so that you have a sense of what your friend/family member is seeing and guide them accordingly.## Summary:Great stuff honestly. Making VR affordable (regardless of the intentions) also opens it up to more developers across the world and that will only help give us better VR experiences over time. Looking forward to develop some WebXR and native oculus experiences using this.

Mucha gente tiene la duda sobre si comprar o no las Quest 2 para poder jugar a juegos como el Pavlov, el Subnautica, SuperHOT, Half Life Alyx, etc.Si, si se puede, y es muy recomendable, pero antes que nada, estas gafas de VR a diferencia de las primeras que lanzó Oculus, no son solo dos monitores y ya, es una consola.Una de las mayores ventajas que yo le veo a las Quest 2 es su modo inalámbrico, o el modo que viene por defecto. Si bien el consumo de batería en este modo es, pues, importante, los gráficos que podemos apreciar no solo no están mal, son lo suficientemente buenos para mantener un frame-rate adecuado, y una inmersión muy buena, y todo esto sin necesidad de una PC.Los altavoces que vienen incluidos son bastante buenos, están muy bien direccionados y no se ven afectados en gran medida por el ruido ambiente a menos que tengas una cantidad criminal de ruido ambiente cerca de ti, en cuyo caso se pueden usar audífonos cableados por un jack de 3.5mm, y también recomendaría buscar un lugar que no tenga tanto ruido ambiente, así es como te da tinnitus.Yo recomiendo revisar la Store de Oculus desde su página si planteas nunca conectar las gafas a una PC, seleccionar varios juegos que te gusten y considerar si son suficientes para realizar la compra. Spoiler: los juegos de la Oculus Store son todo, menos baratos.De igual forma, Oculus nos ofrece dos formas de conectar nuestras gafas a una PC para poder jugar, ya sea juegos de la tienda de Steam, o juegos de la tienda de Oculus directo al PC (esto para obtener mejores gráficos y mayor framerate): Air Link y Link.El AirLink funciona vía wireless, y es la única que he usado. Si tu internet tiende a presentar intermitencias por más cortas que estas sean, o si tu PC tiene problemas con tener muchas aplicaciones abiertas, quizá el Link sea la mejor opción, en cuyo caso, tienes la opción de conectarlo vía USBC-USBC, o vía USB3.1-USBC, y por las reseñas y opiniones que he podido ver, ambas opciones funcionan casi igual: latencia extremadamente baja, consumo de batería decente en el caso del Air Link, posibilidad de manipular la PC desde las gafas, y gráficos bastante buenos.Si tienes un poco de dinero que te sobre y quieres experimentar cosas nuevas relacionadas al gaming, son la mejor opción, eso si, por su precio regular, ni se les ocurra comprar las versiones de 128GB en 9,000 pesos o más, pueden comprar las Quest 2 en su precio normal, 2 a 3 juegos en la tienda de Oculus o de Steam y el cable Link de 5 o 10 metros por los 9,000 pesos que cuestan las gafas por temporadas, lo mejor siempre es estar revisando los precios.

The order was placed on 21 October 2021, and received on 25 October - 4 days to be shipped from USA to Singapore! Amazon Prime membership has it's perks.The Oculus box was well packed and protected, and in impeccable condition.After setting up the pre-requisite Facebook account, the first images on the headset were astounding. The screen was clear, and sound from the built in speakers better than expected. The demo games I downloaded so far were Saber Beat and Superhot, both were entirely immersive.VR headsets has improved tremendously in the last few years, and for USD299, it's a bargain. I would highly recommend the Quest 2 to anyone.

Felizmente o FACEBOOK resolveu assumir a Oculus e o resultado foi um produto primoroso.

La experiencia del VR es única, no esperen ver gráficos super buenos de forma nativa, a menos que lo conecten a una PC muy potente. Pero de manera independiente el oculus ofrece una experiencia única, jugar sin cables ayuda muchísimo a la inmersión, de plano te desconectas del mundo exterior y vives los videojuegos!. El único detalle es que la batería es insuficiente para sesiones largas de juego, pero aún así estoy muy contento con mi compra, lo recomiendo totalmente, en especial a quienes no han tenido un acercamiento con el VR.

Bem-acabado, desenvolvido, embalagem perfeita, funciona muito bem.Para jogos com mais detalhes gráficos ou mais pesados, recomendo o uso do como de dados. Para algo mais casual, ou mais simples, o Air Link funciona muito bem. Existe todo um conjunto de recomendações para o Air Link, que é usar 100% sem fios, vale ler o material no site do Oculus Quest 2 para se familiarizar com as necessidades básicas. Já adianto: um roteador AC1200 é o mínimo para operar.

I had been using this for almost a month before writing a review. This VR headset is an all in one headset, it can be operate like a smartphone without connecting to a pc.Future owners who confused on the storage capacity selection there are few tips here. 128 GB is already sufficient for me to store around 15 apps with some additional storage left. 256 GB might be a better choice for you if you have tons of files to store in the VR headset without planning to remove it.I have a larger head with spectacles, the original straps will be too tight for me. Even if I am not, I highly recommend the new user to own a straps too, it is way more comfortable when you are wearing it.

Las oculus funcionan de maravilla, la manera en que detecta el entorno es de lo mejor que he visto en lentes de realidad virtual, además de que ya no se necesita una pc super potente para correr los juegos es lo mejor, la batería es corta pero considero que te llega a las dos horas y media y el strap que tanto critican yo no le tengo ningún pero, si pudiera ser mejor pero no es nada del otro mundo. Como son blancas se ensucian un montón, no importa si tienes las manos limpias pasan los días y tanto como los controles y el visor ya van a estar sucio, además de que las straps son dificilísimos de limpiar. Lo realmente malo de este producto es que los juegos son excesivamente caros a comparación de un PC, hablo de que en ocasiones le suben hasta un 40% el costo del juego a comparación de comprarlo en computadora, por lo que si tienes una pc buena lo razonable es comprar el cable de 5 metros y comprar los juegos en la pc pero esa idea de stan alone ya se elimina por completo que era su principal diferenciador. También si existe un cataloga de unos 40 a 50 juegos muy top, pero que son juegos que en 1 día los terminas y por lo que pagas hasta aveces no sientes que valgan la pena, y también existen juegos muy meh que no valen la pena, siento yo que les hace falta un filtro de juegos mas bueno. Para ver videos, netflix y ese tipo de apps realmente si tienes una inmersión mejor que solamente verlo en pantalla.

O Produto é ótimo, cumpre mais do que promete, pois te dá uma imersão na VR fora do real. Para quem já utilizou outros VR's, vai se surpreender com esse. Recomendo pesquisarem bem no YouTube, assistir vídeos pois é um investimento alto, mas que para quem gosta, vale cada centavo. Não dei 5 estrelas, apesar de merecer, mais por uma questão de ser verdadeiro sobre a qualidade geral do produto. A durabilidade dele vai depender do quanto de cuidado você terá, pois ele se apresenta frágil, ou seja, uma queda pode danificar, mas tomando cuidados, é uma ótima diversão. Sua bateria dura cerca de 2 hrs, o bastante para cansar uma pessoa, mas se você estiver em Grupo de Amigos, a bateria vai fazer falta, recomendo um upgrade de bateria externa ou powerbank com um cabo. Custo benefício é outro ponto complicado, além do preço do produto ser alto, se prepare para comprar jogos em Dólares, jogos bons por volta de 19 dólares e jogos mais requintados entre 24 e 30 dólares, então é um investimento que tem que se levar em consideração. Se os preços não te assustam, compre e seja feliz, porque vale a pena, principalmente para roda de família e amigos. E ultima recomendação, recomendo ter um ChromeCast ou similar para transmitir na TV, pois daí todos assistem o que vc está assistindo, risadas garantidas.

Received the latest manufactured device dated March 22. Really happy with the seller sending me the latest model which has no defects.Initially I had some doubts about the lens being defected due to the corners, edges having some dots. I dont know what they are could be to stick the lens to the frame.Might take some time to know the best IPD setting, first I had it set on 2 but wasn't happy with the blurry vision then changed to 3 and now it's all clear.Seller is genuine and if you are planning to purchase, purchase it.It might take a little while to set yourself from the vection, as you feel the motion sickness in games which has continuous movement. But you can get used to it slowly.Overall I am really enjoying Oculus Quest 2.Must try Apps:Horizon Venues,Multiverse.

Es un gran preducto.. bastante imersivo.. si ya has usado unos VR antes entonces te gustaran bastante por lo facil de usar, pero si es la primera vez y esperas ver el mayor avance tecnológico en entretenimiento... bueno en algunos aspectos podria ser. Visualmente se ve bastante bien.. pero no se ve comoletamente nitido, no es por que este dañado sino es la tecnologia que se tiene.. el sonido es bastante bueno!.. para rl tamaño de bocinas, es bastante nitido el sonido y los bajos son buenos... Es mejor usar unos audifonos claroo.. pero para la comidad de no traer audifonos es bastante bueno.Recomendacion... Si lo vas a usar en seciones largas te recomiendo completamente pensar en invertir en un strap elite mejor que el que  lleva por defecto, no es incomoda la que tiene pero en seciones largas si es un poco molesto afemas que es dificil ajustarla exactamente para que no tengas defectos visuales al usarlo.

Pros first.Videos and games look very real.There are some animations that are awesome.Guardian boundry is a good concept. Keeps you inside a safe boundry in VR.You can enable option to see an outline of someone enters your guardian boundry... Helps.The device looks durable. I one smashed the controller in the wall. It saved my hand, also nothing happened to it.Works standalone. You can take it to your friends and family and let them experience it also.Cons.Resolution could be better.Content is there... But still not much or enough as of now.The straps have to be adjusted each time you wear it.Gets very hot inside the device. I sweat like crazy and it gets blurry after some time may be because of water vapour condensing on the lens.OverallI'm playing Resident evil 4, experience is very good overall. Also installed blade and sorcery, it's good experience, but the game does not have story mode yet, just some arenas to fight with some enemies. Overall a very good experience till now. I will try to get the cable and connect to pc and try the pc VR games next, PC needs to be upgraded though. Five stars to the product.

A experiência de poder jogar na realidade virtual com o seus amigos, ou ver videos, filmes e séries, é surpreendentemente incrivel! estou completamente apaixonada pelo Oculus quest 2, mas infelizmente nem tudo é perfeito. A bateria do oculus dura em torno de 2 a 3 horas, (depende do que você pretende fazer, e suas configurações), infelizmente é bem pouco tempo para os viciados nessa experiência, mas eu já tinha ciência dessa parte antes de comprar. Mas o problema que realmente está me incomodando é o fato do analogico do controle esquerdo começou a se mover sozinho e bugar em alguns jogos, isso estraga bastante a experiência.

Debo comenzar por decir que sí son sorprendentes. Te imaginas cómo serán, pero al probarlos realmente supera tus expectativas. Al paso de los días ya comienzas a normalizar esa tecnología e incluso puedes llegar a pensar en aspectos a mejorar (como los gráficos, los cuales, por cierto, son los que deben ser para el precio en el que están las gafas).Compré las gafas porque quería hacer un escritorio virtual con muchos monitores. Aunque se supone que ya hay como 3 apps que lo hacen, en realidad no se logra eso tan sencillamente y lamentablemente los desarrolladores no te dicen la causa precisa, sino que te tienes que ir dando cuenta por qué no se puede tan fácilmente (llevo alrededor de 20 horas netas investigando y, aunque aún no lo descubro con certeza, creo que ha sido porque la tarjeta gráfica de mi computadora no es apta para sus gafas y otra razón es el internet que no sé por qué pero en las gafas falla más que en una computadora, me falta también probar apps de paga, pero me preocupa pagar por ellas y que tampoco funcionen)

Most affordable headset to play Half-life: Alyx! So far my experience has been great. There is a minor issue that plugging it into a desktop PC you cannot use the link cable to play while charging the headset. This is a limitation of the desktop motherboards rather than the device. Get a powered usb hub to charge your oculus quest 2 while playing!

Packing was good, came two days ahead of scheduled delivery giving me a long weekend to explore.Setting up was straight forward. Me and my daughter use spectacles so took some time adjust but now very comfortable.Most VR apps on App Store is priced high.Probably each person in family who uses it heavily needs his/her own device. Hope family app sharing is offered by meta.usb c cable include is short so you can’t play games while it is charging , longer cable 2-3 meter might be necessary.Hope in coming years the weight is reduced, screen resolution gets improved all metaverse projects like decentraland all are available as apps

Aunque hay muchos factores a tomar en cuenta para comprarlos.

This is my first ever VR experience, I gave it to my mum to try it, she loved it. She was saying ""Kids I am living here forever, make your own food and live"" hahaha. I played the Jurassic park immersive video, she loved it, she was ""Kids save me, this dino is probably going to eat me"" hahahaFew things to note:The default band is not stable enough to keep the vr lens in correct position for even a short period of moment.

I received my oculus quest 2 few days and it is amazing. I was hesitant to buy it first because I never owned a VR headset but once I tried it on, those feelings went away. The amount of technology facebook managed to build into this is amazing. It has a flagship processor, 4 cameras with tracking tech, 2 1080p screen and 2 tracking hand controllers. As someone who loves technology, this is unheard of in this price range. The closest thing is the HTC VIVE VR headset and it close 3 times as much with more complicated set up. I would suggest anyone who loves tech to buy this thing. Just make sure your IPD is in the range of this headset or else the vision will be blurry.P.S. If you do not like facebook or their practices, stay away from this headset because everything you do will be through your facebook account.

Chegou mal embalado e com a caixa amassada, fiquei com medo de não funcionar. O produto em si chegou intacto e até agora funciona bem. Possui um sistema operacional próprio com jogos e aplicativos em realidade virtual e também possui a opção de conectar a um computador, porém o computador precisa ter uma capacidade gráfica boa para proporcionar uma experiência satisfatória. É muito divertido de usar e muito bom para se divertir com outras pessoas, pois possui capacidade de espelhar o que é visto pelo usuário em um navegador web. O único óculos de RV viável no Brasil.

While the device is easy to setup. There is alot of improvements needed. First the device can't fit with my glasses. Wearing it is pretty heavy , after 20mins it's really tiring to wear longer. Only the centre of your view point is sharp, if u move your eyesight without moving yout head u will notice the images are blurred. Not good for eyes if u wear longer. I am very disappointed that there is no std cable to the pc. An additional link cable cost a whopping 99dollar. And the game store has very little games, the better games are on steam. For a $500 purchase, I rather buy a ps5 or a Nintendo switch.....

Después de eliminar unos zombies, corté cajas con mis katanas y regresé a mi casa a jugar con mi Oculus Quest 2. Ya en serio. Si tienes Pc esta versión te conviene, ya que al reproducir los juegos en la computadora no necesitas el espacio del visor y te ahorras unos dineros. La inmersión es buena y el audio sorprende. Al ser blanco se ensucia con facilidad, tanto el plástico como las tiras de tela. El AirLink (Conexión remota) es decente y se está mejorando. Se recomienda el cable link y/o un buen modem exclusivo para el Oculus, pero eso ya es inversión para mejorar la experiencia.

Por su precio es una excelente inversión si quieres empezar en VR, tiene buen espacio, es barato, no necesitas equipamiento extra, buen catalogo de juegos y en general muy bueno.Algunos problemas que me he encontrado sin embargo es que para el juego VRchat este visor no es el mejor (Es un juego social, en este juego es posible mover el cuerpo entero con otros visores, con el Quest 2 solo la cabeza y manos). No se pueden ver peliculas acostado, cosa que hubiera estado genial. A veces el seguimiento falla en algunos juegos. Es un poco entretenido ver que opción de IPD es la que mejor se te acomoda, y tienes que tener el visor quieto para poder ver bien en vez de ligeramente borroso.En conclusión, un visor genial, solo necesitas invertir un poco en una correa nueva para la cabeza.

PRÓS: Imersão maravilhosa, diversão garantida. Os vídeos no YouTube não é igual pegar o console e jogar. Você entra no jogo, cada passo dado é pensado.CONTRA: Bateria dura em média 2 horas (alguns jogos você se cansa antes de acabar a bateria, mas outros você precisa deixar carregando para continuar). O valor de mercado aqui no Brasil ainda é caro, mas pela experiência ainda vale a pena. A loja de jogos oficial é em Dolar, isso é uma pena.

This 128GB storage capacity is supposed to replace in full the previous 64GB version while keeping the same amazing price!I must admit this 128GB now suits most newer games which are usually massive in size. This is really an excellent space to store good/new/high quality games. Even giving the option to store/watch more 2D and 3D movies.I myself liked the head strap that comes with it, although I never tried the Elite Strap.I would also recommend getting an anti-scratch silicone ring protector if you wear a glass like me as this should help both: your glasses and the VR lenses from getting scratched. It will let you keep your glasses on while playing games or watching movies.Before you use the headset straight away, it needs a few tweaks here and there to ensure comfortable wear specifically for your head size and comfortable view for your eyes by adjusting both the strap sizing and placement as well as the IPD settings.A VR silicon cover is now included in the box which is a great addition for people with sensitive skin. This also resolves many of the complaints about skin irritation in the previous version.Being a classic PC gamer for many years, I would say VR technology is really something that every gamer should try. Just make sure that you are playing in a safe space and a specialized playing area!The Oculus Quest 2 is a fully standalone VR headset and I may also call it a “gaming monster”, with native built-in games if you don’t have a powerful gaming PC. It also works with steam VR games with no problem if you do have a gaming PC and you can connect them both using Steam link and the Oculus Link desktop app.The headset can have a refresh rate of up to 90Hz for some games, compared to only 72Hz on the previous model which also has a lower resolution. This is a big plus of course.Overall, in my opinion, this is the best VR headset around at this moment which can render up to near 4K resolution at 90hz.

OK So I gave it one star for the fact that VR is cool.It won't get 5 stars nor will I buy another headset from facebook's oculus for the following:-applications are SLOW and freeze all the time no matter how few apps you have open.-Multitasking is limited. Most apps put you all in on their app. There is no desktop and no windows.-Remote desktop is virtual and very slow.-Graphics are not that great. Things close up are fuzzy and pixilated at 1080. VR  is not ready yet.-The keyboards in VR are interrupted by your pointer finger acting like a mouse randomly clicking things when you type.-The headset sucks at mapping my environment. Change one thing and suddenly I have to remap my environment instead of gaming. When you try to remap it... it remembers you placed a guardian or barrier then stops the setup. Then it forgets and makes you do setup. This keeps looping until you are pissed and restart the system.-There is no place to plug in headphones. Everyone has to listen to your music.-I constantly have to go to windows settings because the apps take over my computer speaker... oddly enough the device cannot usb-c connect or air connect but it can VR desktop and turn off my sound even when I turn off the headset.-The headset randomly glitches the environment making you seasick outside of apps-They are like apple trying to restrict all apps or on the Facebook system only. However, then all your friends with other devices are playing games outside of oculus closed system. They need to have a desktop home screen with windows not this browser internet only nonsense. I will not buy another one of these. There is too much to fix! They ruined VR for me. Especially as someone who develops games in UE4

This is my first and only VR experience.  With that said, in just the first few minutes, during the setup and updating process, my mouth was agape.  The tutorial had me smiling in wonder at the feeling of immersion.  The apps available natively to the Quest 2 are varied and fun, if not cheap, but there are demos and free games out there.  We like is so much, we are probably buying a second in the near future.However, my favorite piece of this requires use of a decent PC and fast Wi-Fi: Oculus AirLink, currently in Beta, is a cable free connection to the Oculus program on your computer that allows use of Oculus Rift and Steam VR games.  These are generally games that need the extra processing power of a real GPU, and offer better graphics and more complex environments than the Quest alone can provide.  Google Earth VR, a free app that isn't on the Quest natively is, for me, worth the price of admission on its own.  Being able to walk among the skyscrapers of NYC, or play Gojira in Tokyo is awe inspiring.A couple of minor cons:  Battery life is poor.  During our first days, when we were using it especially heavily, I had a battery pack and USB-C cable connected to the Quest that we'd swap into pockets to add play time.  They make improved head-strap setups that include provisions for holding a battery.About that strap, some in my family complained about it, so we may be shopping for an upgrade.  I can live with it, however.In low light, the guardian, the virtual barrier that is set to keep you from running into walls, can flake out, dropping you out of the game.And lastly, a big con for some folks: This requires an active, real, Facebook account.  Deactivating your account deactivates your Quest.  Deleting you account deletes, permanently, all of your purchased apps, with no refund.  There are lots of reports regarding problems with folks using fake names, secondary accounts, other folk's accounts, etc.  When there are problems, Facebook will delete or lock accounts, and render your Quest a brick.  Customer service is reportedly horrendous when trying to fix these problems.  My advice would be to use your real account, don't fudge around, and you should be fine.  Yes, they are tracking you, Yes they are subsidizing the prices of these thing by commodifying your data.  However, unless you are already complete social media hermit, getting in bed a little deeper isn't going to alter your data footprint in any significant way.  If you are here shopping on Amazon with a cellphone in your hand or pocket, worrying about Facebook is sort of pointless.TL;DR - GET ONE.  It's a great value within the reach of many people.  You can have a ton of fun without a PC, and even more with one.

Got mine delivered really fast. I was able to set up everything with no problem and with ease. Truly a crazy experience to be in a virtual world--you actually forget that what you see isn't actually real. I found myself oftentimes carefully not bumping into the i.e. furniture in the virtual world when it was just space and nothingness outside of it. One of the coolest features I am stumped about is that if you leave a certain area that you have previously marked, the headset has a grayscale camera that reveals what's in front of you. This is extremely useful for safety measures as it alerts you if you stray too far from your marked territory. Absolutely love it! Also, the headset lasts for about ~2 hours before you need to recharge if you're playing games nonstop.Edit: For those who wear glasses, I highly recommend to buy VR Wave prescription lenses with the headset. For me personally, it's been huge inconvenience trying to remove the headset and putting it back on until I made the investment and bought the lenses. It'll definitely help with having fun in VR without having to adjust your headset frequently.

Having owned an HTC Vive for several years, I was interested in trying out what is supposedly the ""next generation"" of VR headsets.  I especially liked the idea that it was smaller and more portable and did not need extra boundary sensors and things.  But right off the bat, the system was annoying and user un-friendly.  For starters, you can't fully-install or run the software  unless you give GPS location information to Facebook.  This is completely unnecessary.  Facebook does not need to know my GPS location in order to enable me to pair the device with my mobile phone (that was another unknown requirement: you have to install a special app on your phone to continue configuration of the device. Hardly plug-and-play, and if you don't give Occulus permission to know your location, it will give you ambiguous messages indicating something is wrong when they know exactly what's wrong: they won't allow you to complete the installation unless you give them unnecessary personal information.  That's inappropriate.)  The Rift has some neat features like a convenient boundary and object detection system, but its processing is just too slow to make VR enjoyable.  Even rudimentary games just do not play well.Ok, fine, after all that mess I fire the system up and it immediately wants to up-sell me on a bunch of extra software that I already have purchased on Steam.  The system is SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWER than other VR headsets years older.  Playing common games like Rec Room or Pokerstars VR result in laggy, unplayable gameplay.  It's really horrible.  I'm very disappointed in this product.  Will not be purchasing any more Occulus products.

I was more than excited to get the new Oculus Quest 2 based on all of the stellar reviews. But I was extremely disappointed with the low quality of the display for a product that's priced this high.It's extremely blurry and not even remotely clear unless you're staring directly at a single spot on the screen. If you even look a little bit left or right then it becomes even more distorted. You're watching videos recorded in 8K that have the look of a 360p equivalent based on what you're actually seeing in front of your eyes.It's clear that the technology has not caught up yet in order to provide a decent VR experience. I feel that they're rushing to sell these standalone units that aren't tethered to PCs, because most people don't have higher end PCs anymore. At least not anywhere close to what you'd need to run it at a decent enough refresh rate or resolution. It's just not powerful enough to run without some decent hardware, which probably run several grand. I feel it's basically like having a smartphone with goggles attached to it.The advances in the actual interaction in the VR world are quite incredible. The controllers and interface are very impressive, which allow you to interact with objects even with your bare hands. However, it's all a moot point if the display quality makes the experience unusable in the first place.I had high hopes of having a better experience based on the reviews that you see everywhere online and on YouTube. It fell far short of my expectations, yet everywhere you look reviewers and companies are raving about it. But I guess if you have a multi-billion dollar company that controls social media, then you're bound to have biased ""opinions"" work out in your favor.Do yourself a major favor and try out someone else's before making the purchase. If you're anything like me, then you just might be completely underwhelmed with this newest VR experience by Oculus.

very good quality headset.  Feels very comfortable to wear if you put back strap near your ocipital bone but sadly lot of people don't know how to wear properly i mentioned.  Great for watch netflix  movie in monster IMAX theater screen and also tons of 3D VR 180 videos on Youtube.  Games are so many to choose and more new game  to come every week.

The unboxing was a nightmare. Couldn't find the usb port. It was covered by protective paper. I thought the power button was a covered usb port and tried to remove it. I tried to piNiall fx starwars game  and ended up standing in the table. I'm not going to waste 2 days to figure it out. I even tried to watch a movie, it was at 720p. And I had motion sickness. If I could afford another headset it would be a Vive that uses Displayport.

The kiddo saved up FOREVER to buy these VR goggles. It was all he could talk about and drove us crazy. He finally had enough, ordered them with expedited shipping, and planted by the door the day they were scheduled to arrive. Exactly 2 days after he got them, he said they kept going to a gray screen, showing some dots, then wouldn't power on until he did a hard restart. We Googled the headset to see if we could resolve the issue. This is a KNOWN problem dating back to their original release and no corrections have been made. Literally thousands of blogs, reviews, and forums address this. I don't blame the seller because they were awesome and very responsive to our refund request after two weeks of trying to figure out a solution. Do your research. Some are just fine with no problems, and then there are those that make a 12 year old question how a manufacturer can continue to sell an item with known issues. The whole ordeal really sucked the wind out of his sails.

Can't say if the product was any good, as once I got it, I discovered (as part of the install process) that you absolutely HAD to have a Facebook account to even install the headset, and, link it to your Facebook account!  Spent some time chatting with their helpdesk who said there was NO way around that...so returned the item.  I refuse to make a FB  account just to use a headset, and certainly don't need Facebook targeting me with ads based on what I play on it.

I really wanted to use this.  I had a Facebook account years ago and didn't like it, so I deactivated it.  My choice.  Now, I could only go under that account, which it said was now disabled.  I can't create a new one.  Every avenue they gave to try to fix it did not work.  It's impossible to actually talk to someone there.  So I can't use this and have to return it.  Why in the world you need to link it to a social platform, I have no idea.  Especially when that platform has such poor customer support.  Guess I'll just have to wait to see what the next Sony VR upgrade will be.

When I try to create an oculus account it requires you to log into Facebook or create a Facebook account.  When I log into my Facebook login through the oculus quest app it just spin and spins and never loads to lets you pair. So we tried my Wife's Facebook account on her iPhone since it didn't work on my Samsung.  Same thing its just stuck on loading.  Then I go to the oculus website and try to create an account with a new Facebook account that I just created.  Same thing just loads loads loads.  2 different phones 2 different browsers on my pc.  clear history per support still no go.I would advise staying away from this VR that requires you to sign into or create a Facebook account just to use it when you can't even set it up.  Horrible experience having to jump through Facebook hoops just to get the VR experience.  Just wait for more reliable VR from Play station, Xbox, Gaming on PC's.  Facebook is the worst.

I took this helmet as my first. I really liked himOf the merits, very good picture quality (no pixels visible)Games can be run directly on the helmet itself, it's just like a console on your head! Moreover, the games look pretty nice, although some games look better on pcExcellent tracking of controllers I have never had such a thing that he lost controllersHand tracking is also present, but it works mediocre enough. It needs excellent lighting and does not cover each other's hands. In general, a cool feature, but for now it needs some work.Well, it's also worth noting that the headset itself has an excellent sound! I thought that he would be pretty mediocre on it, and therefore decided to take headphones as well. Headphones are certainly not bad, but I still prefer the sound from the helmet itself so as not to wear anything extraI also want to note the controllers themselves, the batteries that are preinstalled at the bottom can last a charge for about a month, and also from time to time I can hit the wall and the controllers are quite strong (unlike my fingers)Well, the price is $ 300Of the minuses Once, I accidentally hit the helmet with the controller and the sound in one of the headphones on the helmet disappeared, but then I accidentally hit it again and it came back ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯

I'm very impressed with this headset! I wrestled with whether to pay $100 more for double the storage capacity, but after perusing apps in the Oculus store and averaging app sizes, I determined there was too little value in that. Down the road, if I get REALLY into VR in general, I might wind up regretting that decision, but I honestly think that would be the only thing I'd regret about this device.Oculus was experiencing some kind of server issue that prevented me from completing registration and setup right away, so it was about 4 hours after I unboxed it that I was able to use it. And boy, was I blown away! I still have a VR headset that requires a phone be stuck in it, but I haven't used it in a while for just that reason. This one, of course, doesn't need that, and the resolution is really, really good. Your IPD (Inter-pupillary distance), or the distance between your eyes, can be accommodated by selecting from 3 different widths. I read one review that said the maximum is 68mm, but their IPD was 72. In that case, the image will appear blurry. For that reason, I suggest checking your IPD before you purchase.What's in the box is simple, the headset, two controllers (with batteries), a spacer for those who wear glasses and a silicone piece that makes it comfortable to wear against your face. It's very well balanced and doesn't feel heavy to me, but there are optional head straps you can get if you find it too front-heavy. I also like the passthrough feature that lets you see your real-world environment if/when you need to.I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and immersiveness of the sound, but I will probably get some ear buds soon so I can get a fuller volume level (I usually have the volume on about 6-7). But it sounds great. The 'Home' environment, which is set up like a house or apartment, is really cool, and there are several different designs available.I found the battery life, stated as about two hours, to be pretty accurate, but I bought a 10-foot USB cable so that I could have it plugged in and playing while it's charging (yes, you can use it fully while it's charging). There is a head strap available with a place for an optional battery to extend use time without worrying about a cable, but that doesn't seem necessary to me, at least not at this point. I just got done using it, and I was in VR for about 3 1/2 hours, and battery life was still 82%. So far, I have used it for probably 20 hours total since I've had it, and the controller batteries are still at 100%. I'm sure that depends on what you're doing, though.I have watched a couple of movies, and with the ability to have a curved screen (or flat if you prefer) that views even larger than my 60"" TV, it's just amazing. I've also played a few games, watched some videos of dancers, concerts, and awesome, immersive tours of places like Switzerland, Italy, the Matterhorn, Great Lakes, under-sea stuff and so many more. All of it has been awesome. And so far, I have found enough good, free content that I haven't gotten around to purchasing anything yet!Another effective feature is the voice control. You can do almost anything using voice commands, including powering the device off. I haven't explored that feature too deeply yet, but I have started and stopped apps and games, checked local time and weather and performed several other functions just by telling it what I want. You just double-press the 'Oculus' button to get it to listen for voice commandsOne complaint I know many will have, is that setting up the device REQUIRES a Facebook account. BUT, you can set it so that your FB profile info, including your profile name, will not be revealed in VR if you happen to do some multi-person thing, and neither is your Oculus username revealed to your FB contacts, so that doesn't bother me at all. The only thing I wish, and this is so minor it's really almost petty, but I do wish it came in black. That isn't even worth deducting stars over. Overall, I just love it, and I highly recommend it!

I originally ordered the 64gb but was cancelled due to the transition to 128gb. The storage obviously wasn’t the reason that I wanted to “upgrade” to the Quest 2, it was really for the supposedly lighter weight.  I was disappointed to find out that the weight for both Quest and Quest 2 units are the same. The published weights for both headsets are with their respective straps attached. Of course, the unit with the cloth strap would come out lighter. I discovered this by having both attached to a Beswin Halo strap and both units came in at 731 grams to my surprise. All the YT reviews didn’t bother to check I guess.If it wasn’t for the higher storage, I would have returned this. The higher resolution, and better processor eases the disappointment as well. I would have been ok using the original for a bit longer but might as well enjoy the newest version, even if it is the same weight. The halo strap helps with that a bunch.

I bought this for video games, I have since been blown away by what I have found to be freely available.I have tried around 150 apps/games/experiences. I have only paid for about 8 of them. I learned how to make music tracks in Virtuoso, I took a tour of Ann Frank's house, I learned how it felt to lose your eye sight and experience your surroundings through sound, I have seen countless documentaries (which is a whole new experience since you are there in the world), I got to fly through the International Space Station, I have fought as a gladiator against man and beast, I have fired up my last shot against hordes of zombies before resorting to baseball bats as the adrenaline sores, I have spent many hours exercising in a variety of games, but one of my favorite is Moon Rider (a free VR web browser title)(it's a rhythm game that can be played with light sabers or by punching the beats), and I have also attended concerts and enjoyed events while still being able to be my normal introverted self.My computer is not at all capable of working with VR, so that sucks, but the amount of stuff the Quest 2 can do stand alone is insanely impressive!There is so much here, it is like buying yourself a second life. I highly recommend reading up ahead of time on a site such as UploadVr. They have great introductory stories hidden away on that site specifically to prepare you and educate you on the Quest 2.My 65 year old mother even bought one, primarily for indoor exercise, but she also enjoys the travel apps which is as close to going somewhere as you can get without going there. Personally I enjoy the free Virtual Traveller, but I think my mother uses a pay app.If you are on the fence about this, stop right now and just buy it.The only caveat to this is that you do need enough well lit space that you can swing your arms about in a circle.I very quickly made more and more and more room in my living room. Now with the holidays I new there would be trouble. I punched a Christmas ball off the tree yesterday whole in a demo fight in an amazing boxing game called The Fight. I still haven't found that ball. It was a good solid left hook! I've also punched the ceiling while jumping and grabbing for a frisbee in the free zero g space sports game that plays like a cross between Ender's Game and Tron. In the gladiator game Gladius I ended up punching the handle off my decorative display cabinet. I cut my hand up on that one. The point here is you need space. Even when you try not to move, you move! There is a digital barrier that you start to see if you get too close to the edge, but in the heat of the moment it's not always enough.

Pros:- Fairly Immersive.- Amazing experiences.- Personal home theater, huge movie screen, made even better with paid Virtual Desktop ($20usd) that gives you actual movie theater vibes and tons of other scenes. Oculus link (Free) does a pretty good job with big screen too.- Nice desktop experience in VR through Oculus Link (free)- High refresh rates up to 120hz (if you're wired and can find a game that supports it)- Haven't seen other views to compare, but I'm very satisfied with the resolution. And hear its better than most if not all other VR headsets right now while also keeping in mind its the most compatible with VR games. Im guessing this is the Playstation or XBOX of Virtual Reality. Or they are lining up to be. Either way, its the right choice for gaming and other.- Truly the next level in gaming and virtual spaces like home theater.- Gonna list Half Life: Alyx as a pro. Was my first VR experience, and although god-tier amazing, I would suggest working up to it as not much has compared since :P But I am having fun in other games like Boneworks and TWD Saints and Sinners. I like TWD more so far but I have a few gripes with that game. (Not a reflection of this product)- As anyone would tell you, works well with streaming services. You got your Netflix Hulu and Disney plus.- You can load movies and videos from your pc stored into Oculus directly for trips without wifi.Cons:- Good thing I already owned a beasty gaming pc. You're gonna need one for titles like Half Life: Alyx.- Battery life. Could not watch a 2hr30min movie without plugging in. Con still offset by the amazing movie theater-like experience. Was using Virtual Desktop so maybe the wifi usage played a part.- Real Con, the strap it comes with is uncomfortable and will give you a headache the first week or so.- It is heavy on the front and my forehead and cheeks hurt, requiring me to take a break, wash and massage my face every couple of hours, every day. (I've watched videos on how to adjust and not over-tighten but not much can be done about the reality of the situation. It is far from weightless and fairly noticeable.-If you need glasses to see things far away, you will need glasses for the VR headset too. Special lens caps cost roughly between $60 and $100USD. But it comes with a spacer. You can likely get away with those retro non-spacer glasses.If they have those little feet that push off the nose you might be in trouble and if they are really big, you might be in trouble so look into the dimensions of the quest 2 view port and your glasses. An annoying extra step but probably worth it.-Scuba Diver effect. The view cant be in the pro section. As I said, you'll feel like a scuba diver. Only during the most immersive of times will you not notice too much. To be fair this is.. most of the time.- blurring and lens-rings. If not absolutely perfectly centered, you'll get some blurring in various parts of your view. At first and for a few days the little magnification rings of the actual glass piece of the lenses will be very noticeable in your peripheral. Again to be fair.. again, while having an amazing time, you will not notice.- Also there's this thing about the lens spacing I hear a lot of people complaining about. I think I'm just at the edge of the farthest setting but could probably do with a tiny bit more. Read other reviews and look into it about I forget what its called, the space between both your pupils.- It'll take a few days or more than a week for your mind to ignore some of these, like the rings, occasional blur, and scuba effect.-Serious con, be ready to shell out at least another $100usd or so on extras. $19 link cable $16 extension cable plus breakaway protection, Silicone Grips and hand strap (worth it and kind of necessary for throwing objects in comfort,) $30 Rechargeable batteries or a large supply of AA’s. Be sure either are 1.5v. $10-30. Head Strap pad I bought $15 (not compared to $30-50+ or so elite straps. And if you need the prescription lens caps another $60-100. And your first game ranges from $10-40usd or so, for the good stuff.- Very few free games/stuff. And not that many AAA amazing titles. (Not exactly a reflection of this particular product)-This thing gets sweaty after a few dozen minutes of intense gameplay so have a dry cloth handy and don't get pulled into the ‘pass it on or around after playing beat saber to your friends’ fantasy.IMO/SideNotes Related to this product directly and VR as a whole:- The device should have been a more evenly weight-distributed helmet.- I wouldn't expect to game any more than an hour or two without being plugged in either to a power outlet or pc. Mileage may vary.- Buy a 10 - 20 ft data cable with your purchase. The provided cable is like 3ft or something. You're gonna need it regardless of pc ownership. Search youtube for good 3rd party brands it should cost around $18-28usd or so for a good cable with decent length.- Find your play area and hold your arms out, now plan for an additional one or two feet, mainly North, West and East of you. The Quest 2 comes with a 'Guardian' thats really good at letting you know when you're 'out of bounds' but you will be bending to search or grab stuff reaching and leaning over, tossing things aside (In VR, While stationary, with one or two steps of leeway) make sure you have the space to be swinging your arms around like that. be honest with yourself about this space. If you don't have it, you don't have it. Sorry. I had to rearrange my room a little but luckily I had the space and it was absolutely worth it.-VR is very physical. Some games have seated options but require too much leaning and grabbing and searching to do it sitting down. So be ready to stand and crouch and lean. I kept that from both pro’s and cons. IMO, awesome, but be ready for it. Make yourself take breaks every half to sit and stretch if you're not used to standing all day, but not even taking into account the workout apps, this has gotten me burning more calories and keeping my redstuff circulating more and my metabolism on its toes. Actually crouching behind cover is pretty cool but also tiring lol.- IMO, Probably not a con, too many older games being remade or re-released in VR. Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 with Whispering Hills mod was and is mindblowing but after putting in so many hours on the pc version and playing it for years, its kinda hard to get all the way into again. But I guess for kids who never ever played Fallout 4 and they get it for VR, then it’ll be pretty awesome for them. Same for Resident Evil 4 Which I played on the Gamecube, not in VR yet but I fear the novelty will wear off as I played that game like crazy already and it would be a massive retread - even if VR itself is still amazing, I’ll stand by that. (So not a direct reflection of this product)-I want to see more completely brand new AAA single player games.-I hear GTA San Andreas is coming to VR.. Again, great for kids, but how about a brand new GTA VR?.- Only been in the scene a few weeks but, looking back and ahead, it looks like a really lazy and slow march into making VR a thing for everyone. IMO right now it's still more of a niche enthusiast thing. I only say that because I’ve been hearing about VR for years. What did people play on the Quest 1?- Get a small rug or mat to stand on, maybe even a towel will do so you know when you're stepping off too far out of bounds. I have a small rug I folded up just enough to fit my feet with a little bit of slack on all sides. This’ll make you more comfortable but will also help keep you stationary and orient you. They sell $100 tough gamer standing pads about the size of the guardian, if you have the dedicated space and money for it, I can't stop you I guess, but a simple, thick rug or small yoga mat will do.-Like a baseball plate, add a little point when you draw your guardian space to let you know which way you should be facing at all times, you want that wire mostly behind you at all times.I have more to say but admittedly this is getting long. I would wait a couple of years until a much lighter and more comfortable VR device comes out. But, if you cannot wait any longer and love gaming or just want what VR has to offer. I can tell you that, it is here, and it is amazing.Seeing previews of anything VR on a 2D screen cannot do it justice and neither can words, of this you must trust me, you would have to experience it yourself to truly understand. Ask a friend or coworker if they have one and if you can try it. You wont believe it until you do. Or take the plunge like I did. I have my gripes with this thing, and it's not all fairy tales, but I do not regret purchasing it. Like I said before, it really is the next level in gaming, and it really is here.Be considerate, please. This took a while to write to help you.

I was not impressed with the quality of VR apps and games available right now.  Perhaps in the future VR will be improved to the point where it lives up to the hype.  The roller coaster and spacewalk apps were really good, but after that, I couldn't find any other apps or games that were impressive enough to justify the cost of the headset and accessories.  The accessories are another thing.  In order to use it, I needed to buy special headphones made especially for Oculus, a head strap that actually worked, an aftermarket face mask to keep out the light, and custom lenses as it is next to impossible to use it with eyeglasses.  The $300.00 toy quickly became a $500.00 mistake.  Thanks to Amazon's exceptional return policy I was able to send it all back for free with my Prime benefits.  From what I experienced I think it will be a few more years before VR is truly ready for mainstream use.

HOWEVER, the build quality is not as great as the Quest 1. They're kind of going the Quantity over Quality route.I've owned the Quest 1, HP Reverb G2, and Valve Index. Unfortunately, I had to downscale so I sold my index and got a Quest 2. This is how I look at it.First off, the face cover... it feels like cheap memory foam they pulled out of a car's seats. Within 5 seconds, my face felt like it did on the Quest 1 in an hour long gaming session. The new covers fix that, but man, I never thought I'd miss the old cover so much. The old ones honestly felt decent. Not too premium, not too rough. It honestly felt like I was rubbing a fine sponge on my face, first time using this thing.The controllers also look worse. They feel the same as the older ones, but they look like they were put together in a rush. On the older controllers, there were barely any noticeable gaps in the plastic, but they are SO obvious here. EDIT : New note; Tracking somehow seems worse... I'd say 3/4 times I use the headset, my Tracking is lost while I'm playing in a pretty well lit and detailed room. The Tracking of the controllers also seems worse. Functionally, it is the same. But Tracking on the Quest 1 definitely felt much smoother.The head strap is part downgrade/part neutral. I find it good that you can upgrade them, but we're talking about the base straps. The Quest 2 straps pinch your hair, if you've just recently cut them and they also chew on your ears. Of this whole experience I've had with the Quest 2, it's been my ears that have been the most annoyed. Audio is also lopsides, with my left hearing more than right. I'm gonna assume this can be resolved with some kind of RMA, but I'm fine with this.The software somehow also feels like a downgrade (or over complication and under complication). In the older versions (Quest 1 versions), you could find most things on one tab and basic functions were in submenus. Everything is all over the place now, and settings is placed in the library like an app... that's just weird. Also, the controllers... they represent where your fingers are a lot less than the older ones. It's a small detail, but it got me so immersed in the Quest 1. It doesn't sit well with me, but it's a minor problem.Lastly, IPD adjustment... I guess it's not that big of a deal, but I'd have preferred a 'by the millimeter' system. It does its job though.As for pros of this headset, there's a lot...1. It's a cheap entry into VR and you won't even need a PC.2. Oculus Software is usually pretty clean (I don't like how it changed so much, but I'll get used to it.)3. You can play PCVR with it.4. It generally improved on its predecessor, and at a lower cost.5. You can upgrade comfort.Would I recommend it? If you're willing to ignore facebook being a requirement, yeah. It's still a versatile headset, regardless of it's downsides.

I’m so incredibly pleased with this headset, if you are looking to do pcvr it is better than a rift S and i highly recommend you get this one instead of it, if you aren’t looking to do pcvr it is still so incredible. the graphics aren’t insanely great but they are very good for what it is especially at its price.

I purchased 2 Oculus Quest 2’s for my boys for Christmas. It is an incredibly cool gift & the boys enjoy them more than any other gaming system they’ve had, however, less than a week later one of the remotes has stopped working properly. Most of the time when you push the joystick forward to move forward you don’t move at all. It’s like there’s a short in the joystick. This renders the Quest 2 useless & it’s disappointing & frustrating for the main Christmas gift to stop working in less than a week. I will update my review after I contact the manufacturer. enjoy them more than any other gaming system they’ve had, however, less than a week later one of the remotes has stopped working properly.

I was unable to register this because it requires a facebook account and mine was hacked a few months ago. The instructions specifically mention not making a new account. I reached out to oculus support who filed a ticket. It has been 30 days now and only a week ago did facebook contact me but no reply from facebook since I sent in my documentation proving it is my account. so beware if your facebook is hacked it might take longer than the return window to fix the issue. Perhaps wait to buy it until extended return window starts for the holidays. I am hoping it will eventually be fixed.2nd star was because it does seem REALLY cool, the part I could do until i had to register it, it is comfortable and looks nice, but I havent been able to use it.

My PC is new and more then powerful enough, everything is updated.1/5 time the quest will just decide it’s not going to link up… cable or not..I bought Virtual desktop and it worked, but now the quest won’t pair with steam VR …It’s always somthing.. troubleshooting .. re starts, re boots, instal uninstall etc.. the thing is a pain in the butt…But makes since being Face book…

I bought one of these in February of 2021. The left controller went bad after about two weeks of intermittent use, maybe 2-3 hours per day of use. Changed the batteries, same issue. Got a refund.Decided to try it again in September because it has some cute ideas - especially the movie theater settings you get with youtube or prime video. Maybe I just got a dud that one time?After about eight hours of use in total over the course of one week, I start it up to find out it has fans going absolutely nuts, and it gives me this window on startup that says it's overheating and needs to be removed for safety reasons while it shuts itself off. Unusable after a week??Safe to assume any replacements will also screw up in some form or another after a very brief stretch of time.

I am a CV1 owner (Original Oculus Rift), I love my Rift...and will not part with it. I now have the best of both Oculus worlds. That said, the Quest 2 is a stellar piece of engineering with unbelievable software support from Facebook. I was amazed with all the entertainment available to the Quest 2 that is not available to the PC based Rift. Now I am going to list the accessories I bought that will bring this miraculous piece of technology to a stellar level. You can thank me later. Everything can be bought right here on Amazon.1) The Bobo MR2 pro Head strap with battery (Purchase an extra battery for unlimited playtime $29) $59.992)The Odio one headphones (same specs as the $99 Logitech headphones endorsed by Oculus) I purchased for $19 used (new $34) incredible sound.3) The Aukeer 3.5mm Audio Cable $6.99 (Short audio cable for Headphones),4) A MOBOREST 1/4'' (6.35mm) Audio cable adapter $6.995)  If you intend to use for PCVR, the Syntech Link Cable 16 FT ($21.89)These accessories will turn your Quest 2 into a VR Beast. Purchase the above for less than the pro elite strap with battery from Oculus (not including the link cable). There is no comparison with the quality and value of the above items as opposed to the Oculus product.The Oculus Quest 2 as a modern VR competitor and console has no peer.

So, Oculus Quest 2 requires Facebook account. I never had one so I created it just to use this device. And a hour later my account got banned for allegedly violating something. I used my real name, email and date of birth, and didn't use it for anything except setting up my oculus. I didn't finish connecting it to PC though, and now I can't login into Oculus Link app.Now in order to recover my Facebook account they ask me for my phone and photo. How does my photo helps you confirm that is my account, if account is completely empty? And they say that they can and will use your phone in whatever way they can, you can't opt out of that. This is more than I intended to give them.Whatever, I did fill the form, provided whatever data they ask. My account is not yet unlocked, so I can't use the device I paid for. I guess I don't really own it.TL;DR If you don't have an active Facebook account, don't buy this device. If you think you can just create one, you might get the same issues I have and end up having a useless brick.

Furthermore, I cannot change the account my Oculus is merged with.  Therefore this device I just spent hundreds of dollars on I can no longer use.  This whole situation has been a complete nightmare, and I have received no help from Facebook or Oculus.  I will never purchase another Oculus device period!

I'm coming from a samsung gear VR, so I have a little experience with VR in general.  While the quest 2 is way more powerful with its hardware and 6 degrees of movement, it REALLY lacks in the comfort / usability department in my opinion.My old gear vr had a manual focus dial that you could adjust on the fly, and once you did worked really well considering.  The quest doesn't have this, all it has are three different width positions to set the lenses to.  The type of lenses used have a very small sweet spot for clarity, so if your not set correctly with one of those 3 positions, too bad, beause thats it.  Thats the only adjustment you have with the lenses.If you wear glasses, your about to have a bad time.  The face piece is very narrow width wise, so even using the added adapter for glasses use, it was literally almost like I was forcing my glasses through the unit.  I don't have extra large frames or anything like that either, just standard stuff.  I have contacts, but that just seems like a bad design.  I don't want to switch from my glasses to contacts JUST to use my headset.  It IS possible to purchase prescription lenses for the quest 2, but thats just another added expense.Theres also noticeable light bleed at the nose area with the headset on.The software is fine, works really well for the little time I used it.  Unfortunately the hardware issues with the lenses were a no go for me, and I ended up returning it.

This a fun toy to view videos attend concerts, Billie Eilish was very cool and I’m sure play games. The problem is it’s not well balanced, it becomes very uncomfortable after a short period of time. And, it gets hot! You will constantly be adjusting the headset. Now they supply a silicone covering for the foam around the facile part that goes against your face. It makes your face sweat and slides down even when you have adjusted the Quest to your head and face. There isn’t any circulation and it also sometimes fogs up the lenses. So, I purchased the Elite strap which adds more weight, but is supposed to stabilize the headset. Meh!Really what they need to do is reduce the weight of the product. So much weight up front makes the headset uncomfortable after a short period of time. Someone suggested to purchase the Elite Strap with extra battery pack on the back. This is good if you want to extend gaming time, but adds more weight to the headset. Do I really want to add more weight to an already heavy headset? I don’t think so. Again it’s an ingenious wireless gaming product/toy I hope in the future they figure out how to reduce the weight by miniaturizing the contents of the headset. I gave 3 stars because it’s amazing technology, however it’s not perfect by an stretch. Game on!

Honestly, this is a really fun device to play with. Unfortunately, my eyes don't match the ipd (Inter Pupillary Distance). Because of this, all I see is nothing but a blurry screen through the adjustable lenses. Inter Pupillary Distance means the distance between both your eyes. By the looks of it, I'm between 70-72. If your ipd is between 58-68, I highly recommend giving the headset a try. If it's over 70, stay away from it. Really tragic too. I actually did have fun with this device. But there's no point in keeping it if I can't see through it properly. Hopefully in the future, if Oculus makes an Oculus quest 2 pro, or a new headset, they increase the ipd so I can actually use it properly.

Immediately after putting it on, I felt super disoriented, and taking it off, I felt super cross-eyed. There was a fish-eye distortion on objects in VR as well.I got it replaced, and did not have this issue at all with the new unit.So be warned, there are quality control issues with these.

Why would I use a quest when I have an Index? Because my index has a big cable sticking out of the back, and if I get sweaty, the comfortable foam around the headpiece and face mask sucks up all my sweat and seals it in. I don't want a stanky headset.The quest comes with a silicon gasket that goes over the foam. It doesn't feel great at first but you get used to it. And the first time you get sweaty doing a VR work out, and find you can clean the sweat with a napkin and it just wipes off that silicone, you will understand why it's superior to fabric or foam. It's super easy to keep clean. So you can go ballistic in beatsaber, get 30 min of cardio, and not worry about stinking up your headset.The display is also really good, seems higher resolution than my Index, definitely easy to use it as a web browser, watch movies, etc.The on board audio is nowhere near as good as real headphones or the Index audio, but its perfectly adequate for gaming, although you do have to crank the volume to 100%. Also, at high volume, bass tends to move air near your temples, which tickles. You'll be playing beat saber and suddenly feel like a bug is crawling on your forehead when the bass drops.The strap it comes with is trash. Throw it away the first chance you get and buy the elite strap with battery.The power cable it comes with is too short to use while playing.The controllers are comfortable and feel better than the Reverb G2's larger and more plasticy feeling ones. As a bonus, they only use 1 AA battery and I get WEEKS of battery life with daily use. My Reverb G2 goes through 2 AA's in a single long play session and I get at most a few days of use out of it. It also doesn't like rechargables and wants alkalines so it gets $$$. The quest controllers last forever on 1 battery.The experimental features really make the Quest fun. The hand tracking works really well, allowing you to use the headset on a bus, plane, or in public without breaking out the controllers. You won't be gaming with it, but you can browse the web and watch movies without the need for controllers.The pass through video is as good as the Valve Index except it's in black and white only. But you get a very natural feeling 3d video experience that allows you to double tap the headset, and instantly see your room with natural 3d depth perception. I can walk around the house with the headset on and not worry about hitting stuff.The quest versions of popular games are graphically simpler than steam versions, and you have to buy games you already own a 2nd time, but it's worth it for the un-cabled awesome that is the VR exercise regimen.Get an hour of cardio a day and not feel like you're working out. Quest will keep your brain and your body younger longer.

I had a bit of trouble setting it up to work with SteamVR, but eventually, I figured it outMore specifically, I didn't understand at first how the main Oculus interface and the Oculus desktop app are correlated with each other; only then I discovered that I had to get the Virtual Desktop app from the Oculus store on the main interface, not through the desktop appI also put on the silicon thing for the face, and while it helps quite a bit, it's not perfect; sometimes the headset just pushes against the nose a little too much, so I have to adjust itOverall, the price for wireless SteamVR gaming is well worth it!EDIT Oct 12, 2021Eventually, I figured out how to play SteamVR games over Oculus Link/Air Link: after enabling the feature (in the desktop app under Beta and in the headset under Experimental), you need to add each game manually via the desktop app, and then in the headset, from within the Link interface, go to Library, making sure to show in the filter Unknown Sources, and your game(s) will appear thereHowever, keep in mind that some games will take some trial and error to adapt for accurate tracking (for me, it was Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality)

Yes people, it's once again that time of year where we are all eating celery, drinking water and using our gym memberships and dusty exercise bikes! We also have an older X-Box 360 Kinect, which we use for Zumba, Dance and other games that really help you work up a sweat. Between weights, treadmill, elliptical and the X-Box we feel like we have plenty of options to keep us working out 3-4 times a week until we give up in April! (let's be realistic).Anyhow, the X-box is getting a little finicky so we decided to look for a newer model. Sure, you can get the X-Box One, which is now a generation old, with the Kinect camera, but Microsoft isn't offering the Kinect option with the newer X-Box X. I saw an Oculus commercial and decided to do some research.After looking at the 3-4 popular VR options, the Quest seemed like the no-brainer. There is PS-VR, which requires a PS5 (good luck finding one, and by itself it's 2x the price of the Quest 2) and you still have to buy the PS VR headset itself. Interestingly enough it works with a camera on the PS5 that looks similar to the Kinect camera. There are other VR headsets out there that are rated highly, and may have more gaming power and resolution, but they are 3-4x as expensive as the Quest 2.So I bought a Quest 2, some important accessories (Anker charging station, silicone cover for the foam face cover, and an upgraded headset with integrated extended life battery) and started surfing.First of all, if you think VR is cheesy or not-enveloping, poke around and look at ""Conquer Your Fear of Heights"" or ""Shark Attack"". Your eyes can really fool the rest of your body when you're in VR! Second, the games on this are lightning quick with accurate representation of your movements in real time. You can watch YouTube or Amazon Prime VR programming, surf the web, and find all sorts of neat VR stuff through the headset.After demoing some games and poking around, I decided to purchase Beat Saber. I know, this is not a 'deep cut' but within 20 minutes I was addicted. Who knew cutting neon boxes to the sounds of electronica would be so fun??Skeptical you can get a good workout in VR? Go to volume 3 or 4 or the extras section of Beat Saber and do 20 minutes. Within 20 minutes I'm sweating (that's why you get the silicone protector) heart was beating 110 BPM and my Apple Watch recorded a dance workout where I burned 350 calories and got 3400 steps. If you set the difficulty higher (from Easy to Normal, for instance) it's like running faster on a treadmill; you get a better workout because you're just chopping away at boxes, dodging walls, ducking, and at times you feel like a rock drummer as you crash boxes to the rhythm of those electronic beats.Would I use this as my only exercise option? Probably not, but does it feel like I'm trudging away on a treadmill, just waiting for it to be over? Not at all! 20-30, even 75 (!) minutes goes by so fast when you're in the zone, just crushing your old high-score.This isn't a Beat Saber review, but just one example of a cool ""fitness game"" you can play. There is also Dance Central, Audica, and many other enveloping VR options where you really get yourself moving.You can pay a lot of money for fitness equipment or game consoles, so I feel like the $299 I spent on this and the additional $150 of accessories was easily worth the price. Everyone who comes over uses it and loves it so I feel like in 2 weeks we've already got our money's worth from it. You don't NEED the accessories either. We used it for a couple of days with only what came in the box and it was fine. The accessories just make it a bit more convenient and comfortable.

I loved it so much that I didn’t want to give his headset back when he got home so I had to buy my own. I play at least an hour of beat saber every single day and I have lost almost 24 pounds since. This is the most fun I’ve had working out ever. I don’t even realize that I’m burning so many calories because I’m having so much fun. I love that you can play online with other people and compete against them.I also bought the Walk Around mini golf game which is really fun and nice and relaxing except for when they drop you on top of the cliff. It really does feel like you’re standing on top of a cliff which can be a little unnerving at first.I think the only complaint that I have is the strap for the headset. It’s very difficult to keep this on your head unless you have a ponytail you can tuck under the strap to make it tighter. I ended up buying an elite strap for my son and I and while I didn’t like having to shell out the extra money so that we could actually play with the VR headsets, it’s still worth it.

I got my order super fast.  Literally about 24 hours. When I got it I went to set it up and noticed the serial number was Different than what was printed on the box. When looking through the lenses on the right hand side there was what looked like a blue ribbon About an inch long that wouldn’t go away. I was also not able to set it up I couldn’t get past the five digit code screen even though it said my quest was registered an active. Was sent back I got the new one today and will try it when I get home.EDIT:  I got my new quest and what a difference. The box was actually shrink wrapped unlike the other box I got that was not.  the serial numbers also matched. Are use the new quest for about 30 minutes and it was awesome. But I’m leaving this review at one star because they sent me a returned product that didn’t work. I suggest you go to Best Buy or some other store  to buy this and not Amazon. I will be rethinking how I order things.

Bought this to play pc vr games on, it my first headset and was somewhat hesitant since it was technically a standalone unit. Waited for a while and watched reviews on it and finally splurged and purchased it. Just in the main ""room"" I was in awe. Played the tutorial and was in awe... Once I played some pc vr I was in a whole another world. I have been playing it with the air link and have had no issues with it. First title I played was Hellblade: Senua's Sacrafice because I already had it and it was already an amazing game on just the monitor. Hooooollly crap! I was not expecting it to be that much more amazing it in vr! Bought more pc vr games since then and have not been disappointed! Most recent was Half-Life: Alyx and so far seems extraordinary! I highly recommend this headset. Only downside is Facebook.

The Quest2 is acceptable for its price. Although you will have to spend quite a bit extra for a link cable, a headstrap upgrade, some nice earbuds/headphones, and so on. The controllers are surprisingly good, but nowhere near as good as the Valve Index ""Knuckles"" Controllers. The Quest2 will not give you the ultimate experience, but it will get you into VRchat or Beat Saber on a budget.Normally, I'd give this headset around a 4/5, but there's 1 little issue. You must have a Facebook account, and you must link your Quest2 to your smartphone. You have to hand over basically all of your personal information just to use the thing, and currently there's no method to completely avoid this process. It's a massive violation of privacy, and unacceptable for a piece of hardware to require from its users.Yes, you can give false information, but you risk getting banned and unable to use your headset anymore. Yes, there are ways to deal with all of this, but you must be very tech-savvy and be willing to invest hours into setting things up - and even then, there's always the chance of a stealth update ruining your whole set-up.So yes, it's a decent headset, but even if it was literally free I would be hesitant to recommend it to anyone because of the Facebook integration.

It's a fun all in one VR but it's not a big jump from the Go version like you would think. It's worth buying for gaming but if you just like to watch VR and not a big gamer then I would just buy the Go. The PQ is not alot better and you would only notice if you side by side the quest2 and Go to see it. Sound hands down is better on the Go it has more of a surround FX and is clearer in sound over all then the quest 2 only thing quest 2 has over the Go in sound it has way more bass. Some apps I like on the Go are not on the quest 2 which I see as dumb because you would understand if the Go could not play quest 2 apps then okay because you would think the Go does not have the better video card,processor or whatever but for the quest 2 not to have Go apps you had before is just dumb and shows lack of backwards compatible from oculus. I was very dispointed with the Oculus quest 2 out of the box because I was thinking it was going to be blowing the Oculus Go out of the water in every which way but it does not. Onces your over the dispointment like I was it's not bad the quest 2 if you look at it as it's just different then the Go and not as better. Quest 2 you need to change refresh rate to 120hz in setting and you can get a third party app to help changes more setting to make the quest 2 have a better PQ so keep that in mine you can YouTube all that if you want to know more. I don't like some things on the quest 2 seem like a down grade from the Go version like Sound,there no sound volume numbers anymore like 1 to 15 on the Go,there no display brightness anymore,the power and sound buttons in a different location then the Go and there not in a better spot I think,even the charging light is now in a dumb spot which is on the side of the quest 2 so now you have to pick it up to see if it's charged or tilt your head to see it when on the Go it's right on top of it so boom you can see it a mile away without picking it up it's charged,head strip is more uncomfortable on the quest 2 then the Go out of the box yes you can get a upgraded strip with added battery from Oculus but that extra money. There was just some dumb moves made by Oculus on the quest 2 but not saying there where not go moves made too like the controls there are two they track your hands and you do not need to even uses controls at times because you can track your own hands. The extra cameras on the quest 2 are nice you can tap the side of the Quest 2 to turn them on to see where your going and not have to remove the VR off your face,you can now walk in VR walk and look around more way better then the Go version there. You can adjust your eye lens good move there. Is it super faster then the Go no but it is a faster VR all in one then the Go which still helps in fast moving gaming. So get the quest 2 if you game and play more games then watch VR but if your just a VR watcher like using it to sit in a roller coaster,looking at mountain,look at shows,movies,plays,magic shows and etc..... Just things you sit and watch then buy the Go and save lots of money you do not need the quest 2.

I am an avid gamer and was drawn in to VR after a buddy told me about the Occy Quest 2. Right away I can say there is a lot of value here for $299. Unlike other VR systems, you don't need a computer or anything to use this. You just need an internet connection to install some games. There is also a lot of free content and demos that can be enjoyed as you start to get a feel for being in a VR environment. So far I have said a lot of positive things so why a 1/5 star review? Here is what you don't realize until after you use a VR headset...This gives you motion sickness. People will argue on the severity but the community of players will collectively agree that this is not something you can just bring with you on a family holiday visit, and strap your uncle, aunt, mom, dad, grandpa, and grandma into without causing them to want to throw up their lunch/dinner after 5min.When I first started thinking about VR, I remembered back to the Nintendo Wii. I put the Nintendo Wii controls into my family members hands and they bowled, played baseball, boxing, etc and thought it was fun. None of them felt like puking afterwards. However I can't replicate that same gimmicky nostalgia that the Nintendo Wii offered us 10 yrs ago with this Occy Quest 2. The VR experience is just too intense for most people. You have to be extremely careful about how you show this to people that have no prior VR experience.If your thought process was, I want the Occy Quest 2 for myself but also to show off to all my family/friends so they think it is the greatest thing since sliced bread, you will likely be tremendously disappointed with the results.If you do have a group of people that you want to show this to that you feel are able to handle it, then this is how I would suggest setting up..Step one is the get into the VR yourself and create a stationary boundary from a seated position. A sturdy chair that someone can sit it while in VR.Next, you will cast your Occy Quest 2 to a TV or laptop so you can spoon feed the VR user step-by-step directions on where to navigate.Next, you will have them get into the VR and launch First Steps for Quest app. This is a simple tutorial with a very calm environment. Easy for a beginner to get comfortable with the controls and try a couple simple VR novelty tricks like picking up and throwing some blocks, paper airplanes, shooting ray guns, etc.Once they are done with this First Steps for Quest, you should encourage them to stop playing. This is usually a tipping point for a new user where their brain is going to start fighting with their stomach and rejecting this VR experience. VR motion sickness is not fun and can last awhile. If you jump on Youtube and look up ""VR sadness"" or ""VR depression"" you can hear people talk about the disassociation with reality working in conjunction with their motion sickness that new users experience with VR making them feel like depressed garbage for the rest of the day or even for a day or two. Don't let new users get to this point hahaIf the person insists on wanting more, I would have them check out VR Animations App. You should already have a couple neat saved animations that they can jump into and look at. This is a fun program to showcase the cool little things that VR can offer and it really is a cool visual experience. Be careful to avoid animations that spin, rotate, or give the feeling that the VR user is in motion (example: sitting in or next to a car that is driving down a road).Overall, this is really a neat device. I think VR is going to be around for awhile or some version of it. We are quickly going to see VR headset power and resolution make huge leaps and bounds in the next couple years. I predict that someday soon you will no longer furnish your living room at home with speakers, TVs, big sectional couches, etc. to watch your TV shows and movies. Instead you relax somewhere comfortable and slip on your VR headset and be transported to some massive movie theatre in space, sitting next to popcorn guzzling aliens, and watching some 3D animated movie off of Amazon Prime Video VR or other subscription based service.and as interesting, amazing, or terrifying as this may sound not everyone is going to be able to handle this level of stimulation. So VR wisely! Scale your expectations appropriately! and good luck out there!

This VR Headset for a birthday gift is turning into an expensive gift I don't have the time or money for. After the headset, you basically need to hell out another 80$ for this cable and then another 10-15$ for an adaptor for the COMPUTER you need to connect it too. Why does it not come with adaptors?Beginning to think if I dig deep enough I will find that Apple owns Oculus and that will explain all of the gadgets and doo-dads I need to buy to get anything to literally work.Will be leaving same review on the stupid 80$ cable had to buy to get it working too

After a week of using the Oculus Quest 2, I allowed my son to play some of the social apps such as Horizon Worlds and Rec Room. Within that day he was suspended for the Horizon Worlds app, and the following morning I woke to find that Oculus had suspended my account for 24 hours.The suspension ‘bricked’ the $300 dollar headset. Even the games I’ve purchased were not available, even if they were solo games which have no social aspect to it. The suspension came after an email was sent to me stating that the account violated the code of conductI will admit that I have one of those kids who can shut up if his life depended on it, and that in social situations he is that bubbly kid who will friend anyone and rattle off about all kinds of kid stuff. This can be considered annoying (I admit it is annoying, and I love my kid unconditionally). I’m certain his behavior found him being reported, and the report resulted in the suspension.Oculus customer support is absolutely horrible. The chat feature simply regurgitated to me what I just told them. Imagine answering a question and then the person trying to answer your question with your answer. That was Santiago G… customer service rep numero uno.So here I sit… with a $300 brick and some fancy hand controllers which do nothing and no explanation can be provided. Needless to say I’m returning this and hoping for a refund. Probably won’t get a single penny on any of the games I purchased. Save your money… get your kid a Nintendo switch.

Product is great, is how Amazon handled their Black Friday promotion of a $50 credit being the reason why this is one star. I added the Oculus too my cart to decide if I wanted to use Amazon or another store (Target and Bestbuy was running the same promotion). I Purchased through Amazon because there were other products I wanted to purchase from Amazon as well.I read on Amazon site that sometimes it takes a few weeks for promotion to apply, which didn’t make much sense but ok, I decided to wait. 2 weeks go by and I reach out for Amazon for support. Basically, “Nicolas” was not any help and basically said since I didn’t do an “Instant Buy”, the promotion did not apply. Honestly, I don’t even remember if I did instant buy or not, because I did remove the Oculus from my cart before changing my mind. Basically, Amazon support is saying that I will not receive the promotion credit when at any time did I read you must do an “Instant Buy” to receive it. I also have a friend who experienced the same issue with Amazon.So the product itself is 5 stars, how Amazon handled the promotional aspect is a 1 star, and I will be returning and contemplating using Amazon for future purchases.

As you should know already, Facebook is required. While trying to log into Facebook I got stuck in an endless loop of logging in. Oculus support recommended trying a different device so I logged into my computer with Facebook and got completely locked out of my account of 12 years for trying to log into an unrecognized device. So. I have a 300 brick and can't access any of my personal info on Facebook. Thanks, Meta. Don't waste your time or money.

To get right to the point, I cannot recommend this device. While it did eventually get set up, there are unneeded hoops to jump through that cause problems both on the technical side and on the trust side.To set up, you are required to have or open a Facebook account. I get that Facebook bought Oculus, so that's where it stems from, but there is no valid technical reason for this requirement. Why is this needed? Simply to boost FB registration numbers? To make a grab for personal info? It does not inspire trust.The second irritating, unnecessary hoop is requiring you to install a mobile device app and to pair the headset. I ran into problems with this which took using a second phone to get it accomplished. Thankfully the household had a second device available to use. Then, once that was finally done it seems unneeded any more since the headset works without doing anything on that paired phone. Tech support told me that my mesh wifi could be the problem. Really? All a mesh wifi does is present a single SSID to devices connecting to it, how can that interfere?Ultimately it did get working, and tech support was responsive, so it gets a second star for that.

I've had a Facebook account for over 11 years that was previously linked to my Oculus Go around 3 years ago.  I got my Quest a few days ago and when I try to log into the Oculus app with Facebook it just spins.  Customer support said it was a known issue but offered no resolution or a time frame.

Fantastic, I had no idea that I could work out inside and burn so many calories. I run, I cycle, but I never burned after a 40 minutes workout. I downloaded Supernatural, the Fitness app, and I burned 640 calories after 30 minutes of workout. I had to squat, punch, and destroy objects and my arms are sore already. I love the oculus and I will subscribe to the Supernatural app with no doubt. It is like having a full gym inside your home.For the Oculus in general, it is great, of course, I could not wear it for a long time because it leaves me heavy marks on my face and scalp but holy darn, I saw myself in a Total Recall movie. The technology is simply amazing and watching videos in 360 is so amazing. I think this has been the best purchase of my last 10 years without a doubt.I would recommend it - Keep in mind if you wear glasses or lenses you will need those or you won't be able to see well on your oculus.Buy it, I am sure you will love it.

The controllers feel cheap and the headset moves too much when I shake my head even when tightened. The biggest deal-breaker is that they require Facebook to use it and if you get banned from Facebook you lose everything you purchased. The field of view is also really disappointing as it feels smaller than looking through a telescope. Overall I'm very unhappy with this purchase and would recommend other brands like the Index over this.

Don't let anyone tell you the rift or rift s is better than this for PC.. this is the best bang for the buck and the image quality and refresh rate is superior to both the rift and rift s. I haven't had tracking issues once and I've been playing wirelessly via virtual desktop exclusively because airlink kinda sucks.. and the link cable I bought randomly disconnects but virtual desktop works flawlessly and I don't notice any latency, then again I'm playing 3 feet from the router.. the stock headband sucks as many others have mentioned as well as the face pad so I upgraded both. The speakers are okay, they're not as bad as everyone makes them out to be but I will be installing a headphone mod on mine. One issue I have is that sometimes the software will freeze when I try to multi task, responding to a Facebook message while streaming my PC for example but a reboot fixes it.. still annoying though.

Let me preface this by saying, I've never been a video game player, just not my thing. I got this for Christmas, and all I can say is...Wow. As a former ping-pong player in my youth, I decided to give the game a shot. It is so immersive, standing in the middle of the room with the table in front of you, it feels so real. It is so realistic that I keep finding myself wanting to lean on the table for certain shots, big mistake; you need to remind yourself that the environment isn't real. Moved on to golf. Once again, you are standing in the middle of the golf course with 360-degree views of the entire scene, it's incredible.  I've only had this a few days, but if what I've seen so far is any indication, I am a video game person. I just had to find the correct format. Love it.

I love this, though I wish it were a bit wider for use with glasses, and I wish they sold replacement cushions for it more inexpensively as I am sweating. Otherwise, it's nearly perfect! This is a very polished experience.Wireless is super important. While I did get the pricey link cable for use with my PC, and I will be playing PC games on this headset, I underestimated how much better it is to be wireless. I will explore the Airline (wireless PC connection) too, but again using this with a PC adds a layer of complexity. If you want to use this by itself for a quick session, that's where it really shines as it's easy to put on and go.While Oculus is owned by Facebook, and they're begging for government regulation, AND the default sharing settings are too leaky for my taste, I am willing to compromise. I see this as my first, but not last, VR system. I will upgrade in a few years as technology improves, and will consider a different company's platform then. But for now this is a great way to try out VR.The apps are well done and include usual video apps from youtube, amazon prime, and netflix. I am using a few inexpensive games, mostly for fitness and that's working well. You can use transparency mode to set up a virtual safe zone so you can move freely and it'll let you know if you are going out of it. Just very impressive how well it all works.With regard to glasses, I use an older pair that are narrow and fit better. I don't use the included silicone face pad cover because that does get caught on the smaller glasses and that's not good. So, if it's sweaty I detach the face pad and clean it...but I foresee that it won't last forever. Replacements seem to be pricy but I will also experiment with aftermarket ones. A side benefit to this being such a big selling product is that there are numerous third party accessories for it.

I was an early adopter of PSVR.  Over the years I played it less and less, just because it was a hassle to set up.  Not that it was hard, just that it was annoying.The fact that Quest 2 is standalone and no wires is EXACTLY why it's so amazing.  I've had it for nearly 2 months now and I play it every day.  Sometimes multiple times a day.I use it for workouts, which I didn't know was even a thing.  If I can be tricked into physical activity, great!I also having been using Virtual Desktop to tap into my PC so I can run Steam VR.  It works perfectly, all wireless.  128GB is plenty of space if you are debating.Here's an example of a major improvement.  My daughter would use PSVR and I would need to be near to make sure she wouldn't hit the TV or something and have to help her not get tangled up with the cord.  Now with Oculus I set up a Guardian so she can clearly see the invisible walls I set for her and no longer need to untangle her from cords.  You can also stream to a TV using Chromecast or the phone app so you can see what the user is seeing.  The app also gives you control to help them launch games or reset their position.  These improvements are HUGE!I've been BLOWN AWAY how much better the Quest 2 is over older VR headsets, especially PSVR.  Everything looks better and plays with better controls.  I can't see this going down the same road with PSVR where I stop using it, it's just really really good.

The biggest drawback with this headset is the weak USB port and other charging issues. It doesn't take much pressure to break that USB port and once you break it, u might as well throw the whole headset away because there is absolutely no way to repair or replace it. Check the internet for all of the complaints concerning the headset's charging issues and you'll see what I mean. My headset lasted for about 2 months and with the continuous charging, eventually the port became weak and broke and the cable started melting the headset housing around the USB port to the point that it completely stopped charging. Never again will I buy another Oculus headset. A waste of $300.

Likes:-Games are good! Plenty to choose from.-Audio is ok. You can enable Bluetooth earbuds/headphones-VR is in par with Playstation VR but better since you can create a safe space (guardian) and walk around in VR vice just sitting or standing with PSVR.-Quality is good. Combination of plastic and elastics. Not heavy and can play for 3hrs with minimum neck fatigue.-Sickness? Not that bad depending on game/video. For the most part I only felt sick when playing seated. Watching videos didn’t make me sick at all. Now for the bad.-Facebook: Not so much of a bad but more of a why. Seems a bit sketchy having a system with cameras all around watching your home as you traverse on a VR environment. Guardian safe zone? More like now I know your living space and where you spend most the time. Also thanks for the cool interior pics of your house.- Price: I can see myself playing this for a little bit, not as often as my home console. Not that I will stop playing it, but more like not worth $299.99 playing every day type. FYI I got the $200 discount from the Amazon credit card so I only payed $109.00ish.-Head Strap: By far the worst thing this VR headset has. Not only is it uncomfortable but seems like it will break anytime in the near future. Everything points to OCULUS wants you to buy their premium strap.-Battery life: Depending on use you can squeeze like 2.5-3 tops on hours of playtime. This is if you are moderate with what you got turned on and turn it fully off when not in use.I will keep updating this review as time goes by as we all know this was a hot XMas present in 2021. Pandemic and all everyone is down to do some indoor travel a la VR Mode.

This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my 12yo daughter. It is a huge hit, not only for her, but her Dad and I have had a blast on it also! Once you have the headset on it feels like you are really in the VR game you are playing. As a parent I like you set perimeters of the room you are playing in and once you leave the set perimeters the game pauses and you can see where you are in the room. This is a great safety feature, especially if you are playing in a room with a lot of obstacles or stairs. Set up was easy, we did have to set up a Facebook account, which I wasn't thrilled about. But, once it is set up it is managed from the VR headset or the app. She has had a blast playing gorilla tag with a couple of her school friends that got the Oculus as well.

Maybe it's because I live in a studio apartment with my elderly, dementia parent. Maybe it's because I'm not interested in getting outside as much due to covid. Or maybe it's inflation. Whatever the reason or excuse, I LOVE the escape these glasses give me.It's addictive!To feel snuggly, alone, and transported is SOO AWESOME!I not only visit other countries, but I love going under water, or overhead with a drone sky-view of the world.I love the feel of the rollercoaster rides. So funny how our minds can cause physical reactions. Love it! Don't get that belly-drop feel, any more - belly's too fat - but I do get a wonderful dizzy feel when descending down the rollercoaster.Watching TV or Prime/Netflix is synonymous to being in my own media room, curled up and cozy.I haven't played any games yet.As interested as I am in AI, the introduction robot creeped me the heck out because it looked me in my eyes and danced with me, responded to my dance movements. How is that possible? Or is that a real human, drawn to look like a colorful stick figure? Rushed through that and never returned.Very meditative. You will fall asleep with this on, several times.I wait till my parent is sleep then I indulge, but since she likes to compete with me - once again proving how young she really is (sigh), I only use once every two weeks. At the end of the day, too tired to put on knowing I'd be snoring within seconds.You can use with Bluetooth or plugin headset, too.I've decided to gift one to someone everyone every year.Enjoy!

This unit seems to be very glitchy. I tried hooking it up to my PC and tried it solo. Games that require ""hand motion"" detect ghost controllers no matter how far away I put the real ones(even put them outside in the car trunk.) When I am hooked to my Gaming PC via airlink, it starts off great but then gets really glitchy within minutes.  The virtual desktop and VR navigation seems to disappear and reappear out of reach...at will. Also, the Oculus Store is inaccessible then it's accessible...then inaccessible again only to be accessible for another brief window only to be inaccessible yet again...you get the idea.My PC is running at around 12% maximum disk use and 110-120 processes. I am running a 10th gen i9 with a dedicated video card and 32gb of RAM...so, if it's not going to work airlinked because my hardware isn't up to snuff then it should not be listed that it's wirelessly PC compatible at all.I ordered a 10ft ultra high speed USB C to USB C data cable to see if it works better when physically tethered. The unit comes with what seems like an intentionally short USB C charging cable in an attempt to sell their way overpriced 10 ft cable. So...we'll see in a few days when the cable arrives.On a side note, why in the world would the manufacturer's design include a power button right underneath the strap? Every time a player tries to physically adjust the headset they unintentionally close everything out only to reopen and find everything aggravatingly rearranged.I thoroughly expected to see my daughter using the headset and sailing through virtual worlds on Christmas morning and not getting so frustrated that she gave up even trying to use it.Maybe my unit is defective. If it's the same way after the new cable arrives then I intend to ask for either a refund or a working replacement.EDIT: The main reason we bought this VR setup was for Roblox VR. The high speed cable came in and VOILA! the glitchy PC connection is no more. The only issue now seems to be that we have to uninstall the headset, restart the PC and reinstall the Quest 2 headset every time we want to use it tethered. However, my daughter loves the Roblox VR play and says it rocks...so, looks like we're going to keep the unit.

What they don't tell you about the Quest 2 is that its more narrower than the previous headsets meaning that you have to force your glasses into it which doesn't provide for a very pleasant experience as the glasses dig into the side of your head, you could buy $200 VR lenses (if you have bad vision like me) which at that point I would rather like to track down a Rift S instead.Avoid if you have glasses unless you can justify buying the lenses as well, ontop of a headstrap that should have been included and a 3rd party oculus link cable.

This was a big purchase for us and wow, was it worth it.  We use it primarily for the Supernatural exercise program (requires a subscription).  If you want an incredibly fun -- positively addictive, really -- way of getting your cardio and building some muscle, this is for you.  Being new to VR, I was concerned that the Oculus setup would be difficult and that there would be a steep learning curve.  Nope.  The Oculus takes you through everything you need to do seamlessly.  We have upgraded the head strap and added grip covers (both from Kiwi) as they help keep everything in place when you are moving around as much as we are in Supernatural.  For more stationary apps, the stock setup should be fine.  One thing to be aware of if you wear glasses -- smaller frames fit fine but larger frames will get squished.  Considering the cost of eyeglasses, this is a definite consideration.  We both got prescription VR Wave lenses that fit in the Oculus and this solves that problem (about $100 each and they work amazingly well, even with strong prescriptions.)  So if you are going to just be playing fairly stationary games and don't need glasses, this $300 expenditure will probably be it.  If you want to do what we do, or wear glasses, expect to be spending a bit/lot more.  Would we buy it again?  Absolutely.

Doubt anyone will read this review but I have to say I am really into VR. If you have a gaming pc, just download desktop VR and play from your pc, you do have to have a fast router though. I tried the cable but it sucks to have a cable dangling so go wireless, you probably will lose some quality but its wireless so. Oh and Oculus does have its own wireless option to stream from PC but so far I have had less issues with destop VR, I ran into issues using oculus air-link. IDK I could be wrong anyways get this thing its dope, you don't have to just stick to the games from Oculus store, I am playing my steam games, hooked on Skyrim rn, glad i never beat it cause now it really feels like I am in the game.

Very impressed by the meta quest 2 graphics, sound, ease of use navigating is really pretty much straight forward just follow prompts and you're good to go. For a VR headset you really do get a lot of value for your money. Not to mention it's a stand alone headset, meaning no need to have your headset wired to a PC (unless you still wanna do it that way, cause you can using a link cable) but why would you want to do that? Personally I use AirLink and it works GREAT! Bringing my family of gamers together and moving is just one of the many benefits this has provided for us and with all the news surrounding the meta verse, it seems we are just starting and will only get better moving forward. 1 potentially HUGE downside for some... As of writing this review you NEED a Facebook account in order to set up your quest 2 VR headset. Fingers crossed this will be removed as a requirement in the near future. But it is still a lot of fun.

I got this for my 9 yr old son for his Christmas gift. And while I know Oculus is affiliated with Meta/Facebook, I don’t like the fact that in order to use the toy - you HAVE to have an active Facebook account. Not a throw away account like I wanted to set up.While my son loves the oculus, I find the cost of the games you can buy to be super expensive. So it makes the ability to get him a variety of games difficult. $30 on average is a tough pill to swallow after paying $300 for the device.But my biggest gripe is having to have a Facebook account to have access to the device. I believe they’re going to change it. I still hate it cause I hate Facebook.You should have an option to set up access without having Facebook. Period.Take that away? The Oculus is a good purchase since my son loves it.

I was skeptical, but my son wanted one. It is way better than you might think. I ended up getting one for myself. I can play games like mini golf with my son when he is at his mothers house. I use it mainly for exercise (supernatural) on which I am totally hooked. Best exercise innovation in a decade without a doubt. It is just so fun you don’t feel hardly any effort of getting your heart rate up to a level for aerobic fitness. In fact my main issue has been over exercising with it, even though I am pretty fit. I also use it for meditation. There are a number of apps for that. None are perfect but right now Tripp is the best. While the meditation apps don’t yet live up to the incredible production value of supernatural, nonetheless I am very impressed at how the immersive nature of VR helps shift me into a more meditative state much more rapidly and with much less effort than standard meditation - which I am quite experienced at. In summary, this is absolutely great value, great for connecting with friends and family members in multiplayer games, and most of all an excellent wellness tool for exercise and meditation. It definitely isn’t just for kids.

I've always wanted to get into Virtual Reality and the Quest 2 gave me a chance. The Quest 2 has helped me with covid restrictions as I'm a people person and being an adult with high functioning autism I can't wear face masks due to sensory issues, I can't get pixels sick or ketch anything from them. Being a furry I've always wanted a fursuit but due to my sensory issues I couldn't afford nor wear one. For some reason with the Quest 2 and VRChat I can finally enjoy my Virtual Reality life and real life.The Quest 2 has definitely helped make me a better person as I've been able to work with my communications skills and not be so shy around large groups of people. From a gaming aspect  I love the freedom of being wireless to play Beat Saber or any other game away from home the best part is if you have mobile hotspot and your game needs internet you can use your hotspot on your smartphone to play away from home. Always play in a shady preferably covered spot with the Gardian on. If it's to bright it can't track the hand controllers and could damage the Quest 2 cameras and burn the screen.I've done alot of research on the Quest 2 before I spent the money. The price point to get into VR with the Quest 2 was great compared to pc only based VR heasets which also need a high power gaming PC to work.. The Quest 2 is completely  standalone it absolutely does not need a PC to use it, it does require a Facebook account to use.The ability for the Quest 2 to be used with a PC to play PC based VR games with or without the Oculus link cable. Definitely love it being stand alone and the  wireless ability is the best. I definitely recommend getting a different headstrap though the one that comes with it can be painful to the back of your head due to the plastic adjustment things on the back of the strap.

I bought this expecting to connect to my Oculus account and share my library of compatible games I purchased for my Rift through the link cable. But since my Oculus account is tied to a different email address than my Facebook account that has been a nightmare sorting out. After communicating with Oculus Support for a few hours they have stopped responding and my account is not working still. It has been well over 8 hours since any communication from them. I wish Facebook didn't ruin Oculus, but now I guess I can move onto another platform such as HTC after I make the return.

Man, ready player one? Like I’m there once we get there ykno? And I know we’re not going to be there anytime soon but I really been wanting to try out VR; so I decided to cop one. I’d recommend, if you don’t already use VR and know your eye distance to get an app that does, because positioning this is key to a great experience.I gave it 3 stars because of the system setup between this and oculus on pc(it being two different entities) and well, maneuvering through the menu when you’re at the main menu is really laggy and choppy(I’m on 1Gbps connection) games get laggy too, it’s just overall pretty laggy and booting up after having it for like over a month now(and turning completely off after each use) it’s REALLY slow and then once in I have to wait, and wait, and wait until I can turn guardian back on because surprise it can’t be found and so like by the time I’m actually able to launch and play a game from the time I turn it on, I would say legit a 10 minute ordeal. It’s cool tho, and some games are legit, so I mean I’m only here to write this and let y’all know, I still will play it.

I was so excited to grab this when it was on sale during Black Friday.As soon as I got it, I downloaded all of the free games as well as the sideloaded games. It was such a cool experience to be able to put a headset on and become a soldier, shooting and reloading realistically with the controllers.. playing Star Wars.. you already know what I mean.But I noticed about a month of 1 hour play per day, I would take off the headset, look at my hands, and my brain would ""lag"" almost and make me feel like I was looking at my VR hands. This got progressively worse (my brain would take longer and longer to ""reset""). And with Zuckerberg asking churches to join VR, businesses, I see this as a sly ""harmless"" way that he is pushing his agenda... nothing good can come from messing with your brain/mind to the point where it gets confused if it's reality or VR- and who's to say we're not already in a simulation??

Was there a Quest or a Quest 1? I don't think so. Why did FB/Meta start at 2? I have no idea. Maybe there was a Quest 1 and it ended up on the scrapheap for some reason and we never saw it.Anyway, the BIG NEWS with the Quest 2 is that you no longer need to hook up to a laptop/PC and so no longer need an expensive graphics card. The Oculus Rift cost about the same if a bit more than the Quest 2, but to operate it, you needed a graphics card that would set you back at least several hundred dollars. Worse than that, though, that required you to have a higher end PC, so instead of, say, a $500 Dell Inspiron, you were looking at having to have, say, a $2,000 Dell XPS. That was a major roadblock to mass availability of VR that FB/Meta took away by introducing the Quest 2 and putting the Rift out to pasture.Now that all sounds very 5 stars, and maybe it should be, so why am I only giving 4 stars?1. It's not as cool as I thought it'd be and I don't use it as much as I thought I would. The games/apps cost between $9.99 and $39.99, from what I've seen, but even the most popular game, Beat Saber for $29.99, which is kind of like Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) but with a light saber, isn't that cool, even if on paper it sounds cool. It's not bad, just kinda meh.2. I don't know if it's my head or my eye placement or what, but I have a real issue with eyes strain using it and, most of all, with getting double vision I can't resolve no matter what I do, namely repositioning the headset and adjusting how far apart lenses inside are. Now, I do wear glasses and thought it might've been because of that and because of the spacer for glasses wearers provided with the Quest 2 to allow extra room inside the headset for glasses, so since I can see OK without glasses, no like I'm blind or anything, I tried taking that spacer out and going without glasses, same thing. For whatever reason, I can see just as well without my glasses in the headset, so that's good, but the issue of eye strain and occasional double vision that I can't resolve is exactly the same.3. The spacer for eyeglasses leaves a small open space or gap between the spacer and the body of the Quest 2 along the nose such that if you glance down with your eyes, you can see outside, see light, and even when you don't, it lets outside light in, so that's poorly designed.4. You need a fairly large open space of floor with absolutely nothing on it or anything next to it, like walls, stuff on counters, shelves, etc. You can play with a smaller space, but you're constantly getting alerted by a big wall of plus signs that you're reaching the edge of your safe space. Now, one thing that's cool is if you leave the space, cross that wall of plus signs, you no longer see the game but get a black and white video feed of what's in front of you, of your surroundings, kinda like looking at your home through a low-res black and white security camera. Now, I do have just barely enough space, but the problem I run into is that you actually need a somewhat larger space since gameplay will often result in your arms that space, so if you've outlined a safe space or play area that's big enough but there's a counter, table, shelf, whatever not in it but right next to it, you will can find your hand knocking into whatever's on that counter, table, shelf, whatever and maybe knocking it off or over or whatever, so it seems like the easy solution for people who don't have big open areas of flat floorspace with nothing surrounding it in their homes would be to play it outside, which brings me to my next point...5. You can't play it outside. Nowhere in any of the instructions does it say you can't use it outside, like it literally won't work outside, so when I tried to use it outside, I thought it had broken. The headset has sensors all over it that must use the walls and ceiling to bounce off of, so when there are no walls or ceiling, it literally freaks out. The controllers work, sort of, but not really. Instead of seeing them in your hands, like you normally can with the headset on, you'll see the controllers 10 or 15 feet away all on top of each other, and you use the menu buttons and fire buttons, but you can't aim, or can only sort of aim because it thinks the hand controllers are 10 or 15 feet away and not positioned like you have them positioned. Now, it seems like with games like Pokemon Go and with so many people not having the rather large amount of space needed to use the Quest 2 that outside wood be a perfect solution, like in a park or in my backyard or in my driveway. When I googled it, I found out that my Quest 2 wasn't broken, but what I was reading was spinning it to be like it didn't work on purpose outside for my safety and not that it's a shortcoming of the Quest 2, which is what it totally is. One interesting thing that I did learn, though, is that the magnifying lenses in the Quest 2 should never be left in direct sunlight, not outside nor inside on a windowsill because if direct sunlight hits it, the sunlight hitting it will be like sunlight hitting a magnifying glass, only it'll focus it on the display screen inside and burn through it lickety-split. So that's A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW THAT'S NEVER MENTIONED IN THE MATERIAL YOU GET WITH THE QUEST 2 WHEN YOU BUY IT.Now that all may make it sound WORSE than it is. Those are my criticisms. Still, it's a pretty dang cool piece of tech, especially for the price. It's just not what I thought it'd be, so I'm going to be giving mine to my nephew.ANOTHER IMPORTANT PIECE OF INFORMATION: 64GB for $100 less vs. 128GB for $100 moreI spent the extra $100 and bought the 128GB one because I didn't want it going obsolete or running short on memory or whatever. If I had it to do all over again, I'd have saved myself the hundred bucks and bought the 64GB one, not because I'm giving it away but because there's no way you'd ever use 64GB, much less 128GB.What the storage is for isn't RAM, so it has no effect on performance, but is strictly for storing games, file storage. Each game, though, is only about 1GB, so before you'd ever use up 64GB, you'd have to have more than 60 apps/games on there. Setting aside that's around $1,800 in apps/games and just a crazy amount in my mind, even if you are that heavy a user and do have that much stuff, it doesn't matter because you can use a USB cable and put games you're not using or don't plan to use on a library that can store them on an app or even through a cell phone app on a cloud, so you'd only ever actually need more than 64GB and so pay the extra $100 for the 128GB version is if you actually want to have access to 60 to 120 games and apps all at the same time without having to swap games/apps out with others in your library. Now, you may be thinking of future-proofing, that there will come a time when the games/apps are 2GB or 3GB or 5GB or whatever and so don't want to be caught short, but you won't be, or you will be, but it won't matter. The reason games/apps are only around 1GB each is going much bigger than that would push or exceed the limits of the Quest 2's processors and internal RAM. That means that when down the road games/apps grow much larger than what they are now, it'll be time to upgrade from the Quest 2 to whatever's next. There's no avoiding that by spending an extra $100 for 128GB of onboard storage instead of 64GB. Now, when the Quest 2 first came out last year, it came out with only 32GB at the same price it is now with 64GB. 32GB wasn't enough storage, so FB/Meta quickly remedied that by making a 64GB for $100 more, but then it obsoleted the 32GB version and dropped the price of the 64GB to the same as what the 32GB one had been. FB/Meta then added the 128GB option because of people demanding it after panicking from the 32GB one not being enough that they thought 64GB wouldn't be either or soon wouldn't be. But it's totally unnecessary and a waste of $100. If you don't believe me, just research it for yourself. EVERYONE says so, and having lived it myself now, I fully agree.SAVE YOURSELF $100 AND BUY THE 64GB QUEST 2......BECAUSE YOU WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY NEVER EVER USE UP EVEN THE 64GB, MUCH LESS EVER NEED 128GB, AND IF YOU SOMEHOW WOULD EVER HAVE MORE THAN 64GB IN APPS/GAMES, YOU CAN SIMPLY STORE EXCESS LESSER USED APPS ON ANOTHER DEVICE/CLOUD THAT YOU CAN REDOWNLOAD THEM FROM SHOULD YOU EVER WANT THEM ONBOARD YOUR QUEST 2 AGAIN LATER, BECAUSE THAT 64GB IS JUST ONBOARD STORAGE CAPACITY, NOT TOTAL STORAGE CAPACITY, WHICH WITH A PC/CLOUD, SKY'S THE LIMIT.

So, I'm new to this VR equipment and I've used this for about 2 months now and I must say I am astonished by how awesome it is. Great amount of content on the oculus store and so much fun for everyone.There are several things I noticed that got a little irritating at first so I am writing this to let others know to save them from the frustration.- If you are new to this type of experience, you will unavoidably feel motion sickness. It was hard for me to get through at first but after a few days or attempts of playing, I adapted to it pretty well to where it does not bother me anymore. Best thing to do is to make sure you have a way to cool yourself down while  you are using it (perhaps a fan) and take frequent breaks.- If you have bangs, be sure to move them out the way of your forehead. It interferes with the sensor. Often the screen would turn black in the middle of gameplay and I would readjust the headset only to realize it was my hair being in the way of the sensor that would cause the screen to go black.- When creating a guardian, I emphasize creating a GOOD play space because there are several times where I have hit something even if wasn't inside the play space. You'll be warned about stepping out of your boundary but not if any object is in the way.-The controllers comes with AA batteries but unfortunately you would have to replace them at some point. There is a rechargeable product that is pretty expensive so my method of recharging the controllers is through the use of rechargeable batteries.-From what I know, you need to play in the light, as there is no way the VR would be able to detect your surrounding if lights were off.There are things I have noticed and I hope to whoever read this find this information useful.

I 10000% Second guessed buying this for my 28 year old boyfriends b day because I seen a lot of reviews that where not the best, I had one family friend get it and very highly recommended it so I did it, Don’t buy this expecting free games on games, This is an amazing experience but one that cost money almost every hood app cost from $10-$50 some games are better than others, they also have workout apps mini gulf shooting and fighting games traveling simulators like endless life and it’s just amazing to have in your living room looking and feeling like your in a whole other world is so crazy ! Please get this I recommend this BIGTIME !

For years I had contemplated a VR headset, but was hesitant.  I had not know anyone else who owned one, so I had no word of mouth to go off of.  I finally bit the bullet and gave this a try.From moment one, I was very impressed with the quality of the device and the VR environment.  Setting up an area was simple, and helped keep me safe. To those who are not aware, the device has you set up a square or circle area to play in.  You set it up with the device, in an area free and clear of obstacles.  Any time you step out of the area, you can literally see through the device into the world outside the VR headset (in black and white), letting you know you are outside the safe zone, and showing you where you are physically so you don't hurt yourself.  I had NO idea that was a feature, and it is truly awesome that this is available as a safety feature.  No walking into walls or into coffee tables!The VR world itself is pretty impressive.  There are a few tutorials you can run through to learn how to operate in the world.  There are ways you can ""Pick up items"" using the controllers, that felt weird at first, but became second nature.  You can even set it up so that you can use your actual hands and fingers to navigate and select items, free from the controllers.There are a few games you can play for free, as well as a few free videos that will take you to places you never thought possible.  Many of the games for purchase are under $30.You can set up your netflix or amazon prime, and watch your favorites in the VR world.On the whole, I am extremely impressed with the Oculus Quest.  I am already planning on purchasing more to give as gifts, so that I can interact with friends and family in the VR world.

Screen just flashes.  Won't work.  Worked for about a month and then just started this weird flashing.  You can't call customer support, you can only email or chat and they don't help.  They keep asking for the same stuff over and over and I keep sending it and getting nowhere.  It's been going on for about two weeks now.  Very expensive piece of junk.

Order a different strap while you're at it. The original is pathetic and uncomfortable. Downloading was slow and updates maddening with our old provider, but most games can be played solo without the connection after download.Otherwise, wow! I even watch Netflix on it while dh is watching sports. There's lots of games and things to do (ping pong, racquet ball type game, boxing, Adventure games...). The best part is playing a game with family who lives 1800 miles away. It's like being in the same room as we laugh, talk, and play.THREE MONTHS LATERI spend WAY too much time on VR. The headset still looks like new, even though I use it daily. I am very careful with it. One evening it wouldn't turn on. Checked original order to look for warranty info (3 months and a few days after purchase) and used the link for ""Included Amazon Support."" Entered phone number, got a call in just a couple minutes. The person was a bit difficult to understand, but for the most part sounded like he was listening rather than just reading/repeating prepared script. I'm guessing there is no specific product knowledge, but after several attempts to revive unit (black screen) a return was arranged and a new headset is due to arrive in 4 days. I will check new box for warranty info. to be sure the next one doesn't wait until expired. If I have any issues downloading all the purchased apps, I'll append this review.Yes there are ways the headset could have been better. It is front heavy and it's difficult to imagine they couldn't do better, but that's probably part of planned obsolescence. The original set up did not flow intuitively, and ultimately did not get the referral credit. I don't like having fb linked, but use the various settings so it isn't telling everyone when I'm playing nor reporting to my wall. I don't like having limited sources for purchasing games, but plenty of folks seem to think that's ok with apple. With all it's shortcomings, I still highly recommend this. I've never been ""a gamer"" so perhaps my expectations are different from those that find this system intolerable. But I've ""met"" some great folks on line (some not so great too), had fun with family, and really enjoy the system.

I picked this up for my teenage son as a Christmas present. I was a bit concerned about the internet connection, since we live very rural and have only a very, very slow connection. But this works without a problem.The headset is, thanks to the straps, adjustable to a wide range of head sizes. It doesn't pinch the hair or rub or feel uncomfortable. The viewer fits around my younger daughter's head all the way up to my husband's very large one. There is a built-in cushion around the area it rests on the face, which keeps it from rubbing or irritating. The nose area, unfortunately, isn't nearly as 'all fitting' and is rather large. My son does find it sometimes distracting, since he can glimpse a tiny bit of the 'real' world when glancing down. There is also an extra accessories which is placed in the headset for those who wear glasses. I've tried it with and without this extra piece, but didn't have trouble with my glasses either way. The handheld controllers are comfortable in the hand, have buttons which are easy to reach, and work very well. These do have wrist straps, which work very well, too.On to the games and usage! I'm not tech-savvy, so things have to be pretty basic for me to use them. This headset is no problem. It came mostly charged and ready to go. It's pretty self-explanatory with the menus easy to see and use when the visor is on. It took about 2 hours for the installation to download and install...but that's thanks to our very, very, very slow connection. And we found that fast (so that tells you how quick it'd be on 'normal' connections). It took a bit to flip through all of the menu options and included apps to see what is there and what not. We did need to download the games, but this was no problem. There are free ones and variously priced ones, giving something for every direction and budget. Once downloaded, the games work easily with or without internet connection (depending on the game, I assume). We got the basic memory one and it has more than enough space for us.The headset battery usage lasts about 2 to 4 hours, but this depends on what games are being played as well as the screen brightness and such. So, it can vary. The hand controllers, of course, hold longer, but believe it or not, these are NOT rechargeable. They use standard AA.Clear some room space when using this. It does have an awesome mapping out application, which the kids loved to use and roam through the house with. And the games to have the player 'draw' the borders first. Watch flailing arms, though (we did have some accidental whacking of innocent family members going on). It is fun. Tons of fun. Some of my relatives, who tried it out for a few minutes because...who wouldn't?...did experience a bit of a headache after 5 or so minutes of play or had a bit of dizziness. I didn't have a problem nor do my kids, though.I'm glad we picked this up, one for both of my kids at home, and they do play together (they can chat through the headsets and such as well). Oh, and my son has streamed Netflix through it and said that it's an odd experience as well.

Great standalone set.  The older models 64 GB was a bit too small in storage.  This 128 GB is plenty of room to house a good number of games.  I currently have 75 GB free of 128, and have RE4, Saints and Sinners, Climb 2, Thrill of the Fight, All three Vaders, Wander, Brink, VR Fishing, and golf+ loaded.The Quest does take some getting used to.  I got nauseous the first time I used it for any length of time.  But eventually you get used to it.  Everything works as intended.  And the controllers are pretty accurate and responsive.  Headset isn't heavy to be uncomfortable.  But thank goodness the battery only lasts an hour or two, or you could be down the rabbit hole for a while and not even know it.Quest store though has a lot to be desired.  You really have to research games on your own.  Very few have trial versions where you can try a small portion to see if you like it.  The search for games is really basic in the store.  It seems they will really push certain games.  And it gets hard to navigate.  Really, in the store, you either know what you want and can search it, or good luck finding anything.  Unfortunately, this means you have to rely on third party review sites.  Which means they are recommending what they like, not what you may be looking for.  This really puts smaller and niche games at a disadvantage, as most of these review sites look at the same best games.Also the desktop program store and the store on the quest are the same, but different.  You have to watch out what you are buying, and make sure it's for the right product.  You can go to the Oculus store, and have only the Quest 2 as your device, and they will still bring up products for the Rift and Quest.  And if you accidentally buy them, you are SOL.  So it's best just to stick to the store on the Quest 2.  And as I said before, the Quest 2 has very few trials.  Most everything is buy to play.  And once you buy, there are no returns.The big plus for the desktop though is that if your PC can handle it.  For lack of a better term, you can stream a game onto your quest from the PC.  Controllers won't work, and you have to use the keyboard on most.  But I hear it transforms some desktop games.  And with recent updates, you can do it without tethering.Overall, despite a lot of quirks and issues.  It's been worth it.  VR still isn't where it should be.  But the Quest 2 is a big step in the right direction, in both affordability and what it gives you.

Pros:Cool new experience of the next big thing. It's exciting to just be apart of it.Speakers are amazing and you do not need headphones. I would like to see an add on subwoofer though in the future.Great entry price to get into this new universe.Cons:Headset is way too big, it's front heavy, the straps aren't comfortable. The size and weight needs to be majorly reduced. It's the same exact size as my first unit 7 years ago.Not many games, apps, and experiencesNo playable demos to try it before you buy it.No haptic feedback in the goggles.Image quality is the same as my unit 7 years ago, can still see pixelization in details, not crisp enough.Most apps have cartoonist graphics.  If you want xbox/Playstation VR you're only going to get super NES Mario Brothers VR for most all apps and games.  Haven't see. Unreal engine type graphics anywhere.Battery life is 1.5 hours which isn't very good.Nearly everything costs money. In the first 2 days I spent $150 on games and apps.  Good games are $40.Can't use Bluetooth headphones or surround speakers as the latency is too slow.No Color passthrough video, it's grainy black and white video.IOI opps I mean Facebook forces you to have a fb account and controls everything here. It's fine because it makes integration seemless, but I still don't like that you can't opt out even if you wanted to.Conclusion:There are any improvements that are needed but I still would recommend getting this.  Oculus pro cones out in May and Oculus 3 comes out in 2023. So if you are reading this before August 2022 than get this unit, if after that then wait for the next generation. It will be lighter and smaller for sure. In the future we'll look back at the quest 1 like how we look back at blackberry phones.

I was pretty excited to get the OQ2 after hearing about it.  I had high hopes of losing myself in the metaverse and immersing myself in other worlds.  Kind of hard to do when you're constantly annoyed because everything is out of focus.  I've tried with glasses, without glasses.  I've tried adjusting for IPD, pupillary distance (how far apart your eyes are) but with only 3 settings I can't get it right for me.  I constantly have to adjust the goggles on my face to get even just the center in focus.  The graphics are weak in most games, in fact most of the games feel and look like Wii games from almost 20 years ago.  Watching even the highest resolution videos are a disappointment too.  Very grainy and pixelated.I'm returning this.  Total disappointment.

A Fantastic idea to purchase for a early Christmas gift to my lady an myself. This is by far my favorite purchase of 2021 and play almost more then my PS5. Amazing games, some are a Lil off the wall but fun and affordable! I even bought some games and was able to return them full return back to my card. You will need to upgrade some parts to help with the experience but Amazon got tons of accessories for the oculus quest 2. Did get the 3 year warranty and we have kids so we supervise when using.

So, there are two sides to this product. From a hardware standpoint, I really don't have any complaints. The headset is comfortable enough with one of the better adjustable head straps I've ever seen on any head-worn device. (I recommend wearing a cloth skullcap or even washcloth so that the strap isn't pulling on your hair (a baseball cap won't work), and the towel will collect sweat, although I've yet to sweat in it. There's a learning curve with the controllers, though it's not bad. Be careful, you could easily break them quickly, smashing them into each other, or punching into a wall or objects, though the guardian carrier does work effectively in keeping you from running into things once you set it up, so make sure you set it up properly. This product can NOT be operated in less than an 8ft square space. You may want to own a house with a dedicated room, or have some space in your apt. Don't expect to use this in an apt with no central open space. The audio isn't as good as some newer iphones, but its not bad either, however, I hope sending it out to a stereo is seamless. I have a feeling it won't be. Connecting to the internet was not a problem at all.My real issue is I don't feel the browsing of apps and functions is OPTIMAL considering how much fanfare Facebook is blowing about the metaverse. The nav took me a bit to get used to, but then it became fairly logical. The issue is some apps are much better at navigating than others. Having to boot out with the Oculus button varies app to app, and it almost never takes you back to the previous menu which you dove in from. The control console always shows up, but the menu of what you were in doesn't always. Case in point - the tv channel, which includes various travel VR scenes of Paris, Cairo etc. The Paris footage was great, if short, but I tried to boot out of Cairo, and the TV icon became visible, and I clicked on it, and I went right back into the video where I was, NOT to the previous menu of selections. I NEVER got back there, and ended up NOWHERE near where I started. Facebook needs to crack down on those apps not meeting the nav standards, but they prob don't want to lose previous content, which takes some effort to create, it is clear.You have to give this time. Some apps will disappoint, others will amaze, and there's no way to predict it, because this is a new sort of medium. The demos are often not adequate to be sure you want to pay for the app, and that can be a bummer, because if you don't like it, you just paid for zippo.For instance, one app claimed to be free, then dumped me into a big showroom where you have to buy your weapons. Other apps have demos good enough to make it clear buying the app will be worth it over time. Facebook should do more to demand adequate demos from developers.An app like Superhot is phenomenal and makes you happy you bought this. The demo gives you a taste of what the game about, and then the game seems like a good deal, and you've got a satisfying experience.  I HIGHLY recommend the ISS space experience downloads if you want to see what floating in orbit is like. It's quite astonishing. The travel experiences make you want to go to those places. The issue is if you don't get into the right apps, you might find yourself saying ho hum.The travel TV segments look great if a bit dated. The famous fitness program Supernatural instantly put me into a 14-day trial that will go straight into monthly payments if I don't cancel it. Can't you just show me the program for an hour without getting my payment info? This isn't your iphone where you know iOS is there to protect you. This is Facebook, and yeah, I have a bias towards Apple, and I'm here to tell them that this market is open to take away from Facebook, because they aren't doing it 100% optimally.Another problem I have is the utility VR programs that tap into desktop software I want to use that are more specialized work through Steam and the PC. I want the Quest 2 to interface with Apple, and that may not be happening.I'm not saying that VR isn't a stunning experience, and the physical side is really well figured out. It truly is, but the software side (as often is the case) could be tighter. This is Facebook, and they claim to own this space so they deserve more pointed criticism. The issue is also that VR is a somewhat new medium, so some patience is to be expected. It will take a few tries to get used to the basic operation, and then you can start assessing the apps. However, if you get dud apps before you get used to the operation, you may find it all overrated. I just think Facebook should match their introduction to the physical use of the headset to a good cross section of apps to bring you in further. Echo VR is another app that shows you the potential of the medium once you get into it. However, I'm not really about meeting up with people I don't know to play games. These apps should have single-player options by default. The VR environment instantly puts you into a space where you're making choices, and sometimes you don't like the choices the app you're in has made. You want to do something else.People complain about the interface of the accounts with Facebook. I wasn't crazy about it at first, but you can create multiple profiles under the main one, so it's not the end of the world. Of course, many of the settings have to be reentered from scratch, and so far the apps don't seem to cross across the accounts, so not sure if that's optimal.Also, literally ZERO apps come with the console. There are free apps, but you wouldn't know it, since how to find them is NOT immediately apparent (once again, squeezing your own customer instead of being their pal), some of which are more or less lying, and others which are highly boring. You would think Facebook would have the brains to greet new users into their wondrous world by just having a mainstay of 3 seamless good apps for everyone that got you feeling good about the console you just bought.So I give it 4 stars for setup of the headset itself, and 2 stars for not really introducing the user properly to a set of apps that shows them the power of the medium overall.

Once we purchased the virtual gaming console my son was eager to add games to his account.  Well thats when everything went bad.We purchased gift cards to use for this purpose and as soon as he entered the card numbers the funds were used before he could click to purchase the games.  He had been robbed online!  Someone in AZ stole his gift cards!This happened not once, but twice.I contacted Oculus support online and after 3-days of sending them details, screenshots of the account, etc.  they told us to contact the bank. They did nothing!We lost $75 on their unsecured web site via the app.  They suck!Now, my 12 year son is so disappointed.

Maybe I got a defective HP headset but I had to constantly make micro adjustments and the eye's had to be lined up perfectly to not get a fuzzy image. Event then most of the surrounding lens was putting out fuzzy images. I would get stuck in VR Mode on my Desktop and after force closing anything related too VR It would still be there.I would have to force log to get control of my mouse back because the Hotkey would not work anymore after getting stuck like that. VR Editing mode didn't work at all in the Unreal Engine (I'm a developer), I would be far too high up and my controllers wouldn't work.I had nothing but trouble with that headset all around it was horrible.I decided to buy an Oculus Quest 2 and I absolutely do not like the fact that you 'Have to pair it with your phone'. I really dislike the fact that you absolutely have to log in to Facebook on your phone and pair it in order to use the headset. If it weren't for that I would give 5 stars. The instant I put it on Everything was crystal clear unlike the over priced bulky/heavy HP headset I had.I didn't have to adjust the lenses and I was surprised that people would say text is easier to read on the HP then the Quest because that doesn't seem to be the case in fact with the HP headset I had to be looking directly at something or it would be very fuzzy and out of focus and the Quest doesn't have that issue at all...it could be to the side and still come in clear.

I began my VR journey 2 months ago. I did some research prior to purchasing of different VR headsets, and the Oculous Quest 2 seemed liked the logical winner. The price for refresh rates offered and the visual quality was a no brainer; I thought. Never-mind that Facebook is attached to it. So for one month I have had in my possession the Quest 2.I will outline my experience here as a PC Gamer, and I'll try to keep it brief. What it's going to come down to is the duration at which you game. I haven't tried VR in any AAA titles, first person shooters. My primary reason for entering VR was for the flight simulator DCS World, which does support VR, but is not really graphically optimized for either AMD nor Nvidia.I started with a 5700 XT graphics card - which you can have an OK VR experience with. Enters the cable issue. Now, there are a very limited number of cables manufactured that can meet the data requirements for the Quest 2, IF you choose not to buy Oculous's OFFICIAL $expensive cable. I tried a few - get the official cable. And I might note; you do want the official cable. Skip the thought you are going to have an amazing PC gaming experience over WiFi data.Problem 2: Powering the headset while gaming. Now that you have the official cable AND even though you have USB 3.1/Gen 1 or 2 TYPE A - You need a USB adapter for type C. There are only a couple produced that actually provide enough data throughput to have an OK VR experience.The duration: It really depends on how long you play. For an online flight sim where missions take hours for one mission - the battery dies. Then you have to disconnect from the online server, switch back to your monitor; it becomes a whole ordeal.The solution: A USB type C PCIe 3.0 x 16 adapter card. And there are only a few manufactured that can actually provide enough power to charge the Quest 2 as you game. StarTech is one of them sold here at amazon to save you some trouble. Now, comes the other problem. Do you have enough room with your graphics card air cooler to use your other PCIe x16 (whatever gen) slot? Fortunately I did, so I got the adapter card.This part has nothing to do with the Quest 2 itself...You are enjoying your VR experience so you lay down a chunk of change to amplify that with a new modern graphics card like a 3080. If you don't put a water block on it - you lose your ability to use your PCIe 16x adapter. Why? Because the air coolers are 2.5 to 2.7 card slot widths to cool it. So you buy a riser cable to use the adapter...see where I'm going with this?So, back to the original problem - providing power to the headset so it's actually useful. The crux is the battery. Over time it's not going to hold a charge and your ability to game in VR is going to be less and less. - unless that adapter card or your motherboard can actually power the headset. My motherboard isn't too ancient (z370).So you spent $ for whatever it costs now - for a price/pixel ratio that is great, but is actually hot garbage in terms of functionality. Power.  Then you spend more money $$$ on trying to provide a solution to the power problem. The visual clarity is good for VR. You can read text, make out dials etc. In the end it's meaningless.My final conclusion is what myself and other PC gamers should of done instead of trying to find a solution to Oculous's problem is save and buy a proper PC gaming VR headset.The End - Other specific functionality regarding the headset below.Tracking: For whatever reason it will lose tracking no matter if my room is lit or not.Data throughput: Using my USB 3.1 Type A connections with a usb to c adapter works ok and it does achieve the data throughput required for VR - the Quest 2 doesn't like it at all. I have experienced graphics deterioration and strange blinking during head turning movement. This is to the point of having to exit the game and restart the game itself or restart the Quest 2. This is using a GeForce 3080. The only good experience I have had graphically is using a Type C adapter card and the only slot that can provide ample throughput is perhaps a PCIe 3.0 16x slot.Controllers: ""Where is the second controller - you must have it!"" For the majority of VR things I use only one controller, including gaming. My primary game controllers are an xbox style controller for PC and HOTAS for flight sims. Quest 2 will be like ""But where are MY controllers? They all must be active!"" You will receive controller notifications and sometimes while watching a movie you will have your controller your NOT using pop up in the middle of the movie screen.The guardian: Quest 2, ""Set your guardian! No, really set it again...hey can you set that guardian up!?"" The guardian is your virtual to real world play area. I primarily use stationary. You will set it, then you will have to set it again and again.My final overall thoughts for the Quest 2 is that it's a toy. It's an entry into the VR arena. The software platform and overall experience is perhaps built for the general masses to experience VR. Your VR experience will be of quality, but with limited time.* Other problems- Since switching to the USB port on my motherboard after an hour or so of play the bottom half of the video (gaming) pixelates and corrupts. I have not found a solution to this.I have found an active usb cable with an external power source can keep the quest 2 charged while playing.

I really wanted to love this since my boyfriend has an occulus and loves it. For starters, the fit is not ideal. I found that it was blurry and really wasn’t clear regardless of where I positioned the headset or how I moved the lenses. Then I could still see through the nose to the floor because it’s so much larger than my face. On top of that, it was so heavy it just made the entire experience uncomfortable and not enjoyable. I gave two stars because I see a lot of promise with VR; just not this early in the game.

Update: Facebook did refund my bundle purchased in error. They also have been very good at keeping in touch via email. It was still frustrating, but i do love VR.I received this as a birthday present. I have really enjoyed using it. However, when I tried to use it the second day, I was shown a screen that wanted me to log in. When I tried, it came up with an old email address which I don’t have access to anymore. It would not let me change the email address. It also allows one to login using Facebook However it would not accept my password. After conversations with three ‘support agents’, I gave up. Then, quite by accident, I discovered I could login using the iPad app. I had asked it I could use it to log in, but was ignored. Then, being an inexperienced user, I ordered a bundle of games. When I installed  the first of 3 I discovered that it needed me to be able to move around. So, since I had seen Oculus had a good refund policy, I tried to get a refund. The website denied my refund and said I could chat with an agent. When I got the agent online, he told me that they don’t refund bundles. I explained I was handicapped and confined to a chair. He said”most people research before buying”. That was not a very friendly response. My advice is to be aware that you are on your own. I’m 77 years old. One would think I would know better then to trust “Meta”, which now owns Oculus.

After putting in some time to read reviews on some top tech sites about the best VR headset to purchase, I made this purchase pretty enthusiastically. Fast-forward two days and I just as enthusiastically returned it.The graphics feel straight out of the Nintendo Wii era. The top-rated games are pixelated and give no sense of immersion. There's stuttering in the menu animations. The whole thing feels like the headset's hardware is struggling to run graphics from years ago. It feels buggy and incomplete and very dated.That being said, the controls are great and there are some really cool features that would make this an amazing unit if the hardware was amped up a bit. I love the ability to draw the boundaries of your playing area, and the ""guardian"" wall it projects to keep you safe while playing. I still can't figure out how it remembered the boundaries of my playing area in my living room after I turned the headset off and took it to another room before bringing it back.

EDIT #1- The first purchase was replaced in record time by Amazon... due to power failures.Our ""NEW"" unit performs as intended so far. As fads go, it will cost you considerably to operate.Valentines Day gift idea, for our ""Straight A"" student.. but Just another major distraction... at a high cost factor. New tech fad that will fade away like the rest.  Be prepared to buy the costly accessories that will enable your VR to operate efficiently.Biggest complaint so far,.. the Battery Life... / power failures.and for starters, have a major credit card ready to set up an account... on scam masters F'book or Twitt'r...  Just another GAME format to keep the young at heart spending time away from reality... while keeping money flying from pockets.If you MUST have one, Amazon prices are in line with the rest and you can return if faster if it fails right out of the box... since they have a know fail rate.after a week.... the battery is a BIG issue for us,... we've tried a back-up battery... and that does it's job but will not help matters..And so, It is going back to Amazon ASAP...What'A Let'Down....

So, lets get right to it. The battery life on these vr headsets don't last very long. Maybe, just maybe an hour of playtime before your battery is low and you have to charge it. And that depends on what you are playing or doing with the headset. I understand they are headsets, not meant to last long but, it be nice if they at least last 2 hours at most. Then I would mind the whole take of and recharge them.Onto the heat issue. These things get do get a little warm after a while. And they can get hot if you are playing a very active game where you are moving a lot. Would've been nice to have some sort of better cushions for where the headset meets your head at. Because the cushion/spacers that come with the headset are not good at all. Don't get me wrong they are semi comfortable, I will give them that but, besides the semi comfort part, they don't help with keeping your face cool. Might have to look into aftermarket cushions for that area. Maybe some cushions that have a cool gel inside of them. Maybe that'll work, maybe.Overall though, I am happy with my purchase as VR is getting more and more popular now an days. Oh, the price also for these are good especially since you have some high ends headsets out there that have the same components and visuals and such.Recommend getting this headset if your looking to start getting into VR. Unless you save up for a more pricier and high end VR headset.

I started my journey into VR with an Oculus Rift S, that had many issues, mostly with my cord, that costs more than half the price of the headset to replace since FB stopped supporting the Rift S. When I bought this unit I was, for legitimate reasons, worried I might experience some issues. I did not. The Quest 2 runs PCVR better than my Rift S did, and it can also run games on it's own without my PC. As I do have a PC I opted for the lower gb version, since every game I own is off of steam for the most part. I will say that the stock strapping this comes with is some sort of miracle of modern science, the fact that it holds so tight with such a basic snap-on connection is crazy, but that strap is garbage. I'd recommend buying an upgraded halo for the Quest 2 immediately.

I love this headset. I purchased it specifically to use Supernatural, and it's totally worth, even it if that's all you do with it. I'm finding other apps that I enjoy also. Initially I had a problem with the guardian tracking; however, after an update, it seems to have mostly corrected itself. The ""mostly"" is why I'm only giving it 4 stars instead of 5. To be fair, I contacted Oculus support directly and they were very helpful and responsive and were going to allow me to send it back. There's a lot of reasons to me why that was a little scary and very inconvenient, but mostly because I'm paying for some subscriptions and the fear of how long it would take to get a replacement. I tested it out for a while before thinking I would send it back, but it has kept working. So, I'm keeping it. Hoping it doesn't die, now that I've missed my return window, but so far so good and it's absolutely worth it. Especially if you're like me and sit at a desk ALL day and want to exercise without anyone seeing you (or leaving your house).

**UPDATE** I requested a new one on Jan 18th, finally received the replacement on Jan 26th.It would have been much easier and faster to have originally purchased from the Oculus store.As of right now: delivered this morning 730 unboxed and charged, 10am first start: controllers would not track properly.  Set up through oculus app then it updated and restarted. Immediately after restart the screen tracking was all over the place rendering it useless.  After an hour in a chat window with oculus support we determined it was DOA. Replacement ordered now to wait 10-11 days for the ""prime shipping"" to get it here. Bonus though, if the new one works i got 15 bucks from oculus for my troubles and btw they offered a replacement too.

I've always wanted to try VR and finally sprung for the Quest 2. What is bad is that you need to use a Facebook account to set it up. There are a lot of games for the Q2 that range from free to fifty bucks. There are some free apps that are not interactive but very interesting, like a tour of the White House and a tour of the International Space Station in 360°. Or get a close up look at dinosaurs. Several free games are available, as well. My wife likes to fish with Bait. You may want to opt for an upgraded head strap as the included strap can be a little difficult to adjust, especially if you share the headset with another person.My wife says the screen is very sharp, but I've never been able to get it more than moderately sharp. My glasses do not fit well in the headset. The headset is kind of heavy. I wish I could compare this with the PlayStation VR. You may want to borrow your friend's Quest 2 if you get motion sickness easily to see if VR is for you.

A truly mesmerizing thing to behold. So much functionality and content in such a little thing, one look at the quest 2 and you’re itching your brain at how so much fits into there. To hold out your arm in a virtual world and see your arm stretch out digitally is unreal! Playing with a friend just adds icing to the cake for me, and even playing social games is quite entertaining. With the ability to watch movies, in a large virtual movie theater like you’re at a real cinema will never make you go to a theater again. Exercise, watch videos or movies, play terrifying or hilariously fun games, it’s all in the palm of your hands. You can even go somewhere far away, my choice was going to see the northern lights. Although for play it’s also a tool for work if need be, as there are free apps to download that can help your work life in any way. There are so many other functions I couldn’t possibly fit in this review. However I will add this: I received my headset and had faulty lenses that were blurry as hell, and had a replacement come that gave me the experience I paid for. Keep in mind that statement as it can happen to you as well, my replacement took about a week I believe and even came earlier than the tracker said.If you’re thinking about it..get it, trust me you’ll have a smile glued to your face the first second you see your virtual reality hands.

The headset itself is not bad.  As other reviews have stated, you'll almost certainly want to get an upgraded strap and maybe a battery pack.  If you wear glassed you'll need to buy lens protectors since for some reason the Quest 2 (unlike previous models), does not include them.The REAL negatives are Facebook related.  I have an FB account but I am not a big FB user.  I managed to have some fun for about two hours, after which the account link cause a verification lock on my Facebook profile.  Since Oculus forces account integration, losing access to FB means losing access to Oculus, purchases, settings, account, etc..  And since there is no Facebook support in existence anymore, not even Oculus support will do a damn thing to help you (I was told that even though they are both Meta, they apparently have no communication with each other).And so now I need to refute all my Oculus purchases via my credit card.  Rather than starting everything from scratch, I'm returning this dud until I find a better, non Meta, option.

I understand that this may just be my individual experience with my individual headset- but from day one, all I experienced with this thing was frustration. Firstly- they fail to tell you that you can’t use Oculus Link to play through your PC unless you have one of a very specific list of supported graphics cards, which is the main thing that I bought it for. I decided I could get over that and just use it as a standalone unit- then I noticed this strange green streak on the left lens. At first I thought it was a graphics error, but it persisted after several attempts to troubleshoot with Oculus support and to clean the lens. I received a partial refund for the defect from Amazon, and again decided that I could settle. About two weeks into my usage of the product, it would load into the blue “M” screen- then get stuck on the “…” screen while it played the main menu music and made sounds as I pointed the controllers around. The display was clearly stuck for some reason. I factory reset the device several times to try and fix this issue but it stayed on the “…” screen. At this point I threw my hands up and returned it all together. Extremely underwhelming and frustrating experience- it really felt like I was beta-testing an unfinished product that I payed full price for.

I bought this a few months ago and I can’t imagine going back to anything other than VR. That being said, this definitely needs a battery pack b/c it burns through charge. You get 2 hours max of play time regardless of what you’re doing. I bought the elite strap battery pack and that gives 2 hours exactly extra totaling a max of 4 hours. I think I’d prefer my own battery pack in hindsight to get more time but it’s easy to spend too much time playing. The second issue is memory. This works great for starters but it’s surprisingly easy to use everything. I have uninstalled games I already played so that I can play others. Unfortunately you can’t up the memory so you have to buy a whole different headset to bump up. Thirdly, I suggest using an anti-microbial spray for the foam face padding like the cpap cleaner sprays. It’s easy to sweat in these and the silicone makes horrible marks on my skin so cleaning it is best to stop break outs. But if you worry about breakdown then silicone covers are great.

The experience of a VR headset itself is great! I love what is capable of and using it, I have a pretty small player space but even so, I have been able to enjoy various games with the Quest 2 and the link cable.ABOUT JOYSTICK DRIFT:I am deeply concerned about the durability of the analog joysticks on the controllers, I have used this product for less than 20 DAYS, most of my playtime is Beat Saber (which does not even use the analog stick) and then around 10 to 15 combined hours of Pavlov and HL Alyx.It was while playing HL Alyx that I started noticing that sometimes my character was sometimes randomly moving to the right when I pushed the stick forward, initially I thought it was due to a faulty link connection, but I checked in the software calibration the joysticks, and surprise surprise: Joystick drift on the left controller. But not any kind of drift, it pulls hard to the right whenever I push left, so it's IMPOSSIBLE to go left on continuous movement games, and it sometimes pulls right when I am moving forward. This type of stick drift will NOT be diminished by software calibration sadly.I could claim the warranty right now, but apparently I have to ship the ENTIRE Oculus back and Amazon won't pay shipping fees because I have shipped the product outside the US. Meaning that it's probably cheaper (in time and money) to buy an entirely NEW left controller for $69 from the Oculus store and get it shipped than paying shipping fees, being out of an Oculus for god knows how long (According to other users they take somewhere between 2 and 8 WEEKS or longer to get the product back), set it all up once again, and all of that hassle just to most likely, as said by other Oculus owners, get a REFURBISHED controller back.I feel SCAMMED regarding this, but your mileage may vary as I have seen other users with controllers lasting for about 1.5 to 2 years without developing issues, seems like I just got a DEFECTIVE PRODUCT, one that apparently I just have to deal with now. The only reason I would give 2 stars is that, even if I got a defective controller, the experience has been amazing, which kind of saddens me and makes me give it 1 star because I really looked forward to using my headset more often, which will now be an awful experience thanks to the stick drift.

Got a humble bundle with a few VR games and this seemed to be a popular headset. So far I'm not overly impressed with the setup but will try it. I have the games in steam and don't want to spend $30 to have virtual desktop. That being said Airlink has been a challenge to set up so far and I feel for anyone who is non technical trying to set this up to work with steam. Will update my review once/if I get it working.I managed to kind of get it working sometimes but you have to uninstall and re-install the PC Quest app in order to get the device to pair with AirLink. Seems like I can't just put the headset on and play, I have to spend an hour removing and re-adding the device, removing and re-adding the software, rebooting systems that are completely fine otherwise. Even the hardwire I tried tonight did not work as expected. Seriously considering returning the unit. The only reason I run out of battery so far is spending an hour removing and putting it back on trying to get it to talk to the PC in any way.

I had the Quest 1 for a year before buying this one. While the display itself is a bit lower quality (read about that online) the extra rendering quality makes the overall experience superior. I see things in Onward that I did not see in the Quest 1.The lighter weight is a plus. The new hand controls have a different feel; I think they are not as comfortable as the Quest 1 controllers. I've gotten used to them now.One downside is that the power cord is only a foot long. If I want to play when the battery is running out I can't do it. So, if you have a Quest 1, save that long cord and when you pass on your Quest 1 to someone else, give them the shorter cord.

I’ve always wanted VR tech but was always held back with reports of problems with the tech and cost barrier with having to own an expensive gaming PC. I am happy to say that the Quest 2 is the first mainstream and modern VR that is an all in one standalone.I am very impressed with it. From all the features it has including the high resolution screens, comfort, and speakers. The software was much more advanced than expected. I feel like there is so much potential for this tech. Once people try it out they will want to have it. It has many applications for entertainment and real world. I think Oculus is the only main competitor right now and is doing a great job so far. I am curious to see what Apple will bring, but they will have to work very very hard to surpass this. I think it does benefit from the open software with Android. That is a few years from now but will enjoy the Oculus until something better comes along. In the future, I’d like even high res screens, more apps available (which I think will come soon considering the recent explosion in popularity), and increased comfort and usability. It will definitely get better and am excited for the future and possibilities of it. I’d highly recommend the product. Feels like when I got my first Xbox.

I think for the cost, this is the best option out there. It's not super sharp, and I definitely recommend a third-party head strap attachment for comfort and clarity. I think this would be 5 stars if they included a padded head-strap and a little better resolution. Audio is pretty good. Games are fun, although really not plentiful. I love all the cool VR videos and apps that have been created, but there's not a whole lot going on yet.I think the most disappointing feature is that it's not easy to interface with Steam.

I was really looking forward to using the Oculus.  It set up with no problem and connected to WiFi and I thought they were pretty cool.My issue is that even with the glasses insert in, my glasses scratched the Oculus lenses and this was only after my first time using them, probably 1/2 hour max.  Fortunately, my regular prescription glasses were not scratched.Now, they do have third-party options like buying spacers for the lenses to prevent the lenses from being scratched by glasses and you can pay to have prescription lenses made.  However, I planned on using this with my wife who also wears glasses so prescription lenses aren't that great of an option.However, I was so turned off by this that after consulting with my wife, I decided to return them.My recommendation for anyone who wears glasses is to buy the spacers first to prevent any damage and then if desired, go the prescription route.

We've had an Oculus Quest for going on two years now, so I was super excited to upgrade to the new one and see how much better it was. I have to tell you...the original while heavier and hotter had a way better strap system to keep it on your head. Every time I'd go to use the Quest 2 I'd end up with a headache or my face would hurt. Trying to keep it from slipping off your face means making those fabric straps super tight, which just makes your head hurt. I finally ended up buying an elite strap (not the offical Oculus one, but a nicely padded one that hopefully won't break) just so that I could use my Quest 2 comfortably. The charging cord that's included is also super short as compared to the original Quest, no doubt so that you have to buy a longer one and spend more money. In all, while there were some improvements made from the original, they also changed things for the 2nd that made it so that you have to spend more on accessories just to be able to use it.

I was provided with access to this Oculus Quest 2 VR by my son. He assumed I wouldn’t like it because it is VR and therefore scary. Couldn’t have been more wrong.

The field-of-view on the Oculus Quest 2 is too narrow compared to something like the Valve Index. With the Oculus 89 degrees, you feel like you have a TV on your nose versus the true immersion you get from the valve Index with its 130 degrees. I really think the Oculus does a disservice to the VR community at large because the experience (even with current technology) can be so much better than what this product delivers.I can definitely appreciate Facebook's efforts at making a simple, easy-to-use, all-in-one product that just works out of the box. This probably makes it a good product as a general purpose novelty for use with family or friends over the holidays or something. If you actually care about VR technology and don't mind taking the time to configure a few things, the valve index will offer you a superior experience. It's not even close unfortunately.Returned.

After purchasing the Oculus Quest 2, I sold my Xbox the next week. This takes gaming to a whole new level that ""flat sceen"" gaming can't create.It's mind blowing how immersive and fun this product is. Being able to play anywhere without cords is the future of VR and Oculus 2 does this right.There are a lot of fun games, Eleven Table Tennis, Onward (an FPS Shooter), mini golf, and loads more depending on what you are looking for.You have to experience this new level of gaming trust me. It's great.

Oculus was the company that brought us VR. They pushed hard via donations to make it a reality. They ended up bringing one of the biggest gaming minds to the mix John Carmack. Then all of a sudden facebook bought them out and all of their promises turned into lies. Like exclusive games not being a thing. Lie after lie after lie and the end result is the quest with its name changed to Meta. Basically throwing Oculus under a bus. Its hard to be happy, positive or even like this whole transition. It leaves a bad taste in everyones mouth that was involved and sadly seeing Oculus just turn into nothing is heart breaking.Glad others have picked up on the VR market because the Quest is not the way to go. I gave it 3 stars because its affordable but other than that just bad market all over it.

i'm sure the games are great also, but just started it up and was on my prime video content quick. Star trek is AMAZING to watch. I can't wait to try more video content on it. I would suggest it for anyone that is interested in being able to sit in a chair or walk around inside with it. But make sure you have someone close by if you are using it for games so you dont run into walls.

Had this for about 2 months before the left controller just died completely. I sent it to Oculus for RMA. That was over a month ago. They said they'd send a new controller on December 28th, but that never happened. They DO NOT have phone support. Everything is through chat only and they always give you the same response to any inquiries on the ticket. They're ""escalating it to the Logistics team"". I've never experienced customer support this bad before. If you're going to buy this, DO NOT send anything to them for RMA. You'll never get it back. Find another way to get the issue fixed.

I love playing my games on my laptop.  Should say ""loved"".  I like ""escape room"" type games that make you use logic and reasoning to figure out solutions to puzzles, locks, etc.  I had no idea what I was getting into when I first put this thing on.  Just plain WOW.  I'm now IN the game and it's an amazing experience.  I haven't had this much fun in a while.  Would HIGHLY recommend, although I guess you have to love gaming to begin with but if you do......Cons:  You have to have a Facebook account to use.  I've heard they may change that to just being required to have an Oculus account.  Not yet though.  The headset is a little bulky.  I'm going to try a upgraded head strap to see if that helps.  Some games will take a little getting used to as far as motion sickness goes.  If you are into logic with adventure, I can't say enough about The Room and Red Matter.  If I never buy another game again, I would say the experience of playing these two games was worth every penny for the purchase of the Quest 2.

I have downloaded over 10 games, and I still have room on my Oculus.  If you run out of space, you can just uninstall old games you are not playing.  The VR experience has been fun.  And most of all I like giving my guests the VR experience.  Oculus has a pretty good support team, you can chat with online that will help you though anything you might have question.

Had for a couple days now and playing  some of the games is so immersive you can easily lose yourself in them. The biggest con of this is the original head straps are no way meant for a long duration and I would even say short duration. I admittedly have a huge head but even my 13 year old brother could only play play for a short time as the original straps w/ oculus feel like they are sucking your eyeballs out. You will have facial pain for sometime after playing.  Everyone's head shape is not the same and I don't think they truly factored that in when developing straps.  Would HIGHLY recommend buying on brand or off brand elite / comfort strap when purchasing this.

Amazing!  This is the next level.  This is not just a toy or gaming system.  It's a tool who's potential is just being realized.  I use it for mostly for exercise.  Virtual reality boxing is free with the device.  It's a great workout!  Additionally, the educational possibilities are endless.  A virtual walk through Italy over a text book any day.  I also saw the Foo Fighters, Roots and Snoop Dogg in V-concert free.  This being said, it also emulates reality in that to experience different and more exciting things One has to spend money.  If you bought a playstation you would have to buy games anyway.  Also, you will have to join Facebook. I opened an account just for Oculus.  Now I get 4 text messages a day about facebook friends I don't have.  I can see why people hate Facebook, I mean META.

I would say this is good. There are some fantastic immersive games that just take a completely different spin. Resident evil is amazing on this. I have a psvr and the quality of this is better! Unfortunately there are so many cool things that they could do that they have not. The app library for movies is terrible! Barely anything I use is supported and the things that are, work terribly. Certain apps barely load and when they do, they barely take advantage of the 3D or VR. So essentially it does the job when it comes to games and the browser but everything else could be way better if it was better supported. Many people complain about the Facebook sign in. Who cares? If you don’t have Facebook, don’t get it. If you have Facebook, then don’t complain because I’m pretty sure everyone does not read the terms and conditions anyway, so what difference does it make.

Amazing headset, no complaints about the product whatsoever.My problem is with the $50 Promotion.It only appears in small text below the listing how you are able to acquire the $50 gift. I assumed the gift would be presented after check-out, but nope nothing since I ""didn't enter the Promo Code""... really disappointed that it wasn't more clear how to redeem this Promotion and I kind of think this was intentional so they wouldn't have to shell out the $50 to folks like me who do not always read the tiny fine print at the end of the product. So I got screwed out of the $50 I though came with the unit and honestly influenced me to buy it.Buyer beware, ENTER THE PROMO CODE BEFORE YOU PURCHASE!!

As much as I absolutely despise Facebook, I have to admit, you can't beat what you're getting for the price. The next step up from this is around $700-$1000, and is very minimally better. If you want to get into VR, go with Occulus. If you can't bite the bullet for Facebook, just wait for the prices to drop further. Also, the Facebook account thing has inconsistent information floating around. You have to make an Occulus account, not a Facebook account to use it. There is a massive difference that people tend to ignore completely. I made an account and not once did it show up on Facebook, even when searched. OCCULUS ACCOUNTS ARE SEPERATE FROM FACEBOOK!

Bought this for my kids for Christmas and they loved it. They have asked for one for a few years now and we have not had the funds to get it for them. When Amazon offered this on interest free payments, I jumped on it. My kids entire Christmas was made! They couldn't believe they finally got that expensive toy they have begged for, for a while. So thank you for offering the payments, without that we couldn't have done it. They love it so much I have not gotten to play much but I did get to do the roller coaster simulator briefly. I had to sit down to do it, it was so realistic that when I attempted standing up I was getting dizzy. Not in a bad way, just felt real and thought well I don't ride roller coasters standing up, maybe I should sit down. I also like the fact that the games seem to be more affordable than other gaming systems.

This product is amazing for its novelty with 'VR'. For new 1st time users it's as if the Big Bang characters had morphed into your room and were playing episodes of Star Trek. The idea or concept of fully immersive VR doesn't seem to have caught up with the hype. It is more like looking through your old viewfinder from 70 years ago.  And most of the games available are wipe downs of the same killer games that have been around forever but now are seen through your view finder. It's too bad so many of the games are intended for the millennial crowd instead of applications in immersive VR for adults. And I feel like I am playing with my children's leggo sets for the avatars. Be aware this is first of all a toy, and it's not marketed to an audience that can do much thought encounters.

If you're thinking about getting an Oculus Quest 2, get an Oculus Quest 2. I wasn't really aware of it until just late last year and then received one for Christmas. In short, it is awesome. Just the tutorial apps blew me away. Having had it for about a month now, I've found tons of other apps (some free, some paid) that make it well worth the cost. It's also helped me get back to working out on a regular basis as it has a lot of apps that get you moving but don't feel like a workout. Be aware that you may need to spend more money on accessories, though. The battery only lasts a few hours and the stock strap and face cover are just okay. I wear glasses and use the spacer and AMVR lens protectors and that set-up works great, but there is trial and error on getting the headset's fit right.

you may have guessed I have a rather wide face based on the headline, but I assure you I'm no Shrek!  the OQ1 fits my head just fine. After trying this for 2 weeks, with headaches and cheekbone aches all the way through, investing more time into this would have been nonsense. so I returned it, went back to Quest 1 and I have to say, I'm not missing the benefits of Quest 2 all that much.I've also tried a few facial interface, but that creates problems with smaller FOV.  the PID adjustment will not stick, wearing prescription lense mount further destroys FOV, super blurry images to the corners. in fact, the blurry images around the corners was a downgrade from Quest1 IMO.the sharper resolution didn't really do a lot for me, nor helped in sense of immersion because of those damn FOV issues, blurry corners and the general pain.I hope they decide to accommodate people with wider faces with their next revision.

I have absolutely enjoyed the heck out of this headset. It's fun and the fact that someone on my budget could afford it is really something. I wouldn't have had a VR set if it weren't for this being as affordable as it is. There are some shortcuts clearly taken to help keep it affordable but the actual VR hardware is amazing. Visuals are clear and immersive and it keeps up with my movements very well. If you don't have the money for something like an Index or Vive but want VR this is a great choice. It's also pretty sturdy. I've punched my table so hard my knuckles bled and the controller barely had a mark on it. You also can't tell I've headbutted my desk multiple times trying to pick up guns and rotwiener cores lol.Lets get complaints out of the way first:• The original strap the headset came with is 100% the absolute worst part of the headset.Do yourself a favor and snag the Kiwi Design head strap while you're here on Amazon. The original strap squeezed the heck out of my head and if I loosened it the headset could flop around a bit causing blurry graphics and just being uncomfortable for a different reason. Due to that constant squeeze it gave me some nasty headaches usually after 2-3 hours of gameplay but sometimes much sooner and they could last the rest of the day. While they're nothing compared to a cluster headache for pain they were still what I'd consider bad.• Air link was awesome and worked great but was broken within a week of receiving the headset likely due to a patch (0.37 I think).I didn't get to enjoy it and the only potential bit of troubleshooting I have left to try as far as I've found is a factory reset which I'm reluctant to do. I bought a 3rd party link cable which is working well enough for me but I'd really like to be able to take my gaming to my living room where I have much less risk of punching or breaking anything and have some room to physically move around.• I don't really like having to be signed in with a Facebook account.I don't think this is going to change anytime soon if ever though.I've played Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades (H3VR), Blade & Sorcery, Pavlov, and Legendary Tales with my headset. I've played around 76 hours since I got it and aside from the headaches problem (which I've solved recently) it's been absolutely amazing and immersive. I've also used it to watch youtube, streaming shows, and movies. I absolutely love the thing for every use I've had for it so far. It's an absolute blast to experience actually fighting an opponent yourself whether it be that sniper in his tower or a bunch of knights. Just through the games themselves there's an amazing amount of stuff to experience but adding mods makes it even better. This headset can get your foot in the door to worlds you've always wanted to see in person at a pretty cheap price compared to it's competitors. Past video game levels, fantasy settings, all sorts of places to see and things to do.An aspect you might have been thinking about is this is a great fitness tool even without dedicated fitness apps. Before you realize it you'll be sweaty and tired from swinging your arms, moving around, and holding your arms in front of you for surprisingly long periods of time. Pretty much anything you do with your VR will involve some level of activity and the gaming will almost certainly help kick your butt into shape. You should still visit the gym and make sure you're eating right though.I have only done gaming through PCVR and SteamVR. I have not tried any of the games for the headset on it's own nor do I expect to anytime soon. If you're looking for info on them then sorry but I can't help you with that.There's several improvements I'd love to see either through future patches or future products. Probably the easiest would be the ability to verify and repair to latest patch the headset software from settings (if it's there I haven't found it). That way if my air link problem is software based I could fix it easily without having to do something like factory resetting the thing. If not then that's one more troubleshooting step I can cross off on my own fairly easily. In the next model or with an accessory if it's possible one thing I'd like is a second dedicated charge port allowing the use of a link cable and a charger with more oomph than a PC's USB 3 port would typically have for longer play times both at the same time. Another thing I'd like is a fabric cover. While the silicone cover is nice and stops the foam from irritating my face I'd love to have an official machine washable fabric facial interface cover that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.

The Oculus Quest system is a great VR console for the average person. Its affordable and a new technology.I reccomend it, though I do want to note the requirements of a facebook is dangerous thing and should not be praised, even if you don't mind it. Please get a alternate account for VR if you do, and make privacy and authentification settings airtight. It is very common for personal accounts to get targeted for a plethora of reasons. Attaching a payment method to social, public media is a bad idea. Be careful.However, this review is not about the console itself, but Amazon. After receiving my package, I thought things were odd. For instance the sleeve was ripped and poorly tapped back together. The inside was also ripped. The contents, aside from the main electronics, were all over the place, unsecure. Initial thoughts were shipping was rough. However, there was more. Dust on controllers, the pull-tabs already removed and in box, and I happened to google an unboxing video. This had been unsealed and opened. I bought a new verion, from Amazon as the seller.The second thought was someone wanted to test it, maybe something happened, but it was still brand new. However, if I saw this in a store, I would look for a nicer box out of concern for quality. This is not ""new"" to a collector of gaming tech! This is not new to a happy child on their birthday or holiday.Upon further research to see if I was an unique case, I found a discovery: Amazon receives returned items, and often markets them as brand new. In some cases this can be fine - wrong unopened item - and I believe it's better than some companies practices of discarding the item for profit, but it is lying, untruthful, and plain scamming.I will likely be keeping this, as I'm privileged to afford this and need it for a project, and later it will be a hand-me-down for my mother. It would only be likely recycled again or just thrown out.It works perfectly. Nothing is damaged at all - its truly new! But there have been times not like my experience that other items have been found inside instead of the intended headset. I also believe that with the market how it is currently, with illness and shortages, it was likely sold at a ""used"" price compared to some other places. I even looked for a used one, and couldn't find one (I don't personally care for this exact system). So it's fine for me, and I can save someone else from being scammed by this system.With my newfound knowledge, however, I will not be buying things from Amazon again. I suggest you be careful also!

Quest 2 lost a star because it isn't big enough to fit over my glasses well, even with the larger faceplate Oculus offers, and because setting up Link to a computer takes several minutes and requires navigating the Quest 2's menus and the PC menus, which means your taking the headset on and off a couple of times. Compared to the Oculus Rift S I already owned, which connects to the PC immediately and fits my head well, it is not as friendly towards PC gaming and larger headed people with glasses.It still gets 4 stars because it's an affordable system that can be used without a decent gaming PC.If you are a PC gamer with some money and want to play VR primarily while connected to your PC, I would advice buying a different headset.If you're on a budget, don't have a gaming PC, and/or don't have a large head or wide glasses, Quest 2 is a  good choice and will save you money with the added bonus of being able to travel without being plugged into a PC (at a cost of some computing power), so you can take it on vacation.The ability to be a travelling/standalone system is unique to Quest, so if that's important to you add another star to my review.If you're wanting to play primarily on PC and/or have wide glasses, subtract a star from my review.

I wrote a previous review about my NC75 Pro Headphones- they are awesome.  Recently, my headphones stopped working as I was listening to them; I had only had them for less that six months. I couldn't figure out what happened. I read the instructions to see what it could be, but couldn't find anything. I contacted Srhythm on their website through email and explained the issue.  The company/Staff was great in helping and supporting the issue.  I was told that the problem could have been a defect in the headphones.  I was very pleased and satisfied with Stella's, and Eva's quick response back each time I emailed. All they wanted me to do was send them the order number, and a video of the problem. I did that.  The next email I received was letting me know that I was approved to receive another set of headphones with the attachments included.  Delivery was 5 -7 days- I received them in less time than that.  As I write this review, I have on my new headphones listening to my favorite music.  I recommend buying from Srhythm- they do respond back in a timely manner, and care about their customers.  They responded in a positive manner and resolved the issue.  I'm back to my routine of enjoying and using my NC75 Pro headphones. I am a happy camper.  Sincerely, Ursulla (very happy camper)

It's really a pretty cool experience. Even a lot of the free content through the TV app is cool.Like, you can experience cities from the vantage point of a drone flying over them. Or people paramotoring far from civilization.The games are also pretty immersive. I hadn't played games in quite a while, but I've been playing more on this because it's more engaging overall.The main benefit of the Quest though, is that it's really cheap compared to other VR headsets and has a larger library of games. The Varjo Aero might be better, but the basic headset costs $2K, and then you need additional hardware to make it work.The Meta Quest 2 gives you a pretty good experience for $300... Unless its IPD adjustments don't match the width of your eyes.  But for the most part that hasn't bothered anyone I know too much.Your eyes also seem to adapt some after you've used the headset regularly for a bit. I used to find it a little blurry in one eye but now it almost immediately seems clear when I put it on.

Let me start by saying that this item is amazing! I bought it for my 11 year old,  tried it myself,  and I was amazed.  You do need a Facebook account to use it,  but that's easy to set up and get going.  Games cost roughly 29.99 to buy,  so that's an extra cost, right off the bat,  on top of this product cost.  My son has an average size room,  and it was easy to set a boundary so he didn't smash into a wall while playing.  The only bummer was the rash he got on his face from the headset. We tried the silicone piece that came with the headset,  tried wiping the headset down, the rash got worse until the headset became unusable.  I guess only a small percentage of people are unable to play for that reason,  but I wish someone would have left a review letting me know it was a thing.  Good luck!!

I have been having a ton of fun with this VR set but found myself frustrated when it suddenly wouldn’t charge after about a month of use. Talking to customer service and searching the internet I found out sometimes if you try to charge immediately after a long playing session, the internal battery will not hold a charge because it it overheated. The device never feels hot, so it isn’t possible to know whether or not your battery is overheated. Best tip I can give is always give your device at least 20 minutes to cool before plugging it in to charge. I know, that adds time and is annoying but it’s the only thing I’ve found that really works. This is a consistent problem from what I’ve been reading. I hope Meta/Oculus figures out how to prevent this in future models.

I got the Quest 2 and was exited to get started with it. Went through the setup and made a facebook account to do the setup. Was pretty annoyed that I needed a FB account to use my Quest but whatever. After I got done with the setup the Facebook account instantly got disabled. With that I cant use the Quest besides going into it and looking around. Screw Facebook. If youre going to force me to use it DONT LOCK ME OUT FOR USING IT!!! If you have a facebook account already and use it im sure youll be fine but if you dont have account be aware that you'll probably have the same issueEdit:So after going to support that didn't help at all cause it's a Facebook issue I just reset the thing and made a new account and no issues with that. And I gotta say not having to deal with wires sbd being able to play anywhere is very nice. I have a HTC vive with wireless but this is a way better wireless experience. It's just a shame the Facebook requirement really effected my initial opinion on it and makes gard to recommend to anyone who don't already use facebook. But ill give it 3 stars cause of the ease of use

The system was very minimalistic, simplistic, and easy to setup. Think of this as a console since most free games will start to get boring relatively soon, so be ready to purchase some games for it. Also kind of sucks that it requires a Facebook to use. Otherwise it is an amazing system and the fact that it’s wireless is a complete game changer! Highly recommend.

I’m a mom of 3. Bought this for Christmas for my 15-year-old son, but my daughters & I loved it so much we ended up buying another. We love Beatsaber and Job Simulator the most. I’ve tried some horror walk-through games, but they make me seasick still. I’m hoping I’ll get my “sea legs” soon lol. The biggest downside is the weight of the headset, in my opinion. It’s a bit on the heavier side. I’m assuming in a few years there will be more lightweight models,  it for now this totally suffices.

Overall this product is very average.  Packaging is very nice though!VR is very cool.. I think in a few years.. maybe 4-5.. VR is going to be a very very fun experience with visuals that will WOW a person.  Right now, those types of ""WOWs"" are limited to VR sets that are $1000.. this reasonable $300 VR set allows a person to have a nibble of what's possible and what might be coming to the future with  a very low visual quality.When watching youtube VR.. the videos are very very low quality.The limited eye adjustments of only 3 will have a lot of people looking at blurred VR.There are requirements that people need to follow in order to use this hardware.. requirements that are unreasonable, but reasonable enough for most people.

While I do believe VR is the future in gaming I don’t think Occulus is it. Although  comparatively low priced it falls short for many reasons: It’s always blurry, creates eye strain , too heavy, uncomfortable head strap, too few games, doesn’t really facilitate glasses, randomly glitches etc etcIf not for the pandemic we would have seen Xbox & Nintendo VR by now and while PS VR is technically available getting one at a fair price is difficult at best. Consoles are bought for the games that are available for them and the Occulus library is too sparse.Clearly consumers want VR and will tolerate even crappy VR like Occulus while waiting for The Real Deal. However it will ultimately end up in the graveyard 🪦 for poor tech-as it should.

The oculus is a visually stunning experience the minute you put it on you are taken into different worlds and will definitely forget where you are. The games range in price from $10-$60 there are family friendly games and advanced adult games that are actually scary! Pretty easy to figure out with the tutorials and you don’t need to use the TV at all I would say the only downside is that you need a Facebook account which it seems they just use for trying to promote the product

The quest 2 is awesome. It’s a computer! You can search the web in 3D, watch p***, play awesome games with a non toxic community. It has some absolutely amazing features….you can even connect your computer to it and work in 3D with your colleagues. I am hard to please and I was blown away. It’s not “gimmicky”; sure the games are still being developed, but the more users they get, the more games will come out.I work out with this!!! Even the lightsaber game will give you a fun workout.Buy one, you won’t be disappointed…unless you have a 2000$ computer and can run the big boy VRs.Just my 2 cents.I walked around my house at night with my headset on, dark as heck, and ate, took a poop, all while watching Netflix.

If you use the quest for exercise, expect it to be blurry 1/2 the time. I use the quest mostly to play beat saber and these problems are not solvable mostly due to triggering system problems when trying to work around blurry issues. Two major sources of blurriness: fogging and headset moving down on the face due to its weight and sweat making the silicone pad slippery.To reduce fogging, hang out in the same room with headset for 15 min but don’t do any exercise during that time. Your face and the headset need to be close to the same temp. This will reduce fogging but won’t eliminate it because exercise causes you body temp to rise.To keep the headset from blurring, you can try tightening the straps but, that will eventually trigger a system issue where the headset will temporarily go black and/or pause the game. Adjusting the headset while in game can trigger the same issue.Removing the headset and wiping away sweat can cause multiple problems such as fogging, loss of guardian, going blank or triggering of other system issues. If it works, it will quickly slip down again going blurry.I have tried the standard and elite strap. My next experiment is to try a counter balanced strap.Note: I have not mentioned the multiple system issues that combined with the blurry problem will eventually cause me to give up and let the quest collect dust.

This is the best video game system I've ever had! The visuals are breathtaking and the games are so immersive and enjoyable. I've actually purchased two of these 😄.Google Chrome cast is a must. It's very annoying when you can't see whats going on in the headset. You can cast it to your phone in the oculus app, but of course, that's a very tiny screen.3 best games to start with:1. Beat Saber - a rhymn game where you slash blocks to the beat2. Moss - an action/puzzle game with a very captivating storyline.3. Super Hot - a game where you fight red glass people. A little tense, but so fun!You can find all of these games in the oculus store

I am not a big gamer, but I am truly enjoying the fitness app Supernatural.  It has got me moving (and liking it) for the first time in a long time.  The Oculus is amazing, and I'm sure I have only scratched the surface of all it can do.  I only took off a star because I have had to buy several accessories in order to use the headset comfortably while exercising.  I have purchased a headband, face masks, anti-fog spray and a fan attachment.  The fan attachment works great at keeps lenses clear.  Also, the subscription to Supernatural was an additional purchase.  I think it's worth it to make exercise fun. Overall, I really love the Oculus, but be prepared to spend extra $$ on apps and accessories.

The first one they sent me was acting up right out of the box. It kept losing tracking and couldn't recognize guardians. I went through every possible troubleshooting step by myself and with meta customer care and they wanted me to send it in and said that would take a couple months. So I just had it replaced through Amazon and they sent a replacement in one day. The one I have now hasn't lost tracking once and works great. If you have problems with yours I would just return it through amazon and skip the whole manufacturer customer care thing because that wasted hours of my life and was very frustrating. Overall this thing is pretty cool 😎

I have never experienced VR before. Setting up was easy once I knew what to do. The sound quality is surprisingly good, the headset is comfortable, I wear glasses and it's a little snug even with the glasses spacer but my glasses are slightly bigger than the recommended size. I usually only play VR for an hour or two so the battery life lasts long enough for this factor.This headset is my new favorite hobby, game system, activity, etc.For the price, and the fact it requires nothing to set up, this experience cannot be compared to. VR is a beautiful technology, and I have never been happier with this purchase.

First off, Amazon says I have to prove I didn't receive the $50 gift card - looks like I'm not the only one that didn't receive one. The quest is great when it works. I've had to factory reset once already to solve a black screen issue. I would put it on my head, adjust it at any time and it would go black and beep, need to shake my head around to get screen back or reboot. Frustrating when you're in the middle of a game! Also, it goes to sleep when watching a movie or guided meditation and it constantly wants me to setup the guardian area again. A factory reset helped the black screen issue for about a day. I'm RMAing this one because I don't think something should have to be reset within the first week of use and don't think I should have to prove to Amazon that I didn't receive the gift card when they can see others are having the same issue. Very frustrated with Amazon. I'll buy another one, but not from Amazon.

I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. He used it for boxing workouts. After a month or so, the Oculus got stuck in a boot loop and wouldn’t turn on … just kept trying to boot up without success. He went through Meta support. He was told to box up the device and mail it. He kept checking in, but weeks later the replacement hadn’t arrived. It finally did, rebranded as Meta Quest 2. It worked for a few days, then it got the black screen of death. Support has taken days to get back to him, then they finally replied and told him to do a factory reset. He’d tried that before he contacted them. So far, he probably has been without a working device longer than he’s had a working device. And he’s been extremely frustrated in his dealings with customer service. This whole experience has been unacceptable. It was a splurge gift that he should be able to enjoy. Instead, he’s spent a good portion of the warranty period without a working device.

You've bought this. You're excited by it. Can't wait to get into playing, and exploring. You've bought a bunch of accessories. Official accessories. But, then you use it.The biggest flaw in the engineering of this unit is, ventilation. There is no fix for it, via Oculus. There are a few third party companies that offer face plates that might help and 1...and I mean ""1"" small mountable fan unit that sucks hot air out to help with the lenses fogging up and you sweating like you're in a sauna.C'mon Oculus...which is now no more, or atleast absorbed by FB/Meta. You couldn't have constructed your own accessorie(s) to eliminate the issue??So, if you are considering it. Just know that you may get away with using it for an hour without starting to sweat. And, forget boxing or using the workout/fitness apps.All in all the experience, though dampened by the ventilation issue, is fun. The ability to not be tethered to a wire nor a lit of Oculus store apps, is my fav plus. Hook it up to your capable pc, and play other pc vr compatible games.

First: delivery to Russia took 3 weeks. Item arrived well packaged, customs taxes were around $15.The headset itself is a mixed bag.From one side, in *some* apps the immersion is amazing. But those apps and videos are extremely rare. You can only find really immersive videos in the Oculus TV app. They look like 8K 3D, and they are very impressive.There's a lot of 360 degree videos on Youtube, but Quest 2 can only play them in 4K. And in this resolution they look like if you run lowest quality 360p heavily compressed Youtube video on your 50"" TV. I mean it's ugly.Those (seemingly) 8K 3D videos from Oculus TV mostly require to be downloaded before playback. And their resolution looks like 720p on 50"" TV. Definitely not amazing in terms of resolution, but still very immersive. I can only wander how immersive will be 12K and 24K 3D videos in the distant future.The main problem is... I already watched most of these videos in a week. There's nothing left. All other videos even in Oculus TV are between bad and ugly in quality.On the ""home screen"" (or home ambience) everything looks like...well... if you had a myopia.The headset often ""forgets"" the safe play area, and shows positioning errors. A couple of days ago I had to reboot it twice to get rid of this error.All in all, it feels like both technology and content are still in the early development stage. Maybe in 5-10 years it will really become a mature product, but now it's more of a concept or demo.I didn't try Quest 2 linked to PC because I don't have a compatible PC.And the games... well, those I tried to play look like back to 90's. Visual quality is from bad to mediocre, gameplay is extremely simple and limited, but pricing is like AA titles on PC.Notice: I use Quest 2 as a standalone headset. This is my first VR headset, I have nothing to compare.

Bought two of these, spoiled I know but wanted to be able to play against/with one another with family and friends. Easy setup just need Facebook accounts which for some may not be right.First one worked fine for awhile then the headstrap broke so need to replace it and the oculus branded one is not cheap. Then the left toggle starts to drift. We think the sensor gets dirty so some alcohol is supposed to work but if not may have to replace.The second oculus we ordered was good for about a day then the left toggle didn't work at all and no matter of reset or cleaning worked. Thankfully we just got it so it was an easy full replacement of the Oculus for a new one which was an easy and fast process.Other than that, time will tell but I think the more use, the more wear so I'd imagine more replacement parts but they are fun for what they are.

The only problem keeping this thing from reaching perfection is the absolute necessity of having a Facebook account in order to use it. Especially with Facebook's recent trend of completely deleting accounts with little to no actual investigation when a person gets hacked, or an image gets taken out of context.  You lose everything.

Es decir, están pensadas para jugar de forma autónoma, sin necesidad de cables porque tienen su propia batería!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Los juegos son muy divertidos, he probado el Beat Saber (el juego TOP del que todos hablan) y es fabuloso, pero también testeé el super hot, y es increíblemente inmersivo, muy pero muy divertido!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Los controles con precisos, perfectos casi, el reconocimiento de movimiento es milimétrico, y todo responde de maravilla.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️El sistema Guardián es impresionante, puedes delimitar tu área de juego, incluso puedes ""escanear"" tu sofá para jugar cómodamente en él.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️El sonido es muy bueno, realmente suena bien, me gustaría probarlo con audífonos.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️La batería dura lo suficiente, se echa en falta carga rápida (sobre todo porque utiliza conector usb-c).⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️La pantalla es muy buena, incluso funciona a 120hz!💥Puntos no tan fuertes💥Las correas no son muy cómodas, toma su tiempo ajustarlas. Es casi una compra obligada una correa de mayor calidad.El punto justo de visión es variable dependiendo de cada persona, pero su ajuste es bastante complicado, toma su tiempo y varios intentos.Se echa en falta una funda de serie para protegerlos (no les puede dar la luz del sol, o se quema la pantalla, atención con este detalle!).Los controles deberían tener una referencia física de R y L (derecha e izquierda) es fácil confundirlos.Deberían incluir algunos juegos precargados, o bien algunos juegos de regalo al comprar el equipo, para poder utilizarlo y testearlo a full, antes de pasar por caja.⚠️Exige utilizar una cuenta de Facebook, la privacidad se ve completamente comprometida, además, si la cuenta es dada de baja por la empresa, se pierden todas las compras y dólares invertidos en la misma, mucho cuidado con eso! ⚠️----------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusión.Es un producto superior, a un precio muy bajo en relación a lo que ofrece.Indispensable para todo gamer, es mucho más divertido que las consolas de sobremesa, y el efecto WOW es totalmente real, es otro mundo, y la experiencia es alucinante.Le pongo un 9, es un producto casi perfecto.Súper recomendado!

If I take out the new battery for the right one and put it back in, it works fine for only about 10 minutes then says check battery & disconnects again. Charge on headset lasts about 30 minutes if that. Noticed when first purchased battery lasted on headset for 45 to 50 minutes. Manufacturer makes it difficult to request warranty help.

Excellent VR, I have tried most of the VR's in the market and I can say the Oculus Quest 2 is the very best out there. Excellent immersion, a very complete and robust marketplace. Being Android can't go wrong. It's excellent for gaming the VR quality games, it's quite good for reading, great for watching videos. Comfortable navigating with the super responsive controllers and quite easy to type on the virtual keyword.The headset is quite comfortable and adjustable to your eyesight. If you wear glasses it has an additional extension you can put but I felt it was putting too much stress on my glasses and they might break so I don't wear them with the Oculus. But unless you have considerable sight loss you probably won't need to wear them with the Oculus.*Downsides:* as good as it is the technology of VR is still extremely limited and it's pretty much just watching a big screen around you like if you were in a planetarium. You will not feel the level of realism or immersion of Cyberpunk genre Science Fiction. We are decades or maybe even a century away from that.The headset is comfortable but if you wear it for over an hour it starts getting very uncomfortable and some people might get headaches.It's still mostly a gimmick to have fun. For work, meetings, or ""adult"" practical use is mostly useless.Some people will have issue that you are forced to use your Facebook account.Different profiles / accounts is kind of tedious. It's probably best for single person use.If you are in stationary mode it's good for watching videos or reading. But to fully experience it or game with it you need lots of space, 6.5 sqft so be conscious of that before buying.

Privacy concerns aside this is a great platform and clearly is the future of gaming. Not so sure about the whole metaverse thing. I prefer the real verse truth be told. The big issue is it being linked to facebook. I had been off of facebook for years but had to re-enable my account just to set this thing up. Hopefully the promised non-facebook accounts will be forthcoming from ""Meta"". Otherwise for $300 this thing is insane. The Star Wars games are amazing! Its like you're in the movie!

Tech support from amazon and Facebook is completely useless. Had this for three months and it developed a freezing issue every few seconds. Amazon passed me off to meta (Facebook) and meta keeps trying to make me do troubleshooting methods that don’t work and now they want video proof that is impossible to provide. I’ve been disconnected three times from chat and each time they want to review chat logs and then they disconnect. Save your time and money. It’s not that great of an experience even when it does work. Way overhyped.

First,I didn't want to get it after hearing other reviews. My 13 yr old son really wanted it, so it was a gift. Very cool, but I told him you'll start doing crap like it's reality. So after 20 minutes he's nauseous bad! Literally at the toilet. Then he was playing a game where he's an ape and has to move himself with his arms to walk... So what happens when he stops playing? He starts walking down the hallway moving his arms like the ape. Lol whatever.. he doesn't want to return it but definitely can not play long. He still thinks it's cool.

Im honestly shocked at how great the Quest 2 is and bummed I waited so long. I was a relatively early adopter of the PSVR but this destroys that device in ergonomics. It’s also wireless so you can turn around full 360° without worrying about wires, which gives a lot more immersion. Tons of content. Bummed I’ll never be able to play Half-life Alyx because I’m not a PC guy, but for the price, this VR headset can’t be beat!

I am not thrilled about the quality,  its very hard to adjust to your eyes and does not have ability to change the focus to make it sharp.  You not notice it when you look at entire screen,  but if you want to watch movie or open browser it will be not perfectly clear,  and you will have not fun using it :(  I think the idea is good but the technology needs better quality parts !

I've been looking forward to virtual reality for a long time but the games just don't do it for me. I don't even care about Facebook or how comfortable it is, I just wish there were better games.In a nutshell it feels like 95% of the games are pumped out with the exact same style artwork, mediocre music and sound effects, and not a lot of depth. After only playing a few titles you start to grow sick of it. There are only a few ""real"" games available on this system. If there were even a system that recreated your favorite old school 8-bit games in sudo-VR it would blow this system out of the water. They really missed the mark on what makes a game good.

I am not a fan of facebook, I started with PSVR, then went to the vive cosmos elite, then to the valve index. The big thing that those other headsets are lacking is good wireless support, which the quest has.  I didn't want to like it, but the feeling of having no wires, controllers that aren't bad (once you get the knuckle straps) and decent resolution.. It's really good especially when you consider the price it starts at.  The main thing that I wish it did better in is FOV, it's not bad, but it isn't as good and the index, which is fair when again, you consider how much it costs and what you get.

Only thing people say negative about it is because FB login. Who the hell cares. If you can’t beat them join them. When I’m dead they can have all my info I won’t need it. Now the oculus is definitely the best bang for your buck. Battery last about a good 2 hours but you can charge and play it at the same time. I would recommend getting a guard for your remotes. There plastic and like to bang around a lot. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Best experience in my opinion and yes I have glasses and they fit comfortably.

This virtual reality headset makes me feel like I am living in the future. I don't hate the console style monetization as that encourages development of new games, despite the high price tag. At least for now there is no subscription service and that will suffice for now. Besides there are many great free games as well, such as Echo VR and Pavlov Shack Beta.The stock headset comes with an ok strap and lackluster battery life both of which can be remedied with more money for an improved strap, some of which come with batteries.Virtual Reality sickness is very real and you will most likely experience it in your first couple games where your body movement does not line up with your character movement, such as in Echo VR. This problem doesn't exist in Beat Saber or Super Hot and you can exclusively play stationary games if you so choose.Overall, the Oculus (Meta) Quest 2 brings virtual reality to the masses with a plethora of super cool features, hand tracking and passthrough are both pretty good. However, the relatively low price point gives it some drawbacks that are acceptable at this stage of the game.

Okay so if you encounter this review you may be surprised why I have not blindly given this product a solid 5 stars.First things first, the pros. It is an overall good and functional HMD. Unlike the compeition, it supports both standalone software for those that do not have a VR ready gaming PC. PCVR connectivity is pretty much plug and play if you do decide to go through that style of gameplay. It also has a wireless option if your home network can support it.Another thing is that setup is extremely easy. Inside out tracking is pretty decent and does not require basestations or lighthouses for tracking unlike the competition. The resolution is higher in comparison to the previous iterations of Oculus HMDs. This HMD is a good entry level VR headset.Now for the cons. Off the bat, the stock strap is not really good. I can see children and adults with below average head sizes being fine with the headstrap but, for an average or larger adult head size, you won't be able to play for more than 30 minutes without the headset putting strain towards your cheekbones. Other cases have reported irritation to the ears. The only solution to this would be to invest in their ""elite strap"" which in my opinion, should have been the stock strap. To be honest, a 3rd party halo strap would be a better investment than their OEM elite strap.Now for the facial interface. It is sandpaper to the face. If you ordered this HMD prior to having an included silicone cover, expect to get face marks and rashes. Although the new silicone cover has prevented further problems, it is still not comfortable as the cushioning is still too firm on the interface itself. Expect to spend more for a 3rd party facial interface.Now for gameplay and experience. Remember how earlier I mentioned the increased resolution from previous Oculus models, it does not matter now. If you are someone who is planning to solely use this HMD for PCVR/SteamVR, you're gonna have a hard time wondering how this is an upgrade from other HMDs on the market. The amount of compression and artifacts I have noticed playing is just beyond acceptable. I do not understand why Facebook (or Meta whatever) decided to solely use USB C to encode both audio and video through the headset. They could've at least made use of adding a display port (or even an HDMI port for all I care). The increase in resolution is useless at this point. Even if you change and max out settings through their desktop app, debug tool and 3rd party Oculus tray tool, those same artifacts and compression in image quality is noticable. The HTC Vive has a better PCVR experience than this considering that it is older. I can understand that the main purpose of this headset was to be a consumer friendly standalone headset but for those of us that bought this thinking it would be a step up for PCVR gameplay, I am sorry to say this but we were scammed. I am hoping that the developers do realize that is a problem and consider investing a good portion of their time finding a credible solution. If you think about it, the hardware power is there with the Quest 2, but the software implementation and execution is extremely buggy.Finally defects. Unfortunately, when my Quest 2 arrived, it came with a defective right touch controller. The issue was that the thumb capacitor was not sensing thumb movement. This is gamebreaking if you play games with hand gestures. Moreover, my unit came with dead pixels when bringing up passthrough mode. Although not game breaking, it was still annoying. After looking through some online forums, these seemed to be consistent problems with other people. Luckily Amazon offered to exchange my unit for a completely brand new one free of charge.Overall it is a functional HMD and a steal for the price but it still has a long way to becoming the greatest HMD on the market. More importantly, PCVR experience. I would advise the developers to look further to improving PCVR as a significant amount of people bought this for that sole purpose. With rumours of a Valve Index 2 in the works with supposed standalone support included, Oculus needs to find a way to keep up.Update: I just received replacement Amazon sent me to replace my defective unit turns out to be much worse. There is rattling components inside and I was advised by support to replace it again due to risk of short circuiting! I am actually worried that something might blow up while I am playing. I have downgraded my rating from 2 stars to 1. If the 3rd replacement is still defective, I am refunding ASAP. I don't know if it is just me but the quality control has been poor so far.

Go to oculus webiste and go to support, make sure to open a chat window, dont call them or do an email, because quite frankly, you're as impatient as me. The chat window option is hard to find for support but if the gods bless you then you will stumble upon its beauty. Right off the bat (being impatient) open the ticket with what you want done, unlinking. The way I finally got support to do it for me was not making it an option, I made it clear I was not requesting to unlink, I NEEDED to unlink, it was a NEED. Not a request. You paid 299 for this bad boi and you deserve some authoritay. I also made it clear that oculus was my issue (bamboozled them) saying I wanted to unlink my oculus from my facebook, not vice versa, and not is that it was possible. That it was happening.

I am pretty late to the party about the Quest 2. I only started to become interested in VR ever since my sis got the Valve Index. But I couldn't get one because of the skin irritation people got from wearing the headset. But ever since they announced they will bring it back twice the storage for the same price, it was a no-brainer decision. Then I heard rumors about a new Quest headset getting announced at the end of October. Oh well, I love using the Quest 2 so far. But, if you have an intention to get a Quest headset right now, I suggest you wait until what Facebook has to say.

Great product. Used it for almost 3 weeks. $299 is not much expensive compared with a full set of Index VR($999). Of course, to play games on desktop, index can bring much better experience to players. However, comes to flexibility, Quest 2 is the best for now. No base station is required, just set up the guardian and play at anytime, anyplace. There are many games on oculus store, but they are not very attracted to me. I mostly used it to play desktop games as a replacement of index, my experience is great. Can go wired (oculus link, charging while playing) and fully wireless (air link).Overall, if you are that person like me, want to try VR but don’t want to invest much on it, Quest 2 could be the best option. I don’t like the Facebook company but I appreciate the Quest 2 develop team. They keep adding new features in each experimental update.

It’s super fun and the graphics are amazing :)! I was afraid it would be too heavy but it’s very light. It’s comfortable to wear, but I would recommend a $30 elite strap because the white fabric strap gets very dirty and you can’t clean it nicely. An elite strap it also very helpful for active games. The battery time for the console isn’t very good, but there are cons to something as light and power consuming as this. Some elite straps have battery packs, but it’s probably not good for you to be in vr over 2 hours anyway and it might be uncomfortably heavy. The experience of vr is a MUST HAVE, and for 300 bucks and 128gb it’s a STEAL! If you plan to play games like beatsaber, definitely get controller protectors. I am impressed with their durability (I have SMASHED them super hard against each other and my walls) and they haven’t cracked yet but i’m going to quick buy some covers now to be safe. Over all, pretty much all cons are expected results of the pros, and I would recommend!

The image quality is good.  The controls are comfortable.  If you're looking for mobile VR, this will probably work, so long as you don't require a large library of games, because this device has only a handful of decent titles, and the rest of its library is of extremely low quality.Battery life is abysmal.  Device has serious power management issues.  The oculus link cable is advertised as charging it while you use the device.  This is a lie.  A blatant, bold-faced lie.  Don't waste your money on it.

I take the device out of the box, connect it to my homes wifi, and the thing refuses to install an update. Stuck at ""Update 1 of 2 0%"" for over an hour. I contacted support over the internet on my PC and they told me to do a factory reset. The thing is literally straight from the factory. But I gave them the benefit of the doubt and followed the instructions for a factory reset. I reconnect to my home wifi and....still stuck at 0% update. I'm not sure what else to do. This was a birthday present for my son.

My 13 year-old son said this was his coolest Christmas present! All the adults have enjoyed playing it, too. We explored the world through the Wander app. We had so much fun watching each other, and got some great laughs. Beware if you add the roller coaster. I can’t believe how real it feels. I had horrible motion sickness after that one though. I seriously couldn’t believe that I felt like I was going down the tracks of a coaster while standing in the living room.The only downside for me is that most of the games that he wants cost around $25 or more.It does come with free games, but he gets tired of them pretty quickly.So parents heads up about the games. After you pay the price to buy the VR set, your kid is still going to be asking for more. If anyone figures out how to get a discount code for games, I’d love to know!Another positive would be that it’s actually getting my teen out of his room. He comes in the living room with me to play his games.

I would give this Headset a 5 star but there are some pros and cons.Pros:1. Very user friendly, it gives an option to skip tutorials for more experienced users2. Inexpensive compared to other headsets especially standalone with no wires3. The built in speakers are amazing!4. The controllers are very durable, I’ve hit my walls on accident multiple times really hard, and they still work fine5. Very customizableCons:1. Even with the glasses spacer it is not very friendly for glasses users2. Lenses fog up INSANELY quick3. Built in battery life only lasts about 2-4 hours4. The stock headset straps are really uncomfortable after long use and the headset doesn’t really sit securely5. This has only happened a couple times to me, but it is a serious problem. When playing, the headset loses tracking of the controllers for a couple seconds, then they work just fine. I don’t know if this is from smacking them up against a wall or the sensors problemBesides all of the cons, this headset is DEFINITELY worth it. I got addicted instantly and it’s a great way to work out and play games at the same time. It is a PERFECT gift for anyone. I recommend buying a couple additional things like the elite strap and a charging dock, other than that, this thing is amazing! 10/10 would buy another.

I have a good time with the quest.  I use it more for fitness but do play some games with friends and I've been starting to use it for work.  There is a lot more to do with this other than gaming.  However, if you wear glasses I would highly suggest get an updated prescription and buy prescription inserts.  I did not use it for months until I got some.  The original quest had far better room and better p.d. adjustments.  If you try this with glasses you will have comfort issues and easily scratch the vr lenses.

The adjustable straps that help tighten/loosen it around your head is a nice little touch. The only thing that i dislike about it is how fast it dies. Playing it continuously for two hours minimum drains the battery significantly. On the contrary, it does not take long to charge back up to 100. Another thing i like is the amount of battery life the controllers have. The controllers come with batteries already in them and do not die quickly. Another thing, the tracking is pretty good. There are a few glitches here and there but as long as you are in proper lighting the tracking works great.

We love it so much that we got 2 more so we can have friends over and he/she can use the third one. It was not hard to follow the onscreen instruction to get it set up, but it was a bit confusing at first when trying to pair with your phone. You definitely need facebook for now to be able to sign in and use it.The games are fun, we play a lot of mutiplayer games, and for those who suffers motion sickness like I do (I have ringing ears and vertigo, get yourself a fan blowing at yourself plus take some of those verb liquid for motion sickness that you can rub behind your ears), they will help or get games that have teleport feature.The headset is bad, consider getting a more comfortable headshet or it will feel very front heavy. The bettery life for the head unit is about 2hrs. while the batteries can last over a month of here and there using it.One thing though, if you PLAN to share the quest 2 with another person, the 128g will be divided by 2 users (meaning, each user will have 64g of space for games and such), and if you have three people sharing one, it will devide the space for 3 users... so you have limited space. That said, if you plan to share it with 3 users and creating 3 acounts on one quest 2, you can set primary and share that to the other two users within the headset, and if that's the case, get the 256g one for 3 users sharing would be my suggestion.

The Quest 2 is the way to go VR. Wireless is really awesome. I already had the wired version which I thought was terrific, but wireless is much better. The thing I like best is that it contains a web browser. I can watch Netflix, log onto my Facebook account, virtually anything I can do with my laptop, I can do with Quest 2. It also is backward compatible with my old VR set, which allows me to use all of the Apps I bought for it. I just turn on my laptop and link my Quest 2 to the laptop using the app that comes with Q 2. Couldn't be happier.

First Time With VR Easy To Setup for direct use, But Facebook Instantly Banned My Account When I made It, and due to it being the weekend I had to wait till Monday (I think I set it up on Friday evening), it works well but I was pretty upset that it took so long to get it ready for PC use. I wish the battery would stay alive while using it in my PC, perhaps I need a more powerful USB power port as the wall outlet works fine with perpetual use (though I can't tolerate it after like 2 hours). It's cheap, works and it's not a bad first experience. If you don't mind facebook as a company I guess you won't mind this one.

This is amazing! My boyfriend absolutely loved is as a Christmas gift. Because the quest 2 is a mix of a console itself and a VR headset you can hook up to your computer, there are pros for buying games either through the oculus store or through steam. I suggest getting simple party games through oculus (ie job simulator) and buying games that can be modded on steam (ie boneworks).However, while there are some games that don’t require any distance moment (such as walking/running) a lot do and they’re very disorienting if you get motion sick. A pretty good indicator of whether or not you’ll be sick when playing on the quest 2 is if you get dizzy watching videos that are POV/spin frequently (ie the movie Mad Max)

This is a great entry level VR headset for kids and adults.  Like others have said the only downside is that you need a Meta (Facebook) account.  If you are tech savvy you can create a simple gmail and Meta account that does not get flagged. (Very easy if you are worried about privacy).  Told they will be removing this requirement in the future.  Provides hours of fun.  Highly recommend getting the Link cable so you can connect to pc and play other games.  May actually buy another just so we can play against each other as a family or when the kids have friends over.  Definitely recommend as you will not be disappointed for the price.

I don’t typically get motion sickness, but boy oh boy, Oculus has made me queasy a bunch of times. So do it in short time frames consistently.Also if you have glasses, it’s a bit tricky, even with the headset accommodation. I thought I’d exercise some but my glasses just fog up and the fit is odd.So I’ve enjoy the 360 videos (relaxing) on YouTube and I loved the rollercoaster (until I got motion sick).It will take some getting use to. But I love it even with the quirks.

-Much heavier than the oculus rift. You'll be feeling it on your face the entire time.-No earphones; another step down.-Extremely fragile components-Cheap plasticy feel. Seems like they cut corners in production.-Setup is a nightmare. When trying to pair it to your phone, as required, be wary of it bricking your device like it did mine. One factory reset and half a dozen attempts later, it finally connected for updates.-Charger cable is the shortest I haver ever seen-No visual indication on the plugs or ports what is right side up; bend an internal pin and you're paying for repairs or buying a new one.-Glasses spacer leaves about an inch extra where you nose should be, if you're secretly a bird then its just perfect for fitting your beak-Controllers are weirdly shaped. They don't feel natural in your hand at all.+ It powers on quickly+ The visual quality is a step up from the rift.+ The airlink allows you to connect to your pc without any additioonal cable, albeit with high requirements from both system performance and net speed.+ The calibration of Guardian was quick and painless compared to the rift, with obvious improvements in functionality. You're given the option to physically map the floor location,  and 'spray' on the boundary lines from a distance.I would suggest looking into other options in addition to the quest 2, then choose what features and drawbacks you can live with.

Once you figure things out (or, as I did, let my kids figure it out, then show me) the Oculus is a blast.  It is one step closer to the Oasis (from the book Ready Player One) (don't bother with the sequel book, it stunk).  The unit controls and hand controls are simple to use, and the pre-loaded games are enough to get going right out of the box.  Need a separate device if you want to cast to a tv, but they are inexpensive.  As a surprise gift to the family at Christmas, it was a big hit.

Yeah, its freedom unlike never before, but theres only like 20 games, if you want more games, real games. You have to do a bunch of extras to attempt to get more games hooking it up to a pc buying extras to maybe get more games, then you dont have that freedom anymore. Not enough game demos. The movement is idiotic especially in resident evil 4. The list goes on the prices for games are way to high. The free games suck. Is it worth the money, no. Watching movies or browsing the internet is just a big screen far to close to the eyes. Nothing about this product is magical. Am i writting this review to be helpful, kind of, but no.

This is the perfect headset for anyone looking to get into virtual reality. It only takes 10-15 minutes to set up, and is very easy to use. It's wireless, and you don't need anything else to get playing, just the headset. Within 10 minutes I was fully set up and playing a climbing game. If you have a VR-Ready PC then you have the option to use a feature called Airlink where you can play PC-Exclusive games on your Quest 2 wirelessly. I definitely recommend buying this headset, especially at the amazing price of $299.Some games I recommend: Eleven Table Tennis, The Climb 2, Superhot VR, Beat Saber, Gorn, Rec Room, VR Chat, Pavlov Shack, and Boneworks (PC-Exclusive)

I don't use this headset a whole lot, but it's still pretty cool. There just isn't a lot of content yet, and the content that is there costs money, so I mainly use it to watch anime and talk on VRChat, which is free. For what it's worth, the graphics are really good. I remember playing a VR game with a headset back in the 90s at a carnival or something, and this blows those old graphics out of the water. Tech really has come a long, long way. Now the question becomes: Is VR going to be a passing fad, or will lots of people start using it in their daily lives? As of now, I use it maybe once or twice a week, and I can't say I'd ever use it more than that. Then again, though, that's what I said about Facebook back in the day, and look where we are now.

There is also some confusing info on the support page, however the product itself is really solid. Good visuals, lightweight, controllers work very well.

State of the art item that seems so much more advanced than the original oculus rift. No wires, sensors to set up, nothing. Just turn on and play. because the headset itself is the console. The spacer for eyeglasses is what sold me, but if you have a large glasses, maybe try buying prescription lenses (yes, that's a thing!) for about $30. You can insert the lenses and play without your glasses! Hoping more games come out soon. Especially social interactive ones where friends can play with you on their phones.

I first got into VR several years ago with the original Vive, which I paid $600 for. And at the time that was a good price. But what many of us in VR agreed on is that while the tech is great, we need more people using it. We need more gamers and developers in the VR space, and $600 on top of a gaming PC, with a wire leading to the tower and laser devices to screw to your walls, it was never going to happen.The Quest has solved all of this. At a price point of $300 for the newest quest, you absolutely cannot match this value with any other VR hardware. On top of that, you don't need a gaming PC at all; this system is ready to boot and play for any adult or child right out of the box. This is absolutely revolutionary. And since we have the privilege of buying in 2021/22 instead of a few years ago, you're paying $300 (or less on sale) for a headset that is more capable in every way than the Vive I paid $600 for a few years ago. Compared to the Vive it is lighter, cooler, more comfy, has more naturally ergonomic controllers, and here's the big one: higher pixel density and virtually no screen door effect.You are stealing this device from facebook for $300.

The Quest II is built solidly, if you want a budget VR headset for a child this would be it. It's standalone which means no gaming PC is required but one can be connected should you wish to play SteamVR games.But this is at the cost of requiring a Facebook account for regular use. This is non-negotiable and is an absolute travesty. I have tried out the little loophole method of installing an older Oculus app on the phone but all that resulted in was the VR headset automatically factory resetting after each power down and restart.Go away Zukker.

To put it simply, this headset is great if you want to play supported apps on the device itself. Anything outside of that is luck of the draw. I primarily bought this to pair up with my pc as affordable as it is in comparison to other VR products. My computer is up to spec for VR and I have a USB C cable that transfers 2.5 GB/s. It won't work as they say it will. I have heard through the internet that others have had similar issues as me. Airlink worked for the first day I had it but no longer works either. Tried ensuring my pc and software were as up to date as possible, reinstalling drivers, different cords, reinstalling drivers from device manager, disabling discrete graphics, etc etc. Trust me as a programmer/IT guy I tried a good 8 hours of various troubleshooting but it will not work. Avoid this product if you are buying to use with a PC. Your mileage may vary but I was only able to connect and use it once through airlink and only once at that. Also last I checked their support page is broken so good luck getting into support. Extremely disappointed on the false advertising of how simple and easy it is to use with PC. I'll choose differently next time.

The tech is very good. As many have said head strap changes , battery add ons may enhance your experience. Biggest cons: don’t expect to put this on the market and expect kids to not ask for this, especially if they see it in another household. That is what happened to us.  The lack of timers/ parental controls on like on every other major platform is a major problem. It’s coding a lot of fights to turn it off, and my kids have manage to download inappropriate content despite trying to watch while it is casting on the TV ( the tv doesn’t show someone’s peripheral view and everything they are clicking on)

Intellivision turned me off gaming in the 80’s until the Oculus Quest 2.  All my friends had Atari with a joy stick and red button.  My dad thought I needed to be unique and play with a keypad and circular disk.  6814 pass.  6815 punt.  DAMN IT!  You know how many second down punts I’ve had in my gaming career?!?!  And 6913 drop the ball.  WTH?!  When is that a play you call?!?!Just got an Occulus Quest 2.  This thing is awesome!  Highly recommend it.  WAY better than the Intellivision of 1982.

I stopped buying game consoles when they started the big lie of backward compatibility and prices went insane. I still own my last console a still working NES. I came across the Oculus and read info on it and finally received one for Christmas. What an awesome peice of hardware. I've been having fun doing all sorts of things in it including playing with a little mouse in a game called Moss. There is so much to do even without buying anything besides the Oculus itself!

This headset is terrific. I need to wear glasses most of the time, but this headset works fine without them. The resolution is great for the most part, thought text is a little hard to read if it's further than around 60 centimeters away, and the controllers feel great. I have 3 gripes, however. Firstly, the FOV is quite bad and I often get annoyed by how little I can see with my peripheral vision.On top of this, the headstrap hard to adjust and feels like it might fall off my head at any moment, and moving my head at any significant speed bumps it around and I have to readjust it (on a side note, I would recommend using the top strap to hold it on your head. Don't keep the headset pulled onto your face with the side straps. Those are to stop it moving around).And Finally, there is a lot of light that gets let in at the bottom of the headset and is quite distracting.In conclusion, the software and hardware of the headset itself is almost perfect, but the things surrounding that are less-than-stellar. I'd certainly recommend this headset though, as it is very cheap for what it is and only requires a single cable to connect it to your PC if you want to use Link. On a sidenote of using Link, don't use the cables on your case. Use the ones on your MOBO. This stopped my link from constantly crashing and reconnecting.

You should, you must experience the VR !!!And Oculus Quest is the cheapest way, i think... Its own games are great, but you can also buy the same games from Steam Store and download into the console. Yes it like a console, and another great thing is, it is standalone, you don't need any cables or something else.When you want to connect to PC, you can establish a connection with Airlink. It's also wireless!! But the disadvantage is Airlink drains the battery very well, like drinking it :)I've tried the Euro Truck Sim with a beta VR uptade and I'm shocked... Because when you watch the VR videos on YouTube or similar platforms, you couldn't see the true VR vision, because the monitors draws only 2D views, but in the VR set, there is a 3D modelled view, and it feels also very real.When i played ETS, i feel like i'm in the truck cabin, and i tried to touch the steering wheel :)I recommend every player, it's a great product.

Honestly I've been looking into VR for a long time, and this has to be one of the best ways to enter the VR scene. It performs incredibly well standalone; as well as when connected to a high powered pc. This is the best cheap option for VR that exists.The whole Meta thing is a bit of a bummer, as having to have facebook to use it is a bit rough. But those shortcomings are not something to hesitate over. This thing is WELL worth the money.This isnt high end VR, but thats not what its for. So if you're in the market and are looking for something cheap and easy to use, GET THE META QUEST 2 NOW.

I've toyed around with VR here and there since the late 90s. Prototypes at science centers to the Nintendo virtual boy to cell phone kits to the Oculus rift developer and consumer models. All have been enjoyable, but the virtual boy and cell phone models were too basic, and the prototypes and rift being tethered limited the immersion. Finally, the quest 2 comes along gives a really great experience both as a stand-alone device for more basic games and a wireless pcvr device for the higher end games. Right now it's the best option available for great vr experience. Highly recommend.

I've had so much fun with this thing.  Such a great value.  Hoping the next version has additional cameras for tracking as I play a ton of first person shooters and when you have your trigger hand up where it's supposed to be, the tracking is subpar as there really is only one camera that can see your controller when it's up there by your chin.  So your gun will start moving around without your hand moving.  It's super obnoxious 5% of the time.

What an absolute POS. I solely bought this because I was so thrilled to play resident evil 4. It played it amazing for the first week I had it. Let it sit for about 2 months or so as I had to move and had other things such as work to take care of. Now turning it back on it’s plagued by updates that won’t finish and games that won’t update either. I’ve hard reset it everything you can imagine and it’s still a brick…. Also no way to clear app cache, meaning any game application that you have that it decides it can’t open or play anymore has to be re downloaded and good luck with that. It’s a shame. You’d think a tech giant this big would know better? I guess the moral of my experience is it’s great in the beginning but don’t ever let it sit or it will brick itself with mountains of unnecessary updates that the system can’t recover from.

Disappointed the way this product arrived. Box ripped, parts of item thrown back in box, obviously it was returned and sent back out without the condition of the product even checked. This was bought as a gift for my son and arrived the day before his birthday.  I did give it to him and he says it’s functioning properly, no damage, he had to factory reset it someone else registered the product in there name. If your going to resend returned products to other customers as a new item then inspect the item and make sure that’s the way it’s arriving, it’s a pricey investment to arrive the way it did.

It is actually insane how amazing and futuristic this device is. The surround sound is great, the movements are flawless, the battery lasts long enough. It did make me motion sick (I lived on a boat for 3 months without getting seasick but this got me), I followed a tip and played in smaller increments until I got used to it. Now it doesnt make me sick at all. The headset could be more comfortable but it is not uncomfortable. The lenses get sweat on them because the mask is ""hot."" You dont really feel like its hot but at some point you will notice you are sweating. A good workout but it does make the lenses need to be wiped every so often.Still, five stars. This device could have many more issues and it would still not lose a star. It is so insane for its price, and just as a device in general, it should get 15 stars.

You dont have to use anything else to download content and 128GB lets me play more than 6 games so far.

Pro: The Headset is fantastic and work perfectly. Battery lasts for about 2 hours on a full charge which is more then enough. Love works well on PC with a Link Cable (Even with 3rd party cable). Airlink works somewhat ok, however it is still in beta.Cons: Why does Meta require that I use Facebook to use the headset that I paid for? It is ridiculous that I don't get the option to turn off social settings. I have an Oculus Account, but Meta forces you to merge it to a Facebook account. I would have given this a 5 out of 5, but Facebook can't resist on getting access to personal data. If Facebook got rid of that requirement, this would be the best headset to buy on the market.

This is so much better than PS VR in terms of setup, connection and visual quality. The freedom of movement without any wires and tracking is amazing.AirLink works great, no complaints from me.Battery lifetime is acceptable, but it can discharge pretty quickly just lying there.The ability to view the actual space around you with external cameras is a lifesaver.The stock head strap is abysmal, the headset is practically constantly weighing down on your face, and you need to adjust it every couple of minutes.It's nearly impossible to wear it with glasses, the frame is just not big enough.It has some issues correctly identifying floor level in seated position. And if there is no setting for this in the game, you will view the world as a leprechaun.I don't like the required integration with Facebook, but it is what it is.All in all I'm very happy with the purchase, the device is marvelous for it's price.

For an item that costs $300, I expected more than this. Me and my children played on the oculus for about 5 hours when it needed to be recharged. After charging, it would not detect the left controller. Kept saying that the battery was low, even after replacing the battery. Yes, I was using alkaline AA 1.5v. I tried unpairing and repairing...tried it after keeping the batteries out for 5 minutes. Tried factory resetting the headset. Nothing works. I can only surmise that the controller is faulty. After some searching on the web, I find out that this is a very common issue.Then, when I go to report a problem....""Oh, we'll get back to you in 1 or 2 days."" No number. No live chat.

General opinion: more than satisfiedNegative:- glasses fog up (sometimes)- small screen resolution: the pixels are small, but they are still visible. Need: 2x the resolution- there is no eye tracking function, which is important to create the right focus on the image and for comfort.- if you learn something you need use information for real notices. It is not comfortable.  Transperent mode is bad now, but it's working.- there are few settings and apps yet.Positive:- changing the distance to the text is useful for the eyes- it's a good way to make ideal work environment. You can control visual and auditory stimuli. You can do an ideal room.✅- helm don't allow wrinkle your forehead. It's interesting)- you can use it to get rid your social phobias.✅- there are a lot of experimental function: hand tracking, second transperent mode with augumented reality, attaching mouse, mode with increased frame rate.Need addition tools:Bluetooth keyboard, comfortable helm mountThank you, guys!

I should have done more reasearch on this item, as it is the most inexpensive VR headset it was an attractive buy, however what they don't explicitly tell you is that you need a Facebook account just to open it.  I bought this for my son to use with video games and as he is a child, I was not about to get a facebook account for him to use it.  I also do not have a facebook account as i do not condone spying and collecting personal data.  If I had known the device would be dead in the water without a Facebook account I would not have bought it in the first place.  Buyer beware, the thing collects video feeds of your surroundings and your audio and stores them at facebook (meta). interestingly, they say they have one that doesne't need the account if you pay them an extra $500!!! suspicious.....

The Oculus Quest, it's not bad at all it just isn't what i expected. I could care less about the facebook mandatory connection at all. What I do care about is it's quality. I think the resolution of the product is below average. It is just blurry and I did try the 75 hertz setting but it still sucks. I get way to dizzy after each use and I would feel like puking after even just watching one YouTube video. It also hurts around my head and gives me a headache after I use it. Some games look nice. But some games also lag really badly which I resent. I feel like the games are choppy and get really boring really quickly. I returned it but I haven't got my money back so let's see where that gets me. I'd give the product a 4/10. It just isn't what I hoped for.

My son got one and I fell in love and had to order one myself. I get extremely motion sick and there is many things I can do on it that does not make me nauseous. You have to adjust the eyes perfect or it is blurry. It is very easy to use and fun. The face cover that does come on it though sucks and hurts my face. When you order your headset I would separately order a different face covering. Definitely worth the money!

Works well fun. You will want to buy the upgraded strap for the head. Strap that comes is hard to adjust between people. Bought a case the came with upgraded head strap that uses a knob on the back to tighten and loosen the oculus to your head. Also going to want to get a external battery takes it from 2 hours to 6. Used my cell external in my pocket and a long c cord. But they sell ones that just plug in that are small if you don’t like cords

My kids love this. They are having so much fun playing different games. I like that there are few game options, and we are still exploring other things the VR can do, I'm excited to see some of the ""travel"" type experiences. I got motion sick from some games, but my kids are so far ok. The only drawback is the battery drains rather quickly, so the wait to charge has been challenging for my kids.

If you’re on the fence about getting it and not sure what you’re going to do with it like I was, I suggest you save your money. It’s just an expensive niche toy tbh. Once the hype of having an oculus passed I stopped paying any attention to it. Now it just sits in the box beside my chair. A $350 cup holder. BUT if you have a purpose in mind for using it or think you’d enjoy the limited amount of games currently available then go for it. You won’t be disappointed. Whether you use it or not, it’s definitely cool as sh!t , especially the first time lol

The Headset is a great package for a wonderful VR experience, but a few minor issues put it off a bit for me. Personally, The head strap is a bit odd and doesn't provide a very comfortable experience when playing for long, but some cheap aftermarket accessories can fix that. Additionally, the store is a bit overpriced with some very lenient sales so I personally stuck with steam and the use of air link. Now, Airlink is a great software functionality, it just has many issues such as a weird wide FOV when looking through passthrough as well as plenty of visual glitches and some settings options that are impossible to change. But besides all of my messy criticism, it is a great head seat that will please most and is definitely a great VR experience.

So I bought this for my wife for Christmas, she loves it, it's great for VR Chat and other games.My main complaint, and if you are considering this for PC, definitely check to see if your GPU is supported by oculus. I wish I would have known that it wasn't compatible with the 1650 GPUs, which is weird considering they support the 1060 gou and I believe a few 900 series GPUs.But any way, she really wanted to play her steam games in VR on her computer, but sadly she can not do that.But it runs great as a stand alone unit, and for what apps you can get in the Oculus store, and she still enjoys it.

The Oculus Quest 2 is a revolutionary device that brings VR to the mass market. The competitive pricing plus a wide variety of apps on the oculus store makes Quest2 an all-in-one entertainment powerhouse. However, the device is not well designed for spectacle wearers. Even with the eyeglass spacer provided, it is a pain to fit the eyeglasses into the small headset, not to mention that my eyeglasses keep nudging my nose, making the VR experience very uncomfortable. Fortunately, I bought from VR WAVE a pair of Quest 2 prescription lenses insert which completely solves the problem. I ordered them on the VR WAVE website and the lenses are delivered in a week. VR WAVE tailor made prescription lenses inserts according to my eyes, and the lenses inserts can be attached easily onto the headset with the magnetic design. I no longer have to wear eyeglasses into VR and being “perfect vision” in VR brings the whole experience to another level. I think that Oculus can do better on the headset design as VR is still far from comfortable without the help of these accessories.

I was excited to try this so I bought one. Delivered quickly so great as always. When I opened it up it had a scratch on it (as shown in picture). The battery life of this VR headset is absolutely terrible. It needs to be able to last WAY longer. This headset is also bad for people with glasses. I have to take mine off just to use this even with the glasses insert attached. The last issue I have is being able to fit it on me perfectly to be able to see the screen and not have any blur; the part that hangs on my nose is never centered and always manages to close off my nostril so I’m always having to adjust it.

The Oculus headset offers something for everyone - games, workouts, puzzles, travel, events, social - and this market is just getting started.  Games are affordable (many amazing games are free!) and take up far less memory space than PC/console games.

First time using a VR. My biggest issue is that even though I adjust the straps I get a headache. I have to balance my head back to keep goggles in a place where I can see and not have such a bad headache. I usually use one hand to press up on the nose area of the goggles to have a clear view- and can only do that if it’s a app that doesn’t require both hands. Positives is the experience of VR.

Likes: Very easy setup as long as you have a decent wifi signal. All but the most popular games are relatively inexpensive. VR takes some getting-used-to, especially if you are past 70 but very rewarding with respect to emersion in the game.Cons: Requires a fair amount of empty space in your home if you want to play safely. Battery life, particularly for high-rez, fast action games is rather short.

Honestly, this Headset is pretty nice when you don't have a PC that would be able to run these games. The games arnt huge (with some only being a few gigs) and just are fun to play for hours.The only thing I have to say is if you get this might as well get a better headstrap because that one is just ok for the time being but can really hurt after a while. The battery life is ok aswell depends on what game you chose to play but really you should not play for more then 1-2 hours.When I first started to get into this, I will say after waking up the next day my brain couldn't figure out what was real or not so just keep that in mind. It goes away after a week of use just wish I was warned first.You will love it, your kids will love it, your grandma will love it, I'm 25 years old and thinks this kicks a**.

My son and I both got one if these. After not much time, a month or 2 - the Operating System freezes, crashes, network won’t start, games won’t load, and then randomly it works again for maybe one or two sessions. We have factory reset our headsets twice and that did nothing but lose progress in my games. He can’t even play now because he is locked out his Facebook account (hacked)that he created for the Occulus and Occulus support won’t help him and there is no Facebook support. We are having to go to the Better Business Bureau to get refunds for his purchases or get a Facebook to verify his identity.  But it is fun when it works but lately, everytime I try to play I spend 20 minutes just powering down and restarting the headset until it works or I get frustrated.  I only have 3 games installed instead of all the games I had bough but that too doesn’t help.  Buyer beware, great technology but extremely buggy and if something happens to your Facebook account you will lose ALL of the games you have purchased.

I bought this mainly for PCVR and it performs really well for that even compared to stand alone headsets like the Vive and Index. What really impressed me is the library and performance with native quest titles. The work in progress features with refresh rate and side loading apps gives it even more versatility for app development and testing as well. No one can really compete with the quality and versatility that oculus/meta provides right out of the box with the quest 2. Hate Facebook or love them, they are investing heavily into VR and hopefully that will lead to only positive things.

For me, the Oculus was everything I wanted for a long time. I ended up buying one for Christmas and I love it so much. It had such a good value price that I couldn’t turn it down. It met every expectation that I wanted and I really enjoy using it! Something to keep in mind is that once you buy the headset, it still costs more money to buy games actually inside the headset. Sort of like an Xbox or PlayStation. You pay to get the actual thing, then whatever games you want. I hope this helped, but I definitely recommend.

Near as I can tell, they're exactly the same. Only thing is, I literally spent all day playing his on my day off. Where as with the Meta quest, I feel like I only get maybe 2 hours out of it. Give or take. Maybe I've gone mad but I'm pretty sure the battery life in the Meta quest 2 is way worse than the original oculus quest 2. Why? I have no idea. That being said, it is still an incredible device. And besides the battery life, the only thing I would change right now is steam compatibility. There are many VR games in steam and if you could have the whole steam library on the Quest, it would bring in a lot of users

I set up my Oculus during Christmas and with kids and family members around and everything being non-stop I couldn't remember my password and pin number.  I have requested over 20 times to have an email sent to me via forgot password and not one time have I gotten the email.  Also Oculus told me they don't even see an account for me, yet when I am on the app, which logs me in automatically I can see my username, credit card info, etc.  Customer service is the same ol people who don't know anything and constantly repeat themselves or make 0 sense.

And at first I absolutely love the oculus immersive environments and gameplay among friends until The oculus decided to no longer be able to track the controllers or my hands for that matter and then got stuck in a boot loop. After spending several hours with tech-support for meta-they were unable to resolve my issue so now I have a $300 piece of crap that I can’t even watch YouTube on because it is constantly turning off turning back on and when it does stay on it is in a loop for tracking loss I have done everything from clean the cameras to replace batteries factory resetting I even use my cell phone to look through the camera at the oculus controllers to make sure the IR lights are still working. I am also passed the day that I can return the Amazon so I guess I’m just screwed very disappointed.

Showed up on time with no damage but during setup it requires you to have access to a phone that can run their mobile app. You cant use a pc and ive tried emulating android and running android x86 on my pc with no luck and no friends or family are close enough to help me out with this. The setup looks great and the music is nice too but i cant give this more than 2 stars. EDIT: I got it setup with a friends phone and it wont let me buy any games or apps. I enter my card details and it gives a vague error message i made sure i typed it right and tried on multiple games yet nothing went through not on the website, app, pc app, or in headset store. I looked online and on the forums and Oculus Support was unresponsive. This headset is over rated and a mess I wish I went with valve on this one.

This is the perfect headset to use to get into VR. Easy to set up and use. Fun games and stunning visuals.My only complaint is the price of games. Some of these games are completed in 30 minutes and have zero replay ability but still cost upwards of $20. It’s hard to justify a $40 purchase when I’ll only play the game for 30-45 minutes.I would be glad to see demos, free games, more affordable games. This comes down to a problem of Facebook being what they are(greedy) and developers underestimating costs of development.If I start to see more affordable games. I may come back and change my review.

The Meta Quest is exactly what my title implies. It's exciting when you first get set up and go into your first VR experience. In my case, ""First Steps"". And after playing different genres from Population 1, Cards&Tankards, and Trover Saves the Universe..VR and specifically The Quest 2 is primed to blow up in popularity very soon. The ""Future"" of gaming does comes with some con's though...battery life out of the box leaves a lot to be desired (2 hours of play time), do not expect graphics to blow you away, VR gaming is still relatively new. But seamlessly being able to party up and play video games in this VR viewpoint with friends is where this really shines. If you're a gamer, and haven't bought one yet, you are sorely missing out on a corner of gaming that is slowly becoming a must-have for gamers and casuals alike. Buy one now!

This thing is a good buy for the price, just make sure you have the space for it too.Battery life is always going to be a concern with every mobile platform, but the battery will need to be charged up first time as recommended just like anything else. Afterward sould last a good 8 or more hours.After it will connect to your desktop via cable or air link and works without issue for me.Steam VR is pretty good with it, break in your Quest 2 so you and it can sync.Use the hand control instead of the controller but only if the game supports hand gesture control.Would buy again.

I enjoyed the device while it worked but after 5 days of use the right controller had internal issues where it would spin me in circles without me touching the controller. As a result I decided to send in the controller for repairs. That was on the 12th of January and it is now February 5th. The most I’ve gotten was an email saying sorry. I’ve sent around 10 emails and the response I get is that the specialist team is working on it. I don’t understand the difficulty replacing a controller but I’ve been unable to use my headset for close to a month now. I’m very disappointed with the support on this device.

She'll play little time waster games on her phone, but that's about it. Now that we have the Quest she's fully into it. In the time we've had the Quest she's probably bought 4 or 5 games for it.

Absolutely love this gaming system. It's been a hit with the whole family and even allows us to play with family and friends that don't live with us. My only complaint would be the battery doesn't last as long as I'd expect. It lasts about 2- 2 1/2 hours which if only one person is playing that's probably more then enough time. But if you're taking turns with the whole family it's not really long enough. That being said it was still worth the money and we love it.

I tried a friend's pair before buying these, and they work just like I had hoped. All of the Oculus apps and games run smoothly over wifi even in an apartment. However, make sure you buy the cord to connect to your pc for if you plan on playing SteamVR games. My experience is because I live around others (i.e., I live in an apartment) and I am running my pc on wifi with the Oculus on wifi at the same time; running both on wifi is unmanagable due to sever lag and locking up completely. However, pc on wifi with oculus on cable works just fine with moments of barely noticeable delay. Also, consider getting a more comfortable head strap with an extra battery pack if you plan on playing longer than 2 hours per session.

The headset itself is great. I have had no issues with anything except for the comfort. I immediately ordered a replacement strap for the headset as i cannot wear it for more than 20 minutes without getting a headache. The head strap is thin and has big hard pieces jabbing into your head. Oculus offers a replacement strap, but it is $50 MSRP and from what I have heard it isn’t even good quality, with multiple people reporting it breaking after little use. Overall, I recommend the headset, but it is (to me at least) necessary to have a head strap replacement ASAP.

I like it, yknow, it kinda sucks Facebook has a wall on it. But I rarely used my Facebook so It doesn't bother me that much. Keep in mind if you are going to use a link cable and you have a nice pc. Make sure you turn it up to 90hz on the oculus desktop app, it fixed ghosting for me and made it really smooth. Also I recommend buying a new headstrap, I didn't use the oculus one I got a KIWI brand head strap. I highly advise newcomers to the vr space to do research on this thing, it definitely  helps you understand it more. So a 4 just because the setup itself was annoying and the headstrap it comes with is pretty bad, and facebook. But a good value overall.

The only choice if you want to try out VR for the first time. The resolution is great, super easy to use, Air Link works fine, so you can play AAA titles like Half-Life Alyx, WIRELESSLY. The original strap is not that good though, I'd say it's pretty uncomfortable. People say playing with glasses is impossible, but in my case I didn't have any issues, the glass spacer does its job well (I'm still going to buy contact lenses, and highly recommend you doing the same, if you have really bad vision like I do). If you hate Facebook, there is Oculess, but I'm ok with it and don't care that much.For Russians and other europeans, buying an adapter from American type plug is VITAL, because you just wouldn't able to charge the headset.In conclusion, I think it's the best headset on the market so far, consider buying it, if you want to get into the VR world as a newcomer.

So when I saw this and the reviews were so good I decided to try again.  He absolutely loves it and now I get 1 hour of quiet time every evening.  Thank you Oculus.

I bought the oculus for best saber and other cool games. I spent $200 on new games and the glitch in the system deleted my profule and games. Tried talking to customer service they said wait for an email. Been almost 2 weeks, no emails, no fixed oculus account. They won't give me a refund for the games I bought. I would not recommend this gaming system, until all the bugs are worked out. Otherwose you could end up like me or some of my other family that have experienced this. Yes they do know about the deleting of profiles and apps. So all they will tell you to do is wait.

After 3 months I do not like this thing. Oculus 2 is a cool idea and it's a good start on the VR experience.  The interface needs help, the hardware is very early stage, and the overall experience is cute.  I think I spend more time futzing with the fit of my headset or trying to get the focus right or moving around to adjust the perspective.

At first it seems really cool, but after awhile the bad outweighs the good.  Constantly crashes, disconnects and image shakes.  Requires fb account to use, goodbye privacy.  App communicates with fb in background even when headset not in use and even if not signed into fb, cannot turn this off.  Hard to setup so that focus is consistent.  Frequently loses tracking and requires constant resetting of guardian.  Cannot transfer stored files to PC or other storage media, even when connected to PC.

We were skeptical about this since it doesn’t hook to a computer like the one my oldest so has, but we didn’t want to sink the money into a computer powerful enough to run that Oculus  for my 14 year old.

This product said that it would be shipped in a new condition but I can say with 100% confidence that it was not new. The box it came it said ""Oculus Quest 2"" which wasn't too surprising at first but then I realized that at the time of me buying the product that it should've said ""Meta Quest 2"" instead. Also when I opened the box one of the controllers had a smudge on the top of it. And after less than a month of me buying the product it just breaks, every time I turn it one the entire screen turns into whatever color the majority of the screen is making it almost impossible to play anything. I did not drop it or hit it on anything and made sure to take extra good care of it since this was one of my most expensive purchases.

We have stupid and strange rules in Ukraine about packages. I don't know how it works but I had to pay 25% more for the Quest 2 for getting it (around $75). I was shocked because I have never paid that 25% before when I order import goods. I wanted to request a refund but Amazon decided to help me and they paid that 25% instead of me. I appreciate it. The Headset is awesome. Anyway you have to buy a good wifi 6 router for around $100 and some accessories like swords for Beat Saber, another strap, etc. So get ready to pay more than $300. Btw at first I wanted to play using Oculus Link but my AsRock z370 Extreme 4 motherboard doesn't have any type-c drivers lol. After that I decided to buy a wifi 6 router and I wasn't disappointed. Air Link has an awesome quality and low latency. Thank you Amazon for the Headset and help.

This is second breath after my PSVR. Very useful that it can be standalone and great to play with no wires. Will work something around two hours with no charge, which is pretty solid (considering my avg session time 1:30-2:00).Very recommended to buy a halo strap as helmet does not distribute weight on your head in the best way.The only thing I didn't like is that silicon mask cover is a bit bigger that it should be and there is folds  because of it. Anyway it doesn't bother me physically. Just need to place it correctly sometimes before wearing.

I'm a VR user since 2014 with the Oculus DK2, then I had an Oculus CV1, then an Oculus Rift S, and now a Quest 2. I tried the Quest 2 as standalone, then using AirLink, and lastly using a Cable.I think the Rift S is a better product, just works. If you are going to use the Quest 2 as a standalone is a great great product, but if you want to replace your PC VR, is not.For me, it's a 6.5/10 but if you are new, this could be a 9/10

Frustrating out of the box experience. It would try to boot up but crash and read No command with a little green man on his back with his chest open.  Software glitch on start up had me spending an hour online looking how to get this thing into a set up mode so I could factory rest it. I was 2 seconds away from returning it when it rebooted and actually powered on. I’ll update this if the user experience is extra special but so far I’m just frustrated with a mild headache. Now I wait for it to update..Following day, apart from the set up frustration and very slow updating the headset is something special.  Can’t wait to actually try out the apps and stuff but for now it’s working and kinda cool.

There are so many different things you can do on an Oculus. I love all the worlds you can explore and become fully submerged in. It’s even fun to use to browse apps like Instagram and YouTube. I gave it four stars because when I wear it for more than about five minutes, I start to get a headache, but I’m sure they’re working on making the next gen of Oculus lighter and more user-friendly.

Quest 2 is absolutely amazing! At $300, the 128gb version is a steal for the quality hardware, huge App Store & excellent performance. There’s really no need to buy the 256gb version or any of the accessories. Sure, the games cost extra but there are tons of free games available if you dig!Get off the couch & move around while you game! Several games easily trick you into working out without you even being aware of it… until you’re sweating & winded!No, it’s not the best but the current king of vr, the Valve Index, requires an extremely powerful gaming pc to plug into and is over $1200 just for the hardware. Quest 2 is nearly as good, has an App Store & is standalone (wireless.) Easy choice!

Upon unboxing this item, the screen didn’t work. You could only see about an inch of the display and the rest was complete static. Trying to troubleshoot, we finally were able to get to a screen where we could look around and found that it was logged in to another user’s Facebook account! I’m guessing this user returned the item because of the static issue, and Amazon turned around and resold it to me. I’m shipping this back but it will take close to 2 weeks to receive a replacement.

Bought the Quest 2 for use in the cockpit of MS FlightSim 2020.  It works well for that for sure.  Lots of help on-line to get it setup to work well with the flight simulator.  I also tried several other apps in the Oculus Store and the SideQuest site.  I ultimately found the SuperNatural App to be a great motivator for me to exercise more.  The app promotes full body movement for great workouts  to a great collections of music.  SuperNatural  does require a monthly subscription, but it is much less than a monthly fitness club payment that I probably would only use a couple times a week.

With apps like Virtual Desktop and a good router and connecting to your PC, this easily becomes one of the best PC VR headsets, and the fact it also works stand alone is great. Due to this as well, it can be used wirelessly. Only down side is the not-so-great head strap. You can easily get yourself a 3rd party one that is way better (and cheaper) than the official pro head strap, but that quickly raises the price into the realm of other headsets that come with better head straps out of the box.Just make sure you have plenty of play space and be careful not to hit walls, or low ceilings!

This is my first VR headset, one of my brothers allowed me to try his Oculus headset in a family reunion, and I was blown away. Since that experience, I was sold, and I decided to get one of my own. I have to say, this Oculus quest is way better than TV. I use it whenever I get the chance.  The reason for the 4 stars is due to the battery life; it would be nice if the headset would have a longer battery life, I can roughly get around 2 and 3 hours of play. Other than that, I like it, and I am looking forward to play the games and eventually, use them with Second Life and Sansar VR.

I had some account issues due to a system error on Meta's side. It has also frozen a few times after leaving it idle for a while after using Air Link.But when it works (which is most of the time), it's so easy to set up a boundary and start playing. The pass-through features also work really well to make sure you don't accidentally bump into a pet or toddler.

I've been a pc gamer for many years, and now just got into VR gaming. The Quest 2 is a perfect choice for those who are new to VR gaming.In my opinion, the whole Facebook account thing isn't a big deal. It's just people adding more drama towards this product. You do not have to use your actual FB account. Just make another account for your VR.All in all, this is a great VR period.

I purchased beatsaber and within seconds of loading any song it freezes and is unplayable. I have requested a refund but am told it may take days. Funny how that works, they take my money with no delay, but if I want that same money back 20 minutes later, they need all this time to process it. Considering returning the headset before the amazon return window is up as this is not promising.Another thing to note: If you have glasses, the experience can be rather uncomfortable and negatively affects picture quality.

Don't think about buying this headset. Just do it, like literally. Yeah it's a little expensive but it's well worth it. My children and I tried out a VR headset for the first time at my brother's house and we were in love. When my son asked for this for Christmas, I didn't think twice. It's easy to travel with and share the fun. From my youngest child of 7 all the way to my 60 year old step father, everyone has had an amazing time with this VR headset. Beatsaber is a must buy. The only complaint I've heard so far is that minecraft isn't VR yet. 😂

As far as the device itself, I give 5 stars it is great. But I purchased this because it advertised that it came with a $50 electronic credit versus one that came with a case. This was a gift for a teenager so I thought better to have a credit for games than the case.....after opening it, when I called to ask how to apply the credit, I was told that I was supposed to add some promo code at check out. That is not what was advertised.  There was no promo code to type in! I was asked if I took a screen shot of the offer. Didn't know I should have but do now! I was told there was absolutely nothing they could do. So for the experience,  I rate it 3 stars.

If you're going for a VR headset for pc play, get the HTC Vive; it's more expensive, but it is worth every penny compared to the Quest 2.Facebook(Meta) had the big brained idea of making the link cable port the same as the charging port. Normally this wouldn't be too bad, but the cable that is used is a usb c, a connector that can barely grab into the headset while in use.Functionality, it is far worse than previous oculus headsets (poor controller tracking, front sensors, ect) The only upside to the Quest 2 over say the Rift S, is it's weight; it is far lighter than other headsets. But that is a foot note compared to my problems with the Quest 2

The product itself is awesome, no complaints. It's insanely fun and you will love it. The problem was that I purchased it under the pretense that I would get a $50 Amazon credit upon purchase which has not been the case.  Upon research, it appears that many of us are having this problem and right now especially $50 is a huge deal and could benefit a lot of people to have that at their disposal.  Very disappointed in this aspect of my purchase and had I known I wouldn't have gotten the credit, I might have opted on a different purchase or looked to buy from a different retailer.

HAHAHA it’s been another 16 DAYS since they’ve told me they will send a new headset and I should get the shipping tracking number “shortly” what a scam. Feels like they “stole” my headset.

Great for wireless PCVR as well as the standalone games from oculus. 2 weeks later the right controller started to drift, have to use contact cleaner to fix it. Air link works great, though i had to get a new wifi router (MUST be wifi 6, with high bandwidth). Link cable does look sharper though but the cable is annoying and for most games the wireless is better. It has decent resolution that is very clear (no grid/screen effect). Battery lasts for about 2 hours, with a powerbank attached It goes for way more, ~ 6 hours.Been playing both native and PCVR games and loving it, just the controller drift was annoying

If you had the quest 1 when it came out, like me, you would know it came with a long charger and a nice case that could fit the headset with a external back strap. This one comes with a short charger that you can’t play with and a not high quality case. The new headset also comes with a Velcro’s strap fully unlike the plastic quest 1 strap. This forces you to buy the pro head strap. A case that can fit everything, and a longer connect charger. They are doing this just trying to get more money I feel

Headset is lightweight, easy to use and has a great cordless feature. However you can only purchase games through the oculus store. I dont know if anyone else is having this issue but the Oculus store is broken! It will not allow you to add any form of payment so you can have games to use. Also it still requires you to add a Facebook account to use it! In essence it’s a very nice paperweight and there is NO tech support!

Great headset. I do wish the graphics were just a little sharper (closer to PCVR) but it's no biggie. Only thing I recommend before buying is to have someone to play online with. Solo play/usage is cool but can get boring after a while. It's best as a social device.

I got my oculus on August 25, 2021 and it hasn't even been a year. I've never in my life seen anything like this. It wasn't even on the charger for a long period of time and the oculus was completely melted. I need a replacement cause obviously this is not normal. I've been using this particular charger for over 3 years on my phone and I've charged my phone all night. My oculus might have short circuited or something because this can't be normal. I am super disappointed. 300$ spent on something that hasn't even lasted a year.

Save your money and get a Valve index. This headset is just a cheap money grab by Facebook. As someone whos had VR for a few years now, this headset seems about 4 years behind.Low FOV, low refresh rate, blurry at best resolution, barely able to play most modern titles unless you get a link cable.You can also get an Oculus Rift if you really want to stay in the predatory Facebook ecosystem

Totally immersive environments are amazing, and new stuff is coming out.  The games are next level with total control of items used.  The movies and videos are fun, especially ""adult"" videos.The goggles are a bit heavy and can cause some issues with eye strain until you get used to it.

I would definitely recommend this vr headset for anyone looking to start playing, or had played vr and is looking for a cheaper headset. It can basically play all the games the pc vr's can will being completely portable. With air link or a link cable it can be connected to a pc to play pc only games. I would also recommend buying an elite strap with it as well as the original strap does tend to hurt a bit after a few hours of game time. It can be a third market one like kiwi's. But all in all, its a great headset.

So on Amazon’s part it was very good. Arrived in 3 days. Awesome, but on Oculus’ part is.....pretty bad. Headset is really cool I’m able to get free games. But when it comes to the app and putting in my payment method to buy games it just won’t allow me. And I’m not the only one, hundreds of people are having the same issue with contacting and getting support from oculus. It’s a gamble with this thing in my perspective, risk not being able to put a payment option on the device to buy games or just simply have a good working VR to play games on. It’s very frustrating that I payed $300 for this and can’t even play good games on it.

It is NOT easy to set up because we are stuck on the having no Facebook account. And Facebook is not good on privacy. They sell your info to much.

Streaming high fidelity PC exclusive VR games straight to my headset with virtually no latency is incredible. Hats off to the oculus team.  Love it. If you're going to buy one though just make sure you also get at least a 10-16ft usb C charge cable for long plug as you play sessions, and a different premium head strap for better comfort. And for glasses wearers like myself prescription VR lens from somewhere like VR Wave are the best investment, trust me.

The oculus is an incredible piece of tech. My only issue is how expensive the games are. I completely understand that the game companies need to make money, but there’s a certain level where we should be able to buy the device with one pre installed game, like BeatSaber or Galaxy’s Edge, or whatever, so the Oculus isn’t basically useless until you can buy a game. The games also average from 15-40 dollars, some with add ons even after the initial 40$ price point. My only problem with the Oculus is the game costs.

I can't find anywhere to report the problem or try to access the account. In dialogue with the AI chat, it keeps telling me not to do anything with the account. I am highly frustrated at the lack of customer service and will be checking out other VR platforms in the future if this isn't rectified soon. Meta =MEGA problem.

I was nervous that I wouldn't be able to play VR games from computer, but with airlink I can play them easily, I am playing Boneworks right now and I recommend it. Only problem I have is if someone is using the wifi, then airlink starts to lag, so I usually play it only when I am alone at home. Also while using Airlink, you need to use lan cable on your computer, also you need to be close to your router for a good experience. It also has it's own app store and games too and they don't require any other device like a computer, you can just start your VR headset and play/use them.

Loved the product for its immersive capabilities and image quality, but ultimately had to return due to the severe nausea I experienced every time I used it. I realize I may be a rare case, but important consideration for a $300+ device.

I love the quest 2 and the games that are supported  but it can be better. 1 the battery life is horrible only giving you about 30 minutes of playtime before you have to charge it. 2 if you want to buy a game you need to put in your quest pin and they only show you it once and it's through the quest app so if you forget your pin you have to make a new one. 3 if you leave the quest plugged in for a long period of time the charging port will melt. Do I recommend the quest 2? yes just make sure you have a way around all the problems listed.

Resolution is really bad. All your games will be blurry. I have good hardware, I played HL:Alyx via official cabel - it is bad. Also the most bad thing - the connection to the Oculus servers is always required and it is not stable.  Why do I need connection to Oculus servers for games in my SteamVR, this is really stupid idea. If connection is not stable - your game starts glitching.

The product is very heavy and leaves red marks on my face. The head strap does not fit my head very well have to wear a knit cap to make it work and feel comfortable.  The product could be made better but instead you need pay additional money and buy additional accessories to make it fit and work for you.  This problem also makes it hard to watch and use for long periods of time.

The occlusion was a big item gift that I bought for my son to give to his fiancé.  It is surprisingly good bang dor the buck.  We all enjoy it.  The downside is the dun comes at an even higher price because it is not loaded with any games on it.

I ordered the quest 2 thinking that I could use the $50 credit for purchasing it on accessories like grips and vr covers but they don’t tell you that it’s only for items sold and shipped by Amazon. Guess what, the only items I found from them for the quest 2 are skins and nothing useful for it. The point is the quest 2 is great but don’t get your hopes high about using that credit to further upgrade your device cause you won’t find anything useful from amazon

You need a Facebook (Meta) account to use the oculus. VR is the future. There aren’t many games at this point. However, I suspect that the next few years will bring hundreds of new titles. The graphics are not photorealistic. As the technology develops the games will become I distinguishable from reality. Purchase the oculus 2 now because Facebook is offsetting the actual cost of the technology to get these into as many homes as possible. You will not be disappointed.

Got everything figured out and started it up and everything was working flawlessly until day 2 when it refuses to stay connected, guardian constantly needing to be set over and over. maybe its just me and i'm missing something but setting it up is a nightmare and rather just sit at a computer and play my games instead of playing with it for 10mins and spending 50mins in menus trying to solve a problem. i will live with this mistake as it is my fault.

If you are looking for a cheaper jump into VR the quest is a perfect option. Especially if you use a pc link. But even without that the headset works wonderfully. But be warned, the strap is uncomfortable and the face cushion isn’t the most pleasant. I highly recommend upgrading both just to make wearability better. Also be aware with how the controllers are shaped, you will bonk yourself or other things sometimes. The rings placement just makes that happen.

Esperaba un poco más, son entretenidas y definitivamente recomiendo conseguir algún accesorio que cambien las correas que traen ya que cansan mucho y es incómodo. No es como se ve en video donde se ve todo bien definido y pantalla completa. Realmente ves a través de un círculo prácticamente porque se alcanza a ver las partes negras alrededor. No la compren sin el accesorio para cambiar la correa, cansan bastante. Pero si son entretenidas aún con sus falencias

While the oculus in itself was nice, it requires you to link to a Facebook account. My Facebook account was hacked about a month after I purchased this equipment and since Facebook has zero customer service, I can't get back into that account. This means the oculus is now an expensive piece of useless junk. The oculus customer service tried to help but, apparently, once a Facebook account is linked to the oculus, they can't close it and help you set it up under another account.

As someone who has never tried virtual reality, the quest has opened my eyes to some really fun times. I recommend getting a link cable if you plan on doing PCVR, you’ll need some extremely low latency if you don’t have one. One issue I have is the pressure the standard strap puts on my head. I have to adjust the strap periodically when I play on it because it hurts after a good bit. Otherwise, amazing device!

To be honest, I was hyped all year about the Quest 2 and all the promises and features of the Metaverse, it seems something up my alley.When I got it, something felt really off. The Quest 2 squeezed my glasses, but the old ones fit? It was odd, and I hope the Metaverse team addresses this in future installments, this was a let down. This small issue is for spec wearing people like me isn't spoken much around the VR community, and getting into VR is super expensive.

Gear for the price when compared to other vr sets. The only downside is that Facebook account is required and there is a lack of parental controls so if a kid is using it you have to go into the apps to turn off voice chat or violence settings or whatever else.

I love this!  I was promised $50 in credit for games and didn't receive it.  Not happy about that! But super happy with with product.  It doesn't hold charge long feels like I have to charge it b4 I use it every time and I don't use it much.  Beat Saber is the bomb!  Rec Room sucks and aome other free adventures are cool too.

The Oculus Quest 2 is next level VR when it comes to wireless VR gaming. The native Oculus games also do very well.Downside to the Quest 2 is that the standard strap is very uncomfortable when playing for a long period, buy an Elite Strap or use a counterweight to make it more comfortable.I would highly recommend the Oculus Quest 2.

Also it's cool to play beat saber and five nights at Freddy's. The only thing I don't like is some small buggy glitches or the controllers die really fast

This is a review of the Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 128 GB.I have never used a virtual reality device before and was super eager to try it out. I have heard good things about the Oculus Quest 2 so I was really happy to get one. Happy to say it’s pretty amazing.First of all about me, I am older and although I’m fairly techie, I have never tried VR before. So as soon as I opened the box I was a little intimidated because frankly the instruction pamphlet is not all that great for a novice and the start-up foldout only gets you connected. Following the foldout was easy - now to go on and see what this puppy can do.I immediately went to the Internet and looked up various videos because at least for me, it wasn’t all that intuitive and I was having some trouble figuring out how to use the controls and access the apps and programs I wanted. Once I saw the videos, it was easy.So how do I like it? I have to say it’s pretty amazing. The headset feels okay/comfortable and you can adjust the  lens for clarity - not perfect but fine and doable. It’s easy to set up with one problem I had at the start - the tab to pull out of one of the hand controls ripped which was an issue and we had to struggle to get it out.  Without removing those tabs you cannot operate or connect the Oculus Quest 2. Again, be sure to check out settings and the various options and  check out some of the available fan videos.The only concern I have - and no stars off for this because it’s not the fault of the Oculus Quest 2 - is that it really gave me motion sickness after just 10 minutes and I felt dizzy. I have tried it out several times to no avail - I am prone to migraines and sadly, I won’t be able to use this. I have some issues even watching movies in 3D so this did not come as a great surprise to me. My husband had the same problems I did while using it, although he too was amazed by the graphics and clarity. I did give it to my son who is in 7th heaven so it all worked out great.Lastly - you have to have a Facebook account to use this which was an issue for me because I had closed out my FB account because I didn’t want it. So to use this, I opened another one under my husband’s name with full privacy mode and no other information than his name. That’s one way to get around this I guess but do know you need that FB account.

Incredible clarity; fun and also great for gamers. Just one concern about this for me.

I have tried various VR headsets, from those you have a mobile phone attached to a headset, another is the Oculus Go, which I have had the opportunity to do research for the mental health industry and also train those in the industry on the use and potential of the technology.But today I am testing the recently released 128GB version of the Oculus Quest 2, which was released by Oculus, a brand owned by Facebook.The virtual reality headset was released on October 13, 2020 as a 64GB model priced at $299 and a 128GB model for $399. On August 2021, the 128GB model dropped to $299 and the 256GB model was released for $399.The latest version featured a similar design to the original Quest while lighter in weight, updated specifications, a higher refresh rate and resolution and updated Oculus Touch controllers.So, I wanted to see for myself of how I felt about the technology and its improvements since 2019.The headset comes with a head strap, the two Oculus touch controllers each with a AA battery and a USB-C power adapter.After charging the unit, I went ahead and set my headset to my wireless connection and connected it to my Facebook account.It's important for everyone to know that it is mandatory that you MUST have a Facebook account for this device. The account is profile-based, and you can not set multiple profiles. So, those used to a console such as a PlayStation, XBOX or Nintendo Switch who are used to having multiple profiles, this is not possible. If you have several children, they can either play under your account profile or you will need to purchase each person their own headset.And then can setup your virtual environment from the currently eight offered and then get acquainted with software like First Step (which is an entertaining introduction to the how VR is with the unit and will impress those who never used VR before).You can setup your ""Guardian"" which you can see your space and making a ring around you, to let the unit know how much space you have for gaming, so you don't hit the wall or any thing that you have in your room.But then it's time to check out the apps available.  Most will want to try the free apps offered.  But then I was ready to purchase and test out games from numerous genres.The first game I decided to test out was one game that many people have put high in their ""must-buys"".So, after doing research, I wanted to test out the system completely in the following genres.   For rhythm and dance games: ""Beat Saber"", ""Audio Trip"" and ""Synth Riders"".  And two games from Japan, such as ""Kizuna Ai - Touch the Beat!"" and ""Beat Arena"".For shooter, I decided to try ""Population One"", ""Pistol Whip"", ""Blaston"" and ""Larcenauts"".  For sports, ""Golf 5 eClub"", ""Top Golf with Pro Putt"" and ""ForeVR Bowling"".  For fighting, ""Thrill of the Fight!"", ""Ironlights: Ultimate Update"" and ""Holopoint"".  For adventure, the three episodes of ""Star Wars: Vader Immortal"". For social, I tried VRchat, vTime and AltspaceVR.With the rhythm games, each of the three games provided an entertaining and fun workout.  Featuring cool music and most importantly, companies releasing inexpensive DLC music packs is a plus.    Each have a similarity in choosing skill factor and ability to select different music and go at your own pace.  Have only ten minutes to work out, then dance to three songs.But what I like is the workout aspect.  You are going to dance as you crouch or move to the left and right to avoid barriers.  And the better you get, you can set your skill higher for an even more intense workout.For the two Japanese games, ""Kizuna Ai - Touch the Beat"" is no doubt for the anime fans who want an easier pace and the fact that the makers put on live events (announced on Twitter on FB) to coincide with their device is a plus.  While ""Beat Saber"" allows you to play drums, guitar and bass and strumming or hitting the drum to the beat/symbol.  But I see the potential, for the Japanese market to really capitalize on the growth of VR as many established, may it be anime,RPG or sports games from Japan can be suitable for VR.The golfing on the Oculus Quest 2 is absolutely awesome.  I was surprised of how my swing was actually emulated quite well on the Oculus Quest 2, from driving to putting.  And the fact that you have golf enthusiasts playing and competing is a plus.  While I tested ""Thrill of the Fight!"" and the boxing mechanics were quite awesome.  Again, the workout involved in quick punches, jabs, etc. and the training in the gym, makes for another wonderful reason to get a VR headset.But games such as ""Holopoint"" is one of those games where you will need adequate space.  When purchasing a game on Oculus, you will receive a warning that the game is meant to be played in a larger setting.  Of course, a few people may guesstimate that they have adequate room and may have 5.5 feet when they game asks for 6.5 feet from all sides.  So, please do your due diligence in researching the game and how much space you need.For shooting, this is where I could only do ten minute sessions.  You have to shoot, move, crouch and prepare for intense combat that you are often in motion. If first-person shooters on a console doesn't give you motion sickness (as I play a lot), a shooter on VR is a different story.  You have to think quick, move quick and while ""Pistol Whip"" and ""Blaston"" was easier, I realized that shooting games that require a lot of movement will take awhile for me to get used to.  I tried to do an hour of ""Population One"" and I was nauseous right after and even the morning after.But the first game that made me love gaming on the Oculus Quest 2 was ""Star Wars: Vader Immortal"".  I love how the game was immersive and the first moment when you come into contact with the Empire, what a memorable VR experience.And last but not least, the chats available.  I think that as I partake in the various VR chats, many have adopted life for a few hours in the VR world to be exciting, especially during these times.  The people you meet all around the world and conversations are quite enjoyable most of the time (and yes, like real life, you can see drama especially during the discussion of politics and religion).  But for the most part, the VR social community opens up a new way of communicating much different from ZOOM and for people who have anxiety or feel awkward about their personal appearance, many have said they took up VR for that purpose.So, for the most part, the Oculus Quest 2 has managed to change the lives of many people.It's important to note that I also tested out the Oculus Air Link which allows you to hook up to the your laptop wirelessly, so you can play VR games that are installed on your PC/laptop.  And you'll need to purchase a USB-C link cable for the Oculus Quest 2 separately, if you want to transfer files and also for those who want to run code on their device.  One of the things I do is I record my gameplay and I transfer the video to my computer.And for me, it has changed my life because the inability for me to feel safe working out during this time, I like the fact that I can work out but be entertained.  For nearly two years, I have been working out indoors and to be frank, while things worked out fine for the first few months, I grew tired to the point I stopped working out because it became more routine.  But on VR, you can workout because its more immersive, you can compete solo or with others and be immersed.Unlike a console game, you are working out your muscles through full body movement.But VR also opens the possibilities for many, especially for those who may have a disability, there are games that you can partake in, as long as you can use the controllers or even hand movements and of course, see the visuals.  I also have read about athletes who have been injured and can no longer compete professionally, who have found a second life through VR, they can train and partake in competitions through games.But also for one's mental health for those who want to be more social but are not yet ready to be with a group of people, but are able to do it in the virtual world.  And I like that many mental health clinics have services to provide special programs for those that need help.Now, you probably can tell what I've wrote so far, that I'm quite positive about the headset.  But is it perfect?Now as for the hardware itself, if there is one thing I do miss, while you can add spacers to wear glasses, the Oculus Quest 2 has three settings by moving the Oculus lenses to obtain the narrowest at 58mm, the middle setting at 63mm and the widest at 68mm.  In the past, you can easily choose and  manually set a variety of ranges to suit one's vision, so if you wanted 60mm, you can't do that.I did replace the headset, you can purchase the Oculus Elite headstrap or other similar headstraps that are more padded and a better fit and are easy to adjust.I also replaced the facial interface, because I sweat a lot and so I wanted something that handles sweat much better, but if you have friends over, I can easily switch out foam with replacements, so multiple people can play and I can introduce more people to VR.  I also purchased universal disposable hygiene covers as well.I also added a skin for the headset and the Oculus Touch controllers, more for protection and I don't want staining or my device to get dirty.But I also purchase a special mat for VR gaming, so I know when I'm moving too much and I can tell when I feel the ridge of the mat that I'm moving to far that I may hit the wall, the couch or getting too close to my aquarium. Because while the Guardian on the headset will show you that you are leaving the safe zone, because you are immersed in the game, sometimes you just fail to pay attention and thus, the mat really helped out with gameplay.Overall, I feel that now is the time to get into VR.  The number of people who are becoming VR gamers and also taking part in the VR community, may it be through a social platform, competitive gaming, etc. has grown.It's changed my life to the point that I look forward to donning the headset at the end of a workday and I have to work out and visit the social community later in the evening and communicate with others.  For adults, this is a wonderful, innovative hardware to own that can be a life changer for many.But like any technology, many adults use it for competitive gaming, casual gaming and social chatting.  And as I know many parents will purchase children headsets, thinking it's another pass-the-time gaming, the problem right now is that certain VR social platforms and even certain games will have children who will talk, cuss and there are few who try to ruin one's experience or those who try to be involved in adult conversations where it's not appropriate for them to be part of.But for the most part, owning the Oculus Quest 2 has more positives than negatives.The Oculus Quest 2 is fantastic, and while not perfect, the improvement in VR technology these last few years and the growing number of things one can do in VR makes the Oculus Quest 2 one of the best investments one can make for 2021.Highly recommended!

I now own 2 Quest 2's, though one I immediately gifted. I got my first in November of 2020, and ever since have enjoyed it immensely. It's not just a gaming headset, it's a media device, it's a relaxation tool, a workout device, and of course a solid gaming headset. There's more to it than just playing games, which is why I can recommend it to so many kinds of people. Let me explain why that is.The Quest 2 is first off, a lighthouse free device. No set-up of little boxes to see the headset in the corners of the room or on the ceiling. It uses Cameras on the headset, and a virtual boundary that you draw when you start up the headset. You do have to confirm the boundary or re-draw it every time you turn it off and back on all the way, not just let it sleep, but that's a minor issue. Tracking is not as solid as a lighthouse VR like a Steam Index, HTC Vive, Etc. but very usable. There are times where it's a problem, mainly sniping in games like Hotdog's Horseshoe's and Handgrenades, but that's a minor issue. Plus many slight imperfections in tracking are being accounted for by game developers such as Anton of H3VR to make the experience with Camera tracking better for more precision with less precise tracking methods.The media playing of the Quest 2 is very good. You can pull up 3 browser screens at once surrounding you in normal Quest mode with tabs open in each one outside of the active tab. I've had no issues related to compatibility between the Quest 2 Browser and any site, especially when you can request the Mobile or Desktop version of the site if it doesn't work on one. I have not tried putting files directly onto the Quest 2 for playback, so I can't speak on that. The screen on the Quest 2 is very crisp (though not 4K by any means) to where I don't have any issue watching a movie on it with the normal resolution.Comfort wise, I think this is one of the main drawbacks of the Quest 2. The stock strap is good, I used mine for a long period, and still go back to it for certain use scenarios. However, it's not as secure as I want for movement intensive games like Beat saber, even if it won't fall off. Ever since replacing the strap, I've had less headaches with the Quest 2. It also can strain the eyes, but I personally have less issues with that than most. I've played on a Quest 2 for 10 hours straight, and my eyes felt slightly bothered. Not saying everyone can do that. They also recently added a Silicone cover to all Quest 2's or the ability to request one for your Quest 2, which feels much better than the foam alone. The foam to me felt like sandpaper after only a short period, and that cover feels like what it should have been before. Some people will have issues with the Quest 2 using a 3 position IPD, which will change how well you see the lenses. It's a ""three sizes fit most"" type solution to IPD adjustments. Some people will fall outside of the range of the IPD, or even in the right range won't be perfect, but I've had no issues in the default 2 position it is shipped in. It's also easy to set that position, just slide the lens left or right. Controllers feel good, and should fit most hands, they also only use 1 AA each and last for over 10 hours easily.For gaming, there's 2 different answers to how well it does. I'm breaking it up into two sections as a result. If you're not planning on using your Quest 2 for gaming, please skip this entire section.By itself: The Quest 2 is solid, though it has many limitations. It is not a replacement for a gaming computer, but it can operate many games completely stand alone. SuperHOT VR is one I personally play only on the Quest 2 by itself, and it's been out a moment. You can get many solo VR games on the Quest 2 app store, but some will have graphical downgrades over the PC versions. One example of a game doing this is Onward, a Military Sim shooter, which had to be graphically downgraded on Quest 2's to be compatible to play on the system, but still be capable of playing with true PC players. Many may also look to play VRchat on the system, while I recommend the experience, Quest users on the game are unable to see PC avatars or go to PC worlds, which is a shame. Understand that by itself, the Quest 2 is limited somewhat by it's capabilities, but many developers are designing their games around it, or for compatibility with it. It will be a good amount of time before the Quest 2 becomes an unsupported standalone system.Oculus Link: While the Quest 2 has problems running many games by itself, or have to be downgraded to deal with the processing power, it doesn't have to stay that way. Oculus and aftermarket companies have Oculus Link cables which are USB-C charging cables that are designed for high data transfer rates for a smooth experience. They are also intended to connect your computer to the headset, to use the computer's processing power to play games, rather than the Quest's. As a result, this allows you to play all PC VR games on the Quest 2. However, this hinges on your computer being able to run VR games at all, and at a smooth enough rate to make it a worthwhile experience. VR ready PC's are not cheap, but if you're already trying to play the latest intensive games at high resolution, your hardware already is likely up to the task to play in VR. Even some less powerful PC setups can be fixed to make the experience better, rendering then upscaling to the desired resolution, or other methods. This can make a game much more smooth, less taxing on the hardware running it, and more enjoyable. What you will need to run the games is far beyond the scope of this review, and you may want to consult someone who knows about computers to ask if your setup is powerful enough to run VR. Also, the Link cable needs to be secure, one tip I have is to use a strap, usually included with VR cables, and strap it to the side of the headset neat where the charge port is. This will keep the cord from dangling straight down and occasionally disconnecting the link. Also with the stock strap, run the cable through the middle of the headstrap, then to the charge port then use the individual strap, so the cable runs down your back, not your side, helps to keep you from being twisted up. One other downside is the Link does still use battery life with many setups due to the power being sent to your headset being lower than the usage, still can get many hours of play at full charge, and able to go again the next day for just as long. I don't know much about using Air Link or Virtual Desktop for wireless Link connections so, I can't comment. I tried, it didn't work very smoothly for me.Final conclusion or a TLDR: This headset is likely one of the best headsets for entering VR, for any reason. Watching movies on a big giant virtual screen can never get old to me, or meeting friends ""face to face"" on a game using the Link function, or hitting blocks that fly past me to a song's rhythm in beat saber to exercise a little in doors, whatever I use it for, it works, and well. It isn't the best VR headset out there, but it is the current best Standalone VR headset to date. Capacity wise, 128 GB is fine, but with too many games, you may run into storage problems, but seeing how everything on the Headset is digital, things are easily deleted and re-installed as needed. Resolution is nice, comfort is acceptable with some issues but minor, and the quality of the build is good. At no point have I ever thought I wasted my money on this, if anything, I wish I had gotten it sooner. Oh one other feature I want to mention is that due to it using cameras to see the outside world for tracking purposes, you can also look outside of VR without ever taking off the headset. Through passthrough, you can see the outside world in Black and White. Very handy feature that I believe all headsets after this one need to include. For the price, this is an easy sell, highly recommend buying this headset, and going from there. If you're looking for the best of the best VR PC headset, this isn't that, but it is a great entry level PC headset, that won't steer you wrong. Mine hasn't let me down, and shows no signs that it will.

A great headset, made better by increased capacity for no additional cost over the old 64GB model.

This is awesome. Take your gaming up a level with this! I promise, you've never used anything like it and you aren't even going to want to go back to traditional gaming systems. It's perfect for adults and kids. My 9 year old and 5 year old have no problems using it.There's a ton of games to buy and you can even watch movies!This comes already charged but you'll want to charge it as you set it up and it updates. Then, you log into your internet and Facebook and you're ready to go.The only downside is that you have to connect it to a Facebook account. I don't really like that aspect but because this is so much fun and so easy to use, I won't take off any stars.They are always uploading more games and the app is easy to use and navigate.You can also get a Chromecast so that everyone can watch what you're doing on the TV, which definitely ups the experience.

The Oculus Quest 2 is undoubtedly the best entry into VR for the price of $299. You get a sharp display and powerful enough hardware to be truly immersed. The headset doesn't require a PC so you can take it anywhere with you. It's like carrying a 80in TV with you wherever you go. There is a ton of content to keep you entertained for days. My main uses are watching my shows on the Oculus while my wife is watching her shows on the TV and gaming through Steam VR. There is a new silicone wrap for the headset included in the box to address the issues that people were having with the foam around the headset.TECH- The basic set comes with the Quest 2 headset and 2 hand controllers- The screen is sharp with 1832 x 1920 resolution per eye. You can still see the ""screen door"" effect but it is minimal.- 72 Hz default refresh rate but can be set all the way up to 120Hz. The downside is higher power usage and faster battery drain.- USB-C port on side to connect to PC through Oculus Link to access SteamVR- AirLink feature works well if you have a WIFI6 5GHz with a solid connectionERGONOMICS- The headset itself is front-heavy. You can adjust the horizontal strap to get a tighter fit and the vertical strap to align the headset to your eyes. I didn't get tired of wearing the headset but it does fog up on occasion when you engage in strenuous activity.- The controllers are lightweight and comfortable. The buttons are ergonomically positioned and very responsive. The tracking was near instantaneous, never once did I feel a lag.APP STORE- Many VR apps and games, but you will need to hook up Oculus Link to gain access to what I consider the premier titles on SteamVR.- Netflix, Amazon, Youtube, Showtime, ESPN, MLB are represented here. The majority of these apps are just ""theater"" apps, where you are sitting on a couch and there is a screen in front of you where you can sometimes change the size. More content providers need to get their wares on this store, there should be no excuses.PROS- Price is $299 for 128GB and entry into the world of VR. Nothing else comes close to the Quest 2 specs and price.- Very portable entertainment center to take anywhere with you. Effectively replaces a game console, a large screen television and your streaming device.- You can use your hands in place of controllers, the gestures are intuitive but the hand tracking needs a little more work to be more accurate.CONS- Facebook requirement is a deal-breaking decision for some. Having an Oculus account serves the same social networking purpose to link users but Facebook wants to tap into your entire social network. Luckily you can set your privacy settings now, but for how long is anyone's guess.- Missing many apps in its ecosystem to make this a no-brainer purchase.- Requires Oculus Link and high end PC to tap into the best titles in VR gaming- Eyeglass wearers might find the headset to be restricting

I've had the Oculus Quest 2 for a couple months now, and I really like what I've seen. It offers a highly immersive and fun little escape. I'm not much of a gamer anymore, so I haven't played any of the hardcore games that the Oculus Quest 2 offers. But what I have done, is play A LOT of the PokerStars VR game! That game is free and a lot of fun.Some drawbacks that I've ran into with this system is that it's directly linked to your facebook account. Without an account, you can't do anything. Also, when facebook's servers went down a few weeks ago, the Oculus Quest 2 went down with it. There's the battery life too, which isn't that great. Usually after 1-2 hours of gameplay, the Oculus Quest 2 needs to be charged. Lastly, my wife can not use this system because only after a few minutes it will cause her to experience nausea, so just a heads up with that!All and all, I really like this console and even though I haven't used it to it's fullest potential, I can definitely see myself playing this thing for quite a while. I also believe that the tech will be a game changer in the future.

I had tried a friend's Oculus Quest a couple of years ago and was really excited about the opportunity to own one myself. While we can geek out on all the capabilities, processing speed, and resolution the magical part is that quickly after putting on the headset your brain takes over and you just accept the new reality. That said, these really are a pretty amazing piece of hardware with essentially a whole computer you can wear on your head.FaceBook did a keynote not long ago where they talked about the fact that they are doubling down on virtual reality as a key part of the ""metaverse"". The good news is that if there was any question about if Oculus was going to have support from FaceBook their parent company they have made it clear that under the new company name ""Meta"", Virtual Reality is a big part of their vision. They also answered some questions about the future or the product with some ideas like at a future date you will be able to use Oculus without a Facebook account and you'll be able to separate your business virtual reality from your personal one.For playing games, the Quest is an amazingly immersive experience and I love that it is active. I regularly build up a sweat playing games on the Quest.The one experience I feel like the Quest isn't quite there yet is media consumption. It is awesome that there are apps like Hulu and Netflix on Quest and the idea of having a virtual screen the size of a movie theater is incredible. If you are in a situation where you don't have access to a TV, it would be a great way to consume media. For most people, it is likely that they are using their Quest in the same room as their television and you'll have a better picture just watching your TV than using the quest.Overall very happy with the ""Oculus Quest 2 — Advanced All-In-One Virtual Reality Headset — 128 GB"". It is a great experience and definitely the future of not just gaming but many asp[ects of life.

If you've never tried VR before THIS is the way to start!The Quest 2 is an amazing addition to the library of VR options available these days. First off the device itselfIts VERY lightweight! When I got the box I was curious if it actually had a VR unit in it. It did obviously! The device is very modest in size and weight. Don't let that fool you, this is a very powerful machineSetup is quite easy. Most will require an update and depending your internet this could take awhile. Also be aware there is a required facebook account (which is obviously free) which some complain about but personally I don't see why all the gripe since its a device designed by facebook.There are several options of customizations for this. From straps to face covers etc, making you're quest easily able to fit your needs.Graphics are superb, competing with high end very expensive units. The resolution and refresh rate is even better than some high end pc VR units!Best part is the quest 2 can easily run WITH your PC. An excellent feature enabling you to (with some additional software) play games that are PC based, ON your quest 2 with the higher refresh rates. THIS is awesome because with again, the right software you can play wirelessly, making VR VERY immersive!Given this DOES require a high end PC and wifi connection.Gaming library is expanding nearly everyday! Some games are just gimicky like alot of vr titles these days but several high end games are coming out. I wont mention any but they are easily researchable , and strongly suggest checking out the libraries available.Battery life is 'ok' at roughly 2 hrs of gaming, but several options available allow increasing that, from battery pack addons to corded play.Durability is okay, just obviously don't treat it rough cause it IS a high tech machine.Onboard sensors are the best part for you don't need any external sensory devices like other VR devices out there so its purely a true standalone device. Easy to just pick up and play at your convenience.Also built in with a guardian feature which allows you to set boundaries preventing you from destroying furniture and or things like your TV depending where you play LOL.The controllers are VERY comfortable! And the battery life is amazingly epic. The power stayed at 100% for days of playing before it started dropping. Compared to other devices which batteries may last a few days I could see these puppies lasting weeks if not longer. They are very sensitive controllers and the quest 2 now features 'hand recognition' so with some apps and games you don't even need controllers!If you never have tried VR I strongly suggest starting with this hardware. Its not very expensive but very high end on the spectrum, and it will be a good investment assuming you are into gaming and VR gaming.Seriously check this out if interested in VR. Whether new or looking to check out new hardware, totally worth it and one of the best priced hardware's I've seen.

This is the new Oculus Quest 2, which is basically exactly the same as the older Quest except that it comes with half the memory, 128Gb of inbuilt storage rather than 256Gb and is priced $100 cheaper than the 256Gb version.The Quest 2 is the perfect entry level headset to find out whether or not you like the VR world.  Some people don't  like VR for various reasons including vertigo and the feeling of getting sick, neck pain as the headsets are fairly heavy on your head etc.  Other people love it and spend hours on it.For your money your will get the headset itself, a fairly comfortable elastic strap to attach it to your head, two controllers and a charging cable.  Setup is fairly simple. You connect it to your phone using bluetooth and just follow the prompts.  You will need a Facebook account to tie it to and this puts some people off (I understand why) but the majority of people already have a facebook account anyway.The Quest 2 has 2 1832x1920 LCD screens. Not quite 4K but a higher resolution than HD.  For the money this isn't bad, especially considering the higher resolution Rift S is double the price.  The eye pieces are slightly adjustable to 3 different positions, dependent upon the size of your head and space between your eyes.  One great thing about the LCD display is that you can adjust the frame rate.  I have mine set to 72Hz which I feel is much smoother than default 60Hz setting and this makes me much less prone to feeling sick.  There is also a 90Hz refresh rate however for PC gaming that is too high unless you have a seriously beefy graphics card.  Note however that you do not need a PC to use this.The headset also has 3D capable audio built directly into the headset.  The sound quality is OK but nothing outstanding. As such a lot of people also wear headphones when using the Quest 2 and there is a built in 3.5mm audio port to hook your headphones into.  Personally, the sound is good enough for me and I prefer using it without the added weight of a pair of headphones.The headset is quite heavy and although the soft elastic strap that comes with it is adequate, I would highly recommend purchasing one of the Elite, hard backed straps that you can find on amazon. These do make a lot of difference in distributing the weight, making wearing the headset much more comfortable and you can wear it for longer.The Quest 2 has hundreds of apps and games available for it, from watching netflix and shooting games to fitness and boxing games.  Even games such as boxing do help you to get in shape as you quickly find yourself ducking and weaving as well as throwing punches as you get immersed in the gameplay.  These games are stored in the 128Gb of memory in the headset and aren't that large so even with 128Gb you should have plenty of room for a number of games and apps.You can also attach your headset to your PC and play VR games on your PC.  To do this you will need to buy an Oculus cable. The official one comes in at $80 which is very pricey.  You can find third party cables that do the exact same thing for much less.  I love to play DCS and Flight Simulator 2020 on my PC with the Quest.  The immersion takes it to a whole other level, however in order to do so you will also need a fairly beefy PC to handle the graphics.  My PC is a couple of years old, so its not powerful enough to turn up all the textures in Flight Sim to Ultra, but it is good enough to play with reasonably high definition.  Honestly this is the main use I have for the Quest 2.  At somepoint I will probably upgrade to the Rift S, but a new PC is in order before that.So if your interested in dabbling with VR or don't have the budget to buy the Rift S then I would highly recommend the Quest 2.  This 128Gb version, coming in at just $300 is well worth the money and I very highly recommend it.

I have been playing with this for a little less than three weeks now (so that I could deliver the most thorough and accurate review possible). And, overall, I am really pleased. Now, this is not my first experience with the Oculus: I did have the first gen one. And, a lot has changed for the better (which is truly impressive).Foremost, this is way lighter than the first gen Oculus (which is great). And, the battery here has a longer life as well (which means more play-time without a break for a charge ... and I love that).Now, unlike the first version, the ""focus range"" here has preset numbers instead of the range that was available in the first gen. So, there are larger increments which may mean very slightly less overall clarity.This is truly so much more comfortable than the first gen version. The first one was very front-heavy (which we would sometimes counterbalance with a little weight on the back). Here, you don't need any mods at all: it has great balance. (And that is the absolute best!)Overall, this has great hand-tracking which allows you to operate the Oculus without any controllers at all. And, that will always amaze me!Beat Saber looks great, the game is great, and there is even a 360 mode which this Quest excels at (since there are no wires unlike the Valve Index).Likewise, there are so many free videos that you can enjoy! So, much can be watched without further investment of money (which is great for those with kids who are always seeking something new). And, many of these freebies are educational: you can learn about history, take tours of various landmarks, explore overhead views of cities, etc. You can even have a 360 experience on the moon! It's very cool!You can add Oculus friends and play games with them (which is really great for those who are maintaining their ""personal bubbles"" right now). Love that!In sum, it is 100% worth upgrading from the first gen version to this one. It's a fantastic starting point for VR! Very highly recommended!

As I've already been enjoying virtual reality games and apps since 2019 with my Oculus Rift S headset, picking up the Oculus Quest 2 was a no-brainer for me. Unlike the Rift S, which requires a wired connection to a beefy gaming PC, the Quest 2 has no such requirements and all I needed was my smartphone to set up the Quest 2 and quickly get started playing. Yay to no more twisted and tangled up wire that I have to unwind once in a while to remove the annoying kinks. 👍As a result of being freed from wires, I can enjoy my games in more environments and I no longer have to pack as much stuff when taking it to friends' houses; carrying a 10-lb gaming laptop and its heavy charger is no fun.Being free from a powered PC, of course, means a shorter continuous playtime since you're limited by the built-in battery size and life. There is a way, however, to extend your playtime through a device such as the 
X-super Home Adjustable Elite Strap with Battery Bracket
 - by strapping on a powerbank to the strap, game time can be extended for a couple more hours. Such a setup adds some weight but I consider it a worthy trade-off.My favorite VR game is Beat Saber and I was disappointed to find out that I had to purchase it again ($29.99). Due to the great exercise it offers, though, I purchased the game again, and playing it on the Quest 2 is just as fun and accurate as playing on the Rift S.Unlike my Rift S, the Quest 2 came with a silicone cover inside the box which was a pleasant surprise.Just like the Rift S, the speakers on the Quest 2 are so-so. I recommend watching shows & playing games with some quality headphones jacked in to up the feeling of immersiveness.At $299.00 (as of 2021-09-15), the Quest 2 is priced like a regular game console (e.g., Nintendo Switch) and I think it's fairly priced for all the high-tech VR you can experience and a library of quality and fun titles that are available. It's a 5-Star Win!

I have heard a lot about virtual reality devices but never got a chance to experience what VR was and decided to give the Oculus Quest 2 a try.The device itself is nicely made but very intriguing. It is a pretty big unit that sits right in front of the eye, it is not too heavy but definitely carries some weight but is tightly secured thanks to the strap.The set up was quite easy as all I had to do was download an app on the phone which then communicate with the Oculus.I get motion sick very easily and was a bit worried I would not last long with the device but the library of apps and games is extensive and contains many options that are not zero gravity and are ground based.I started with the virtual visits of places around the world and I have to admit that it was an amazing experience as I felt that I was really visiting the country. I also tried a few games and it is definitely a huge difference over the console games I am used to as it really made me feel that I was inside the game.All in all, I have to say that I found the Oculus fantastic, I never thought that it would be this realistic.  I am glad I finally got a chance to own one and it goes with say that the Oculus Quest 2 gets a perfect rating from me.

I honestly didn't know if I'd even like VR, but the Oculus Quest 2 and the game Beat Saber (which you need to purchase separately) changed all that. I never thought of VR as an ideal place to get a workout. Beat Saber, which is a must purchase for the Oculus, gets my blood flowing and body sweating more than working out at the gym. The headset comes with an optional silicone covering which is very helpful as I can't believe just how much I sweat using this thing. I also purchased The Thrill of The Fight, which is one of the toughest and best boxing games i've ever played. Beyond games, I've enjoyed exploring VR worlds on AtlspaceVR, Facebook's Horizon's and VR Chat.I really like how the Oculus Quest 2 defines the playspace, there are options for both a fixed guardian and a custom guardian so you can define your play space. They also have the option of adding your couch and computer, so you can add both into your home VR Space.The Quest 2 has held up pretty well with one notable exception, the wrist straps aren't awesome. This can be easily remedied with an aftermarket controller wrap, which can add a much helpful ant-throw palm strap, which I greatly prefer.

I'm Surprised At How Much I Love The Oculus Quest 2

I love new technologies and it's been awhile since I've been watching VR tech.I've tried the original Quest from a friend and I was impressed with the immersive experience you get whether you're watching or gaming.Now with this Quest 2, the resolution is simply much better magnifying the immersive experience one gets on a VR headsetSetupI'm wearing a glass but I found that I don't need to wear one to use the Quest 2. My friend who wears a glass said it's still comfy to him while wearing the set.Initial setup is pretty easy. The 2 controllers are already connected and it asks to adjust the lens as needed.Account sign on - Many people (including me) are turned off of the way Oculus requires an FB account to log in. For me and I think for most, it's a privacy issue and FB is not that known to be an advocate of that. What I did, is I created a separate fresh FB account and that's what I used to log in to Quest 2. So far so good.Here's my favorite games that I play: • Super Hot • Beat Saber • Eleven Table Tennis • Vader Immortal 1-3I occasionally browse youtube VR contents, watch Netflix, HBO Max moviesWatching Youtube in VR is a different level of experience.Optionally, you have an option to connect this to a VR-ready PC to take advantage of the vast PCVR games only available to PCs.This allows you to play much more selection of games via PC. There are 2 ways to connect, one is wired via Oculus Link cable (purchased separately) and another is wirelessly through Virtual Desktop app from Oculus store. There's a number of sites discussing the how and the requirements, just google or search Youtube.I'm able to play Star Wars Squadrons, Half Life: Alyx, Powerbeats.In case you're not aware of the news that some users reported having a rash, the box already came with Quest 2 silicone cover. I've read in the news that the incidents only happen to a very small percentage and I personally have no issue using the default face plate and I've used it for like 30mins or so per session.In my opinion, it's kinda icky to use the default face plate if you're trying to use it for extended sessions especially with games like BeatSaber or Powerbeats where you'll be sweating a lot. The default one is made of I think high quality foam that can absorb sweat. I end up using the included rubber face plate that's easy to wipe with water/alcohol every after session for better hygiene.Mixed reality VRI've discovered this awesome feature just recently. It means you can put yourself inside a game and it doesn't need a green screen! There are more and more games being added. You can search Liv and mixed reality in Youtube for the how to videos.Overall I'm happy with Oculus Quest 2. Technologies change every time and I think it's the right time to jump on experiencing VR whether for workout, gaming, watching movies, explore different places virtually. Life is short. The immersive experience is just worth it. =)

Its really really fun.  Tough to get set up because you need a facebook account to get an oculus account to get the occulus app to get the...next...next...next.  But, once it is going, its addictive, unless it makes you motion sick, which is very possible.  I was blown away by the graphics, expecting pixelated stuff from years ago, but nope.  I got the VR Hot game, and its a good workout, just make room so you dont accidentally punch people.  The game Moss was amazing, kinda short, but great and you can play it sitting down.  For the kids, Acron!  OMG its so fun.  Because the littel kids hands cant reach all the triggers at once, most games are difficult, but Acron only needs the one trigger button, so we all take turns, and it is co-op with everyone else who can use the cell phone or tablet app.  If you have kids 6 and up, I strongly suggest that one.  Battery life is pretty good, but get a back up stand alone battery for long runs if you dont want to be tethered to the charger.  Fits nice and feels good on the head.  Dont use the rubber 'eyeglasses' thing unless you need to, it locks in moisture and can fog things up and heat them up.  All in all, efverything you need is in the nice box, you can even store it in there, its that nice.  Im really happy with this.  We play at least once a week. And yes, you can cast to most devices so people can watch what you are seeing.

I really enjoyed and still am playing with the oculus, specially with high res latest content but FB (meta) track record is not promising▶ Quality & DesignNice slice white finish, really well made and surprisingly light. The remotes are also ergonomically made and compliment the design of the headset. The straps on the head set are comfortable and easy to adjust▶ SetupAs you probably aware you will need a FB account. It's pretty useless without one, so if you get kicked out or banned from FB and unable to come back you get yourself a nice piece of nothingness... isn't that greatOn the other hand the setup was pretty seamless and fairly quick. The tutorial is helpful to get the know the system and its limitations. It's nice that you can set a safe zone in your view so you wont hit any furniture or other obstacles▶ UsageHigh res stuff look pretty awesome and you probably won't get dizzy or nausea but lower res content is no fun and motion will hit your head and limit your usage as you quickly get disorientated. The remotes are very responsive and the tracking and visualization on your headset works great with minimal lag✅ Pros: Newer content, comfortable, easy to use❌ Cons: Fb account needed, lots of old lower res contentOverall, if you don't mind been bound to FB this is a really great piece to technology

Appearance:Sleek headset that can adjust to your head size.  The handheld wands  blend with the appearance of the headset.Assembly:This is plug and play.  Take it out of the box and start exploring!Installation:Only downside is that you have to use a Facebook account to log onto the Quest 2.  That is the only way this will work.  You'll also get a good number of software/firmware updates for the unit, so be prepared to wait a little bit after turning it on for the first time.  It is worth the wait though!  Pull on the headset, adjust the straps to your liking and adjust the lenses to move slightly in or out depending on how your eyes are positioned on your face.Thoughts:Man, this thing is awesome!  The graphics are fantastic and you can truly get lost in the environments.  Even the Oculus lobby is breathtaking.  Software setup is super easy.  You set your physical playzone up and the headset will track how close or how far you are from the edges.  There is also passthrough which will allow you to see the physical space in front of you, albeit from an alternate universe-type view.It's a fantastic piece for gaming, exploring (check out the ISS from the inside!), and almost anything else you can think of.  Personally, we play a lot of Beat Saber in this and it is just so much fun.  The games are fairly simple to browse, the app store could use some user experience work, but it's definitely good enough.It does get a bit warm inside the face area, so if you're playing a very physical game, be prepared for some sweat.  It might be a good idea to invest in a face mask protector so the foam portion isn't getting all wet.Overall:I love this system.  I would happily buy it again

I want to start with the issue I had with the store. Before I got this headset, I had an Oculus Rift (original generation) and in the PC store, I purchased multiple games. When I got this headset, I thought that those purchases would transfer over, but unfortunately, I was mistaken. It turns out that certain games require you to re-purchase games for the Quest store, even if you already bought them through the Rift store. Now, I was informed that developers need to specifically engineer their game to the lower-performance platform, but as a consumer, it doesn't feel good to have to re-buy a game just because it's on a different platform. I thought they would at least offer a discount on the game if it was already purchased through the other store, but apparently not. There is a way around this by using the Quest Link (or Air Link) to basically play off the PC you would usually use but with the upgraded headset and inside-out tracking, which is what I ended up using for games I had already purchased on Rift.Store issues aside, this headset is so much better than VR used to be in the early days. The ability to play without wires or backpack PCs is amazing and it's hard to imagine going back! Especially with the workout apps, or full-room movement apps, no wires is the only way to play and feel fully immersed. The screen-door effect is also very reduced when compared to the Rift. Air Link is still in Early Access, so it doesn't work without issue, but when it works, it's a great way to get the full graphics processing power of a PC without any of the wires, tethers, or tracking system setup that both the Rift and Valve Index require. Of course, there are some trade-offs, but overall, I am very happy with this headset.

I'll start by saying that my only negative is the fit. It's really hard to get a decent fit, so the words aren't blurred at all. Could just be my head shape. It does have adjusters for the width and length, as well as the eye glass part can move inward or outward.Super easy to connect and get started. Does NOT have any preloaded games, you have to buy them separately, but there are a few samples on there. We bough beat sabers with an expansion pack and a roller coaster shooting game.Note, if you are prone to motion sickness, certain games you will not be able to play....I can't stomach the rollercoaster one, but beat sabers is fine.Volume is great. Can connect to our computer screen, so others can see what you see.So far, no issues at all.

I got the 128gb version of the Quest 2 and I absolutely love it. I used to have the Oculus Rift but ended up selling it because I no longer had a good room to set it up in with all the sensors, cords, and my PC. With the Oculus Quest 2 I no longer have these issues and can use the headset anywhere in my house (that has enough room) without worrying about where to setup the sensors and PC. The picture quality is good and I had no issues setting it up on my first use. It is pretty neat that you can connect it with your phone to show others what you are viewing within the VR headset. Overall the quality of the headset is great and it is so much easier to setup than the Oculus Rift.Pros:Wire FreeGreat trackingGood quality displayBuilt in audio is pretty good (and you have the ability to connect your own headphones)Good amount of games to choose fromAbility to connect to a PC to play more demanding gamesCons:Headset could distribute weight of the headset better (better options can be purchased)Not all previously purchased Oculus Rift games can be played on the Quest (a lot of them transfer over, but not all can be played unless you have the cable to connect it to a PC)Battery life isn't great for longer play sessions

This is my second quest 2 headset. I would recommend getting a 3rd party replacement headstrap with a battery pack holder. I think this is the best bang for your buck headset. It can operating independently with phone like graphics, or hook up to a PC. Overall Facebook keeps on adding new features, I like the use without the controllers.I had to go to a few hardware resets setting up different accounts with app sharing, but it was all working in the end. There is a limit of sharing of apps to only 1 headset, and the app owner must have the main account. The owner of the apps must use the other headset.  But playing cook out or mini golf is much more entertaining with a partner!

This device is a good way to immerse yourself in the VR world to take a break from the harsh reality.My main concerned is the FB requirement.
