I own both the HTC Vive original model and the Vive Pro.  You're reading this because you're trying to figure out which one to buy - the Vive original that's just over $400 or the Pro which is .. a lot more.Short version - if you're new to VR and you're worried the Vive Original isn't good enough - it is.  At $400+ it's a steal. You get so much value for what's an introduction price to typical consoles that you really can't go wrong.  If you're waffling on your decision, go with the Original and you'll be a happy camper.For those of you, like me, who are constantly asking ""But what if this 'Pro' model is so much better?"".  It's nice - it's just not ""Holy cow I'm so happy I blew my paycheck"" nice.Undoubtedly you've read the professional reviews so here's the non-professional review - the kind of advice you wished your best friend would just give you.  They did everything right with this headset.  It's more comfortable, the resolution chops down on the ""screen door effect"" that the pixelated original feels like, and it just feels like a more polished experience overall.  Even the remote camera sensors are a bit sleeker.The problem with this generation of VR is just that they can't deliver a ""retina like"" experience anywhere close to the price point consumers are willing to pay.  So while the Vive Pro is better, we're still 2-3 years away from getting an experience that doesn't feel compromised.You're still dealing with the issue of having to look dead straight to get the picture to resolve correctly.  You can still see pixels, albeit fewer.  The headset is still a bit wonky and heavy.  It's still Gen 1 VR.  Think of this as the Iphone S model upgrade where it's a bit better, but you're still a generation behind.So I'd leave the decision tree like this -1.  Just testing VR and want to see if it's legit?  Buy the Original2.  Totally enamored with VR and can appreciate a subtle improvement.  Buy the Pro.VR is amazing - and I say that as a total cynic. Even though there are only a handful of games out they are so immersive that it doesn't matter.  Don't think of it like playing console or PC games.  In this cases while the graphics are always getting better, the experience is the same.  In the case of VR, even games I've played an unreasonable amount of hours on (like Fallout 4) on my PC feel like entirely new experiences.One last caution - VR lasts maybe an hour at a time.  After that, it gives you a bit of a headache.  It sucks because you want the experience to keep going, but putting blinding screens an inch+ from your eyes for any period of time is gonna add up.  Think of it more like a ride at a theme park than an all-night couch dwelling console session.

I had previously given this 5 stars and raved about how the upgraded resolution looks.  I’m sad to say I have to do a 180 on that review.  After less than a month of using my vive Pro it started having various issues across the board.  I was getting red, green, blue static dots and both the video and audio would separately go out, or go out together.I contacted vive support and after going through troubleshooting steps with them that I had already tried on my own they finally agreed to send me a replacement cable to see if that was the issue (this was the link cable that goes from the hmd to the link box).  The replacement cable did not fix the issue yet support forced me to do the same troubleshooting steps yet again!  Finally they agreed to set it up for repair.  So I sent it out AT MY OWN COST and after 3 weeks to a month I got it back, in worse condition than I sent it out in!  Now all I get is flashing light and never see or hear ANYTHING!So let me ask you what kind of company charges $800 for something that NEVER works right, has you go through painstaking steps before agreeing to let YOU pay to send it to them and then sends it back to you even more broken than it was before?!  I currently have an email out to HTC about this and am waiting to hear back.  I will update this review if HTC turns this situation around for me and gets me a working vive pro but as of now it has been one of if not the worst experience I’ve ever had with a consumer electronic!

It is an incredibly comfortable headset. No dizziness for me and most that have tried mine.With a suitable graphics card and a PC that is at least a quad core i7, this will provide an amazing experience. In some ways its therapeutic.You need also two base stations and at least one paddle. Vive do their own base stations (AKA light houses) but for larger spaces there is an alternatives.  A good Internet connection is highly recommended - there s a lot to download when changing VR experiences.Now is a good time to buy as NVidia graphics card prices are on the slide due to the decline in the bitcoin market. You need at least an NVidia 1080 (or equivalent from another supported vendor) but for realistic Ray Tracing capability, one of the NVidia 2080 series is best. The graphics card must have a display port.I've stopped using it with XPlane 11 flight sim only because it is too addictive but with a powerful graphics card and full AI, the experience becomes extraordinarily realistic.Until a few months ago this was a top of the range. There's a new headset on the horizon with 4K per eye and 220 degree viewing angle but not from Vive and is USB-C (the future standard agreed for VR headsets). This model doesn't have USB-C but delivered with the required hardware. Setting up of the VR the first time can be a bit tricky.VR is not quite real life but the available media out there for games and eduction is phenomenal - highly recommend Google Earth VR, Apollo 11 Mission, The Lab, etc. Kids would enjoy walking amongst dinosaurs and its something the whole family would enjoy.While a fan of Apple Computers, getting them working with graphics processors (eGPU's) s has been tricky. Microsoft Windows (10 ideally) is currently the most supported platform for games and VR software.I hope you get one and enjoy it as much as I enjoy mine!

The good:VR games are fun! Beatport has been a blast, Subnautica has a been a bunch of fun as a VR port, my wife is loving moss.The Bad:All told it took ~5 hours of game play for one of the base stations (the little cubes that read your position in the room) to stop working. It just sits there with a blinking red light. Support tells me this is a hardware problem, and that to get it fixed I'll need to ship it back to them at my expense, wait about a month, then they'll hopefully ship a working unit back to me. I guess we're not doing any room-scale VR this month.At this price point I expected HTC to offer an advance shipment swap. One of those deals where they ship you a new working unit and you return the non-functional one in the same box promptly or they charge your credit card. But that's not something they will offer.Conclusion:I wont buy from HTC again.

I made the mistake of not immediately returning the system when i was having repeated tracking issues way back when i ordered it, and now im basically out the 2000 dollars this system costs because the support team doesn't listen and just has me reset my drivers over and over and over. If you get this headset and have any sort of tracking issues or controllers disconnecting, send it in for repair or refund immediately, before you get stuck with a fancy blue paperweight.

A diferencia de el HTC Vive regular, la resolucion de este headset es increible, dile adios a las letras borrosas cuando intentas leer menus o texto dentro de tus juegos VR.Lo bueno:-El strap con audio es excelente, infinitamente superior al vive regular. El audio es bastante bueno, pero nada impresionante pero la conveniencia de no tener que conectar audifonos externos es bienvenida-Las bocinas pueden ser removidas y ajustadas segun tus necesidades-No mas texto borroso en los juegos-Solamente requiere un cable, ya no son 3 como en el vive regularLo malo-Necesitas minimo una 1080Ti para no estar en constante reprojection (si no te molesta esto, o si no sabes lo que es, entonces ni te preocupes)en juegos pesados como Skyrim VR,Fallout 4 VR o Doom VFR.-Removieron el jack de 3mm para audifonos, ahora se requiere de un adaptador externo USB C  (esto duele si quieres usar audifonos premium)-Por el precio, no incluye ni las bases, ni los controles, esto significa que si no tienes un vive regular con los sensores y controles, tienes que adquirirlos por separado y el precio se dispara.-Hasta el momento, no hay juegos ni apps que utilizen las dos camaras frontales, solo una esta activada en estos momentos.Resumen: La parte ""PRO"" del nombre de este producto no parece ser una broma o una tecnica de mercadotecnia, este producto definitivamente no esta hecho para el consumidor regular. Es un excelente equipo pero si no vas a participar en el desarrollo de aplicaciones o juegos en VR yo sugeriria abstenerse y disfrutar el vive regular por un año mas, en lo que se desarrollan las nuevas versiones para consumidores.

I own the original VIVE headset since it debuted a couple of years ago. I decided to buy the PRO version for business, because of all the positive reviews about its reliability and increased resolution.Set-up: overall, it was pretty bad. I've read the stories about the long setup process that the PRO headset requires. I chose not to believe them, because I thought of myself as a pretty experienced person with VR. After all, I have the original VIVE and know how to deal with software updates and troubleshoot issues.Well, friends, I was wrong. At first everything was fine, as the little program that I downloaded from the HTC website was guiding me through the process. Then I was asked to sign in with the HTC account, so that I can ""enjoy"" my several months of free membership of their VR store. I googled around, and there was no way of continuing the installation of the headset without the HTC account. DEAR HTC, please don't drag me into your store if I am not interested. As a customer, I don't appreciate the strong-arming. I don't need another store subscription. I know what you are thinking: ""he bought the headset, he has the installation running = he is invested deep enough now that he will register for the store account, even if he doesn't really want it."" Nice calculus, but I am no longer a happy customer of yours after this kind of treatment.Long story short, I did register for the HTC account; I singed in with my Steam account. Moving on, the HTC install program did not recognize my USB 3 port as USB 3, no matter how I tried. USB 3 is required for optimum performance of the two cameras on the headset. That's fine, I thought, let's just skip this step. Then the installation program proceeded to download a whole bunch of stuff, including their store program which I did not really need, all in excess of 1 gig.  At this point, I felt the process was becoming too involving. I was asked then to update all the software in the headset itself and the controllers. When all was done, at the end of the installation, I began receiving error messages from HTC software trying to sort things out with the Steam store and Steam VR. It was confusing and annoying, like watching two stores - HTC and STEAM -  fight it out on my desktop. I also downloaded the latest NVIDIA drivers (I run a 1080 card), and updated windows as well.Actual Use:I installed the lighthouses in the same spots where I had the original VIVE lighthouses installed. These things were supposed to be better, so I was pretty excited. Set up Room Scale VR as usual, set AUDIO in Steam VR to HMD, put on the headset and... the word to describe how I felt is ""underwhelming."" Many reviews say the screen door effect is ""almost gone"", ""barely visible"", or even ""totally solved."" I don't know how much these websites depend on advertising revenue from Steam or HTC, but the screen door effect is - clearly, 100%, in-your-face - there. I wasn't trying to look for it, I just wanted to focus on the image, but the screen door effect was photo-bombing everything just like it does in the original VIVE that was made 2 years ago.Yes, the headset is more comfortable than the original! And like most reviewers claim, it is a big deal. This is the only positive thing that I can say about the headset.Performance: With my 1080 card, I did not notice any jitter or frame drops. However, I had a lot of tracking issues where the floor would start flying from underneath me, or I would be pushed into the wall in the VR. I did room set up many many many times, and I adjusted the lighthouses many many many many times, trying all possible angles. I troubleshoot the headset for defective hardware, all was good. Did the setups again, and again received tracking madness. I switched back My original VIVE, and everything worked rock-solid. Then I did some googling, and it is a known issue. It seems, this new VIVE PRO is super-susceptible to issues if there are reflective surfaces nearby. I have several windows in my VR area that I suspect were causing the problem. However, my original VIVE has zero issues with those windows. I thought the VIVE PRO is supposed to be BETTER, right? I mean, more reliable? What's up with this, HTC? How come my original VIVE performs better than your newest PRO version? I bought this for business, I don't have time tinkering with it all the time. My original VIVE seems to be more PRO reliable than this newest, super-expensive, ""PRO"" version.In the end, I decided to return VIVE PRO, because it feels like a step backward to me. Even the plastic looks cheap compared to the original version. Same with presentation - the box is horrible. Seems like HTC just doesn't care as much as they cared when they released the original headset. It feels like they were trying to cut costs with this (and charge an arm and a leg at the same time, to make it a winning business strategy).Here's my recommendation:- if you have the original VIVE, buy a strap with built-in headphones, and your VIVE will be as comfortable as the new one. The resolution bump sounds impressive on paper, but in real life, you will -barely- notice it. Barely. Wait until HTC gets it game together and produces a truly next generation VR headset. This VIVE PRO is a scam.- if you don't have any VR headset and want one now; buy the original VIVE if you want superior tracking, plus the wireless add-on, plus the strap with built-in headphones. You will have a superior VR experience, AND save a ton of money that you can put towards the next generation VR when it comes out, spend on a Hawaiian vacation, invest in the stock market, or whatever you want to do with it. VIVE PRO is just too glitchy.Still feel like you want VIVE PRO? Then read all the horror stories on redit about people spending weeks and months trying to make the tracking work. Google ""VIVE Pro tracking issues"". Still want to buy it? I totally understand, why believe someone else's experience, when you can witness these problems first-hand? Go ahead and buy it. Amazon has a great return policy.To those of you who happen to have zero reflective surfaces in or near your VR area, and your PRO is working for you - good for you. I still don't understand how my original VIVE works so flawlessly in same area where this ""PRO"" version is a total puke-inciting mess. What's going on with you, HTC?

I have ordered the VR headset from Amazon Warehouse Deals and the headset is just dead not working at all. There is a big sticker on the box stating that this is a TESTED DEVICE FROM AMAZON and guest what it's not working. There was also a big sticker on the Headset from the previous owner ( West River School something like that) so that mean that the headset was probaly used by many many people before sent back to Amazon. You should definitely be very cautious when buying Amazon Warehouse Deals because it's cleared that those are customer returns NOT TESTED and CAREFULLY CLEANED.

Not Plug n Play for MacOS Mojave. Which had been announced by Apple 2018. HTC also walked away from their opportunity with Apple firmly stated NO MAC/APPLE Support from HTC Online/Call Centre. This was not communicated to Apple Support or Retail employees which was a vicious circle of HW & SW and two manufacturers pointing fingers to one another and driving hopefully  VR Mac users away.For Apple I am going to say I have had it and will be buying a PC and Mid-Advanced level HUD and equipment...Occulu? Perhaps Apple will release their own and put these barely 1.5/2gen VR solutions to shame.One thing I think Apple & HTC also smeared the YouTube/Googles algorithms because barely any other HTC VR / Apple / Steam users comments exist post Fall 2018 search results...Definitely not a good hobby for early adopters...

I'm passionate about VR and have been since i first played Dactyl Nightmare in the 90s.  I enjoyed the Vive a ton and the upgrade to the Vive pro is a huge step in terms of visuals.  Everything is clearer, the screen door effect is nearly gone and the headset is much more comfortable.  The built in headphones are great and seem better than those on the premium strap upgrade but are still basic.In the box for my unit was an annual Viveport Subscription which gives you access to 5 games a month for 12 months (worth $144 CAD) & a Viveport credit of $125 CAD to purchase games.If you already have a Vive and enjoy it a lot, this is a great upgrade.  If you don't, the price tag just doesn't make sense.

Image quality so much better than original Vive. Headset is much more comfortable and cable more compact and less distracting. Screen door effect much less noticeable though not entirely eliminated. God rays effect is lessened too though still present especially for games with deep blacks such as Elite Dangerous. There remains an issue with the sweet spot of focus for me, still too narrow (compared to say the Quest) causing blur at the edges. Perhaps related to FOV, though I have an above average head size and pupil distance which might be the cause of this in my case.Still, overall a terrific improvement, which with a slightly lower price and the addition of wireless would easily be the best VR I've experienced yet.Loss of one star though for the price which even as an upgrade is a little on the high side, and far worse for the whole package.

So I have had this for a few days now, and would consider myself a VR enthusiast. This is purely for personal use, no business or professional stuff at all. And I paid full price... so part of me wants to feel good about the money I spent, but I'm well aware it is still overpriced.Main take away; the increased pixel density is noticeable. Text is much easier to read, and everything is much more clear. As you have surely read, the screen door effect is not gone. But, it's far less intrusive. I found particularly in driving games on the regular Vive it was distracting. But now, it's minimal. This is a big plus, and 90% of the reason I wanted it.Audio. The speakers are much worse. Really disappointed there. I have been hooked on Beat Saber, but now the music sounds super flat and dull. Takes the groove out of the game.Update: use a powered USB hub, seems to help a lot.Comfort. At first, I was afraid it was worse, but then watched the video and now it's about equal I'd say. Perhaps better balanced. Put the mask on first, then lower the strap behind you after, and then adjust the top strap last. Then move the ear pieces. It's pretty  good, but not a huge improvement.Other things I've noticed, every now and then the audio is very crackly. Have to reboot it to fix. And I'm noticing my base stations are wonkier than before. Maybe a firmware update is to come.So, if you love VR, this is a good buy. It makes everything better. If you have kinda slowed down using VR, this probably won't reignite the flame, unless you mostly like driving games, or maybe text heavy games like Elite Dangerous.

I was very skeptical about Vive Pro and the overall improvement in resolution and SDE based on so many people complaining that the difference is not much noticeable. I took the dive anyways and bought the Vive Pro, and I'm happy to say It's a major improvement. I see a clear difference with higher resolution and image clarity. SDE is much reduced. While perceived image quality is subjective but I would say anyone who claims that there's no noticeable difference need to have their vision checked.The SDE effect is still there though and noticeable but not as horrible as OG Vive. Also, major improvement in comfort as well compared to OG Vive with DAS. I have Vive Wireless Adapter on top and still the headset is extremely comfortable for hours of gameplay.One star off for audio quality which is a complete disappointment compared to DAS. I don't have tinny sound issues as many were reporting, but the volume and bass levels are extremely lacking for my taste. After hours of researching and troubleshooting I ended up 3D printing Vive Pro bass clips that press headphones more firmly on my ears (you can get the 3D file from Vive Community discussion forum).Lenses, FOV and god rays are exact same as OG Vive. I bought a 6mm face foam that allows for a little improvement in FOV. The cable compartment door on headset is way too flimsy and easy to break. It's a bad design. Be careful when opening and be gentle.Mic quality is on par with OG Vive but overall it's not good. I don't use mic anyways. Camera quality is a bit worse though. Currently there's a bug with SteamVR that it doesn't allow to change camera rate so it's locked are 45. If I can change it to 60 and notice improvement I'll update the review. The dual camera stereo room view with pass through is extremely cool, but again everyone is experiencing a bug now that the stereo separation is incorrect and you feel like cross-eyed.Amazon initially shipped an open box (seal broken) but they were quick to send a new sealed box the next day so again best service from Amazon to quickly correct the mistake.There are currently other headset on the rise such as Pimax 5K+ and 8K, but it all depends on your choices and priorities. My #1 priority is wireless. Wired VR gaming was never an option for me and a total immersion breaker. My first dive in VR was with OG Vive, TPCast and Fallout 4 VR, so that's where I'm coming from. I've never played wired. Pimax headsets consumer launches are months away, and no updates on wireless module plans. I can easily give up a wider FOV for wireless option and better support any day.The bottom line - Vive Pro is the ultimate current headset available for consumers. It has it's pros and cons but it depends on your priorities, system specs, choices and budget. Is it worth 999? Absolutely not; it's way overpriced. Is it the best headset? Yes absolutely, depending what your prioritize.Until Pimax 5K+ ships with a wireless module or the Vive 2.0 becomes available, this is the best of the best you can get. Hoe this helped.

It wasn’t made clear that the headset doesn’t come with everything you need.  Does not come with the base stations, had to purchase after seeing on the box that they are required.  Also the headset was very finicky to set up, constantly failing to connect and randomly asking for firmware updates after already having done previous firmware updates.  Seems like the software could use some improvement.  Shortly after setting up the headset a brand new video card failed, not sure if that’s related or not, but if it happens again after replacement I’ll update my review.

The Vive is still my favourite VR headset on the consumer market. Having room scale VR has been a fantasy of mine since seeing the holodeck on Star Trek and immediately asking my mom where we could buy one. I love getting lost in a world that is a little weird and takes some getting used to, but it's still me in it. Unfortunately the Vive pro missteps in several key areas.First off the good points. The image quality is fantastic. I did a side by side with the original Vive and there is a noticeable difference in clarity. Being able to read text from across the room like at an optomitrist office is not able to be done in the original Vive. In the pro i was able to read across the entire play space which is a good 10 feet. This will no doubt become far more important as VR games get more detailed. Another big plus is the strap. It is easy to adjust to basically any head size including my massive head. The frame fits snugly and the foam has enough give that it doesn't hurt my head. The weight is also well balanced. The original Vive was noticeably front heavy. The pro addresses this issue with the heavy duty plastic wrap around design and it does feel more comfortable. This made playing longer sessions much better.What I absolutely cannot endorse are the included headphones. They sound like the old blown out speakers my middle school used in classrooms. For most gamers this may not be a big issue. However, take a look at the number 2 top selling VR game. Beat Saber. A rhythm game with VERY bass heavy music. You do not get the same impact during the song if it sounds like it's coming out of a tin can. Props to HTC for making these removable. I encountered a similar problem with the original Vive, but this issue was resolved by my lovely pair of bluetooth headphones. The super comfy strap unfortunately means that headphones do not sit on your head properly.  This makes waving your arms and head around really challenging which defeats the whole point of VR.The Vive pro definitely proves that it is the best quality consumer headset out there right now. The picture is great and it is more comfortable than its predecessor which might be enough to justify the increased cost for some. For audiophiles like myself it is a disappointment. I will stick with my original Vive for now and hope that the next gen headset can deliver a truly upgraded experience.

Like others have said, yes it has better visuals, but not by a lot. That being said, I can never go back to the old Vive that I own. The comfort is underestimated, it allows you to have longer VR sessions which is what its all about!  The sound is ""good enough"" nothing bad and nothing great. Its simply good sound.-Reading Text is much better! (that also goes for UI's, Health bars, ammo bars etc!..-Seeing gun crosshairs is WAY easier! (you can hit targets! your aim is on point!)-Seeing farther and clearer is HUGE! (I shot a arrow straight up in Skyrim and followed it all the way down!)The Pro blocks out the real world like a Champion! no light passes though the nose guard (which is more comfortable I might add) And the headphones cups your ears to block out outside noise. what this translates to is a more immersive experience and longer VR sessions which is a HUGE plus! I mean its what its all about, right?!This small bump is actually HUGE why? because its just the right amount of tech that still runs the current hardware! We are a few years away from a proper Gen 2 HMD, (that also goes for the computer hardware to run the new HMD) so this will pass the time if its worth it to you.Simply put, if you want the best VR.. look no further, this is it.  The best room-scale tracking coupled with this HMD will allow you to experience the absolute best VR that's currently available!A personal note:I have to say, after modding the hell out of Skyrim it does LOOK SICK (45+ mods and tweaks). I was chilling behind Riverwood at night (with darker nights mod) crouched with my back against the mountain, listening to the sounds looking up at the insane sky with stars shining and the moon, cloud movement dancing on the mountain tops etc...Just taking it all in, it was so awe inspiring, I am constantly at a loss of words with this setup. This is a expensive unit, no doubt.. but do you think for a second I would trade it for the countless ""oh crap!"" moments i've had, not on your life!As a kid in the 80's staring at store shelves filled with awesome hand drawn box cover art of high fantasy PC games. Wishing I could just teleport inside those images and explore the majestic worlds within, now finally after all these years, here I am.I took a few screenshots last night, just to capture the moment, but it doesn't tell the tale. Whiterun in the distance, with a glorious celestial  event. Being INSIDE this world is AMAZING.

I am changing my review from a 5 star rating to a 1 star rating due to the terrible customer service that HTC offers.I have owned the Vive Pro a little over 6 months and the link box died 2 months ago. After calling Amazon, I was referred to HTC for warranty repair; no problem I thought. I created a ticket through their email system same-day the link box died.*****There is no Customer Support Phone Number and if you do try another HTC department thinking you can escalate, HTC still cannot help you***** It took over a week for someone from HTC to respond. After getting stuck into a month loop of questions and waiting days for a response, HTC finally agrees to exchange my link box. We'll it's been over 3 weeks since the agreement, and I still do no have a a tracking number or have received the new link box. I am also not getting a response on the emails asking if the device has shipped. Yes, this box is around 40-50 bucks, however it is the principle of the matter that the warranty department refuses to service the issue or care about their customers.When the Vive Pro works, it's solid and way better than anything I have tried on the market. I have a friend that has the Oculus and another that has a regular Vive. Both have purchased the Vive Pro after trying my Pro out. Now, I regret influencing them in-case their Pro has issue and they are ran through the nightmare I am going through.Take my comments as a grain of salt, however this is an expensive product and you would think HTC would care about their customers. Especially the early buyers. All I can say, buyer BEWARE!

Let me preface that I am (was) a diehard HTC supporter when it comes to VR. I tried Oculus Rift, several Windows MR headsets, and HTC Vive (the original, not Pro). I felt that Vive had the best implementation as far as tracking, expandability, and connectivity to PC. Some feel that Oculus controllers are better, but personally I prefer Vive wands. I have owned original Vive for over a year and the whole family (and friends) love to use it and play VR games. With that said, I purchased Vive Pro at a (ridiculously) high price because to me it was worth it and I was looking forward to upgrades. What a disappointment it was! Just to be clear - I ordered two different headsets and one full Vive Pro kit (with new 2.0 base stations and new 2.0 controllers) because I wanted to make sure I didn’t get a dud. I experienced various issues with all of them and they were all returned. The tracking was worse comparing to my original Vive, one headset would not keep the floor leveled no matter what I tried and how many times I ran room calibration, controllers would not always show up, constant connection issues when headset would need to be re-plugged, one headset would have flickering lights in the HMD… etc. It was just awful, and it was in exact same large room that is perfect for VR that my original Vive works perfectly, connected to the same high-power gaming rig. I re-installed Windows fresh twice thinking maybe it was related to previous Vive installation or something similar, so I started fresh and the same issues persisted. I spent hours on user forums, reddit, HTC support forum looking for answers and was amazed how many people have similar issues and all the crazy workarounds one need to do to get it to work properly sometimes.With all that, the worst part was HTC support. I contacted them to see what they can suggest in one of the scenarios and after explaining everything that I have already tried, the rep said that HMD must be defective and needs to be sent to them for repairs and it is covered under warranty. Here is the kick though – as others mentioned in reviews, you have to pay to ship anything to HTC out of your pocket, they won’t reimburse you or provide a shipping label even though the product is defective, they won’t do advance exchange, you have to wait at least two weeks... and if they determine (at their own discretion) that it is something that is not covered by the warranty you will have to either pay to have it fixed (at a quote they will give you later) or have to pay to get your non-working part back. Needless to say, I simply returned all of them to the retailers I bought them from and I will never buy it again. I have since talked to several other VR users that had very similar experiences with Vive Pro. I understand that any product can have issues and kinks may need to work out, but when the company doesn’t stand behind the product they have built and does not support the adopters of their products – this is really the worst business practice and the easiest way to push your supporters away. I would highly recommend doing your research before buying HTC Vive Pro, most likely you will be disappointed and will not enjoy it; and if you’ll need support from HTC – be ready to pay more and wait. I still think that original Vive is a good product and I continue using it. One of my base stations stopped working on the original Vive and even though it was still under warranty I had to pay shipping and wait two weeks to get it fixed… oh well… at least I can still use it an enjoy it. My next VR set will NOT be an HTC product unless the company addresses the bugs and more importantly changes their customer support approach.

I have had a regular Vive with Deluxe Audio Strap and have played it almost daily for about a year so I have a solid experience with which to compare. There is a price premium on the Pro and it's not for everyone. If you are budget conscious, there's no need to save up to buy the Pro. If you like the best of what's available, then give this one a shot.1) Set-up was a breeze. I followed the instructions offered on the Vive website (although you could just install it without referring to the website as it's very obvious what needs to be done). Important to note: The original Vive plugged into an HDMI connector on my video card. The Pro requires the display port adapter on the video card. I also manually forced a firmware update on the headset.2) The unit ships with ONE face pad while the original Vive shipped with two (Wide and Narrow). The face pad for the Pro is slightly larger along the top edge. The original face pads will work with it but they don't provide as much padding but it's not really noticeable). So far, nobody sells face pads for the Vive Pro (not even HTC).3) The display is noticeably clearer. When I put on the Pro headset and stood in the Steam VR Home, I was amazed at the difference. The graininess and screen doo effect are noticeably reduced. It's not perfect but it IS an improvement which you can see. When in games, the improvements eventually fade into the normal playing experience but everything does look better. This helps with reading text (particularly flight sims).4) The comfort of the Pro headset is improved. It rests on the head with better balance and fit. It requires more adjustments when swapping between players. The Deluxe head strap was much easier to adjust quickly.5) The audio is about the same as the deluxe head strap. I haven't seen any improvement in quality or comfort. I do like the inclusion of a volume adjustment and microphone mute button on the ear pieces.6) Adjustment buttons. I like the simplified adjustment used to move the display closer or further from your eyes. Apparently you can do this on the original Vive but it required pressing two buttons. The IPD adjustment knob (adjusts the left-right spacing of the lenses) is a little more difficult to turn. The old one was a know which you could turn by twisting it between your thumb and finger. The Pro is more of a hheel than you need to use a finger to rotate. Not a big deal, but it's something I noticed..Overall, I am happy I have this as I like to have the best experiences I can when playing. At the current price, it's not for everyone and for most, I would say that buying the normal Vive will more than satisfy, especially if you take the money saved and buy a better video card. One crowd that might like this are hardcore flight sim players as there tends to be a lot of text which you need to read. The Pro certainly helps make the text  more legible.

This review is about how the product was shipped.  Unless I made a complete mistake I was buying a used very good condition.  I can live without the original packaging but as u can see from the picture they dumped the equipment loose in a box twice as large as need and put absolutely nothing in to protect it not even a air pillow.  Picture is from the moment I opened the box, the head set seems fine but the infrared modules are very scuffed up.  I'm.going to see if the scuffs effect anything and I need to take a close look at the lenses.  Right tnow I'm very un happy

Love the VR experience; play Beat Saber now!I held off until the second generation Vive came out thinking it would somehow be better and the kinks would be worked out. However, my nephew also purchased an Oculus Rift a week after I purchased the Vive Pro for 1/3 the price and there is no noticeable differences in game play.  SteamVR errors constantly pop up telling me programs are already running. Sensor setup is tricky to get right.My nephew plays games while I play around with setup. The Vive is still in development stages. Purchase it only if you like to fiddle around to get things to work.Update: After the first few weeks I started having serious tracking problems with the controllers and headset. Read many of the news groups and tried many of the fixes (reinstall, new USB port, disable camera tracking etc) but it still doesn't work. Tired to do a return for a refund but found out I was 5 days past the deadline. Really, really, wish I purchased an Oculus Rift and saved a bunch of headaches and money!

Honestly, after reading a lot of the reviews saying the quality isn't ""that big of an improvement"" I was extremely hesitant to buy this. But man, I'm really glad I did. Where the headphones are garbage, you can remove them and use whatever headphones you see fit. (I use Wireless Steel Series Siberia 800, great headset to use with it) The strap is a little clunky, as it is easy to notch back if you try to get it too tight, however, you don't need it so tight it's breaking your face to use it properly.I've noticed a lot of people who seem to have problems with the lack of quality don't understand that your computer needs to be good enough to handle it. It's quite a lot more taxing on your system than the normal vive and thus wont work perfectly on every system that previously could use vive just fine. That being said, if you do have a computer that can handle the increased pixels, you'll definitely notice it.

The HTC Vive Pro Eye system is CURRENTLY NOT CAPABLE OF FOVEATED RENDERING as advertised!! There are demos from their partner Tobii's website that demonstrate eye tracking, which works well, but there DOES NOT EXIST at least ONE DEMO that demonstrates Foveated Rendering in action! I contacted HTC and they confirmed this to me. So, what this implies is that foveated rendering is NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE as it cannot be proven with a technology demo. They are basically using sales from HTC Vive Pro Eye to fund current ON-GOING  research into future foveated rendering implementation. There is probably too much latency for foveated rendering to be feasible at this point... IF YOU WANT FOVEATED RENDERING NOW DO NOT BUY THIS SYSTEM! It will not deliver that capability. If you are interested in eye tracking/ VR integration and do not mind parting with a considerable amount of money for that, go ahead and buy one! It's also worth mentioning, despite their display panels operating at a higher resolution than most on the market, the lenses are sub-par at best compared to even Oculus Rift CV1 lenses! The Oculus Rift lenses have a greater range of clarity compared to the considerably more expensive HTC Vive Pro. Oculus uses a combination spherical and a finely graduated fresnel pattern compared to HTC Vives very coarsely graduated FRESNEL ONLY flat lense. This results in considerable blurriness in the periphery which gives them a very narrow ""sweet spot"" compared to even Oculus Rift CV1! I was very shocked to discover a system in the price range using Cardboard VR lenses... WTF??? You can add to that the terrible customer service... One of the CSRs I spoke to didn't know anything about a recently released product... In my opinion, don't waste your money...

For over a year HTC had not been able to fix the most basic functionality of its VR set: the ability to indicate the charging status of its controllers. There are A LOT of complaints from people on HTC forums, with HTC only be able to say “Blame Valve’s Steam VR”. Well, I didn’t buy the set from Valve. I bought it from HTC, through Amazon. HTC is the manufacturer, HTC is the warranty provider, HTC is responsible for how the set operates.Besides that, the headset has basically no ventilation whatsoever. The lenses produce A LOT of glare, and compounded by lack of ventilation - they also fog up A LOT, making playing games in it a terrible experience.The controllers are very heavy and the shape is such that they just want to slip out of your hands. Playing, say, Beat Saber with these is a constant exercise in frustration. The VR controllers should not require you to constantly making sure you’re holding them very strongly.At this time, I think this kit is severely outdated and overpriced. If you want a good headset - look elsewhere. I’m personally looking forward to getting Valve Index.This HTC kit is worth half of the asking price at best.

Got this after a month-long wait (thanks, COVID!), only for it not to work.  Several hours of troubleshooting and I narrowed it down to the proprietary link cable from the headset to the [pointless] base station.  By the way, these used to interface directly with the PC via standard cabling, but the base station was added with the latest models so they can gouge you to go wireless with bluetooth...using only their overpriced add-ons, of course.As far as trying to get it to work, everything said it was working great, but nothing except a blank, bright screen in the display.  SteamVR would come up as ""running"" and not turn off, with no display on the screen.  The HTC software they try to trick people into installing (note: you don't need to install it at all)  is utter garbage and even caused driver and resource conflicts with Steam.  My computer is no slouch, met or far exceeded all requirements, and I've gotten three other VR systems to work with far less hassle in the past.  I'm not new to this.  I found plenty of videos and write-ups with workarounds on older models that HTC has seen fit to change so you're stuck with their deficient hardware, or I might have taken it apart on day one just to get it functioning.It's simply a defective product, and I should have done some deeper searching for what HTC hasn't crawler-bombed out of search indexes to know that before I bought it.  Everything about it is an insidious cash grab and the sleek exterior hides some shoddy craftsmanship where it really counts.  At least Amazon makes the return easy.  I imagine they do several.

I bought the HTC Vive Pro system for my son for his birthday.  I originally wanted to get him the older one since it was half the price, but most places were out of stock so he wouldn't have it in time for his birthday.  My nephew has the old system, so we have used it many times, so this review is my comparison from the Vive to the Vive Pro.  From the moment you open the box you can see there is a difference in the two systems.  The Vive Pro has been colored blue which I can only guess is to make it look different enough from the original system to make people want to buy it?  The setup is exactly the same for both systems.  They make a very complex system easy to set up by numbering each box.  By going in order opening each box, its pretty much fool proof.  I would warn everyone to make sure before you setup this unit, go into Device Manager in Windows and verify that all your drivers are installed and working (If you see a red x or a yellow exclamation mark, fix this before installing the Vive).  When I attempted to set this up on my son's computer, his USB 3.0 driver wasnt installed.  This caused a lot of issues.  Luckily I have been a computer engineer for almost 20 years, because I can't imagine how a non-technical person would have gotten around this.  The whole setup took about 2 hours to complete (that includes mounting the sensors and hiding the wires inside the walls.  Be sure before you begin to verify your computer far exceeds the minimum requirements.  When I was researching the difference between the Vive & the Vive Pro, they kept mentioning the higher graphics resolution, but I have to say, I don't see much of a difference in the 2 systems.  In fact, in my opinion, the only difference I see in the two systems is the color of the headset and controller and an upgrade in how the headset is constructed.  Knowing what I know now, if presented the opportunity to choose between the Vive and the Vive Pro, I don't think paying the extra money was worth it.  I paid almost $1,500 total (tax included) for the system, whereas you can get the old Vive system for around $800.  I personally don't see enough of a difference in the two systems to warrant that kind of price jump.  I will say that this system is like nothing you have ever seen before.  The VR is so realistic you actually feel like you are somewhere else.  Between the lifelike graphics and the amazing accompanying audio, you will not believe just how realistic this system is.  If you look at the price without trying the system out, the price seems outrageous.  Once you try the VR for yourself, you totally understand why its so expensive.  If you have the money for one of these systems (either the original Vive or the Vive Pro) I recommended purchasing it.  You won't be disappointed.  The VR experience is like nothing you have ever experienced before.

The ergonomics, link box, cabling, and resolution are great. But the lenses are subpar and are now the worst part of the visuals. The lenses create banding, blur around the periphery, and god rays. I can't wait until I can get aftermarket lenses for this thing to replace them.You also can't change the brightness on the headset except to ""night mode"". I would like something in between. The default brightness is too bright, especially with the god ray problem this thing has. Currently, I just stay in night mode always, but I have to set it by hand every day.The controllers have side buttons that are too easy to press. In games such as shooty-fruity, I constantly press the side buttons accidentally while pulling the trigger. Pressing the side button results in dropping the gun, which is really frustrating. The controllers also still use micro USB for some reason. $120 each seems like too much for these things.Expect to buy your own longer Displayport->minidisplayport and USB Male-to-Male cords unless your play area is directly against the back of your PC.The tracking is usually pretty good, but I had to remove some glass from the play area. Even now, every hour or so there's some kind of blip. What I don't understand is why this can't be detected. Why can't gameplay can't pause and why can't the headset can't go dark when it believes my headset literally teleported under the floor or shot 5 feet to the upper left at 400 mph? The game just keeps going and punishes you while you get a headache.These faults are small enough that 5 stars would be possible if the system were $800 or less, but at $1300, it needs to be better.

I have a Vive and bought this for the added resolution.  The display resolution is better than the Vive, but they really went downhill with the headband and headphone design.  The audio quality is crap - no bass at all.  They are also really bulky and make you look even more dorky than you do wearing a VIve.  I took the earphones off mine and use a Logitech headset instead.  The headband is sort of like the DAS, except its much bulkier, sticks out in the back, is uncomfortable compared to the DAS, and the whole thing is about 6 ounces heavier than the Vive - yes, it is heavier, not lighter than a Vive with the DAS, contrary to what HTC claims.  In addition, the headband does not have the spring loaded feature that the DAS has, so donning and removing the headset is now more difficult.  They only give you one face pad that is ""improved"" but in fact it is stiffer and less comfortable than the ones that come with Vive - took me a long time to break mine in to where it felt reasonably comfortable on my head, and only after applying a lot of velcro at the edges to make it conform to my face.  On the plus side the AMOLED display technology makes bright scenes feel less like you're getting your eyes cooked, and it seems easier on the eyes overall.  Tracking is very good and might actually be better than the Vive, using the standard Vive lighthouses.  The resolution is incrementally better than the Vive and actually makes a difference for applications like X-Plane or Elite Dangerous, but for most games, or just casual VR entertainment, it's not worth the added cost.  My Vive Pro was defective right out of the box and it took me a while to convince HTC to the point they would generate an RMA so I could return it via Amazon.  After some finagling, I was able to get Amazon to ship me the replacement without charging my credit card twice (then getting a refund later).  The one I have now seems to work fine - no issues after several months.  One last thing - it's also not the shade of blue that it appears to be in the photos - it's almost black.

I've owned many VR headsets and systems over the past few years, and the Vive pro has to be the only one that's seriously made me question its price. As of current, I have a original Vive, Original Rift, Valve Index, a dell visor that I sold, and now a Vive Pro HMD. It's not all bad, but there's no reason it should be nearly 800$ for the headset alone. Lets get into it.Pros:To start. This headset is very light and comfortable in comparison to some of the other headsets I've owned. The balance of the weight seems to be nicely distributed across the skull, while fitting snug on the face. I'd say that, depending on who you asked, it's as comfortable or even more comfortable then the index. It's lighter then the index, and better balanced. A definite improvement in that regard.Additionally, the display is much better then the original Vive's. It's not perfect, and it definitely still has a screen door effect, but not nearly as blatant as older headsets like the Rift and Vive.Microphone is also a great improvement. It's still not the best out of all the headsets I own, but it's much better than the Rift and Vive.Cons:Unfortunately there's quite a few cons I have for this headset. The first major one I noticed was the earphones. They're TERRIBLE. For the price and size of the earmuffs, this is simply an unacceptable quality of sound for a ""pro"" headset. The Vive's audio strap accessory even blows it completely out of the water, and I'd say that the rift's dinky headphones are about par with this headset. Seeing as the original rift is worth less then half of this headset, I find it extremely frustrating. The audio has almost now low-end and is very ""tinny"".Next is the proprietary cable. This isn't a show stopper... but the fact that I had to buy a 60$ accessory pack to attach my wireless module to the already 800$ new headset is insane in my opinion. Seems like a very large anti-consumer move from HTC. The link box is fine though, and the length of the cable is adequate, but the same accessory pack for the Cosmos is cheaper AND comes with a spare battery with the same cable...My last major gripe with this headset is the lens they chose. It seems that they decided to just use the same lenses from the original vive. Godrays and glare are just as bad or even seemingly worse then the vive, and that's just unacceptable for a headset of this caliper. Additionally, the IPD adjustment doesn't allow for tighter adjustment then 61.5mm, while it's advertised as a range from 60-73mm just like the original viveOverall:In all honesty, if I didn't need this headset to keep wireless adapter and upgrade to the 2.0 base stations, then I'd say to avoid it at all cost. Weigh your options with other headsets. It's way overpriced for what it is, and with better options on the market like Index and Pimax, it's not justifiable. If you already own a vive, then just keep it... this isn't much of an improvement in any way other then slightly improved pixel density and microphone quality. I got this headset for 500$, so 300$ cheaper then MSRP, and it's still not worth that in value. It should be a 400$ package for just the HMD, and maybe 700-800$ for the full kit it to really be worth it. Anything more and it's beat by better options for better prices.Thanks for coming to my TED talk

I'm running the Pro with wireless kit, and have my base stations on a pole and basically they NEVER get moved, touched, hit etc. After a few months, a base station will 'die', which is indicated by a blinking red light. It is a hardware failure, and online vive support says send it in. Apparently, there numerous reports that sending it in is a dead end. So that means I have to buy a new base station which is $130-$200. Just bought my second replacement unit. Absolutely egregious. Shameful. Be warned, do your own homework on this, search forums etc.

Okay. So here it is.  I am a big VR enthusiast.  I have had 4 Oculus Rifts, 3- Samsung Gear VRs, etc.  I have been waiting, waiting and waiting some more (like 2 years) for a new game-changing VR headset to come out.  When I saw the Vive Pro Eye, I about lost it.  What does it matter if it's $1600+ if I can actually jump into a new reality and feel like I'm really there?! Right?  So I bought it.  Man, am I disappointed.  Just shipped it back as quick as I could.  The FOV was real small, it seamed like I was looking at everything through a tunnel.  There was obvious blurring along the sides of my vision/the screen, and the headset felt awkward, clumsy and unnatural.  If you already have a VR headset (Oculus or Vive) keep it - DO NOT GET THIS HEADSET!  I guess we will have to keep waiting.  Now about the seller - Aventis Systems.  It appears they have a 15% restocking fee - WOW. It appears that I will be out $250 for this overall bad experience.

The company does not support the USA. They offer other countries things that we are unable to get, and when we have trouble, they say we have to pay to play. The customer support is in Columbia, the country. They just keep reading off the script that they were given. The Vive Pro is a bad investment. HTC does not make good phones either.

At first I had buyers remorse because I spent nearly 2k on this vr setup (not including the computer). I also got the wireless adaptor for this headset and it hooked up easily. The instructions are so ""simple"" that I almost couldn't figure them out. After about an hour of setting everything up. I ended up with the trackers being on opposite sides of my room. So that it could get a 360 coverage better. Also o e thing to note is that mirrors of any kind need to either be removed or covered with something because it causes the tracking to go nutz. I then got all my games from steam. And fired up there steam vr client app. Witch brings you to a room so you can pop in and out of any vr game. So far this headset has been perfect. I have almost 14 hours in it. Since I have the wireless setup, it needs a battery pack to power it. The one HTC provides is something around 20wh witch will not last for more than 3-4 hours of play time. I already have a 100wh battery bank but I soon realized it would not work because it doesn't have quick charger 3.0. For some reason qc 3.0 only works with the headset. I will update this review if anything comes up. So far it's been the best experience ever!

Was on the fence for a while due to the reviews suggesting this headset is not worth the upgrade but eventually decided to try it out.I had the original Vive for two years, I upgraded the original strap and I loved using it, but was hoping for a better picture quality as well as an upgrade in comfort. the Vive pro headset only is obviously not cheap, but it delivers on image quality and comfort in a big way. it made me enthusiastic about using VR again, being able to stay in it for longer periods and enjoying the experience on almost every level.It took me about 15 minutes to connect, download, install and pair with my existing controllers and sensors and it's just an amazing VR system. the only downside for me is the headphones, they are not terrible but they are not worthy of the Vive pro experience.All in all, it's fantastic upgrade, you will still not be able to watch movies comfortably in it, but it will make your older VR set feel as a thing of the past.If you are looking to upgrade or looking to start with VR, I think you should no longer consider the classic set, which was amazing when it came out, but not even close to what this new generation experience has to offer. it's like suggesting to buy a standard definition TV when HD is widely available.

I kept going back and forth with my husband on which VR to get. We chose this one mostly because it was the only one available at the time, but also because we looked it up on YouTube and a lot of people were recommending it.It took a little longer than expected to receive this item, probably because of COVID-19. However, we received it still in reasonable timing, and we have no regrets. Yes, it's a little pricey.. especially when you can go get the Oculus or the PSVR for way less. But let me say this, you get what you pay for in VR. Meaning, the quality is so much better in the HTC Vive than the Oculus or PS VR. I can say this because I have both. The game options are endless on PC versus the PlayStation. The controllers on the HTC Vive are comfortable and very responsive. It comes with two base stations, and when you're setting up the VR it asks you to set boundaries. Basically what it wants you to do is to take a controller and walk around the room to let it know when to inform you that you're too close to something. So say you walk into a square, and you put the headset on... If you walk too close to your refrigerator, there will be a wall that shows up in the VR to let you know not to go past that point or you're going to run into something. Lol unfortunately, there's no way for it to know where the ceiling is so be careful on that. If you have the option, I recommend a room with high ceilings, as my husband has already destroyed a light fixture while playing Beatsaber. LolThe only complaint with the HTC Vive is when you want to add add-ons. That's when it becomes a little bit more tricky and frustrating. For example, the wireless option... The HTC Vive has the option for wireless play, by buying a wireless adapter and installing it. Which is actually rather easy to do. However, it doesn't work as expected. So if you're wanting this VR because of the wireless option, just know that it's not very solid. It is beneficial for some games to have wireless, but your sacrificing quality for it. The battery life on the wireless is awful, and it'll occasionally cut out in the middle of your game which will throw you off your balance when you're in the middle of a gunfight and the whole screen goes black. Lol So just keep that in mind when buying VR. If you're buying it for the accessories, definitely look up reviews on said accessories.Other than that, we are very pleased with our VR. As you all know, it is expensive. But I promise you, you're going to have a blast with it. Just make sure before buying it, that you're going to play it enough to be worth the money. The quality itself is worth the money, but what really makes it worth it is how much you use it. Don't buy VR if you're only going to play it a couple times. If that's the case, go to a friend's house who has one.Another thing that I would like to point out is the physical sensation of being in this VR. What I mean is, a lot of VRs, especially when they first came out... Had a bunch of warnings about possible seizures, and other things that could happen because of the VR. For example, losing your balance or getting lightheaded or motion sickness... It happens. But, this VR is by far the most comfortable one that I've worn, and the least likely one to get me sick or to throw me off balance. I have played this VR for about 45 minutes at a time, Max. And I have yet to have any issues with dizziness or nausea, seizures, whatever it is. Where I can't say the same thing about the PSVR or the Oculus. The PSVR, is notorious for making people dizzy and nauseous (motion sickness). Even if you're only playing it for 15 minutes. That is a huge difference in the two VRs. So definitely keep that in mind when you're trying to justify the cost. It's going to be much more comfortable, and you're going to last longer in VR than you would in a cheaper headset.One last thing that I would Life to point out is the quality of the speakers on the headset. Unlike the PSVR, the HTC Vive Pro has speakers built into the headset. You can either have them up and away from your ear so you can hear other people and the game, or you can have them against your ear so that all your hearing is the game. They can get very loud, and they're actually really good quality speakers. You don't need another headset while using this VR. Just use the headset that it comes with, because it's good enough.

I love VR, and this is the best headset you can get right now, but there are a few negatives I wish I'd known before I made the purchase.On the positive side, the video is definitely a noticeable upgrade over the regular Vive.  The audio is very good, and the headset is very comfortable.On the negative side, the cord is a different design, and is much more difficult to ""uncrimp"", if you play games that have you spinning a lot, the cord will likely become very damaged, need to be untangled more often than on the original Vive, and ""may"" break. (Mine hasn't broken yet, but it looks terrible and I'd imagine it's just a matter of time).The cord cannot be extended after the link box.  It's still long, but definitely a bit more limiting than the original Vive.  While there's a wireless setup, there's an add on required for the Pro that is currently back ordered for at least a month.The headset is also a bit more finicky than the original Vive when it comes to SteamVR.  There are apps that I cannot have open when I try and start SteamVR or it wont work, apps that I can have open with the original Vive (some common examples are Teamviewer, and f.lux), if I do forget to close one of these apps, I need to turn off the power on the Vive Pro link box, and turn it back on before SteamVR will work again.  Hopefully these issues will be fixed someday, but, it's been a problem for 6 months and they still haven't.The base stations have more of an issue with reflections than the original ones, picture frames or windows (even at night) will cause issues if not covered up.I use this headset every day, and I love it, but there's still a lot of work that needs done.

So, I finally broke down and bought one of these. There are a lot of pros, the experience is good the sound is good everything is fantastic. My only complaint is if your eyes are not centered precisely when this is on it’s blurry. There are circles that start just outside of the center of the screen and if you’re moving around and the headset slides a little bit things become blurry. That’s frustrating because this thing is not cheap. I could’ve went with a cheaper version of the five or the oculus but believe VR is up-and-coming and an exploding platform. That said, if you’re going to spend the money by the best. So far no real complaints. I have the wireless battery pack and that is definitely not worth it. The pack only lasts about an hour and a half to two hours and there is no warning when it quits. There is only one wire that goes to the computer and quite frankly after playing several different types of games there was really no reason to have the battery pack. You don’t really move around all that much.

I got rid of my Oculus Rift to upgrade to this headset.I had no issue with the set-up mounting the 2 lighthouses at 180deg at 6'6"" off the floor. Set-up-smooth ran and caused me no problem. the only thing is they say in the instructions that the lighthouses lights should turn white. That is wrong, they should turn green if they are good.The headset is crisp and I can read text inside VR. Screen-dooring was a minimum and games, movies and even the desktop look fantastic.The built in speakers are crisp and clean, if a little light on the bass.Tracking is excellent and very precise, in a 9'X7' use area. They claim mm precision, and I have no reason to doubt that claim.My only issue and why I give it 4 stars is the controllers are really not good. Smooth-motion is a far cry from the Oculus touch. They are big and holding them really needs a bigger hand, I end up having to put my middle finger over the trigger to 'choke up' enough to use the track pads. The tack pads themselves are not very precise so in game movement can get all over the place, but with practice it does get better.  The good news is the =next gen controllers, the knuckles should be coming soon and I can get rid of these batons.

Credit where due: when it works, it's fun. Light years from a great VR experience, but I don't think a great VR experience exists in the world yet.My main complaint is that one of the base stations simply stopped working out of nowhere and HTC straight up won't sell replacements. They don't sell 2.0 base stations. At all. Like, what? How can you sell a product, especially one that breaks easier than an egg shell, and not sell any replacements whatsoever? The only options I have are 1) buying another full setup for a thousand dollars, 2) spending $300 to downgrade to two 1.0 base stations, or 3) mailing the broken base station to them and waiting for a month (yes they told me a month) to get it mailed back.Other complaints: - Only some types of games/experiences work if you're using the cable headset. The cable is annoying and honestly the Vive shouldn't even exist unless it's all wireless. They have a $300 wireless extension you can buy, which should be considered mandatory and therefore you can assume your system will cost an additional $300. - Still heavy and clunky feeling while wearing it. Far too heavy to be particularly agile, can twist around on your head fairly easily if you play a game that moves at all, mainly due to it being too heavy. - Exacerbated by the fact that it moves around on you head, the way the lenses work is godawful... you need to look directly into the center of the glass in order to not have your entire vision blurred, so when you try to look even slightly into your peripheral vision all you see is blurred nonsense. Kind of defeats the purpose of having a high definition display if your lens is obscuring the majority of those extra pixels you paid so much for... - SteamVR software that runs the whole show is buggy, slow, needs to be restarted frequently, and overall seems like it's the very first prototype that worked when the engineers were first experimenting with a VR system, rather than an actual product that is sold to customers. To add insult to injury, I have to look at big popup advertisements from Steam every time I start the SteamVR program, when all I want to do is turn on my VR system and use it. - Customer support is only available by online chat, not phone, which means responses are much slower and you typically just get generic responses that don't help solve anything. Personally I actually think it's fine to have practically zero customer support, but only if you have a self-serve system that actually works, such as having products that rarely break and having ability to order replacements if things do break.

What else is there to say about VR...it's absolutely AMAZING!

I had tried some VR back in the early 90s, but this is far and beyond that.  Also, check out YouTube videos (like I did) and you will see that HTC's Vive is the way to go.  It is expensive, but well worth the price.  My mother of 75 absolutely loved it...with her heart condition and other health issues, she can't ride roller coasters for instance, but I was able to let her ride one from Six Flags.  There is also quite a bit of free content for the Vive via Steam today (and that is another plus for the Vive...it's linked to Steam).  You can be guaranteed that since you are adding content via Steam, that it will still be around in the event you change to another Steam supported VR platform...I've been burned by other companies having their own software platforms and then going bankrupt, but I think we can assume that Steam is here to stay for a while.:)

So, I got this to help me with some virtual reality media creation. Particularly for the Eye Tracking as, AS FAR AS I AM AWARE, the Valve Index does not have a modification that allows for eye tracking on it (which I would prefer to use as it allows for an 80hz refresh rate compared to the 90hz on the VPE)Quick review:Eye Tracking - GreatFace Tracking Addon - Horrible mounting solution, falls off constantly for me. Whoever designed this, well... they did their best but its still horrible.Screen - OLED is great, little bit of initial screen door but it goes away quickly.FOV - Low. Way too low.Audio - Literally the worst audio I've heard, both mic and output. Mic sounds like i'm talking through a static receiver half a room away. Which, you know, at first i did go to check if i had the wrong input selected, but nope. It's just bad. Pick up a modmic or something.Anyways. I'd prefer to see some of the features of this headset like eye tracking and such in something better, like an index. That's all.

Being using original Vive since May 2016. Almost exclusively with prescribed lenses because my eyesight is not so good. So all this time I could really see the screen door effect of the original Vive. It was nearly impossible for me to 'forget' about it, only briefly during some dark scenes. But! With the Pro model SDE is much much less noticeable, text is much much more readable. I can finally almost forget about SDE and just keep playing or watching movies on the Big Screen.Enhanced comfort is not something to be frown upon. There are three major points here: finally I can wear my glasses with absolutely no discomfort and no lens scratching on the tightest dial. It's way lighter (especially then the first version of the original Vive) and it sits tighter and doesn't wiggle on your face.Pros:- Much less noticeable SDE (still visible though)- Text became readable even on 1.3 SS- Giant leap in a comfort. It's lighter and sits tighter- Cable is lighter. But a proprietary port makes it difficult to extend - not a problem for me though, the length is absolutely sufficientCons:- Price is high for just HMD- Plastic is somewhat more crackier then original Vive. Not a big deal, but I like sturdy thingsSome people find headphones not OK. But I could hear any difference between OG and Pro headphones.

So as for me I’m a dcs pilot the thing I hated from the older vive was not been able to read the dials well the pro took care of that is it worth it? Well it depends for me it was. It’s kinda like it cost to be the boss type thing and I don’t regret the pro in the beginning I thought it was not worth it only seen it was a little sharper but enough to read that’s overclocking my 1080 ti but after a day with it I fell in love with it not just the sharpness but the color and the best thing if all the lightness a lot of weight came off the front so now you can play longer and more comfortable I did have one problem the head set one earphone was not working but amazon took care of me and send me another Vive Pro the next day very happy with the product and the service that amazon offers would I recommend this well that depends if your willing to spend 800 dollars but other than that I do recommend it to everyone no question one more thing to add the head set has nice quality sound and it makes it real easy to put on the head set and earphones literally takes about 6 seconds to put on

I have owned the PS VR, original Vive, Oculus, and Vive Pro, so I can compare them all. Yes, the Vive Pro is expensive, but if you can afford it, the Pro is worth it and beats all the rest. You may want a faster CPU and GPU to fully power this beast so you can increase the super-sampling for games like Skyrim VR. That said, the sharper graphics for a fully modded and fine-tuned Skyrim are awe-inspiring! The screen door effect is substantially reduced increasing immersion. Those that don't notice a difference haven't done the work to mod the game.The comfort of this headset cannot be understated compared to the original Vive. It's similar to the Deluxe headgear of the original Vive, but a bit better. It's far easier to put on and adjust, which is great for newbies who come over and want to try VR for the first time. The headphones had a problem with poor bass, but once I installed the updated Vive drivers and de-checked the reduce gain box in the Steam VR settings, the sound fidelity becomes clear and loud. I now have no desire to replace the headphones with something else. Rumbling thunder, music, and rolling boulders all sound great. I also installed a 3D sound mod for Skyrim and get life-like, directional sound that is both immersive and highly useful.I recommend suspending the wire from the ceiling using a kit on Amazon until they come out with the wireless add-on for the Pro. Combine this with the Locomotion app on steam, a fan to give you a nice breeze, and you'll want to jog around Skyrim for hours and never leave. Seeing the northern lights and two giant moons suspended over a gorgeous waterfall and castle atop a mountain is a surreal experience that is beyond words.

TL;DR; - 1x controller dead on arrival, very poor customer service, still waiting on a refund nearly 3 weeks after confirmed receipt at Amazon Warehouse!---After receiving the product and paying very expensive shipping to Hong Kong, while it was noted as ""Used"" I let the initial impressions of a bad smelling device (musty smell) go, and get down to seeing how the device actually performed.Getting everything installed was OK, but once in VR, it was noted that one of the controllers wasn't working properly - either as though the home button was jammed on, or the battery wasn't holding charge. Contacted the seller who offered ""$75 for a repair"" of the item. It was visible on that specific controller that the device had been opened before. This was the state that it ARRIVED in.

This headset is strictly better that the non-pro headset. Yes, graphics are way sharper,  but there are several improvements like: volume control is on headset, unit fits to your face and secures with slide over back of head, there’s a tightening knob that gets the fit just right, and best of all the weight distribution is so much better, it looks and feels so MUCH better! Older non-pro headset pulled on my face over time, I had to snug it so tight to keep it from slipping that my face would have imprints—this issue is completely resolved! So, yes the graphics are gorgeous— but don’t underestimate the value of proper fit! If you VR more than 20 minutes at a time, this headset is totally worth the extra bucks.

Great the 3 times I used it. It was kept in its original packaging when not in use... this thing looks and feels brand new and yet the fourth time I took it out of its box it no longer works! The screen just has snow (like the old TVs would have). I tried unplugging the cable and plugging it back into the headset but still just snow. Not sure if the cable is somehow malfunctioning or if it’s the port itself or whether there is some other unseen problem causing it. HTC does not make it easy to contact them regarding the the warranty as they only advise that I contact the retailer that I purchased it from to start the warranty process. However Amazon does not give me the option to contact the retailer when I pull up my order history. They only give a link for the HTC support library which it notes is “offered by HTC” but the HTC support library doesn’t give anyway to contact them about the warranty. Plus I am suppose to the contact the retailer according to the warranty documents! A 1,000 dollar device and virtually no real support from the manufacturer from opening the box to the time it stopped working! Don’t waste your money! I doubt HTC will honor my warranty!

Needless to say the AM3 platform with a Phenom II X4 955 wasnt cutting it.

Excellent headset and definitely a top tier device. Tracking is not an issue here between the base station and eye tracking. Controllers may take some getting used to if you're switching from valve index, Oculus, or upgrading from one of the vive cosmos headsets. Battery life for controllers are great.

There are also attachments that can be purchased such as a wireless adapter alternate facemask head rests etc. Great purchase for those who are brave to try and for those looking for the next step up in vr.

This is my first venture into VR, and in general I find my self frequently oscillating between being very impressed and very disappointed.This gear is well made, well throughout, comfortable, and tracks very well. That said this kit is take a bit of knowledge and effort to get working well.Aside from this gear, VR overall is still super immature. There are not that many good/finished/polished games, the pixel density on all of the headsets is to low, it is easy to get motion sick, and there is no eye tracking.Realistically it is going to take at least a few more years for the hardware and software to get to the point where it is actually easy, immersive, and fun.

So i've had the VIVE Pro for about a month now and I have to say, for me, it was worth the price to upgrade from the original.I have had the original VIVE since launch. I will say that because of the comfort increase, I have started using the vive MUCH more than I used to. Not only that but setting up the light houses was quite a bit easier as you no longer need the long 20 ft cable connecting the light houses that used to be required.The only reason i'm not giving the VIVE Pro 5 stars is because of the price. Like I said, it was worth the upgrade because i am using it a fair amount more, and I get good worthwhile use out of it. But, given the small upgrades in comfort and display/set up - I don't think those things justify the cost. The VIVE Pro should be the default vive package and should be priced accordingly. It feels like a more consumer friendly product overall. I don't think many people will consider it a good buy at this price point, and unless you have some extra money to burn I would recommend getting the original vive and just purchasing the aftermarket head strap/built in speakers.The only negative thing outside of price I have to say is the quality on the headphones isnt' as good as my normal headphones i use on my PC. The fact that you can't easily replace them via an audio jack is disappointing and an oversight in my opinion.  While not a deal breaker, it just lowers an experience that was elevated in every other regard.

Purchased the Vive PRO.  To date, have had a base station fail.  Rest of the hardware has operated without issues.  However, the software side is poor to say the least.  Numerous issues with the sound quality with the Vive Pro.  None of the answers available online are a permanent solution.  Therefore, your nice $1200 headset with sub-par controllers tends to be more annoying when solving sound issues than ""fun"".I've spent more time troubleshooting this device for my family to where I don't have any interest in touching it myself.  The audio issues make it a complete pain in the ass.  What's worse is, these issues have been reported for quite some time without any improvement to the sound quality and reliability.For a premium home product, it's barely worth 2 stars for the frustration it's caused.

For this headset I have no issue with motion sickness.I was a little disappointed that the set did not come with the wireless adapter (thats is extra $$).I did try PS4VR and it just simply is not comparable quality wise. PS4VR is a lot cheaper, however does not do room scale tracking, and gave me motion sickness on same game I would play on the Vive Pro. It should be noted that we have plenty of space at home and we track at least a 6ft x 5ft area for play and run on a NVIDIA 1070 Ti graphics card with other beefed up components.Some people mention tracking issues, for me I never had any issue with tracking playing a well constructed game. It should be noted that I set my Vive Pro up in a theater room with dark walls and no reflective surface or open windows.All in all a very solid VR system. I would recommend to anyone with a disposable income and enough space to get the benefits out of the room tracking system.

The VR form the HTC Vive Pro is probably great, I don't know yet. During the initial setup I noticed that one of the base stations was making an annoying whining sound. Contacted HTC Vive support via chat and was told that I would need to send in the defective unit. However, I was told that I would have to cover the cost of shipping. HTC only reimburses shipping cost if their support staff determines that the unit was indeed defective. How does HTC define the word defective? Will they say that I opened the box like an idiot and blame me for the damage? I have already spent alot of money on this and they assume I will continue to pay, which is true and is most likely the reason they get away it.  At this point I don't even know if I want to finish the setup, I don't know if the rest of it is broken too. Maybe I'll use the Vive Pro to virtually weigh down papers. Maybe virtual reality is just as good with one base station, I doubt it.I will update this review in fifteen days or so, when my repaired base station is returned.For HTC, if you find this review to be defective and feel that it should have been a five star review. Please send your defective review to me via the post. If I deem the review to be defective, I will reimburse the shipping cost and return an amended review.

not the most stunning quality but unlike the valve index, this does not disintegrate off your face nearly as often. It was a bit of a hassle for me to order this as the delivery was all over the place but it got here.anyway, it works flawlessly, except for the vive wands which have crappy trackpads, make sure to order index controllers to get that issue resolved.

I knew I liked VR and I knew I wanted to dive into the world of VR gaming. By spending this much money on a gaming device ensured I would give it many tries to impress, and it has. Sometimes you have to stop and take a break, but VR has so many features to it and cool games. Why not splurge on getting the greatest quality device thats on the market? If you can afford it, get it.

No complaints aside from the fact that one of the controllers' grip button clicks weird and makes a creaking sound. I can probably fix this if i open up the controller but still. I've had other issues like gray screens and so on which turned out to be USB problems with my PC that i fixed by somehow plugging most of my peripherals into a USB 3.0 hub or two. Eye tracking also works fine but it bugged out again due to USB issues that i later resolved.Bought new if that matters.

It is a lot clearer. The screen door has been minimalized greatly. The Red Green Blue around the pixels has been diminished as well. Still not as clear as I had hoped. It's pretty much what I expected the Vive 1.0 to be when I bought it. I understand that hardware needs to catch up before they can come out with a better quality picture, but it is way better than the Vive 1.0 by far. All in all I am happy I bought it. Mostly the new ergonomic design is far superior I think. The only flaw I see is they should have made the headphones spring loaded to cup the ear tighter. I would recommend this over the Vive 1.0 or the Oculus Rift by far. It takes away most of everything I was disappointed in with both of them VR sets when I tried VR for the first time.

If you're looking for the best looking VR Experiences, this is as good as it gets for the next few years; however, make sure to bring your own audio device, as the built in speakers have issues, ESPECIALLY with the wireless adapter.  Wired, they sound all right via NVidia audio, but crackle and pop via HTC vive multimedia or HTC audio.  The pro is a huge bandwidth hog, so for those looking to supersample at the high end, you're going to be stuck with the wire; the wireless causes crashing.  Overall, the Pro is like Nvidia's RTX series in the sense that it is the best that one can buy, but it's overpriced for what you're getting.

The nob on the back of the head strap can make it uncomfortable to lay down with. 95% of the time, this is not a problem. VRchat is the only time I lay or sit in VR.Definitely an upgrade from the OG vive.I've also experienced some bugs with the microphone and headphones on the VR headset itself.Since the earphones can be removed this is not a major issue.

Being a owner of a previous HTC Vive I can say this is a pretty decent step forward in both comfort and quality. The screen isn't a massive upgrade over the previous Vive but it does increase the clarity mainly with text and image sharpness as others have stated. The screen door effect has been noticeably reduced by the resolution as well.For the straps It has a nob on the back which adjust the horizontal tightness of the headphones while the vertical tightness is adjusted by a single strap and the cushion on the back is pretty comfortable.Now for my verdict on the headphones. They sound good (they do not have an overwhelming bass and the mids and highs are decent which I like) this is coming from someone on a HD 700 that's plugged into a high end amplifier from Burson audio (tldr together over $1200 headphone sound system.)Lastly for those who wish to know I'm on a i7-4790k and a GTX 1080 (not a Ti) and it pushes this fine without issues.All of this being said it's easily worth the $800 price tag that's on this system. It might take some work setting it up at first as mine gave me some trouble. However now that it is setup I absolutely love it. If you wish to go straight to the Pro I recommend the bundle rather than buying the regular Vive and then the Vive Pro since you will get the gen 2 accessories. Also if you need help with the setup or have some questions feel free to ask.

Overall I'm loving the Vive and VR in general. Most of my friends have had little to no issues with it either. It's fun to play with as a group in challenges or just watching someone else try to succeed in a game.The only drawback so far has been HTC themselves. One of the lighthouses went flashing red after two weeks of use. HTC confirmed it's a known issue. Only repair option is to mail it in. This can take 4+ weeks. Meanwhile you're stuck to seated games or a 1400 dollar paperweight. Fortunately Amazon was able to ship a replacement, but it's a whole kit. HTC is losing a ton more money this way but they don't seem to care about that.

From my experience with other headsets, I can say this is definetly the best performance vr headset in the market. The early adopter tax is high on this one, however if you are looking for the best immersion experience (responsiveness and resolution) today, you shouldn’t look further. I just hope they could develop something to fix the dizziness that comes from your inner ear not receiving the same input as your eyes, It really shortens the amount of time you can spend on each session.

if you're going to purchase a vive then just buy the pro's bundle, it's more expensive but it's refundable, so if for any reason you are not satisfied you can just return it and get your money back. the normal vive is not refundable.actual review:the pro headset is very comfortable and adjustable even with glasses it fits nicely onto my head, the quality seems good (i can't really tell much of a difference between the vive), and the headphones are decent quality.it would be nice if the headphones were a bit better quality, a bit bigger, and extended a bit further down.

Using this to play games on SteamVR. The motion tracking and response to head rotation and the controllers is extremely good, completely seamless. Setup wasn't too hard.

Once you get your tracking bases set up, and you get everything plugged in, and you finally turn the thing on and play some of the games you've downloaded, you'll be thrilled. That is, as long as you have a decent PC. If you don't, the best headset in the world isn't going to to anything for you.I enjoy the hell out of it.

If you're getting it for the resolution, it's better for reading text at normal size, which is great for virtual desktop, but the improvement is only subconsciously noticeable in games.  The headset is more weight balanced and better quality.  A downside is when you move your eyes, the peripheral seems more blurry than the original.

Warning! Check your settings in steamVR!! anything below a 1080ti is getting down sampled on the pro! So it will not look as sharp as it should! If you have a good cpu and a 1080ti crank that global supersample setting up to 170% and up (depending on the game) (the Pro also has a firmware glitch causing low bass via the headphones and this is confirmed via htc. A patch should be coming out soonish. So don't evaluate the headphones too much yet). I have a 1080ti and immediately noticed how much farther i can see, it's got a nice crispness that VR sorely needed. at this point we are literally pushing the graphical power of modern consumer tech, this is the best you will get for now.All in all as a previous OG Vive owner, i am enjoying it thoroughly. And the time i will spend in it justifies the price for me personally.Welp i had saved up a bit in anticipation of the pro's launch. (Thanks amazon for the 100$ gift card i had lying around from a previous deal). It is everything i wanted it to be. i can really push the clarity with that supersampling.. like wow i can actually see 10 feet away clearly in steam vr home. No more teleporting up to the tv. Onward is amazing now, those far maps? You'll spot that head poking out now. Do VR graffiti? The paint looks so much crisper, really helps get your thin lining up better. Like sim games? Racing and flying sim users will love this added clarity. The price was... pretty high. But it's my hobby and i have no regrets. Really glad i jumped the gun.I love it so far. I love tech and i love playing with the high end gadgets. If you just want to dabble in vr look at the OG Vive, it's still an amazing headset. If you got some money to blow, then get the pro. It really comes down to personal value and i believe everyone's opinion matters on the subject. For some it is worth it and for others it won't be. Really depends on how much vr gaming you do.The headset is very comfortable, i can not emphasize the need to get it placed right. But once you do it is amazing.

I received the Vive Pro kit on May 10th. I was super excited to try it out as this was my first VR system. Unfortunately, one of the 2.0 base stations was dead upon arrival. I contacted HTC support and after 2 hours of troubleshooting they deemed the base station faulty. They then recommended that I return the kit.I have since begun the process of returning the kit for a replacement and it has gone smoothly. I expect to receive a new kit within the week. It sucks to have to pay so much for this kit and an essential part of the system to be dead on arrival. However, it may have been an oddity.Also HTC needs to update their installer for this kit. The installer has the Vive Pro headset in the installer. It didn't change the trackers which do not have channel indicators and it didn't update the LED light identifiers.Overall I had a blast for my first VR experience. It's a shame that I have to spend so long without it.Update: I have recieved my new Vive Pro as of 5/17/18 and all of the components are fully working. I'm very glad that Amazon's returns are extremely prompt and very easy to do.

Screen door is gone. All but the smallest text is readable. Feels roughly equivalent to a 1080p monitor. Seems to seal out the light better. The thinner, lighter cable is nice. Running a GTX 1080.It doesn't have an on-board peripheral USB port like the original VIVE did, so USB mods (fans, etc.) won't work without additional cabling. There is a button on the headset, opposite of the volume buttons, that has a funny symbol but I have no idea what it does. It doesn't appear to be documented anywhere.Edit: one USB c port is hidden next to the cable under the foam.

I'm writing this as someone who already had a totally modded up normal HTC Vive and then bought the Pro.  I tried all the games I am playing, Elite, Skrim also tried VR movies and the steam games like the Valve laboratory. The audio is great.  Google VR with comfort mode turned off it pretty damn awesome. The video/resolution is of course much better.  The new weight and headset balance is fantastic.  Cameras are awesome.  Snug fit, no light and very very comfortable.  I had the better headset and foam face pieces previously on my old non pro vive and this is still a huge improvement in every way. Rating it based on how much software is available or if you really don't like VR anyway seems a bit besides the point.  There is no better headset out there.  It is the best basically.  Yes have a good machine but have a good machine in general or get a different hobby. Don't like paying top dollar? Then don't buy top quality.

I purchased this as an upgrade/replacement for my original Vive that broke slightly over the return time. I play Beat Saber quite frequently and sweat a lot (this is the nature of VR games). During a stream of regular use, the headset began to lose tracking to the point where I could no longer play the game. This was caused by the lax construction of this product. I have had this headset for 1 week.Pros: increased resolution is pretty nice, and the clearer lenses are also pretty nice.Cons: it will break. It's just a matter of time. It. WILL. break.Something of note is that the components of this headset, while indeed inside the headset and protected my the headset cover, the components are exposed inside the headset and prone to perspiration damage. Strangely enough, HTC has removed ""perspiration damage"" from the warranty as a seemingly blatant and shady acknowledgement of the flawed construction of this product. DO NOT buy this headset.

The screen clarity IS marginally better, but not so much as to charge twice the price and not include the controllers or base stations. But the real reason for the lack of stars is that the vive pro would begin resetting itself after about 15 minutes of play. I'm assuming it's a heat management issue as the headset felt pretty warm in places when this happened. It always came back on after a few seconds, but the flash to black is SO disruptive in a VR environment that it makes the headset unusable. I wound up returning mine due to that issue. I have stayed immersed with the original vive for an hour or more without it overheating.

It took me several days to write this review as I waited for the Micro Display port to Micro Display port adapter that I needed for my laptop.  I started off a bit irked about dropping the HDMI support, but I can't so much hold that against the company seeing as I should have read the specs a bit more carefully.  First and foremost though, this does provide fantastic clarity through the HMD.  I had reduced the overlay super sampling on my Steam Dashboard to 0.7 in order to allow me to raise some super sampling on other games.  The trade off on the original Vive was fuzzy screen quality when selecting my games, which wasn't a big deal.  When I (finally) got the Vive Pro up and running, I thought my settings had reverted as it was as clear as the unaltered super sampling, if not more so!  So...if your only concern is image quality and you will handle everything else, there you go.  As for the downsides, there are several.  The headphones are junk, they pop and crackle like a set of $20 wal-mart bargain binners, they are mounted to the headset in such a way that you can't get them -just right- on your ears, and where they are it actually hinders putting on a good set.  On the bright side, they are so flimsy I can just break them off.  As for the rest of the headset...HTC, how did you screw this up?  The overall pressure equalization is great!  However, the screw that ratchets down the rear part of the head band is trash...you can't get it particularly tight as it simply slides free.  The extra padding on the rear was a good idea, but the thickness of it causes extreme sweating.  I was able to spend hours in the original vive and barely steam the mask, in just a half hour in this even on non-strenuous games I am having to hop out and wipe my forehead to keep from soaking the lenses.  The field of vision was great on the original Vive, even if the god rays from those lenses were annoying.  However, the silly little nose piece on this one actually blocks my view, leaving a solid little bar right between my eyes.  Oh and a final note...the head phones, good luck with those.  They simply stopped working even though my computer saw them and showed it was pushing sound to them.  Turn off the link box, turn it back on, headphones work, start Steam, headphones stop.  I finally found out that turning the link box off after starting steam, then turning it back on made them work until I restarted Steam.  Seriously HTC, you are charging 800 dollars for this and I will have to spend another 200 at least to make it a decent product.  You all should be ashamed of yourselves, everyone that is wanting to buy this thing, don't.  Buy the original headset, it is far superior in everything except the display and costs almost half the price.  If you are dead set on getting it for the wireless capability in the future, just have some hardware experience or wait for the posters to start putting up instructions on how to fix this piece of junk.

This is my first low rating on Amazon.  I was super excited about this upgrade from the HTC Vive to the Vive Pro.  A lot of reviews stated that it was an nice improvement but not earth-shaking.  I decided to go for it the day before they were planning to start shipping them.  I ordered through Amazon on 4 Apr.  I got an email stating that the delivery date would be between 1 May to 16 May, so I decided to be patient and not worry about it.  In a few days, I got an update that moved the delivery date to 18 Apr!  I then started to get excited because it was almost a month early.  I got another update that said it would be delivered on Sunday, 15 Apr and would be there before 8:00 PM!  I was now really looking forward to trying out the new headset and replacing my older one.  As you can see, the buildup and anticipation had me looking forward to its early delivery.  It showed up around 1:00 on Sunday and I had nothing else to do that day but to get this new VR headset working and I was jazzed!  Amazon exceeded my expectations in every way up until the point where I started opening the package.  I could tell that something was not quite right but I remained optimistic.  It was packaged as a box within a box within a box.  Still everything was ok but I noticed that it looked like it had been repackaged, almost as if someone else already had it and sent it back.  There was scotch tape holding the USB and DisplayPort cables together and other small details that looked like it may not be brand new.  There were also no detailed instructions but I figured those could be referenced on-line.  I loaded updated video card drivers and hooked up the link box and headset.  My system would not recognize the headset and I had Error 208.  I researched everything I could and did everything the forums said to do to troubleshoot the error to no avail.  I then started a chat session with HTC support.  The girl was very friendly and ran me through a gambit of diagnostics.  She finally determined that the headset was defective and said that I would have to return it through Amazon since that is where I purchased it.  I was super bummed because there is a 1 to 2 month wait for this item and now I would have to start the process all over again.  I had to repackage it and go through the return process with Amazon.  I am not sure I want to re-order it because of this unfortunate experience.  I would warn anyone ordering this item to hold off until they work out the issues.  I am a deeply disappointed customer due to the fact that I got a defective unit and that there was no way to get a replacement in a reasonable amount of time.  Thanks for reading and I hope you don't suffer a similar fate.

Oh for crying out loud... base station is REQUIRED to use the thing and it doesn't come with one. As a first time buyer of the product there was NOTHING obvious on the description that the thing required extra accessories to function. All dressed up and no way to play until i figure out hwo to get the accessories separately./ Always have to watch for that (missing) fine print. Had i dug more into reviews i would have known to wait for the full package.

I am very disappointed, either there is something wrong with this one or I IDK. Everything I read said this was the best resolution ?? It is bad really bad.

I got this thinking it would be a huge improvement over the original vive. Its not.  Its an upgrade, but not significant.  I can still every single dot and pixel.  Yes its more clear and some higher resolution but its nothing leaps and bounds.  It really hurts my head too, not sure why, maybe have to play with the adjustments. I think I will wait until VR has reached the next gen.  Right now its fun to experience for a few mins here and there but nothing that I would want t play for hours like a PS4 or PC games.  Has a ways to go before still..  Oh well.

This HMD is amazing, sure its a little on the steep side for pricing but you have to pay to play.  HTC is also very smart to pick this price point because it boots scalpers back onto scalping classic consoles.

The device just arrived today, this review is from a Vive, Oculus, Odyssey user.The packaging it's pretty barebone for its price, I'm not talking about what it is inside but about how everything is packed, probably thats why I received mine with a scratch in the front... First impressions are so and so, when you get the most expensive headset on the market you expect the perfection, it's legit, but it's not the case, the fitting is very very good, the screen resolution imprevement is very very welcome, but the God Rays are very very noticeable. Color and black in the odyssey are better, but amazing screen anyway (probably just a different calibration)Audio I think it has some problem, it totally lack of bass, I tried to reinstall everything, but it's just very weird, will try again with more time, but the included audio and the 360 audio are very very welcome!!Btw I did a video about it, you can check out at YouTube .com/c/Tyrielwood  I don't think I can share the link here. It's my last video so you will be find it no problem.For this price hard to suggest, I will update my review in the future but for now.. it's a no

Not at all worth the price tag. Being $300 more than the original headset, this horrible ripoff does NOT come with controllers or base stations for tracking. There is not a single reason this should be a standalone product, let alone at the price point it is at. Unless you already have the original vive headset, ordering this is pointless. And if you do have one, it's still not worth it for the extra couple pixels this provides. This product has basically no functionality when bought alone, and right now in order to buy controllers and tracking stations on amazon it costs $700 combined, as the only options are third party amazon pages selling controllers for around $350, showing incorrect specs and no pictures. DO NOT BUY.

Pointlessly overpriced garbage.
