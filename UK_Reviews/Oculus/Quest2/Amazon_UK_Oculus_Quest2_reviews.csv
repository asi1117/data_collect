In a time you have toothbrushes with an internet connection we now have data mining goggles.Firstly I have an oculus quest and prior to that an oculus go. I wanted the quest 2 to play the games library I already have in better definition with a better refresh rate and a lighter headset. I have never had any social media accounts. I realised that a facebook account is required for use of the quest 2 (and any new oculus account). I have been unable to set up this as a request to join has been disabled even though I have never posted anything or used the ""service"" - you cannot even link a headset to the app without going through entirely unnecessary reams of GPDR defiling information. Why do you need to know a family members cervical smear result, the cats stool sample, whether I dress to the right or left just to use this headset? This is technology at its worst - I don't expect a radio to decide if I can listen to a song or a home cinema system to decide if I am allowed to watch a film I already own, yet this oculus update renders for me the headset unusable as I cannot register an account - and use an appliance I have paid for and use games I have already paid for. It arrived yesterday I spent 4 hours trying to get the thing to allow me to use it. I have actually binned it as it is unusable, £400 literally thrown away. I will continue to use the inferior Quest 1 on an oculus account (until that is discontinued in 2023). Buyer beware , you are sacrificing God knows what personal information to God knows who for no justifiable reason. You are at the mercy of the data hoarders in this facebook experiment. Please wait until another company produces a stand alone VR set which will allow you the courtesy of using what you have paid for. Entirely unacceptable.

This review will follow the same format as my previous review on the Oculus 2 and comparisons will be made, though I will cater for those who are unfamiliar with the the Quest and / or VR too.My Oculus Quest 2 256gb arrived a few hours ago.  I swore to myself I do my work, though I found myself opening it within half an hour or so and there I was again experiencing the virtual world ironically within a world which is currently in chaos.————————UNBOXING / HEADSETThe box (pictured) comprises of a cellophane wrapped outer sleeve covering a nice looking natural coloured box (pictured) with a liftable lid.  It feel like quality of reminiscent of Mac products.Inside the box, in their own neatly arranged compartments are the headset, the controllers, quick start guide and USB 3 cable and power supply in a small box and a spacer to place on the unit for those who wear glasses.Picking up the headset, I could feel that it was quiet compact - notably smaller to the previous Quest, but this was largely due to the fact that the rigid, rubber head strap has been replaced by a fabric one.  In light of this fact, I actually feel like the Quest 2 resembles that of the Quest Go since this also had a fabric strap.  With that point in mind, the Quest 2 headset (being a smaller unit too) feel like a Go / Quest hybrid.Not only does the headset feel light, but smaller and a lot more easier to handle.  The fabric strap might be seen as a cheaper solution, but I think it’s a much more effective one, especially when factoring in comfort, since it is, without question, a lot more comfortable than the previous Quest.  This is perhaps largely due to the fact that the unit isn’t as heavy.  A heavy headset would demand something more than a fabric strap, so this is something Oculus have managed to escape.There’s an ‘Elite Strap’ available for the Oculus 2 at £49 and I was going to purchase it for delivery with the Quest 2, but having felt how light and comfortable the unit is, I don’t feel any need for this at all.  Perhaps those people who play high paced games might find use for it however.  There’s a version at £119 which offer a battery mounted version to extend battery life (plus a carry case), so I do imagine this to be useful, particularly for those people who play on the move and / or wish to avoid being wired in.EDIT: Having used for hours now, the side bands sometimes saw into the tops of my ears which is a slight irritant, but excusable.The nose bridge of the Quest 2 is considerably tighter and can be felt more, but this comes with the advantage that it block out more light, thus adding to the immersiveness.The colour of the headset (and controllers) isn’t white as I initially assumed - rather a very light grey.  The surround looks white when remove from the box, but this is in fact a paper covering which is removed.Overall the headset, besides feeling compact, has a better feel due to more pleasing curves.  The front is like a rounded bean shape, featuring no level surface area.  The unit is fully plastic ridding of the previous material sides of the previous Quest which gathered grime and sweat.  Similar padding is present however though there is less of the foam in comparison to the original Quest.  The Quest 2 substitutes half of that previous foam with a plastic adjoining the headset and foam.  It’s an improvement to minimise foam, but I feel rubber is best utilised for both its durability and waterproof quality.  I do think that soaking sweat might actually be part of the idea, much like a headband however…The headset features the power button at the right hand side (whilst wearing), the a USB 3 (charging and PC data) at the left hand side together with a 3.5mm jack for headphones.  A volume rocker button features at the bottom right of the unit.———————TOUCH CONTROLLERSHolding the first controller in my hand, I could tell that it too was larger.  Even as a person with large hands, I did question if this size was necessary, especially considering that many suers will have smaller hands than myself.  Nonetheless, it may just be a matter of time in order to get used to them, being accustomed to the smaller Quest controllers.Buttons are further apart and the top face, previously a teardrop shape is now circular and features a place where the user can rest their thumb.As before, we have a ‘Y’ and ‘X’ buttons and thumb controller on each, including an Oculus button to recalibrate and return to the home screen.  There’s also a ‘thumb pad’ in which to rest your thumb on which seems somewhat unnecessary in my eyes - or at least not a good reason to extend the top face.The grip is different in reflection of the size difference and reportedly the triggers are ‘easier to use’ though they feel the same as the Quest to me - good quality and they do the job.The controllers thankfully still take an AA battery in each one and they come installed with one.  Simply slide out the plastic tabs and the batteries make their connection and the controllers are ready to use.  Apparently greater attention was given to ensure that the battery compartment slider doesn’t slide off during frantic gameplay as it supposedly did with the Quest, though this never did happen to me.Most notably in the specs, ‘Haptic Feedback’ is stated as a feature in which the rumble function in the controllers is meant to be more dynamic differentiating between a figurative finger tap in contrast to a clash of swords.  I’m yet to experience a difference here, but reminding myself, I will be more aware of report back.——————STARTING UP ***SPOILERS***Switching on the headset I was greeted with the introduction which shows graphics / animations pertaining to button use and Oculus Guardian setup.  For those unfamiliar with VR, Guardian setup is a virtual line which is draw around the room (with the controller) with the threshold set at point where you might bump into things.At this point, I feel it was at least half of the ‘moment of truth’.  Immediately I was judging the graphics at this point (explained below), but wasn’t overly impressed.After setup I found myself in the default Environment and the first thing I noticed is that the dashboard and everything else is much smaller.  Controls and navigation has changed too and not for the better in my opinion.  I’m sure I will get used to this, but I was just appreciating how good the huge console was on the previous Oculus.The controls are mere symbols now without text, so as a new user you’d have to go by trial and error rather than knowing what you are pressing.  I’d hope there is a setting to make this otherwise.The previous Quest segued into a great little game which demo’ed the systems capabilities after the setup.  It’s a shame that the Quest 2 didn’t do similar, though they may do that in the future.—————IMAGE QUALITYThere are going to be two distinct people with regards to how image will be judged. First there are those who will compare against the Quest and those who will just be amazed as a first time VR user.Some might say that Quest users have already been ‘spoiled’ but it’s still ultimately a matter of how the Quest technology has improved.  So, the burning question is; Did the quality of the image blow me away as a previous Quest user? …..to which the answer is a definite ‘no’.Firstly, the setup screen (mostly white and pastels colours) wasn’t giving me enough imagery to judge, though my opinion still remains the same having ventured in.Next, I observed blur - mostly at the sides and then cam the revelation that the lenses could be adjusted after reading the cardboard tabs I’d removed containing the instruction to do so. There’s a 3 point adjuster in which you grab one (or both) of the tense which move together through a range of 3 positions.The good news is, the lens adjustment did help to relieve a 50% of the blur, but on the other hand, the position of the lenses to which my eyes witnessed this (at the far extremes - right and left) causes black ‘walls’ at either side. Pulling the lenses inwards makes it look like you are looking out of a porthole (as many are used to).So, the ultimatum I have is to have 50% less blur viewing the ‘walls’, or put up with the blur whilst looking through the ‘porthole’.  For now, I’ve chosen the latter.  This may just be a consequence of offering adjustment options (it may be a blessing for some).At the extreme lens settings there was also a notable central glare across all colour backdrops.With that issue aside, to allow fair judgement, I put on my previous Oculus and observed the difference.  The Quest 2 in COMPARISON is notably better, even with the blur issue present.So, I feel that is the conclusion.  Previous Quest users will notice the difference probably not initially but when they do a comparison.  I’m glad I didn’t sell my Quest too too to allow me to do this and appreciate the difference.  Granted, some may notice the difference right off the bat.The Oculus 2, much like the one before it, features 4 cameras on the front of the headset used to track the controllers.  There is also an option to view your real surrounding whilst the virtual graphics are placed on top i.e Augmented Reality.  I was very surprised to discover that despite the potential of AR, they still hadn't brought these cameras up to an acceptable resolutions - only the same poor resolution needed for controller tracking alone.Colours are as vivid as the Quest - rich and pleasing.The Oculus 2 is 1832 x 1920 pixels per eye (50% increase in resolution over the original Quest).EDIT:  Having played for a good few hours now, I can say with confidence that this is a significant improvement in the graphics department....viewing object CLOSE UP.  This here is the clincher for all VR clarity.  The very limit of the graphics are show when you look at things right next to the eyes, sync as holding up a weapon in a game.  I noticed this in a big way when I bought and played Walkabout Mini Golf and viewing the course and it's detail from a birds eyes view.  Absolutely intriguing. Crisp as 4K!There's no question about it, we've reached a level of normal displays where we can beat our our retinas (hence Apples 'Retina' monitor) however we still need that ongoing advancement in technology to make things in the middle / background crisp too!—————SOUNDCrisp, clear and quality.  I did feel that it was better than the Quest sound quality, though it was up full volume whereas I usually listen at half that volume.Still, there seems to be a slight improvement.  Highs, low and midrange are on point, making experiences aurally immersive.I will be experimenting with my Sennheiser 650 headphones soon too.——————APPS & GAMES / PERFORMANCEBeing a new system, the cupboard was bare with regards to downloaded titles, but there was plenty on offer to download besides my older catalogues of games which I was pleased to see.When the Quest launched, there was only around 8 games, so those entering into the Quest 2 scene will do so at a good time since there’s plenty on the store now and there’s a lot of free content to enjoy too.Even in the virtual space, the head tracking is noticeably better.  Even though i noticed no latency with the Quest, there is just a level of quality to the movement which is difficult to describe.  Basically it’s just a greater sense of reality.  I expect this feel to perhaps increase, at least in high speed apps and games when the refresh rate is increased.  Facebook have revealed that it’s currently set at 72Hz yet will be increased up to 90Hz.Before I bought a Quest 2, I asked around YouTube to ask whether my apps and games purchased for the Quest would be carried over to the Quest 2.  This was confirmed on the condition that I linked / merged my Facebook account to my Oculus account, which I did.  As mentioned, all my games was there and I download a good few of them at lightening speed but was gutted to discover that save games are NOT carried over.  I had hopes of continuing my vast progress on Mini Moto Racing X, but this is seemingly not to be.Nonetheless, open opening Mini Moto Racing X and the graphics are notably most crisp and the experience was improved overall.  I found myself glancing around the environment actually delaying the race just to appreciate it (after viewing on the Quest 20 mins previous).  Next I tried out Pistol Whip and put not only the graphics to the text, but also the head tracking which improved the game considerably.  The improvement in the graphics could be seen even from the menu screen and bettered itself as the game continued.One prominent feature of the Quest 2 is its ability to be hooked to a PC.  My only intention is to play independently though I would have tested for the sake of my review, though I’m strictly a Mac user at present due to work.The refresh rate of the Oculus Quest is up to 90HzThe launch refresh rate is 72HzEDIT: Besides my previous games, I’ve bought and played Walkabout Mini Golf and it’s the most realistic thing (besides table tennis) that I’ve witnessed to date.  It feels like a proper game of mini golf.  The physics are absolutely spot on.  I’ve also experience RezInfinite and was blown away, literally saying ‘wow’ - completely unlike me.——————FINAL THOUGHTSAs a previous Quest owner, I’m pleased with my upgrade.  Due to the fact that saved games are not carried over however, I will still be keeping the Quest for now, since I’ll have to play my games on that system.As a conditioned VR user, in light of these ‘walls’ and ‘porthole’ that I mention, I do hope that more focus is placed upon trying to increase the field of view.  I don’t know anything about the technicalities and problems relating to making this happen, but I feel ridding of those ‘sides’ is going to bring immersiveness well into the next level.  What's more, the front cameras could easily be a much better resolution to open upon potential and future proof augmented reality.  As far as I'm aware, those aren't special cameras and cameras in this day an age are not expensive, so to have a VR headset boast AR capabilities too shouldn't be too much to expect.For those entering into VR for the first time, or even from something like the Oculus Go which only tracks a hand movement, there’s probably no better way than to enter in than via the Oculus 2.  You’re getting the full VR experience in which you can roam around a room, you’re getting great visuals and what’s more, you have access to a load of titles, whether it be experiences (apps) or games that you are interested in.If you’re on the move, or like to have many apps and games available to you quickly and easily, you may wish to consider the 256GB version for the extra £100.  Most importantly, if we consider that fact that apps will become larger and larger in file size, it’s a future proof option.  If you are just dipping in your toe as a first time user however the 128GB might serve you fine.As mentioned, I think it’s a ‘quest’ for technology to eventually yield graphics that are as crisp in the middle and background as they are ‘up close’ and I really look forward to that.Virtual Reality is going to become astronomical.  It’s great to be part of its advancement.The Quest 2 is up there with the best hardware in which to currently experience it!——————Advantages* Objects 'up close' are near 4K crisp* Room-scale freedom (as in the original Quest)* PC Connectivity though no PC required* Haptic Feedback (yet to witness)* Vast range of titles on launch* Greater feeling of being in a ‘reality’.* Sharper image with much greater feel of depth* More responsive head tracking* Much more comfortable & easy to fit* Good battery life* Charges quickly enough (approx 2.5 hours)Disadvantages* Front cameras still a poor resolution marring Augmented Reality potential* Lens adjustment results in ‘walls’ at extremes* Lens adjustment results in central glare at inners* Side straps saw into ears* Physical games cause the padding to soak in sweat* Facebook account is required

First off, This device will force you to create a facebook account or link to an existing. All usage goes into facebook systems. Every menu has free or useful content hidden and its all about selling you more.So it could be amazing, but facebook has trashed it. If it loses connectivity to the network or it cant report on you anymore, it fails instantly even on locally running games.What could have been great is a total wasted purchase due to deliberately limited software and facebooks priorities.

For you own sanity don’t buy this product. Unfortunately you have to have a Facebook account and Facebook will actively disabled new accounts. Do KYC - doesn’t matter account gets disabled. I’ve been disabled twice even through I’ve done KYC.Oculus support is useless. The make all the right noises but once you raise a ticket they just pass it onto a Facebook support team member.Next generation VR headsets will come out next year. Just wait and don’t waste your time or money on this product.

Yesterday, I was eagerly standing outside my house waiting for the delivery of my pre-order when I received an email telling me that my package had been handed to me. This was great service because I couldn't even feel the weight of the package and the driver must have been moving so fast that my eyes could not see him.As the product is completely invisible, it is quite hard to plug in. The experience of putting it on is remarkable. The world seems so real and 3D. My entire office shows up just as it is in real life. Games seem to be limited to the normal activities that I perform in my office but with the satisfaction that this is all virtual.I can't see any vignetting or other visual artifacts from the lenses. There does not seem to be any kind of menu system or shop. I can only hope that I am holding the controllers correctly as they are also invisible and too light to feel.Everybody tells me how great I look when I'm wearing it, apart from one annoying kid who says I'm not wearing a headset, he's obviously jealous of my magnificence.

Just received my oculus and have started then cancelled the setup.1st, you need to create a facebook account. this is mandatory2nd, you need to download a special app to your phone, and when launched connect to your new facebook account. It does all it can to mine your info at this stage and try to get you to install the facebook app (beyond horrific if you value privacy) and sign up for this and that.Next, it won't go any further unless you let it know your location. Why? why does it need my geo coordinates to setup the headset?I'm out at this stage. It may be a great product, but i'm not letting facebook farm all my personal info just to use the damn thing.

Up until now my only experience of VR had been PlayStation VR, so I honestly wasn't expecting much from the Oculus Quest 2. I bought my wife the 64Gb version for her birthday and as soon as I tried it I bought myself the 256Gb Quest 2. For the record, I have never before been so impressed by anything that I have made an impulse purchase, so that's a complement to Oculus.If you've never tried VR before or you've only ever experienced the likes of PSVR then this is will blow you away. The full range of motion, being able to walk around and not being held back by a wire is so exciting. Just remember to set your guardian boundaries correctly otherwise you will walk into a wall.Compared to the PSVR the screen door effect is almost non-existent. I'll happily sit and watch Netflix or Prime Video on my Quest 2 and won't notice the SDE. It's still there, but barely.Things I haven't tried so can't yet comment on but I know are possible: Playing Steam VR Games through Quest 2 on a Gaming PC and side loading applications. I'm excited to try both of these out.So all in all I really love the Quest 2, but are there anything's I dislike about it? Yes: Facebook. If you don't like or trust Facebook then the Quest isn't for you as it insists on you having a Facebook account. I don't necessarily like or trust Facebook, but I had an old account from years ago that I dusted off and the way I see it is, Zuckerberg knows everything about me anyway, he may as well know how awesome I am at Beat Saber.Tip: Don't do want I did and immediately lump for the 256Gb version thinking it's for the Hardcore VR Gamer. The game files aren't that big so you may wish to save £100 and settle for the 64Gb as I've downloaded around 20 games + DLC and still haven't come close to 3Gb yet.Tip 2: Buy yourself a new Quest Interface (the sponge bit that sits on your face) as it is horrible to wear when sweaty. And you will get sweaty.Get one, you won't regret it

in the process of sending this back. The headset was straight out the box, had not been dropped or bumped in anyway. I tried all the suggestions Oculus made, including a factory reset.  The buzzing noise is so intense it can be heard by others outside the headset.  Completely interferes with any enjoyment in using the headset.  A friend commented that it sounded like the kind of processing noise you get from a desktop - but this one is loud and in your ear.  - all the time. very disappointed

Technically the Quest 2 is a nice headset, but having to use a FACEBOOK account has more problems than a can of worms. It worked fine for a week, but when a crash happened, it lost the 6 paid for apps on it and I could not restore them from my account. Even after 10 weeks  of exchanging emails with Oculus support - they could not resolve it either, so I'm not bothering anymore and pursuing cost recovery for the system not being fit for purpose (i.e. you pay for a product that you can use if they need to be reloaded).I wish I had read the 1 star reviews before forking out £400 + £50 for the apps but It seems it is an all to common problem with Oculus.So take my advice and buy another product.Facebook has killed VR.

This is the most standalone solution to VR at a good price, It's around £100-200 cheaper than the previous Oculus Quest.  You can link it to your PC with the right USB-C cable for PC VR (you'll need a powerful PC as the PC VR is done via the computer).Slightly annoying that I had to re-buy a couple of Oculus Apps for Quest that I'd already purchased on Rift/Go. and the Facebook account could be a privacy worry for some folks.  Not really anything like this on the market right now that can touch it at this price.The good:* Powerful 1600p per eye resolution, and future upgrade to 90Hz will happen sometime in the future (currently locked to72hz)* Option to link to PC via cable (and there is a Wireless link option if you use ""Sidequest"" method from Quest 1).* Simple to use and setup and get going with some free experiences in the Oculus Store.* Limited Hand Tracking works out of the box (just need to enable the option) to allow you to use your hands for some Experiences instead of the controller.* 2 Hour battery life and you can extend it with a USB-C cable and a battery bank (no need for Elite Strap unless you want it for comfort).* 256GB model costs the same as the entry level Quest 1 Model with 32GB with more powerful processor.* Easy setup via Mobile Phone App (needed for intial setup, then everything can be done inside headset)The Bad* Need to re-buy some apps you may already own.* Oculus Store prices are a bit high for what the app does, use Oculus Link to play games and experiences from Steam, or from the web.* Facebook App requirement could be privacy concern or Deal-breaker for some. (though you can link an existing Oculus account to a Facebook account)* Official Oculus Link cable is expensive, finding a cheaper alternative could require some research.* IPD (Eye Spacing) adjustment is limited to 3 positions to save on costs  - most people will be fine, but there will be a few that will not find a good, clear setting that is perfectly clear for them.* Head Strap is white cloth and may look a little dirty after a few months of heavy use. (maybe upgrade to an elite strap or 3rd party solution later on when more accessories become available for Quest 2)

The oculus itself is very good. What I don’t like is the fact that you buy a very expensive piece of equipment and then have to spend so much more to actually use it.It’s absolutely disgusting. You pay to set it up. Pay for a cable to connect it. Pay for the software. The thing is completely unusable until you’ve paid for all the extras. It turned out to be the most expensive gift I bought my son. Not impressed at all!On top of that it’s a total headache setting it all up. Took over a week to finally have all the components working.If my son hadn’t wanted this so badly, I would have returned it. I’m very disappointed with the hidden costs and the complexity of use.I would not recommend this product at all.

I'm not going to review this in terms of product as if you're looking to buy one of these you're probably already well aware of anything I could say here. However, there are a few things I will say...1) You may want to buy a longer charging cable so you don't need to stop playing to charge to headset (factor that in to the cost, they're not cheap, over £30 at the time of writing).2) If you are going to be downloading a lot of content (games, packs, etc) and you can afford the more expensive higher capacity memory one, buy it. If not the cheaper one is perfectly fine.3) Don't be put off by the Facebook negative reviews (I nearly was). I have linked this to my account (which I've had for quite a few years) and it works just fine. Perhaps if you don't have a Facebook account or it's been dormant for a while that might be something to consider.4) This gets any 'armchair' gamer up and moving, rather like the Wii or Switch (and others) but it's waaaay cooler for young gamers to not be embarrassed about - trying to convince a teenage gamer to play this instead of Overwatch is not an issue, unlike Wii Tennis!I hope that's useful, rather than the usual reviews which I find often tell me what I already know (even if it's just from the other reviews).

I bought this as a joint Xmas present for myself and my son to use. I had already seen warnings online of people having issues with Facebook accounts etc so decided to order and setup early ready for Xmas. I don't have a Facebook account so a few days before the order I created a Facebook account and linked in to a an Oculus account all ready for delivery. Note that I used my correct name, date of birth, mobile number, address etc as I could see online some people having issues with Facebook accounts (and it seemed most of these were because of fake details being used).I turned on the Quest 2 and installed the Oculus app on my android mobile to attempt to activate the device.  Straight away after attempting to logging on to the app with my new Facebook account when I entered details was banned. No reason given, just banned.I contacted Oculus support and while they tried their best to be helpful in contacting Facebook support on my behalf ultimately I was still left with a device that couldn't be used.  As the device was unusable without a Facebook account I sent the device back for a refund. 7 days later my Facebook account sprung back to life, no contact from Oculus or Facebook I just know as I tried it each day.**What's important I think is that anyone buying this for the Xmas period gift or otherwise knows the potential issues. I think it will just be very sad if people end up with disappointed family members with a device that can't be used for 7 days due to account\software issue**Note Oculus have announced that in 2022 Facebook accounts won't be required to setup\use the device. I might give the Quest 2 another go once this is in place.

The headset is brilliant and offers an immersive experience with a good budget. It can be used as a standalone device, so you don't need a PC to play games and you can play in your room of choice at any time. The graphics display is brilliant and the games available are good fun.However, hope that you never need to contact oculus for support. Their customer service is absolutely appalling. The left speaker stopped working a week after the device was purchased (end of November) so contacted Oculus support to get it fixed. 35 (!!!) emails and more than a month later, they managed to lose the headset I had sent back, then find it and tell me that actually they made a mistake and wanted the controllers back too. Asked them to send it back to me without fixing it so I could return to Amazon and 10 days later they are still trying to find a way to send it to me. I then contacted Amazon, who very promptly contacted Oculus and surprise surprise - three days later the device was returned to me (mid January)!  Amazon have arranged for a replacement device which will hopefully work properly.All in all, great VR experience, horrible customer service by Oculus.Kudos to Amazon though, they provide the best customer service I have ever experienced.

I am really annoyed at this product, At no point in the product description dose it say this product is not suitable for under 13's, Like it says on the oculus safety setting web page.To top this off at no point dose it say anywhere YOU NEED A FACEBOOK ACCOUNT to use this product. It also dose not warn you that if you break facebooks code of conduct you can potentially lose access to your oculus device with a facebook ban.So here I am a parent setting up for Christmas my 11 year old has asked for one, I read thro everything above buy the item and 1 week later I have time to set it up, Only to find out all the above flaws of the Oculus Quest 2 and this page.

Been using an OG Vive for years, and the Quest 2 has proven to be a definite upgrade. I was a little worried it wouldn't be a big difference, or at least not enough of a difference, especially as I planned for PC VR gaming only. But the setup was easier (IMO) than the SteamVR setup in regards to the guardian and playspace. I've had far less tracking issues and of course no wires (for an hour or 2 at least, then it's play and charge for under an hour). Controller batteries are still over 50% after a solid week of use (my Vive controller batteries are dying a slow death and are what prompted this purchase) and are replaceable.Text is far easier to read than the OG vive and the inbuilt speakers are not terrible. I have had issues with SteamVR mirroring the Quest 2 via Steam Link on a pi 4, but have since switched to casting instead which works 90% of the time.What was more of a surprise is that the Quest 2 games (non PC VR games) are actually pretty good. The image quality is not Half Life Alyx good or Lone Echo but most VR games are not big on the visuals anyway.All in all I'm happy with the purchase and it's nice to replay some games I already had without the need for Revive.

For my 50th birthday my husband treated me to the Oculus Quest 2. I have never played any computer games and have zero coordination and I’m having a BLAST. It’s ridiculously easy to set up...simply load the oculus app onto which ever device you using ( I have an iPad ) and open your Facebook profile and link them. The games are downloaded to this app...I chose MOSS as my first to try. Then I’d suggest watching a few of the tutorials on their to help you get used to how the hand sets work. Tbh it’s dead easy! You can use this an a very small space if needed ! We are renovating a house so I have a 8 ft square area I can use and it’s not a problem ! Just set the area in the headset using your hand controls to mark it out and start playing. I use it for about 2 - 3 hrs without needing to charge the headset, if you want to play longer pop a power pack in your pocket and play as long as you like. The headset is a little front heavy and it was giving me a bit of a headache so I purchased a different one and it’s much more comfy as it distributes the weight more evenly. The handset batteries have been used every day for 3 weeks and are still at 90 / 85% - simply open settings and  you can check battery life in a glance. There are LOADS OF FREE a downloads and stuff to enjoy if you can’t afford too many apps/games. Also in notifications you should get a 25% discount off a game when you first register so look for that in the main oculus app. Each day they offer discounts on games so again check the app each day as some deals are very good. Over all as a new ‘gamer’ lol I am absolutely LOVING THIS. It’s incredible. The VR quality is mental good. Worth every single penny and is in fact a bargain when you consider how much I have used it already and that’s just a few hrs each night, when I have more space in our lounge I am def going to download the dance games and fitness ones son9 can get rid of my lockdown chub. 1000/10 absolutely AMAZING XXXX THANKS!

I’m giving it a two this time as the last one got a one. Tiny improvement on how hot the unit gets on your face, but still leaves your face “burnt” if using it for more than 15mins, so basically you still can’t watch a full film with it. I’m amazed it passes safety regulations. If you fell asleep with it on then you’d end up in hospital with serious burns. You still end up looking like a raccoon when you take it off + also extremely annoying that you must have a face”muck” account to use it. Just so they can take even more personal information from you.

I have never been a gamer. I have ADHD and hence I find it hard to concentrate on anything for long periods. Games on flat screens could never hold my attention for very long. I have always been an admirer of VR but never wanted to fork out the money for a VR pc and a Vive or something. As soon as I heard about the Quest 2 I wanted one. I pre-ordered it on announcement day and received it on Oct 13th. It is awesome. I would even say LIFE CHANGING!I had not exercised in 2 years and now I workout 3 times a week before work, in VR. One of my best mates got one and now we hang out all the time even though he lives 500 miles away. Being able to do sociable activities during the Covid pandemic has been amazing. This is the future of entertainment AND long distance interaction.I can't wait to see where this technology will go next.

I spent far too many hours trawling forums for ways to fix this headset’s connectivity issues, frequent crashes when connecting to the PC (Despite using the £80 cable recommended and sold by oculus) and general dysfunctions.The build quality is shabby at best and the plastic feels cheap and flimsy. The size adjustments for the eye pieces as well as the strap are frustratingly limited and the controllers are unergonomic.The oculus software on PC (which is mandatory if you want to play SteamVR games) is terrible, just google ‘Oculus PC Gray Screen’ to see what I and a lot of other users experienced.My PC specs are:NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070Intel I9 10980HK CPU @ 2.40GHz32 GB DDR4 RAMWindows 10 OSMy build far exceeds the recommended hardware for running VR but any effort to enjoy better quality games outside of the oculus store by tethering to my PC was an unmitigated disaster. Every problem I solved led to the next in what was a thoroughly frustrating consumer experience.In retrospect, this is an mid level VR system capable of running mobile phone grade mini-games and slightly better games albeit at lower quality than would be possible with functional tethering and limited to the meagre selection on the oculus store.Even when playing games downloaded directly to the headset I was plagued by crashes which returned me to the home screen, controller disconnections and blurry unsightly graphics (which were likely due to the poor strap tightening mechanism causing slippage during play).I am disappointed with this product and have returned it to Amazon. If you don’t have a capable PC, or your budget is limited I would recommend this headset. Otherwise there are far superior products on the market with proper support and compatibility which deserve to attract a higher price.

OMG this thing is amazing. The reality is unimaginable.  The realism initially caused me motion sickness. More like laid in the bottom of a boat feeling dreadful rather than an uncomfortable queezy car sickness feeling. Although I'm not fully immune yet, but the more I use it, the sickness is better.  I read into it and messed with a lot of settings on the headset game and the PC.  Also drink lots of water it helps. Tried the gimmicky aftermarket wrist bands. Didnt do anything for me.  I purchased this initially for sim racing after using  my large oled TV which has amazing graphics and that made me a bit queezy on certain sim games too.  The VR headset is a level above a single large screen.  The headset graphics aren't brilliant.  I installed Side Quest on my desktop. That allows  remote setup not available through the on board software.  The graphics are quite blurry at times.  at best I would rate it at 720p on occasion.  I have refused point blank in the past to use Facebook.  This device is FB sponsored. You can only use it with a FB account.  I'm using my new account on FB with all the settings to private.  I got the.256gb version. I thought it was worth the extra £100.  I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to download an FOC 111gb game. its rated 18 as its a bit blood and guts it going to be deleted when I need the space. There is another available FOC too that is 89 gb.  There is extra virtual desktop software available. Its good if you need to connect to the pc desktop and use a controller as a mouse. It is £14.99 extra. Although I was given an introductory  discount code. Cost me just over £10.  The official oculus accessories are expensive for what they are. The  C to C  fibre optic cable is an expensive disappointment. Its either poor quality or faulty. Keeps disconnecting from the desktop, which is quite annoying. I purchased a 3 mtr CtoC high speed after market cable at a third of the price and it works really well.  The original faulty/poor quality cable is being returned.  The original elastic headband is poor. Comes loose often even when tight it doesn't offer much support or stability for the headset.  After the experience with the £90 cable I steered away from the oculus elite headband at almost £50 . A replacement headband strap is a must. I got an aftermarket/ copy of the elite and its miles better than the supplied elastic one. One very important thing to mention is 'IPD' (inter pupillary distance). This has 3 manual settings for narrow medium and wide. My measurement is 73mm which is quite wide and just on the edge of the larger setting of the unit. its worth getting a phone app  to measure it.  Overall. Would i recommend it. Yes its amazing. Be prepared for extra expense though.  Its a lot if fun to use.

As a competetive Beat Saber player, I chose to upgrade to the Quest 2 due to it's faster refresh rate over the RIft S. I ordered the Quest 2 without a link cable or optional extras, as I wanted to give Oculus Air Link a go first. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite live up to the hype. I have 10gig LAN and unfortunately still could not quite get to a smooth experience in any game.If you want to spend another £25 on Virtual Desktop - that's a much better experience for Remote PCVR, when playing games like Superhot, I could not distinguish any difference from being connected directly to the PC.Eventually I broke, as Beat Saber is my main game and I could not play it wirelessly at all (no problem, I wasn't intending to in the first place). I ordered a third-party USB-C to USB-C USB3.0 cable, and the experience has been great after some tweaking with settings such as bitrate and compression. I don't know whether the Oculus Link cable is any better, but I have no issues with a third-party cable.All in all though, the headset is great. 120hz is crazy smooth, and the resolution is insane. The screen-door effect is barely visible (being able to see the space inbetween the pixels - this was an issue on the Rift/Rift S), and the controllers track great.Things I'm not particularly fond of:-- You need to enable Developer Mode to disable guardian, which involves a lot of effort.-- A lot of developers do not have support for cross-platform purchases. If you have already purchased the game on PC and want to play on the Quest 2 standalone, you will have to purchase the game again.-- The strap isn't great in comparison to the elite strap on the Rift S, this can be fixed though as the elite strap for the Quest 2 is sold as an optional extra-- By default, the brightness is a little too high and can cause eye-strain, YMMV.-- White controllers start looking not so nice real fast if you're working up a sweat.Little things I am fond of:-- The new controller design is super comfortable, and there is more space to rest your thumb.-- Volume control is super well placed-- A SIlicone faceplate cover is included, which I use whenever I am using the Quest 2.-- Hand tracking is built in, although it is rudimentary and cannot be used via Oculus Link.I am confident that Wireless PCVR will improve over-time, especially considering it is an experimental feature. Apart from that though, I'd say I'm impressed with what Meta/Oculus have created.

This purchase was a shambles from start to finish. Intended as a Christmas gift. Took a while to ship. Rest of delivery was fast tho.Not going to spend much time on the whole Facebook issue. You've either got a Facebook account, or you've got a £300 paperweight.  It's their product, Meta makes Oculus... so there is no point crying about having to use their service to run their product. If you don't want that issue then buy playstation vr instead.My issues (FB aside)... first is that it is still a quite new system and is still being upgraded/built as of now (Jan 2022). So some things will work one day and then be broken for a week.Second is that this was bought on finance, and I was sent a faulty unit with a drifting controller. No replacement available, and then a month to reset the finance options before I can reorder my kids Christmas gift. So not only could they potentially be faulty units, but they are a highly unreliable purchase unless you have £300 to outright buy. And even then it might be a dodgy unit.Pros.. headset is actually great when it works. Clear viewing and adjustable lense spacing. Basic headstrap isnt ideal, but is upgradable. Games are cheaper than big console games.

My friends say I buy too many gadgets. I do. However, this is one of my best. I bought it after seeing Beatsaber and my word, it does so much more.Some great games, Beatsaber, Topgolf, Darth Vader, Fishing, Superhot, Saint and Sinners and I've not even tried Half Life yet.Google Earth, go anywhere in the mapped world!3d Movies, absolutely superb, I hate 3d in Cinemas...this is excellent.Streaming my PC to the Oculus wirelessly, perfect.And more to come I am sureThe sound without headphones is really impressive around the ears, what they do with directional sound in amazing. Not very bassy but if you want to play and hear your friends or the front door bell, it's perfect.I almost regretted buying the 256GB version but now I rip 3d movies to it, it soon fills up.The fact they used Android to base this thing on was the best thing Facebook could have done. There are so many mods to do, it becomes really multiuse.The fact I can throw it in a case and take round my friends to play, awesome and the main reason I bought one.Fantastic.

I don't use Facebook - I had an account some years ago - but can't seem to re-enable it probably because I call myself Jim, and my on my passport my name is James - so I'm blocked from access to that account and blocked from creating another with email aliases. (Yes, that's right, they want your passport/identity papers)Even if I created another account to get this hardware working, if Facebook find out I have a second, I'd get banned from both and then presumably lose access to this hardware again.I don't know who Facebook think they are. I have a uk government ID that was easier to set up than trying to get Facebook to work - and they offer no help - once you have been denied access - that's it.So I'll spend a bit more money and get the Valve Index instead - at least I don't need to buy new headstraps for that, or pay an extra £80 for a fancy USB cable to make it work - and the FOV and variety of games is better so.Oculus have shot themselves in the foot with this nonsense.

There's been a lot of attempts at VR over the last 30 years, and I've had a play with all of them, but none were particularly compelling.  The barn door effects, the sense of disorientation.  Nothing quite grabbed the promise and delivered.The Quest 2 is the device that finally has what it takes to gain broad appeal.  Firstly, the price is just insane.  Then is the ability to not only act as a competent tethered device (not significantly inferior to the vastly more expensive Valve Index or HP devices), but to offer truly untethered, wireless, wonder.  The inside out tracking makes setup a breeze (no installing multiple 'base station' detectors anywhere, just stick it on your head and get going.As a first-time user, you are immediately acquainted with the guardian feature, where you set your room boundaries.  This may be a safety feature but it immediately sets the tone of what is to come.  It demonstrates the comforting ""pass-through"" feature that gives you an otherworldly black and white view of your surroundings that is surprisingly effective and well-aligned.  Moreover, it confirms the accuracy of the tracking going on, inspiring confidence.After setting up your guardian boundaries you are taken to a relaxing 3D home (customisable) and walked through a comprehensive and enjoyable setup.  I highly recommend going through the First Time users app and dancing with the robot!The home immediately transforms you with the immersive 3D soundscape that is magical for a device that doesn't even place speakers over your ears.  Clever engineering reflects the sound into them with such precision that you can hardly tell you are wearing a headset.  Despite that, it is more than sufficient to drown out background noise without leaving you feeling disconnected.There are still ways to go with the optics, untethered graphics and resolution, and there are better headsets out there, but your casual user will not notice such things.  None of them allow you to just stick the device on your head and get going, and that freedom makes this the benchmark for all future devices.  If better textures matter you can always get the Oculus link and tether it to a hi-end gaming PC.  What really matters though, is the promise that this device holds.With that promise, I have no doubt that the 2020s will be the decade of VR.

I bought this on amazon, because I found it hard to read up on why it was cheaper then a lot of other setups, and what that meant I'd be compromising on. It seems to do everything I wanted!- It can be used standalone, no PC needed- have a look at the oculus store for games before you buy if using standalone- it has a fantastic ""guardian"", this means if you are playing in a small space and you set a perimeter, when you go too near the edge you can set it to warn you or even better (my fav setting) you then see the room you are in to stop yourself walking into something.- the guardian seems to remember which rooms I have setup before, so when I'm in a room I played in a few days ago, the guardian is done- you can set guardian to stationary mode (yes you become those weird walking players in Phasmaphobia)- speaking of Phas, that game is the one game that causes me a bit of giddyness - this is not the headset, but the way the game moves you by joysticks- You Cannot play Phas without a PC- playing VR on a PC, I have played steam VR to play Phas and pavlov and other games. Steam also has an Oculus VR mode (it asks you)- you can play wired or wireless to your PC. This is fantastic as I plan to try playing my PC games wirelessly while in the garden! (I have good IT setup for WiFi coverage)- wireless is in beta mode. A pro gamer would prefer the oculus link, but I haven't noticed any difference yet. You need to turn it on in beta settings by downloading oculus setup to your PC and finding beta tab.- you can use your hands as controllers (without the handsets) you pinch to select. Not all games support this but its great for saving the battery of the handsets and can be a feature you enable and jump between hands and handsets without having to tell it.- remote into your PC. I tried virtual desktop and the oculus link. Both cool for different reasons. If you have lag on one I would try the other. I bought virtual desktop before I realised oculus link was free.- when you remotely connect to your PC you get a warning about the frequency of your home Internet hub. By standard these are normally broadcasting 2.5ghz but if you can work out how to remote into your hub and turn on the 5ghz then the headset would work faster on that. I setup a separate channel called myinternetname-5Ghz. Not all devices support this channel (yet). You will want you PC wired to your hub.- my favourite games so far! Beat saber, play alone, play online but whatever you do makes sure you light saber the blocks away in beat to the music! Pistol Whip (and select the double gun setup - one in each hand). This game is amazing - you feel like John Wick and you have a great workout (when my husband tried this he made the headset padding very wet from sweat!)Sorry I have written so much, I just feel this information was hard to find. I thought I'd have to return it when it couldn't do what I wanted but now we are considering one each so we can play multilayer games online.Enjoy yours!(oh and all the negative comments are about FB, you need a FB account because that's who owns Oculus. Don't get your account locked out and you will be fine)

Didn't really want one, but hey, off to Facebook i go and make an account. Never had one before, but within  minutes of opening the account the account is closed for violating their services. Hand on heart, i only entered my phone number and DOB to open the account. Didnt post anything, link with anyone, nothing. Facebook are going to look into this but its going to take around 7 days. Oculus support cant do anything except send me a standard email saying ""facebook will get back to you"" Dont open another account! No way to get in touch with facebook if your account is closed so just sat here wondering if ever they will get back to me.Totally disgusted with the support. Buy something else. Anything else.

My first try out of VR, and it's pretty breathtaking, immersive experience!Drawbacks are, that it's not suitable for wearers of spectacles, and I found it uncomfortable to wear for more than a few minutes. Battery life is only about a bit over 1.5 hours.Controllers not very intuitive, and I found myself getting lost or stuck in the menu structure.Cost of software looks high, and the free stuff is not brilliant.I did watch an episode of The Grand Tour through Amazon Prime on it, and found it good - very immersive.Also good for watching films on Netflix, although do you really want something stuck on your face for 2 hours?Overall, it's probably not for me, I might sell it on eBay.

Having used the original Oculus was hoping the hype for the Oculus 2 was justified. While many of the reviews have been good and accurate I haven't come across any which describes just how washed out the display is. Over saturated making most of the dark atmospheric games like the Vader titles look like you're viewing everything through a white vail. While the resolution is better, the picture quality is far worse than the original Quest, which despite having a lower resolution was able to convince you that you were indeed in a different world. I'll now be waiting for 4k OLED display because LCD doesn't cut it.

Bought this as part of the Black Friday promotion. Graphics obviously way better than the samsung VR headset I had before. However the weight distribution is ridiculous.Since all the weight is concentrated the front, it feels far too heavy and pulls against the back of your head. I can't imagine wearing this for more than 5 minutes, let alone hours on end.I was waiting until I received the headset before deciding whether to buy the elite strap as it could be an unneccesary expense. However don't hesitate, I'm sure if I continue using the headset as it is I will definitely have headaches.I think the elite strap should have been included as part of the actual headset, as the design is obviously flawed. If enough people had complained originally I'm sure facebook would have bundled the strap with it.

Ok, this is an amazing vet headset for the price, it is amazing, please don’t waste your money on others like the valve index or other oculus headsets, this is amazing for the money, and if your thinking of buying a PSVR, DO NOT, it’s a lot older, a lot worse and you need to be facing a camera you can’t see, the oculus quest 2 is portable, better looking, WIRELESS, and it can count as its own console as it has storage with shops to buy games on, so you don’t even need a PS4 or a PC with this, although you can plug it in and play PC games as well

Well Headset is rather good, I am not a fan with there only being 3 settings for the setting of the eye width, sadly a 4th wider or a variable setting would of been nice.Default head strap is not that good, not comfortable, especially for long play sessions.While the tracking has been a lot better than my PS4 VR it has lost tracking a couple of times, but that is fine.I will say I am liking that actual VR Hardware, sadly I am not a fan of the Oculus Software, especially the OVRService Service that is always running on the PC constantly fills up the Event Log on my PC, this service also causes strange glitches / issues when running (seems to scan my drives outside of the Oculus folder etc, WHY YOU DOING THAT FACEBOOK / META?) so I have to stop that service while not using the headset.For now I have written my own application to auto start the OVRService Service then the Oculus Client while I am using the headset and once done it auto stops the OVRService Service.Overall I am loving the headset, just that I am not a fan of all the snooping software needing to be installed to use it.One main issue I am annoyed with is that you need the Oculus App on your phone for the headset to work, especially the store. WHY?

Easy to use, easy to setup, reasonable quality. Excellent tracking. I sent mine back because though my laptop grfx card was listed as supported, because it was a laptop part, it lacked the VR extensions to link with the quest. I managed to use apps to make a working area that mirrored my computer displays, but without the additional computer power, I was reliant on apps specifics built for quest which while good, are still very clunky in the main. The fabric head strap was a disaster and I upgraded it for a third party halo type, but even then I was constantly adjusting the position to get things in focus. The best game was a crazy golf that though it had simple slab graphics, really felt like you were somewhere else. The controllers are amazing. The final straw was how hot the thing was to wear. By definition a vr headset seals you off from the world, but it also seals off most ventilation and made me sweat, I dread to think what it would be like in summer.This year the quest 3 should launch and along with a much faster chip enabling far better graphics (this is all conjecture on my part) I expect the more serious communication and office work apps to take centre stage. At present they are there for quest 2 but not yet matured. They feel like Tech demos which I suspect the next quest will improve on immeasurably.  There is a need to improve the optics to get the sweet spot easier to use. When the headset was on I found tilting it up slightly gave me the best picture but using it very quickly made the headset slip. I wonder if some sort of eye tracking would obviate this.So in summary, good but not great. Not quite fast enough (unless linked to a compatible computer) not quite high enough resolution but I suspect the next one will be the best point to drop in.

Bought this for my husband for Christmas. Worked well for 3 days then suddenly headset kept turning off every 2-10 seconds. Searched for troubleshooting, rebooted headset and finally restored to factory settings, no improvement. Got through to Oculus live support and 3 different people gave me the same advice to reboot and restore to factory settings, even though i explained we had already completed those steps several times. Instead of admitting it was broken and saying I would have to return they asked to change communication to email. Via email they still didn’t state the Quest 2 would have to be returned, but asked for shipping address, how I would prefer to return etc and saying once I had provided this information customer support would be in touch in 3-5 working days.As we all go back to work on the 4th and wanted to use the VR while we’re off work and stuck at home in tier 4, this was not the response I was looking for, so decided to return for full refund and order a new one via Prime instead. Not ideal as I have currently spent £800 on the Oculus Quest 2 and don’t yet have a working device. Hoping this was a one off faulty unit as I couldn’t find any posts about this issue on forums.My friend has had one for a few weeks and no issues, which we tried (between lockdowns) and loved, so decided to invest. Hoping new device arrives quicker than the 4 days advised on Amazon via Prime and will post a review of that device once received.

My boys love it I was sceptical buying the lower 126 version but to be honest it will hold more than enough games to keep them occupied .Honestly this is the best thing ever I love the fact that most of the games are reasonably priced lots of free ones to play to probably get 3 hours constant play out of one charge and charges fairly quickly to tbh 2 to 3 hours play is more than enough especially as some.games can make u a bit motion sick . The extra posh head strap included is awesome a little more expensive than the one u can buy from amazon but I love the added comfort bit at the back so much worth spending that bit extra .  The kids love rec room online games place free to play just gets a bit ragey . Best saber is awesome been a bit sneaky and had a go the br you tube app is pretty cool this is the old mum thing like underwater sea stuff I even sat by the beach I'm my own lounge was pretty cool . Adults will love this to had s go at a scary games  nope to scary lol .. still a great bit of kit  defintely gonna buy my own defintely immersive .Be careful when playing  kids getting in the way adults getting in the way been clocked a few times by the brood playing. mission impossible trying to dodge flailing  arms  when grabbing stuff from.their rooms  although more fun grabbing the little goblins by suprise though .

I got all excited about buying a Quest 2, I've never owned a VR headset before, and I enthusiastically launched myself into this one, buying several games on the first day and spending hours using it.  Nearly a month later and I've used it once in the last week.  Why?  Two main reasons:1:  The damn thing keeps sliding down my face.  I've watched YouTube videos on how to put it on 'properly',  but it seems that the supplied head strap is a poor man's version of the 'Elite Strap' that retails for an extra £49, and has been out of stock for weeks.  The design of the Oculus is front-heavy, so naturally it'll take something special to stop it sliding down your face (sending everything slowly out of focus) while in use.  Charging an extra £50 to put this right is - I think - cheeky.  I'm reluctant to throw good money after bad to correct this problem.2: The games I want to play all have the same drawback - lack of space.  My 'playing area' in my living room is 2.2 metres square, which isn't big enough to comfortably play games like Beat Saber, Vader, Elven Assassin and Super Hot VR, because they all require you to move (or flail your arms whilst ducking and avoiding things), so within seconds I'm at the extremity of my playing area and faced with the vertical boundary lines superimposed over whatever I'm playing, which ruins the experience.  I think 3 square metres would be a sensible minimum requirement, any less and you're in for a second-rate gaming experience.Apart from that there are many upsides to the Oculus, much to like and be impressed with, but the physical experience of using it leaves me annoyed and frustrated.  Maybe if someone gifts me an Elite Strap I'll change my mind, but for now the Quest 2 is staying in its box and I'm regretting spending nearly £500 on something I'm not really using.

I have played video games since I was 7 or 8 (now mid-forties) but I must admit I am genuinely impressed by the fully immersive experience provided by the Quest 2. This is truly the future of gaming but also many other usage. Considering I only paid £249 (with an extra £50 Amazon discount code), amazing value for money.I had tried VR before through the Samsung Gear VR headset, which works with my Samsung S10 phone. Works well and excellent value for money. However, there was a lot of screen door effect (visible pixels) and the lens would always get foggy quickly. Also, the Gear VR does only what's called ""rotational tracking"" (3DoF), basically tracking head movements.With the Quest 2, the screen door issue is gone and the lens never seem to get foggy, probably because the device itself is warm while being used (due to CPU etc.).Of course, the headset is much better too as it can track the user moving within a space or room (called ""Positional Tracking"", 6DoF). It's no longer just about moving your head, it's also about moving your body within a set space. Basically, the headset has a number of built-in cameras that can track the room and determine the position of the player within that room. No external sensors are being used. Truly impressive technology. It's possible to ""draw"" on the floor some limits, which will show as ""virtual walls"" within games, so that the player doesn't bump into something or kicks some items or walls. It's also possible to just have a smaller standing limit (basically just a circle).The tracking of the controllers is impressive too, extremely precise, in all directions. It's now also possible to just track hands instead of using controllers, but not all apps or games support this yet.Some excellent immersive games available, and I do like the fact it's possible to cancel the purchase and get a refund if a game has been used less than 2 hours (and was bought less than 14 days ago). Basically, a way to try games, without risks.Lots of free games, 3D animation and 360 videos too, of varying quality.It's also a great idea to have included a silicon cover so that the headset foam is protected, as a lot of sweating can happen on some games. The silicon cover can be easily removed and cleaned.The only drawbacks so far are:* battery life of the headset is quite short (around 3 hours) but can always carry a battery pack and USB cable while playing* videos are less convincing than 3d animations, even in very high resolutions* Many of the games are quite expensive, considering the usually shorter game time compared to more traditional games* it would have been good to be able to extend storage via a micro SD card* needs quite a lot of empty space, probably at least 2m x 2m else it's quite constraining on many games* casting to my Samsung TV hasn't worked so far (but there are other options available, like Casting to a Chrome browser or the Oculus app itself)

I thought VR was a gimmick, and for the most part it still is. But it is a very fun and very affordable gimmick with the current Quest 2.Even if you don't plan to play games, and almost end up throwing up after spending 30 minutes manically swinging a virtual sword in my living room, the Quest 2 is still worth it.You can watch Netflix in a home cinema environment, watching it on a huge screen was awesome! Purchasing Virtual Desktop from the Oculus Store allowed me to stream directly from my PC so I could watch Funimation for my anime fix (not Crunchyroll because they like DRM ********!). It also gives you access to the Steam VR library of games too as the Quest 2 doesn't have a huge catalogue of games.Obviously you won't get 4K resolution but it is still quite passable, playing from the Quest itself (since it is a standalone unit that runs and stores it's own games) does come with a performance and fidelity loss. A lot of the games cater to that though, so at least they run reasonably well.I am pretty keen to try out some fitness apps, even being able to lift my weights in a virtual environment sounds fun. Although lifting weights while blind might not be a great idea, then again, I've managed to drop them on my face even with being able to see.And well, I'm glad I bought this, I couldn't find an Xbox Series X or PS5, and after the troubles I have had recently with broken games on the XBOX and Microsoft illegally refusing refunds, and not being able to contact anyone directly regarding it. They can take a long walk off a short cliff.

It may be my age, it may be my eyes, but I just couldn't get on with this at all.Firstly, I didn't want it for gaming, I wanted it for watching films. I expected to be able to immerse myself in a good sci-fi like Dune and be amazed watching it on a giant screen. The reality was much less immersive. It was just a slightly blurred small screen that still had all this wasted real estate around it. If I had wanted to be able to see rows of chairs in front of me and to the sides, I'd have gone to the cinema to watch it. I just wanted a clear large screen and nothing else. Even when you turn off all the distractions, the screen doesn't fill your vision, it still only fills the centre and is no bigger than sitting in our living room watching our 50"" TV quite close up.Quality-wise, it is much worse. It doesn't have anything like the picture quality of a TV screen or a computer monitor and after about 10 mins of wearing them, I felt quite sick.I did try gaming and for casual gaming I could sort of get the point, but even then I felt sick and the graphics weren't as good as my gaming laptop's built-in screen or the external monitor.So they weren't for me. At least I tried.

I will make this review as short as possiblePros:1. Really fun to play and mess around with2. Feels Immersive3. One of the cheapest Vr headsets on the martket4. Super comftable to wear for long hours without if hurting5.  You dont even need a PC to play the games due to the Oculus Marketplace where they have Popular games like VR-Chat, Walking dead Saints and Sinners, Paranormal VR, Arizona Sunshine, Resident Evil VR and even blade and sorcery and many more popular gamesCons:1. Battery life absoloutely awful youll be lucky to  get 2 hours of use before you have to spend 5 hours charging the device2. To use it with Steam youll have to invest in a £85 cable or risk buying a third party one which is not as good although thee headset is useable with steam without it you need a SERIOUSLY good connection speed or LAG will heavily ruin your immersion3. YOU NEED A FACEBOOK ACCOUNT or it is unuseable if you get banned from facebook you'll no longer be able to use the device might aswell bin it despite claims you would never need a FB account when the device was announced Also be prepared to see masses of Oculous ads on your fb page after making an account had roughly 500 oculus ads on my feed daily since using the oculus which personally is an invasion of privicy but hey its facebook afterall4. Games are not cheap at all ended up spending roughly £85 on games on top of already spending £300 on the device all games come with Tax which makes them even more expensive some of these games being years old Sure it has a multitude of Free games but £85 on just 3 oldish VR games is unacceptable and no Alternative cheaper stores unless you use steam salesOverall: Apart from suffering with low battery life and various problems and you want to get in on the VR craze for as cheap as possible  like me its 100% worth the moneyHopefully this helps out anybody who maybe intrested

I had to buy one of these for a module of my game development course and the time spent playing about with it before said class started was some of the most fun I've had with motion control since the Wii! Beat Saber instantly became one of my top rhythm games and SuperHot VR was a fun spin on a game I already thoroughly enjoyed.Setup for the headset on its own is rather easy though, yes, you do need a Facebook account. Not the biggest deal for most people but if you don't want to link/create your own, you may need to look for another headset.Using it with your PC gets a bit more pricey though. You'll already need a decent one to run newer VR games, but you'll also need to buy a cable of a decent length (and a USB-C to USB converter if you don't have any USB-C ports on your computer). I opted for the official cable even though it was more expensive than other third-party offerings since I didn't want to take any risks.I can't make any informed comparisons with regards to other headsets since this if my first, though I'd highly recommend this one if you're just dipping your toes into VR for the first time.

As you can tell from the headline I'm very pleased with this purchase.  I had a PS4 with PSVR previously and I can tell you that I've now sold the PSVR as it will never be touched again.  The fact that this doesn't need to be tethered to anything with a cumbersome cable, doesn't require additional equipment (PS4 console / gaming PC & ugly light houses mounted around the room) is really a game changer for me.  Add to that that you CAN tether it to a PC if you want to get better graphics quality then your options are wide open.The only slight downside to the headset are the straps for me.  I can't get them to keep the headset in place during rapid movement without making them overly tight.  I was going to buy the Elite Strap to see if this improves things, but so far it has been sold out.  I'll update here once I get it to let you know if it improved things.Regarding the Facebook account requirement you'll have to decide if it's worth it to you or not, but yes, it did indeed require a Facebook account to activate.

Until this headset, Oculus has not disappointed, first owning a Rift then a Rift S. The Quest 2 is pitched as a Rift S replacement offering the best of both worlds with the option to be wired to a PC or not. Unfortunately it falls massively short of this. Whilst the price is the same for the base unit as the Rift S was, you might think this is a very good deal as you are effectively getting a built in mobile phone with 256 GB of memory to drive it when not tethered to a PC. Unfortunately they have been forced to make savings else where to achieve this and this is what's flawed this headset.The headset is not useable with the straps you get with it. Therefore paying the extra £50 for the elite strap is a must, but even with this its not as comfortable to use compared to a Rift S.The lenses are the biggest disappointment. Only what you are looking directly at is clear, your entire peripheral field of view is obscured by rings in the lens that not only obscure the picture but reflect light across the lens breaking immersion. The RIft S has none of these issues so the only reason for the change I can understand is to save money.The Quest 2 comes with three physical settings for IPD (interpupillary distance). This should be an improvement over the Rift S as it only has software setup. However in my case, I have found that none of them are comfortable and a real strain on my eyes to use compared to the Rift / Rift S. This is what makes the Quest 2 unusable for me but as this experience is going to be different for everyone, maybe you will have better luck.The final issue is obviously the forced Facebook sign in and ultimately the Facebook spying that certainly comes with that. Facebook is a company that trades on your data so this is just another channel for them to harvest that data.I will continue to use my Rift S until Facebook discontinue it and then I think its time to seriously look at the competitors. As a result I cannot recommend Oculus to anyone.

This is not a group activity... It is almost impossible to share video or cast to your TV. Everything is locked down by Facebook so they want to inspect everything you share. You cannot use it without a Facebook account even though you're not supposed to have one until your 18, does this mean kids aren't allowed to play it? Some of the games are very fun despite the bad graphics, the head and hand tracking are very good. As standard it is very uncomfortable to wear, it's front heavy and soon hurts your neck, the viewing portal is often blurry because it doesn't line up to your eyes the way you would like it to or condensation needs wiping off the lenses. It's great that you don't have to have a wire connecting you to the device, what isn't great is that the battery runs out in no time at all, meaning you either have to buy a really long cable and keep tripping over it or stop playing after an hour and a half so you can recharge it. It would be a lot better if it was more comfortable to wear, you could share what you were doing easier without having to do it through Facebook, the battery lasted longer or they had an additional battery to counterbalance the breeze block on the front of your face. It's a good device but it seems like Facebook are going to ruin it before it ever gets going properly.....All this time later and they still have not fixed the video sharing bug.

The hardware works pretty much perfectly, the ease of use is up there too and most stuff was intuitive.The issues are that in terms of games there really is only a handful of essentials and with rumours going around that valve are ditching VR in favour of steam link that wipes out a solid chunk of the potential great games.Here's the deal breaker though, I got my headset and then 5 days later a family member got one too but didn't have a Facebook account (mine was lying dormant since college) so I made their account with 100% real information only to find an hour later that FB suspended their account and wanted a picture of them to verify they were real...We took said picture and got a vague ""we will get back to you at some point"".As the FB account was suspended they couldn't use their headset at all, not even so much as pair it with the oculus app on their phone or pc.Did some looking online and found it can take anywhere from hours to months for them to verify accounts.So my family member returned theirs and I joined them by returning mine seeing as their suspension really soured me on the headset.FB or Meta as they are trying to rebrand are removing the FB requirement from oculus headsets some time next year. I wouldn't rule out getti g one again in the future if they do axe the FB requirement but I would still need to see multiple other games come through from big studios to show a commitment to VR.

Wondering whether to get it? Here’s a straight forward pros and cons list for you.Pros:- All in one wireless headset (no annoying cables, no need for PC linking or extras to buy)- Durable (can take a drop/knock like a champ - tougher than it looks)- Online multiplayer doesn’t require a silly subscription fee- Fair amount of decent free games on store to play- 128 GB model suits anyone who isn’t a hardcore gamer (besides you can uninstall games anyway)- Price (can seem hefty, but consider the above points and also other VR headset prices being significantly more)- Guardian system (allows you to draw a boundary to play in, useful for smaller spaces)Cons:- Battery life (might consider a battery pack if you want more than 2 hours of gameplay)- Long recharging time- Space required (2 m x 2 m ideal, can be less with drawn guardian system, more space better unless you want to sucker punch every piece of furniture you own)- FaceBook account required (dealbreaker for some, if you feel strongly just make a new basic FB account)- VR sickness (can be an issue, so build up tolerance - 15 mins when you start. Take breaks. When you get your VR legs, remember to take 15 min breaks for every hour)- Basic head strap (this was an issue for me, might not be for you, the base model has a elastic adjustable strap which didn’t keep the headset stable thus kept being blurry - fixed it by buying a simple £15 silicon accessory that attaches to the back of your head for support)- Software costs (lots of titles available, just bare in mind costs can be from £10 up to £40. Costs can add up quickly. However, if you don’t like a game for whatever reason, you can refund within 2 weeks and with less than 2 hours gameplay)All in all - decent buy, I spend more time playing this than my Switch, Xbox, PC.

This is the first time I have owned a VR headset and so I cannot compare this to other models. For the price I feel it is a great ‘entry level’ into the VR world. So far I am delighted with it! Yes, you have to link it to a Facebook account. For me, I just don’t care about this. You can choose your privacy options and I just selected I didn’t want to publish what I was doing on my Facebook account. In regards to ‘data mining’, again I just do not care. I have had my 256Gb Quest 2 for three weeks now and I have had many hours of fun playing it. My girlfriend has also enjoyed watching me (using a Google Chromecast casting to our TV), especially the excellent game Five Nights at Freddie’s which is terrifying to play. I do have issues with the casting, as there is a (roughly) 0.5s delay between actual audio/visual gameplay and what is transmitted to the TV, but I understand this will be an issue when wirelessly casting data like this.The games I have downloaded are great fun. These include Beat Saber, Pistol Whip, Robo Recall and Five Nights at Freddie’s. You really get lost in the VR environments and it reminds me of the kind of arcade games I grew up with in the 90s (except ramped up 1000x). I do wish there were more Horror games though, as I feel that these are particularly fun to play. After much deliberation I chose the 256Gb version over the 64Gb. My reasoning being I would rather have too much space than too little. The games tend to be between 800MB - 5/6GB, however I expect newer releases to be closer to the latter.I have found the battery life is probably around 2 hours with intense play, although I’ve never timed it. This hasn’t been an issue for me as after about 30mins to an hour I’m mentally and physically exhausted.I think the worst features of the headset are the foam facial interface and the strap that come as standard with the product. The facial interface isn’t particularly soft/spongy and after 20-30mins it starts to ache around the forehead. I think this is in part due to the material but also because of the cheap (cost-saving) strap. The strap works, but it doesn’t provide a comfortable fit and, as with other reviews, it does tend to put pressure on the tops of the ears after a short while. Today I received the Elite Strap with battery pack and the difference is incredible. I would definitely recommend purchasing this as an add-on. I will be reviewing this separately. I will also be buying a different facial interface, probably from VRcover.com, when one is available.Overall I think this is an excellent entry-level VR headset (although specs-wise, this isn’t entry level), based upon my limited VR experience. Hardcore VR users may disagree. For the extra £120 I think the Elite Strap with battery pack (and case) is worth the money. The strap, at least, is essential to improve comfort. In terms of the 64Gb vs 256Gb, this will depend on your preference and whether you think £100 extra for quadruple the storage is worthwhile. Obviously when you add up these ‘extras’ the headset suddenly isn’t quite as cheap as you would hope.

It works just as well as my Rift but without the sensors. My only complaint - and it's a big one - is how uncomfortable it is. So far I've spent longer fiddling with the strap than actually playing any games. The weight on your face, cheeks, and eye sockets is horrible.I bought the 'Elite Strap' hoping to fix the issue and nope. Still painful. I've come to the conclusion the Quest 2 it's just too front heavy. The only way to remedy this problem is with a counter weight. Yes, I'm talking about DIY attaching something - I used old batteries - to the back of the head strap.If you're willing to do this, it's a great product. If you're not, you should wait for the next one. Just prey it's not designed by a sadist.

I'm amazed it works as well as it does. Way better than I expected. No matter the VR you use/watch, it's very convincing.With some headsets I've used you can quite clearly see the pixels but, the Quest 2 is clear and crisp.There is absolutely no noticeable lag during use and prevents a lot of the motion sickness issues a lot of people have. The room scale tracking works incredibly well allowing you to walk around in VR in your REAL room without the need for external units.The headset can be uncomfortable when worn for a long time and the stock head-strap can be a pain to use.The controllers are responsive and smooth. They must have touch sensors in the buttons because the fake fingers you see in games can track where your fingers are on the controller.I'm yet to find a game my (short) kids can play properly. The height in many games doesn't really seem to be adjustable.5/5 from me. I love it. My 60+ year old mother loves it.

I don't usually bother wasting my time writing a review but the Oculus Quest 2 is amazing.I've been a gamer for 30+ years and I've never been convinced on VR.. I just thought it was another gimmick that would disappear along with 3D TV's, Kinect and the Power Glove.But I'm happy to say that I was wrong and I now use my Oculus Quest 2 for not only gaming but for multimedia. It's great sitting on my sofa and watching a movie on the cinema screen with the BigScreen app (indulging 3D movies).Battery life could be better but I just end up plugging it in to an external power bank and that works fine for me.Although the cheap head strap they provide does the job at the start, I'd personally recommend upgrading it to the BoboVR M2 or something similar asap just for more comfort and stability.

We bought this as a big treat. We don't usually buy such expensive gifts for the kids for Christmas but this was a one-off big joint gift, intended for the whole family to use.I had debated about getting an Oculus for a while since the Rift. What had put me off the Rift was the need for a PC (which we didn't have) so when the Quest 2 didn't require a laptop I was quite pleased. Luckily I am not averse to connecting to Facebook because it does require you to have a Facebook account in order to play. I think I saw something about plans to make it so you don't have to connect through Facebook but I'm not sure if or when that could be.The safety features are great. They keep you in a safe area to play in and tell you when you're coming out of it.There appears to be plenty of free games on the internet to play on and the games to buy range from approximately £5 to £25 which is considerably less than you would pay for games on other systems.We've had lots of fun with it so far.

Many people may not agree, but the Oculus in its present form is an overrated and overpriced gimmick. I suggest doing more research before buying it. I wish I had, but I assumed it was a simple plug and play device I could use with my flight sim software.If you do decide to ignore the moans of a 50 something bloke and you decide to invest be prepared for the following. For the price it is poor value for money. The unit does not come with leads to connect to devices independently and it doesn't come with a proper set of instructions to at least get you started. Despite some You Tube bloggers saying otherwise, the device can only be effectively operated exclusively through a Facebook account. This is something I personally find unacceptable, as I do not have or indeed want a Facebook account. Not least because of all the data security 'issues' surrounding the organisation.The device I had wasn't exactly springing to life either, so prepare to have to troll through dozens of time consuming and often confusing You Tube videos in order to find out how to actually switch it on. Also, be prepared to have to download several external software applications and have time set aside to endlessly fiddle with settings whilst fighting off Facebook intrusion.My advice, don't buy it. Wait for an alternative plug and play version to be released by a reputable manufacturer.

Some general advice:Clarity is amazing on the device providing your eye position is on the sweet spot; blurriness and astigmatism does happen if the headset drifts. Elite strap helps with the stability and weight balancing (would wait until they fix their current issues though).There are 2 types of lenses used in manufacture. Make sure the lenses have a crystal like shine to them and the lines within are not just white when a torch is shined in. Look for blemishes and scratches.Don't play with the hinged sides too much as a friend says it caused the speaker to start buzzing when loose.Don't constantly pull out the cushion interface frame as it has been known to fitigue and come off easily woth overuse.Quality control is not great I've heard but if this is your first headset, its still an amazing experience regardless; chances of getting a dud is low looking at the reviews.Very pleased with the headset otherwise; I put the warnings first as I feel people will assume the product to be hardy but extra care is required for longevity. Games on the Quest are expensive, so would wait for sales events. Browsing the internet and watching movies feels like being in a cinema, uses are very diverse especially with the ability to play PCVR games with air link providing your PC is VR ready.

I pre ordered and received on release day, after having it for a few months I feel I can write a decent review.I bought this for gaming and had played around a bit on the first Quest but not long enough to really get to grips with it.Very impressed, you have a huge amount of social and communication options, not only is it great for gaming but also most social activities and in lockdown, it really does come into it's own. You can watch films together in the Big Screen app (virtually sit in a cinema with friends or family), you can do activities, play games in Rec Room or other similar apps, have a meeting, go fishing, fitness, the list is really endless and great fun to actually see the person you know, move and react in this environment.It can also be utilised for work as well which would make it mega fun and a great way to communicate in a meeting. Definitely some great options to assist all types of people struggling to communicate better in lockdown.From a gaming perspective, there's a good choice of games which is growing almost daily. The User Interface is easy to use and fairly similar to the Xbox, pretty easy to get around.Oculus have recently made it easier for independent game developers to publish third party games onto their store which is great, it means that games are only going to get better in the long term.The graphics are decent enough for the money, I would liken it to the Nintendo Switch quality, easily good enough and when you experience it so close up and you're immersed into what you are doing, it's very convincing.Multiplayer options like Echo VR, Blaston, Arizona Sunshine are fantastic playing side by side with your friends in multiplayer,  it's such an awesome experience.Battery life is decent but you can easily connect a portable battery to the unit with a third party strap and case to the back of the head or belt line, which I have now done and gives you hours and hours of extra playing time. Probably more than you need!Battery life on the controllers is excellent, for what you get from one double AA battery in each controller is pretty impressive ! Probably about 50 hours gaming time.The head strap itself is okay for short periods but a little more could have been spent on this to make it more comfortable. The Elite strap is well worth getting, otherwise your head feels like it's being pressured around the back after a while of using.You also get a glasses attachment that sits in just before the lens, this is really useful as just provides enough space for you to have your glasses on.The whole 'sickness' thing doesn't affect me too much but it can with some people who suffer with travel sickness or vertigo type problems. The Rollercoaster app/game does set me off after a while but nothing else really other than that.Also love that you can cast what you are seeing through the Oculus, on to the TV, tablet or phone. You can do this via the Oculus app on a phone or tablet, or you can cast it to a Chromecast or similar streaming device to a TV, which is great as then it becomes even more social for people that are with you.Overall I would say totally worth the £399 for the 256gb, if you're spending that kind of money then the £100 to upgrade from the 64gb version seems like a no brainer.

I bought this as a like for like replacement for the Rift S.  Right off the bat the default strap is bad, like shockingly bad.  You either need some sort of padding for the back (which you can purchase), the elite strap or one of the aftermarket straps to make this thing sit comfortably on your head, the default strap basically makes it feel like your head is participating in some strange bondage fetish with the headset itseful doubling as someone sitting on your face.  Coming from the rift s halo strap this is a definite area.The other major complaint I have is that the battery life is fairly anemic (two hours +/-, your usage might vary).  Due to the nature of Li-Ion batteries I expect this to further degrade over time.  You'll almost certainly have to run this tethered to the pc or to a battery bank.To the rest though, visual quality is definitely better, responsiveness is good, unit is smaller than the rift 2 and more importantly the price point is very very good.  I'd say if you are looking to do what I did and replace the Rift S then the 64GB version is fine, the 256GB one is a lot of overkill.What made me pull the trigger finally on this one is the fact that you no longer need to sideload the VR Desktop software, with this you can literally seemlessly stream VR over your wifi from your pc.  In the next few months Oculus will replace this with Air link so it will just get better.  To be able to play any VR game without any wires is just a game changer for me.Lastly I was also pleasantly surprised at some of the quality of life improvements to the headset, namely the ability to double tab the side of the headset to activate pass-through, it's amazing to be able to quickly switch this on and off when needed.Summary: Now the only reason I gave this 4/5: low battery and the crap-tastic og strap, seriously what were they thinking with that pos.

I have been following the VR space since the original Oculus Rift was announced and I was always planning on getting a headset but the restrictive price kept me from taking the plunge. I finally gave in and got the Oculus Quest 2 just after Christmas.In the box, you get the headset, controllers, two batteries, charging adapter and the glasses spacer, which is what you need to get started. The inclusion of a microfibre cloth or lens guard would have been appreciated, but at this point, everyone has these lying around the house.The headset does not come with a link cable (sold separately) to connect your headset to your PC. Whilst this might be a downside for people wishing to play games from their Steam or Rift libraries, it will not stop you from enjoying VR. You can download games* from the Oculus store and install them on the headset itself. These tend to take up a lot of space, so I would recommend getting the 256GB variant.Unlike the previous Quest, there has been some ""downsizing"" when it comes to some quality of life features, such as the removal of the external lens distance slider in favour of a simpler system whereby the user simply pushes the lenses closer or further apart. In my case, this hasn't been such a big issue, as I only had to set it up at the beginning and haven't touched them since.There are integrated speakers in the headset which for my situation are more than enough. There is a 3.5mm headphone jack on the headset for using headphones. I have found that the integrated speakers are better for me as it allows me to hear my environment and helps with my orientation.The included strap is decent, I haven't had issues with it falling off, but I am considering upgrading to the elite strap simply for the added support and the battery upgrade. Currently, it lasts for just under 2 hrs on a charge.In terms of quality, there is a slight blur around the edge of the display, but this is only noticeable when viewing stationary menus. I have not noticed it in-game at all.There are no external sensors as the tracking is done by the headset, but you will need to be in a well-lit environment for the best results. Keep in mind that for some games, you will need more space (up to 6ft x 6ft) to move around.Overall, whilst the games offered cover a wide range of experiences, I found these to be a bit expensive for what they are. All games in the Oculus library have a Comfort Rating which ranges from Comfortable to Intense. If you're new to VR, then start with the pre-installed tutorials and then the Comfortable. Some games have given me motion sickness.I thoroughly enjoy my Quest 2 and all things considered, I believe it is a very good headset to get started in VR. The screens are good, the tracking is spot on and the immersion is unlike anything I've tried so far.

An amazing introduction to the VR world. Just charge it up, put the headset on, adjust the straps for comfort and power on. Everything is guided, with amazing work going into the tutorials on how to set stuff up and navigate through the wealth of media available; games, exercise programs, films, music, 3D video, exploration, art and design, hang-out rooms... and more.The way things ""work"" on the Quest 2 is just mind-bogglingly good, it feels ""seamless"" and the coordination between headset and hand grips is as perfect as I've ever used, and enable you to interact with your VR environment in such a way as to make you believe that you are actually there.I've actually found that VR Table Tennis is my favourite thing ever.If you want to try VR, you can't really go wrong with this.

Was half and half about getting this given the expense - I'm not a gamer and other than crash bandicoot on the ps1 about 20 years ago have no experience. Yet this has completely lived up to my expectations and exceeded them.  So many options depending on what you like - you can play all types of ""proper"" games - driving, shooting, fantasy etc. Or use it to do 3d tours around the world. Or watch your favourite films on a giant screen. Or use it for relaxing/meditation. Use it for interacting with people from all over the world. Use it to keep fit and do all sorts of workouts from boxing to dancing. I've heard some people even use it for collaborative workspaces although personally I wouldn't be comfortable keeping the headset on for so long.Only reason I haven't given full stars is because the headset isn't hugely comfortable and battery life isn't amazing - but you can buy extras to help with both of those.Would highly advise anyone thinking of buying one to give it a go.And final advice - get a code from a friend who already has an occulus or just go on occulus social media sites and someone will give you one - this will give you 23 pounds (if in uk) towards buying games which is very handy - however you MUST claim the code (by downloading the occulus app on your phone then clicking the referral code they send you) BEFORE turning on your occulus headset for the first time.

I may have received a faulty unit. More often than is acceptable the Quest randomly switches off or the screen goes completely black and then I need to keep restarting till I can see the screen.  Also it randomly loses tracking midway through games.  I rarely use it now because I am absolutely fed up of the issues with it switching of randomly and I have worries about future purchases.  There are periods where it would go days without any issues so not sure if I can even  return it back as faulty because it may appear fully useable when checked.  When it's working it really is the very good and at the price it should be working well all the time or at least the vast majority of the time.  I recently received a text for Facebook code Laz+nxCarLW, after searching this and finding it was about a Facebook hack, I checked my logged devices and on the day I received the message someone in Bristol had logged into my FB account on an oculus quest 2. On top of being really concerned it annoys me that Facebook/Oculus Quest user requirements has got someone hacking my account to use their device, and on top of that I could not find anywhere to report this to Oculus.  I have now removed my payment method on my Quest and I am scared of making future purchases.

The Oculus/Meta quest 2 - Facebook/Meta’s current leading headset being sold to the masses.An amazing VR headset capable of running VR games standalone using it’s modded Snapdragon 865/Qualcomm XR2 chip or playing them linked to a computer, wirelessly and with a wire.Using its inside out tracking with a 6DOF, it can track on all axis: Roll, yaw, pitch, X, Y and Z meaning you can move and look around realistically and almost entirely life like.In future there may even be full body tracking support, using mirrors and the cameras which sounds promising as right now, the quest 2 already features very functional hand tracking.The Quest 2 on it’s own is capable of running games like VRChat and beat sabre consistently at 72fps, if you choose to increase the refresh rate it can potentially hit 80fps and 90fps on moderate worlds in VRChat and less demanding games like beat sabre.A sleek design and surprisingly light weight, the headset itself has no issues aesthetically, it looks and feels pleasing.With a 1832x1920 per eye resolution the image is crisp and clear, standalone and linked to a computer; though, with a computer you can bring out the full potential of the headset, using its 120hz feature and fully utilising the maximum resolution of the headset you can’t get a better experience for the price.However;There are caveats to this.As an amazing headset as it is, it is still cheap in comparison to the rest, and this should be noted.The saying goes “You get what you pay for.” and this is true even here.The quest 2 has a very very short charging cable which cannot be used for linking to a computer outside of sitting down, it works at around 300-400mbps so it is completely capable of being used as a link cable but it does not do it flawlessly all the time, with this bit rate you are limited in visual fidelity.As you can adjust the bit rate to be higher in the Oculus debug tool, this cable won’t allow you to go much higher than 250 which provides very little impact in image quality compared to the default 150; I find myself scaling it up to 500 to see a noticeable change, as below this the compression is very real.Any cable that is USBC 3.1 or 3.2 will work just fine for link but the faster and more well built ones will work far better, the one I use is capable of 2.9GBPS (2900mbps) and works quite well, but even then there are still some compression artifacts.On the note of linking, some computers (desktops specially as any laptop I have tried which supports USBC charges the headset fine) do not charge the headset when linked, this is a motherboard power distribution issue as some do not distribute enough power to the ports to charge the headset, most are 5-10watts which will not charge the headset and instead let it slowly drain.In my case mine did not charge at all, it is not an issue of motherboard quality, some just do not give enough power.I use a 850w gold Corsair PSU on a ASUS B550F and found this to be an issue however, with my laptops I did not.On top of this, most laptops will not run the games you wish to play at higher than 45FPS.There are exceptions like beat sabre and other east to run games but at that point you’d be using the headset standalone rather than linked, using the link you’d be wanting to play boneworks, blade and sorcery or VRChat.The minimum spec I found to run these games smoothly at 72/80fps was a 1660 and 12GB of DDR4 2400/2666 ram on a recent 4 core cpu (I5 8th/9th Gen or a Ryzen 5)You can alternatively up the refresh rate to 120hz and make use of the 60fps space warp but in my experience it does not warp correctly, as 60fps is perceived as relatively smooth by the eye anyway the space warp creates issues.You can turn it off in settings but it does not help much either way on or off.If you cannot meet the 72fps target your best bet is 90hz and running 45FPS with space warp enabled.There have been rumours of a new space warp being released that works far better which would help many users but how true it is I’m unsure.Now for 90fps and 120fps, my 1080ti and Ryzen 7 3700X can barely keep up.For boneworks and such there is no issue, adaptive resolution can help there but, for games like vrchat it struggles heavily on maximum resolution.I find myself tuning it down to about 1700 per eye to hit 90fps and 1400 per eye for 120fps.This is just for link, with air link you may have a better experience using a RTX card as they have better encoders than my 1080ti however, I’ve found I can hardly run 72fps on virtual desktop half the time, I use a 5ghz 1gbps router that is almost always unclogged, granted I’m over wifi and not using ethernet, your experience may be better than mine.I don’t have complaints for air link other than how poor it runs sometimes; it will occasionally stutter heavily because of frame rate fluctuations, not because of my router.Air link runs better than virtual desktop but still has its issues along with far more noticeable compression.The head strap is quite comfortable contrary to popular belief, it’s just a bit hard to fit right and get comfortable in, people recommend you use the top strap to adjust it and not the back strap unless you want it tight but in my experience the headset ends up slipping off my head if I do not use the back strap tight to my skull, the top strap pushes it up my head and will cause it to fall off slowly.I recommend using a combination of both, but keeping the strap at the back somewhat loose but tight enough it won’t let your headset shake around.Alongside this, the headsets facial interface creaks very quickly, within a week of light usage mine began to sort of rub against the plastic and make a creaking sound.This seems like it’s inevitable but it should not happen so soon, by product of a cheap headset.But as for complaints that is all.Thrill seeker throughly stress tested his quest 2 and even dropped it from 10ft and it lived, it’s durability is not a concern, but the interface is a very big weak point, even in his video it was the first thing to break.If you’re curious of the video I’m talking about, you can find it on YouTube: “Thrillseeker quest 2 extreme torture test”I think this concludes my review.TLDR;Amazing headset, cheap price, works good alone, works good on link and air link but needs good specs minimum i5 8th gen/Ryzen 5 and GTX 1660 for a smooth experience, facial interface gives in after a while, headset is light and comfy, appearance is nice.

The Quest 2 connects to the Wifi then detects it needs a Software update, downloads and applies it. once applied the quest 2 can no longer detect Wifi Networks so is useless. Oculus tried to help but could not fix it.so returned for a refund. There is a fundamental problem with the software update turning the headset into a brick.

I bought this headset to use with my PC, first mistake, this Quest 2 seems better as a standalone ""console"" than something to use with a PC, after jumping through many Meta-hoops just to get the thing working, faffing around with mobile apps that failed to work, not telling you ya had to enable Bluetooth, desktop mode was unusable at best as the screen kept going black, finally getting into MS flight simulator, its was ok.. but unless I did something wrong, I got a simulation of the perspective of someone without their glasses on, it was too blurry to read any of the dials despite being on the highest graphics..It's not a bad product despite the many claws Zuckerberg has on this, its just not a great headset for PC.Also, you don't need one of their £89 Link cables, any USB 3 cable will work the same, just make sure its long enough for your needs.

I can't reccomend this enough to people, I've spend so many hours gaming and watching movies on this headset.I was always on the fence due to being worried about motion sickness.All I can say is some games make you feel alittle funny but you get used to it.I even take it to work as a hgv driver for nights out as I can chill in my cab and watch Netflix/amazon movies on a 200""+ screen in my truck10/10 just pure brilliant

The fan vibrates that badly the vibration travels across the rigid elite strap and into my headphones. So all i can hear is a constant fan hum unless i turn sound all the way up.I wish they used just a little bit of copper in the heatsink or a vapor chamber to help draw heat away faster so the fan didn't have to work so hard. I understand they did this because copper weighs more than aluminium.I don't get why they don't put the weight on top of your forehead like the Rift-S/PSVR headsets. I get it will make the headset bigger but comfort should be more important than portability. It's not like the Rift-S is not portable you just need to put it inside a bigger case. Problem solved but the comfort issue is harder to solve.Would i still recommend the headset for new VR users YES! But if you can get the Quest1 with better build quality for cheaper get the Quest1.I asked FB to delete my account years ago i setup a new one just for VR today. I will never be logging into Facebook to post or interact with anyone outside of VR. So FB can try to profile me as much as they want they will get zero info from merging the two accounts other than my VR usage.Also to address a current myth you don't have to play most VR games standing. I play all of my games sat down and just move my hands about.

I had previously owned a Rift so when they announced Rift and Rift S were not going to be supported I bought a Quest 2.Its lighter than the Rift and the headset had built in tracking which is a godsend as the bane of my life was cables for the rift and then tracking stations which never worked properly.With this its easy to set up and use and you can put games directly onto it or run them through a wireless desktop link if you need a more powerful machine which is cool and still no wires.My mine issues are the battery life is not great, secondly the eye spacers dont work fully and it means you have a bit of visual distortment, almost ruins the experience as I want to feel immersed.Then there are a few games but not enough in a modern resolution for my liking.I love the warhammer game, but the Graphics feel like they should be back in early 2000.  We need more content and better immersive graphics.Hopefully in time it will come

The headset and controllers are well built, that first time you put it on and see it if you are new to VR it’s simply stunning.The app is well laid out and simple to use, including plenty of free games (vr chat is one of the best) and watching experiences.Beat saber is a must have in terms of paid games.My only real gripe is the actual head strap is awful, you will soon have issues with it not fitting well, slipping and causing neck pain. Would have been better to ship with the elite strap and pay more as for a long session the original is not good enough and for personal safety and health it would just make more sense.Overall though it’s fantastic and was well worth the cost.

I work in tech but not with VR so I'm not sure what I expected but I didn't expect it to be this good. The technology isn't perfect by any means, getting you eyes in the sweet spot can be a bit tricky, and the edge of you vision is usually a bit blurry but that doesn't detract from how cool this is. I'm not mainly using this for gaming but rather viewing films and connecting to a PC for a big and multi screen experience. WFH is much more fun when it feels like a spacious mountain cabin rather than a small back bedroom. The negatives: Facebook! I really don't like Facebook knowing everything I'm doing in VR it's just creepy. The headset could be lighter and less bulky and more comfortable. If you buy, budget in for a better strap and an external battery, and a tracked keyboard if you want to work in VR.

OK so I've had these for a little while now about 5/6 months and the first thing I'd like to note you have to have a Facebook account and connect it through use of your phone or laptop/pc and also you have to install and or buy everything so make sure you expect to spend money and download the app as that's how you buy and download now.The graphics and game play obviously depends on the games but practically a 3d version of 4k. And the sound quality is OK but I prefer speakers.And the battery life isn't great but atleast you can get 2-4 hours before the battery dies (depending on the game) and the strap around the head can be awkward with I guys is why they brought out a pack for extra battery and headstrap.All in all good product and arrived on time, great for all ages (again depending on what games you buy) as long as atleast 1 person has their Facebook connected then anyone can play on it.

The games are more interesting & get me off my sofa. I like the games pricing & Oculus unit price compared to everything else. Meta created something tremendous here. Look up how to wear the headset comfortably. There's a trick by tilting the headstrap that will affect the weight of it on your cheekbones & focus. I struggle wearing my glasses in it, but am near-sighted so I don't really need them with the unit being strapped practically onto my eyeballs. I'm glued to Wander, which has immersively permitted me to travel the world. Vader Immortal lets me immersively star in a Star Wars movie, where I got to train with & fight beside Darth Vader. It had extremely well-observed character voice, fight choreography, & animation.I bought the whole series.My husband and I enjoy Beat Saber immensely. It comes with many songs, but you can buy more by the song or the album. I read more songs are coming out with new and unusual beat maps.My father loves his Quest 2 as well & plays Resident Evil 4. My cousin & I play Gun Club VR. If you like rollercoasters there are megacoaster games which I can't play because I get cybersickness. I did 4 coasters and satisfied my curiosity. There are even bad B movies and immersive A-list movie experiences you can get in the middle of.Watching movies and accessing VR Netflix & Amazon Prime Video is more interesting. You're always in a movie theater & some apps let you expand the screen size to IMAX dimensions. You get the theater all to yourself.You only need a clear spot on your floor to use the Quest 2. The refresh rate is 90Hz, if I'm right, everything looks real. My mind struggles to tell the difference between reality and VR, I sometimes feel heat where I get strafed by laser bolts on my arms & legs in Vader Immortal.You can Chromecast, record video for Facebook, or take a picture of anything in the Quest 2. For Christmas I Chromecasted to my TV & asked my parents for their childhood home addresses, then I used Wander to go there & show them their homes & honetowns. My husband was able to go with ne in Wander with his Quest 2, we went to his parents' home in 2018 when it was a sunny day, the roses were in bloom, & his father was still alive.The Oculus Quest 2 has given us something nothing else could.

I was put off for a long time from buying this by the requirement to join facebook as mandatory. I broke and joined facebook to get one of these and I absolutely dont regret it. You can play all the vr games from the app store, enjoy immersive ad educational 3d travel experiences. You can plug it into a pc (as long as its powerful enough) and play steam games over wifi and data link. I think this could be a game changer for widespread vr adoption.

This was my first experience of a VR headset.... and it is amazing.  The fact that you can do this using a standalone headset is fantastic.  The headset is comfortable even using the stock head band supplied.... but I am sure that can be improved by those offered by other 3rd parties.  I wear prescription glasses but the VR effect was still great, but did reduce the wearing time.  I will be ordering prescription lenses that can fit over the Quest 2 lenses to avoid me having to wear my specs.  The battery time is OK but I will be reviewing options to improve this.  I will be also investigating how to use it for PC VR games etc.  by link-cable/wireless connectivity in due course ... once I make my PC VR ready!  but there is a decent amount of free and relatively inexpensive material on SideQuest and other sources.

My experience with this Oculus it's for the most part regarding comfort. The device is excellent, easy to set up, easy and intuitive to use. My opinion is that it's actually too heavy for the elastic adjustable default strap. It definitely needs more support. Every now and so often (too often to my liking) I need to adjust the position of the Oculus on my face as the vision gets blurred. It's something that happens every five minutes, if I'm playing a very chilled game such as fishing, but if I start playing something in which I have to move more, such as beat saber, these adjustments are happening more often. Obviously investing in such a device it's going to be worth it also investing in a better support. Any another experience that I've had so far with this device is to be considered absolutely positive.

I have been into VR for over 4 years. My first headset was the Rift, and I loved it but time had come to 'upgrade' and so I decided to get the Quest 2 256gb, and I wasn't disappointed. It arrived quickly and well packaged, I love the sleek design and it fits pretty well. The resolution is fantastic, a huge step up from my Rift. The apps are okay, but very limited, however, once I connected my headset to my PC I was able to run all my games which I played through the Rift, and so no problem. Overall, very pleased indeed, and the price is excellent. My only issue is the standard head strap which comes with the Quest is not very good and the head set keeps sliding down my face and sitting on my nose. I knew this could be an issue and so I had already bought an Elite head strap and fitted that.

i’m a PC gamer, i wanted to try out something new and some of my games are VR capable.. Assetto Corsa 2, Euro Truck Simulator 2 and quite a few other titles..this has happened on many occasions over both my PC Tower and Laptop with very respectable hardware, sometimes using Rift Link (software in the Quest 2/Oculus Windows app to allow you to play on PC) out of nowhere just completely stops working, even with factory resets, restarts, turning devices off and on, driver updates, software updates and disabling specific things or enabled specific things, using different USB 3.0 cables that pass the bandwidth test 2.5Gbps+ and still nothing works.i’ve managed to fix it many times in the past but now the headset/software is just not having any of it. my experience with this headset is just abysmal. negatives way outweigh the positives (especially when you can’t use the headset!!)Oculus support is useless, telling me Windows 11 isn’t supported, blah, blah blah.. when it’s worked fine in the past and for lots of people on W11 it works fine, same problems occur on Windows 10 as well.i’ve gone all over the internet and tried most fixes that i can see, but no luck. these issues appear out of nowhere, but never fix themselves.not to mention the terrible experiences trying to use FaceBook to sign in, absolute joke.(for those interested, my laptop specs are: i9-12900H, 3070Ti, 32GB DDR5 4800mhz)(PC Tower specs: Ryzen 7 3700x, GTX 1660Ti, 16GB DDR4 3200mhz)

First off, before you consider buying one of these, if you own a desktop computer, you owe it to yourself to buy a USB 3.0 type A to type C cable (now called USB 3.2 Gen 1, just to be confusing), or a decent Wi-Fi 6 router if you intend to go the air-link route, in order to use desktop VR.Otherwise, this headset is an absolutely fantastic standalone unit capable of playing some decent titles independently of a desktop, with some of the best tracking I've yet tried in a headset.The one downside you'll face is that your oculus account is tied to Facebook, and Facebook has a tendency to be a bit trigger-happy with account deletions and permanent bans, which to a degree seems to be teething pains from entering the gaming space.

It's an okay headset. This headset has many annoying difficulties that make the headset one to beat. One of my main annoyances is the fact that the headset isn't recognised as a Windows mixed reality headset and on order to use the Oculus link function properly you need to enable the test channel beta option. Make sure that all of the beta buttons in the settings are enabled otherwise you won't be able to full utilize the headset. Add that to the terrible customer service from Oculus and you've got one headset with flaws. Another annoyance is the fact that Facebook don't realise why people choose to use virtually headsets. Who wants to be forced to log into Facebook before you can even use the headset. I've spoken to Facebook Oculus about this issue many times. To which they can't answer, add that to the fact that Facebook said that they'd never fully merge with Oculus. Back when they first launched the headset range. Not going to buy from them again. I wouldn't really recommend this headset to anyone really. At least until they sort out these issues.

If you want to get into VR, at this price point it is fantastic.I bought this as a second headset to my Valve index, mostly because my mate was getting one who i used to play online with on PSVR and since i went to PCVR we no longer were able to.For the price it is amazing, very clever, easy to use and with so many games and experiences at your fingertips it really does tick the VR boxes.It will never replace my index and is not as good, when reading text i never seem to be able to quite hit the sweet spot on clarity, it's fine in game so not an issue.The stock sound is not as terrible as all the reviews lead you to believe, its not great but it does the job, if you want more, plug a set of headphones in.Tracking is good and games look completely fine and play very well. Add the fact it is wireless and don't need a PC, then this really is great value.So will it replace my index? No, in the way a Fiat 500 would not replace a Bentley. They do basically the same job, and the Quest 2 does it at a fraction of the cost but it does not do it quite as well as a Valve index with a high end PC. £299 or in my case £2999 (Index and very high end PC) the Quest really does make good sense.

I am sure others love this item, but I just can't get excited about it. I was hoping for more content, and the Youtube app is terrible. The games on offer are over priced and not good quality, but that is only my opinion. When using this for an hour or two I get eye strain. I've had to buy special lenses because I wear spectacles, which cost a lot of money, but they made no difference on the eye strain issue. There is much glare on the lenses as well. I also noticed incompatability issues (such as videos not opening in VR and unable to exit) with certain websites in VR. Battery life is okay, usually 3 hours, but probably less for gaming.

I have my Oculus Rift (Original) stored away with it's 3 extra cameras and collection of 3m wires, I haven't touched it in over a year simply because it's a pain to setup and has so many requirements.The Quest 2 on the otherhand blows the Rift out of the water, and it sold cheaper than what the Rift was at launch.Linking the Quest 2 to the PC for Oculus & Steam VR is very easy and you don't even need a cable since 'AirLink' works like a charm within the same household.

The headset is good and works as intended. The hardware and software are fine(I'll get into that later). If you see yourself using it a lot, I suggest getting better accessories for it. Like a better headstrap and knuckle grips for controllers. 128gb is more than enough for games, since most games will be under 5gb big, so if you are using PCVR and play most games on that, I suggest getting the 64gb version if available and a bigger cable. Eye PD adjustment is lacking, but good enough for most users. Battery lasts around 2 hours and charges about an hour, cheapest way to increase play time is getting a battery bank and placing it in your pocket.So, about the software. I'm not fond of Meta(facebook), but setup is easy and quite quick, which is good if you like to move your play space from room to room. Would be nice if it recognizes your play spaces and saves them, when you back. UI is good and understandable, some setting are hidden away in experimental features or under developer settings. So, overall good software. What bothers me is that Meta is able to disable your headset, if you break their guidelines. Which is unlikely, but frightening to think about, since I paid ~350€ for it + accessories and facebook has the power to disable, which makes it into a paperweight along with any games you've purchased.I've seen a post where somebody had unlocked the headset, which means you are basically able to do anything with the headset and I hope in the future, it can be accessed by anyone.So, all in all. If you want to get an affordable headset and don't thing you will face the problems I listed above, It is a great purchase for anyone!

When u buy something on the oculus website and you come to use it. It comes up with a errors and doesn’t tell you how to solve it. You get to the point of spending most of ur time searching forums to work out what the problem is and the amount of technical know how you need to figure out, you almost feel you need a degree in computing.Games - not all games are compatible even though this is the latest device.

I wanted to get into VR as it’s definitely a growing market in gaming with loads of awesome games now, but the my PC isn’t fast enough to support a wired VR headset like the Rift. Making the Quest a very nice option as a first time VR experience and making it very portable to use as my room has limited space so being able to take it into any space I like (just not outside in the sun) is pretty cool. First time use was good with setting up my Facebook account and loading up the Oculus demos to get adjusted to VR.If anyone is reading this and is thinking of getting any VR set and you have glasses. Please use the glasses spacer provided in the box, I stupidly assumed because I was near sighted that I wouldn’t need that and my eyes would be fine looking at a screen closeup. I was so wrong, just by putting on my long distance glasses the screen was instantly sharper and I could focus on 3D objects much better. I should have done it from the start so don’t do what I did!I get why people complain about the strap that is included with the Quest and I’ll say it isn’t that bad. Sure it doesn’t offer the best comfort of secure ness on your head for the quest but they had to cut a cost somewhere right. For me, i haven’t found it unbearable and haven’t seen a need to upgrade to the elite strap. Maybe in the future I’ll get one and look back on the pain the original strap caused unknowingly.PCVR does work well with the headset. I can’t say too much on it though as my pc can barely run VR titles. However, if you don’t want the official oculus cable as it is so expensive. Their are plenty of alternatives on this site which will do fine at a much lower cost.The 4K screen does make for a very clear and fun experience with bring the reality of the game world closer. The IPD adjustment is limited though to three options so anyone with a specific liking that is not an option here might find it a deal breaker if you already have a Rift or Quest 1.The battery life is short. Running a VR capable PC on your face does not make it surprising that even playing beat saber which is not a demanding VR title will last you to 2  - 2 and half hours. Oculus does sell the elite strap with a battery pack included to extend that to 5-6 but there are ways to extend it with your own battery pack and a simple hack of Velcro attachment or keeping it in your pocket while playing. I would recommend looking up what batter packs are best for the quest and the different methods of ensuring the battery is not damaged in the short term.Overall, I Would definitely recommend for a first timer or experienced VR enthusiast if you want portability and decent performance that doesn’t come at a ridiculous cost. Yes this might not have all the VR capabilities some people may want, but if your like me who doesn’t have a BR capable PC but still wants the experience than I would definitely give this a look!

Bought this as a surprise, thinking I could join my other half in his favourite VR game. He was really excited but before we opened it, he had me try his existing headset a couple of times just in case. Turns out this is really hard to use if you wear glasses! Just couldn't get his set to sit comfortably AND not be blurry and then the headaches started, so I've had to return this one because it's going to give me migraines. Thank goodness we checked before opening it up, otherwise a very expensive mistake.

After reading a lot of the negative Amazon reviews I was skeptical about my purchase, with common themes being locked out of your Facebook account or locked out of your device and how much invasive information is required to sign up.However I found the setup to be super straight forward and easy, yes it requires a Facebook account but it didn't ask for any invasive details. The overall gameplay is immersive. Definitely worth every penny.

I find it difficult to recommend or play my own Quest 2 with the fact the platform is designed to make it harder than ever for developers and communities to build experiences on the Quest. It is designed solely for extracting money out of you.Don't get me wrong, it's fantastic that we have standalone VR that is relatively cheap, but I'd probably wait for a while longer still, at least until Facebook is forced to give up some of its control over the platform back to users.

Never been a gamer and only really bough this for the kids to play with. I'm sorry, they don't get a look in! I'm being drawn to the immersive gameplay like I never thought I would be. I get why gamers like what they do, for the first time ever (I'm 50!). I can't cope with some games and get seriously travel sick and need to lie down in a dark room for a while. But I've learned to play only games that allow 'teleporting' and that has solved the problem. I know this isn't as good a quality headset as some others, but they cost several times the price. I know it's from Facebook and there are questions over privacy, but just don't tell them much. Love it - get one!

The screen specs alon are really good, with the most recent firmware it goes up to 120hz, at that resolution it makes games so much smoother to play. Also the brightness of the screen is really good, though the lens like to glare when you look at white objects, looking a lot like bloom. The controllers are solid and comfortable to hold, the batteries they come with last a suprsing time, and the battery cover never pops off on its own. The tracking is sometimes iffy on the controllers since its dependant on the light level in your room, but other than that its fine. The analogue sticks are sturdy and dont drift, and when you use the headset in the standalone mode you can enable hand tracking, meaning you dont need to use controllers.As for the PC experience, if you dont buy the official link cable you gotta pay attention to the cable standard, as some wont charge the device when using link mode meaning you will have to charge every so often. plus its best to hang the cable off the ceiling as the tension of the cable can press on your face and dig the headset into your cheeks which hurts a lot. id recomend also getting some straps for the controllers and a better facecover as the stock one is horrible to wear once youre sweaty.

So the headset still works great even after a year. The left controller however has not seen such luck and no longer works. Which either makes games significantly less enjoyable to play or just full on unable to play as they require use of both hands. Otherwise tho, really fun and good value for money :)Edit: I’ve managed to get the controller working again. I simply used the oculus app to disconnect both controllers and put in rechargeable batteries before reconnecting them again, that seemed to do the trick (for now anyways)Sometimes the controllers won’t properly register some actions but for the price of the headset compared to other VR headsets, its not bad.Also, just a nitpick, but it would be nice to be able to have a discord app for the oculus. But that’s more personal preference. Anyways have a good one lads :)

Quest 2 is a brilliant headset for VR no computer needed  at all just a phone to download content onto it  Headset is quite compatible and basic but the resolution and tracking are first rate for the price. Controllers are also really comfortable to use. Did not give this 5 stars though as the accessories for it the elite headstrap and the case are not so good the straps break easily it would seem and the case quality just is not there. Piece of string to operate its zip.Don't be put off the headset itself is great and other straps can fit it. The original strap is adequate. The only other thing is that it appears FACEBOOK can disable your headset if you break their rules,  or for no reason at all if you are unlucky

Having issues with motion sickness caused by previous VR experiences, I was hesitant to buy myself a VR headset. Gladly I did and discovered that I can play most of the games actually available on the Quest store.I do still have problems with those games that are listed as ""comfort: moderate or heavy"", but luckily the store offers lots of games that are considered ""comfortable"" and don't cause me motion sickness.I do recommend sticking with those if you have my same issue.Great product overall, even being a standalone version (no PC required), I am happy with my purchase!

I've played this nearly every day since I've had it. I use Virtual Desktop to stream from my PC over WiFi and I use a decent powerbank to give it many hours more juice so I don't need to worry about getting tangled in any cables. Some of the games are so much fun, it's easy to lose yourself in them. Been playing table tennis and also mini golf; they feel so realistic it's unbelievable! Definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in proper immersion!

For what it is its enjoyable but I find it lacking with ideas & options.I would expect some movies to be viewed on the Oculus but no, it's only what they provide which is not much.Most games cost between £10 - £30 which is OK but if you're not a gamer, the Oculus Quest 2 becomes a £300 pair of 3D glasses as the novelty quickly wears off because of the lack of ideas & software so I hope it improves before I sell it on.

I bought the Quest 2 for the birthday of my son. The birthday is actually 3 weeks later but I opened the package - ""just for checking purposes"" :)))) LOL... I was really blown away by the nice 3D effect. I felt just WOW! The price is quite good for the delivered hardware and software. I already bought several software packages (Oculus and Steam) to give him the BEST BIRTHDAY GIFT EVER!!! I have no doubt about that.I love 3D games and the hard and software is finally good enough to dive into the 3D world. Attention: The battery could last longer. Please consider to buy a fixation for an additional powerbank. You will need the extra power because the 3D World is really captivating!!!!No question... I would buy again the Oculus Quest 2

This is my first VR set, and I have had it for two weeks now. Yes, it requires a Facebook account (which I dislike a lot - I have neither WhatsApp nor FB), having said that, the device is truly amazing. With the new version 28 update, it now can link to your (gaming) computer wirelessly so you can play PC VR games as well as the lighter weight Quest 2 games that play straight from the headset. I got lucky for having timed my entry so well, but it shows they are actively pushing updates to improve it. I highly recommend it despite the Facebook account issue.

Overall it's a very good experience, but for some reason the headstrap seemed very grubby straight out of the box. More importantly, I have a dead pixel of the left side and I'm not sure if I should ask for a replacement or if this is a better the devil you know situation (I.e. would I receive a replacement with different problems).It's also worth mentioning that a replacement head strap will be something to consider when budgeting for this as you'll probably want/need one for better comfort down the line. I've only had my Quest 2 for just over a week and I've already decided that the headstrap that comes with the Quest as standard isn't really up to the job if you're moving around much.

But this is not the case, the VR is rocksolid there are a huge number of games available. Who would’ve thought that the next step in wearable computing would be so cheap?

What is not to love about progressing with the future of gaming with one of the most immersive vr experiences ever. The battery life really isn't great at times when you're playing some amazing games like population one for hours but that just shows how addictive it can be. Amazing immersion,  amazing product and it has a huge endless list of games available and an amazing modding community that makes it so much better with the additional fan made games/content available. Obviously the Facebook account requirement isn't the best but I rarely use Facebook and have an account just sat there doing nothing. Had no problems using it so far so can't complain.

Amazingly good product for the price. VR games are absolutely amazing - and 3d movies are fantastic. Much superior to the previous model. There is a bit of a learning curve - but don't let the early frustration annoy you, as after a few hours of training with the tutorials you'll find it a breeze. Works extremely well with Steam VR and is not too difficult to set up. Opens up a new world to explore and will bring you  much joy.

This VR headset is amazing! I am in love with it and how easy it is to get into, this is my first time using VR.Only thing while setting it up that I didn't enjoy was entering in long passwords, WiFi and so on.It runs smoothly and it's easy to set up play arias. I've been enjoying sports games and social games on this. And even drawing and videos. All alot of fun.Biggest thing for me that I had to buy a new strap for the headset, its too front heavy and left marks on my forehead and quickly started to hurt.

This is VR working as it should. No wires attached and no need for sensors or other peripherals. The tracking works very well and you can play most of the games either standing or sitting. Very handy when you're short on space. The headset is not too bulky and the weight is light enough for long gaming sessions. I would advise getting the elite strap with the battery pack as the battery life is not as good as I would have hoped. Don't let that put you off though. It does charge fairly quickly so you can soon be back in the game.Well worth the purchase IMHO.

It is a great product that gives you an unmatched experience. I give 2 stars as I had an incident that I am sure a lot of people might have had. While I was playing with headphones, my kid opened the room's door and left it open.  Not knowing that eventually, I hit the handle badly with my fist and needed to have my skin glued as the injury was pretty bad. I think it is easily avoidable if the developers put software that would routinely check (with the external cameras) if new obstacles are introduced in your guardian playing area, as you are completely blind to that while you are with the headset.Apart from the safety - I have to say - if you have time and love playing games - you must try Oculus, it could take your breath away

There's some brilliant 3rd party apps out there!Loads of free stuff to explore via sidequest.As a standalone device it's still amazing, no need to get geeky; it just does everything you want out of the box. 99% of people won't need to touch a computer at all.There's something to like for everyone here, not much to complain about.It will require WiFi/internet to set up and get the most out of it.

The driver was incredible. He told my mum he needed the delivery code but she didng have it and since I'm usually in lunch at this time my mum tried calling me but it had changed and was now a 3,2 split. She got the school to give me a message and I called her in-between lessons, she said she needed the code and the driver had said he would come back later. He came back again and she still didn't have it. So he said he would come back at the end of his round. I looked I my email, screenshotted the code and sent it to me mum. Then, later at 4 o'clock the parcel was delivered and my mum gave him the code. Also the vr headset itself is incredible I am already a huge vr fan after only days.

This hurts too much after half an hour, the elite strap makes it better but still not as comfortable. Also the god rays, blurring of text on the Home Screen is much much worse compared to the quest 1, the sweet spot is very narrow you have to look straight ahead, any slight movement and there is blur, not sure why, quest 1 again not like this when I switch between them.

I absolutely love this thing. There's nothing that hasn't been said already. I use this in conjunction with the app ""Virtual Desktop"" to wirelessly stream my PC to the headset. My PC is VR Ready so I can play SteamVR games with ease and use my computer wirelessly with no drop in quality!The official support for this wireless gameplay has released as ""Airlink"" as of this review, but I have no experience with it. The post release support of this HMD makes it a must-have device. You might not get the fidelity and tracking of a Valve Index, but it's only £400!Having the ability to wirelessly play without a PC is liberating too, Gorilla Tag is a personal favourite of mine and Beat Saber is always good fun to play with others.

This device is a technological marvel that is spoiled by cheap packaging.And it is pretty much unusable for me because of how much uncomfortable the head strap and face cover are.As much as I'm annoyed about this situation, I thought that this poor fit will be possible to fix by buying some different head strap, but the Elite Strap is out of stock and there are no other alternatives.Oculus Rift might is an older device and has lower refresh rates and so on, but at least I can play it for a few hours and have fun, as for Oculus Quest 2 though, I can't even put it on my head, it's either pressing too hard on my face and causes immediate pain or I'm getting a blurry image.

After contacting Oculus support they ran through a few troubleshooting tests, all failed to sort the problem.  Therefore I was advised to return the controller and once received they would send out a replacement ( which I was told may be re-conditioned).I returned this a week ago and I am still waiting for a replacement to be sent.  Extremely frustrated and disappointed.Although a great gaming device I’m not sure it’s worth the hassle as I now predict this may happen again.

I've had several VR headsets over the years including a Samsung Gear VR and a PlayStation VR. Decided on the Quest 2 instead of a PS5, at least for now. The Quest is a big improvement over PSVR both for visuals and tracking. Roomscale is a complete game changer also.Best experiences so far are Within, a Google Street View app, and Bigscreen, which is a social movie theatre. Best games are of course Best Sabre, Rez Infinite and Superhot.Definitely recommended as a way to get out of the house during lockdown.

This year's model pleasantly surprised me with its Everything!!Not to mention the built-in sound, wow!! Despite not being directly over ear, it sounds great!!! And has bass too!!Even the screen-door effect is gone. For me at least.But it's not all milk and honey..... They screwed it up with the IPD adjustment. It's too small for me, and my head starts to hurt... Not to mention the FOV is smaller too. :(((But if your IPD is less than 70mm, then you're good. Mine is higher, that's why... :(

Experience beyond what I thought it would be. Shame in order for it to be comfortable you have to invest in a better head strap. It is famously front heavy and tightening the straps to compensate gives you headaches feom the constant pressure. And to protect it a carry case and other essentials like knuckle grips erc. So your looking to spend about an extra 100 quid in accessories but then it feels like it's worth thousands. Oh and the fact you have to pay for the majority of games in the library is also a little stingy but hey that's the world we live in. For the experience of the virtual reality though 10 out of 10 oh ps you probably need a longer 5 metre or so charging cable so you can play and charge at the same time but not essential if you only plan to use for a couple of hours at a time. And no I don't get a cut of any accessories sold with this device I just think they're needed to get the most from your experience. Hope this helps.

Ive gone an entire week trying to iron out the bugs and seemingly non reported and documented issues of this device. This is the most user-unfriendly device i have ever set my eyes on regarding linking to a pc.Otherwise the on console store is very limited and without developer mode enabled you will be mostly stuck to playing 20 min campaign games, dis-including beatsaber as one of the games on the store that feel worth the price.As I have been seeing progress being made over community reports on fixing issues I don't believe this to be entirely malicious  as a product but I heavily suggest not buying this, in favor of waiting for the next version or just buying something better.

As a standalone device, its good. Read the other reviews if you're interested on the performance, hardware experience etc. It's good overall basically. Its affordable cheap and compared to most devices on the market, it seems lovely. Buttt the one problem is Facebook and oculus.I forgot my oculus password which might not seem like a huge issue, and a quick password reset should fix it right? Nope, it won't send me an email and it's been an issue I think for years. Basically if you forget your password to your oculus account, your account is just gone basically. Luckily I never bought a game on that account, but if I did, well then all that money ould go to waste.It's simple problems with very very very simple solutions to make this something much better this literally has been a known issue for years and it's never bene fixed seriously. I can't even make a ticket request cause I'm not signed in.So basically good but if you forgot your password L to all your stuff

Got these to have an intro into VR, mainly wanting a decent cinema experience - to that end, I’m disappointed.The tech is clearly great, the head and hand tracking is great.For me (a glasses wearer) I just couldn’t get a decent clarity out of them, adjusting just about everything I found I could get a clear image in one spot, as soon as you look away from dead centre it all looses quality, it’s also a fair weight on your head if you wanted to watch a movie.

I upgraded from a Quest 1 and for the most part this headset is an overall improvement. It's not a huge leap over its predecessor but it is a solid upgrade.Pros, higher res screen, far less noticeable screendoor effect, we have adjustable screen brightness again unlike the Quest 1, it's a little lighter and the processor is considerably more powerful although it feels a little under utilised to me so far.Cons, still not a ""comfortable"" weight, the screen is LCD not OLED (but I think the pro's make it worth it), the bundled head strap sucks and should be the first thing you replace on it, battery life is a little worse that the Quest 1's too.The biggest negative remains that its Meta/Facebook but that cant be helped for now since they have the standalone VR market pretty much to themselves.

I like this it is definitely more advanced than my go.I have encountered a few issues though I like to watch YouTube in bed which means a very awkward game of turn the lights on and disable the tracking and then turning the light back off, oh and also removing the battery from the left controller that I don’t use on YouTube otherwise it gets in the way on screen. Then remember that when I shut down I need to play the same game again to use it like my go, so one step forward on screen quality two steps backwards on usability.

I wish I had bought this at the start of the lockdown. It is better than I could have imagined. I am glad I bought the stand alone version - no wires and no checking your pc has the correct gizmos. £400 is a lot of money but I do not regret one penny. A printed manual (even one online) would be useful. For example I have yet to find a way to get out of Youtube VR except for switching the headset off. I have a small issue with steaming the lenses up, but that is probably me as my partner does not. Seems to be loads of free stuff to watch.

Its not possible to continue gameplay while its charging, the cable should have been kept at the length of the original oculus quest.

WOW - what an incredible experience. You can keep your PS5s and XBOXs. This is the future. You do need a Facebook account but who doesn’t have one? I’m surprised the people buying the tech wouldn’t have one on the reviews I’ve read.As soon as you put the headset on you’re immersed in a VR world. I was sceptical about the graphics but how wrong could I have been.From fighting a fully sized IVAN DRAGO on creed, holding a light Sabre fighting Darth Vader to free climbing up mountains this system has it all.If you want something a little more relaxing, you can put on Amazon or Netflix and you’re in the third row of a cinema - SIMPLY incredible.One of the best things I’ve ever purchased and for 400 an absolute steel. When you compare the cost of games that are free up to £28 with the majority being in the £7-20 bracket. Why wouldn’t you buy one! PS5 games are £70. BONKERS.

What can I say. Oculus 2. So impressed. I also have Oculus 1. Each of them fantastic. Oculus 2 is obviously lighter and graphics much clearer. Expanding elasticated headstraps a bonus a Oculus 1 had hard plastic straps. Elasticated straps easier and lighter. I find the new layout on the game paddles better. Unlike PS 4 which I also have I'm not restricted in movement. Can even play in the back garden. Gameplay is smooth. Selection of games good and expanding rapidly. One thing a little on the negative. I note the games are getting pricier. Hope this isn't going to be a common trend as Sony games on PS4. Well over priced. One of the reasons I bought it was the price of games. I'll keep an eye out.  A watch out for glass wearers. Oculus 2 seems a little tighter across the head set. Tends to pull glasses off on removal. Oculus 1 was fine. The other Oculus 1 cost me £600 whereas Oculus 2 cost £300. This did annoy me somewhat especially when you get more features with Oculus 2 at half the price. We live and learn. Overall though O2 is brilliant for gaming. Chilling in your virtual room in front of a massive screen and huge fire or watch Netflx. Whatever you do. You'll love it. I just hope the games dont spiral out of cost range. Keep it reasonable Oculus.

The only other VR system I have ever owned is the Oculus Quest 1 so this review is based on the comparison between the two.The first thing that I immediately noticed when trying the headset for the first time, was the quality of the image. It felt like looking the world through a tunnel and the edges were warped when moving my head. After about 15 minutes of using it, I felt dizziness, something that I never felt with the Quest 1. I think that is related to the lacking IPD settings on the device. My IPD is 71mm, but the maximum that the Quest 2 supports is 68mm. I also suspect that the one single display contributes to the warping and weirdness that I observed.On the other hand, the image quality itself is a lot better compared to Quest 1 and the new graphical capabilities are clearly visible and appreciated.While the Quest 2 is clearly a worse fit for me than the Quest 1 is, some of my friends, who have an IPD that matches one of the 3 available settings on the device, say that the experience is really good for them.

Can see its a step up from the original as per the hype. Graphics have improved, albeit if you're playing older games they're still the same. Playing newer games such as Walking dead and you start to see potential and Population One looks even better.I find this more comfortable and stable on my head, though can see for some users it would start to rub the forehead. Sounds is good quality.Can see Oculus/Facebook are investing more on this and have lots of developmental features inbound so well worth the investment.

Quest 2 is amazing and it will give you the best experience in VR. Having a VR that is powerful and portability is so amazing. The only criticism is if you play Quest 2 for a long period of time you will feel uncomfortable on you facial area because you are carrying the weight on ur face especially in nasal area. You wont get this feeling in Rift S but the only hassle is the cord dangling around ur back but it will never give you pain or uncomfortable in a long periods of time.

Oculus have made a huge jump here.With the price being so low you'd think that it wasn't very good... But it is quite the oppositeUsing the headset on standalone, it is able to run games extremely well. And there have been a few updates to increase the refresh rate of each eye panel to 90Hz which makes the experience much more smooth and immersive.I bought a £15 cable to plug it into my PC which allows me to play Steam VR games at better quality, so its great that Oculus give you that option.Nevertheless, for the price, this ticks all of the boxes and more for an entry level VR headset.

In all my years of using VR, from Vive to Index to Quest 2... I must say that I have not owned a better value VR device than this.This little thing is fully capable of replacing any tethered PC VR headset, including the Valve Index. It has better displays, better lenses, is fully wireless and standalone. You can stream games from your PC to the Quest 2 over Wi-Fi. It's SO affordable. This purchase should be a no-brainer.The only downside is that this is made by Meta (Facebook). They notoriously collect a lot of data, and force you to log in using your Facebook social media account. I would not recommend buying many games on the Quest 2 store, because you may find that you become locked into the Meta (Facebook) eco-system later down the road.

Not the real improvement over the quest, I was hoping for. Comparing the two, there is only one improvement, the image is slightly sharper, but the original is better in every other way.  The quality and design, comes no where close to the original. As someone else has mentioned, it uses a cheaper led screen rather than the oled, as in the original, which does kill the experience. It is also very uncomfortable, I could wear the original for at least a couple of hours, I could not manage more than 20 minutes with this, as the weight of the screen pulls on the face, which becomes very uncomfortable.

I bought the product at a very small discount from Amazon warehouse. Really wish I hadn't. Batteries and silicon visor missing from box which wiped out discount and customer services terrible for anything more sophisticated than a straight return. Irritating.

It works with full body, you can get a different program if you don’t like air link.The battery only lasts around 2 hours which is a bit painful but i just lay down and let it charge if I’m alone.Quality can be really bad and pixelated if your pc isn’t great and your wifi has to be good.It’s a very good cheap vr option though i don’t regret buying it.

Cost of games is usually costly but no different than that of a console, so bear this in mind when purchasing.I went for the 256GB version and glad I did as memory gets used up quicker than expected.Using a link cable increases the variety of gaming (suggest getting a Steam account for this) but to sum up, the Oculus quest II is a sound fun and engaging investment for all the family.

This is definitely a good headset, it has a great display, great controllers, great games, and great tracking.My suggestion would be though to get a third party strap as the stock strap is slighty uncomfortable, also due to the low battery I reccomend getting a power bank and a power bank strap.Though if you are new to vr my suggestion would be to play beatsaber as it is a simple concept and a game anymore can play and understand how you play.Overall this headset is a must buy but if your here for long play sessions I recommend getting a third party head strap and a power bank, so it might cost you more money than just buying a standard Quest 2.

No matter what I did, how long I charged it, what ever plug I used; the thing would not charge.I contacted oculus. They couldn't do anything so they asked me to send it to them to investigate and they would send me a replacement.My review is based on the fact it simply did not work and was faulty.

Forget all the negative stuff about Facebook, yes it would be preferable if it wasn't mandatory, but people don't moan about having to use apple or Google for their phones.Wireless vr is a real game changer, I have used vr for the past 4 years and this is by far the best headset I have owned.The resolution is great and almost eliminates the screen door effect (the space you can see inbetween the pixels ) meaning a really crisp image. The headstrap is a bit naff but cheap enough to buy a replacement.At this price it's a great way to get into vr as there are tonnes of amazing titles to play now and it's also a great way to watch movies.

Let us be honest, it’s a hype that frankly for £299 I was reluctant but being a dad I was proven wrong. Again.It’s well made and the kids love it, much better than us parents would remember the wii VR thing.Still I think pricey for what you get though compared to a PS4 or Xbox for what they can do. Games, tv, online media, dvd, blu ray. Would think if Oculus want the market place they’d have an added box that steals the market from Sony and Nintendo. 🙄

I was really excited about this.  It does work very good for some people.  The potential for it to be fantastic is high but the design is flawed. My disappointment is that for some people it does not have the adjustment required to allow a good clear picture.  3 fixed IPD settings is a very poor design.  68mm is also too small for some people.  I returned it because nothing I could do would allow me to get a clear picture with no eye strain.  Field of view was also very narrow.  My experience with a head tracker and a large monitor was better for sims.

Just one Fatal Flaw ... any one with an android tablet will appreciate this, usb port getting damaged when connecting power cable unplugging/plugging. The exact same thing happens when tethering to your PC a cable to a headset and you start moving around. Will assume lots of headsets will be returned - needs a bit of a re-think. I'm using a picture velcro strip to hold the cable neatly to the headset.  Wireless is the way to go if you can. Great fun! And would recommend one.

I have been using the Oculus almost Daily since purchase. Things that I would suggest buying for using the oculus comfortably.Micro fibre Cloths, just any should do, if your forehead or fingers touch the lenses it instantly needs a wipeSilicon cover, either replace the stock foam or get a silicon cover so that you can wipe sweat off, I used the stock foam for a while but it can’t come off the plastic for washing.I think very much worth it, I use it to watch Netflix now because the picture is very good

Quality is similar to other VR I’ve tried in the past few years. Main selling point is you download games etc into to device and then it’s all self contained; no wires.So you can use it where you want.There is an extra mounting head harness which makes wearing it more comfortable.

Great when it work, but comfortably the glitchiest piece of tech I’ve bought in 10+ years, particularly when tethered to a PC. If you don’t load multiple programs in the right order, or if you take off or put the headset down, you’re frequently in ‘reset everything’ territory. When it works its great, but far too many useability issues. Don’t buy with a view to tethering if you need a strictly plug-and-play device.

BEWARE: You need a facebook account to use this device, otherwise you'll just have a £400 doorstop (and probably not a very good one at that). I decided to buy this headset after looking at various online reviews, but I have never had a facebook account. So, I thought I'd make one before buying - good thing too. I went onto facebook, entered my information, clicked on the button to create the account and immediately got a message saying my account was blocked!After some googling, it appears that this happens sometimes and there is no sensible way of resolving it (certainly you'll never be able to get through to a human). Even if I could resolve it now, I'd be too worried about this happening in the future, rendering my headset useless. So I guess they won't be getting my money after all. Shame as it seems an ideal headset to use for getting into VR.

Product arrived promptly, but after that it all went from bad to terrible.The headset would not show any sign of life.  Thinking this might be something simple, I contacted Oculus support- a *really* bad decision.They asked for me to try a couple of easy things, and for some reasonable bits of information, serial number, invoice number etc.  After that it just got stupid - they wanted a video to prove that the charging light did not come on.  But their system would not accept mp4 video, so I had to ùse YouTube ( for the first time) and post them a link.  Then, in addition to the serial number from the box, they wanted a serial number from the headset, but I couldn't find it.  Could they send me a picture showing where this number is? ""No, it's too hard to find(!), take the batteries out of the controller and send that number  instead"".  ""No, not those numbers, the ones in very small print hidden in the corner"".  Could they have a photo of the Amazon invoice?  ""No, sending all the information on it is not enough, it has to be a picture"".  This went on for an hour and a half, now the customer support guy is applying for approval before acknowledging that something needs to be done.  For a complex problem developing in use this might ( just about) be acceptable, but for a machine which had never shown any sign of being anything other than an empty plastic case it is totally unreasonable.

I’d been excited to receive this since it was first announced and was keen to get it set up when it arrived. My first impression was that the screen was very blurry but I thought that I’d be able to rectify it by playing around with the fit and IPD settings. Once I got to the home screen, it looked absolutely horrendous. There was a tiny sweet spot and everything else was very blurred. If I moved my head very slightly, everything just got more blurry and distorted. The text was difficult to read and had a horrible halo effect around it and the God Rays were awful. There was also a significant amount of chromatic aberration and colour distortion. Playing Beat Saber was bearable as it doesn’t require you to move your head or look around but anything else caused significant eye strain and gave me a headache and just felt generally uncomfortable on my eyes. It didn’t make any difference whether I wore my glasses or my prescription lense inserts. I know from looking online that this is not an isolated issue so I  returned my device for a refund and have gone back to my original Quest for the time being. I sincerely hope that Oculus can sort these issues out so that I can repurchase a Quest 2 in the future.

After 2 Months of play, the Oculus Quest 2 is great fun but after the initial hype, the novelty is wearing off.If you’re happy with short casual mini games and experiences this is for you but, If you want in depth gaming, there’s very little to be found.This is an honest review for the casual user.The Good• The headset and controllers are light and robust with a comfortable fit.• It is fully immersive and great fun• Wireless gives you freedom• The tracking (follows your hands and head movement) is surprisingly accurate when it works.• The games store has sales all the time• Built in speakers are pretty good directing the sound to you and not the whole room• Guardian Area (you can limit the space you play in so you don’t bump into things) works well.• Watching YouTube via the Quest is quite novel.Could be improved• Graphics are low quality, blurry at a distance and no better than a mobile phone game• Screen glare and lack of true black can be distracting.• Battery life is OK but you will find yourself charging it more than using it• External cameras (you can switch from VR to look around your room) are very low quality.• You can glitch and randomly lose Tracking and your Guardian Area which is annoying.• Some games will cause nausea when moving.• Very few in depth games with longevityIt is great fun and novel, and for the price (£299 at time of writing), I expected the hardware and therefor the games to be limited.What really lets it down is the lack of games that will keep you coming back to play.It is fun, but the novelty will wear off.To start I recommend any of the following gamesBeat SaberWalkabout Mini GolfForeVR BowlThe Walking Dead: Saints & SinnersThe Room VR: A Dark MatterEleven Table Tennis

I absolutely love this. I'm one of the people that doesn't use Facebook but I also don't care if Facebook wants my data (I'm a pretty boring person.)Word of warning; be ready to splash out another £100 or so.Get a good quality battery pack with fast charging 10,000 or more  MAH or be prepared to charge this more than you use it, a strap for said battery, A 0.3m/ 0.5m fast charging usbC cable, a new headstrap ( I have a BOBAVR M2) and a new face plate ( I bought a good quality PU one from VRcover.com and it's amazing.)As stock the unit is functional, watch some videos on YouTube to see how to use your thumb to adjust the IPD to suit your eyes as the 3 IPD settings the Q2 has didn't do it for me but this trick worked a wonder.The stock faceplate has no way to stop light from coming in at your nose area so unless you are of pure Roman heritage you will need a replacement faceplate for better immersion.The original headstrap, while functional does get a little uncomfortable after a while. The battery lasts about 2-3 hours so as I mentioned.. Get a power bank and attach it to the back off the strap. If you really need to play PCVR games, buy a good quality CAT8 cable and a wifi6 modem to connect wirelessly and buy the virtual desktop app from the Oculus store. I have a LINKSYS MR7350 and this does the job well.

I used Quest 1 64GB  for a year and then moved to Quest2 256 GB. I found it to be a cost cutting exercise. I am using Oculus VR for movie watching on Prime and other platforms and rarely for games.- horizontal headband is made from elastic tape and pulls your hair (Q1 had velcro)- optics is much worse and I don't see clearly outside of the centre of the picture, looking away makes for a blurry/doubled image- black are light gray - when watching movies it looks like watching through a thick grey fog, even sideloading Android settings app to lower the brightness does not help, this one is absolutely disgusting- controllers are too thick and I cannot grab them comfortably (Q1 was perfect).Pros (although irrelevant in the context of the above listed cons):- more memory- more powerful processor- apparently more resolution, but you cannot see it anyway.[2021/11] UpdateI haven't used it for half a year, just cannot force myself to do it. Disgusting.I even ignored recall action for a headband and upgrading my developer account. This is how much I despise this thing.

I am over 70 and so are most of my friends and some of my family. In common with a significant number of people of our generation, we do not want to have a Facebook account, we do not need one. Like a great number of other crumblies, we enjoy new technology and love to try new gadgets but, having missed out on earlier Oculus sets we now find we are effectively barred from ever owning a VRH.I hope this will not become the norm as I would hate to have to reveal my BMI and bra size when the Ninja needs replacing. What possible justification is there for involving Facebook? Increased profits do not count as a valid reason as customer service should come first. Also literally thousands of sales will be lost if the reactions of other Amazon customers is anything to go by.

The Oculus device hardware is impressive but better hope you don't need any tech support.  Having encountered a Facebook related account issue, 6 months on I have yet to see any progress in resolving the matter.  Oculus tech support is responsive but very slow, once the issue was passed to Facebook however, tech support is hopeless.  It's as though they simply don't care - totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable.  My Oculus device plus paid for games have been rendered totally useless.  Be warned and be aware of the risk.

A few more pixels and this is lifelike.  Honestly a massive improvement on last gen - only recieved today but very impressed.The recognition of surrounding s is bloody amazing and the controllers are impressive including how they are seen by the head set.  for me the main issues are that there is no nose cushion supplied and no diopter adjuster out of the box - you have to physically space your head.Thats the bad, the good is that it is immersive, light, excellent out of the box sound quality and easy to set up - be aware you need a Mobile phone to set up fully or a device it can connect to the app on at least - only niggle here is the awkwardness of the oculus software but im sure i will figure that out.Absolutely adore this and if you are getting one, dont skimp, get the 256gb version :-)

Who said I can't get out the house, even if it is in VR.No PC required just a smartphone and WiFi!This is the Oculus Quest 2 total wireless VR set available in both 64 or 256gb, the price difference is £100. In all honesty I'd go for the extra memory, but if you can't stretch to that, don't worry, you can keep installing games, apps etc when needed. Plus how many games do you really need?Unboxing is a delight, it reeks top end...you get one headset, 2 hand controllers, glasses spacer and a charger USB C to C for the headset with UK plug. The hand controllers take a AA battery each.Set up you will need to download the Oculus App from Play Store for Android or App Store for iOS, then register your details. You WILL need a valid Facebook account to link with the Quest 2, which some people have an issue with but yet they probably have personal assistant devices and a smartphone. During the set up you will need to power up your headset to link, there should be enough power. But once registered via onscreen code put it on charge for a couple of hours.Once charged turn your headset on, remove the black tabs from the hand controllers, now you are good to go. You will be at the dash, you can customise your avatar, get apps, watch videos or games.There are demos available for most games, so you can dip your toes in before buying, I fully recommend the usual apps like YouTube VR, Netflix and Amazon. Also one of the first things watch the Yukon Roller-coaster or the Everest video, mind blown. Ensure you are safely seated, as they are very real! Games like Beat Saber, Star Wars and The Climb are popular for a reason, you'll soon see why.Using the headset is ace, it can feel a little strange and intense to start but you'll get used to it. There is a volume control front right to adjust. The hand controllers are great, you have 2 trigger buttons, A and B buttons, thumbstick and a centering button when you lose your way! They are so light, and ensure you use the wrist wraps or you might lose one and smash something.One hour will turn into two and two into three when you are in the world of VR, so I warn you! Also it is a fantastic way to workout without realising it! Winner winner.Overall I thoroughly recommend this bit of kit, as it is reasonably priced, accessible to most and the games are considerably cheaper than consoles, half the price. There are also lots of third party attachments to add, and it will only get better and better.

The underlying technology is good. There are two key problems that I had that have ruined the experience though: 1) I had to return it twice to get one that didn't have some kind of annoying issue, like loud buzzing or dead pixels in the centre of the screen. 2) The software is buggy, to the point of simple things that should work (like exiting a program) don't work. I am fed up with having to restart the headset until it ""decides"" to start working.When it works, its pretty good. I don't like the halo/glow that the foveated lenses cause, but its not a huge deal. Its pretty comfortable, although the strap sucks, I needed to buy a better one. This feels like a half finished product, it has good points but is let down badly by others. I would recommend to wait until the next gen comes out and see if that is any better.

I have to say that visually the Quest 2 has really taken me back as coming from a CV1 Rift, the Quests screens clarity with nearly no noticeable screen door effect was amazing to see for a portable headset.The tracking is great considering it just uses the headsets cameras and the option to go completely wire free is a game changer, so why only 3 stars? Simply, comfort (and a bit of Facebook requirement I'm not overly happy about).The Quest 2 for me personally required half the cost of the initial headset (£200) to turn it into something I could wear for anything longer than 30mins, which with my Masters in virtual reality starting soon is a must. I had (and I stress the word had) to get a better head strap, facial interface & foam replacement set and then still yet a counterweight for the back of the strap.I'm sure you could get away with cheaper options than I did, like getting the Elite strap (£50) etc., but whatever you do expect to spend a significant sum to enjoy it as you should.

For five minutes this felt like a great VR experience. Sadly, it then got stuck in an endless update/reset loop (search it, I’m not the only one). The manufacturer is aware of this issue and has a list of instructions on how to try and fix it. Perhaps some of them work, for some headsets. No such luck for me.  Several factory resets, syncing and un-syncing with the app, rebooted WiFi, etc etc. Nothing. Unusable. Returned for a refund.Huge disappointment.

My son has been badgering me for months for one of these, and I finally relented.  It wasn't just for him; I really wanted one too.  The graphics are great, and I've managed to become totally engrossed in several of the games.  I'm quite susceptible to motion sickness when playing video games, but it's never a problem with the Quest.Graphics are great, and the motion/position detection is amazing.  Everything behaves exactly as you imagine it should as you move around.  The 'guardian' system is really clever, (mostly) preventing you from crashing into furniture and even pets when they wander into the danger zone.There are really only a couple of drawbacks.  Firstly, the battery life.  It takes a couple of hours to charge and much less than that to run flat.  Bizarrely, it doesn't warn you of low power - it just dies - which does seem a little strange.  There are ways around this.  You can plug in a battery pack and have it in your pocket as you duck and dive around the room, and that buys you a much longer run-time.  The other thing that doesn't work so well is casting.  As we take it in turns to use the Quest 2, it's nice to cast what the player can see on the TV.  For some reason, this is very laggy and frequently drops without warning, which makes it fairly useless as a feature.My final issue with it is the same as may many other people.  I don't like the fact that this has be linked to my Facebook account.  I don't see why this is necessary?  I guess it could be nice if no one else used it, but I don't want my kids to access my Facebook profile or Messenger chats.  It strikes me that we can't be the only family of four with a single Quest 2, which makes me think either Facebook haven't thought very much about use cases, or more likely, in their clamoring greed to harvest every nugget of my personal data, that they don't care.

If you expect this to charge while connected to a usb-c port for PC gaming, think again.  It will not.  Mine did, and following software updates, it doesn’t anymore.  I have had both the actual Oculus and my official link cable replaced and it still doesn’t work.  Oculus customer support is dreadfully poor.  I would advise avoiding this product if you want to use it with a PC.

Being a techy, I had been considering purchasing an Oculus for a little while. I have a to spec PC, but I was getting bored of some of the games and more and more of my colleagues were entering the world of VR and saying great things.The first thing to consider. Rift S or Quest 2. Simply put, the Quest 2, does everything the Rift S does with the added bonus you can also use the Quest 1 apps and Quest 2 apps to boot. You can also use sidequest to widen the content too available also.The second thing to consider is 64gb or 256gb. I purchased the larger 256gb, largely because I heard the games are increasing in size. However, if I had known that I can download games to the PC and run wirelessly via virtual desktop or the cable, I might have not bothered with paying the extra £100 because there is a huge amount of content on Steam and the Oculus link app setup for the Rift S that is now cross platformed to the Quest 2. Another reason why the Q2 is the clear choice over the Rift S, which will now soon become extinct due to the multi platform content availability.My first experience into VR was incredibly exciting I have to say. It is so much more than a games machine. I spend more time browsing free content from developers than I do playing games. The learning content you can choose is just amazing. I have VR swam some of the most exotic oceans, looking at underwater life, the VR experience allows you to select an underwater species and you will receive a full rundown of what that creature is.I have also space walked around ISS, this was an amazing VR experience which really manages to grant the viewer a sense of reality of what a zero gravity environment is genuinely like.So onto the games.FPS games takes realism to a whole new level, where you can physically remove the mag from the gun and reload it and they are plenty of FPS games to get your teeth into. Also, if you don't like a particular game you can refund your money providing you have played the game for less the 2 hours. Some games are likely to give you motion sickness though.The workout games are also excellent, another major plus for the current lockdowns when we cant get to the gym. The headset has a calorie tracker on there for you too.You can also watch Sky, Netflix and Amazon Prime, on a virtual huge screen. One of my favourite VR pastimes though is Google Earth VR. This takes Google Earth to a different dimension as you can use yourself as the yellow man and drop yourself into the middle of New York City or just about anywhere you want. The graphics aren't always rendering to perfection, but the experience is just phenomenal.I could go on and on, there are just so many diverse experiences to try out, and I have only had my Oculus quest 2 a matter of weeks and I feel like I have barely scratched the surface, but if the lockdown is starting to feel like the walls are closing in on you, then open them out and put your head into the world of VR.Recommended.

I am short sited and need to wear my glasses all the time.If I am not wearing my glasses I can not see in to the headset.So I have to wear my reading glasses which means the head set squashes on to my glasses and presses on to my face.Due to this, the head set has to be tightly fitted on to my face, 20 minutes maximum before my face is in discomfort.A lot of messing around with being comfort and trying to see before I can get round to anything.Quality is amazing.You need facebook for connecting only, nothing actually goes on to your profile etc.A person in a wheelchair has been trying to use the head set, it's a bit hard to explain, they are classed as an object so what they see in to the head set is not on their eye level, as you can cast what your doing on to a device, you can clearly see the difficulty in it all.Over all quite frustrating.

I ordered the HP Reverb G2 to play Steam VR games a few months ago, but was tired of waiting and got the Quest 2 as well. The plan is to use it when playing with friends, or in another room, at games that are not as graphically demanding as Alyx or Flight and race sims.I had to buy it elsewhere as it was out of stock at Amazon due to high demand, as most electronic products nowadays.My expectations were mediocre, I thought even I would sell it, worse case.I didn't like to use a facebook account, but I do not use it for vry personal things and I am not obsessed with any social media, so I do not care. But beware you meed a facebook accountand it has to be legit, they do disable accounts if they find they are not legit (and you would lose also products you previously bought on that account... nice. The device won't brick though, it would just need to be reset to factory again)Ok, after this boring stuff.I got my headset and got a USB 3.0 type C to type A cable to use the Link function. Yes, it does not need to be type C to type C, it has to be USB 3.0 or 3.1, that is the super important bit (and the PC supporting such standard). Many cable type C to type C cables are 2.0... just be aware.Ihad time to play with it both stand alone and with steam VR, here are my PERSONAL conclusions.1) playing wirelessly using virtual desktop on steam VR is far than being like playing with the cable. It lags, microphone does not work... it is a NO for me. And I use a good Asus router with Merlin firmware and the PC is hardwired. The standard is just lower and unaccettable to me, at least as it is now2) the quality of the headset just blew my mind... it feels well manufactured, the display is amazing...coming from some experiences with older headsets, the samsung vr box and PSVR, this is MILES away. No side door effect, clear picture, very immersive (see picture taken with my phine camera throgh the lenses)3) the tracking is good. Windows mixed reality are very much affected by the room light and it needs to be adjusted carefully. This uses infrared, so unless you really go crazy with sunlight or strange lamps, it tracks perfectly every time. And had no problem with Alyx (throwing granades were always spot on), playig Beat Saber etc4) the head strap is awful. It works for a while, then gets uncomfortable. If you like the headset like I did, buy the original headstrap with wheel adjustment (the one in the photo), as it changes the comfort like night and day, and makes it easier also to use it with friends5) controllers feel nice. The trigger and side buttons do not feel very premium, but they work really well anyway6) with the latest update of firmware (23) the Link PC connection supports 90Hz refresh rate and very high quality, it does make a huge difference and it is enjoyable7) oculus software on PC allows to use the PC desktop and you can create separe accessible wimdows while you play you VR game (I use it if I am waiting messages on whatsapp so I can check it, or for discord)8) battery on the headset doesn't last very long when used stand alone, but the controllers battery is really good, it seems to last forever, considering they are basically joypads...Conclusion.I am definitely going to keep the headset. I will use it stand alone once I get the reverb G2 as it is worth it. For people going to buy it as main only headset, it is going to be perfect and will be a brilliant value, with superb visualsEDIT: for some reasons (maybe updates on Virtual Desktop?) playing wirelessly works perfect now! No stuttering at all, like zero! In fact I use it all the time now, playing wirelessly is amazing

I came from an original HTC Vive which was starting to show its age, mainly due to the limited pixel count and the relatively severe screen door effect which is most obvious in Flight Sim 202”. The Quest 2 has a significantly improved resolution however its biggest downfall is the LCD panel. Colours via Link appear washed out and flat. Unfortunately this means that nearly all elements are of the same brightness, regardless of whether you’re looking at the sun or the ground.In all other areas, such as local on-device play, the quest 2 is an extremely convenient, portable and capable headset. However, if you’re going to be playing PC games, such as Flight Simulator 2020 an OLED panel is essential, such as the Vive Pro.

A great product, if you're looking to get into VR but don't want to spend a fortune, it's a very sleek and clean looking product and the clarity and graphics are amazing for the price, some games utilise it's capabilities more than others (I recommend GORN) it's an amazing piece of kit, and comes with everything you need to start playing at home or on the go.For those who are thinking about getting this product and are weighing out the pros and cons between this and some other vr device, I'd recommend to get this one unless you have unlimited reserves of money. This headset comes jam packed with everything you need and is constantly recieving updates. There isn't a huge library of games (natively) but through any usb C cable to whatever port your PC uses you now have access to steams entire library and any VR game you can find online by just downloading steam vr and the oculus desktop app.The only cons in my opinion are that I ended up spending a fair amount of additional money upgrading it. After some research I found reviews suggesting the head strap isn't the best out there so I ended up buying Oculus' elite headstrap, which now having used both straps is well worth the extra money. I also purchased a new facial interface (the bit that separates the headset from your face and provides padding to make it comfy) the default one is made of some type of foam, which in my opinion is fairly comfortable (for some it irritates their skin) but I replaced this because any sweat that comes out of your forehead is going to get soaked up into that foam making it wet and uncomfortable, you can get silicone covers to place over this foam but that means there's absolutely no absorption so the sweat drips down your face, so for a happy medium I recommend buying a PU leather face cover, the sweat clings to this but can also be wiped off easily, it also tends to feel more comfy than foam or silicone.I didn't need to spend any of this extra money but chose to for my own comfort so I'm keeping the rating at a 5/5!

When lockdown kicked in March 2020 I decided to buy an Oculus Go headset.I'd experienced a VR headset in our local library when they did a Doctor Who BBC VR event and I'd loved that. But it wasn't until we all locked down that it occurred to me that VR would be a good way to combat the 'stir crazy' that being confined long term might cause.Turned out it was a wise purchase and made a huge difference to my sense of well being.But then the news came that the Oculus Go was being discontinued...I spent some time feeling disappointed and then bought an Oculus Quest 2 and wow!!!Even more incredible than the Go.I use VR to exercise indoors while feeling as if i am outdoors.  I go on exercise cycle rides, walks - so much and it had literally widened my horizons.Now i have bought one of these for my son who lives hundreds of miles away so we can meet in VR and spend time together sharing experiences together.  Alcove VR is a particular favourite of mine and has a virtual living room where you can meet up with your family and watch movies and play games together.It is all a bit Ready Player One but I always was one of the folk who would have stayed inside the Matrix.

I've been using the original Oculus Rift CV1 that was released in 2016 and it was by far the best piece of tech I had ever invested in—until Oculus Quest 2!I was blown away by how much of an improvement there is to the screen. Screen door effect (where you can see the individual pixels) is effectively gone. The image clarity is astounding. While the panel is an LCD, so you don't get those deeper blacks, this is a trade off I am happy with. Everything is sharp, clear and text is easy to read now.Wireless VR is also amazing! I've used VR by connecting to my PC for so long, I do sometimes forget the freedom I have with this headset now. The headset boots up within seconds and you're already in VR.  It really couldn't be any easier with this device. The friction to getting into VR has been reduced considerably. The tracking is also fantastic and I love that I don't need to put up sensors anymore. The hand tracking is also a really cool feature that you have access to, but it's still in its early stages.Audio is decent and convenient to have on the headset itself, but I would it's worth investing in a good pair of headphones for more immersion.Overall, the device runs very smoothly, no crashes as of yet. I honestly can't believe how good this headset is for its price!! It's incredible how far VR has come in the past 4 years.The only downside to this headset is that it's slightly heavier than my original Rift, but comfort was helped greatly by using the Elite strap that you can also buy. After about 2-3 hours, it does start to get a bit uncomfortable... but that's plenty of time in VR! :)Oh, and one last thing: you can connect this VR headset to your PC by using Oculus Link and it works great!! Even with some compression, the image is far better than the original Oculus Rift!  Oculus are also updating link as it's still in beta run now. And streaming from Virtual Desktop to play wireless PCVR is also amazing!!I highly recommend this headset to people who've never tried VR and even those who've been waiting since the early days of VR for an upgrade. You will not regret it.VR has been steadily growing over the past few years. But it's about to really take off!

I have wanted to try VR for some time but couldn't justify the cost.Thanks to lockdown I had some spare cash, so while my son was trying to get a PS5, the Quest 2 for me was a no brainer! And I'm not disappointed.I may have spoiled things a little for my son however as he at last managed to find his console and then I showed him Skyrim VR running in the Q2 :) We may speak again some day...Positives: Easy to set up (slightly more involved for PCVR). reasonably comfortable, good handsets and tracking.Negatives: You WILL spend more on extras! I soon discovered I need a new glasses prescription and although you can wear glasses under the headset I will be getting lens holders to fit inside (so more cost). There is plenty to play in the Q2 or via PC but it may be a while before we see AAA titles pushing the envelope. But the biggest downside at the moment is probably if you mainly want PCVR - the headset cannot be properly charged by the Link cable during play, so you will get more than the usual 2 hour battery life but not mega sessions.Last words: Nothing you see on YouTube will prepare you for the experience of being INSIDE a game! There may be a couple of better VR headsets, but not at this price point. If you can afford it, buy it.

I agree with all the hype written about this headset, and share the disgruntlement of having to set up a Facebook account.  However, the main issue I have is that my son, for whom this was a Christmas present, has been unable to use it because he suffered a severe allergic reaction to the material from which the headset is made. This fault in the manufacturing process is well known to Oculus/Facebook as there is a notice about a possible skin reaction on their website.  Oculus has promised me a replacement ""facial interface"" but this has yet to arrive and the headset has been an expensive ornament for more than 3 weeks now.10 days later (26th Jan) - still no sign of the replacement facial interface.  Have purchased an inexpensive silicone face cover from Eyglo which covers the foam. My son no longer experiences any skin reaction and the headset is now in constant use.  Oculus loses an additional star...

The technology is so close to being unbelievable but there are a few downsides:1: Motion sickness is bad. It takes me two hours to recover from 20 minutes of game play.2: Picture quality is poor. Far too much blur. There is a tiny sweet spot to get clarity which is unrealistic in game as you’ll need to look around. Yes I’ve change the lenses widths multiple time.3: There’s not really much free stuff.

Didn’t buy from Amazon as out of stock at the time, bought 128gb model for my daughter’s 15th birthday, also bought the elite headset and battery pack, would have bought the link cable if we didn’t have decent Wi-Fi and full-size  fibre, pretty much a must buy, which makes it £418.00 and overall still happy with the price for what your getting.Waited until wireless link was enabled and full fibre arrived at our home.Setup was pretty easy, with my daughter’s mid range PC 2070 Super, Ethernet and dedicated our 5ghz Wi-Fi to the headset and have to say it’s a very impressive and immersive experience.The Facebook thing is obviously a choice, if you don’t like it don’t buy, but didn’t put us of as there is nothing else on the market at this price to performance.Pretty steep learning curve getting to grips with a new UI and experience, but will give hours of fun, happy with our purchase, hope this review helps.

Facebook essentially own this hardware and will force you to become a member of their data harvesting program before you are able to take full advantage of the headset. That coupled with an ever-growing list rules that force you to forgo more of your personal data over time, and this results in being nothing more than a device that you plonk onto your cranium to distract you from unwittingly handing your biometric and personal data over to one of, if not, THE most deceitful organisation (not company, much bigger) on the planet.

Like others, I disapprove of having to tie my FB account to the Quest, but I decided to live with it. There is a side effect of this policy though, which is very nearly a show stopper for me.If you have multiple people wanting to play the same game (in turns), there is NO native support for this; they either all have to use the same save file (which for progressive games ia a non starter), or have their individual FB accounts, and completely wipe and re-install the headset every time you want to switch users. Imagine you have a family with 4 people all wanting to share the headset without overwriting each others game saves - this can't be done on the Quest 2.FB have been promising for months to have multiple save slots, but have so far not come up with anything but a promise. A few games do allow multple saves, but it is not ubiquitous.Shame, as otherwise the hardware seems really good, but I'd have to say avoid this until FB have got their act together.

Incredible! The games are amazing, the experiences are so immersive it feels like you are actually there. Altspacevr is an entire world with events that you can enjoy with other people from around the world. I got the head strap accessory and it's so much more comfortable. I don't play games at all but since getting the quest, it's changed lockdown for me entirely! Anything you could want to experience,there's something for you on quest 2

The device itself is good, controllers are great, same as always. Tracking is good too, not perfect but good enough. Games are decent although there isn't a massive choice. It can be used with a pc to extend the library. The device connects to Facebook, which is required. So be warned. Doesn't bother me, I don't use Facebook. All in all, really good for £300. Got other VR headsets too. They're better for wired PC gaming.

Lots of reviews focus on the fact that you need a Facebook account to use this.It would be a real shame if people were out off by that, especially given that most people probably have a FB account anyway. The tech available here is really staggering. If you aren’t familiar with VR, you will be amazed at how far the technology has come - and all for under £300.I’ve had mine for six months and every day I’m still finding stuff to be blown away by.

It gets so competitive and so real and its so immersive that you lose yourself in it.I've bought this also for Sim racing which is basically sitting in a car and driving. What a fantastic device for the money. Best £300 I've ever spent. And it's not just gaming too. Very educational as you can learn about the human body in details. It's an unbelievable little thing.

My new Oculus Quest 2 turns itself off after a few minutes whilst in the middle of a game and needs to be restarted from scratch losing all game progress.  I have been in contact with the help desk who seem pretty hapless asking the same questions again and again.  All i want is a replacement product or even  a refund.  I am very disappointed .UPDATE:  Facebook have just agreed to replace my Oculus with a replacement.  Sending original to Prague and await response.  Upping review to 3 star as help desk eventually helped but first oculus was rubbish.2nd UPDATE: Replacement Oculus received after just 6 days. Amazing.  No problems with it so far.  So if you have any problems, keep on pressing  the Help Centre for a replacement.  Worked for me.Impressive VR.

The processing power of this unit as a complete standalone is great, especially as it is completely wireless.A lot of the popular games are so for a reason, including the likes of beat saber and the walking dead.Linked up to a decent gaming PC using a link cable (no need to buy the official oculus one) also unlocks the capability of Steam VR which is on a whole other level.

Okay first off, is it worth the money? YES, Definitely! Buy one now, if you haven't already!! Bought for my son for Christmas I set it up the evening before so it was ready to go on the Big day! Surprisingly I couldn't find the USB-C charging port on the headset at the start because a thin piece of shipping paper was covering it, once off charging was a breeze although I thing the cable could be a bit longer, a mere 0.5m! 2.5hrs for a full charge with colour LED on side between stages, red = dead, amber = 50%, to green. Comes with 50% charge or just below, enough to set it up and gaze in wonder at what the heck you are looking at! Believe me this is far more than entertainment for kids, this is a completely different world! Even if you fall off something your body feels it, I think this is because in our brains we know what it feels like in real life so in VR it is the same because visually you are falling!! Scary as hell tbh but the best thing is  you don't break your legs or anything!! And anyway I just shut my eyes!! At one section of a space port I didn't/dare walk off the edge with a drop of about 40 feet because my brain said I shouldn't be so stupid! So I didn't!! This is a very clever bit of tech, and there are about 30 free games to get u going at the start without paying for anything. But you will need a Facebook account and the app on your phone to start. Once that bit's done you can use it solo, it doesn't depend on wi-fi or the phone, only when you want to buy a new game or world. Graphics are excellent, better than 3D if that is possible, you can actually bend and turn your head to look under and around things like in real life, duck down if things come flying at you!! The Gaurdian Zone is really very effective at stopping you from launching yourself into stationary objects in the room, very clever safety system. Blue shows the barrier, red that you're going to hit something. Only height is an issue if you have a typical living room lamp that hangs from ceiling, I'm going to change ours to a flush mount ceiling one as we have impacted the light at least 3 times so far!Warning instructions very good and spot on to take it easy oldies/parents especially, few mins at a time to get your bearings and avoid falling over by losing your balance. I think kids are better at it as some have VR in schools, I know our lad does, so despite our warnings and adhering to them, he cottoned onto it very well. As the unit depletes battery in about 3hrs and takes 2.5hrs to charge again, it at least allows a natural break for recovery from any eye strain or slight dizzyness. The inside of the headset gets warm and a light film appears on the lenses at times, use a microfibre cloth to clean the surfaces every once in a while keeps the image clear or it may appear fuzzy. The headset is very adaptable to the head, doesn't move around, a good fit and not uncomfortable. The handsets are also very easy to use once you figure out which is left and right!! I was dubious at first buying such an expensive unit but I can see the whole family enjoying this as although it is wi-fi I believe you can get a cable and even connect it to a PC. Not tried that yet. When my wife first put the headset on in the trial area she screamed in disbelief! It is incredible how a piece of technology can generate such a real life environment! Fabulous product!

I tried original Oculus Rift years ago and this is so much better..so much fun, there are so many applications! Not only gaming but VR experiences, VR YouTube channel, educational demos, watching Netflix on a massive screen and hanging out with your friends in VR space (especially now that we can't travel that's amazing). I love this thing! Just remember about 20/20/20 rule - every 20 minutes taje 20 second break and look 20m away. Otherwise you may get blurry vision/ dry eyes. Also the middle of the lens must be perfectly aligned with your pupils, otherwise you may get blurry vision (need to measure distance between your pupils with a ruler and adjust the lenses accordingly, very easy to do!)But once you have this sorted this things is awesome, absolutely love it!

True story, I don't have a console or actually a TV. Trouble is I'm a busy guy and don't have time to upload games, watch as they update.Why the Oculus Q2. I heard it was fun and there is a lot of free fun content. There is..I can watch Netflix, Prime VR in a cinema, or do some work in a nice setting, I can browse the web, do my emails, watch TV, Everything from a mobile or laptop but in a VR beautiful setting.I did download a Star Wars game and it's Brilliant fun. There is a lot of free software that you can immerse yourself into. Solid purchase.I had to replaced the head strap and also had halo protectors added from Kiwi.I use this Headset most days. I wish I had a bigger space so I could walk around my virtual home.Only problem is when you take it off, you remember it's raining and you want to go back to your beautiful sunny home.I don't have Facebook so created an empty shell profile.

I got the 256gb version. The Quest 2 in terms of performance has more than met my expectatons! I It's fast and has good resoolution, and interface works well, no lag, or crash, easy to install apps, buy apps from the oculus store, a dream to use, BUT there is a flaw with the Q2,  which is that it is designed for people with small faces, teens and kids.Oculus expects buyers to go n the hunt for replacement face guards so as to stop light leakage which spoils the experience. However, the face guards are so varied that likely its going to be hit or miss that you get one that works for you.Comparare that to the ageing samsung gear that cost about £60 which had NO issues with light leakage.  The Q2 is badly designed in terms of who can use it.  And I a, not going to waste money buying lots of replacement foam braces fore it, so my current solutiion is to stick small pieces of a sponge into the gaps on either side of my nose, that I will contnue to perfect.Therefore an excellant product is let down by piir design in terms of the fit of the headset on adult faces.

Utterly fab, escapist gaming experience. I can't add much that hasn't been said before, but rather just echo how impressive the unit is. I'd had a shot at a previous, cabled pre-Oculus headset about 18 months before purchasing this, and the difference is huge. The graphics are sharp and the immersive experience is incredible. It does take a bit of fiddling with the strap to get the fit just right, but once you hit the sweet spot you can get completely lost in thevirtual world.A full charge lasts me about an hour of gaming, which isn't particularly long, but to be expected with such a powerful mobile unit. And besides, it acts a kind of natural limiter to stop me living my entire life in the thing.Totally sold on it - spending far too much on games, but loving every minute. Totally recommended!

Warning though the head strap that comes with it becomes uncomfortable after a short time. Oculus sell an upgraded one with additional battery life, which we got on offer for £79. Don’t know why this head strap doesn’t come as standard, but then they wouldn’t make as much money. Games can be purchased via the app that are then easily download straight to the headset. Make sure you set boundaries within the settings otherwise you may end up with some broken ornaments.

This was a expensive Christmas present for the kids but they have loved it, the games are a tad expensive when you buy them but they are very good qualityThe head band is not amazing and the other admins on the market seem to be worth gettingThe batterie lasts for ages without charging so shouldn’t effect game playMy son developed a burn/rash on face after using, done some research and this is a genuine issue have raised with oculus and sending another face mild that should reduce this. My son wasn’t in any pain or discomfort with the rash/burn but was noticeble

Our family love the Oculus! Bought for our teen son for Christmas. However the Oculus has something for the entire family. Even me, a full time wheelchair user. Love the free roller coaster app, love using the map explore app and seeing different countries and cities ( just like you were actually there). My husband loves the warplanes. There is so much to chose from.Only negative is we bought the 256 Oculus and was sent the 128. Didn't realise till after Christmas. Called Amazon and they sorted it out very quickly. Just check which one they send you to make sure it is the one you ordered.

Bought as a Xmas present and my son loves it only downfall is battrey doesnt seem to last that long but cant get a battrey pack anywhere feels like it lasts 2 hours and thats pushing it but he loves it, I was also got the head strap to tighten on his head but returned it as he didn't need it the oculus quest done a good job on its own so no need to buy head a plastic head strap for £50 odd pound the oculus does well and adjusts so any size head would of gave 5 stars if battrey lasted........

I had never experienced any kind of VR before and was very excited for my Quest 2, it came in very nice packaging though the Quest itself had small dust on it? From research before purchase I was expecting it to have incredibly bad battery life though I believe that was an exaggeration because it lasts more than a few hours before getting low battery, the feel of it is very futuristic and it isnt uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time even whilst wearing glasses underneath, has an adjustable strap on both the headset and a strap to ensure you dont drop the hand pieces

Overall the device was good quality, but the link to a single Facebook is a big limiting factor in a family household.On top of that the device made my daughters very queasy, and no matter what we did to the settings, they fel quite unwell after only 3 - 5 minutes of use.All in all a reasonable deice, but still needs more development (and not linked to Facebook /with support for multiple accounts) so not suitable for our use case.

The Head strap is an atrocious design, The Oculus Go head strap is way better than this, this one  slips down your face even when sitting still. And if you wear glasses be very aware, if they are 140 mm wide or more you can not get them in the headset without bending, and when you finally get them in when you remove the headset , they stay very jammed in there and hit the lenses. and the glasses spacer falls of at the slightest touch. , Great Visuals in the Quest 2 , but way to many basic problems to use for a fun session, mine just sits on the side now until, I can afford another few hundred pounds to fix these very blatent design flaws.

Was mich am allermeisten aufregt ist, dass man die Schärfe nur in 3 verschiedenen Stärken auswählen kann, anstatt stufenlos.Wenn das Bild also immernoch nicht 100% scharf ist, hat man keine Chance es zu verbessern und dadurch wird einem schnell schlecht.Ausserdem ist der 'Saferoom', den man sich selbst createn kann, völliger Schrott. Allein im Tutorial muss ich nach ner Rakete greifen, die ausserhalb meines selbstabgesteckten freien Raumes ist.Viele Spiele konnte ich noch nicht testen, da ersteres Problem schnell dazu führt, dass man das gerät ausschaltet!

Meine Tochter ist begeister. Sie wollte ein VR-Set, das benutzt werden kann, ohne Kabel zu verlegen oder von Kabeln am Headset gestört zu werden. Bezahlbar sollte es auch sein. Das wurde mit diesem VR-Set erreicht. Die Bildqualität ist lt. Ihrer Aussage gut und muss sich vor großen Lösungen mit Kabel nicht verstecken.Einziges Manko ist das unbequeme Kopfband. Nach Austausch gegen ein Vakdon Kopfpolster ist alles bestens.

Ich bin sehr begeistert von der Oculus Quest 2, vorallem durch ihre ""Switch"" ähnliches System. Immerhin kann man sie im Stand Aline Modus schon sehr gut nutzen. Aber wenn man bereits einen starken Gaming Computer besitzt, kann man auch noch auf eine Menge an Oculus Rift Spiele zurück greifen. Dafür wird zwar ein Recht teures Linkkabel benötigt oder ein guter Router für ""AirLink"". Ich kann nichts am Gerät aussetzen, ausser vielleicht den noch vorhandenen Facebookzwang, der aber bald hinfällig werden soll laut Meta. Aber zum Apps kaufen sollte man eine Kreditkarte besitzen, da mit EC-Karten von Maestro nichts zu machen ist.

Die Oculus/Meta Quest 2 ist eine wirklich gute VR Brille.Ich kann für sie jedem nur empfehlen, der sich auch nur im entferntesten für VR interessiert.Hier ein paar Tipps für Leute dennen schnell schlecht wird:1. Nicht einfach wieder verkaufen und VR abschreiben!!2. Regelmäßige Pausen machen.3. Immer wieder neu versuchen.4. Irgendwann geht die Motion-Sickness von alleine.Aber bitte nicht für Kinder unter 13 Jahren kaufen.Es gibt aktuell echt noch eine Menge Dinge in VR, die Kinder nicht sehen müssen oder sollten.Abgesehen davon machen Kinder den meisten anderen Spielern die Spiele kaputt.

Die Brille ist saugeil. Funktioniert prima. Nur habe ich ein zu kleines Zimmer, so dass ich mich nicht so richtig im Gitter bewegen kann. Ansonsten bin ich aber sehr zufrieden.

Good hardware rendered useless by mandatory facebook login. All problems caused by fb account. Also using with vpn should be easier.
