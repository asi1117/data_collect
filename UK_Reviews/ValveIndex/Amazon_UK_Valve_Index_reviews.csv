This product completely failed and Support told me there was nothing they could do.  $900 for worthless junk.

Product came in factory/sealed packaging with no signs of tampering/damage. Minus the increased price due to shortages (thanks Valve) this wasn’t a horrible purchase. My feelings are you either wait an indefinite amount of time and save a few hundred dollars, or pay the surcharge to have it in a day or two. I opted for the latter. You are paying for convenience/time.

Expensive but with the shortages, you sometime have to pay the gouge tax if you want it now
