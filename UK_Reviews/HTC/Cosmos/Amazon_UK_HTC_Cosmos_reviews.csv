It worked straight away and was great. But now it won't turn on reliably and keeps popping up with an error that I have corrected multiple times.I feel like it's supposed to be an easy setup but I've been here hours now.I realize it was only just released so software updates could fix some issues, but it's very annoying that I now basically can't use it despite doing everything right (as far as I can tell).If I was you I'd wait and check the reviews a bit more.

I moved to this headset from Oculus Rift S, thinking I was upgrading my experience since this is nearly twice as expensive, I could not be more wrong.The inside-out tracking in this headset is shockingly rubbish, first of all you need coloured walls, ceiling and carpet floors with lots of features and patters everywhere to even get it to start tracking its position, you need the room to be blindingly bright (I had to use 5x 1000+ lumens around the room to get it bright enough so this thing decides to track. After it starts tracking, you just have to look down for 2 seconds and it looses it! the controller tracking is even worse, they only show up if stare at them directly, as soon is you move them to sides of your field of view, they start going bonkers, turn your wrists around and they fully disconnect, no title is playable with this headset. It feels like beta testing something that is in early stages of development and nowhere near close to being a working consumer product and also paying £700 out of your pocket for beta testing it! this is going back.Rift S was a 1000 times better experience than this, just a shame it runs at 80 Hz which does not agree with my stomach.

To say I am disappointed with Amazon would be an understatement. I purchased this product on Sunday 26/01 for £699, the early hours of 27/01 the price dropped to £599 and this evening the current price is £549. Now I received the headset on Sunday, however it seemed to have a tracking fault as the controllers would go all over the place and the left headphone would not click into place like it should. I returned the headset for another one, however after being delivered today it has the exact same issue (Both tracking and headphone) - Shocking. How can a product that has cost me £699 be so bad? Not fit for purpose. Having owned and used the Oculus Rift (First Gen), HTC Vive (First Gen) and Oculus Rift S, I can safely say that this is the worst VR experience I have ever had!

I've had this set for about a few months, playing on and off on different games and honestly it's the best thing I've ever tried. I've spent years thinking on it, and trust me I didn't want to rush into a £700 purchase. I mean, I got the thing on payments, too, which Amazon is awesome to do.The Cosmos is great, and it comes with a great benefit: LESS CABLES. For those of you who don't know, having the usual set of VR (vive, for example) means that not only you're going to have to deal wth the cable running to your headset, but then also the cables for your controllers. Also, generally there's only 1 cable running through the headset to a 'splitter box' that then connects three cables to the PC.Overall, the sharp graphics are great, the depth of vision is great and it's comfortable enough.Owning a VR headset isn't something that just comes out of a box, there is set up. For those who want try it, and actually enjoy this product, there's a few steps that:- SIGN UP FOR BETA UPDATES AND UPDATE BEFORE PLAYING: Seriously, so many people here complaining about the tracking, and sure I ran into a few problems like that myself but it all stopped once I updated using BETA updates. Do yourself a favor and do that to BEFORE you try the headset. It honestly solved a bunch of the tracking issues, and works 90% of the time as intended.- WASH YER DAMN LENSES: That means inside and outside, using microfibre cloth and something with rubbing alcohol, like those glasses wiping cloths.- KEEP THE SET AWAY FROM SUNLIGHT: It damages the lenses and the plastics, seriously. Keep it in a box or a darker part of the room.- TURN IT OFF AT THE SWITCH BOX: There's a little blue button at the 'splitter' switch box, make sure once you're done and quit a game you click it. Otherwise the VR keeps on running on standby, shortening the lifespan.- OVERHEAD AND UNDERFOOT: So many complain about this, but I found that all it takes is a lamp above me, and a lamp aimed at might feet from a little distance away. Does it make me look like a doofus? Yes. Does it work better? Absolutely. And no, you don't need expensive lamps, just a good mixture of yellow/white lamps, go for something like LED lamps that are on the brighter side.- CLEAN YOUR COMPUTER FROM DUST: Seriously, you want VR to run smoothly, give your computer a clean once in a while so the temperature doesn't stutter it's performance.

As far as modern VR headsets go, this is absolutely the best available.But HTC seem to be having some kind of holy war with Steam about game content, and as a result, none of the big game titles support this headset even if they claim to support HTC Vive. e.g. Fallout 4, Skyrim, Subnautica, Batman, etc, etc.Without the games to play, it's basically a very expensive brick.

TL;DR : a great headset with constantly improving tracking. Excellent clarity and modular.So, I was sceptical of getting this headset because of all the bad reviews. But, to be honest, it’s. Great little headset.The tracking has come along leaps and bounds since I got it in January. Be sure to download the beta software to keep the tracking at its most current.Beatsaber is great, Arizona sunshine is playable but I couldn’t get along well with Pavlov until the March update. Now it’s far more manageable.I truly believe this will continue to improve over time.One of the biggest advantages for me is the fact that I use this headset with my laptop. Hence, the inside out tracking is amazing for portability and something I could not be without.

Great build quality all round but the tracking out of the box isn't quite as good as the competition. In order to get the best out of it you have to really follow and understand the guides when installing and maybe do a little research as the environment has to be right.I have now got the best conditions to get a good experience and now prefer this to the Rift S. The Rift S was easier to setup but felt cheap compared to the Cosmos. The Cosmos has a smaller sweet spot lens setup but has much better image quality. Higher resolution, deeper blacks, better contrast and colour. The Cosmos also has vivid and night view modes and better audio. It has bigger and more robust controllers. It also has an actual power button unlike the Rift S.Make sure to enable beta updates in the settings to receive the latest firmware for a better performance.

I'm no expert but this has been a positive experience for me. People complain about the tracking on the Cosmos but its my first headset and it seems OK. Maybe the Valve is better but it costs a small fortune and maybe the Quest 2 is better but then you've got Zuckerberg monitoring every move you make so that's out. Possibly the HP Reverb but that's made by HP so definitely NO! If I could have got hold of a PS5 I may have gone with PS VR but I live in the UK and am not one of the 500,000 lucky people who've managed to get one so nope. Anyway I've played Saints and Sinners, Moss and Halflife Alyx and in truth I'm blown away - this is great fun and not too bad to set up.

Bought 28 Jan 2020 and had thought it was going to be good. Unfortuneatly at the time and I don't know if it is sorted now but the tracking was absolutly awful I had to get into the beta version just to get the rigtht controller to work and still the left one didn't work. I don't write reviews much but at the time when bought it was very bad. Had to be sent back. I gave the extra star as it I did like the design of it and controllers but a let down on the software side. Hoping now it is fixed. But since Quest 2 is out I find it hard now that they would've got any buyers since. I do hope their next reveal will be better on the software side.

I purchased this headset on a whim - previously having the original HTC Vive. I wasnt blown away by the newer technology, although the setup/wiring was far cleaner and very easy. I found the tracking to be no problem at all, using in both a lighted room, and an unlighted room without issue. The build quality seemed fine - although the headphones stopped working on my device after only a couple of hours use. For a £700 product, this is not what you would expect - and I had an issue with the location/grab of the headphones. Whichever position I had them in, they never really encompassed my ear comfortably. The final bugbear was the batteries - AA batteries in the handset is poor. I knew the system did require these before purchase, - but did not believe how quickly the device went through them. About an hour and 15 minutes per pair of batteries.

In haste, I purchased one of these after experiencing some issues with my Rift S, that Oculus either could not or would not fix.This was a massive mistake. This headset works as a VR headset, but as a very low-quality one.The inside-out tracking is sub-par. And that is me being generous.It was an absolutely nauseating experience, using this headset. I could be sitting still, and it would be continually drifting about as though I were moving around.And that really dwarfs its qualities. It is comfortable, easy to use and has an intuitive design.It is also compatible with Steam, which is - to me - quite a selling point over its direct competitor, the Rift S.But even then, you should go for the Rift S. It is cheaper, and the tracking won't be so quick to turn your stomach.

Excellent headset only marred by the really awkward setup. Don't expect this to work from the get-go but (windows 10 user here) if it does, you are clearly blessed by the driver gods. For me it took me several installs attempts and crucially reboots to get this going. Once it was set up everything was always fine, it's not a fan of dark areas be warned, but a few lamps sort that out. This has worked fantastically on Beat Sabre and Half Life Alyx.

The FoV on this product is ridiculous, you won't feel immersed or as though you are even in VR. The sweet spot is so tight that actually getting a clear image in the headset is also practically impossible without constantly fidgeting with it. The worst thing? The sensors don't work properly, even in high light environments it states you need to turn up the lights. Sent back immediately, expecting a full refund. IF Vive had any conscience, they would pull this broken product. Also note i'm writing this in October 2020.

This is by far the worst headset on teh market. Only after you buy it do they suggest you have patterned wallpaper to help with tracking. you'll also need your play space to be lit close to teh surface of teh sun for it to work at night. The software is lame, i returned it.Whoever gave this a 5 star rating is lying or didn't use it for very long. The controller sensors perform worse that the Rift S did on launch.

This is the epitome of examples of why not to be the early adopter! Every review of this headset is negative in some way about the tracking of headmovement and/or controllers. I had dismissed this headset in october 2019 after some really bad reviews here and on Youtube. I was looking for a midrange headset for use sitting down and playing DCS World, digital Combat simulator. The Index was my goal but I could not get hold on one and it was too expensive. I gave up on VR for some time.Then, in late march 2020, I had a heart surgery and needed to isolate myself from my family in order to avoid Covid 19 as I am in a highrisk group. I started to look for a hedset again and I realised that the reviews on the Cosmos had swayed to more positive ones. All because some rather vast updates in firmware for the headset and controllers. Now it was a different ballgame!I will break down what is important for me:1. Comfort.I have prescrition glasses. I need to wear glasses while playing. It works well for me, I have mediumsized glasses. The headset sits snuggly on my head once I adjusted it and it is easy to find a good fit.2. IPD-adjustment.My IPD, ie the pupillary distance, is 70 mm. This mean that some headsets are not for me. This headset have a turning knob that allows for adjustments of the lenses up to 73 mm. This is a huge thing for me! I never got a clear picture in HP Reverb.3. Screen Door Effect.The space between pixels can be seen as a screendoor effect in all headsets. I happens because we look att displays through a strong magnifying lens. Look at your phone with a 10x or stronger loupe to see what I mean. This headset have a small screendoor effect which I think is good.4. Picture quality.In short, great! Good colors and contrast. The resolution is OK. Half Life Alyx looks simply fantastic! As does FS Flightsimulator and DCS world.5. Sweetspot.Now this is tricky! The sweetspot is the headsetplacement you need to have  to get optimal viewing and picture quality. Since I have glasses on while playing I need to fiddle a bit before I start playing to get a good sharp picture for each eye. Without glasses you will be able to get your eyes closer to the lenses in the headset. That will increase the chances of getting optimal viewing at once. Or finding the ""sweetspot"". There is also thinner faceplates to buy to change the included thick faceplate to let you get even closer to the lenses.With my glasses on I would say that the sweetspot is a little small and takes some work to get right.6. Functionality and compability.Headtracking and tracking och the controllers work great. Nothing to complain about. Again, Halflife Alyx, DCS world and a lot of games I tried works great. After two hours of gaming, the headset feels warm. If a lot of people will share it I would recommend buying extra face plates so each person can use their own.Please note. If there are no details in your playspace for the cameras to pick up, tracking will suffer. Only bare white walls will be a problem.7. Controllers.I have tried a lot of games and the only problem I came across was when setting upp the Skyrim VR controller. In all fairness this was the first game I tested after DCS world and I had yet to learn how the Steam VR mapping app works. I had no patience so I choose my Xbox Elite controller and started playing. It is also a great experience!Half Life Alyx worked out of the box and so did the other games I tried. My advice is to buy good rechargeable AA-batteries since you will use up a lot of them. I like the controllers! No fingertracking, but I haven't missed it.8. Price.I bought this on an springsale at 560 pounds. For the price it is great value!Having played the valve Index at my friends house I was going to buy that but the Covid 19 put a stop to that. It wil take 3-4 months to get the index delivered to Sweden where I live.This headset has the same picture quality, but it has a more narrow viewing angle (110 instead of 135 degrees).This headset has a screendoor effect on par with the index.This headset have an IPD adjustment as do the Index.This headset has a more narrow sweetspot than the index.I got the headset for 560£ with controllers and the Index complete package cost 1100€.Problems?I had problems installing the headset.I have a PC with a 8770K i7, 32GB ram, Nvidia 1080 GTi. The linkbox to the headset requires 1 USB3.0 and 1 Displayport contact. I have newer USB 3.1 gen 2 in my PC and the headset would not detect. No. Matter. What.After updating bios, drivers and Windows 10, still nothing.Then I decided to go totally against recommendations and use a USB-hub built into my screen for the linkbox. That has USB 3.0.I also chatted with a flight sim guy at Youtube and he had the same setup as me. It worked great for him.I checked off our hardware and realized that he had a Full HD screen and I run a 4K screen.Once I lowered my screen resolution to 1920*1080 and used the USB-hub in the screen it all worked!And it works perfectly ever since. Maybe it is  bit too much for my pc to power the 4K screen and the headset at the same time.This hassle is what cost the headset one star and my review therefor lands on four solid stars!I hope all this will help anyone who is interested in this headset.

Nonostante le informazioni molto discordanti online riguardanti questo prodotto l’ho comunque acquistato dando fiducia ad HTC.Dopo gli aggiornamenti di gennaio (1.0.9.6) posso dire che il tracciamento è stato reso efficace. Non la perfezione assoluta, ci siamo ancora distanti, ma comunque si riesce tranquillamente a giocare alla maggior parte dei titoli.Nello specifico il problema che maggiormente affliggeva l’unita era, e tuttora è in parte, il tracciamento dei controller, specialmente nella mira a due mani (come in Pavlov), nell’avvicinamento degli stessi alla testa e nella predittività della loro posizione quando dietro alla testa. A parte la prossimità al capo, ancora un po’ critica, il resto sembra funzionare egregiamente, diciamo che siamo oltre l’85-90% come precisione. Sicuramente dando un po’ di fiducia vedremo la precisione arrivare ai livelli di altre piattaforme come Rift S.Questo per quanto riguarda i problemi che affliggevano l’unità.Parliamo ora del resto.DesignL’hmd è tendenzialmente ben fatto anche se le plastiche specie dei controller non sono quelle del vecchio Vive, anche quest’aspetto evidenzia il fatto che Valve ha lasciato per dedicarsi ai suoi visori.ComfortIl comfort per me è ottimo, porto gli occhiali e comunque riesco ad utilizzare bene il visore, utile anche il controllo della distanza interpupillare. Nello specifico vorrei evidenziare che il sistema è messo in posizione e bloccato sul capo da un arco Halo-like, molti lo trovano più scomodo delle fasce del Vive originale, in realtà trovando la posizione giusta riesco a far aderire bene il visore al volto così da non far filtrare neanche un filo di luce dall’esterno. Trovo inutile per me la sollevabilità del visore avendo gli occhiali, non si riesce ad “aprire” agevolmente con gli stessi.Per quanto riguarda il padding lo trovo molto morbido ed avvolgente, peccato che la parte sulla fronte non sia rimovibile per il lavaggio.Infine chicca che trovo molto utile è la piccola ventola che impedisce la formazione di condensa.Nel complesso si lascia portare tranquillamente per  quell’ora massimo 2 di sessione gioco in vr (di più almeno io non riesco ad affrontare il vr senza pause).SchermoC’è poco da dire, ottima la risoluzione, screen door appena percettibile, diciamo che il miglioramento rispetto alla prima generazione si nota. Il fov non è elevatissimo, paragonabile al vive ed agli altri visori in commercio. La frequenza di refresh è più che adeguata, non ho mai avuto fastidi correlati.Nel complesso quindi lo consiglio se volete il massimo come risoluzione in ecosistema Steam VR risparmiando qualche soldo sull’index ed evitandovi i tracciatori esterni.Terrò aggiornata questa recensione in base alle novità e miglioramenti dei prossimi mesi.
