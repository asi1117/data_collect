If anything goes wrong that needs to be snet for repair, Vive support are atrocious. The front line support are helpful, but don't have answers for anything, nor any authority to make decisions. Everything is escalated to ""another team"" with a 3-5 response time.My controller was sent to Vive's 3rd party repair center for warranty repairs. They determined it was water damaged. (It can only have been sweat from normal usage.) The service centre don't accept any queries at all, they just send bills. Vive support don't know what happens in the service centre, they just raise tickets.My query to explain his the damage falls outside warranty through normal use never got an answer. I eventually gave up and paid the release fee so I could return the entire system to the retailer for a refund.To pay the release fee the 3rd party service centre wanted sensitive personal data (passport number or copies of official ID) just to generate an invoice. After lots of emails to both service centre and Vive, they eventually relented and generated the invoice.Being 2020 I had an expectation of modern payment solutions. The only method of payment accepted by the 3rd party service centre is International bank transfer to an account in Romania.Vive support didn't know if this was normal or not. They seemed to think that wasn't ok, but told me there was nothing they could do.When the kit works, it's great. If you need to send anything of for repairs, I highly recommend you handle it via the retailer who has legal obligations under the Consumer Care Act 2015 that you cannot use to compel the manufacturer.tl;dr;After this experience I would never recommend Vive hardware to anyone. It broke in normal use, and Vive just wanted to charge for repairs. It's impossible to talk to anyone directly. Live support only reaches the front line team, who have no authority to make decisions on anything.In other news Overclockers handled the complaint excellently as soon as the Consumer Care Act was mentioned.I only wrote this review because Vive was showing up as a sponsored result.

Great vr for steam fsx (flight simulator).Flyinside is an add on to make fsx vr compatible. Google it. Worth it. Be aware the default flight is a microlight 1000ft above a tropical island. Easy on a monitor but the scale and precarious feeling in vr takes some getting used to. I managed to land without ejecting my dinner though. Suggest use a 747 jumbo jet first, with all that metal around you , you feel more secure.Try it! You won’t look back!

After each element of the kit went through a number of upgrade cycles one of the base stations was showing a 'blinking red light'. This appears to be a known error with no official guidance on how to resolve. The community have various hacks to 'fix' it going back several years. All very amateurish for a supposedly top of the range product.Unless you fancy hacking around json files and potentially bricking your unit stay clear of this utter trash product.

I purchased this primarily to experience Skyrim in all it's glory, but I was severely disappointed.The product is beautifully packaged, with sections for each item and the product appears to be very solid and well made.  This is as far as my appreciation reaches.Before purchase, I registered with Steam VR to run a performance check, to  ensure that my computer was ""VR Ready"".  My Alienware M15, 1TB SSD, 16GB RAM laptop with 4K graphics was more than capable of running VR with little effort, so I was good to go.I took care to set up the equipment as per instruction.  I set the base sensors on top of lighting tri-pods to ensure best distance and angle was achieved.  (NB: the set comes with screws to fix to walls, but I would strongly discourage doing this.  I originally used Command picture strips to temporarily wall-mount the sensors before I obtained tri-pods).Upon removing and setting up the Headset, I found that the supplied cable was incompatible with my Alienware laptop.  I had to purchase a mini-display port to mini-display port cable before I could attach the headset.Once I had the correct display port cable, using Steam VR app, I ran updates on each of the devices:  Headset, 2 x controllers, 2 x base sensors.  I then ensured that each device was correctly linked.After this, I ran the room set-up to calibrate the headset and 2 x controllers to actually begin to play a VR game.  This is where the pain started!Firstly, it took many, many attempts to get the headset and the 2 x controllers to synchronise and calibrate.  Eventually, after many re-boots, re-linking and room set-ups, the devices appeared to be in sync.I placed the headset on and was inside the Steam VR ""home"" area.  I was immediately disappointed at the poor image/graphic, as it was very blurry.I adjusted the IPD, (this is the button that adjusts the eye pupil distance) and also adjusted the headset.  Neither of these things helped and I was feeling nauseous.I removed the headset, checked the internet and Vive Pro app for assistance, but nothing was really clear to assist with the blurry image/graphics issue.I put the headset back on, to try to adjust video in Skyrim game, but the headset image/graphics were up-side-down and it was impossible to adjust without a full re-boot, re-sync and running room setup again.  After doing this several times, it appeared to sync again.With the headset on, I went into Skyrim VR game settings and adjusted video/graphics and also in Steam VR settings.  This still did not help the blurry graphics and stated that I had to re-boot for the settings to take effect.  I did this, then had to do it several more times for the headset and controllers to sync again.After all this and many hours later, this still did not help with the blurry graphics.  I was severely running out of patience.There appeared to be very little support and assistance from Vive Pro online and the only assistance came from Steam VR Skyrim forums.  They recommended downloading mods to custom adjust the graphics.I did as some had recommended, but I still did not see any benefit from this as the headset and controllers just would not stay synchronised and the headset graphics kept glitching constantly!I eventually lost patience and returned the device without a backward glance!I am very disappointed, as I had thought obtaining the more expensive spec device would assure me a better experience.

Disappointing:  Expensive, glitchy and very temperamental
