So going from Valve Index and Quest 2 I have a fair bit of experience of what makes a good headset, and I've tried some dogs like the Pimax 8KX.This isn't as bad as that, but it doesn't thrive anywhere.The visual clarity, as another review says, is poor - glare-ridden and there's basically no sweet spot at all. The SDE is barely visible which is a plus, but unfortunately the square lenses make it feel like you're looking through a space helmet, as opposed to Index's organically circular visual space.And yes, the sound is bad. It's poor. Not only is the quality rotten but it buzzes constantly - a known issue, apparently.Comfort-wise? It's ok - lacks a lot of adjustment really, but at the end of the day the only real positive I can spin on this is lack of SDE.Both headsets I had also failed on me - one turning on and off on its own, the other developing white specs at the bottom of the lens.A bit of a fail, HTC, I'm afraid. Bit of a fail.

Good points about this headset.Comfortable, 5k resolution, fov.Bad points.Audio is worse than a pair of headphones from a pound shop. Can’t get base stations to go sleep with this. The sweet spot for focus is minimal, the glare. You need an extra gig of storage for vive.It really is a shame. I can cope with glare, I can also cope with the minimal sweet spot. But the design makes wearing decent headphones a problem so I have to just send them back.I already have a valve index and audio is amazing for off ear. So much depth and clarity.

If you own a PC with a 3080 or equal then this is great, better images when running in ultra. Unfortunately my system is not as good as my friends and I can’t run in extreme or ultra so I have had to return

I was not able to use it since I didn't have the the base station and controlls.I was shoked to discover that I had to pay extra to get these things to make it work!Not worth it!

Es muy buen casco 5k virtual VR pero prefiero el de Microsoft el HP Reberb G2 4K como el mejor VR de mercado porque es un diseño óptimo pues incorpora las cámaras de seguimiento en en mismo casco VR prescindiendo de las estaciones bases y un sistema de seguimiento fabuloso sin precedentes que puede interactuar en una habitación mucho más pequeña e incluso en un habitáculo muy reducido con una precisión inigualable hasta ahora!.
