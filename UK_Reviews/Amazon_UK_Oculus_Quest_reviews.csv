My Oculus Quest 64GB arrived today.  I was sweating, bare chested dancing with an alien and boxing within 15 minutes, but I’ll start from the beginning and I’ll take about my BOUNDARY-SHIFT!-----------------UNBOXING /  HEADSETThe box (pictured) is quite substantial.  A very solid box inside the outer sleeve, contains all the gear with dense padding affixed inside giving a feel of assurance and quality.Taking out the headset first, I felt the fabric coating around the sides.  This gave an extra feel of quality and it certainly felt different from the cheaper plastic of the Go.  I wondered at this point if it were appropriate however since people *might sweat whilst using this and the fabric would absorb it.  The padding around the headset which makes contact with the face appears to be the same foam as the Go.  This too will definitely soak up sweat, though arguably necessary for comfort - and you’re going to want that playing for long periods of time.The front of the headset is a nice smooth, ‘premium’ plastic with the logo Oculus embossed at the bottom.  Four cameras shine an aura of blue in each corner and it’s these things which marked the most interesting feature I wanted to see - augmented reality - awareness of the room!The colour is of the headset is black with the fabric taking on a more dark grey colour.Buttons / ports on the headset include: Volume + and -, focus slider and two headphone jacks at either side.  The focus slider makes a literal mechanical horizontal adjustment to the two screens behind the lenses I believe.There’s a fixed shape rubber band at the back of the headset with side and upper velcro adjusters.  I put the headset on, resisting powering up, and found I only had to adjust each side by 1cm or so.  Once it’s secured to your face, there’s a ‘give’ in the elastic which allows you to pull it out a few centimetres from your face.  I found this such more more comfortable than the Go which relies upon elastic to hold on the head.  What’s more you can slide it back in to reduce the overall headset size when not in use and slide back out (to your preset head size) when you put it on.There’s a smaller box inside containing: USB cable, 15w USB AC adapter, a ‘frame friendly’ spacer (for those who wear spectacles), instructions and 2 AA batteries - one for each controller.All present nicely and very Mac like.—————————TOUCH CONTROLLERSThe controller also  have two textures.  Smooth plastic on top with a very pleasing rubber with plenty of grip on the underside which is very subtly ribbed.The buttons comprise; trigger, side trigger, shiny Y and X buttons reminiscent of an XBOX controller, a thumb-stick reminiscent of a Nintendo Switch controller and an Oculus button.  The trigger and side trigger are used for various ‘hand’ functions such as grab and point, though this will differ according to the application.  The Oculus button is used to reset alignment on screen.  A double click of this button takes you back to the home screen.  Each controller has what feel like a smooth suede wrist strap for safety so you don’t launch them by accident.The controller feel very similar to the Go, apart from the buttons and thumbtack are where the smooth touchpad is, and of course, there’s a big sensor ring at the end.Overall feel is very robust and they have a slight weight to them since they contain the all important….RUMBLE.  Now we can feel the action.  Fire a gun and we feel the kick.  Get punched in the face, we feel the impact.———————————STARTING UP  ***SPOILERS***It took me a good minute to find the power button since it blends against the side of the headset.  Pressing it, nothing happened and I assumed it may need a charge, but holding it a little longer and more firmly it switched on.Racing to fit it in my head to eagerly admire the image quality difference between this and the Go, I put it on.  The Oculus logo was there - a little bit closer than what I remember on the Go, much brighter, but blurred.  It took the same level of physical up and down adjustment as it did with the Go.  Once you do it, it’s easy to do it again, which is fortunate since it’s always necessary.  On the Quest however, we have the focus slider at the button of the headset which slides the inner screens to give an even greater focus in accordance with ones own eye spacing.  I was at the startup screen and though dull and monotone colours were present, the vividness was already showing.After pairing with the app on my iPad which I already has installed for the Go, I connected to WiFi (it failed to connect to my extender, but this doesn’t matter to me) and I was prompted that a download was taking place.  This took around 15 mins.Once complete I wasn’t greeted with the typical home screen I’m used to.Instead, I was suddenly looking at my sitting room in a monochrome 3D.  I was shocked.I was then prompted to set the floor level and draw a line around the safe areas of the floor to mark a boundary, which if I stepped close to or over, it would warn me.  Quickly putting my cat in another room, I put the headset back on and drew my boundary.  It set up a visible matrix in my sitting room.  This was getting good!With that done, I was left standing in the middle of my sitting room in darkness (on the screen) before being whisked into a totally immersive, vibrant psychedelic intro. I said ‘wow’ and I meant it.  The Go hasn’t managed to deliver this level of experience!  Fractals flying everywhere, I eventually lay to rest standing in a room with objects and activities to learn how to use the controllers which act as hands to point and make fists.  I set off rockets, played punchball and played a shooting game which was great in its own right and I felt the RUMBLE for the first time which was effective.The immersiveness is outstanding  The colours are outstanding in comparison to the subtly washed out colours of the Go.  I felt part of it and inside of the experience.I could physically walk around my living room inside of this cage / matrix which would only appear of I got close to its boundaries.  The the REAL room would show.  If I’m half in, half out, or if I stick my head throw the boundary, I can see half VR, half real room.  Absolutely and utterly bizarre!Next I’m standing in a room and I have to physically walk over to an alien robot character to dance.  I danced for 5 minutes sweating.At one point I braved an eloquent twirl.  The twirl was a mistake.  I witnessed what I called ‘BOUNDARY-SHIFT’ (You heard it here first).  The boundary as I later found out, after hitting my knuckles full force on my door frame, had shifted about 15 cm to the read of my sitting room.  The ‘safe zone’ was now over the doorframe, my standing acoustic guitar my fireplace.  Not good.  I did find however after testing, that it is very reliable.  Just ensure that you don’t do an eloquent twirl or you’ll witness BOUNDARY-SHIFT.The overall recommended area to clear in the room is 2m x 2m, but I only have a narrow sitting room and adjoined bedroom in my apartment which gives me a 1.5m narrow strip of floor, which is adequate.  Naturally, there’s also an option for being stationery too.  A personal boundary is present with this option.———————IMAGE QUALITYColours are much more vibrant that the Go as mentioned. This no doubt will be due to the OLED technology in each of the two lenses.  Although I assumed this would be nice, it’s more than that.  It adds lot to the immersiveness.  The resolution looks  better.  The Quest, has 400 more pixels per eye than the Go if I remember, but the pixel comparisons were deemed void due to sub pixels being a factor.Oculus Go: 1280 x 1440 per eye - 5.5-inch display Oculus Quest: 1,440 x 1,600 pixels per eye - 72Hz OLED display.Difference: 160 x 160 (for what it's worth). Most notably the ‘screen door effect’ (grinding) looks about 50% less and this does add a lot to the immersiveness.  Everything is a lot more clear than the Go and you actually feel like you're in the VR location.  It all feels a lot more real - almost like looking through binoculars without magnification.There seems to be less eye strain.  Less effort to have to process the image with the brain.  It’s just more relaxed and more easy to look at.  It's like being there, whereas the Go had a constant feel of looking at a screen.The level of depth is so much more greater than the Go.Glare is actually very noticeable when there’s a bit of white on a black background - a splash screen for example with a logo, but thankfully this dissipates when an array off colours are presented simultaneously.  The focus slider the the bottom of the headset can also help to reduce glare - or at least the most prominent position of the glare.Though this isn’t directly related to image, there was a slight bleed of light seeping through the nose bridge of the headset.  This is noticeable too when there’s a black background or dark scene.  It’s very slight (at least in the case of my nose).——————SOUNDThe sound appears to be pretty much the same as the Go with the speakers situated in the side straps.The lows, mids and highs seem around the same.The only difference which I think I noticed was that the max volume was a little lower which didn’t make any difference.I must admit, I’m sure why there are two headphone sockets at either side of the headset, so comments regarding this would be appreciated.*** I will be experimenting with a pair of Senheisser HD650s later.———————————APPS & GAMES / PERFORMANCEI was quite surprised at the very limited selection of games and apps available currently on launch.I do intend to take my time and appreciate each individual game before I buy the next, but the Store does seem very empty currently.I still have a lot more to discover, but at this point it looks like my Go games aren’t compatible since they aren’t on the store.  it would appear there are two separate stores for Go and Quest.  Understandably so from the standpoint of Go which has lesser hardware, but vice-versa, I’d expect to see all the existing Go games.  Perhaps at this point, I’ve missed something.Regardless, those demo’s I’ve played from the small selection which appeared to have downloaded automatically during installation, they are phenomenal - ‘Rise to Glory’ (Boxing)in particular.  At first, it really is overwhelming (in a good way) when there’s someone right infront of you throwing punches.  It’s really something that has to be witnessed since words do it no justice.Next I played Sports Scramble - a tennis game in which you hit all kinds of sports balls / projectiles and use an array of different bats and objects.  I played literally soaked with sweat against an online opponent.  Thoroughly enjoyable.  A great laugh and pick-me-up.Overall, the degree of accuracy, together with the responsiveness of the controllers to interact with the environment just makes this shine.  It works and it works well!Head tracking appeared to be notably more responsive, so needless to say this gives a more true-to-life experience.  There is no delay and no feel of ‘drag’.  I will be testing this too when then hardware is pushed to close to the limit with a fast action game.** I’m due to buy Robo Recall since this looks like one that’s going to fully test and boast the hardware capabilities.The refresh rate of the Oculus Quest is 72Hz.———————FINAL THOUGHTSThis isn’t just slightly better than the Go. It’s another level entirely.It looks better and this time, it does feel like a virtual world, rather than simply looking at (and around) one.To walk in a virtual world after setting up the boundary matrix in your house / room is something else.Playing tennis, then walking off to poke your head through the grid to see your real room is amazing.Whilst I still have a lot more adventuring ahead of me, I know already that the general experience (with games aside) make this something to buy and experience.I’ve already given my family a Go for xmas, but I can’t wait for them to experience this at the weekend.Having the ability to WALK, and use two hands to handle objects and interact with the environment, just bring this completely to life.If you’re new to VR (and perhaps considering the Go too), Oculus Quest is the one to buy - no question.Everyone needs to experience this!Advantages* Room-scale freedom!* Mixed reality is amazing* Brilliant colour in contrast to the Go — OLED Lenses* Greater feeling of being elsewhere - in a room / place.* Sharper image with much greater feel of depth* More responsive head tracking* Headset fan (when it turns on) is near silent* Comfortable & easy to fit* Much less eye strain & post-disorientation* Quality, responsive controllers with rumble* Good battery life* Comfortable Weight* No PC required* Two controller / hand articulationDisadvantages* Launch titles are limited* Physical games cause the padding to literally soak in sweat* Fabric cover, though nice, is prone to sweat and grime too* Facebook is still required to furnish the home area and watch media* Glare with white on dark backgrounds* BOUNDARY-SHIFT from eloquent twirling

We are absolutely in the future. I was lucky enough to get my Oculus Quest on release day (yesterday, May 21st) and I could not wait to try it. It took me a while to figure out how to put it on, because I wear quite big glasses and have a relatively big head. As it turns out, I was trying to put it on by expanding it over my head, but what you are supposed to do is put the headset up to your eyes FIRST then pull the strap down over the back of your head.Before you know it, it was powered up and I was in the virtual reality world. It looked incredible. The headset's pixel resolution is higher than the Oculus Rift, and so VR looked even better. As soon as you're in, it asks you to draw out your playing space on the floor below you, so that it knows where your boundaries are and can warn you when you get close. You're then popped into a kind of demo where you get to try different things.. wack a ping pong ball with a racket, throw paper aeroplanes, control a blimp via a remote control, etc.There are game demos included on the Quest, including Beat Saber (awesome dance/music game). These are great because they give the player a good feel for what the quest can do, but surely don't come close to fully utilising its capabilities.The user interface is awesome. You can access a web browser, YouTube videos (including 360 videos where you are put INSIDE the video - MUST TRY!), the Oculus Store where you can buy games from within the headset, etc. You can also Cast (stream your gameplay) to a nearby Chromecast-enabled device, i.e. a TV with a Chromecast dongle plugged in. You can also Cast to your phone and laptop.The headset feels a tad bit heavy on the head, and so can be uncomfortable after long periods of gameplay. This is especially the case if you wear glasses, because it will feel like the weight of it is resting on the glasses which are then heavy on the nose bridge. The Quest comes with a glasses spacer though which I can fit in to make it a bit more comfortable. Also you can buy prescription lenses and quickly fit them in, so you can play without glasses on!I've tried the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR. For me, this is so far the best experience in terms of quality. The fact that there are NO CABLES around you is a huge selling point. I really wish I had more space. The more space you have, the better.The truth is, I can write about this for hours and hours. You really have to put it on to believe me when I say how astounding it is. I cannot wait to see what VR is like in 10 years' time if this is what it's like now.Wow.

Fantastic Vr from Oculus,the quest is amazing,wire free.Tracking is great,had a few crash issues and it had to reboot.I pre ordered the 128GB version because I can not believe that there is no SD card slot,other manufacturers have a card slot of 256gb but Oculus have not.An extra £100 for 64gb is a joke,considering a SD card of 256gb cost £15,lol.Big difference in GB price.Also they could have used a better Snapdragon processor,maybe the 855 gaming processor another money grabbing move by oculus.They are my two downfalls on the quest, memory and processor.Overall a fantastic experience,it's the way of the future and new gaming,love it.Have beat saber which is great,Vader is great,needs a big area to play,robo recall is amazing,just brill.UPDATE DEAD PIXEL ON LEFT LENS,MANY REPORTING BAD BATCHES AND OTHER ISSUES.£500 QUID FOR VR THATS SLAPPED TOGETHER.WANT A REPLACEMENT SENT TO ME.WILL UPDATE.

I own three VR headsets (Oculus dev1, Oculus rift cv1, PlayStation VR) and now the Quest.I was mainly using the PSVR, because its convenient to use.However, I will now sell the PSVR and switch to the Quest. After just playing the introduction games and tutorials, the new Rift and Quest is by far the most advanced VR experience to date.- Quest graphics, I’m surprised by the quality of the image clarity. The image seems better than a PSVR, possibly because the display uses a much higher resolution making the image seems sharper, and with just enough antialiasing to make the graphics look less jagged than the PSVR. The Quest’s mobile processor (Snapdragon), which is two generations old, seems able to produce good looking graphics, from the games I’ve played so far, this could be a result of having reduced detail in the environments, but its not to noticeable.Played Creed on PSVR and Quest and the PSVR may have a bit more detail, but the Quest has a better looking image , both play almost identically. But the Quest kills the PSVR when it comes to motion tracking and controller tracking.Motion tracking is where the Quest really impresses, it tracks your head position perfectly the controllers near perfectly, but the real shining light of the whole experience is the room scale tracking. The bigger the room the better, once setup, you can simply roam around your room  while inside the VR environment, and the Quest will show a grid barrier if you stray outside your defined room roaming safe area.once you start roaming around your room, you start to understand why a wireless (cable less) Quest with it less powerful processor can best a PSVR and even the oculus Rift. It feels much more immersive and free (with no cables to trip over).Only 4 stars as its not totally perfect, the headset is a little front heavy, also Oculus should have used newer Snapdragon processor to really up the graphical detail,and where’s the SD card slot (why not)🤔 Update for 2020, there is still not a large selection of games for the Quest, and almost no AAA games. I’m still happy with the Quest.However, if you’re looking to buy a Quest this year 2020, Read below.PS5 is out this year, with what is rumoured to be a PSVR 2. With tracking similar to the Quest, but with the graphical power of PS5. Which is going to be unbelievably fantastic.So please wait to see what Sony do this year before buying a Quest now.

I own most of the available VR headsets and each has their own list of pros and cons. The main issue for most of them is that you need to £1000 PC to access them. Of course a stand alone unit will never be quite as good as your PC running with a £500 graphics card but I don't feel that's the essential part of VR. VR is about an experience and about becoming immersed in a different world. The Quest does this perfectly. Yes the graphics aren't as good - do I notice after the first 5 minutes of robots jumping on my head? No! Robo recall is a perfect example of the differences between the graphics quality of a computer tethered system and the a stand alone. I was amazed that I quickly forgot that the detail was less when I was diving around my kitchen without any cables! I have found it a bit buggy but that's to be expected in the early days of any product. The battery life is reasonable for the amount of time I want to spend in VR at any one time - could be more of an issue if you are sharing it. The lack of IPD adjustment really annoyed me on the Oculus Go (my IPD is borderline for the Go) but the Quest has IPD adjustment and coupled with the lenses it makes for a great experience. If you think of this as a stand alone games console it's great value but you should expect to pay £20 plus for the best games. The Oculus 'cross buy' scheme is a great benefit for those who already have other devices. This means that some developers will give you their game for free on quest if you own it on other platforms. Sadly many developers won't do this as they have had to build their Quest games from the ground up rather than just 'porting' the game. The tracking is amazing for the technology used - i hated this aspect of WMR but Oculus have made it work very well - I would guess this due to the additional cameras. The boundary system is incredible - when you move out of your sale boundary area you get to see a black and white view of you surroundings so you could walk around with the headset on outside of the area (I wouldn't recommend it!) and the game fades back in when you re eneter your safe area.If you want VR and don't have a powerful PC go for this - the games will never outgrow the device. I hate the smell of new Oculus devices (the foam I think) but it will wear off. Buy one of you can!

 So I have been gaming since i was about 5 years old. First playing on a Atari back in its heyday then moving from console to console and PC gaming over the cause of 30 years. I have seen and tried most consoles. they have come and gone and some evolved. But I can honestly say that the future of gaming is here and this feels not only new but for once not a gimmick. I havent in a long time got actual goosebumps when playing a game and I think the other console creators need to pay attention and just admire the pure and fresh take on this gaming industry. Been playing on the console now for a few days and I am absolutely having a blast. I havent played any PC or console gaming since I openned the box.Packaging:First off we have to thank Apple for the benchmarking in packaging. The console is packaged perfectly and as a customer really appricate the effort that goes into something as simple as a box with a well packaged product. This shows pride in a product and I think they nailed this one.The Headset:I have not had a VR headset of my own until now, so I can't really compare it to other VR headsets. But for a first time user I think it fits well. The ways it fits your head is well designed, light and easy to adjust when someone else wants to have a turn. I have been putting in about 4 hour sessions at a time and I just get lost in the immersion. The headset tracking system is incredible and the gaurdian system works extemely well even in smaller rooms. You will, however, need a mobile phone to install the Oculus App to start your adventure.Controllers:This was a something new for me, the tutorial was excellent and blew my mind. It didn't take me long to get the hang of it, and the more you use it the better it gets. My daughter wanted to have a go, she didnt even need the tutorial. I passed her the headset and controllers and she figured it all out in about two beat saber songs. The controllers are very well built and super responsive, I have yet to see any latency in this area.Visuals:This is mind blowing for me. The colours pop out and are vibrant and really makes you feel like you actually in the game. I know there are better headsets out there but just being able to pull this headset out of the box and going into the virtual world is insane. When you start the tutorial (as a novice to this) you will see exactly what I mean. The colours are perfect and it met every expectation I had and so much more.Sound:The sound is in the head straps, is pretty cool. Something new to me again but can't fault it at all. I dont know how they do it but those little speakers are amazing and send a good polished clear sound to both ears. When I am playing on my own I just attach my astros to them and close myself off to the rest of the planet.Games:I have bought most of the games so far that are on the store. I have not had any issues playing any of them. Like I mentioned in the beginning this is the future and the games are fun to play solo or as a family or with friend in turns unless you have more than one console. The game prices are reasonable, but I think they should definetly add more content on a weekly basis. The more games there are, the more we can experience and there sure is a lot to do in there. There are the standard Apps if you into media like Youtube and Netflix and they also look great when you try them out on a cinema side screen.Streaming:You are able to stream your gameplay to Facebook and cast to mobile. It says it can cast to Chromecast but it not working for me so will do some more investigating on it. I have only used the casting fuction to my mobile and it worked for the most part.  There wasnt any issues casting from the home inviroment but there was some games that disabled the casting functionality. Which was a bit of a let down but the game made up for it. I would say that in this area it really falls behind for me. On most consoles and PC you have option to stream where you like to Twitch, Youtube, Mixer and arent forced to use only Facebook this was very disappointing for me.Performance:In this department it works great, you get a great experience from the headset. The contollers compliment the gameplay and its all keeps up nicely, everything seems to work well together  The headset makes almost no noise the fan built into the front of the headset I couldnt hear it at all while playing games. Where it falls down a bit, is with the battery I only get about 2 hours on a full charge. The headset doesnt take to long to change full again though its OK, but not great for me personally. So I ordered a 24800 mah power bank that I put in my pocket. works like a charm. I do wish that the headset lasted longer on its own change but there has to be a sacrifice somewhere.Pros:* PC/Console freedom* Well packaged* Great design* Visuals are amazing* Controllers are well built and very responsive.* Comfortable to wear for long periods* Easy to move from user to user* Sound is awesome with and without headphones* Games play well and are very fun* Games arent expensive* Overall performance is great* Light wieght* Fun factor* Social (If you want it to be)* Game quality is excellent* You not just sitting playing games all day* Active (You will break a sweat in some games)Cons:* Facebook Streaming ONLY* Not enough games in the store yet* Not enough Apps in the store yet.* Battery Life* Not striaght forward to install APKsConclusion:I am very happy I bought this VR headset, its new, its fresh and its blown my mind. If you enjoy gaming and want to move into the VR gaming world this is your ticket. No PC needed just unbox install the Oculus App and play. I will warn you that if you anything like me you will want more than one of these in the home. I would highly recommend this VR headset if you looking to try out VR gaming without any additions.

This is my first experience of 'Virtual Reality' and I am hugely disappointed. From other reviews I assume that it must be better than what has gone before but the image quality reminds me of the early days of colour television  - and that was over 50 years ago! The colours/textures are nothing like 'real' and although the fuzzy text is readable it lacks any sort of crispness. On our TV screens and computer monitors we have become used to superb quality which is in a totally different league from that which we find in the Oculus Quest. I had been expecting great things but would go so far as to say that the quality is so poor that it makes using the device an unpleasant experience. People who find this acceptable must be very patient but surely we should expect something better than this in the present day.

This is great. The level of immersion is fantastic and there are some decent games to play which also have great graphics BUT... I'm coming from Vive which has PC level gaming and graphics. Now that's not to say the games aren't fun as they are but there aren't many at the moment. By the end of the first two weeks, I had most of the games that I wanted to play. I check the store daily and, nothing new to play. So basically I've paid £400 to play just a few games.BeatsaberSports ScrambleRacket FuryDead and Buried 2Some other game with dead in the title...Gameplay - you get about 2-3 hours and then a couple of hours to charge.The controllers are comfortable and responsive for the most part BUT there's a crack in my curtains and occasionally sun light comes in. When it does - it messes with the tracking a little and your controls will disappear. Also the battery compartment on the controller is on the top and when you really swing your arm, the compartment Is magnetic so - three times now - it has almost slipped off. Thankfully I haven't launched the controller yet but this its a design flaw if ever I saw one. It would be better if these clipped in and you had to have a release to undo it. Magnetic is not the way forward. Also with the controllers, occasionally a part of my hand has caught the pause button. Not good in the middle of a combo on beatsaber!Do I regret buying it? No. It's fun. But it's not as sociable as playing on a normal VR unit as people can't watch what you're doing. Supposedly you can cast what you're doing but, so far, I've not got this working on any of my devices.

So far I am blown away by the Quest. I previously had the Go, but this is a massive improvement. It may not be quite as good as a Rift or Vive, but for the price and fact that it is a complete system, it ticks all my boxes and makes proper VR possible on a sensible budget. The look and feel of the Quest are of a quality product (just one example, the neat magnetic closures on the controller battery doors) and even the box it is supplied in is so well designed and made. At present the content available is obviously limited, but it has only been out for a few days. More content will come out soon. In terms of gameplay I just can’t fault it. Everything just works! Draw out your safety “cage” (with a rather surreal black and white view of the world) and then step into VR with perfect coordination of the controllers and response of the headset to movement. It is totally awesome. Even the tutorial is fun (hit a ball, fly a blimp, shoot off some rockets or dance with an interactive robot who mirrors all your moves, or shoot up some cubes and stars with a range of weapons!). I wear glasses and the adapter fitted easily and means I can (like I did with the Go) see things nicely in focus. The casting to a tablet is a bit glitchy and prone to freezing, but this is my only criticism and it is not really a core feature.This is such good fun and well worth the price. Facebook have come in for a fair bit of criticism of late in respect of their social media practices, much of it warranted, but with the Quest they have excelled.

And to help other people in finding out information.- Around 50 apps/games of which 8 will be interesting to you. And most being entertaining for about 2 hours. And it looks like the store has been dead for months and will be for the foreseeable future. They need to look at the WiiU failure and learn from the mistake Nintendo made with lack of content.- There is a screen door effect (Black lines) and while I was standing still looking around I really noticed it. But while moving and playing a game your subconscious ignores it.- The headset is front heavy and wobbles a little if you move your head fast (fabric mask scratches your face).- You get 46GB of useful space after format and OS.- The fabric is NOT soft on the mask and it's really uncomfortable I ordered a rubber mask that I should not have too._ A none replaceable battery and no SD card slot. They seem to be trying to do what apple does unfortunately. This is gaming hardware and gamers don't like upgrading every year in a locked ecosystem with over expensive games that have about 2 hours playability. I give the device about 2 years maybe 1 under heavy use from the way it's been designed.Due to lack of content it seems the few developers with games in the store have decided to over price their tech demos because people have nothing else to play. Being a completely new system they should have made the system more like a PC and open to mods and all. It's nothing like an apple device that sells purely on hardware with an established market. THEY NEED CONTENT FAST! And the best way is to make an open controlled market.

I might use this for a few hours a week. But apparently, if my wife wants to play VR too, she should purchase another VR headset and buy all new games separately because this device doesn't support the very basic feature of multiple user profiles. Literally every other games console or operating system has that feature. Android, which the Quest is built on, has that feature. But for some crazy reason Facebook have disabled it in the Quest.Seriously? We should buy separate headsets and games each for a few hours of diversion a week? And what about when I want a guest to play?Were this feature present I could rate the device higher, but - as a software developer myself - I can't imagine any reason not to include this feature other than money grubbing maliciousness, and it makes me angry.

This is the best VR equiptment out there, completely wireless and cord free, excellent censors and motion control. Would get a 5* review on hardward alone, but unfortunately the software is what I have a major issue with...Now the Quest software itself is excellent, however some dirty practices by Oculus are what have earnt this 1*So... there is limited software/app on the Oculus store, which will grow over time but for the foreseeable future can't really justify the current price.As it will always be, the SteamVR store is where It's at for games! And although you can hack some software on to the Quest so that you can stream SteamVR games, this is something that Oculus are going out of their way to stop, by asking any developer that supports SteamVR streaming on the Oculus store to remove their app, and making it increasingly difficult with every firmware update they release.It's dumb really... If I wouldn't have been able to get the SteamVR streaming, the Quest would have gone straight back for a refund and you would have lost a sale, and I imagine many more would have done the same. Also if a game thats available on SteamVR is available on the Oculus store, I would definitly puuchase it on the Quest, as it will be a better experience when you are playing the game from your hardware, rather than streaming to it. Therefore it makes no sense to me atall that they are doing their best to try and stop this... but here we are.If Oculus start to support streaming to the Quest from the SteamVR store, or atleast stop trying to remove apps that let you, I'd be more than happy to change this review to 5*

I really wanted this to be a success and gave it every chance.However the headset is far too big and heavy to be worn comfortably for more than 20 minutes.Also, the fit is not perfect on the head despite the straps to adjust.Part of the problem is probably the weight of the goggles, which causes them to move about during a game, and in doing so a clear focus is lost.The manufacturer should focus on reducing the weight of the product to make it comfortable to wear.The Star Wars game was awesome to play, and shows the potential of the headset. I will come back to VR in a few years once the devices are smaller and more comfortable to wear and more immersive (I can see light coming from around the edges of the device even in a dimly lit room, detracting from the experience).

I returned mine within a few days. Yes it is fantastic having no wires although I have not used a vr headset other then the Google ones where you put your phone in.I found it very uncomfortable after a small amount of time on my forehead. The main gripe I would say is the quality of the graphics. My girlfriend used it for about 20 minutes, I asked what do you think she replied it's very cartoony! Exactly what I was thinking. She has never ever wore a vr headset before, which is a good un biased opinion. I'm gonna wait for the improved version maybe in a year's time who knows. I'm quite surprised there is a very high percentage of people saying how great it is. I'm pretty surethatnegative reviews are screened and not shown. Anyway thanks for reading.

This is future! I can’t believe they have managed to do this. To create a headset that runs by itself with no PC or console and is also wireless is incredible. Graphics are sharp and everything is smooth. The controllers are flawless and make interacting with environments a joy. Can play for ages and there is no dizziness. Games are easy to download from the app and go straight to your Headset. The games are fantastic and there is already a healthy amount in a very varied library to choose from. Star Wars: Vader Immortal is amazing. It feels like your in your own Star Wars movie. I highly recommend this and yes, £399 is a lot of money, but considering that’s all you need to start gaming, it’s cheaper than most other VR equivalents and comparable in price to something like a PS4 Pro. I don’t think I’ve I’ve had a gaming experience like this since I played Mario 64 with the thumbsticks for the first time or playing GTA3 when it was released. This is finally the next great leap forward in gaming to me. Awesome!

I have had the Quest for a week now, and have used it extensively for that week. My previous VR experience was with the Gear VR, a simple unit that was more like a tech demo to show VR potential than a true VR gaming kit. The Quest, despite being a standalone device, is far more of a gaming device, and if it gets the right support from developers, could be the breakout VR home gaming set for non-PC users.The device itself is of high quality, with everything feeling and looking well made. It is generally comfortable to wear, though it takes a little fiddling to get it just right, and the straps are easy to adjust. The foam and rubber padding makes it feel good on the face, though it is a little heavy and can make you sweat fairly quickly! It has decent speakers, certainly good enough for general gaming, and headphones jacks for private sessions. The display is clear, crisp and bright, with less screen-door than the Gear VR and the only issue being white text on black backgrounds causing glares in the lenses that are annoying, but not game breaking.  It charges on an included USB C cable and lasts 2-3 hours, taking 2 hours approx for a full charge. To be honest, you’ll probably rarely game for more than an hour on this. At least that is what I find.The controllers are perfectly fine, I have no other VR controllers to compare it to, but it compares favourably to an Xbox or PS controller. They run on a single AA and using a decent rechargeable, I am getting a long time out of each charge. The wrist strap I didn’t like but I changed it up for a cheap one that I preferred that I bought just after I got it, but the straps will be fine for most I am sure.In use, it is shockingly simple to manage. Once the setup is done (takes 10mins max) you are just ready to go, mostly without issue. The device seems to remember your play zones, so no recalibrating each time you play. Put it on and you’re gaming in 1-2 mins. Perfect. Tracking works 99% of the time – only real contortions have confused it so far and I am very ‘unaware’ of the fact I am gaming once I get going – I am just enjoying the moment.  It is definitely a ‘your Gran/Granddad could play it’ device. The fact we have a room-scale, no wires full 6dof device for this price is something I was dreaming of when I was mucking around on the Gear VR.I have played a few games, Beat Sabre, Space Pirate Trainer, Accounting+ and Job Simulator. I have played a few demos too. All have their quirks, but Beat Sabre and Space Pirate are just fantastic fun and challenging. Both provide a decent workout too. Job Simulator the kids just adore, and Accounting+ is short but amusing and a must for Rick and Morty fans.Overall, I cannot recommend more to someone like me, who tried 3dof and liked it and wanted the full VR experience, but who doesn’t have a gaming PC.  Sure it might lack the oomph of a Rift S, but it is essentially the same device in other ways and with some streaming options, even this might be overcome. So far I cannot regret this, but I just hope that the device gets the support it deserves.  It is a leap forward, no in tech so much as tech at an affordable and easy to access price and form.EDIT: Have had for another couple of weeks and can still say that the device is spot on. Tried another few games (Red Matter - excellent graphics and atmosphere...) and tried SideloaderVR app which makes adding demos and Beat Saber tracks very easy with some basic 30mins setup. Really expands options having this free addition, I even installed Quake VR using this. Again, for gamers, for tech nerds like me, this is perfect.EDIT 2 - after a few months I still think this is a great device. I am using it less, but still using enough. A few longer term thoughts - Oculus could do with releasing some heavier duty official wrist straps. The included ones did eventually break, they still work but not as well, and the third party ones I have tried suck. And you must get the balance and comfort right or you might hurt your neck. I has to take a 2 weeks break because I played a longer session with the headset on wrong and it strained my neck. There are probably too few games at too high a price, but that isn't a deal breaker as there is enough for now. New features like finger tracking and Oculus Link (for high end VR games via PC) are on the horizon and seem like they will only improve it. Still a solid 5/5, with some slight hesitation over comfort and the strap quality.

I tried this in a shop in London, and within a few minutes I knew I wanted one.I'm not a VR veteran, but I fail to see how you could try this and not be impressed.For pure fun and enjoyment, it is outstanding. I toyed with the idea of buying a PC and a Rift as the graphics are obviously superior, but I know I would have struggled to find time to use it and it would have sat there unused most of the time. This gives so much more freedom. Being able to use this around the house, or take with you to friends or social events.Even my wife was incredibly skeptical about me getting one was bowled over by how good this is.I'm not really a gamer, but the immersion of the gameplay in the games I've tried so far is on another level. Totally blown awayIf you are curious about VR and have a spare £400, then you won't regret buying one.

Great headset for those who either don’t want to be tethered to an external device or can’t afford to build an expensive PC. I’ve currently got both the PSVR and this.Pros:Portability: You can practically take this anywhere; in any room, at a friends or to show off to the family.Convenience: Because there’s no tether, it means you can just pop it on your head and get jump into another world, unlike other headsets which requires you to mess around with cables.Display: Although it has a slightly lower refresh rate, it has a better pixel count, which reduces the screen door effect, which is very noticeable on the PSVR. The OLED display provides amazingly deep blacks and vibrant colours. The lower refresh rate isn’t noticeable even in fast games like Beat Saber.Cons:Battery Life: Depending on what you play, it lasts roughly 2-3 hrs. Which is fine for a quick session but make sure you keep the charger around. Even better, get yourself an external battery bank.Weight: The headset is very face heavy and you’ll start to feel the strain in extended playtimes. I have found strapping a battery bank to the back of the headset help with distributing the weight better.Performance: The headset runs a snapdragon processor that’s now a couple of years old. Although Oculus has optimised the custom version of Android, you can sometimes experience momentary lag. Not enough to throw you totally out of the experience, but enough to be annoyed when it happens.The Oculus Quest is a great bit of kit, especially those wanting an affordable option  while still having the full VR gaming experience. This has not long been released so don’t expect a massive library of games, though more will be sure to come out soon as well as the ability to connect to a PC and play Steam VR games just around the corner. Early next year, Oculus are adding hand and finger tracking which will create a whole new level of VR gameplay. Beat Saber is also working on official custom song support, but in the mean time, you can sideload your own songs and maps using 3rd party software (google it).In conclusion, unless you have a wallet too heavy from all the cash you carry in it, buy this. PSVR, although currently has a bigger library of games, used out of date tracking for the move controllers, has a terrible display and you can’t get custom songs on BS.

Very nice VR experience no need to tell pros as already explained vigorously. I know most of those who have experienced its high resolution with the cool sense it gives, with its great tracking and touch controllers, are too excited in their reviews.Cons with my headset,1- Battery finishes quickly in 1 to 2 hours and having to wear a bag with a charger (get a 1 meter USB to C cable) to enjoy fee movement or to keep it plugged with original charger as it is long enough and most games do not require fast turns.Eg, games like Apex, it doesn't last longer than 70mins2- Lens appears as if having some internal dirt. Ive cleaned it from the outside using the recommended tools, but the dirt keeps like a shadow or a blurred stain; however, i got used to it and kids havent noticed the same.3- Frame rate ranges 50 to 60 and not 70 as was advertised.Of course, this is an old version mobile PC with limited abilities thus don't expect good textures.4- The main con is its processor as it doesn't help to enjoy a real VR experience like with rift or playstation 4 pro. (textures are so simple with minimum shadow and glare)5- Games are very limited in number and very expensive if compared to their short lasting game play. Also, lack of available players in multiplayer games.6-  Most applications have no demo version and refund can be done only if played less than 2 hours.  Most of them you cant get back to earlier levels.7- The facial support of the headset is very rough causing marks of pressure over the face! why do we have to spend more money to get a spongy frame?8- Internal cooling is not very effective, it keeps heating up and requiring fan in the room.9- VR Chat texture is very poor compared to PCVR.I generally would advice to wait for software solutions to its inability to accept charging whilst playing, to improve its processor, to add more flexibility to connect to other steam games taking into account its low performance capacity. My android phone with VR headset whilst having a good controller gets me longer hours of wider variety of games but not to the same immersive effect of having a wider field of view with more pixels ( not too wide as you wont be able to see your hands all the time in Tai Chi)Waiting to see how it functions with VR or 3D movies for its high resolution.If the battery charging issue continues and I be sure this is not only me seeing a smeared lens from the inside I will be returning it.  Also, will be waiting for another few days for a software update hoping it will resolve these issues.Advice: If you don't have patience then buy it, it's fun otherwise you can wait for a new version with faster CPUDont purchase games with short game play as you will waste money on something you wont play twice; instead, pay for the game and play less than 2 hours to test it and then request refund within 14 days from purchasing the app.

Having already owned a Vive with a high-end PC worth around £1400 I was prepared to be disappointed. But I’m not - I’m blown away but how good this is. Sure, there is a tiny bit more motion blur on some apps and a slightly lower graphical fidelity on others, but that splitting hairs and you won’t notice it unless they’re side by side. Space Pirate Trainer is pretty much identical to my £1400 Vive setup (but a hundred times easier to setup and use). Well designed, slick system, excellent performance and amazing value for money.

TLDR: This headset feels like stepping into the future. Everything from the packaging to the operating software screams quality, and virtual reality is an experience straight out of science fiction.What is it?This is a virtual reality headset from Facebook which lets you walk around in virtual space, while tracking your motion, head movement, and hands (a ""6 degrees of freedom"" headset). Effectively, think the holodeck from Star Trek.It is primarily used for gaming, with games ranging from cyber ninja action titles where you triple jump and backflip off walls, to guided tai-chi relaxation apps. My personal favourite is Moss, where you guide a cute little mouse through platforming puzzles. There are also chat rooms (VR chat), and media apps (Netflix, Big Screen).The goodThe engineering quality and attention to detail is unreal. Right from the start, the packaging feels like a premium Apple product. The set up is super easy, involving downloading the Oculus mobile app, and then drawing a play space with the controllers. It does not need a PC, wires, or external tracking.For me, at least, it totally solves all of the problems with existing virtual reality headsets. There is no nausea at all (high refresh rate and low latency), and you do not have to be a tech wizz to get it working. It also uses active cooling, so it doesn't get too hot, and there is plenty of ventilation. If you can use an iPhone, you can use this.The selection of games is good for a two month old device, with Beatsaber (think guitar hero with lightsabers), Superhot (slow motion fighting like 'The Matrix'), and Moss (the mouse game) being my favourite choices. The release schedule is also decent, with a Metal Gear Solid style stealth game (Espire 1) and a Counter-Strike style competitive FPS (Pavlov) in the works.The badFor what it is, the graphics are decent, but not amazing. To keep at the <£400 price range it uses a snapdragon 835 processor, which is around two years old. It is also having to drive 72hz at 1600 x 1440p, which is really demanding. I'd say the graphics are on par with the best PS2/early PS3 games. Do not expect PS4 or Vive Pro quality visuals.At the moment, the selection of social apps is also a bit thin. There is no Facebook app, which is surprising considering that it is a Facebook system, and other major media apps like MelodyVR (music concerts) or NextVR (sports) are missing.There is no 'system seller' 20-30 hour long AAA game like Mario Odyssey or The Last of Us yet. For the most part, the games are either shorter 3-5 hour experiences, multiplayer, or arcade games.

First of all this product is amazing. Most people will write a positive review. It's like owning your own personal holo-deck from star trek.I'm going to write about the experience. I would not recommend this product be bought for children. It could cause eye strain and I think having a developing brain so close to WiFi radiation (built into wireless headsets) can't be good.There are also some very strange experiences to be had on ""alt space"" and ""VR chat""  there was a 9 yo American child playing cards in VR with adults and the card game had what can only be described as pornographic content written on them.  I spoke with an adult lady next to me and we both agreed this was not a place for children. The whole experience made me very uncomfortable and I left. In this VR world there were posters of pyramids and symbology which seems to be a nod to the occult.Games like ""superhot"" are an intense work out, gone are the days of the motionless gamer hunched on a bean bag, although getting to the next level by holding a virtual gun to your head and committing suicide is not healthy for young minds.As a product it's hard to fault, you are getting a lot for your money. Oculus doesn't recommend this product to anyone under 13yo but I would advise parents to pay close attention to the kind of content and contact their children are having in the virtual world.

I'm a first time VR person so I've nothing to compare it with. I've read other reviews that mention the graphics not being as good a PC based systems but I suppose that's to be expected. £499 (or £399 for 64GB) v over £1000 PC plus headset. In hindsight I would have gone for the 64GB as I won't be playing many of the action games, I'm more of a puzzle/adventure person myself, having said that I'm addicted to the shoot outs in Dead and Buried 2, not so hot at the deathmatches though :(.

And for good reason, I own a Rift, Vive Pro and a Go and this is probably going to replace them all as my main headset. If you're technical enough you can load VRidge and access the SteamVR library which works flawlessly. You can also use bluetooth headphones for a completely wireless experience.The content is just absolutely brilliant. Vader Immortal and Beat Sabre were worth the price alone.Can't recommend enough. If you're looking for a VR headset the 64gb one will probably suffice if you're looking to save a bit of money and grab one but... I can tell you one thing. You won't be dissapointed.

OMG I'm sooo excited about this product. What a fantastic device, absolutely amazing technology. Mind-blowing really. Trouble is, NOWHERE does it say this is a single user device. I mean for the cost of it, my god. It was meant to be a device for the family to share and enjoy, but NO! There is no option to allow multiple users or switch accounts or anything. It is registered to the owner and anyone else using it is represented as them, with no option to change. NO ability to save different players progress in the few games that are available right now. This could easily become a dead turkey. I am really disapointed with this. Had I known beforehand it would definately have changed my decision to purchase. The reality is that my son will play the games and save his progress and the rest of us will simply have to go without or wait for him to complete them. Not cool, no way.Every other device in my household allows multiple users. This is very poor from Oculus. I'm not even going to mention facebook...........

So I got my Quest today, loved the packaging and followed the tutorial to set it up...I loved the setup and the guardian setup, this really does work a treat..Went through the tutorial and then looked at the store, I got my Quest with Vader:Immortal so set about downloading that plus other things...My quest had 46% power from new and after around and hour or hour and a half (showing family) there was a message stating headset power low... so I plugged in the adaptor to the wall and to the Quest, the LED flashed white and I left it for 2 hours (had other things to do).After 2 hours I went back on the Quest only to see 4% battery remaining... Anyone else had this problem?[UPDATED]It turned out to be the USB cable, I tried my USB cable for my Galaxy S8 (with a A-C type adapter) and it charged fine, not going to log a ticket or request a new cable not worth the hassle.Now it's charging this is a really funky devices the games library is growing but has some already amazing games and free content too..If you have a PC you can use a USB cable and connect to your PC, a program called SideQuest (free) has even more content (most free) to make the experience even better.With the new Update 12 you can use the Quest without the controllers, it has full hand tracking (not all games work atm)For me I have the Vader Immortal eps 1-3 which is part of the bundle, as well as Beat Sabre (through Sidequest) I have 40 custom songs and Moss.But through Sidequest I have Lambda1VR (Half-Life), Quake & Quake2 (demo unless you own the games) , High Sea's (navigate a boat on the ocean to the furthest northern region, not as easy as it sounds)

It's fine not great. Sound quality isn't great and worse than the original rift, sound is very important for immersion and this broke it for me, I didn't like having to use my headphones along with this mainly because of comfort. The comfort of the headset is quite bad, all the weight is at the front and even when adjusted properly it's  quite heavy on the head. Also if you want to wear it lightly so it isn't snug then you have to deal with even more light coming from your nose where the headset doesn't block out the environment ruining the immersion further. Even if you do it as tight as possible there is still light bleed from the environment. So turn off your lights? Nope, or the cameras warn they can't track the controllers so there's no real work around for the environmental light bleed from under the nose. Also the field of view could be a little wider, I did sometimes feel like I'm looking through a camera lens rather than actually being in the story. All of this together just ruins the experience for me. It's a decent VR headset and with 6dof it's definitely a step forward, just not as immersive as it could be yet (they really just need to change the comfort level and how it encompasses the face). Also using 3rd party streaming such as ALVR for pc games doesnt work for all games yet if you have a pc VR library, I got it to work with Skyrim but not Superhot etc. Luckily it works with glasses due to the glass spacer but again this isn't comfortable to do and sometimes I'd trade my glasses just for a little bit of comfort which this headset sorely needs.

**In short: This is expensive but worth every single penny.**Things to note: I have been a console gamer for 10 years and been around other gaming aspects for years before that when I was young. I have never owned a PC so have never ran or tried a powerful VR headset. This is my first experience with VR.This headset is absolutely game changing. I’m aware VR headsets before this required a powerful PC (computer) in order to run the software, so you were attached with cables. This requires NO CABLES whatsoever, only a smartphone (iPhone etc) where you install an app and connect via Bluetooth or install and update games and apps on the headset. Once you have installed the games to the headset (hence the GB storage options) you are free to play wherever - literally - and whenever.The app feature is amazing as it allows you to see what the headset sees on your phone - this is perfect when having friends and family test the headset out to point them in the right direction. You can also stream what is seen to a TV for everyone you’re with to see what’s going on.Battery life is very reasonable and depends on the games being played. Apps where you watch videos or just interact with things increase battery life. Immersive games such as shooters, adventures and multiplayers drain the battery quicker. Charging time from 0% takes about 2 -3hours, and gives you maximum approximately 1hour 30mins. When playing alone this is more than enough, as you get worn out from dodging virtual bullets and everything else you can do! Even when showing friends and family the battery is enough to give everyone a few turns at all the popular games.You can download a few free games and plenty of free apps such as Netflix and YouTube. Most games are additional purchase, which I thought was a let down at first but the more you play the more you don’t care as £10-£25 for the top games is totally worth the experience you get out of them. Considering most console games are £50+ it’s saving me a fortune compared to my Xbox!The actual experience itself is hard to put into words. To be inside the games you’re playing is unbelievable. Every single person I’ve had try it out was blown away by how amazing it is. I’d love to be able to describe it more but you just need to try it!

This is true pick up and go VR freedom.  I have not had any previous experience of VR because of the need for a tethered PC which put me off.  I read the pre-reviews for the Quest and based on those pre-ordered and I have to say the experience has been amazing.  The First Steps tutorial is pretty cool and I bought Beat Sabre and enjoyed that.  The 360 VR videos are quite disconcerting if you not experienced them before - high up in the sky or whizzing round on a roller coaster.The killer thing for me is the portability and how quickly you can set up in a location.  I've taken it to work, drawn a boundary in a couple of minutes and let my co-workers have a go!There is a massive novelty factor and it's something that is so easy to share and that sharing really effective as a demonstration of how VR works.  Everyone who's used it has had the same 'wow' reaction.I now need to delve deeper into the games library myself to see the depth of games in comparison to console games.If you can afford it it's a must buy if you have any interest in VR!

I own a Vive and PSVR however the Quest has to be the easiest to use VR kit I own.  It's a very neat piece of gear and being truly wireless without the need to a PC is pretty liberating, I have to say I find myself using the quest a lot more than the other two headsets I own despite the perceived lack of power in comparison, it's just that quick and easy to slip on - you're playing in seconds.  However, even considering that relative lack of power to the other headsets the visuals on the quest are quite remarkable.  Also the audio solution gets top marks from me, very smart and whilst it doesn't perhaps meet the audio fidelity of headphones it is a remarkably ergonomic solution, trust me it's better than fumbling for headphones when you can't see!!  The only negative for me is the comfort, I feel it's the least comfortable headset of the three headsets I own - I'm surprised that Oculus don't seem to have cracked this yet as Sony managed it with PSVR at the first attempt.This is definitely the best attempt so far at producing a VR system for mass consumption, I'd recommend it for anyone curious of what VR is like.

This thing is absolutely insane. It blows my PSVR out of the water, in my opinion. The only thing that lets it down is the relatively short battery life, about 2.5 hours, but to be honest I wouldn't really use it for more than an hour or so anyway, and it charges up quite quickly. (You can always attach a power pack or play while it's plugged in).I'm very, very happy with this amazing new toy.

My boss had an original Rift and I have a Go - I liked the Go, it wasn't bad for the money, not as graphically amazing as the Rift but I could watch a 3D movie or I could play a game and it was fine. Wasn't the most comfortable thing you could have on your head, but it was what it was.So it was quite nice to see the devices getting a bit of an upgrade - the Rift S still had the cables, but better optics and the Quest was essentially the same, better optics than the Go, better hardware than the Go.What made me buy the Quest was the promise of the Link feature (coming in October apparently) which allows you to, via a USB-C cable, attach to a PC and experience Rift games without having to get a second headset. Yep - one headset to rule them all.......maybe. We shall see on that score (but early tests have been positive).So I grabbed a Quest. It's a LOT more comfortable than the Go and you can adjust the lenses for pupilary distance - which is welcome. I'd argue it's a bit more solid too and the one thing I really appreciated - my prescription Go lenses fitted too! So, while you can wear glasses (again more comfy than the Go) you can also use the same prescription lenses (which I classify as a RESULT).The interface is the same as before - a bit slicker and as many people mention, you get to draw your boundary so that you don't walk into the wall, fall over a chair or worse and then you are basically set. I would say that you definitely feel it is more responsive than the Go even just at this point and the display is definitely noticeably a step up.I haven't bought any games as yet and that's criticism one - you can't port any purchases across, even DLC such as the Extreme Roller Coasters, being forced to buy again. Which I'm not impressed with but ok, I get it, they look much better blah blah. The second major criticism is the cost of the games. A major increase over Go content and I'm not sure if some games are worth the price (such as Rush being nearly three times what the Go version is cost wise). Maybe they'll come down.However I purchased it mostly for the Rift potential - so, as a bit of hardware, it's really nice and I think worth the cash (especially as you can have the portability too). But I think the store is a tad overpriced at the moment. I'm sure others will disagree with me - but hey, that's fine.  For now, Avengers Endgame 3D on a HUGE screen is beckoning me back.......

This device will be heralded as paradigm shift from enthusiast VR into mainstream and mass scale casual adoption.Portability, power and true immersion for a very fair price point, it is incredibly impressive.Outside of the hardware itself there are very passionate software developers working tirelessly to bring their product to the Quest natively, without skimping on quality.Already there are enthusiasts sideloading emulated software and games as well as PC streaming services, essentially allowing the Quest to become a Rift or Vive with the full power of a PC behind it, wirelessly over wifi and we're still only in the first week of release!Once enough resourceful developers exploit the full potential of this device, we will be entering into a brave new world of gaming, social interaction and virtual exploration.From meeting strangers in a virtual playground, sharing a movie between friends or lovers across the world, or allowing the elderly or infirmed to travel beyond the limits of their bodies with a full and real sense of presence, the Oculus Quest is a world changer.Positional body and controller tracking is excellent and the screen is crystal clear, though minor screen door effect is noticeable, with god rays pouring though when viewing a bright source of light within a dark scene.Minor gripes on release though must be mentioned. The native audio is lacking and while the open air sound is immersive while still allowing awareness of the outside, it doesn't drive lower frequencies very well and bass is lost on experiences which rely on music, though obviously this can be remedied with external headphones (there are two 3.5mm jacks)Another issue seems to be temperamental charging, from not recognising that it is plugged in or charging, to showing a charging indicator and not charging, to seemingly charging indefinitely while at 100% and not showing a fully charged light. These issues can usually be addressed by a hard shut down and restart though and are minor in the grand scheme.Finally this is more of a suggestion for a use case: in pure darkness the device obviously cannot make use of visual tracking for the full 6 degrees of freedom, but it would be handy to be able to switch between 6dof and 3dof (Oculus GO style) for these times, such as being able to watch a movie in bed, in the dark.

My main issue with the Quest is Oculus seem to have decided this is their Games system, and not to be providing assorted VR and Media apps on it, which are available on the GO. So anyone buying this, as it has a better spec than the GO, is likely to be disappointed when they find it isn't an upgrade, but a more limited option.Also you can see the pixels when using it, resolutions don't seem to be quite there yet.The controllers are fun (although eat batteries when not being used - rechargeables, with spares, are your friend) and the system software is generally slick.

Bought many a games console, but this is next level. Was always a little disappointed with the games industry which seemed to favor just jacking up resolution and making graphics more realistic rather than focusing on experiences. Which really only benefited the ""triforce of silicon"" i.e. Nvidia, AMD and Intel.Oculus/Facebook got this perfect. I've literally no complaints about the Quest and every time I share the Quest with friends and family they all love it. I mean love it.They love Beat Saber, Star Wars, Angry Birds and watching movies on the moon or a space station. Doing a spacewalk around the ISS or swimming with the sharks. I love Oculus Link and getting to play games on SteamVR and Oculus Rift platforms. Which lets me play awesome titles like Lone Echo or Elite Dangerous. And soon.... Half-life Alyx!!!!!! (whoop)My 4 year old daughter loves ""shooting chickens at the annoying green piggies"" and my wife loves watching movies/tv series in Netflix and Prime apps. I've even used this on a recent long haul between the USA and UK and it worked great.If you aren't excited about getting this or don't think it's for you, then we can't be friends...

The hardware does not seem capable of keeping up with the software. I experienced annoying ""stutter"" and ""hitches"" at regular intervals during game play. The Vader Immortal games which came free with the device played like garbage and were clearly far too demanding for it. I experienced slow downs and stutter in nearly all the titles I tested outside of the Beat Saber demo. To be honest, I couldn't demo the unit to anyone due to how poorly it performed.I also had comfort issues with the product and found the rear ''craddle"" part of the headstrap dug into my skull and became painful after a short time of use. The front foam was also unpleasent, too firm, and dug into my cheeks. I would class myself as a 'heavy VR  user', using HMDs of one type or another most days, this device was by far the most uncomfortable I have used and no amount of adjustment seemed to fix that. I read that many users seek third party 'solutions' to resolve the comfort problems, this is something I would have been willing to explore if it were not for the performance issues I noticed.Based on both of the issues I encountered I cannot recommend this product and have returned my unit to Amazon.

We owned a PSVR, that we sold about 6 months ago. Loved it but Poor tracking, clunky set up, and lack of any updates to the move controllers were the key reason I moved on from it, had fully intended on buying a Rift until this was announced. I am pleased to say we were not dissapointed, the visuals are crisp, text appears sharp far more so then the PSVR. Graphics were actually pretty impressive , I had doubts after seeing a number of videos before launch, but I am happy to report that in the headset I have yet to be dissapointed with a game.Its really easy to set up, i've moved from living room to kitchen, to stationary in the bedroom and its less then a minute to get going in a new location. Watching movies on the Netflix app is actually a pretty decent and an enjoyable experience.On the negative side, its a little front heavy and casting your screen(ability to let others view what the player is seeing) to a device seemed a bit flaky, it kept dropping connection or quality was unwatchable.

I spent a long time considering buying this as was very skeptical of the overwealming positive reviews. I also previously had used Google Daydream with my pixel 2XL phone so wasn't expecting a big difference from that because it uses the same processor inside. I can safely say this is by far the most wow factor tech purchase I've ever made to date.Firstly the Oculus Quest is substantially better than Google Daydream. No messing about trying to put a phone inside the mask, vastly more games, better quality, and most importantly of course the room tracking that Quest can do makes you feel that you are IN the world..not just viewing it from a lens. It's extremely convincing.  On rollercoaster VR games, you can feel the drops in your stomach even though you are not really moving. In short films and games, you are looking at buildings and characters to scale so you get a full appreciation of how big or small things are in real life and you can walk up to them, and around them. You won't stop smiling and will want to show everyone when you own this. And the sound quality from this is very clever and rarely mentioned..it gives the illusion of surround sound into your ears without having to wear headphones and it's a decent volume and quality similar to a small smart speaker. As you turn your head, the audio will shift to enhance the VR surround experience.A few people mention the weight in the face of the mask. If the straps are adjusted properly by pulling them backwards from the mask then pulling the straps down over your head properly it's not uncomfortable and can be worn easily while wearing glasses at the same time if like me, you wear glasses, without any additional light spill. (The quest comes with a special attachment for people that wear glasses)There is a small amount of light spill from the bottom of the mask, but the brightness of the VR overrides it so you won't notice it when it's running.And of course being Amazon, if it's not for you, you can post it back easily, but honestly if you are considering this by reading the reviews I say don't hesitate. You won't regret it. (The 64gb version is more than enough for storage. Most games are around 500mb)

I've been keen on the idea of VR for some time but have held off of buying until now.  I've tried them from the original Oculus Alpha kit (that a fellow dev I worked with owned) to an Oculus launch unit, a Vive and PSVR.  With all of them I've found various reasons not to take the plunge, whether that be cost, weight, tracking issues, or the sheer number of cables that are needed and the difficulty of setting up a space for it.Having read the reviews and watched videos of the Quest I was sure they had finally come up with a system that is ideal for me.  This is a standalone unit that only needs it's included USB C cable for charging (though there is soon to be some new software called Oculus Link that will allow you to connect this to your PC via a USB 3.1 connection and play full PC VR games on it should you have a PC that's beefy enough (another thing that drew me into buying it).The only extra bit of kit you need for this is an iPhone or Android that can run the Oculus app.  This app is used to configure the unit , connect it to home your home wifi and get started.  You can also use it to make purchases, though you can also do this inside the Oculus.The unit comes with the VR Headset , USB Cable, Plug and 2 Touch Controllers.Set-up is very easy indeed, the app and then the Quest step you through the whole thing and then give you a very easy tutorial into how to use the touch controllers.  It also as an outward facing camera, used for both tracking but also used to set-up your play space.  You use the touch controller to draw out a safe ""Guardian Zone"" on the floor, this being a safe play space where you can't fall over or hit anything.  From here the game draws a cage around you and then creates the game world.  If you step outside of the bounds of this zone then the camera turns on and allows you to see the outside world.From there you download your software and get playing.  Thus far I have downloaded a number of apps inc Netflix and Amazon (movies in VR, very cool), YouTube (which has some excellent 360 degree VR movies) , the very amusing VR chat and also a number of game demos including the marvellous Beat Sabre and Superhot.I have to say I am blown away by it.  Considering it's power is equivalent to a Pixel Phone (until connected to a PC), it is extremely smooth and the games look great (though of course not high end PC VR great but thus far it seems like the most fun VR experiences are more about the experience than high end visual fidelity.  Tracking is extremely smooth and accurate, making the games a joy to play and the touch controllers are extremely accurate.  I feel like the tech has all come together here to finally deliver a full 6 degrees of freedom experience without the previous limitations.  It's also so nice not to have a system where tracking keeps drifting and needing resetting.  This one just works.Overall I'm delighted with this, for those who've been waiting to jump into VR I feel this really is the time.  It's an excellent bit of kit.

I had tried out a friends Oculus Rift a while ago, which was pretty amazing, but the idea of a complicated PC set-up put me off getting that. This seemed like the perfect compromise, and I am so glad I did. It is very easy to set-up and use, no need to worry about plugging in sensors and various cables. It is portable, so you can use this anywhere!I've tried out various apps, the Netflix one is surprisingly really good. There are a lot of social elements too, you can walk around cinemas and chat with people and watch films together, and the games are amazing.

I'm an so glad I decided to take a chance and purchase the Quest. Best bit of kit I have bought in a long time. Sure the rift can play games with better graphics but you need an expensive pc to tether yourself too, restricting movement. The Quest eliminates the need for a PC. Being completely free to play VR and move without tripping over wires is the dream. Superhot untethered makes you feel like a bad ass action hero.I was completly blown away when I first turned it on and entered th VR world. I was totally immersed. The guardian wall is genius. You basically paint or your safe area on the floor and it creates a grid wall. The wall will appear to alert you that you need to move back.As you can also store all your games on the headset, it makes it perfect for taking it out the house, be it a holiday or friends house.It feels sturdy and well made. WIth care of all last a long time.QUEST have just added full hand and finger tracking, can't wait for developers to use this on games.There is also the new Link cable which you can attach to a Pc to play Rift games on the quest headset.Finally a headset for the masses.Buy it!

This headset is great, and probably the best one around, allowing standalone wireless use, as well as PC connectivity. However, I don't recommend it unless you have loads of money and you don't care about the price. This headset would totally be worth it for £200, but £500 is way too much. Here's why:CONS:The number of games is very limited, especially without connecting it to your PC to use with steam (which will require you to pay ~£20 extra for a cable)The games are generally very expensive, and few of them have a lot of replayability. You also cannot trial them on the Oculus store, like you can on steam.The resolution of the screen, while among the highest available, is not good enough yet. It is so close to your eyes you can clearly see the pixels and the gaps between them and it isn't great for your immersion.This screen I believe has around 60-80Hz refresh rate. It does okay, but like the resolution, requires improvement.If you use glasses, the glasses spacer is not good enough. You will feel constantly anxious about your glasses scratching the lenses. You can buy a prescription lens online from somewhere like VRopticians, but that'll set you back an additional £60 or so (they work great though).The controllers seem to drain the batteries even when the headset is not in use. I have to take the batteries out of them every time i put it away so i don't need new batteries every time.PROS:This is the best standalone headset so, it is definitely the best for watching adult content (which i recommend).It's also good for just watching netflix. The amazon prime app isn't as good, but watching content in general is good with this headset.Beatsaber is a good game. Buy it. Also get custom songs ;)cba to write anymore

High quality VR that works with or without a PC. Cordless six degrees of freedom for a great price. Easy setup uses augmented reality. There are no external sensors or base stations etc to complicate things and incur more cost.With the Link cable accessory you can play Rift and Steam games. This also enables cross-platform play with Steam and Rift. Some games are cross-buy so you get a copy for the Rift too (and vice versa).Compared to the Rift CV1 there is less screen door effect and mura. The resolution is even higher than the Rift S.Importantly, there is an interpupillary distance switch and also an insert for glasses wearers.What's not so good? they are widely considered to be uncomfortable even when adjusted correctly. They weigh only 100g more than the Rift CV1 (about the same as the Rift S and HTC Vive) but are front heavy and use a similar headstrap to the CV1. I found that to get them to stay put I had to wear them too tight. The face pad is just too firm. The good news is that this is easily remedied by adding a counterweight to the back strap. We use a small [camera lens] pouch with Velcro and D-ring attachment points and stuff it with spare controller batteries. With a counterweight you can just pop it on without making lots of adjustments.The 1440x1600 resolution is as good as the Vive Pro and Index but understandably things don't look as pretty as with a dedicated PC headset. The screen refresh rate and field of view are not the best out there either.The official Link cable will set you back £79.A new version is on the horizon but all in all a great headset because of its low cost and feature-rich performance. Mainstream VR right now in these uncertain times.

As most other reviews have pointed out the Quest is a fantastic VR headset. My experience however has been soured by Stuck/Dead Pixels having now had to return my second Quest to Amazon for the same issue.I also owned Vive Pro, Oculus CV1, Oculus Rift S, PSVR and this is the first headset I've had any Dead/Stuck pixels and now it's been on 2 separate units.Make sure you check your screens against dark backgrounds. I found it easiest to watch YouTube in fullscreen using the Oculus Browser then turn around and stare into the blackness. I had a few Stuck/Dead pixels on my first unit on the right OLED screen and now I have a few Stuck/Dead on the left OLED screen on this new unit.The /r/OculusQuest subreddit is also reporting lots of the same issue.Hopefully I can get a replacement soon as it destroys the immersion when something dark is happening on screen and there's bright green dots.Update: Managed to get a third unit and this one so far touch wood seems to have 0 issues. Hopefully I was just really unclucky with the first two.

I was a it late to the party when it comes to the Quest and there have been may updates to the device since its initial release. The quest works brilliantly as a stand-alone VR device and the people I have shown it to have all had a smile brought to their face by how impressive this VR device can be.It has a brilliant Unboxing experience (if that is important to you) and screams premium product. The headset is of brilliant build quality and the fresnel lenses provides a great image once you accept the slight ghosting/glare that is produced by this technology. The headset is rather front heavy and there are a number of ways people have found online to allow for longer play sessions without the excess pressure on the face. I have attached some additional cushioning and headband from AMVR which work well for my needs. Unfortunately, you would need to factor the cost of these extras into the experience, on top of a carry case if you require one; it would have been nice to see this included given the cost of the device and its main marketing point being that it can be played anywhere. Battery life is decent and it charges fully very quickly.The controllers feel natural to hold and they make stepping into a new game feel quite intuitive. They require a AA battery each, so I reccomend carrying a spare set around if you are traveling with this (rechargable may be a good investment). One of the most recent updates allows for controlling the device with just your hands (without the controllers) which is even more immersive and makes the future of VR look even more interesting.The device can also be used with an appropriate cable, as a PC tethered headset in the place of something like an Oculus Rift or Valve index. This opens up its versatility even more, as some of the better/larger VR experiences were previously out of reach of the Quest due to hardware limitations. At the time of writing, this appears to be the better value headset on the market due to its ability to perform both tethered and mobile.The games can be purchased through the oculus Quest store, either in the headset itself or via the mobile app (if bought on the mobile app, remember to then find the game from inside the headset to download it). If you do tether to PC, games can also be purchased on the Rift store, but not all are 'cross buy' enabled. This means that you can buy a game on the Rift store and, unless it expressly says you can play on the Quest, will always be required to be attached to the PC to play (and the reverse is also true). This can get confusing as the same game can be on sale on the Quest store but full price on the Rift store, so make sure you check both. It also works fine with the likes of Steam VR, which opens up options for where you buy your gamesI was unaware of just how far VR has come at this point, and while by no means perfect at all times, I really do reccomend this device to anyone who has waited until now to try out VR for the first time.

OMFG, best VR experience I've had so far.I've tried PSVR, WMR and the Oculus Quest is the best so far.If you haven't tried VR yet, get this, it will blow your mind. You can literally play anywhere, it's wonderful.The headset sits a little funny on my head, and I'd rather see the halo style on this. But begger's can't be choosers.It comes with the ability to wear glasses with it. Though I'll be investing in prescription lenses for the headset. Yes, those exist :DHonestly, if you want to experience VR, and aren't picky on your choice of games, get this.And the way the controls work, the grip button is such a good idea, takes a little getting used to, but once you do, they're so easy to use.Some of the games I've played:Superhot VROne of the best games to play with this headset. So much freedom of movement, makes you wonder if it's really a game you're playing :DBeat SaberWith a short video tutorial, you can play with mods on the Quest too. Which blows the game open with so many more features and songs :DThat's all I've been playing on it, well that and streaming over WiFi from my PC to play even more VR games.If it wasn't so hot lately I'd be playing it all the time.

Absolutely Amazing... Coming from the Oculus Rift with my PC, sensors, cables, extension cables, sensor issues, Windows updates to this.... Where you press on and put it on and your playing in seconds.  Optics are way better than the rift, resolution is noticeably better. Tracking is better than the rift, no idea how, but it's better.  Look through camera is genius. Sound is good, headphones would be better. Came charged to 60%, so ready to play. Super Hot VR was meant to be played without wires.. Vader immortal.. this is PC VR quality, amazing experience. I did have 2 times where a game crashed out, not sure what caused it. Minor teething issue. This is the first real pick up and play VR exoerienxe, for everyone. No PC required.

Well what can I say about the oculus quest that hasn’t been said already. The gaming experience is unreal!! It doesn’t pack state of the art graphics like an Xbox X however the graphics are more then plenty for hours and hours of fun and enjoyment. Battery life is pretty short at around 2-3 hours depending on how demanding your usage but I’m for how much the quest actually does I think that’s amazing battery life.Games are responsibly priced with average costing £10-£15 although some of the higher end games come in more £25-£30 price range.As weird as it is to talk about the packaging it was very well packed and attention had been paid to the little details Giving an instant feeling of a high end product and the headset actually came with enough charge to set up and play a demo.Fantastic product and a great way to get into VR gaming/experiences. Worth every penny I paid and both myself and my wife have throughly enjoyed playing on it. Fantastic family fun and value for money.

I originally purchased the samsung Galaxy Gear VR which was tons of fun- but limited to only watch8ng demos. My nextvVR experience was playing Space Pirate Trainer on a HTC Vive. So being able to duplicate the experience on a machine a fraction of the price was appealing and it didn't disappoint, so I decided to take a leap of faith and give the Quest a go.The packaging is luxurious- better than a Tag Watch and the build quality of the Quest is nothing short of exceptional. It's not cheap or thrown together - it's far better than any Sony VR headset and to be very clear, itviscjot at all heavy at the front. The fact that productveven exists - at this price (I paid £499 for thec128gb version) is astonishing. So what's it like to use?Nothing will prepare you for the experience with the Quest. The twin displays are excellent for what the technology can deliver. The audio is very rich and clear, and you dont need to purchase additional earphones - unless you want some privacy.  The headset is very comfortable and the controllers are well thought through. I would advise on buying some third party straps so they are secure for very active gaming.Loving space stuff I purchased the full copy of Space Pirate Trainer which will give you a proper workout and countless hours of fun. I also purchased Vader Immortsl 1 and 2c- MUST PURCHASE. In fact this  game is so good, you'll never need to visit Disneyland to go on a fancy ride - you can do it all on Quest. I spend 30 mins killing 8 feet tall robots and mr clothes were wringing wet with the excitement and action - seriously it really is THAT GOOD.I think a strong point is he ability to visit people's homes and let my friends and colleagues have a go with Quest and watching everyone enjoy the experience.I would also recommend downloading the Amazon prime app where you can enjoy watching a movie in your own cinema. I have purchased some moviee in HD and its amazing. Just like being at my local Odeon.If you can afford to purchase a Quest, you wont be disappointed. It REALLY IS THAT GOOD.

First off, it looks well made and well designed. A little heavy but that's to be expected for a device that contains so many components including a rechargeable battery.  However, it can get to be a little uncomfortable after a while. Video and game definition is good but if, like me, you wear glasses they will fog up a bit after a time  and you will lose definition a little. There is also the problem of reflection from your glasses in the lens of the headset. Fairly obvious when starting the headset or when the background is very dark. You can have custom lenses that fit over the headset lenses made from your glasses prescription to save you wearing your specs  but they're not cheap! The range of games and apps is pretty good with new ones in the pipeline but if you like a bit of variety some of the games aren't cheap and it will get to be a bit expensive. The dual controllers open up a new world in VR and act as a pair of on screen hands in some apps and games which gives them a new interest. You can also put the controllers down and use your hands to control some basic functions like searching and scrolling etc.  A fair amount of free stuff and lots of free demos to download. Very easy to set up and the phone app is excellent. My only criticism is that the device has a ""Guardian"" system that prevents you from moving about other than an area that you can define or you can select stationary but the space then is very limited. You can turn Guardian mode off but you have to google to find out how, which involves jumping through a few hoops but on the plus side. leaving it on will prevent you from tripping over the dog or head butting the wall.Overall, it's a pretty good device that can give you many hours of fun and entertainment with a reasonable battery life. Whether its worth the high price remains to be seen as its developed in the future. Certainly an improvement on those games devices that have to be connected to a PC.

I was dubious when daughter asked for this but what a great device it is!The device is a tad heavy when on, but manageable and plan on fitting a battery pack /counter weight for extended gameplay and better balance.The visual quality is fine considering everything is integrated into the headset and the sound is great and, as there are no headphones, you are still aware of what's going on around you (but can wear headset fine if you want total immersion). Battery life seems good (around 3 hours so far).With regards to games, Beat sabre an big hit with the whole family.... Fun, intuitive and as challenging you want it to be.Highly recommend the platformer Moss..... Visually gorgeous and with engaging and challenging gameplay - you actually care about the little mouse.All in all, this sceptic has been converted.

I have owned an Oculus Rift CV1 since 2016 and as soon as the option to use a Link cable was mentioned at OC6 I ordered the quest. Being used to VR a lot of my first impressions were not as WOW as some other reviewers, although I was super impressed with the quality of the screens and the graphics from what is a mobile chipset, plus being tetherless is amazing, I took the headset to work and used it in a sports hall and played room sized games, fantastic!.Pro'sEasy to pick up and playIn built speakers are very good for their size (much better than I had expected after reading initial reviews)Tracking is excellentUI is very goodNo tetherScreens and lenses are very clearCan stream PC games wirelessly through Virtual DesktopWill be able to connect to my PC via a link cable sometime in November replacing my CV1.ConsSlightly front heavy, but I fixed this by adding a small counterweight battery to the back of the head strap.Set up through the App wasn't as straightforward as it should be, really struggled to connect to my iPhone.Games are generally short experiences and at time of writing don't have sales on the Oculus store.All in all really happy with my purchase, as soon as the link option is released and I check it works well I will sell my Rift and use this as my main head set.

Excellent bit of kit. When my son asked for it, I had no idea what it was. Once it arrived we had a go. We didn’t have games yet, so we played the demos.  I laughed my head off watching my son play, then it was my turn. As an avid gamer using a Sony/Xbox controller, I found it a bit strange yet fascinating to find my rifle on my chest, knife on my shoulder, pistol on my hip. What I’m trying to say, I finally understood what my son got out of the game. For as outstanding as this system is, there are things to be aware of. Firstly, the hand held controllers aren’t rechargeable. And we found once supplied, batteries only last three hours. Second, although the system has a guardian mode so you can outline your play area. And it can be played mobile or stationary. The company recommends some movement. So I recommend playing in a room with a good deal of free space to move about. I rode the rollercoaster stationary and found myself nauseous once it finished. Same with the call of duty style game. Other then those two things I think it was a good purchase!

Amazing headset and best value for money. It works well as a standalone and is easily mobile with a case. Initial setup is easy and extremely interesting to watch the startup as a newbie to vr. Setting it up in a new location such as a friend's house is extremely easy and doesn't even take a minute so you can play on the go and you can replay the tutorials if anyone else wants a go. It runs games very well with no stutters. The Oculus Link is also very good as it allows you to use your Quest like any other vr headset by running games from the pc through the headset.A quick tip would be that if you're just going to use the quest as a standalone headset it's only worth getting the 64 GB version, but if you're going to use external downloads such as Pavlov or side quest then i suggest getting the 128 GB.Even after having this headset for months it is still running extremely well, even after being modded.Overall this is an amazing headset at a great price!

Absolutely Brilliant, coming from using PSVR, I was expecting quite a downgrade in graphics, but after playing Vader Immortal parts 1-3 was blown away by how good it looks, and not being tethered just adds so much more to the experience, and can play steam/oculas rift games on my gaming laptop wirelessly/untethered using Virtual Desktop is pretty damn good, love it.Thought can get a bit uncomfortable after prolonged use, though you can charge and play, but I use that charging time to take a rest, as I prefer it untethered, and the battery life is around 2 hours, 1x AA battery is needed for each controller which last around 2 weeks, so I'll need to get some chargeable batteries and a charger,

The Oculus Go was my first foray into the world of VR. That was and still is awesome. I love how you can look down to your right (or left if you have configured it that way) and 'see' your controller. The Oculus Go is for entertainment and it does an amazing job for those of us who do not want to be tethered to a PC. Now for the Oculus Quest.The Oculus Quest takes the awesomeness of the Oculus Go and cranks it up to 11!Upon first putting on the headset, I had put the controllers down on the couch next to me. I looked over and 'saw' them. The Quest sees where they are physically and represents them in VR exactly. I could reach over and pick them up without having to remove the headset. I found that quite impressive. Next, your virtual hands are expertly represented in VR and you are able to pick things up, manipulate and throw them. You can even catch things you have thrown in the air! I haven't even discussed the games yet. There will be many reviews discussing the games so I'm just reviewing the overall experience.The device is a powerful machine and feels very intuitive to use. You are totally immersed in the virtual world. Highly recommended.

I had a problem with the Oculus Quest VR headset which stopped working after only 6 months. During discussion with the Amazon support team, I repeatedly advised that I did not want them to process a return or a refund as I was at that time in discussion with Oculus support to get the problems resolved. At the time, it was also impossible to buy another Oculus in the UK, so what I really wanted was a replacement. I was merely enquiring with Amazon what my options were if Oculus could not resolve the problem. Oculus did manage to resolve the problem and sent me a replacement, and I sent back the original unit to them. However Amazon for some strange reason also sent me a refund as well. Unfortunately, I was unable to make contact with Amazon through their diabolical automated system to discuss this matter further, or to refund their refund, and their chat support people did not comprehend the issue the first time round. So 4 months later, they are finally interested in getting their money back. Good job I didn't book a holiday!

I bought this a few weeks before the upgraded version came out. It is brilliant. I wish there was more in the educational area as I am an older male (58) and gaming is not really my thing. I just love the animations made by quill VR programme. The artists using it are seriously talented. I have brought through to my room a chair which can swivel so I can enjoy the 360 degree animations as I was fed up hurting my neck trying to keep turning around. I wear glasses and missed the guidance on installing the frame you can insert to create extra space. Everything was blurred for a few sessions until the penny dropped. The device is a bit heavy on the bridge of the nose and it feels as it is is slipping off my head, but it has not done so so far. Given the lack of opportunities to travel this is the time for everybody to start making programmes in 360 degrees / 3D / 4K on museums, architecture, tours of cities and beaches,. I have a daughter at high school and would love apps on learning a language, chemistry, biology, maths. It is limitless if somebody could do the app. The educational opportunities are stunning. I see they have a lot for the Oculus Go but hardly anything for the quest at the moment. The images are stunning. I bought headphones as my Bluetooth ones are unable to connect. They have to be jack to plug into the oculus. It is a set as there is a jack for each ear to get stereo. I am away to play the Dr. Who game whilst I wait for the educational stuff to start arriving.

WOW - Hubbie has been looking to get a VR headset since Christmas and this is the one that he kept going back to over and over again. He loves the fact it is all wireless and it doesn't need a spec-ed up PC to run it from. It was super easy to set up using the app on iphone and the headset. He's not a massive gamer as  gets confused about all the different X this button and Y this button to create moves so wanted something that was simple. The training  straight form word go on how to use the hand gestures to pick things up and shoot was great fun and simple that the whole family has picked it up in no time. The only problem we have found is that it rubs his forehead a bit (he does play it for hours on end though!!) so will invest in a balancing power pack at some point.

So... I don't really want to slate this product as it is excellent and the technology behind this whole VR system is amazing but I just didn't fall in love with it for a few reasons.Once you buy this headset, it is YOURS, it's linked to YOUR account. Yes, you can let other people have a try and there are 'party' modes for certain games but it is very much a one-player system. What I mean by that is, if you want to play a game, for instance, SUPERHOT, only you can progress through the game. You don't get to start a separate game for someone else. I just found that a bit poor given the cost of the system.Another reason I wasn't a huge fan was because I still find VR a bit gimmicky. I bought this and had it on the 23rd December to use over the Xmas period with family. It was a great laugh giving everyone a go and everyone enjoyed it. However, when the festivities were over and it was just me with the headset, I only used it a few times and never really had an urge to play it. I actually had more of a desire to play the PS4 instead.I don't know, maybe it was just me but I still think VR is a good few years away from being what I want it to be. I'm waiting until we get 'Ready Player One' levels of VR available!Great system but got bored far too easily.

Overall the VR experience is very good,  I would say one of the best on the market, and although it pales in comparison with my friend's Valve Index, it's less than half the price, allows multi-room setup and is mobile and untethered, although the smooth PC Wireless mode is possible only if your PC has a wired connection.I didn't find any need for a 128 Gb though and now I think it would've been a good thing to buy the 64Gb version instead, provided most of the games I use are actually the PC titles.BeatSaber and Vader Immortal are the only standalones that work for me. The mobile graphics quality is no substitute for the gaming rig, alas.But with all of your Steam titles available wirelessly with a small modification of Virtual Desktop or wired with an Oculus Link cable (sold separately), you could play your PC titles and feel no perceptible lag in most games (I recommend a standalone or Link-ed BeatSaber though as the reaction times are very small there)

There is a problem with charging, you see the quest won't charge at 43 degrees, so the quest must be left in sleep mode for about 15 minutes then you can plug the charger in. The quest will not charge whilst it's off after the first set up. This is not a fault but a design. Now I've told you what I wish I knew I'll begin the review. The oculus quest has so many things it can do, you can play simple vr games in the oculus browser and even look at 3D images. The actual store games are immersive and time whizzes by whilst playing them. Right from the start up the oculus quest never fails to amaze. This is the real virtual reality deal. As more time is spent with the oculus quest I find new entertaining things it can do. If you do sink the money on the oculus quest you won't regret it. You have to see the size of the screen on the YouTube 360 app, your t.v will look tiny. I in no way regret spending such a huge amount of money on the oculus quest.

Very impressed with this headset. I've been a user of PSVR for over a year and while I love that system the feeling of freedom using this set is a breath of fresh air. I've only played the demos so far but they all run extremely smoothly and the screen is crisp and clear. Having manual IPD control is also a really nice touch. Everything about this device feels premium. My only slight gripe is that there aren't many games available at launch and as such you won't find any games on sale like you would for the Rift or PSVR.

I've been around the block with gaming systems since Atari, NES, SNES, Playstation, XBOX etc. These systems when first released all blew me away... playing Ocarina of Time (Zelda) on the Gamecube  on release with my mouth wide open.I knew what VR was like of course but to have this in your home in fantastic. I'm sure there will be more expensive options out there and better quality if you pair them with £2000 PC's.

I questioned the need of head phones, I didn't know the audio played from the headset,but only you can hear it.Only downside is that the head strap seems to sit too rigidly and the cushions press hard into your cheek.

The Oculus Quest was an expensive purchase but what an over the top popular gift it was! The 12 year old the recipient of said gift allowed the rest of us a nano second of time to try it out. By the New Year Celebrations I was wishing we were selling the Oculus Quest because we would have made a fortune. The Uncles and Aunts  were trying it out and hitting the Amazon site to try and get one . Overall a great gift.

The Quest is incredible! Having tried a few VR systems most notably the PSVR and Rift, the Quest is the most well rounded and great value for money on of the lot! Sleek design, fits great and is pretty comfy if a tiny bit heavy (but lighter than some VRs so). The resolution is fantastic beating botht he Rift and PSVR, it can't quite compete with say the Valve Index in graphics but it is also £700 cheaper. Most people won't really care unless you are already deeply into VR. One thing to note though, as this is an all in one headset it will run Beat Saber/Superhot/Pistol Whip etc. Fantastically but it can't cope with huge open world games like No Man's Sky or Skyrim VR etc. There is a way around this as you can buy a cable to plug it into your PC and turn it into a PC VR set able to run anything. You will need a beefy PC to do this though! Just bare that in mind. :) All in all 10/10 for me!

I bought the original Oculus Rift when it first came out, then bought the Touch controllers - that was about 3 years ago!  Now I've bought the 128Gb Quest and it is the BEST gaming system that I've ever tried.  Sure the graphics are not as fancy as proper Rift, but it is VERY close indeed.  Not having wires means that you can play anywhere you please (or watch favourite Netflix movies!).  Would massively recommend anyone getting this!

UPDATE: the Quest has been out for a year and a half now and its currently discontinued as a replacment launches next month. and for the Quest, the last year has been... boring. very very little in the way of content. a year later and ive downloaded 4 more games, none of which last longer than an hour, none of which are particularly exciting. Moss, Vader Imortal and beat saber are the only titles id bother with. i primarily use my quest as a home cinema screen. disappointing, the quest was an impressive bit of kit but without content it failed to fulfil its potential.VR has really stepped up a notch, to provide the quality of visuals in such a small, lightweight device WITHOUT tethering it to a PC is indredible. id agree its pricey, until you see what this is capable of, then id have to say it actual priced very fairly. Ive downloaded a few titles so far, Moss and Vader Immortal both being stand outs at the moment. the games still feel a little limited compared to whats available on current generation consoles, but they come in at a much lower price tag then anything on the PS4 for example. i think the Quest is really waiting on some big name studios to prduce high end titles but its on the verge of being a something very very special.

The quest is expensive, however once I started the tutorial, I could not believe what I was seeing.  I felt like a kid again, I’m now 50.  If you have the money to buy this.... do it.  The games are great, you won’t get top graphics, but that doesn’t matter.  The experience of being inside a game is strange but brilliant.  I highly recommend this, it is a very active experience, the boxing game had me puffed out in the first round. If you like the game “super hot”on consoles, then this on the quest will blow you away.Join the questers!

Works well. Good tech. Stylish. Easy to use. Great hand controllers. Competitively priced. Good graphics and simulation. Comfortable to wear at first but hurts and leaves marks on face after 30 mins of use though which is a shame. The console is in the visor to give freedom so unavoidable. Son has played lots of games on it. In app game purchases. Like that you can cast to phone or smart TV for others to watch what your doing. Makes it more sociable. Remove any breakables as can easily get lost in the vr world and accidentally punch walls. Read the safety instructions, set peramiters and supervise children. Good fun.

Facebook are selling Quests as fast as they can make them for a good reason; this is the most accessible and immersive VR experience money can buy right now.Pros- The Oculus Insight tracking system works like magic. The four cameras on the front of the headset track your position in physical space and your Touch Controllers incredibly well.- The Oculus Store is booming right now with some truly fantastic games such as Beat Saber, Tetris Effect, The Climb, Arizona Sunshine, Vader Immortal and Gun Club VR. The future looks very bright with the developers of Boneworks and The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners working on Quest titles for later this year, not to mention Phantom: Covert Ops coming next month.- The Touch Controllers themselves are one of the best handheld controller systems I've ever used. The hardware almost disappears because they fit into your hand so well.- My Quest is a completely different device to the one I bought last year because of relentless improvements from Oculus which seem to be non-stop; it now supports (very impressive) hand tracking, can run PCVR games with Oculus Link and has had a home screen UI redesign which is far superior to the original (amongst other minor improvements such as Virtual Environments, experimental features and Insight tracking improvements)- The immersion you feel in 6 degree of freedom VR done well (as it is here) really is a completely new kind of digital experience and it is very compelling. I still stop in awe at times when picking up a virtual object or sharing (what feels like) a physical space with someone on the other side of the world in Oculus Venues.Cons- This is (understandably) a fairly heavy device. After about 30 minutes I often to feel some discomfort and usually limit my play sessions to 1-1.5 hours max, mainly due to the device pressing on my face. You can make your own ""comfort mod"" with a counterweight on the back of the device, however this hasn't increased the comfort for me so much so that the weight ceases to be an issue.- The controller low battery alert system is just totally broken for me; I use rechargeable batteries and simply do not get any notifications when they're running low on juice. In fact, they show that they are 2/3 bars charged until they suddenly die with no warning despite the software clearly detecting that they are on i.e. 10% because I can check this from the Oculus app.- The home UI can sometimes be buggy at times and throw menus around in a strange way. More care could be taken by Oculus to make a truly stable UI before they invest so much time into adding new software features as bugs and glitches in VR can be jarring and/or nauseating.

I love the Oculus Quest. It's my first VR system, and I've not been so wowed by a product ever. I own a powerful PC, so was concerned about the decision between getting a tethered VR for better graphics, or a standalone one for the flexibility and overall experience. I went for the Quest and it was the right choice. The graphics not being as good as tethered systems really isn't an issue. The lack of headphones isn't an issue. Being locked in to the Oculus store isn't an issue - games are very cheap compared to other consoles. Oculus have really nailed it with the Quest.

Fantastic piece of kit with ground breaking (and standard setting )accessibility options. The guardian system takes about 10 secs to set up and the pass through option when you've left your marked area enables you to see a grainy black and white video of the outside world. Stepping back into the guardian area is one of those wow moments that never gets old, and you haven't even started any apps yet!The tracking on the 6dof controllers is nearly flawless assuming you stay away from bright sun light (draw the curtains!). I also noticed my ceiling fan seemed to interfere with tracking sometimes, an easy fix and its not particularly fun smashing your hands into such (giant) spinning (chopping ) devices when immersed in vr anyway. turn the fan off!The headset is comfortable enough and includes a handy slider to adjust the distance between your eyes, pupils specifically. Feel free to fiddle , you'll get fewer eye strain induced headaches as a result of finding your own sweet spot. Unfortunately, there is no (as yet) on screen readout of the (I)inter(P)upillary(D)istance setting so those of you that know their own numbers will still need to play around with the slider.There are a decent selection of apps and games availiable currently with Beat Saber, platform exclusive Vader Immortal:Episode 1 and Superhot being essential purchases for the system in my opinion.Beat Saber is the killer app here and you simply must try it to see what all the fuss is about. It was made for this system and having played it on rift, there is little difference in graphical fidelity( in fact it looks crisper on the quests higher res headset). Not having a massive cable to trip over makes this by far the best platform for the game.Battery life is about 2/half hours, more if just viewing media, slightly less if  maniacally attempting to climb the beat saber  leaderboards until your eyes melt.If you've never had a vr experience before, this is currently the best way to get onboard, sure, the textures can be a bit lo res in some of the games, and they have a mid level snapdragon (645?)mobile processor powering the action, so don't expect the power of say a rift plus a monster pc, but no pc is required here! The freedom you have makes for a much more immersive (the magic word of vr) experience and is the right trade off to make over a more powerful (no doubt heavier) model.

I'd been on the fence about buying into VR for a while. First time I put the headset on I regretted not getting one sooner. The games are great. Superhot, Beat Saber and the new Vader Immortal are fantastic examples. Sharing that experience is also really easy as the headset is not tethered to anything. Your friend wants a go? Just take the headset to their house. You can also stream the footage to your phone or Chromecast devices so everyone can get involved. What's even better is that a future update to the Quest (and an extra cable or so) will enable you to play Rift games on it too. There's never been a better time to give VR a go!

It's an amazing bit of kit but the Headset is very uncomfortable after anything longer than 25mins.This is the same for 4 members of my family from young to old so I know it's not just one face type.You need to purchase an Oculus Quest Foam & Interface Basic Set from VR Cover, for an additional $35 from the USA to make this device comfy (or that's what I'm hoping as I had it on the Rift and was great - but it's currently pre-order until 5th June).It's a shame as the ergonomics should of increased in comfort as this is the 6th 6DOF Consumer VR unit produced now by Oculus.

I don't seem to have much luck with VR. I bought a Rift S but I had to return. The screens would display static every now and then and tracking froze constantly. As my IPD (space between eyes) was to large and its not adjustable on the Rift so I returned it and did not exchange. But on the Quest you can adjust IPD and the Quest can work both as a freestanding unit and connected to a PC. Fantastic, problem solved right? Well not quite ! My Quest arrived with a very clear fingerprint inside both lens right in the centre. Its a bit hard to see in the photos but white in the centre of each lens is not a reflection, its a large thumb print under the lens where you can not access.This is clearly only a problem with the Quest I received not all quests but I can only judge by what I have seen and that is Oculus may well have a real QC problem for these to make it though production. Of course buying from Amazon means you always have a safety net of being able to return, so Amazon 10/10All that being said the quest seems like a fantastic VR headset and will be replacing this one with another straight away. Fingers crossed headset 3 will be the winner!

Quest is a remarkable achievement and bodes well for the future of standalone VR. Set up is super simple and tracking is, for the most part, solid.My gripe is that it's just not comfortable. The face pad feels rough on the skin (after not too long) and unless you strap it on uncomfortably tightly it has the tendency (being front weighted) to gradually slip down the face and thereby causing loss of focus within the vertical 'sweet spot'.So in summary, Quest a technical marvel, marred by ergonomic failings.

So to start with this machine is an amazing piece of kit. It makes great VR affordable and easy for anyone that is either no good with PCs or can't afford a high end gaming computer. You are very much fully immersed in any game you play and the guardian system is a stroke of genius. My issue is I am currently sending back my second headset to amazon. The first arrived with a broken mic so conversation in multiplayer was next to impossible. The second arrived very quickly but had dead pixels in the dead center of the screen which broke immersion and was visible no matter the game. I decided to get refund as I can't be bothered with a third broken one. But when the console works (my friend has one) it really works and is amazing. VR is finally here.

Doesn’t fit nearly so well as my older Rift. The price of wireless freedom is constant discomfort and and slippage. The discomfort is worsened when looking at software pricing. All my favourite Rift games must be purchased again at full price if I want to play them with inferior graphics, tracking and comfort. Considering that I picked up most titles in sales, the price I now have to pay is double what I already paid, and there no sign of similar sales discounts on Quest titles. Worse than this, now I can’t enjoy browsing the store, I’m forced to choose whether I want the Rift or Quest version and end up choosing neither because it all seems like such a rip-off. for a handful of titles you can just pay once, but it’s not for the good ones like BeatSaber, Superhot, Moss or Red Matter.

Initial impressions are that this is truly transformative. I'm coming from no previous exposure to good quality VR. Purchased this yesterday, it's well packaged and feels premium out of the box. I would advise you to pick up the travel case available through the Oculus site as I wouldn't like to just leave it around in the open. Set up is really straight forward, and make nice use of a couple of demos. I picked up Vader Immortal and put that on and you are genuinely able to get lost in the game and forget that it's a 'game'. Graphics are not groundbreaking, but it is more than enough to become engrossed, and in my limited usage so far is fantastic fun. I'll come back and update my review after a while of using it.

The Oculus Quest is much better than the Oculus Go on several fronts.  The Oled screens give very good blacks and there is an adjuster for pupil separation which helps a lot for people with wide eyes.  The Glasses spacer is better than the GO too.  Soon the Quest will have a link cable to a PC so that Quest Rift games can be played, so the Quest gives an entry to this large ecosystem. The two Left/Right hand controllers are superior to the simple GO single controller and make gaming very active. Also coming soon is actual hand tracking rather than using the hand controllers... how cool is that ?! Finally the gaming floor space can be mapped out and stops you running into walls or knocking vases off of tables.  The Quest does not require external sensors or wires (unless the new PC Rift cable) to operate so you are free to move in all directions while playing active games,  So imho the quest is worth the £150 to pay more than the Go.

This VR headset does not come cheap. But WOW .. what an experience. You really are in another world. There are no lost frames, no freezes. It really is the business. Add that to the fact (and a big deal) that there are no wires to get in the way and tether you ... Amazing. I purchased the 128gb, but you'll be just as well of with the 64gb.

First good points:The experience is just SO REAL! Doesn’t matter if you’re a gamer or just like to watch movies, you must try!I love video games and this is just another level.When I want to watch a movie and my girlfriend is sleeping I put this on and feels like I have a 100”!(Seriously it feels like watching on the cinema)It doesn’t have wires and it’s very small so can’t carry anywhere and you can move all you want when playing.Resolution and games looks amazing (yes I thought the stand alone would only have bad games but that’s not true!)You don’t need a computer!put it on and playBad things:Maybe price is a bit expensive.Controller batteries are not rechargeable and they don’t last very long.Uncomfortable.. it is not heavy but you can feel the weigh in front(I always get marks under my eyes even using 5min).Glare.. when watching movies is when you can see it more and it is annoying(when white colors are on the screen normally)Light from nose; there is a big gap (on my case) between mask and nose and I can see a lot of light that can interfere the experience.Battery time is not more than 2h in my experience (longer watching movies)

My previous experience of VR is: 20mins ""Virtuality"" back in the '80s; 10hrs various Google Cardboard; 30hrs Samsung GearVR; 50mins Oculus Rift; 15mins HTC Vive.The Quest blows Cardboard and GearVR away with its room-scale 6DoF, the controllers, the image quality;  While it can't challenge the Rift or Vive image quality or their complexity of content, the lack of cables and having no need of a PC/Laptop is a real game-changer.  Audio is built in; a mic, and stereo sound fed through the side bars of the harness; adequate in a quiet room, but you can connect other headphones anyway to match your needs.Facebook/Oculus have addressed some of the initial complaints with several firmware and software updates since release, and as far as I can tell it's all to the better.  E.g., some apps for the Oculus Go and Samsung GearVR are now available to use on the Quest via an emulation.  I already had ""Lands End"" for the GearVR, and just played it again on the Quest.  Hoping for Esper and Esper2, fingers crossed...As it's become a very popular item in the last year the support and development for this platform will continue to increase, lots of nice new content, lots of nice new accessories, and an ever increasing user-base.  All to the good for the Quest's ecosystem.Care instructions say to never use any liquids to clean the lenses at all.  What are they made of, sugar?Probably best to keep them covered with something to keep off all dust, and maybe get a decent lens blower/brush as used for cleaning D/SLR cameras.Fit: I found it wasn't comfortable to wear; after almost an hour of adjusting the straps I was still feeling a lot of the weight on either my forehead or cheekbones.  You may be luckier, no two faces/heads are the same, so I just accepted this as a problem I needed to address myself, so I did.I got an add-on battery pack that fits behind the head and doubles as a counterweight.  And it improved things a lot; I went from tolerating the Quest on my head for 1hr maximum to almost forgetting it was there for 4hrs+.  There's several 3rd-party ones to choose from, get one.Light leakage: I found some, through the sides ( I wear glasses, and wider ones can keep the padding slightly away from my face ), and through the nose area which I found to be large enough to see through.  OK, I've a small nose, so the extra space is probably good news for those with a larger nose, the Quest won't mash it flat or pinch it closed.Glasses; my newest pair are very wide but they fit inside the Quest anyway, and the Quest comes with an additional part to increase the distance between the headset and your face to help accommodate larger pairs if needed.Pros: Portable; cable-free; built-in audio; no need for gaming PC/laptop; room-scale 6DoF; lively ecosystem.Cons: Heavy on the face; battery life is 2-3 hrs depending on what it's doing; really needs accessories to work to it's full potential so budget for those too.

Incredible. Exceeded all expectations, and mine were pretty high already. The tracking works flawlessly, the immersion is amazing.Some fun games, tho the experiences are fairly short for the individual game prices, with seemingly loads more coming out. Seems to succeed in having the sought after broad appeal, my techie colleagues at the digital agency i work at loved it, whilst my mum is also now buying one after getting hooked on beat sabre.Only downside is that the headset straps arent adjustable enough to fit my wifes, apparently tiny, head.

First of all, I must stress I love this device. In terms of the features you get for the money, nothing comes close. I was able to play Alyx and other Steam VR games completely wirelessly through Virtual Desktop (a separate £14.99 purchase but worth every penny) and they run flawlessly. To play VR with a cable attached now seems like madness to me.HOWEVER. The unit I received had a cluster of dead, black pixels in the middle of the left lens. I contacted Oculus who asked me to take a photo of the offending pixels, and they agreed to replace it. The replacement unit I received had one green stuck pixel, nowhere near as bad, but still distracting enough for me to contact Oculus again. They sent me another replacement, and yet again, another green stuck pixel. I'm on my fourth unit now and AT LAST all the pixels are behaving as expected.Maybe I just got very unlucky, who knows. I love this device, but the quality control is apparently shocking. But to their credit, Oculus support were excellent and agreed to replace every faulty headset (with about a week turnaround each time)I wholeheartedly recommend the Quest, just prepare yourself for the possibility of those dreaded pixels and a few days of emailing back and forth to get them fixed.UPDATE: the fourth one has a dead pixel too. I give up. I am a broken man.

Was a bit janky at first and I was ready to send it back but. For first time vr this is great. The tracking is good and the no set up with any external sensors means you can use it anywhere.I use rechargeable batteries in my controllers and they don't last very long. Since I don't buy disposable batteries this isn't much of an issue.The games are pricey but with oculus link around the corner it's an exciting time to own a quest device.

Was going to buy the Go but ended up going with the Quest and it was definitely the best choice. I love playing in this. Sure the games library is a little short at the moment but that will grow quickly. Its got games such as Beat Saber and Star Wars plus activity games such as Box VR and Creed to help exercise, I'm on it everyday. There are social apps too such as Rec Room and Alt space where you can meet and talk to new people anywhere in the world. This is the future of VR to bring it into the mainstream.

The Oculus Quest is a amazing piece of technology. Playing VR games with no tether in place makes it amazing with its also built in sensors to map everything for you. It’s easy to set up roughly 10minutes. Overall gaming experience is just amazing this is the best one to have as a first VR or maybe just the best in general, as you can take it anywhere and just play without having to require internet.There isn’t many games on it yet but the games on so far are amazing, more games will be coming in the future. The only problem I had with it was the tracking of the controllers. Sometimes they lost tracking and they just wouldn’t respond. But it’s an easy fix with either a restart or battery swap. They VR last around 2 hour play time with 2 hour charging time, but inside it feels more than 2 hours.Overall, it is worth it.

The quest is a great device, even better now that I can play Steam VR titles using Oculus link. The screen is as good if not better than the Vive Pro which I have used a lot over the last year. I really like the controllers, they are comfortable and the batteries last for weeks rather than hours. The headset is not as comfortable as others I have used. But if you spend some time adjusting the straps you can get a reasonable level of comfort. I would recommend purchasing a case, I have the official one and it's perfect for keeping the headset stored neatly out of the way.  The quest is the first truly great VR headset. I'd say this is the new benchmark in quality for VR.

Was a little sceptical when considering the Quest. How could it be any good at just £399 without the power of a gaming PC to drive it.Have to admit I’m blown away by the quality from this very portable rig. As long as the developers support the platform this device will be huge!! Graphics are decent & oled display is lovely. Don’t notice any limitation of the 72hz refresh rate. Tracking from the 4 cameras is good, controllers comfortable & 2.5 hour charge life is enough as VR is quite exhausting & headset although not heavy is tiring without a break. This is VR that can go anywhere. No more stuck in one gamespace tethered to a PC. 64gb storage gives you enough space for plenty of games which are all between 500mb & 1.5gb.You can take the virtual world to friends, family, parties and still have online multiplayer available. Only minor criticism is that the bigger games are relatively expensive at between £15-£20. The potential to connect to an existing PC coming with the Oculus Link update will give it more longevity & access to a bigger game catalogue.If you are just getting into VR though this is a great bit of kit.

I pre-ordered this a couple of weeks ago and was happy to see it arrive day one of release. With the hype surrounding it, I was a bit skeptical it could live up to expectations. I was NOT disappointed. I owned an Oculus Rift about a year ago, back before they released the motion tracked controllers which I wasn't too impressed with. The Quest is a different story though. The 6 degrees of freedom, completely tetherless is amazing! Well built and the tracking is great. The blacks in the display are so much better than the rift I had and the clarity of the screen feels much clearer and sharper. Obviously, the actual graphics of the games won't match a PC VR headset but I've played about 5 games so far and the experience far outweighs the negatives of the lesser graphics to the point you don't even care. Very happy so far with this device.

This is quite a jump in immersion coming from the Gear VR. Its early days and the list of good games available is small, but growing. I'm bored of tv gaming, this adds a whole new dimension. The freedom from being tethered to anything cannot be underestimated also. Cant wait to see where this product takes us.

I have had this for 4 months and I use it every single day. It's still a technological dream come true and I cannot imagine life without VR. I am such a fan, I decided to buy and build a gaming PC to go with it. Now, I can link to a high end gaming card and play all the cross platform games I want. When you link to a powerful PC the Quest suddenly leaps into new realms of abundance in both display quality and quantity.  Unlike most gadgets, this one can expand and enrich your social life in a never-before-seen way.

Absolutely amazing!No wires, just you and the VR experience.Watching movies, browsing the web or playing really cool VR games at your freedom!Sit on the couch, sit on a gaming chair or stand up, this VR headset lets you choose your spot freely, with no wires attached.I have never felt so comfortable whilst in VR.Compared to other headsets I've tried, this definitely beats them!I highly recommend this to anyone, even if you want to play PC VR, the Oculus link will allow you to connect your Oculus Quest to your PC using one single wire and it will allow you to get to experience PC VR Games, giving you the best of both worlds.

Really impressive. I've been a long term Oculus user, from original dev kit through to the oculus rift consumer version. The ability to just pick this up and start playing is phenominal, and a light and day experience compared to previous generation. The basic graphics quality is, understandably, less than its PC tethered sibling, however it more than compensates with fantastic usability and immersion. This self contained device represents a new era and the future of VR for me.

Arguably the best bang for buck headset on the market. It's a great individual games console that you can take on the go, while also delivering a very fun PCVR experience too with Oculus Link. If you don't have a gaming PC then this is the headset to get. If you do, there are other better options solely for that but I'd consider a Quest still as Oculus link works very well, and honestly the portability works great for when you're bored in a hotel room or at a relatives.

I've an Oculus Go and Rift but the Quest is the one I use most now. The Oculus Store's a bit threadbare at the moment because it's a new device, but some good stuff there already and worth it for me just to keep fit with Beat Saber and Box VR, no wires to get in the way and a great, fun way to workout. I got the 64Gb, which I've used about half of so far and seems about right for my use. If you consume a lot of media, films, games etc you might need more. Overall really pleased I got this.

WOW what an amazing product my Oculus Quest is. What really impressed me is the vast scale of the environments in the games, truly real life scale. I also like the Guardian system that saves you bumping into walls etc, it works flawlessly. The main interactive menu environment system is also a dream to use, very polished.  The hand controllers have instant response very impressive indeed. The only down side for me is a slightly uncomfortable face after extended game play, otherwise its all good. The included Vader Immortal games also work flawlessly and very smooth. Its great to hold and use the light saber.

For anyone who is asking how this lines up with the gear VR, let me tell you, there is no comparison. This is a truly astonishing machine, particularly as it is wire free. Don't get me wrong, the gear VR is still brilliant and I also have the PSVR, but I still don't feel short changed. The screen on the quest is better and the graphics are right up there too.

I expected VR to be good but didn't think it would be as immersive as it is you can get lost in the game. Only negative I can think of is related to some of the games which can make me feel motion sick if there is a lot of movement without real world movement. There is ways the game developers have combated this though and have a comfort level on each game before buying them so it shouldn't be an issue. Nevertheless I would highly recommend anyone to buy one they are great fun.

Consoles are no more, the cloud has taken over so the next level is this; total immersion, diffficult to sell on youtube video and reviews, you need to see it for yourself, best thing I have bought in years. only downside for me is the comfort of it but easily solved with various straps / pads etc available to find your personal solution to the weighty front of it.

I bought the Oculus Go In December and thoroughly enjoyed it but then I heard about the Oculus Quest and was very intrigued about it’s capabilities, I questioned myself do I purchase another VR device ? I followed the news and updates up to the release date and bought one, my first impressions were it’s so amazing which I still haven’t changed my opinion on. The videos on online don’t do it justice, you have to experience it then I’m sure you’ll go and break your piggy banks to buy one. The learning curve is a fast one and ease of use soon becomes second nature. You will want to show your family and friends the joy of VR. So if you have any doubts ask a friend or a family member a try and you’ll have the biggest gasping gawp on your face and check your watch to see if your local electrical department store is open so you can rush out and buy one.It’s a great gadget or experience for every family member, the only downside is trying to convince them to give it back for your turn.All the pluses, untethered, great display, fantastic immersion, all-in-one an all round great experience.

Without doubt, this is the best VR/gaming experience you can get.  The whole family can play and it's as easy as picking it up, adjusting the head strap and go. There isn't a lot of games yet but the ones that are there are great. Everyone loves it, and it is much easier to use than the PSVR which requires a lot of setup, forces you to face a camera and has a big wire.

Takes a little time to get the headset comfortable and still a bit front heavy for using more than a couple of hours but not a problem as by then the battery needs a re-charge.

The freedom of having no wires or sensors or computer is difficult to quantify, but as an owner of an HTC vive, i can say without a doubt the quest is better.

I am a Vive owner (a high quality VR headset connected to my PC). This cost me £700, and my PC cost me around £900. I have been playing with VR for the last two years, and I love it.Let me just describe how I would play BeatSaber.Boot up PC, load Windows. Load up Steam VR, wait for the inevitable patches and downloads to complete.Check all the VR headset cables and base stations are plugged in. Unwind cable from under the desk.Load SteamVR, wait for it to turn on the base stations, then do the usual ""base station error occurred please restart"". Restart SteamVR, go into Steam menu, load up BeatSaber, wait in a grey screen for a few minutes for it to load. Clear some space next to the PC, start playing.Total time from start to playing - around 10 minutes. Total cost - around £1700Allow me to describe how I play the exact same game with almost the exact same graphic quality - and slightly faster responsiveness in the new Oculus Quest.Lift up headset. Put it on. Click on BeatSaber, wait 3 seconds for it to load. Play.Total time from start to playing - around 30 seconds. Total cost £420 (£399 for the headset, £20 for the game).I took this to work yesterday. Something I could never do with the Vive. I just walked into the office, and passed it to a colleague, who put it on their head and went ""OMFG!"" and then ordered one.This thing is incredible. Its full VR. With nothing but this fairly light (compared to the vive) headset and two small controllers (which seem to magically know what my hands are doing!).Believe the hype. This is the future. VR is finally here.

Before I begin, I want to point out that I've been in VR since 2012 and have owned every Oculus product thus far. From DK1 to Rift... Each has their own advantages and disadvantages and in many ways the Oculus Quest has been the best yet.Having spent many years with the Rift, its predecessors and last year's Oculus Go, my expectations for the Quest have been managed and realistic. Therefore upon donning the impressively comfortable headset and jumping right into the setup process I was pleasantly reassured that this was going to meet snd in some areas exceed my preconceptions. Last year's Oculus Go introduced us to the kind of freedom wireless VR can provide albeit without the full movement and hand tracking of its bigger brother. But the ability to ""Netflix and chill"" in VR, on the sofa, in bed or outside was the real system seller. A decent screen and integrated software made it a neat little, realistically priced VR headset, that pointed to the direction Oculus would go in future iterations.The Quest is a BIG step up from that and expands on it in every conceivable way. Sure the cost has gone up but the hardware is significantly more impressive to use because of it. Tracking is flawless 99.9% of the time and simply playing top VR games like Beat Saber and Superhot without getting tangled in wires is without a doubt the most fun I've had in VR. These games not only succeed, but excel on the Quest. Simply brilliant. Robo Recall was a little bit of a let down having spent countless hours on the PC version, the essence is the same but the drop in graphic fidelity was noticeable and slightly off-putting, that being said if you're new to that game then you're going to have a blast nonetheless.All in all, the Quest is hands-down THE BEST standalone VR headset currently available. The price tag reflects this but if your pockets and interest in this run deep enough then don't hesitate. You won't regret it.

Ok, so...when i rarely review something it's more likely to be a little more wary / negative..that's my nature..if your happy with someone, unless blown away or such a fan of things you want to share it with the World - they are the only times i would likely 'review'.Putting on Oculus Quest ( purchased from Argos btw same price, including Vader games ) was literally an amazing 'WOW' experiance...honestly! I dont like to follow the herd but seriously..as so many have said, the future is now!This is updated, having used it a fair bit.Partner was 'annoyed' at me spending so much...she put it on..and honestly said, 'is that all it cost!! - for what you get'I have shown to buddies and tried to promote this thing - everyone is in awe.ENOUGH ENOUGH...apple for the teacher!!THE BAD.yes, the bad.Battery isnt the longest, charging a lot ( but, i find you do need a break - for your eyes- and you can still play whilst charging )Uncomfortable. Yes, it is. The fabric does get 'smelly'...im purchasing another product to replace this - looking around, seems a choice out there. Also, it hugs your face, my daughter tends to have to hold it up a little..she is not 13 ( recommended age but close to it ) . It is face heavy. In a game, it's ok...i find it ok...blurry a little...not much option to alter that.Its bright. All this blue light talk...not good for your eyes etc...you are close..i dont think it is good for you, a little heat comes off it...i think anyway..close to eyes...short bursts of playing. Jury out, but i dont think it's doing you much good ..saying that, some of the free apps etc..calming ones etc...it is amazing to view and relaxing.Buy a carry case..seriously..where you storing it?  and def. the adjustment mask, i think VR Gear make one...need to look myself.And thats about it i guess. Bit pixalated, you can certainly tell its running at it's peak at times ie, Moss game, lovely, but look around you and its maxed out ( maybe im wrong..but seems to be generating the best it..which is fab, its great, amazing..but this is the tip of the iceberg...we will look back at NOW and see this in same way we look back on 80's games..those old enough to live through that..Spectrum 48k rubber keypads - amazing - same as this...this is the start. Support it.THE GOOD.Just an easy, amazing experiance allround. Honest. Try it, you WILL be amazed.Games, some offers, Climb ( i got a refund as was good..but i bought too many at first...to easy to buy..claimed back refund on a few..but I miss Climb )Racket NX - online - love this tennis type game. Nothing amazing..but it's fab.Beat Saber - buy it.Vader - a lot of talking, can't die in it etc..but still impressive.Pistol Whip - fab, always go back to it.Robot Recall - good..not quite as good as I thought...arcady style...im keeping it.Hightlight is - Superhot...at first..wasnt sure..play it...and play it again...and again....you need space when you throw cups and whatever, hiding behind cabinets..because you will do that!Overall - its a excellent purchase fro 400quid and will only go down in price. An experiance well worth the pricetag..honest.Btw, i had a little difficulty when refunding some games, i refunded a lot all at once...if you play less than 2hrs and within14days money back....so it did say ' you have played more than 2hrs' for some games which i definately didnt. However, emailed Oculus, quick helpful replies..no issues...refunded.

I'm having major problems with the wifi on my headset and i don't think it is a faulty unit.  The wifi connection drops every 20 or so minutes.  Every time it happens i get an error message and have to stop what I'm doing to go into the settings to reset the wifi. It is extremely annoying and worrying if i don't find a fix soon.  I have read that oculus knows about this problem but they are unwilling to acknowledge the problem exists.  They are trying to brush it under the carpet.If you are using a TalkTalk super router (SAGEMCOM FAST 5364) then you may get this problem happen to you.  There is a fix but i have not tried it yet as there are a lot of steps involved in getting it to work.Apart from this there is also the problem of the headset being uncomfortable due to its weight and the lack of decent head support.  You need to buy another strap that goes on top of your head if you want to use the headset for longer than half an hour.I also wish they had gone for a more powerful processor than the snapdragon 835, which at the time of this review is a three year old mobile processor.  But i guess it's understandable when you consider how much they have packed into a £399 headset.The tracking is excellent.  Screen door effect is present but not too intrusive. Screen resolution is adequate. We are a few years away from really high screen resolution. Field of view is ok.  For the price, i am impressed with the specs.Some of the apps are disappointing.  There is no decent tennis game on the Quest that can compete with Wii Tennis, the only flight sim available has issues, and there is still no decent racing game available on the Quest.I just found out that you will soon be able to connect the Quest to a PC using just a USB 3.1 cable to run Oculus Rift games. That is a very welcome development that makes buying the Quest very worthwhile.Overall, this could easily have been a 5 star headset if only i didn't have the very worrying wifi problems that I've been having, plus the other lesser problems.

THIS IS A FULL REVIEWFinding a review to explain exactly what the VR experience entails is a difficult oneMany simply state it being hard to explain and just buy one to find outThe problem with this is that it is a very expensive way of just jumping in blind to find out for yourselfI made the plunge after years of doubt, and having unsuccessfully found anywhere to trial oneWell, i wasnt disappointedTrying to describe the VR experience is in fact as hard as others have said, but i think the experience can be described in order to give a sense of what it offersVisuals - i can best describe my experience, using the Oculus Quest, as giving an immersive, 3D / holographic type of experience.Back in the 80's our school had a travelling science group who showed us holograms, looking through boxes or tubes, seeing the visual holograms of certain objects, animals etc.These images appeared 3 dimensional, and also appeared to be, in a sense, floating within this infinite 3 dimension space.This is the experience that VR, in general, offers.Take Robo Recall for example, my first outing in to VRIt immerses you in what feels (or the brain is tricked) like a real life city, albeit in an obvious computer game graphical visual. However, where it shines is that interactions while fighting/shooting the robots, in that they appear correctly, at various distances, scaled correctly, shadow details, etc and the rendered 'box' of the robots is incredibly accurate. 'Grabbing or shooting at the robot, gives a real sense that they are actually there, in front of you (or behind) and you find yourself reacting automatically to duck dodge or block them.VR is this ability to construct a 3 dimensional arena/world, and tricking the brain to immerse you as if it were real. The only thing that holds you on to actual reality is the obvious computer rendered images you see (and the occasional hitting your knuckles on a nearby desk or wallOculus Quest UnitHardwareThis unit is my first jump in to VR, so i have nothing to compare it to, however, I've bought many an item over the years, and can clearly judge that this item is of top rated build qualityThe plastics are hard, feel sturdy, have differing surface finishes depending on if its where you would normally hold or touch.The straps are adjustable, feel strong and hard wearing.The foam padding is comfy and soft, and does an excellent job of block out light.The lenses / screens have an adjustment facility for those with eye issues. I have on eye with long distance issues, however i can wear my oculus with out my glasses and have no issues with seeing clearly.It is possible to buy lense inserts from the Oculus approved company by giving them your prescriptionI havent opened up the unit to look at the internals (nor will I), but this unit uses OLED screens with a high resolution, a high brightness, and the blackest of blacks. The refresh rate doesnt cause any tearing or slowdowns when things get fast paced.The battery has a supposed life of around 2 hours, ive achieved slightly higher than this, but it will depend on the software, games etc that you are running.The touch controllers are superb, and i was blown away with how accurate the xyz position and displaying of these were on the unit. Being able to grab, move it and see corresponding actions on screen only immerses you more in the experience. For the controllers i would recommend grabbing a pack of 4 rechargable batteries and charger. The touch controllers use a single AA battery each and seem to last perhaps 20+ hours, but i cant be certain of this as i changed mine out when it informed me onscreen, but on checking were still about 40% fullSoftwareThis area was a surprise for me, id had a quick look and saw a few games ertc, but it wasnt until i installed the oculus app on my phone (this is required on initial first turn on of unit) and the oculus app on my pc (not required to play on oculus), that i saw the shear amount of additional software tools available.The Quest can be run as a standalone unit, using just the Quest store for software.However, plug in a cable and attach it to your VR capable PC opens up a whole 'rift' of possibilities.This software, Oculus Link' enables the quest to access the Rift store, hereby giving full access to the complete list of software available on the PC based Rift store, thus opening even more games and apps.From there you can also instal SteamVR, and access the VR content on the Steam store.This whole process is a simple case of buying the correct USB-C to C cable (must be capable of delivering power and data, normally advertised as 10GB cables) and allowing the oculus pc software detect your headset, install the Oculus Link software (in Beta, but its works well), then on the Quest home screen, you simply click on the beta link button and it transfers you to the Rift home screen and store. For steam it requires SteamVR (which is in your 'tools' folder not games)The oculus software enables you to map out your room, drawing around everything using the touch controllers, this gives you a safe area, and the system will bring up a grid on your eye screens when you get too close (this can be adjusted and changed very easily if you use the Quest in another room etc. As the quest version is primarily wire free, portability function is great on this)An app called Virtual Desktop adds another element, in that, if you hook up the headset to your pc via usb-c thunderbolt port, it will display your PC desktop, and full functionality to your Quest and controllers, hereby giving access to anything you have on your pc ie. Games, documents, files, videos and the full plethora of the internet.I havent tried watching films on the unit yet, Netflix, Amazon etc all have apps on the Quest store, not sure if 3D films played via a pc dvd drive would show in 3D tooI'll finish this review off nowIf you were like me, sat on the fence, pondering the costs, is it worth it, do i really need it, or does someone in my family really need it, then i would say YES. It really is a mind blowing experience.If cost is an issue, start your experience with a low end unit, as long as its a true VR headset, the likes of PS4 headsets or Oculus Go can give a relatively cheap way of getting in to it, or if your like me, a nice 2nd hand unit off e.bay is a good optionAll told, its a worthy investment, and resale values look goodHope this helps

What can I say.........Well Amazing doesn't even get started to covering it.I haven’t gamed in 20yrs but I knew I wanted this as soon a watched the videos of the Quest getting it ready for launch.For someone new to VR & modern gaming to a broader degree it is astonishing and literally will take you places that feel real but don’t actually exist.The opening scene in Robot Recall sent shivers down my spine, it induced a real shock/fear response in me & instantly I knew that the kit I hoped Oculus Quest could be when I ordered it was that and more.Playing in my dining room was a great experience but then I had the idea of would it work in my garden, the sun was behind my house so good light but not bright direct sun light and to my astonishment it works faultlessly.This knowledge of a vast space to play/roam in was transformational and suddenly the experience as more than I could have hope for.Playing the gods world demo game for 30mins I totally forgot where I was and full immersions in the game world was achieved.My neighbors must think I’ve lost the plot as I now stand in the garden for hours on end after work playing Beat Saber and superhot VR.Superhot VR shows that you don’t need earth shattering real world graphics to have something so complete.20yr since I gamed last, looks like I’ve got time to make up & Quest is my platform of choice.My advise try it and find out the main stream VR is here without all the faf and tech-nerd knowledge of the VR system of the past.It’s an instantly accessible, ready to play next level world transforming gaming VR system.What are you waiting for !

First, lets get the bad out of the way. Oculus is owned by Facebook, as from October 2020 for new users (and end of 2023 for current users) you will be required to link a Facebook account to your Oculus to enjoy 'full functionality'.This is hugely discouraging news - firstly its largely come out of nowhere, one of the key appeals of social VR is that your VR self is whoever you want it to be - but now you're Facebook account is going to be permanently linked. Your game play, VR stats and more will turn the Oculus into a advertising pipeline and Facebook will always be watching and listening.Now - this may not matter to you, you might be quite happy to set up a fake account in the name of your pet and link this to it, but I just wanted to get this up front. You want to enjoy Oculus VR games? Fine - but big brother Facebook is going to be on your shoulder watching all the time.---Sorry about that, but it is a 'big' deal, and you need to be aware of it before you decide to buy this.That said, the Oculus Quest, baring questionable Facebook intergration, is a superb gateway entry for VR gaming.I won't recap many of the other reviews - that have already mentioned its amazing wireless gameplay. The solid range of games (Beatsaber, Pistol Whip and Superhot should be your starting picks), and its fair battery life and good comfort for what it is.I would like to draw attention to those that are'nt sure - you can absolutely link this to your computer to play VR games through Steam (such as Half Life Alyx) or through SideQuest (like Doom VR). This turns your Quest from a really great VR device into an a-maz-ing VR device. Oculus Rift? Bah, who needs that?Its a fairly convoluted process, but there are several guides to help you through the process (its a process that Oculus thankfully seems to be on board with, with the new link cable option as well). Through Virtual Desktop you can link to your computer and browse/watch movies and connect to computer ran VR games. Note that you will need a fairly powerful computer, and excellent internet (stay in the same room as your router and computer) but the results are excellent. Half Life Alyx, Blade and Sorcery, Hot Dogs, Hot Dogs, Horseshoes and Hand Grenades - all excellent picks for the Quest via Steam.Anyway, in conclusion - the Quest is seriously impressive and continues to be supported with further development and updates which keep it THE entry VR option. This comes at a price with forced Facebook integration as per my preamble, but if you can hold your nose - the Quest is the best option pound for pound you will find

This headset is beautifully designed and functions really well for the most part, my main issues with the quest is that you can't have multiple users to switch between so it's more or less a single user device.The other issue is streaming the footage to a tv, there is a noticeable delay between what you're doing in the headset and the footage that's displayed on your tv. (keep in mind it's in beta so streaming should get better in time)Yet strangely there is little to no delay if you choose to stream directly to your phone and let people watch from there...I do think that all this will be worked and improved in time so i feel like it's still a solid investment.Additionally the quest itself is rather heavy on your face, similar to Samsungs gear vr, but you get used to it eventually.All that said, when you load into a game and start playing without any pesky wires getting in the way and using the guardian marking system to safely map the area you will play in just feels awesome and liberating!

I didn't buy this product through Amazon but the product itself is poor.So I got the Oculus Quest a couple days ago and the first day was great, had a good few hours of playing. Then the problems started..So you don't have a choice to update the Quest, it will just update at random. When I put it on, it just started updating.. After waiting 15 minutes for the update to process I could hear that the headset was powered on but the screen was black. I did the classic on and off again routine which made the update go again. This happened a couple times with no avail. So looking online, it said this was quite a common issue and it needed to be factory reset. I preformed two, but it didn't work. I took it to a friend who knew alot about tech, he did a side load (loading it from a computer onto the headset) but that failed too.Upon further review of other issues, it said that oculus had to take it back. So I did the natural thing and contact the support. Suprisingly, this wasn't answered in hours like you would expect, it said it would take two days for a response. I'm now on day three and still have been ignored.All round a truly miserable experience, I advise avoiding Oculus for its competitors like HTC or PlayStation.

So, will start off with the ""could be better"" points...-Battery life - lasts around 2 hours, however it comes with a very long charging cable so you can plug yourself in for extra juice, or even attach a power bank and put it in your pocket.-Streaming is buggy - I can't get oculast casting to work for more than 5 seconds with my Huawei mate 20 pro, however it does work ok most of the time with my wife's Note 8.  Occasionally though, a black stream is cast.  I'd like this feature to work better as it's useful when giving the kids a shot and trying to help them.That aside, this thing is incredible...I was wowed the first time I used it while going through the first steps demo.  The boundary guardian feature and the precision of the controller tracking is amazing.  Beat sabre is our favourite game right now, it's really fun for all the family.It's a shame there's not more free content like there is on the Go, but I read most Go content will be playable on the Quest by the end of the year.  Reviews indicate the headset is heavy, I actually was surprised by how light it was and no complaints on weight or comfort by my 5 year old...so don't let this out you off.This is so much more than just a console - it's gaming (in a fun way!), Cinema style movies, 360 videos and experiences and more.

I purchased the Quest from another retailer due to Amazon having no stock. After 2 weeks of playing with this thing, I am still blown away every time I reach for the headset for a gaming session...After researching home and budget VR options (not a PC setup) following an arcade visit in Newcastle, I looked at the Oculus Go which didn't seem to be what I was after from a gaming perspective. I then researched the PSVR but the whole 'faff' of setting up cabling and cameras wasn't something I thought I would be happy to do too for too long. I then stumbled upon the Quest on an online forum and my mind was made up pretty much instantly.This thing is easy to pick up, it is wireless and there is little setup required to get started. I opted to purchase Space Pirate Trainer, Beat Saber and Vader Immortal as my first games and boy, they are immersive! Anyone can get into this, regardless of age and start playing. I would draw comparisons to the Nintendo Wii in that respect.If you are in 2 minds whether to take the plunge, go for it.Mark my words, you will NOT be disappointed.Side note: Instead of purchasing the official case, I purchased a drone case and took out the foam insert, replacing it with the cut out from the original Quest box which fits snugly after a little trimming for less than half the cost.Case example below:https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07DB2Z9FN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

One of the best purchases made for the family. I was apprehensive about buying a VR system due the cost and the fact that I thought I would be the only one to use it. Since getting it out on Christmas it’s been use by pretty must everyone. There are games for all ages and it so easy to setup. As it is an android device you can side load game that have been developed but are not yet on the official quest store. Also getting the 3 Star Wars Immortal games for free was a bonus and easily one best experiences on the Quest.The Quest was only purchased to play Half Life Alyx on PC this year so it is a bonus that you can tether it to a PC and play the Oculus Rift games.

Sort of yes, the quest has a max fps of around 70 so it wont go any higher then that, its refresh rate is also quite low, compairable to a low/medium end moniterso your buying what is essentially a 550 gram paperweight that doesnt perform well at what it is made to do?Just go and buy a HTC vive or a rift s they are just better

I have previously owned a psvr that made me feel sicker than a Victorian street urchin almost as soon as I put it on. I found the motion jarring and the set up a pain. I sold it pretty quickly.I wasn’t sure about taking the leap again but curiosity got the better of me and I ordered one. It is absolutely phenomenal.Tracking is instant and it’s one of those products that just works.The games are all fairly simple by modern standards, but it’s not about how they look. After a few tracks on beat sabre, or trying to dodge bullets in super hot you will be hooked!If you’re on the fence, get down from the fence and buy it. Then forget about the fence entirely.

1. You are forced to buy a lot of extra addons and accessories to make it usable and they tend to be overpriced. It is front heavy and very uncomfortable so I had to get some extra things (straps, counterweight - they cost a fortune!).2. Controller ring broke after I hit it a few times only, which most likely will happen to everyone. A new one costs 80 EUR... Controllers are also weirdly designed with silly rings -  while playing the most popular game, Beat Sabre, I was often hitting my face/vr helmet with those stupid rings.3. Also straps to hold controllers need to be purchased separately - thats another 20-30 GBP out of the pocket.4. Many games and apps are made for Oculus Rift - in order to play them you are forced to a buy a cable (which disconnects often ruining fun) and Virtual Desktop app as well...5. If you dont want to soak the foamy interior with sweat and keep it hygienic for other people as well, then again you have to buy a silicone cover - another 15 GBPOverall I am not very happy that I had to spend all this extra money for necessary accessories and to replace broken controller which is cheaply made and breaks too easily. Also the choice of accessories is very limited (and they are overpriced quality-wise) and available only via external companies. It is like you buy a new game and then realise that you have to spend extra twice that much for DLCs to make it playable. Very dishonest attitude.

Fantastic VR with freedom. I can't believe the Quest does what it does, wirelessly and independently. Whilst it doesn't provide the graphical fidelity of a Vive or Rift S, you don't need a PC to run it. It's a solution for me, as my PC room is small with very limited space. My only complaint is that its pretty front heavy and the store can be expensive.Pros:- Wireless- Looks slick- Great battery life- Easy to setupCons:- Can be uncomfortable- Not as good looking as Rift S / Vive- Store apps can be expensive

Yes. It's a lot of money. However, within about 10 minutes of putting this on your head you will know you've made the right decision spending it.VR technology is incredible and the Oculus Quest is the forefront of it. It doesn't require a PC (although the Oculus Link, which essentially turns your Quest into a Rift whenever you need it), it's very portable and has a solid collection of games. This mean's it is the perfect piece of technology to enjoy with friends and family.Whether you are playing through the platformer Moss, smashing boxes on the music games Beat Saber, shooting robots on Robo Recall, scaring the heck out of someone on The Manor on plugging it into your PC to access titles like Echo, Gorn, Rick & Morty, Trover Saves The Universe, Asguard's Wrath, Stormland or any other title it offers incredible experiences.It's also worth noting just how rapidly Oculus are updating the technology. 6 months ago, the Oculus Link (PC compatibility) and hand tracking didn't exist. Now they do. These are the two biggest changes, but there have been many more (they are on major update 12 at time of writing) and they don't seem to be showing any signs of slowing down.Now is the perfect time to join us in VR! :D

Originally I had a Rift S, but just after, oculus announced that the Oculus Quest would be able to use a USB cable to essentially turn it in to a Rift S, so I returned and awaited early reviews of this new link.I must say that the Oculus Rift S was far more comfortable than this and if you are using only feathered to a PC, I would suggest you get the Rift S.However, the option of being wireless is amazing. I’d much rather use the quest for the likes of beat saver wireless, and games like Thrill of the Fight (boxing sim) are a whole new game wireless.I can’t really tell the difference between the image on the Rift S and via the Oculus Quest Link.The Quest is front heavy and leaves red marks on my cheeks.To improve comfort I’ve use a Velcro strap which I bought from e-bay. It was hard to position it so that it worked but by locating right at the front (and much shorter than you would expect) it takes the weight on to your forehead rather than the cheeks and makes a massive difference. I’ve left a review with pictures on a similar strap on Amazon.To use with the Link, you need to make sure you are not using the Beta versions (which can be turned off in the PC menu) and that your software is updates to version 12 at least . The PC software should recognise the device using a USB 3 cable (make sure you get a compatible one).When you turn the headset in, while plugged in to the PC it will ask if you want to use the Link. Say yes. You may still need to go in to “settings” on your headset, “show all” scroll down to “enable oculus link Beta” and click on the little square. Hopefully you will then be connected and you can see a new menu bar which is slightly curved.Whether it is worth £399, im not sure. It is a “luxury” item at the start of tech. I can’t see that £100 for an extra 64Gb is value and I think it is poor if oculus to charge that much for something that will cost them around £5. Even an extra £50 would have been. Better deal. Games are not that large in size so filling 128gb with games would take a while.

I purchased my Oculus Quest to try the current VR technology, at a reasonable price point, encouraged by the hype surrounding the new Quest Link capabilities. To be clear, I am happy to award 5 stars for the Quest wireless device, but only 4 stars for the Oculus Link.The Quest wireless is easily set-up, using the Oculus mobile app on a device that supports both bluetooth and wireless. The app updates the software on the Quest, and acts as a portal for purchasing, downloading and installing Quest certified (wireless) apps from the Oculus Store. You only use the enclosed USB cable for charging the device.As a wireless device, the Quest works very well, for this price point. However, there is one major design fault: it is incredibly front heavy. I've fitted a home-made counterweight to the back of mine. The Rift S, which costs the same, has a much better head harness, yet the Quest is heavier because of the internal battery.Be aware, the internal battery on the Quest is not replaceable, so you will end-up needing to use the device on permanent charge, and if you damage the USB connector, the device is scrap.As for the Quest Link, be prepared for a battle. I am PC savvy, and this challenged me: in my first 12 hrs of trying to get the Link function to work well, the Windows Event Log recorded over 700 USB and Oculus software errors. I had to install, uninstall and re-install the Oculus PC software twice. Also, whilst others have successfully used the Amazon Basics USB cable, I found the recommended Powerline product to be better. Also, you should use a USB 3.1 or 3.2 port on the back of the PC (direct from the motherboard), with or without a 5Gbs certified powered USB hub. So, £55 extra for two cables and an RSHTech hub. In brief, Oculus Link ""stress tests"" the PC's USB capabilities, to their limit.Once you, your Quest and your Link cable decide to play happily together, you may fall into the next Oculus \ Facebook ""trap"".  Oculus sells Quest (wireless) certified apps (games, players, etc), and it also sells Rift S certified apps, which should \ may work with Quest Link. However, it does not market any Quest Link certified apps. Also, most apps are not cross-sold: you have to pay twice to buy both the Quest (wireless) and Rift S certified versions. My research suggests there are only around 20 cross-sold apps and less than 10 Quest Link certified apps.Lastly, I do understand Oculus Link is still in Beta, and there may be a Quest v2 released later this year.

Where to start,i have the 64gb version,i wear reading glasses and these are not designed for people like me,with the glasses part fitted you get a reflection from the eye pieces and you dont get a realy clear picture as the only adjustment is only sideways and not close and far so i dont wear glasses when playing this now,now to the games, have installed approx 10 to 12 games since having this but had to ask for refund on nearly half as they have problems,being dissabled i like to play them sitting but even though game says you can play sitting you cant because interactive objects are high up,i have found some of the games are bugged/have faults and have had to get refunds for them,the only reason i am keeping the quest is there are some good games coming this year even thoughi am dissapointed with this

I've used all the previous consumer VR headsets as part through my work. I would never, ever buy them with my own money. They have clunky software and hardware set-ups, are nausea-inducing, have too many wires, irritating fuzzy displays etc. The only thing I guaranteed was a headache.Oculus Quest is a game changer.  It just works. An engineering feat. While graphical performance can't touch PC-based VR, the freedom from wires and ease at which it can be used anywhere makes the experience so much more immersive. Finally, computer gaming feels like a physically healthy pastime - no more slumping on the sofa.The only cons are the battery life of 1-2 hours, and the game prices - many slightly higher (>£20) than what I would consider impulse purchase territory.

Pros - Wirelessness is great and adds new dimensions. Oculus Link is a key addition. Sidequest will offer more and more great content. Excellent controllers.Cons - A painfully thin Quest only catalogue, if it didn't have Oculus Link I would've gotten rid. Comfort isn't great but there are more third party options now to adjust it. Screen door effect is always noticeable. It doesn't matter much in games. It does make video watching not fun.Summary - This is a real glimpse of VR's potential in a way I haven't experienced before. This is a long way from the be all and end all and as soon as something with a better screen and similar abilities appears I'll be getting rid of this in a shot. In the meantime I'm looking forward to seeing it grow.

Fun gaming device. Got screwed over by the seller because they gouged the pricing of the oculus 128GB from the original $550 to $750 and when I tried to return they said I had to pay a restocking fee of 25%. That would be $140 to return an item. If you buy from this seller..just dont. However the oculus is a cool VR device and does everything you want it to do and more!

So if you know what you’re buying this is a great product. I see a lot of reviews on here saying that oh well it isn’t necessarily compatible with steam which is technically true but there are ways around that. What this is for is to download the games you want directly onto it and play with no wires attached no PC and mine came in its original packaging and in a speedy amount of time. These guys are not steam and are not oculus there is a retailer that lets you buy it today and not have to wait six months to buy it from the Oculus store. Mine works perfectly and with a little bit of reading I was able to get everything I wanted out of it so far.

Sold my HTC Vive and scooped up one of these. I definitely over paid due to the Covid-19 Oculus shortage but thats only due to my own impatience.The great thing about the Quest is obviously convenience. You can take this thing anywhere and set it up in a minute as long as you're keeping out of direct sunlight so you don't mess up the senors.I will say that I do have a better experience while using Oculus Link and running the games on my PC, but having a small phone inside the headset definitely isn't a downside for when you can't have a computer with you.It is also great that the controllers use double AA batteries instead of having a permanent rechargeable batteries. Do yourself a favor and get an 4 or 8 pack of eneloop rechargeable batteries so you never run out and always have a pair already charged on standby.

BUT IM WIRELESSGames I Got: Gun Club, Arizona Sunshine, Space Pirate, Journey of the Gods, & Dance Central.I took a lot of thought into the Go, Rift, PSVR, PCVR...

Buying this only for the mobility? Probably a mistake. However, with link- which is fully functional now- and a few accessories this quickly turns into a slightly less gouged rift S, with perhaps slightly poorer image quality due to lower refresh rate and lowered resolution in link because of the requirement to push through USB-3(A->C). Unsure of how the quality would be with the more expensive link cable from oculus since they don't exist.Note: rather front heavy so be prepared to make a makeshift counterweight with zip ties if neededGreat for playing PC vr w/ link and a nice PC, with the option to play wirelessly even over 5ghz wifi connected to said PC through virtual desktop fiddling, plus being able to go wirelessly for simple video viewing or less demanding games- which are sadly often gated behind the quest-only store (with some great cross exceptions such as gun club!)essentially: as a vr set by itself, kinda useless after the novelty. With a PC to emulate it as a rift, well worth being price gouged, especially in these trying times. H3VR is absolutely nuts.Do your research on what you want before you buy, though, unlike me. I lucked into being satisfied after enough fiddling but if you can wait two months, probably best to bite the bullet and get the Valve Index, since by the time you get done with price gouging + accessories you're nearing $800 anyway sometimesfinal note: oculus link DOES WORK and 8/10 well, it works over virtual desktop wirelessly or through usb 3 cables -> usb c, kinda heavy, might be uncomfortable to some, if prices lower and aren't gougy may want to consider other headsets if you intend on playing on PC mostly. But in place of a rift S, this is a fine buy with the right technical knowledge.

This thing is surreal. Once i got it and had it ready to go I was blown away and amazed at what I have been missing. I was thrown into a tutorial to get yourself acclimated with VR and the Quest which that in itself was mind blowing. It feels weird at first when you are interacting with things because you loose your sense of touch. So it felt funny picking things up yet still very cool. I couldn't stop laughing and smiling because it literally like leaving your reality and being placed in another. It was beautiful. You felt there. So after the tutorial I immediately downloaded and jumped on Star Wars Immortal. Graphics were stunning and out of this world. I remember the first time I had Darth Vader walk up to me. I was terrified, excited, and almost cried. (But I didn't) He felt like he was right there in front of me. VR really changes the game.  After getting my Star Wars rocks off I decided to go exploring and see what other secrets this guy held.Hand Tracking- I found out that this thing has hand tracking. Its in development but they have a working beta build. And yes hand tracking without a PC or light boxes. It calibrates your hands then once down put the controllers down and use your hands. Now of course you would guess the first gesture any guy would do in this situation.  Haha Anyways, it needs more work but it works almost flawlessly.Visuals-For a stand alone Headset this thing packs a punch on visuals. Everything looks great. I mean I have yet to try out some of the wired VR headsets and what not but from what I have experience there is no lack luster in graphics with the Quest.Games- Now this is were I believe the quest lacks. There really isn't that many games that I would want to play. I am all about the VR FPS games like Onward, High Caliber, Pavlow, etc. None of these games are on Quest YET  but from what I have read they are on there way but slowly. But then again this downside can be countered in the next topic below.Doubles as a Rift headset- Holy smokes, you can literally turn this VR headset into a Rift if you want to. All you have to do is have a compatible cord and you probably want to get a LONG one, plug it into your PC or Laptop, and you are in business. I just happen to stumble across this one day and it makes it even better. One of the cool things is being able to sit in my lazy boy, headset on, and control my computer via VR. This means no keyboard no moue nadda just have dual screens up in one of many nice cozy settings and just be on my PC without the constraints of keyboard and mouse. This also means all the games that are available on Rift you can play via the wired Quest/Rift setup. And they run great!Game Pricing- One of things I thought would be a bit harsh are the game prices. Knowing all the big pricey games that are not VR I thought these games would fall into that same category. To my amazement however they don't! I was able to get 4 games and only spent maybe 80 bucks. The most priciest games go for that I have seen is 40 bucks. They are cheap.Exercise- This thing will kick your butt if you not in shape like me. But at the same time you're having so much fun you'll barely notice. I played the boxing game Creed demo and almost passed out because it really makes you work. You have to swing, block, dodge, move around, etc. Me being me I've never boxed a day in my life so I got winded halfway into the second round. And if you get knocked down you have to move your arms in a running motion to move back towards the light or consciousness. The more you get knocked down the more you have to run back and harder. Eventually I was able to knock my opponent completely out in the 5th round. I was sweating, sore, winded, tired, etc. But I put my arms up in the air like how boxers do after they win and felt like a champ when the crowd was cheering for my victory. Next day I felt like I went to the gym and hit it kinda hard. Mind you I am completely out of shape. There are loads of other games available that can be meant for exercise. Perfect while we are quarantined.Side Effects- Now this kinda can be different for each user. For me I experience what they called if I can remember something like VR disconnect.  Basically you VR for long hours then you take a break but what happens is your brain is all screwy where you pick things up or touch things. It doesn't register right away that you are touching or holding something. So you pick something up and for a small second you can't feel it or you feel like your brain is lagging. To me I was far from freaked out but actually found it interesting and cool. But the more you VR the less this will happen. Though there are some other serious mental side effects that can happen but for me I experience none of them except my brain being slow. I would Google them before hand so you know what you could expect.All in all there is so much going for this thing and Oculus has done right by VR. If you are not strapped for cash and can definitely afford this? Do it. Do it. Do it!

I adore everything about this system. As soon as it arrived, I unboxed it and was so excited to play with it that I didn't even wait for it to charge -- I just played with it plugged in. Worked amazingly, but obviously it was even better the next time I played without the cord in the way! It's really immersive and freeing to be able to walk around while you're in the games and not have to worry about getting tangled or tripped up. I went to space and I did magic in my first couple days of owning this, and it was a BLAST! The home environment alone is gorgeous and I'm genuinely in awe every time I load in and look up at the aurora above me. I could be happy just lying on the floor and staring up at that for hours!Everything was really intuitive as far as getting it adjusted to fit my head and eye-width. I didn't even need to consult instructions. It was also really easy to set up with the phone app, and was as simple as entering in a number on the screen inside the headset after it was turned on. I've never used any Oculus products before, so I'm super impressed with the headset and controllers and how well everything worked. I had no issues with everything recognizing each other or working in the games.  The games don't seem to take up much space at all, so I'm glad I went ahead with just the 64gb version. The library itself isn't yet massive, but there's a good variety of different genres and things to check out as well has new things being added! Plus, if you get the link cable, you can also play Rift games and that opens up a whoooole new world of games.I 100% recommend this to anyone wanting to get into VR or anyone who's already into VR and just wants that wireless experience.

When i frist started using the oculus quest. I would get very dizzy. it would mess with my brain. this is coming from a 30 year old who's been doing PC gaming for a long time.Now, you can play games right off the device. battery lasts about 1-2 hours per charge and the initial software is pretty solid and only a few minor issues with hand tracking sometimes getting lost. but nothing too annoying.Beta link for the PC is buggy! the overlays can cause some seriously bad headace inducing Glitches and Performance loss, there is allot of factors to consider such as your type of Cable link to your PC. There are a ton of options to tweak and try.running off  - 8350fx 32gb ram, 970gtx windows 10get a 10 foot or more cable and make sure to secure your Cables so they dont pull on the USB ports ""Wear it out"" much like a 3 year old phone with a loose charging cable.""also recommend getting Rechargeable double AA batteries system as the controllers Eat through Batteries.

Product was great! Shipping was slow but understandably so due to the Covid-19 concern. I probably should have looked into what I was buying first because you are not able to play games such as Skyrim, Half Life, or some other big titles on this Oculus Quest headset, but regardless, it is still very fun to use. I was not able to find the actual true price for this product but it is much too expensive for it’s worth. I got the 64GB with the lowest price shipping and still cost me a total of $600. It would be more worth it if I was able to play the games that I want to (and I know that does not have anything to do with the seller!) but regardless it was way overpriced for what you get. If you want a VR headset make sure you do your research so you get what you want at a reasonable price!!

What an amazing device! I immediately set it up on my phone and for my first experience I tried the Tripp demo.... amazing how much you can feel like you’re floating and still be slightly aware of gravity, kinda like flying dreams! I cannot wait to explore  what other experiences await, but it’s just to 75% battery. Unless something catastrophic happens I probably won’t update this. Solid unit. There’s a slight pixelation effect (it’s a different thing, but the best way to describe it). I only really noticed it at the home base, while in game it’s negligible or non existent. This is definitely worth checking out / tech that is amazing and developing, and I feel I’m helping show consumer interest by this purchase as well. Definitely feels like a portal to the future!

So I'm new to virtual reality and during times like these I thought it would benefit me to buy the oculus. Now I got the quest only because you are able to move freely and also play on PC. People complain about the front end being heavy and how the quality downgrades just a bit making things look a bit fuzzy. But honestly you forget about it after using it past 2 minutes! It's honestly mind-blowing how the system operates and how much the thing made me move so much in such little time. Now it's unfortunate that I had to pay around $600+ for it due to high demand and limited supply, but it's a decision I made and I'm not regretting it. I got all the games I want to play and so much free time to play them all on my new VR. Now in terms of third party accessories you may find it difficult to decide what's best for you. There are a lot of things you need to be prepared for when purchasing the quest. It mostly has to do with whether or not you can afford the games you want to play after buying the oculus so keep that in mind. I recommend You go for ""Superhot"" and ""Vader Immortal"" (If you like swordplay), but what I don't recommend is Beat saber on the Oculus app you're better off buying it on steam so you can get that crisp quality and customize your game with new songs and stuff [you need an alternative quest link to play PC games]. Anyways I'm having a good time and I hope you do as well.

When I use the glitchy oculus app it says that cable that comes with the box won't take it to connect it to steam. Then it brings me to its shop trying to sell me the same cable i have for $100 dollars. Pfft, what a huge let down and waste of a huge portion of money.

It should last longer than 4 months. It hasnt hasn't even been used much in the last 4 months.So I dont know if this seller who sold me my product is selling defective/used products or whether is merely is an issue with the Oculus VR itself, but I would not recommend Odealsdaily, unless they agree to refund me or ship me a new set

I've tried a Windows Mixed Reality headset, then I tried Oculus Go. WMR is okay, not as sharp and detailed, and definitely not enough experiences, The Go was very good for entertainment. The Quest beats them hands down.Once you have the Oculus App, setup is very straightforward. The games and experiences can be a little costly, but if you pace yourself and budget them, then you'll be fine.Truly amazing!

My first VR equipment. I am very impressed. Although all of rhe games ja e too much of a lead-in story (in my opinion), this headset is wltruly a wonderful thing to have. Very overpriced at $700 when others are around $300-$400, but if you want VR you have to go with the best. And this is definitely the best. I give it 4 for the experienc but only 2 for the price.The movies are amazing. You feel like you are there.  A bit unnerving at first. But, oh what an experience.

So. I was hesitant to buy something so expensive like the oculus classes. My son has an Xbox and I thought why he shouldn’t need another video game is beyond me. However, I was incredibly surprised at how impressive the Oculus was. This is some next level gaming and the experience of being inside the VR is something my son absolutely loves. My son is 16 years old. For adults, you can watch movies and it makes you feel like you’re in an auditorium at the movie theater. Great product.

Thanks to Amazon and their great support team I was able to reach a resolution, the product is great and served its purpose and beyond the seller is unhelpful and rude. I hope many can enjoy the Meta (Oculus) product, try to purchase directly from Amazon bypassing these kinds of sellers that don't honour their commitments and waranties.Once again special thanks to the awesome AMAZON team that have supported me when I experienced issues with my Oculus.

The battery life is pathetic at best, barely lasts an hour before it shuts itself off. Then when you go to charge it, it only works half the time!!! I left it on the charger all night, next day I was exited to start playing games. NOPE! It decided that even though it was plugged in, it wasn't going to charge. At all. Plus the picture quality leaves much to be desired, I find myself constantly adjusting the headset and moving it in odd angles just to try and get rid of the fuzz and pixels. However I've never had a problem with the tracking or actual game play, everything is smooth sailing there... At least for now.

This is likely the best random expensive thing I have bought. Both me and my wife have been playing on it at least two times a week each. Bonus is it is way more active than a regular game console. Watching movies is cool, but wearing it long enough to watch a whole movie is a bit much though honestly.

This is an awesome addition to our household as everyone has enjoyed using it, it comes with all you need to start playing except and iPhone to start it up at first. The visuals are very real and I like just looking around the home space (ours is a geo dome in the mountains). My daughter can play a game with her friends while everyone is still at home. A great game for those cooped up and too isolated.

I rate this 5 stars for the product itself. I bought this for the Vader Immortal games and as soon as I got it I was addicted. I usually play it everyday for a couple of hours. My girlfriend loves it. My family loves it. It is so much fun and fun for parties and having friends over. My only problems are... 1) To cast what your seeing to a TV you have to get a Chromecast. You can do it through a phone but the phone usually can't handle it. It has to be a 3rd generation Chromecast at least which is about $35. 2) This seller sold it the cheapest which was $600. And that's for the 64gb. You can go to Oculus themselves and buy the 128gb for $100 less then that. So you pretty much are spending an extra $200 just to get it sooner. Was it worth it? Yes for sure if you have that kinda money. Otherwise get it from Oculus for $400 instead

This is an amazing piece of technology. VR has come a long way since the days of Nintendo’s Virtual Boy. I was skeptical about the experience this generation of VR would provide so it took a lot (primarily being stuck in my NYC apt during COVID-19 crisis) to pull the trigger. I’ve had it for two days now and I’m blown away! We’ll see how long this last but there’s plenty of content available. Seems like new games, applications, and experiences are added with regular frequency.  If you are considering purchasing a VR headset, I would highly recommend the Oculus Quest. I purchased the larger capacity model just so I wouldn’t have to delete purchases to create space.

I have both a Rift S and a Rift, and I purchased a Quest for 650$ with 50$ TAX. I should've stopped there. When I got my quest, I plugged in my USB 3.0 cable that Oculus ships with the rift, and I was unable to use Oculus link to access my PC games. I then bought a Anker USB 3.0 cable as recommended by Oculus themselves, and once again, no result. Then, as a last resort, I had a friend bring his Oculus Quest over, and I was able to get it to work instantly with the same setup. Upon further examination, I found the charging/link port was completely broken. I didn't pay 700$ for a ""new"" device, just for it to arrive completely useless. The box was intact, never opened since the factory packaging, and there was no damage to anything else. My assumption is the Quest was broken during testing. Absolutely ridiculous.

I used Samsung Gear for years with Galaxy s9+ and s10+. The quest has alot of great features adn bells and whistles. The games play amazingly and is super immersive. However, watching 3d high res video is awful. It chops and stutters. One google search will tell you that this is normal behavior as the Quest isnt capable of playing 5k. Having file stored locally or airstreaming from laptop makes no difference. I had no issues playing 5k and 6k videos on my 3 year old Gear. Will return.

Contacted seller since the device was not connecting to the computer even after testing three different NEW USB C cables, but no response. We returned defective device and received a refund less a restocking fee which translates to over $150 less than what we paid.We bought another Occulus direct from the manufacturer which did connect to the computer with the first cable we tested. Not only did we pay less when purchased from the manufacturer, we also received a working product.DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. Expect poor customer service because this third party vendor does not care if they sent a defective product. But they have no problem charging you a fee to return.

The oculus itself is a good product, although who ever handled my package did so in a bad way. The cardboard box itself was fine on the outside but the box the oculus was inside had been dropped. I wasn’t gunna be picky until I noticed that one of the button on my controller wasn’t working properly and the microphone didn’t work at all. And now I have to return it and probably wait to weeks for them to exchange it. When this shouldn’t of been an issue in the first place.
