Two young girls picked up the fruit; a strange door suddenly appears in front of Platinum and Ruby.

Platinum and Ruby wanted to try adventure and the two of them entered through the door.

Throughout the journey, Platinum ends up breaking up with Ruby and after a struggle they arrive at a place that seems like someone's laboratory where the whale shaped airship is stationed.

But Ruby arrived in the future laboratory where Platinum was present.

The airship was destroyed, and it was a laboratory that seemed to be no longer being used due to the absence of people.
