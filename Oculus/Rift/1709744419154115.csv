2022-05-28 15:18:23.566505,swissgamer,too short but enjoyable,I really enjoyed this game as long as it lasted. My only problem is that it was advertised to be somewhat long ( because it said it was going to be 4 times bigger) but i beat it in less than a hour. If you would like a short interactive experience with humor like rick and morty than go for it but don't expect it to be long.,"Dec 27, 2020 at 10:55 AM",4, 6,

2022-05-28 15:18:26.746001,taquitobuddy,Not for me but fans might enjoy,"First, this isn't much of a game, more like an experience or narrative with some light interactions.  Its missing many VR features (like snap turning, etc.).  However, fans of the humor style will probably enjoy it for a playthrough.  For most people I'd rate it a pass, fans of the show/style I'd rate it try it out on sale.","Feb 6, 2020 at 2:48 AM",2, 1,

I do know that there are some other secret levels, although you have to look up how to get to them. This game is only really for people who want to take time to get to know the game and find the numerous different ways to enter these secret levels.

Its an odd experience, a bit like a camel licking your brain when there is a gas leak in the room. You know you should get up and do something else but it all just feels  too good. If you dont have a camel handy then pick this sweet baby up and take your mind on the journey it deserves. For the sexy asking price this is a Must buy.

I would genuinely like to thank the developers for making the experience CROSS-BUY (You buy it on the Rift you get it free on the Quest & vice versa) So I can now melt my friends and family brains with this excellent experience on my new Quest! Thank you please.

2022-05-28 15:18:29.946441,gregh9195,"Unfortunately,does NOT meet expectations","From the makers of Rick and Morty Virtual Rick-ality, comes the most disappointing release since every new Call of Duty game! 

This game shares the same candid-style babbling humor of R&M, but lacks any real sort of structure. The humor while shares the same style, the jokes simply don't really have any meat to them. Scenes are very short and mildly entertaining but interaction is limited and overall kills the replay value. 

I don't remember how much I paid but I don't want to know because whatever the amount, I regret it. Doesn't even feel worth finishing the last 20% of easter eggs or whatever I missed.","Apr 4, 2019 at 3:21 AM",2, 8,

2022-05-28 15:18:33.111975,CyberDoomer,"Fun, but a pain with front facing.","First, what needs to be established. This is not a front facing game.
This game requires you, as far as I can tell, for you to interact with the world in full 360 degrees, and also spawns you with your orientation at random places.

This is fine if you have 3 senors, but if you have a two sensor front facing set up like me, the immersion is destroyed when your tracking goes bonkers.

I'm sure they'll fix this in the future, but as far as content...

Just... what in the F*** did I play? There was a scene where I was sexually arousing a skeleton xylophone, and one of the voices was (I think) summer's from Rick and Morty, so that image is now in my head. 

This is a weird game, and I've always enjoyed the usage of killing myself to progress in the game. However, the humor in this game is VERY Roiland. His voice, his humor, his art style, it's all in this game. If you're a rick and morty fan, you'll definitely enjoy this. I'm not, and I still found this game enjoyable. 

The $10 price tag I got for this from the sale is what I believe to be justified by it's parody on VR and ridiculous content.","Oct 19, 2018 at 9:46 AM",4, 47,"Hey there, thanks for the review.
If you do not have a roomscale setup, try sitting mode and orient/rotate yourself with the thumbsticks. This way you should have no problems playing the game in a comfortable manner.

2022-05-28 15:18:36.232628,megamiley,Could be fun if it wasn't for the bugs,"My first experience was horrible with this game, my charactrer was way up in the air making it physically impossible to reach the ""new game"" button. 

The game also claims to have ""Front facing"" support along with ""Sitting"" and ""Room Scale"" but the Front Facing option is nowhere to be found and I don't have a full room scale setup, because of that I either have to sit on a chair in the middle of the room (which has it's own issues) or be forced to play parts of the game backwards where my controllers aren't being tracked properly cauing motion sickness (why this game was developed to have the angle you face change constantly I have no idea..). 

As for the sitting method, when I sit down in my Front Facing setup room on my chair I often get the issue that the sensors don't pickup my controllers since my legs are in the way causing it to not properly track them (and I'm not going to re-run the entire setup every time I want to play just this game as this game is the only one with issues so far). I also have to press the ""Reset VR Positon"" button every single time I teleport to a new spot because I'm always thrown into a desk or something stupid like that..

I don't understand why they've made their VR experience so bad, all other games work immediatly but this one just doesn't, on Google people have said that you'd need to setup SteamVR first but even tough that should never be the case it also doesn't change anything.. If they fix the game I might give it another shot but right now I'm contemplating a refund because of these game breaking bugs..

Update:

The game did work somewhat after re-configuring my guardian system but it's still way to much focused on room-scale even though it says it has front facing support as well. Ended up buying a third sensor for my setup to get true room-scale (which I would have gotten eitherway) and now it works. Also I really like the zoo level, tough to get to but definitely worth it!","Jan 12, 2019 at 6:24 PM",3, 1,"Hey there megamiley, 
Sorry for the issues you encountered, I am not super sure what the root cause of those are but here are some tipps that might help you : 
- If you select sitting mode (which is intended for front facing setups) you can rotate your virtual self with the thumbsticks. Doing so you should not run into a situation where the controllers are not being tracked. 
- I know you not super keen on it, but I have to recommend calibrating your peripherals again and doing the good old setup once more.
