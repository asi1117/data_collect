But Frontier and Oculus aren't fixing the issue and I don't expect them to. It is amazing when it works and I love it.

The real(ness) is awesome, and i jumped and bought the oddysey in preorder to support the devs for keeping this awesome sim updated , But fortunately it comes a huge dissapointment for me , as im a VR Only player it was a huge drawback to release odyssey in 2D :)) :(
Not to mention the lots of bugs which before was good without them , and the biggest issue is the huge stutters close to surface :(( it is awfull
Unplayable at all , even with 2000,3000 series gtx cant handle so dont tell me frontier to reduce graphics or upgrade gpu as horizon with a gtx 1070 on ultra in vr it was flowing smooth everywhere even in big battles , so you should do something abaout as it looks that it is some bug affecting that huge stutter.

About the game update from oculus client is a pain in the @ss , 3 days i just installing installing , again over and over , neverending story never got to finishing its bugged the whole update process, not to talk about that its hardly with tricky to start the update from frontier launcher as its just has the option to close launcher , so i still hope that frontier will soon release VR support for odyssey and sorting out the bugs , specially the stutters.

Too much real life outside of this sim, for me to really give it the time it needs. You really do have to invest alot of time learning the controls and way the game works. Why couldn't the (continual) space travel be simpler?? Soe newer games like Discovering Space 2, are way simpler to control in the cockpit and just as engaging.

2022-05-28 12:44:43.537629,Arwkin,"IMHO, the best space flight game for VR","I've been playing Elite Dangerous since the first year it was released.  I've played it in VR on and off over the past 18 months.  (My total game time is over 2000 hours.)  I'm only going to review my VR experience, but I need to at least add that Elite Dangerous is not for everyone.  Even with the tutorials and ""newbie"" area, anticipate at least 25-50 hours of game play before ""getting into the groove.""   If you're still interested after hearing this, you may have ""the right stuff.""  

The official VR rating is ""intense"" but the only ""intense"" play I've encountered was during a very rough drive in my SRV one day.  A few VR options exist to reduce this kind of ""intensity.""  I now have those options enabled (!) and I haven't had a problem again.

I don't recommend trying to play this game with VR controllers. There are just too many controls. I suppose if you are very determined to use them, then install VoiceAttack which adds voice-activated commands and macros.   The best experience (IMHO) is to play using a HOTAS (e.g. ThrustMaster 16000M + TWCS Throttle) and use VoiceAttack.

The most clunky VR implementation (again IMHO) is with the galaxy and system maps. Maybe I'm more used to using my mouse when I'm not using VR, but navigating around the maps in VR feels cumbersome.

Final thoughts: Frontier recently announced their Odyssey expansion (release ETA is early 2021).  At this time it has been said VR will not initially be supported for it.   There are more details Frontier needs to reveal, but it can be safely assumed they aren't removing VR completely from the game. (that would be silly)  All we know at this time is that Odyssey is going to add first person shooter gameplay. (Honestly, at this time it isn't confirmed what else it adds.)   I personally will never attempt (again) to play a FPS combat game in VR.  I tried once and felt sick for several hours.

Don't let that distract you from what this game brings to VR.  The flight portion of this games is a must in VR.  The first person shooter aspect is not in VR but that doesn't mean that they won't bring that to the table at some point.  I would recommend this game to anyone who loves space and would like to explore it in VR.  There is plenty to do in the base game and the horizons DLC.

2022-05-28 12:44:46.632964,Eyoldaith,Very immersive,"+ The game looks amazing in VR and is highly immersive. Makes up 90-95% of my total VR playtime.
- Might as well be renamed to space grinding simulator.
+- Only sitting VR.

VR comfort:
While in space, the game is pretty mild since there isn't really much of a background, but when driving on the ground in an SRV it gets pretty intense.

Other notes: Would recommend running it with a dual joystick setup.
Odyssey will not have VR support while on foot when it's released, but is supposedly not removing VR support from current content. Would assume VR will still work as long as you select Horizons in the launcher.","Jun 17, 2020 at 10:27 PM",4, 9,

It is complicated to get the hang of, it is huge and deep, and a lot of fun.  I play it with an Xbox controller, and it works really well.

You'll hear a lot about an upcoming DLC that won't have VR support (at first) but this game has been around 5 years on flat screen without that DLC, since I'm new to this game I don't care about the DLC.

But it would be downright sleep inducing if you didn't have to actually pilot it. I recommend, but it's not really for casual gamers as the lack of instructions is very, very annoying.

2022-05-28 12:45:02.449750,DMC831,Great VR experience,"This can be a difficult game to recommend, since it's relatively niche, but if you're into flying a space ship at all and have a VR headset it's pretty much a must-buy.  

I've played since 2015, so I've accumulated various nitpicks over the years-- it's grindy (though much less grindy than it used to be), it takes time to learn for most folks (though they've really improved the new player experience), and there's always ""more"" ya want from the game and new features you'll want added (though it's been updated regularly and a big update is coming in 2020).  

Even with its flaws, it's an awesome game and the best ""space game"" available.  The flight model is terrific, great detail in the ships and how customizable they are, a wide range of activities, enormous scale with real-life-sized planets and a full 1:1 scale Milky Way, really fun combat... it's a game I'll take a few months off from and then jump right back in and play nonstop, and there's not really anything else that can compete with it in VR.

It goes on sale regularly and when it's on sale it's one of the best deals in all of gaming considering it's a VR title more than capable of giving you hundreds of hours of gameplay.  Some folks just ain't going to be into the pace of it, nor be willing to learn the basics in the first few hours, so I always recommend new players to watch unedited streams and whatnot so you get an idea of what it's like.  I mentioned before it's a full scale galaxy, and that is meant literally, so travel time can take a while in some situations (they're situations you can avoid though... you don't NEED to travel thousands of light years or out to that far flung station that takes an hour to get to if you don't want to).  

To me, it's a great mix of simulation and arcadey action.  Be sure to do the tutorials, the recently added new player experience stuff, get to a point where you can dock and undock easily enough (doesn't have to be perfect), and then just give everything a try.","Oct 2, 2019 at 5:18 PM",5, 14,

2022-05-28 12:45:11.912161,solohelion,One of a kind,"Elite Dangerous is not a casual game to play, at first. The controls are not obvious, and don't lend themselves very well to the touch controllers. There's a lot to learn, and even after becoming a ""Pioneer"" in exploration (a high rank), there are still things I haven't had time to figure out or master. There is a long way to go for me, yet!

Play this with your friends if you can. There's a lot of things which seem negative on the surface to say about Elite: it's best played with a HOTAS, it takes a while to figure out (and rebind) the controls and learn the game, it can feel like a grind when you're just trying to get the next bigger ship, and evidently the game doesn't support colossal pvp space battles like EVE due to networking architecture, and those things are all somewhat true.

However, there is no other game or experience quite like Elite Dangerous. The only two games in the same category are No Man's Sky and Star Citizen, neither of which support VR at the time of this review. Elite Dangerous is quite a bit different than both. It's a MMORPG with a community and missions to complete. But it can be played in ""Solo"" mode, which hides other human players from directly interacting with you.

Elite spaceships are a pleasure to maneouver with a HOTAS, unlike Star Citizen spaceships, which are designed with keyboard and mouse in mind at the expense of the HOTAS (to date). There's really nothing else like Elite. If you want an enormous game to fly a spaceship around, in VR, it's pretty much the only one.

I've played other VR space games which are much better for casual gaming. House of the Dying Sun is phenomenal with an X-Box controller (or touch controllers), and is a dogfighting game. Depending on your preferred control system (HOTAS or controller), mileage varies for different games. But all the other VR space games are more arena fighter games (which you can do in Elite, although it is complicated in Elite).","Jul 22, 2019 at 4:21 PM",5, 5,

Game continues its slow death by bugs and indifference. You'll think the game is amazing for a few months as you learn and buy skins. However, then it will become a dull painful grind and you'll regret spending a dime. See, you become a cost center after this time and it seems the bugs and new features are designed to drive you away:-(  They report they'll be moving to new paid content and, maybe, this will force the developers to deliver on their promises. until then, buyer beware. It's gonna get dull.



This is an amazing game. When it works. The latest update has caused network drops to occur at random. Sometimes the game will play perfect for an hour. Other times, you are dropped by the game servers and bounced to your start menu with every jump. If you've not experienced the game prior to the last update you will very likely regret this purchase. Frontier, the devs, has not been forthcoming on cases opened by players nor provided any information on there forums. If you still need more info in making your decision, seach for the frontier development forums and reddit and verify for your self. 

Should frontier update their user base as to why this is happening I'll update this review another star. I'd offer up more stars for fixing it but am rapidily losing faith in the company and figure ""what's the point?"".

My only beef with the game is … WHERE IN THE HELL IS EVERYONE?!? Its so lonely. Seems for new players you only interact with Npc's and unless you know anyone else who plays its gonna be like that. 

There needs to be ways to communicate with the community in game. It would be nice to implement a way to talk or locate other players who are in the same system as you. An open space chat If you would like calling it that. Just something...... its sooooo cold out here in space. Needs human interaction","May 4, 2019 at 9:49 AM",4, 23,

2022-05-28 12:45:18.242449,thesmith_de,,"You have to consider some things before buying this:
1. You have to be aware, that you will defenetly be frustrated in the beginning due to controlls!!! They are over complicated. If playing this with oculus touch (like me) you MUST change some controls in the options menu to get it running properly! The tutorial helps some, but is not enough either. In the beginning I had to quit several times and google some problems i had. Learning curve is tough...
2. AND, you will defenetly be frustrated in the beginning due to the missions as well!!! Explanations are poor and trial and error occurs often. Experience is the key and i recommend to accept the missions acording to the commanders level. Learning curve is tough...
3. You will never, ever in your entire life experience all, this game offers! The game map (if you can call it like that) is simply our entire galaxy!!! Everything you do, has an effect on the entire system in some way, but what is one humen in a universe with billion of stars, planets, npc's and other players. You feel important at first with the biggest ship under you command, but in fact you are a nothing! You might feel unimportant after a while.

So why 5 stars?
1. This is the mother-of-all of the open world! You can travel wherever you want. You can do whatever you want. You can set you own goals and fulfil your dreams.
2. This is the real galaxy, the one we live in. Somehow you feel home, even though in real life theres no such thing like space travel. But you find places thinking ""i heard or read about this"" and even though its only in the game, it gives you some kind of satisfaction.
3. Theres so much you can do. You can trade, deliver goods, be a courier, scavenge, mine, head hunt, steal, hack, retrieve, explore, construct, loot, raid, transport passengers or simply fly around and visit places.
4. The VR experience is awesome. Space travel in 3D:  OMFG!!!
5. For an elite veteran like me (since C64!) its a dream come true!!! An absolute must buy!","Apr 20, 2019 at 1:07 AM",5, 26,

The touch controls only act a a gamepad instead of tracked motion controllers. I would give this game a higher review if they fixed that. Also I find the various screens constantly get in the way as they lock controls when looked at. Those two things alone makes this game not worth the price.

There are a lot of good things to say about this game. It has a massive galaxy, making money to buy better ships and upgrades is fairly simple, you can explore some planetary surfaces with your  SRV (hopefully it opens up to more planets as some look really neat). There are a large variety of stations and ships out there, I personally really loved actually flying into a station and docking manually at a launch pad. Found that to be a really nice feature. The systems do not feel like copy and paste systems, each certainly seem different and very large. The distance between objects is better then I would expect, certainly takes time to get around (which to me is a great feature). There is a choice to opt out of the multiplayer galaxy, but it wouldn't matter as its hard to find other players anyway. Not sure where they're all hiding.

Talking in this game is something I can't seem to figure out in VR. The game features a standard ingame chat system, VR users typically don't use a keyboard for communication. There is suppose to be a voice chat system, but I can't find any players to test that with yet, so.... On the plus side, you can play off the oculus store in standard desktop mode, but why buy a VR game that doesn't properly support VR? Hopefully the issues I've mentioned get fixed and I can give it a higher review. Right now if they just give it better VR support I would be happy.

If you're looking to buy this, I would wait until it went on sale.","May 14, 2019 at 12:59 PM",3, 3,

2022-05-28 12:45:27.703754,norsoulnet,"Best game in VR, best Space Sim game","Elite Dangerous by itself, outside of VR, is a very good game (4/5 Stars).  It is by far the best space sim on the market in that regard.  It has a very steep learning curve with a minimal tutorial (including tutorial videos and familiarization missions with scripted voiceovers).  It has a vast library of youtube videos and a dedicated community.  

It is space flight simulator style game that takes liberties with physics to make the game fun and playable (i.e. ships have a maximum speed in space, but that prevents space battles from happening at tens of thousands of meters per second and across huge distances by radar only).

There are no space legs like in No Man's Sky or Star Citizen, which keeps the user experience tighter and more streamlined.  The flight model and combat is second to none (less visceral than EVE Valkyrie but far more complex).  The ships and weapons are all well balanced.

The game is more than combat, however, as you can choose to explore the galaxy (a 1:1 simulation of the Milky Way, with distances faithfully re-created where possible), smuggle illegal goods, trade goods between systems with complementary economies (i.e. make a profit by hauling ore from an extraction economy system to an industrial economy).  With regards to exploration, no other game comes even close to Elite Dangerous.

Missions are randomly generated and generally un-inspiring.  Underlying game mechanics (called the Background Simulation, as factions vye for power over star systems) are needlessly complex.

This game is a game changer in VR.  Ship sizes come to life as you suddenly realize just how HUGE your ship is!  The largest flying ships are larger than modern nuclear submarines.  Outside of VR everything is shrunk down to fit into your screen, but in VR you are engulfed by your cockpit, which is a tiny window on a huge ship.  Planets and stars will bring tears to your eyes in VR.  I bought the Oculus for this game, and don't regret it one bit.  Worth every dollar.","Jan 16, 2019 at 10:38 AM",5, 47,

I've studied the .binds xml files until I can just about recite them from memory.  I've updated drivers for the controller and done my best to find workable bindings on the internet.  When I'm prompted in the training missions, for example, to deplay hard points, the control I have programmed does nothing.  Even the keystroke (""U"") doesn't work.  Just flying around and docking works just fine, but trying to do anything more seems impossible.  I've worked so hard on it that I'm worn out.

Couldnt even get passed the training because of controls being over complicated and limited with touch. i thought it was gonna be like ST bridged crew where you can actually move your hands around and access all the controls need to play.....nope...nope nope.....not like that. bottom line unless a thorough tutorial is created to optimize my touch controllers to play this game in a smooth fashion (without having to take my headset off to press keys breaking my immersion), this game rest in the unplayable section for me :( theres dark souls 3 hard, theres ""getting over It"" hard.....then theres ""learn curve BS E.D."" ridiculous. you make me sad >:( bottom line 2 stars for game performance and graphics, really nice.

now 5 stars
If you got this far, this is an update two days after i posted the first paragraph. learning curve is steep, but this game became worth it. im switching my review to five stars because this game has rightfully earned it. To help you get passed the learning curve, few things to keep in mind: Keyboard and mouse (with VR headset) works way better than oculus touch and doesnt break immersion, if your keybinding doesnt ""bind' when you're setting up comfortable controls try to set the keybinds in the second slot option instead of the first. if you are having trouble really starting off, find a mentor in the game, you just need to press ''2' to open up chat, scroll down and join another ship with experienced people. lastly, power through the control adjustiong and learning, this game gets really good.

oh yeah pro tip: take advantage of your shift keys, it can be really useful for combo keybindings like (SHIFT+W) is my 100% throttle) while just W is forward throttle. things like that make the game sweet as pie. crazy first day playing i wouldnt buy this game on sale, 2 days later im glad to pay full price.","Feb 11, 2019 at 5:24 PM",5, 6,

Cons: 
Always (almost without fail) have problems installing updates .
Can be a little boring if you are constantly just flying around and are not in the game with real players.
Each update brings its own extra problems (at this moment disconnects randomly).

We have come a long way since Wing Commander :) 

Learning curve is steap, but setting up my x52 was a walk in the park, compared to EVE: Valkyrie. Also, this game is a lot less shooting at everything that moves and much more of a proper space simulator.

I can't believe the scale of this game, and the depth. Like some people say: It's the Milky Way, in full 1:1 scale, and that should be more than enough. You still have to hyperjump between starts, and JUST WOW!!! the first time you do that :)

Being an amateur astronomer: The attention to astronomy details are just mindblowing. The first time I entered the Galaxy Map, and noticed the Horsehead Nebula and stars I knew, was awesome. Kind of like being at home, but far far away. The graphics are a lot less Avatar style than No Mans Sky, and much more realistic. Proper colors and red nebula, thanks.

The first time I saw Jupiters rings for real through a large telescope, my heart jumped. I had the same feeling in Elite Dangerous the first time I recogniced Bernards Loop in the distance, while approaching some minor spacedock in the middle of nowhere, delivering two boxes of beer to some miners.

Take your spaceship and look a litte closer on what the different stars are like up close. Don't get too close though, as this will fry your equipment quickly!

A can highly recommend this game. Thanks to the developers for an excellent job!

To newcomers like me: Start in Solo mode AFTER doing the Training Missions. Fly around, don't start fights (hehe) and do some transport missions to get into the spirit of being a Space Commander. I have only experienced fighting, when I occasionally bounty hunted, and it seems that you can get along with most spaceships you meet.","Jan 24, 2019 at 9:31 PM",5, 9,

- You will Love this more if you are a fan of Si-Fi themes and atronomy! 
-A joystick of sorts is recommened (I use the X52 Myself) for maximum comfort and performance!
-The game can be very daunting when you start! I was not joking about the content, if you try it all at once your head will explode!!! :D

It is very hard to learn, since everything you could do ingame isnt explained anywhere ingame. You have to know a veteran player who can be your mentor or you need to watch youtube-tutorials for everything you want to do ingame. Figuring out yourself will take like forever and is not worth it. Just go for some guides online and you can master this game.

Also there are some aspects in this game like trading that (at the moment) rely way too much on thrid party websites to be effective ingame. At some points, you just miss some informations ingame like easily accessible live market data and where to get your ships and ship components or materials you need for engineering and crafting. Finding POI on planets is MUCH better since the last update. Before, you HAD to use 3rd party websites to find stuff on planets.

However, the game has some drawbacks regarding touch controller input: For some reason the game does not let you setup a completely working touch controller contolset ingame. Sometimes it displays ""Right X Axis + is already used for ..."" but in fact the bindings could never collide since you are using them for two totally different game modes. Best example is SRV (ground vehicle) controls vs Ship controls. Some ship controls prevent you from setting the same button for your SRV controls. BUT if you take your time and edit the binds-config-file manually in a text editor like Notepad++ then you are able to setup everything you want. It takes some time but with this option you are able to bind EVERY function that is important to your touch controllers. You can always use key-combos like ""A"" + ""left analog up"" or ""left grip + right grip"" etc. You will need time to get used to your controls, but when you do, the game is playable with touch controllers without issues and you can enjoy the full oculus experience.","Dec 20, 2018 at 12:41 AM",4, 2,

Elite Dangerous has a very rich lore to go with the game that just keeps getting better.  Start small and go big. Unlimited game play with hundreds of billions of worlds to visit.  Customise your ships with many upgrades.  I personally think it works best with a HOTAS, but you can still play with the keyboard and mouse very easily.  All controls are programable to your choice.  Game does have a learning curve, just like learning to drive a car or truck.","Nov 9, 2018 at 7:08 PM",5, 21,

Combat needs to be tuned, flight is way to rough and uncordinated. Endspace runs a 1000X better than this game and the tracking system with the headset is never as bad as this game. Doesn't matter if I recalibrate my sensors to a sitting position, I basically am either sitting behind the cockpit or inside front console. I don't have any of these problems with any other games. This game is not ready for VR. It's not much better on the console either.

2022-05-28 12:45:43.469748,GenIdea,Looks great in VR but ...,"I'm a great fan of Elite Dangerous as a game, it looks amazing.

That look is maintained in the VR albait in a bit lower detail, but the feeling of being in the envionment not just looking at it is astounding.
But ...
There are a few gremlims that make the VR experience a bit of a pain to play.

It has a steep learning curve, there are many controls.  These can however all be mapped to a joystick or gamepad of your choice. 
There is no support for Touch controllers :(  (I hope Yet!) 
(I've read in other reviews that you can use the controllers like a gamepad. That's good to know, it'll get you started with ED in VR)

Note that the galaxy and system maps are a bit of a letdown, while looking good, are almost unusable.  I'm sure with some key bindings they can be made to do something, but realistically I plot routes in 2D mode and the switch to VR to actually fly (this is actually quite easy and can be done while in game)

Be warned, this game can make you motion sick,  in particular driving the moon-buggy.  There are a few settings to help reduce this, but it might be an issue.

IMO You will NEED a HOTAS type of joystick/thottle control with a reasonable number of buttons to program for all the main flying functions. keyboard and mouse won't cut it.

One additional point to note, game is still being developed actively so things will get better I am sure .. If you want a complex space simulator game then i'd say buy it!","Oct 13, 2018 at 8:55 PM",3, 17,

It is the biggest MMO in the world, because everyone is playing it in one universe - our universe. You can travel around and feel absolutely free. Everyone is talking abount how complicate it is, but I've played it in VR ever since and it is wonderful. Some changes of the keyboard to my needs, so I can reach all without looking at it, and the rest I can do it with the virtual menues in my ship - of course in 3D. 
It is the best to fly around - have a look to out Saturn Rings and fly through it. Every time a must see. When you jump to the next star you feel the heat coming from it - did you every visit one of the largest stars - the beetlegeuce?! Fantastic. It has LV426 in it (with another name) and Quasars and Black Holes and so many more. 
Driving on a planed you just landed is always astonishing. Every time you seemlessly land from the space in one hell of a crater it makes you feel so tiny.
Go get the game and play it for hunderet of hours (I have about 300 and can't stop). Play with others - no not just shooting at them - really play with them.  Go join the fuel rats or just explore or hunt or trade or ... just have fun.","Feb 13, 2019 at 8:41 AM",5, 3,

Hundereds of millions of starsystems with planets and moons to land on and drive arround in your SRV,or to fly through in your fighter in deep canynons.. fight, trade, mine, do missions for one of the factions or just explore the vastness of space.

I'm a first time Elite Dangerous player and have only played it in vr. I use only Touch controllers which is awesome after learning all the ""keybindings"". I suspect it will be much easier to make fine movements in a battle scenario, since the small stick on touch controllers make it a bit challenging to target the enemy without doing it automatically. Even though I don't use HOTAS yet I still play whenever I have spare time for it.

Now I will emphasize this fact, this is not a game for a casual gamer!  If you just want to get into a spaceship and blow things up, and not care about everything else that goes into living in space, or flying a spaceship, then this is not the game for you.  This is the game for all of us that want to really go into space and get into the real nitty gritty nasty details of really being there and not having some pre-programmed set path that we must follow in order to ""Progress"" through a spoon fed linear game.   There are no instructions on how to play.  You learn it as you go.  Nobody is going to tell you what to do, that is what you are supposed to decide.   You want to go bounty hunting?  Go for it.  Want to become a miner taking resources from the rings of a planet, or far flung asteroids?  Go for it.   Want to be a rebel and transport illegal slaves into a star port under silence and not get caught?  You can do that too.    If you want to be like me and spend months on end (real time not game time by the way) traveling to the opposite side of the Galaxy, can you say Beagle Point, you can even do that too.   It is all up to you.    This is, I repeat not a game for the casual player.  This is the game for the dedicated soul who is not afraid to put blood sweat and tears into exploring and living in space.   

(By the way, if you really want to get the most out of this game and feel that you are there, I cannot emphasize how good this game is in Virtual Reality, with a HOTAS Joystick setup with Voice Attack running in the background taking your audible commands.

Although, the game itself is very solid with incredible graphics and an amazing soundtrack, meanwhile providing plenty to keep you entertained for a long time, it does lack a few social aspects for an mmo.

As close to living in ""The Expanse"" as I will ever get.   

Now for those who are complaining or lost: 
Read the online/downloadable manual, google your questions, or go to youtube. There are a ton of online resources.  This is a simulation not an arcade game and it has an initial very steep learning curve - which is well worth it once you put in the effort.  Definitely use VoiceAttack. Makes it much easier and more immersive.  For example I have the key bind for reseting the view setup in VoiceAttack.  To fix my view at any time I just say ""Reset"".  To open the comms panel I say ""Communications"".  Same with dealing with landing gear, cargo scoop, external lights, weapons, supercruise, etc. Get VoiceAttack and learn how to use it.

Now let's address some of these 1-2 star reviews that don't actually review the game itself, but instead review their own technical abilities / problematic operating system or simple lack of information. 

First off, make no mistake! this isn't a ""VR expericence"" (well ofc it is, but using that term kinda makes me think you're trying to put it on the same page as watching dolphins swim underwater in your VR headset...). 
It's also not a 'demo' or a quick casual arcade something... that the store is full of.. This is a full blown triple-A game! One of the few that has added VR support as an additional layer of immersion, but it holds its own even without VR. (in other words, a game that was actually developed AS a game and not as a ""VR experience"" - much like Fallout 4.. Skyrim.. etc are all very nice standalone games and you cannot compare them ""value""-wise even to the best of the VR arcades like Robo Recall or whatnot since they're simply... not even in the same galaxy - pun intended).

So based on the above, set your expectations accordingly.. This is not something you start from your Oculus dash and casually wave your touch controllers for 10-20 minutes then go and do something else. This is a new hobby that you're picking up that will provide you with thousands of hours of entertainment. 

 - Yes, you need a Frontier account to play, since this is a MMO simulation (it has Open / Solo / Private group modes to filter the amount of people you interact with, but there's a single shared galaxy so all your interactions transfer across modes)
 - The Login button is a giant orange button on the launcher desktop app itself that opens when you start the game (don't try to find it in VR, not there!)
 - pressing F12 on the keyboard recenters your head ingame so no need to use the Oculus button
 - You need an xbox controller / Joystick to play properly","Mar 25, 2018 at 9:14 AM",5, 34,

1) Someone who didn't take the time set up their controls properly
2) Someone who didn't take the time to figure out how to recenter their VR 
3) Someone who didn't take the time to look up... whatever.

Yes, there will be a steep learning curve.
Yes, there will be some effort involved figuring things out.
Yes, you will be frustrated trying to figure out how to control the game in VR, regardless of your method of control.
and Yes, there are plenty of resources out there to help you along the way.

Now, if you can get through the pain of getting things set up, you are in for the best VR experience out there, period.  
-Total freedom to explore the Milky Way, from our own solar system to a jaunt from Sagittarius A* (the super-massive black hole at the center). 
-Total freedom to be a trader, miner, bounty hunter, explorer, and any combination between. 
-Total freedom to fly a small ship, a large ship or a medium ship at your whim and desire, and equip each ship to fill any of the roles above.

As long as you are willing to put in the time.

Recommendations: 
-A HOTAS (Hand-On Throttle And Stick) is highly recommended as the number of controls you will need at your finger tips is rather numerous.
-Linking your ED account to the various third-party sites out there (helps with planning and ship configuration.
-Joining a Wing of like-minded people who can help you along in the game (gaining credits or doing missions together.. what have you) makes the game more enjoyable.
-Voice Attack (third party voice command software) to assist with common controls and tasks.

I invested $200 above and beyond the cost of the game, but you can spend much less than I did to have the same experience.... and it was an investment (HOTAS can be used with other programs as well, and that was $150 of the $200 for me as I got a better-than-average setup).

The universe you play in is the computer (PC/Mac) universe, so even if your friends don't have an Oculus, you can still play with them. 

I play with my Oculus touch controllers and Voice Attack with Orion (William Shatner's voice). It took a while to set up the controllers with key bindings that worked for me, but once I figured it out, the game becomes immersive. Excellent game.","Mar 19, 2018 at 7:53 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 12:46:08.809110,Arguyle,Best space immersion,"The best space immersion ever, period. Just make sure you have a joystick to fully enjoy this game. Touch controllers and XONE controllers cannot beat (by far) the accuracy of a joystick. Keep in mind its a simulation, so the learning curve is extremely steep. Once you have mastered the controls (give it a few hours of training), this game can give hundreds if not thousands of hours of pure sci-fi excitement. From a non sci-fi fan.

If you want to push your immersion further more, combine this game with Voice Attack and GameMusicPack. With voice commands you get to perform all actions that would be otherwise binded all over your keyboard even if you have a joystick, and you have a computer responding back to you with over 2000+ answers, including educational stuff and proactive relevant interactions. Combine this with epic contextual music which gets triggered by your actions/events.
That is the summum of space immersion.","Mar 5, 2018 at 1:41 AM",5, 13,

The VR experience is exceptional, no doubt about that but the game itself is very boring and repetitive. You just go from one place to another, doing the same stuff over and over again.

I really dislike being forced to apply a giant 10+ GB patch I don't want - I play singleplayer only, everything was working perfectly using super sampling 2.0 before the patch (note the game would not start if if wasn't patched). I'm running the game on a GTX 1080 (oc 2100 Mhz boost, 11 Ghz ram), i7 7700K (4.5 Ghz), 16GB 3200 MHz DDR4 and Win10. ""If it works don't fix it"", sigh... I've changed Nvidia driver from 391.35 to the good old 385.28 - it has helped a bit, but performance is still far from optimal.
Furthermore now there's no sound in the HMD headphones - to fix this I had to remove my HMD and set the Rift headphones as the primary audio device in Windows. I've got perfect sound in all my other Rift games without having to do this. 
Unless you're a great fan of Elite, I'd skip this game in it's current state (v. 3.0.5), you'll need a lot of patience to enjoy this game.

These reviewers must remember the game is NOT developed as, but rather built to support, a virtual reality environment. Once you set up your HOTAS, gamepad, or whichever controller you're going to use, you rely on your sense of touch to navigate your controls. I bought a PS4 Thrustmaster HOTAS for this game and while I find myself having to remap keys occasionally (I don't have to take off my headset to use the mouse...), it's really a minor inconvenience for a game not built for VR.

Elite Dangerous is absolutely stunning. I have never felt so small and insignificant in my life until jumping to another star system for a basic mission, or scrolling out of the galactic map to see where we are in the galaxy. It's a surreal feeling that really put life into perspective for me.

This is a simulator, not an arcade game. There is no hand holding, storyline, or guided missions. You choose what you want to do; Mining, trading, piracy, combat, bounty hunting, transport missions (cargo/personnel), planetary exploration in a land rover, and much more. You will find yourself, at first, looking up a lot of information and frustratingly removing your headset, but once you get the feel for it and understand your controls and mission objectives, you will have the headset on for four hours straight and forget you're a real person sitting in a gaming chair with drool coming out of your mouth (South Park, anyone?)

It's absolutely worth a good solid attempt if simulation is  your thing. If you're looking for an arcade space game, move on. Removing your headset to learn the game? I got 99 problems but learning how to play a game for the ultimate immersive experience ain't one!","Mar 15, 2018 at 1:00 PM",5, 12,

For the record, I do like this game, but I can see why a lot of folks would not. To start, a steep learning curve and the training missions are harder than what you can expect right out the gate, but necessary for familiarization and even as refreshers. Once you get a handle on things and start your first flight the euphoria, and confusion, of freedom sets in. Then you learn a mistake the hard way and eject. Then you learn more the hard way. Wash, rinse, repeat until you have a good solid grasp on what to do and even then you can get too comfortable/cocky. There is a very good chance to get bored and move on, but luckily you can just change your mode of play. You were a trader? Buy a fighter and start hunting bounties. Run a taxi service. Become a pirate. The fact that it's open ended will always give a reason for ""just one more mission,"" but I can see where it would lose the appeal to do so especially once the grind for credits or rank sets in. That said, I have to say just the atmosphere itself in VR is enough to give this game a try.

Yes a joystick is recommended, and any other controllers you'd like. If you're not already experienced at this sort of thing, you may struggle to set up controls well, but it's worth the effort -- and not just for major gamers; Elite is not just a gamer's game any more; I'd recommend it to pretty much anyone. If joysticks look expensive to you, then look again for ones without 'force feedback' as they're much much cheaper, for not much cost in gameplay. (Controllers without force feedback ARE still SPRUNG.)
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Looking at prices for brand-new, in 2018, it looks like 4 analogue axes on 1 stick is not unusual, if spending about £30 or more ($40 or more). Spend a little to become octopus-like at multitasking. (Real profits come from silly rumbling gizmos... ...and, I suppose, from genuinely good force feedback setups. Spend at your discretion.)

There are other workarounds for creative people with many controllers but no one good joystick. Yay, just found old joystick to add to my modern one. **Update coming on that, wheel&peddles, drums&ped, GH2 guitar... Then the PS3 controllers... Just to push it.**

Try what champions of another game, Descent, tend to use: joyX=roll, joyY=pitch, twist=yaw. 'Groundpounders', used to mouselooking in an FPS, often prefer: joyX=yaw, joyY=pitch (inverted), twist=roll. Each is logically consistent. The first is a more direct translation between ship and joystick. Both win plenty, at online Descent. Explode y'all later folks :)","Feb 3, 2018 at 10:07 AM",5, 5,

If you use Touch, which comes with every new Rift, then you start each game looking through the floor while the game menu floats above your head.  Elite doesn't detect that anything is wrong, instead you have to Google the solution, and you find out that you need to press F12 each and every time you start the game.

Text is blurry, and the comms panel is very difficult to read. When viewing mission boards, the load time becomes frustrating because you can't look at anything but that loading screen.  Why these aren't loaded behind the scenes when you dock, I have no idea.

The game will not adapt its graphics to keep a constant 90fps, instead you have to manually adjust graphics settings if your GPU isn't keeping up.  Not even the ""VR"" graphics settings do this.

Aside from the VR aspects, Elite feels very much like an MMO with many of the appealing aspects removed.  There is no in-game story to speak of.

For the best gameplay you do need HOTAS system but it can be played with a normal joystick and the X-box controller. Another option to make it even better is a third party voice control program.

A tip - to make reading game menu text a little clearer; and to get a sharper picture, on the game video settings turn up Super Sampling and HDR a bit, keep changing and checking. If it gets laggy (as in side views get choppy) turn one or the other down a notch. On my 1080Gtx I have SS on 1.50 and HDR on 1.75. Much better all round picture quality and I can now read the text easier. 

PC version -  you can change your cockpit colours, go and google how, pick a nice dark green or purple base colour set, much better in VR than the standard cockpit colours.

Not at all beginer friendly and that is honestly what makes it amazing. Once you get past the initial phase of running into everything and making every mistake possible, you'll find yourself doing things that are amazing, and discovering new mistakes you didn't think were possible.

I had to look at the settings to find out which keys are supposed to perform what functions. If I hold my head back far enough, a couple of keys work to increase and decrease the throttle, that's all I can do. If I'm not careful, I wind up accidentally navigating some menu way off to the left with unreadable text. Is this supposed to be a game, or a pre-alpha tech demo? Even registration is a terrible, difficult experience. Maybe controls work better on a gamepad? Still wouldn't be able to sit in front of my computer and play it.

You should only need to reach out to touch a button to access the mission log, or start a way point path. Instead you are moving around menus by pressing buttons. Not all together bad. I was okay with it until I found that the Galaxy menu, had not been configured properly. Some buttons were double bound, causing an inability to use the whole menu. Aside from looking around in space. Which is indeed beautiful by the way. And the issue is easy to fix. And if you find it difficult, there are forums online that have many posts with fixes.

Yes, it is a complicated, yes it will take time to learn and yes you will get frustrated many times. Do the training missions and it will teach you basics and you are good to go. Rest is like any other complex game, you will have to figure out by trial and error or online guides. It does come with a long manual if you want to read it. Game pad (like xBox controller) is a must! I did not have to change controller key binds at all. It was key bound perfectly. I started playing in VR but then went to desktop mode to learn a few things. Once I got the hang of it I went back to VR mode and having a LOTs of fun. Play it in whichever mode you like, it is a great game. Got it during winter sale and I have already put in 60+ hours. Oh and buy a docking computer! It will make things much faster but make sure you do that after you learn manual docking, otherwise you will be in trouble if you don’t know how to manually dock and your docking computer is damaged and not working. Highly recommend this game to anyone who likes futuristic space based combat/trading simulator. 
In a way, it is similar to eve online but in the pilot seat not a top down view and solo mode if you don’t want to pvp. Also, if your ship gets destroyed then it is gone for good so pick your fights wisely! Insurance dose cover most of the cost but it is not a free respawn like other games if you die.

If so, steer clear of this timesink of a game because it will deeply impact you IRL. The game itself is beautiful, but it has one feature that drove me (a busy dad) totally nuts--the missions have a timer. Not an in-game timer, an IRL timer. The mission timer doesn't pause when you log out...it keeps ticking while I go to work, go out with my wife, play with my kids. You lose the mission and often some prestige if the timer runs out. Why Frontier did this is beyond me. It is completely annoying to anyone who has a normal life. For example, I am trying to complete a mission that is taking awhile and I realize that I need to get to bed so I can go to work the next day without being a zombie. However, I also realize that, if I log out, I will not have time to complete the mission at work so I am forced to stay up much later than desired just to complete the mission before the IRL mission timer runs out. It's a time pressure that is absolutely not needed and I wish Frontier would fix this problem. If they did, my rating would jump to 4 stars. If you have all the time in the world with no IRL pressures, you will probably enjoy this game.

As to the game itself, its Elite - long, lacking any real purpose or story line, annoying and wonderful at the same time. I don't have that ability I had all those years ago to sit there for hours just wandering around in space but I do enjoy the odd VR blast these days.","Nov 30, 2017 at 10:42 PM",4, 7,

And for most of it.. I was mind numbingly bored playing only to pass the time.I have tried to like this game, I REALLY tried.
This is a wonderful tech demo, but it is FAR from a game. Its a slow mind-numbing experience of poorly mixed game mechanics with hundreds of hours of tedium in between rare moments of fun.
My advice, Just watch other players condensed videos on youtube, its a far more enjoyable experience. Let some one else spend weeks at a time grinding resources and entire weeks flying to out of the way systems chasing what little content the game actually offers.
Elite is technically impressive but utterly lacks soul or anything to drive a player beyond the acquisition of credits.
In open, you are forever at the mercy of the meta player. Three times, I have built a ship to what I thought was a decent level, only to be killed in seconds when I dared to play in open by a sealclubber with an ""engineered"" ship which while the same model as min can easily have 5x the firepower of my modest craft.
Now more than ever the game discourages the new player. The rewards are thin, while the risks are immense. The only solution to this is to play in solo, and take the shallow experience for what it is.
There is no point to most of the community goals, the ""story"" takes place outside of the game. Seriously, when I criticised the lack of meaningful content I was told to read the Reddit as that's where the story is... The reddit... seriously... I should not have to trawl the internet in order to try and find some measure of value from this game.
The final issue I have is the lack of progress. This game is very much still the same beta level product i purchased almost 3 years ago.

Yes, you can get a HOTAS and it's an amazing experience.

I really enjoy this game with Touch controllers.  yes, there is a learning curve on this game as there are a lot of functions you can do whilst inside the cockpit.  However, a few training missions and you're good to go.  ED in VR is AMAZING and the computer version ain't got NOTHING on it. Thanks Frontier for this amazing game.
UPDATE: Ok, Frontier and Oculus really do need to do better at communicating. Last time, Oculust puts out a client update and it breaks the Touch controllers in ED.  This time, ED puts out the 2.4 patch update and now the Oculus client won't take the update.  Says my Antivirus won't allow update but I don't have antivirus installed.

I just do not quite know what to do? right not it just seems like more of a experience then a game.  Is there a story or path i should be following? The game just kinda dumped me in space with minimal information.

* edit after a weekend playing i figured it all out. With help from Discord server and some research. Its a bit more fun now. Although a bit more story would be nice. ;) 

:Edit 2 --I enjoy the game. I play in VR. Downloaded on Oculus.  It is rather tedious and boring at times and has no story but its fun to chill out. It is basically a game for old space nerds. 

That said The cash shop gotta go. The game cost me 70 bucks Canadian for the stand alone version and Horizons.  Their is no place for microtransactions in a game this expensive. Sorry but that is just greedy. Paint jobs should be free. As matter of fact i will go out on a limb and say that we should be able to create our own paint jobs. I want a cool looking ship and i feel like after paying 80 bucks i deserve one.  

I expect a cash shop in a free game with the argument that the devs need to make money to. but that crap don't fly in a game that costs this much and has expansions that we gotta buy. It is really a slap in the face to the end user. At the very least we should be able to unlock all that cool stuff in game somehow. 

Gotta give the overall game 5 out of 10. I do enjoy it and recomend it to space enthusiasts, especially if you have vr but the cash shop pisses me off to no end. It should not be in the game. Games to pricey to justify having one. If you can get the game on sale go for it but at full price its a bit much to stomach for what the game is..","Oct 21, 2017 at 2:34 AM",3, 14,

In VR this game is rly only playable with flight stick and furthermore the cash shop  is pretty hard for a 50 euro game.

BUT if you spend some money for a flightstick and invest (some) time to set everything up properly this game can be really stunning and probably earns the best vr title so far cuz of its depth and beauty!There are soo many things to do in this game but so little time XD

2022-05-28 12:47:12.234242,0dysseus,Elite 1984 brought present day,"in VR things are different to Monitor play - ship scale is perhaps the most notable and spatial movement.
I don't understand the ""unplayable in VR"" performance reviews - if your sys meets min spec advised by Frontier Dev then there really shouldn't be ANY issues - although the more the better if u want to battle thargoids et al.
Elite was developed alongside Oculus development kits for VR and the game's enjoyment is enhanced radically - how radical is ofc subjective :D

As for the game itself - its a bit like - in 1984 things were basic - gamer requirements were also basic.
After playing the Beta (i was a beta backer) ED was definitely an exciting re-vision ...but after a while it seemed a little ""thin"" ... combat was good but mining etc was ...well ..basic. Perhaps too basic for the modern pace of game expectations. There have been various developments - i'm not a ""powerplay"" fan and didn't like its implementation but...
BUT...
As far as space sim goes its absolutely STUNNING - Hubble accurate systems and astral bodies to suit NASA enthusiasts. Trading is hugely updated and still the challenge that it was in Elite. I could go on but: The other elements of the game - well, some are great, some not so great + still need improvement imo.
While game continues to evolve though, the ""Great"" bits are WELL worth the money (especially now.)  - Mouse n keyboard is OK if u have good muscle memory but i'd perhaps seriously rec a HOTAS for this one in VR ;) ... you will find many ED VR players have invested in their HOTAs just to play this. (It's THAT Good! ) I made the choice to buy VR after umming n arring for ages. Apart from  an ever continuing hope that a great star wars VR might materialise, it was Elite Dangerous (+ a flight sim or 2) that became the main driver for my decision to go ahead.

If you like games with a massive community and VR, this is for you.
If you dont want to wait for Star Citicen any longer und VR, this is for you.
If you like role-playing and VR, this is for you.

Pro's:
- Superb visual quality with an unbeliveable amount of detail
- absolute freedom
- microtransactions do not affect players abilities. they are just (nice) cosmetics.
- plenty of and highly customizeable ships to choose from (if you can afford them^^)
- 400 billion star systems to explore, the galaxy is build up as accurate as humans know so far
- many player driven clans with their own goals and policy
- 2 multiplayer (open, private) and 1 single-player (solo) options to play. and you can switch between them any time.
- and much more, its just awesome.

Con's:
- very steep learning curve, you will just be thrown in cold, deadly space. don't skip the training missions! watch the provided training videos and so on. Or learn it the hard way :)
- long distances to travel, where nothing happens. but hey, thats, how space is!
- many idiots in open game PVP, who like to kill you for the lolz. It IS avoidable in ""open"", but  often frustrating. join ""mobius"" private group for multiplayer PVE.
- every player - and i mean: every - is still waiting for atmospheric landing. you CAN land on planets without atmosphere allready though.
- missions from the mission board are often repititive.
- trading is persistent, but missions are'nt.

neutral:
- you MUST set your own goals or be bored to death
- HOTAS strongly recommended

final words:
as a kid, watching Star Wars, Star Trek or Captain Future, did'nt you dream of flying in your own spaceship through the galaxy? Visit the stars, the orion nebular or the massive black hole Sagittarius A in the center of our milky way? Or seeking and hunting down pirate scum (or be one)?

2022-05-28 12:47:31.361833,lexrax,Elite Dangerous .. VR at its best :),"I have been playing this since mid 2014. I was playing on a 3 Monitor setup until late July 2017 when Oculous had a sale and decided to buy it from Amazon. I brought ELITE DANGEROUS from the Frontier Store (Sorry Oculous). When you buy it (ED) from Oculous/Steam you will have to make a Frontier account. You will get 1 Steam key for Elite Dangerous with Horizons or without. You will also get a Oculous Store key for your chosen Elite Dangerous Edition. This can be found in the 3rd party keys section on your Frontier account on their website. Just go into the Oculous Home application and click on the cog on the right hand top of the window, before the minimise icon. You navigate to the REDEEM CODE and input the Oculous code you got from the 3rd party keys section on the frontier site and Elite Dangerous is added to your games list. 

Their is a STEEP learning curve with Elite Dangerous. So I would suggest you go to Youtube and watch some videos or hop on to Twitch and the Elite Dangerous streamers list. Anything with "" [SOV] "" or "" Sovereignty "" in the title will answer any questions you have. They will give you HONEST answers and help you with advice in Elite Dangerous.

 You start out in a side winder with 100 credits. FIRST THING YOU DO, BUY a FUEL SCOOP, Or when you run out of fuel you will explode and go back to the Start !!  You then start to do missions from the missions console in the space station to earn credits to buy bigger ships. You can EXPLORE, MINE, TRADE, BOUNTY HUNT or do Normal space missions to earn in game credits. Their are 400 Billion stars to explore, or become a Trader (Space Trucker). You can mine to collect minerals, etc, that you can sell to a station for ingame credits. 

I have over 2000+ Hours ingame and 40+ in VR that has added to the Immense depth that this game shows you. CMDR Lexax , signing off. Cya in the Black  Commanders ;)","Sep 6, 2017 at 9:15 PM",5, 12,

Third set up voice attack with an optional HCS voice pack.  With this done you can enjoy the VR mode completly (without groping for the keyboard)!

WOW TERRIBLE controls if you want to use the touch good luck it needs a major rework. You will spend every 30 sec taking off the VR (game has become unresponsive or flipping upside down about every 4 times which will require a restart). This is UNPLAYABLE in VR with touch!
1. Touch controls need a rework 
2. you will spend most of the time trying to figure out what button does what with no help at all.
3. the tutorials  and not made to work with touch controls. The instructions are not clear and you will have to REMOVE THE VR AGAIN to figure out what control does what..
4. Instead of touch implamentation it seems the company did a quick remap to the touch controllers and put no effort into testing them. Play 5 min with the touch and you will see.
5. Expect game to crash ever 3-4 times you take off the VR or you will need to force quit it because the view is upside down.
7. Galaxy map if you move back (zoom out) you also move the cursor down in the left pane (the one you can change with bumpers) but pressing the opposite way does nothing. So if you pass up the search box (1st item) then there is no way to go back up all the while moving around the map getting disoriented.
8. The ship (touch controls) feels like I am trying to control a wale swimming through the desert.
9. Galaxy map exit button does not work you have to press y on controller. Also does not work when I press it with the mouse after taking off the VR headset AGAIN.....
10. I guess I will never leave the home system. After taking off the HMD AGAIN to search for a system now the blue selection higlight is gone and I can't select anything. RESTARTING GAME AGAIN......","Sep 28, 2017 at 7:23 PM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 12:47:40.813899,xenophil,"Truly terrific, but not easy to learn","First off - I have been a fan of the original Elite when it came out in 1984 and was overjoyed when I heard about the Kickstarter campgain for a current-technology relaunch.


What Frontier came out with has the same immersive, open play atmosphere as always - there is no set goal, no defined storyline you HAVE to follow, you do whatever you please and let the world evolve around you.

The flying experience in a number of different ""realistic"" ships, or the driving around on planets with your surface vehicle is a simply terrific experience.

However, the realism has a downside. If you want to really master flying like Han Solo (yes, you totally can!) you must be able to control a number of functions - a lot more than your normal game pad has buttons for.

I compromise by using the gamepad and keyboard controls that I can find blindly, even though that does break the immersion a bit. Touch control is yet too unprecise/too slow to be used in the heat of battle!

As a piece of advice to those who found the game impossible to play - by all means, please learn the basic controls in desktop mode (In the Oculus App, right-click and select ""Play in desktop mode""). Only when you feel you are familiar with the functions, and have a button definition that works for you, switch to using the Oculus. It may be a longer process and require some effort before you get the full reward, but believe me it is totally worth it.","Aug 6, 2017 at 3:49 AM",5, 15,

Playing it without VR would be a joke now. This is hands down the most awesome experience I've had so far with VR!

To address some comments: It is a PC game so of course keyboard is supported; as is the pack-in xbox one controller; as is the oculus touch controller. I prefer the keyboard but to each his own.

You have to register because this is an ONLINE game. If your view is not properly centered/positioned, open up the oculus menu (oculus button on the remote) and select 'recenter view'. Almost every game I play in VR requires me to do this here and there.

As for the advanced combat training mission; skip it. Once you get the basics, go into the game. Unless you plan on being an expert dogfighter on day one (you won't), play the game and come back to the tutorials and videos later.

And lastly, BUY FROM STEAM. Then you can log into your game account and get the access codes for the oculus store. Make sure you put them all in to get the expansions (if you purchased the pack).

A friend of mine recommended I give it a try.  Glad that he did.  In VR this game is really fun to play.  It looks amazing Kind of daunting at first with all the controls you need to remember.  I tried using the touch controllers but it did not really feel that great and could not really do all that I needed with them.  I went and bought me a Thrustmaster T. Flight hotas 4 for the PS4 that can also be used on PC.  What a huge difference that stick has made.  The game runs great (Geforce 1070 card) I was able to map just about all my keys to the Hotas 4. It looks and feels really good in VR.   If you are using your flight stick you can still map keys to your touch controllers and there are no issues using them with the flight stick.

Last but not least in reference to a previous poster. If you are in game and the VR is off use your right touch controller's home button.  It exits to the home screen go to reset view on the right side, then after reset it puts you back in the game with everything set correctly.  Quick fix.

2022-05-28 12:48:03.082490,CaballoLeche,Don't buy through Oculus,"Besides O.R.'s no return policy the game can be acquired for much, much cheaper through steam or a gamekey site and the code redeemed within the account for oculus.

Don't be surprised by the key validation loop bug in the launcher... Even the devs don't bother to tell you that you have to verify the website account before you can validate the launcher key. If you get stuck in a validation loop then go to the frontier site and log in/activate first. Don't complain because you don't know how to use google.

All that aside this game is exactly what I've been waiting for in VR; ""replayability"". If you want to feel like you ARE a space cadet, you NEED to get this game.

I have been a huge fan of simulators of every flavor for years, and that was my intent when I bought the Rift... To be immersed in simulation. With a full HOTAS rig, rudder pedals, and voice attack software. This game goes FAR beyond any other space combat sim. Star Trek Bridge Crew has NOTHING on the complexity and immersion this game offers.

Now if Frontier would just fix the galaxy map controls for VR they would have one of the only games worth $60 on the oculus store... *HINT HINT, NUDGE NUDGE.*","Jul 4, 2017 at 11:28 PM",5, 12,

You will get reacquainted with old music you loved, and if you're smart, you'll find new music that fits the game well (Youtube for the band Elder, album Legend. Thank me later) You'll start researching stars, figuring out which ones you can scoop fuel from (Types KGB FOAM, fyi) Buy yourself a HOTAS. You can find cheap ones on ebay. The game plays great with a xbox pad, but you'll be lacking a few buttons. Not a problem in 2D as you can have a keyboard handy. VR..... not so much. Snag a cheap x52 and prepare to venture into the stars. Nothing comes close to giving you the feeling of owning your own star ship quite like this game. Just remember to pace yourself. The game is constantly evolving, and you can definitely over-do the game. My advice is to not grind, but to have fun. There's plenty to do to have fun, but setting specific goals for yourself that stray from the goal of fun will set you down the grind path, too much of which can burn you out on a beautiful game.

NOTE: To points other reviewers have made: You can recenter the view if it's off through the home menu, or by hitting F12. Yes there's a season pass you'll have to buy to land on planets. It's an expansion. There's no monthly fee for the game, they sell expansions and cosmetic items. It's really not bad. And to the guy complaining that it's not a sim because there's no inertia, hit Z to turn off flight assist. This takes your ship out of the normal mode which corrects for zero G mechanics and makes it like you're in an atmosphere. FA off lets you pull crazy moves but takes a lot of practice.

2022-05-28 12:48:22.204521,PhoenixSpyder,Top of line Space simulator,"After getting my Rift & touch and trying tonnes of VR titles...and loving all of them, I find ED is as good as it gets for VR immersion. It's built from the ground up to support VR and it really shines. Most people who play consistantly, are into this kind of simulation...those who say they get bored are usually only wanting to blow up things or not wanting to spend the time to learn how to actually play it. It has an incredibly steep learning curve...but think about it...NASA astronauts spend months if not years training to go into space...to learn what to do in all situations. ED is based on real science and real simulations...so to really learn how to do things in ED, it will take much more time than your average game, don't expect to learn everything over night. If you are into Simulation games...GET IT!!! If not, look elsewhere. There are easier games out there but nothing with the immersion level this brings.

You definitely have to get a Thrustmaster HOTAS X flight stick (minimum) to really play this game. It is the cheapest one available and is very well built for the price (+/-$70).

Also, I highly recommend getting Voice Attack & A.S.T.R.A Voicepack for use with ED. This gives you the ability to speak to the game to do things that are hard to do with limited buttons on your flight stick. A.S.T.R.A is an in game AI that is an add on and it doesn't disappoint. It will speak back at you as it responds to your commands...commands that are streamlined to work for you to free you up to keep doing other things in the game. Your voice becomes an extention of the flight stick. Plus you can also enable interactive mode that allows you to ask questions and have conversations during long space flights. 

If you don't get bored by tedious things you should have lots of fun. ED is as close as it presently gets to actually going into space and travelling the galaxy...trust me...it's very real...so real, you might forget it's only a simuation.","Apr 11, 2017 at 7:55 AM",5, 14,

I've been playing it for over 2 years on both a flat screen and VR and I'm the kind of person who enjoys it either way because I'm a huge fan of space and this game is a 1:1 scale of the Milky Way with everything we know about it included in the game. But once you are actually sitting in the pilot seat, it changes everything.

You're not looking at it from a 3rd party perspective. You are actually the pilot and you need to learn all about what the dashboards around you are all about. You can stand up and walk around your cockpit, though the early ships are a bit of a tight squeeze.

You can travel at your leisure to over 400 billion star systems, some of which have still yet to be discovered & if you find them, you can have your name permanently attached to them. If you get tired of flying around, you can land on a planet and travel around in your SRV and collect some resources you'll need for future upgrades.

If you prefer to fight, then you can upgrade to a battle ship and fight until your hearts content. You even get paid for doing it for missions as well as any bounties they have.

You do what you want, how and when you want, however:

It's a grind to gain achievements and the learning curve in every aspect of this simulator can be overwhelming. You must also have a lot of time to play it or at least understand that it is something that never ends and will likely take months to years to reach top levels.

This is the best VR experience right now and the absolute best experience ever for space enthusiasts. I want more people to enjoy this experience, but I can't recommend it because so many people won't get past the learning curve in the first few hours of play time.","Jul 3, 2017 at 2:33 PM",5, 11,

I even bought a HOTAS flight stick for this. And the feeling of sitting in a space ship, cruising between galaxies, is fantastic and real. The first 1- 2 hours might drive you mad. Landing on a space station is a pain in the ***. But then you master this, then the next thing, and soon you fly with elegance.

And then? You can trade, bounty hunt, mine asteroids, even be a tourist ship. And then there´s the neverending hunt for improvements on your ship.

Besides that - not much. The universe feels real, but also very empty. No settled planets, just some trade stations on barren rocks. 

I think I will return from time to time to Elite, but only to relax, cruise a bit between the stars and get that great feeling of sitting in your ship. But investing too much time - I think not.

Very realistic, very irritating when you only have 14 buttons, toggles or joysticks. Eventually you end up having to press a button, hold a toggle and click your joystick for something minor like raising or lowering landing gear because you just don't have buttons left to map things to. After all the switching back and forth to configure buttons while spinning in a training dogfight, and reading all the names on planets and orbitals as you spin around looking for your target destination in the cargo delivery training mission...very dizzy, kinda sick stomach and one hell of a headache.

It was between this and Eve, but due to reviews and the sheer amount of things to do, I went with Elite. I am sure I will be getting Eve eventually, but after spending over 1200 in the last month... I'm sure the faince wants me to cool down a little bit. She has a point... I've only played about 20 out of the 35 I have. 


Anyways, Elite seems to be a great game! As everyone has said, there is a pretty steep learning curve. After you start to master all of that and get the HOTAS set up the way you want, the game gets much better. I finished all of the training numerous times and now finally started the main game. Again, like everyone has said, its hard to figure out what to do first. I watched a few videos on getting started and that hopefully has helped figure out what to do and hopefully the game starts to make more sense as I go. 

All in all, the immersion is great, graphics (although a tad dated) are great, setting up HOTAS sucked but once done feels great. Figuring out what to do at the starting.... not so great but I'm early in so I know this game will get to a 5 star rating for me in time.","Apr 4, 2017 at 5:29 AM",4, 7,

I spent hundreds to get the Rift at laucnh mostly to support this game changer technology, expecting the early game to be mew, which is the case, sadly.

I used to play Elite when it launched and not much in the last year even if it was looking gorgeous on my 4K setup.

2 months ago I decided to try Elite as my Rift was sitting there unused for months and WOW that was the best decision I've made.

Elite goes from a flat 2D screen to ACTUALLY FLYING A SHIP. It is so amazing I still stop myself and just like to look around in amazement at my cockpit or just looking at the scenery around me. Nothing can explain it until you try it, trust me.

Like I said I am used to 4K resolution which is truly amazing by itself and even if my biggest gripe against the Rift rely in it's low resolution, the sense of scale and immersion totally outweights the cons.

I love it soo much, I purchase a HOTAS, the X52 Pro, which whas used by FD in their cockpit. That was the best decision ever.

I am not playing a space sim, now I am flying a ship.

If you like space sim, and want to feel how it is to be in a game instead of looking at a game, go on you will never regret it.

2022-05-28 12:48:38.066223,PacMan247366,Be realistic. This is not Gunjack.,"I've been playing this game since Alpha and Beta with the DK2.  It has gone through a lot of improvements.  Let me start with this.  Anyone who calls this a ported game just simply doesn't know what they are talking about.  This game was built 100% for PC and ported out from there, not into PC.  Second, this game was really designed with the rift in mind from the ground up.  It is gorgeous.  It is time consuming.  It can get tedious at times, but it is what you make of it.  It is ultimate sandbox.  If you are looking for a pure shooter with little input from your mind, go with gunjack.  Folks who give this game 1 or 2 stars and complain about porting and no joystick simply were not ready for a game of this caliber.  If you want to make the most of this game you need a HOTAS setup.  Pair this with an X55 and take the time to REALLY customize it and you will be simply blown away.  Xbox joystick ?  Are you kidding me ?  What kind of immersion are you looking for with an Xbox controller ? I can't immagine limiting the intended experience to that extent with this game.  Forget about KB, get rid of the xbox controller.  Get real.  This is simply the best space flight sim / dog fighting / economy based game on RIFT, period !  Be ready to invest some time, this is serious business.  Elite Dangerous is NOT gunjack.","Jan 16, 2017 at 12:01 AM",5, 12,

My experience was close to as poor as it gets: Once you buy it, you still cannot play it. You'll need to go through an extensive amount of unnecessary signup steps, which simply didn't work for me. I see others commenting the same. I got a hold of support to solve the issue (which first caused additional issues). There's no excuse that users should have to spend so much time. When I finally got in, controls simply didn't work. Turns out gamepad isn't enabled by default, so you're left with using the keyboard while still wearing the headset.
Once you're inside the game, the controls are confusing and the tutorial is nothing to impress. I still have issues with making controls work every time I launch it.
BUT.. On the positive side: It looks great!

You may ask, why the 4 starts then?  Well, I am rating this for VR.  As such there are some issues that can make it aggrevating at first.  When you are going through the initial setup process, realize that the login button is just not going to work until you exit out and come back in, no matter how many codes they send to your email.  Also realize that there will be much back and forth between VR and your desktop at first as the in-game tutorials are not sufficient to learn the large amount of things you will need to know.  Some of the tutorials are YouTube videos while other things you will just have to Google to figure out.

Other VR issues:
 - The loading screen is 2D and at the bottom of your vision.  You will want to look down to see it but it will just move further down on you.
 - When you start the game, it will open a window.  That window will open another window.  You must click on that second window before any of your controls will work correctly.
 - Some of the setup takes place on the left side of your vision in the HUD.  This can be tough when you need to use your HUD and a keyboard, especially if you didn't realize that you need to click in that second window.
 - The videos open up YouTube on your desktop.
 - The controls for your left hand control the right hand of your avatar.
 - The controls can do different things depending on where you are looking.  This can be very confusing when still learning all the controls.

- Deleting game from oculus App library works in terms of it says it is uninstalled successfully. Upon launching new game however in regular screen mode, Oculus App keeps starting the game VR mode (although it was deleted, WTF????)
- Clean installs DO NOT solve the issue. Deleted and reinstalled it 3x with the Launcher, DID NOT WORK!!
- GeForce experience does not recognize ED anymore for regular use after you installed the VR version, meaning, you cannot use GeForce experience App to hard-select the regular screen mode over the VR mode!

If you are interested in gameplay etc I encourage you to look up reviews of the game itself. But, for my part I have really enjoyed it. Think of it as a future simulation of some kind where mankind has moved into and living in space.

Elite has some of the best VR for a complete game available for the Rift. The difference of playing it in the Rift is almost not comparable to outside the Rift. The visuals are clear, the feeling of immersivness is great, and the control the HMD give you in the game is really cool.

2022-05-28 12:49:06.890109,00prometheus,An immense experience!,"This game lets you truly experience the immensity of space! As a first-person cockpit experience it is quite mild on the nausea, apart from when driving fast on planets in your rover. The game is unforgiving in its challenge. There is no story, no checkpoints, nothing to guide you on your way. Instead it places you smack-bang in the persona of a dirt-poor 'Harmless' rookie in a tiny ship and a fantastically detailed space simulation. Everything from a live galactic economy in human-inhabited space, haunting hints of aliens on distant stars, pirates, evil players (if you play in ""Open""), mining the rings of gas giants for rare metals, ferreting out profitable trade routes or mercenary work for superpower fleets, join a guild to actually influence the galactic politics, or spend real-time months exploring out far past the galactic core, where the contrast to the bustle of the human ""bubble"" creates a powerful feeling of the explorer's solitude. All in a painstakingly correct physical replica of the whole 400 billion star galaxy (the constellations are correct when at Sol, because all the stars really are in their positions), planetary orbits are realistic, gravity, planetary surfaces, and all the stellar star types from O-types to black holes (including gravitational lensing!) are represented faithfully. Above all it is a wondrously beautiful experience in the Rift. The feeling of a space station's size is exhilarating in the Rift, the sharp contrasts of deep space pops out magnificently, the planets and stars are beautiful (and realistically rendered). For an extra colourful experience, try flying out to the Horsehead nebula to examine it close up!

By hook or crook, gain the money to kit a killer bounty hunting ship, super-size space trader or fully outfitted deep-in-the-void exploration ship. Claw your way to ""Elite"" status in combat, trading and exploration. Or enter ""Close Quarters Combat"" mode for immediate fast paced PvP action in a battle arena.","Jan 29, 2017 at 11:23 AM",5, 8,

The VR experience is second to none, the sale is amazing.  Driving your SRV up to a base or huge ship, like the Anaconda or Corvette, it's amazing.  Seemlessly going from driving to flight is incredible.","Nov 22, 2016 at 7:48 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 12:49:10.037813,Elpoc,Still a fundamentally flawed game,"Whilst Frontier has crafted an undoubtedly stunning VR experience, with satisfying mechanics for flight, combat and (mostly) travel, they still have two major problems. The first is their highly deficient attitude to multiplayer. Terrible P2P match-making tech makes any multiplayer play unreliable at best, and impossible at worst, as it's a complete lottery whether or not you'll end up in the same instance as your friends, even when grouped up. Not only that, but Frontier refuses to implement a proper in-game player groups system, meaning organising any coordinated play from within the game has to be done via a 'friends list' and the tiny 4-man 'wings' mechanic. To top it all off, there is no player-to-player trading mechanic or money transfer system, and the in-game markets only allow trade of mostly useless 'commodities', not the actual ships, modules, ammunition and so on which are actually useable by the players. These last two decisions are utterly bizarre in the context of what is supposed to be a 'sandbox' game with trading as a major feature.
Missions are the second major problem; although they have been improved since the release of the game, they still feel barebones. The missions system is important because it's deeply embedded in the 'background sim' factions mechanic, which is the only meaningful way in which players can affect the galaxy they play in. But there are two serious issues. The first is that mission lists in stations still often come up with sparse pickings. There's no reason for this; just set a bottom limit which means there will always be something to do when a player logs in. The second is a complete lack of inventiveness. Missions could be a showcase for the amazing core gameplay, from stealth & landing/scooping mechanics (sneak up to enemy base and steal some data/cargo) to combat strategy (introduce some cool settings e.g. ship graveyards/abandoned stations/shipyards/asteroid bases, and vary the objectives a little). Maybe someday...","Nov 15, 2016 at 9:37 PM",2, 10,

Add the VR component, and you have my personal favorite experience in VR.  You are IN the world.  You will lose all sense of time while exploring the galaxy.

I had the most fun in the free game mode for this they offered called Elite dangerous arena (CQC). It was a multiplayer close quarter combat mode. Sort of like Eve Valkyrie but way more fun and much deeper gameplay mechanics. The issue with that was the horrible matchmaking system that broke that game mode though . Games would not start without a certain number of players, and now CQC is completely dead because they just never fixed it.

Anyways, that was kind of a side mode for this game but just wish they would focus on fixing that. Overall this game is good.","Nov 14, 2016 at 6:12 AM",4, 4,
