2022-05-28 19:41:24.416809,Spalman_yt,Fine,"It's exactly like in the pictures, the description made no false promises or raised hopes. It's really just setting dominos and letting them fall. It would be nice if there would be more variety, but the game description is accurate, so I didn't expect much. Would recommend if you wanna kill some minutes.","Nov 28, 2019 at 5:27 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:41:24.430772,neuro27,Mildly Amusing,This was genuinely mildly amusing! Two stars. Would need some pre-loaded tracks and 3D elements to improve.,"Nov 16, 2019 at 9:58 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 19:41:24.445731,Rift8299292,Really good,"Didn't expect this to be anything better than ok but tried it since it was free. The game is actually really fun, with great sound effects..
The world is poorly made but an unrealistic super flat world with the realsim of VR is an intresting experience","Mar 22, 2019 at 1:29 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:41:24.461689,thornae,Fun distraction,"Sure, it's not as pretty as some apps, and it's fairly sparse as far as features go, but for a free app, it's well worth a shot. As simple as it is, there's something immensely satisfying about creating an intricate track and then just watching it all click over.","Sep 3, 2018 at 5:17 AM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 19:41:27.571492,Remmer_G,Relaxing Fun,"This is just a relaxing way to have some fun. Does what it says. Simple enough interface, easy to add lots of dominos and knock them down, and easy to edit your layout. If there is going to be further development, I would suggest ramps or other structures to add height to our creations, and a way to save and recall multiple layouts. Either way, thanks!","Mar 24, 2018 at 7:48 AM",5, 3,
