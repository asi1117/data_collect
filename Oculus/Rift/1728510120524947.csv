2022-05-28 15:15:21.097545,TsaberX,This is still worth picking up,"This is part two of the series.  The puzzles get a little more this time around involved but I ended up spending hours just using my gauntlets.  I would suggest buying the first part just so you get the context of where the game is going.  

Visuals 4 - for the time it release I though it was pretty good
Sound 4 - the ambient sound quality is pretty good
voice acting 5 - you get this from cassette tapes and flashbacks
Replay ability 4 - I enjoyed just playing with my powers
controller 4 - there is a light learning curve with the left and right brain thing but nothing to difficult
Over all emersion 5 - yeah I was in this world",Jan 25 at 8:18 AM,4, 0,

2022-05-28 15:15:21.156387,GreenSquid772,,"Great adventure/puzzle experience. The graphics, voice acting, and story are all really well done - this is one of the most immersive and polished indie VR games.

The story ends on a satisfying note, but I hope we get the planned third chapter. I enjoy arcadey VR games like Pistol Whip (latest project from the devs). However, my personal hope for VR is to see more experiences like this that focus on story, atmosphere, exploration and wonder. Give me that real holodeck experience that transports me to another world!","Apr 5, 2020 at 1:15 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:15:24.279035,FreeBowJobs,A little buggy but worth it,"They did a good job pulling you into the story of an alien world. Good visuals and neat puzzles, and about 3 hours of gameplay so a decent value for the money. It would have gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for a weird loss of hand tracking bug that kept happening when reading the holoscripts, the settings menu was frustrating to navigate and it could have been a little better optimized but it's still definitely worth a playthrough.","Aug 26, 2019 at 5:39 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 15:15:24.294992,ErrolMc,,Easily one of the best VR experiences available.  Navigation controls are frustrating but still highly recommended.,"Jun 29, 2019 at 5:24 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 15:15:24.309953,Anomalous2141,Episodes One and Two,"(I will be using the same review for both games for two reasons: I suspect most people will want to play both, and I simply don't recommend playing one without the other.)  Simply put, this is a fantastic game.  I really hope there's a third episode in the works to conclude the story about the sister, but what's here is quite compelling, and there's quite a bit of resolution at the end of the second episode to allow me to call this a fine work in and of itself.  Is it perfect?  Sadly no.  The first episode is frustratingly short, and the second is overly dependent on a minigame to advance the plot wherein you have to guide a stone-like object through a virtual tunnel dodging obstacles along the way: it's clever at first, but becomes repetitive, and then maddeningly difficult by the end (the last one is particularly bad).  But apart from that, there really isn't much to hate about these games.  The world building is impressive and the puzzles are challenging but not without thought.  Particularly in the second episode, I got a real Myst-like feeling, but unlike Myst these puzzles made sense.  Good job!  Looking forward to the next (last?) one!","Mar 8, 2019 at 3:29 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 15:15:24.325910,PseudoSoul,I Truly Left This Reality,"Longer than episode 1, smooth locomotion added, and I need more of this. Where is episode 3?","Feb 18, 2019 at 4:28 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:15:24.340869,XtremeHardcoreGamer,Performance issues,"Despite graphical jitters- I went ahead and completed the game. It is a great games. Good story, great graphics, great voice acting, high production value, good music. Just as good as the first game. Although a little shorter. It is also buggy at times. Updating my score so hopefully more people play it and there perhaps could be a third episode sometime in the future.

Old review: 8700k, Gtx 1080, 16GB DDR4----- Game has graphical jitters that is not easy to ignore. Other games run fine on my machine. This exhibits a jitter/flickering behavior. Even in the low preset. The great episode 1 didn't have this issue. Disappointing. I held on to the game instead of refunding in hopes that either I could find a workaround solution or the game was patched. Neither happened. So I am stuck with a game that imo is broken as far as I am concerned. I'll update my review if anything improves.","Dec 17, 2018 at 10:37 AM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 15:15:27.477480,Siccors,One of the top VR games,"Sure I ran into a few bugs, and I am sure someone wants different locomotion style. But it is a puzzle/adventure game, locomotion is not the most important. Overall it is challenging (few times I did resort to Google), it is polished, great looking and nice story behind it. My guestimate is that I spend around 5-6 hours on it. Longer would be nice, but overall for me this is a game with similar quality as Lone Echo, and a must have for VR.","Nov 4, 2018 at 11:29 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:15:27.492440,MillenniumGhost,Most Impressive VR Game Ever Made,"I'm not exaggerating.  This is my favorite VR game for multiple reasons... 

1. Excellent storytelling.  Raises the bar for VR and the way we tell stories in general.
2. Beautiful design.  Though the game world itself is not technically epic, the amount of detail put into small spaces and back story (which can be uncovered throughout at random) makes the Gallery worlds feel...well..epic.  
3. Smooth and intuitive controls.  Unlike some other games with ambitious scope, Emberstone balances everything just right so the immersion is never off-kilter.
4. Episodic.  The first Gallery Episode (Call of the Starseed) was equally impressive (and recommended first for full story immersion) but not nearly as ambitious as this.  And with the amount of passion Cloudhead Games clearly has for their craft, Episode 3 and beyond can be expected to raise the bar for VR storytelling into the foreseeable future.","Oct 12, 2018 at 5:50 AM",5, 6,

GREAT story with GREAT voice acting. Loved the puzzles and will def. buy episoid 3 the day it comes out!","Sep 12, 2018 at 3:56 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:15:30.614091,Tarbal,Another good installment...,"of this series. I felt it was better than the first. With more skill based puzzles than just working stuff out, they have made some good choices in the differences between this and the first part. 3 hours of game play from start to finsh but every bit of it enjoyable and a good vr experience.","Aug 23, 2018 at 6:28 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:15:30.630048,Shadowdawnz,Brilliant!,"Absolutely brilliant.

2022-05-28 15:15:30.645009,catalysteh,"Very good, but could use more polish","This is a pretty darn good adventure game. The environments are well crafted, has a solid and interesting narrative, and it's reasonably long (for a VR title).

I'd give this 5 stars if the game didn't bug out with certain puzzles and require a restart. 

Overall, a strong experience — worth your time and money, but not heavily polished.","May 18, 2018 at 5:51 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 15:15:33.723774,MrDanielVR,,"Fun little experience by a devoted and talented team. Some aspects of it are done to perfection and others like some design choices which I assume came out of budget consideration like the never ending text and audio tapes and the repeditivness of the rooms hurt it. I enjoyed it though puzzle wise it wasn't very challenging. There were no ahh-ha moments of sulving or understanding how to make something work.
I really hope that the team will get a big fat investor which will allow them to build in a bigger scale because their essence is to make quality content and to push VR forward. Good luck to you guys.","May 6, 2018 at 10:47 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 15:15:33.753694,plogarn,Loved it!,"This kind of experience was exactly what I imagined when I first preordered my Rift. 

To sum it up:

- Good story
- Great visuals and atmospheric environments
- Love the music
- Challenging pussels but not too difficult (good level)
- Decent game play mechanics

Needless to say, it adds a lot to the immersion to have a big playspace.

I really really liked it. Episode 2 is better, sure - its longer, deeper, new. But if you decide to play it, start with Episode 1 - its a mindbreaker - both games! WOW!

2022-05-28 15:15:36.882326,deckLE,Awesome Games,"We are not huge gamers and really prefer this type of game. The story line is great, the puzzles are challenging but doable, and the VR experience is out of this world. You won't shoot anything (but can move dead skeletons around).

2022-05-28 15:15:36.911248,RemMIDI,Well done.  Bravo!,"I never write reviews on anything but I really enjoyed this game.  The whole VR experience is here, without just shooting and stressing.  You have to think.  Figure things out.  A nice new idea for keys and locks.  Going through it again for more detailed story.  Played 1 and 2 in order after trying out the free demo.  Thank you.","Jan 22, 2018 at 7:47 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:15:36.926208,goreroad,The first episode was way better...,"I loved the first ep. It still is in my top five VR games I have played. The second chapter was not nearly as fun for me. What made the first ep so great was the immersion, the way you are led by a trail of breadcrumbs on what felt like a true adventure. Finding the tapes, the flashlight, making your way through varied areas all on this quest to find your sister. The level design was fantastic, the pacing etc.

Episode two just did not make me feel like I was on an adventure. The magic was not there. I think the focus on puzzles gimped the exploration, adventure feel of the first one. Going to a new world should be magical, but the world consists of a few locations that you just shuttle back and forth from. There was nothing as cool as the beach, wandering into the sewers and so forth. I felt like I was in a puzzle game, not like I was on some epic quest. I just wanted to explore this new world, not load back and forth between a few small locations and do puzzles nonstop.

Even finding the tapes lost most of the magic. I found them all in my first half hour of play. I really preferred finding them progressively throughout the entire playthrough. Also I really didn't care that much about the people of the new world, and I think that was partially because I wasn't that into the hologram method of story telling.

Still, the puzzles are really well done, the graphics are great, and the music is still incredible. The ending was great as well, unfortunately it sometimes felt like work to get there. If you are more into puzzle solving, then you will really enjoy it more than I did. I hope the next episode is more adventure, exploration based.","Dec 8, 2017 at 1:47 AM",3, 8,
2022-05-28 15:15:36.941168,Siegfriedshead,"Wow, just wow.","I've been a fan of these kinds of adventure games for a long time and this is tied with Obdcution as the best ones in VR. This is the puzzle adventure game for the average user and Obduction is the one for the veterans, but this is such a good game that everyone needs to play it regardless of genre preferences.
Everything from the story, the environment, the engimgatic feel everything has, to the characters make your hairs stand on end. this is a masterpiece.
I can't wait until the next episode.","Jan 12, 2018 at 6:58 AM",5, 3,

I will give you 5 stars if you translate your games to some more languages. At least in my country (Spain) there's almost a boycott against VR devs that do not translate their games.","Dec 20, 2017 at 8:15 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 15:15:40.053843,Plurr,,"I tried it out for perhaps less than half an hour, and now I'll request a refund. I didn't enjoy it... The puzzles were super-easy and you encounter them all the time, to open doors, to use elevators, or anything. It's seems to be essentially a puzzle game, but I didn't find the puzzles enjoyable. There didn't seem to be all that much of a narrative. Environments didn't resonate with me either. Both as a puzzle game, or adventure experience, it seemed lacking. I gave it three stars only because I assume other people enjoy it more. Otherwise, I'd have given it two.","Dec 21, 2017 at 3:56 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 15:15:40.075784,Mancomb_Seepgood,Very Good game with some short comings.,"Overall, this series of games is well worth the purchase. This episode is not different, I had a great time playing through the story/puzzels. The loading times between zones is way too long and you have to go back and forth quite a bit. Some of how the story unfolds with these holograms doesnt even make sense to me. All in all I enjoyed this little adventure. I high recommend you play Episode 1 before this.","Nov 29, 2017 at 1:29 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:15:40.091742,TheMackMetroid,Sweet but as short as the first,First off the graphics are great and gameplay holds up for the most part (though there were a couple of occasions in which it stuttered). The voice acting is decent also. However there is only a small limited evironment (3 areas) in which you will need to backtrack to and from a lot (without given much away there is also an annoyingly repetitive underground catacomb maze which proves to be a bit of a chore). Personally prefered the more linear approach of the first chapter. I got this believing it was going to be longer then the first but is actually roughly the same in length - it took me about 4 hours to complete (though it depends I guess on how quickly you can solve the puzzles). To sum up a solid but a little underwealming 2nd chapter - would reommend it for a lower price then the £20+ it curently is (I personally would value it at no more then £10).,"Oct 19, 2017 at 11:54 PM",3, 15,
2022-05-28 15:15:43.209403,RScullion,Bit boring really,"Loved the first episode and couldn't wait to play this. However, I was bored. The gameplay is very linear (much like the first) but there are only a small number of locations (6?) that you shuttle backwards and forwards between. To make it worse the loading time between areas is very long. The story is also pretty dull. If I hadn't paid so much for it I probably wouldn't have finished it and it's not that long. There are other games out there that are far better now (e.g. Obduction, Lone Echo). This is very expensive for what it is.","Nov 8, 2017 at 7:20 AM",3, 6,

I cannot speak for length yet, but I have not been WOW'd like this since Lone Echo. Some truly great VR here. A 30 hour adventure game in the vein of this would be heaven.
