2022-05-28 15:38:26.019374,BNS.Random.Precision,Not the most optimised VR game!,"I'd love to give a glowing review of the game start to end but not possible for now. Whilst the gameplay, when it works is pretty intense, there is a problem I seem to get only when playing this game.  There is no other title in my collection with this problem (or similar) and I have many VR games across Steam, Oculus, Uplay, Epic, GOG and Origin, among others.

When the play area gets busy with AI, I lose smooth tracking action on the touch controllers. The controllers become laggy, not following their true movement and ruining any chance to defend and aim and any real progression in the game.

I find if I duck behind a barrier, where available so they're not in direct line of sight, the controller lag frees up. But who wants to play a VR FPS game holding a gun over the top of a barrier, shooting blindly in the direction of the AI? That's no fun and is a game stopper for me.

I've played with the video quality down to lowest settings and still get the controller lag.  My rig is 3 yo running with 16Gb DDR4, Ryzen 1700X on X370 motherboard, Palit GTX1070 Super Jetstream, Rift S + touch (using fresh batteries.)","Dec 10, 2020 at 2:11 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 15:38:26.033337,Slick1984,Good Game,"It's a little more than a glorified wave shooter, but what it does is nice. The surroundings are nice, even though it looks kind of generic. The gameplay is nice and smooth, but again, it's a little more than a glorified wave shooter. 

I do like the game and I was smiling the whole time, but it just isn't up to the latest in VR. I think that's why this game didn't take off, the way it should.

Is there a save in the campaign? 

There are four different units in which to choose. They are all different and the same. Their shots are different, their tethers are different, but they all shoot and have tethers. They have different life levels. Their shields are different sizes.

There is an act (story) going on in the headset, while you're playing. It reminds me of ""Defense Grid 2"", while playing the campaign, there are AI's arguing. It's really annoying. It even sounds like it's the same writer and actors voices.

I could see this game being really fun for friends. I didn't experience any motion sickness.","May 27, 2020 at 7:48 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 15:38:26.048297,EchoExclusive,Best shooting game ever,"My favourite shooting game ever. 4 different characters to choose from, all very different (shield size, shooting powers). Different locations to choose from. 2 types of games: Campaign or Survival. Many people know SuperHot and Beat Saber. Evasion should be the 3rd most popular game! Absolutely love it. Archiact always make great games!

[Update 1 year later]
Still playing it and still loving it :P The interaction between Mabel and Dyson is the best!","Apr 4, 2021 at 7:45 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:38:26.063257,user045,"Really good gameplay,  AAA environments",I've just bought and started playing this over the past few days. My initial thoughts are the gameplay is great and the environments are AAA. Really enjoying it so far. Will update my review once I gain more hours. Devs have put a lot of hard work into this which I admire.,"Nov 3, 2019 at 11:55 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:38:26.078217,CURTROCK,Wow! Finally...,"I can't believe i missed this when it came out last year...If you like the look of Halo/GOW, and the run & gun style of Quake or Doom, you are gonna LOVE this game. The guns feel weighty and satisfying. Finally, a AAA graphics style shooter, with a good campaign in VR. Don't miss this. Easy 5 stars.","Jul 8, 2019 at 12:27 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 15:38:29.193884,taquitobuddy,Decent shooter with great graphics,"Pros:
-Fantastic graphics
-Good voicework, passable story
-Solid VR implementation
-Great devs, really nice people
-Coop is where the game shines

Cons:
-Coop isn't crossplatform
-Needs more movement options (like jumping, dashing)
-Needs more abilities, like in Raw Data

Additionally, my coop partner experienced crashes and couldn't play (mine worked fine) so maybe some bugs.  Tough call on the star rating.  If you have a friend to play coop with (like 95% of VR games, no one online) then I'd recommend picking this up on sale.  Really a 3-star game, but gonna bump it up for 4 stars because the devs are really nice.","Jul 3, 2019 at 4:52 PM",4, 9,
2022-05-28 15:38:29.208844,mkiejna,Space Pirates Trainer Meets HALO,"This game requires a feature update - make sure you can't shoot through the shield and if you do, the shot will bounce back and hurt you ala Space Pirates. Otherwise, it's too easy - crouch, put up shield and shoot through the shield to enemies. Devs fix this up.","Dec 26, 2018 at 8:04 AM",4, 22,
2022-05-28 15:38:29.223804,Rifty50,I love it...but nobody is on co-op,"The levels are very hard on solo (imo, maybe I'm just trash), because of all the bullets just being hailed at you. Overall it's a 5-star game, but really needs more players.","Jan 25, 2019 at 3:53 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 15:38:29.238763,theregoes2,I love it!,"On reddit someone posted that this was a bit like Halo and then in the comments someone else said that it was basically a glorified wave shooter. I'm more on team Halo. It's Halo-like environments, with Doom-like action and a bit of shoot-em up craziness. 
To me, a wave shooter is a game where I don't move and the enemies just keep coming. This is not that. You have full movement and one of the best implementations of comfort blinders I've seen yet if you need them. Very unintrusive. But you very much enter an area and then have to kill everything before you move on. Which is actually a lot like Halo or Doom but could, I suppose, be considered wave shootery.
I haven't tried the co-op yet so I can't coment on that, but going alone is plenty of fun.","Oct 10, 2018 at 10:53 PM",5, 29,
2022-05-28 15:38:29.253723,randito3,Great Game,"If your looking for a good FPS game this definitely fits the bill.  The game mechanics are well done and the graphics are really good.  I dont get motion sickness so free motion is what I choose.  I do think that the actual movement needs to be slightly increased or give the player the option to chose fast or slow movement for the player.  
Update: Had played earlier today and the game crashed a few times.  Played the game tonight for 3 hours with no crashes.  I couple places froze for a few seconds, but it continued where it froze from.  The game is really good. Updating my review to 5 stars because in my opinion it really is that good.
Keep up the great work.","Oct 11, 2018 at 11:19 AM",5, 31,
2022-05-28 15:38:32.361411,IamRuuts,,"Loving the game, delivers on every level a game like this should...super fun...only problem I'm having is my controller wants to straife to the left without prodding more often than not...I am really wanting to keep this game, but am afraid to go past the 2 hour mark as I am tempted to return this till it gets fixed.  Want to give this 5 stars as it deserves, but as for my personal experience I cannot until this issue is fixed....Update...Started noticing a little drifting to the left in a different game, think my touch controller is going bad.  5 stars.","Oct 20, 2018 at 4:05 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 15:38:32.376371,Acnetits,Good so far,"I'm about 3 missions into the campaign, and I'm impressed so far. The gun power- ups are fun to use, and the guns feel good. It has decent graphics settings so you can make adjustments, and it looks great on ""epic"" setting.  Love being able to freely walk around too. The only suggestion I have for the devs is to add settings so you can turn off the feature that makes you move in the direction your head is turned, and a way to disable the auto-walk. Don't know if it's a bug or not, but when I move around with the left stick, sometimes I just keep walking even when not pushing forwards on the stick. Overall a great VR game though, excited to see what they add in the future.","Nov 10, 2018 at 9:38 PM",5, 8,

My Quick Thoughts:
A solid FPS arcade shooter with plenty of spit and polish. These are my favorite style of games in VR. A fast paced shooter with a campaign  progression. (See my video above for my FULL impressions)
PLEASE NOTE:  This video was recorded before the game was Officially released so I never got to try out Co-op.","Oct 10, 2018 at 3:47 AM",4, 28,
