2022-05-28 19:43:49.142402,wizardunique,Fantastic experience!,"Fantastic experience! I was able to experience Rome as it was ~2000 years ago and I absolutely enjoyed it.
+1) The narration is good and provides a lot of information. There are also interviews with experts and I liked the meta-perspective of the narration (e.g. ""we have no historical records about the interior of this chamber, that's why in our model the door is closed"" or ""we are not sure about the exact placement of this object but according to a study from 2005 it makes sense to place it here"").
+2) The 3D models look very good (shadows, reflections, textures, fire/smoke/water etc), there is for example very little repetition in the floor tiles, it feels like every tile is individual. The human avatars look photorealistic and some of the statues were truly amazing! A lot of attention to details, I like it.
+3) There is a lot to explore and one gets a very good sense about the dimensions of the Forum. Looks of the interior are provided whenever there is enough historical evidence about how it might have looked like. The 360 photos of the current historical site were also helpful to get a sense of perspective. Overall, I could easily immerse myself.
+/-4) It has been critized that the model cannot be freely explored. I didn't expect this at all when I bought the app and think the predefined viewpoints fit perfectly (after all, it's like a guided tour). However, as I was standing there, I still thought it would be a very nice addition, and so I hope the producers will provide a freely explorable version some time in the future (as they have promised).","Apr 20, 2021 at 12:17 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:43:49.158359,PoolfanVr,Brings the forum to life,"I visited the forum many years ago and wish that I had experienced this application beforehand.  It is my favourite of the Rome Reborn series.  You are placed at several points at ground level around the forum and each position has commentary explaining what each building was and narrative on associated emporers.  As in the other Reborn Apps I have tried, the movement is restricted so you can only jump from place to place but I can live with that.

The graphics work well in the App and each building is brought to life with plenty of details - Again you can stand in a spot and have an image overlayed of how the forum looks today - it really brings it home how much has been unessesarily destroyed and pillaged over the centuries.

I hope that the Rom Reborn team have an ultimate goal of an entire VR recreation of ancient Rome where you can freely move about - that would be fantastic !","Jan 10, 2020 at 6:12 AM",5, 3,"Thank you for your kind words and positive review. We appreciate it! Stay tuned in 2020 for new apps from our company. Some will add to the Rome Reborn series, others will break new ground elsewhere."
2022-05-28 19:43:49.174317,Cubey,Interesting! But poorly implemented.,"This app lets you compare what Rome looked like historically and compare it with the present (ruins). Archeologically speaking, it's interesting. In terms of VR implementation, it's very poorly done.

What you get: 
* You can stand in several spots around the Roman forum and see a 360-degree spherical photo of the modern ruins. Click a button to switch between the photo and the computer rendering of ancient Rome.
* Some narrative ""tour guide"" audio describing the location without much depth.

What you DON'T get: 
* Freedom of movement. You're stuck in place. Viewpoints are offered, but you can't move around.
* 3D environment. This is a 2D image displayed as a 360-degree spherical view. You can look in all directions, but the images are not 3D.

I see that there are other Rome-themed offerings from this company, but I think I'll skip those.","Jul 8, 2019 at 8:11 AM",2, 9,
2022-05-28 19:43:49.189276,Matthewbrennan,Excellent Cultural Heritage VR,"There are not that many cultural heritage/history experiences on VR platforms, and many of the ones that are available are not scientifically vetted or accurate. Rome Reborn appears to have been created by a team of archaeologists using the latest research on art and architectural history and archaeology. There is even metadata and scientific documentation for the 3D models available on their website.

The architectural reconstructions appear very accurate and the audio content is incredibly detailed. If you want to learn about Ancient Rome and ancient Roman culture, politics, and architecture, there is not a better tool, VR or otherwise, than Rome Reborn VR. Recommended!","Dec 6, 2018 at 11:34 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:43:52.304552,kemcclin,Archaeologist Approved,"I took a six-week long summer school course in Rome in 2016, in which we learned about the topography and history of Rome. There was so much to learn and absorb; it would have been so great to have an app like this to review the content we learned on site after returning home. Beyond that, it is also now fantastic to be able to explore the site remotely while back in the States, when one gets Rome sick. Highly recommend for digital tourist or teaching purposes!","Nov 21, 2018 at 7:11 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:43:52.333474,PSCCLibraries,Start of something grand,"I am a college librarian, and our library brought this VR program into a Western Civ class. The students that participated really enjoyed their immersion into historic Rome, and the Time Warp feature was well received by the instructor and the students.

This program offers a lot of hope for the future, but it is not a complete enough experience to meet the demands of student engagement for a single program.

While this program is but a glimpse of what might come down the road with future Rome Reborn projects, I am encouraged by what this team is doing for the future of academic VR content. I encourage other educators looking for useful VR content in the classroom to look at purchasing some of the Rome Reborn projects and support this team. Especially when the programs are on a 4.99 sale price!","Oct 22, 2018 at 11:57 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:43:52.381345,ohgrant,,"A great idea, low resolution, dissapointing 3D. I think the devs should look at Nefertiti free app to see where they failed. This app is not worth money in the state it is in.  Lots of potential though.","Aug 30, 2018 at 9:32 AM",2, 25,
2022-05-28 19:43:52.399299,JPVR25,,"I went to the Roman forum and Believe that it could be improved. The people in the forum were dressed  in modern clothes which was distracting. However I did like the detail in the architecture.

I experienced the Palace of the Gods. First of all the graphics were incredible but i would like for a few things to be improved. The main flaw that stood out to me was the monotonous voice of the commentator, so my advice would be to place a summary in the site map for each location so people can experience the different places quickly and more effectively.

I watched one of the roads and I think the 3D experience is really good. I can feel how high the buildings are. I can also tell the road is tilted. I think the developer might can change the basket people are standing to the setting that people can walk everywhere and experience more. Just standing there kind of make people feel boring.  I think the overall 3D experience was very good just simply being able to travel to diffrent parts of the world, but one change I would suggest is the graphics.","Sep 7, 2018 at 4:09 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 19:43:52.418247,masing,A User Experience Designer Approves!,"I design user experiences for a variety of VR and AR platforms, and Rome Reborn has set a new bar in educational experience. The tour is immersive, and the information exhaustive without being exhausting. I especially enjoyed the handheld map as the guide to navigate around the city. I can't wait to see the new content and modules they produce!","Nov 21, 2018 at 6:51 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:43:55.519004,CKBrinkley,An Excellent Educational Tool,"I taught secondary school over five years, and home-schooled my daughter for ten. I often introduced educational computer games into her curriculum, to add some variety into the kinds of challenges she encountered. Rome Reborn is an excellent version of the same idea, but more immersive and engaging for a young audience. I so wish I had had something like this when I was teaching. Nevertheless, it's great to get to enjoy it now! Highly recommend for homeschool teachers out there.","Nov 21, 2018 at 6:47 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:43:55.534961,SACB221,Roman Archaeology - Digital Version,"I am a graduate student in Roman Archaeology, soon to graduate and begin a career in academia. It is so exciting to see tools like this being developed that I can use in the classroom. The content for this app is first rate, and exhaustively researched. Other such apps may crop up, but I highly doubt any will be so carefully produced by actual scholars in the field. Highly recommend this app to instructors at the collegiate and secondary school levels!","Nov 21, 2018 at 7:02 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:43:55.550918,tiandou,Great Exploration...,"I enjoyed wandering around the Roman Forum digitally with this app. I've never been to Rome, but it was so neat to see it virtually, and learn about the culture. Highly recommend for the world traveler who can't leave home every week. Also, to see it as the ancient Romans might have. So. Cool.","Nov 21, 2018 at 6:56 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:43:55.566876,carlpalt,Digital Humanities Comes to Oculus,"I am a digital humanities researcher, and frequently teach courses on both Italy and Italian. This app is an excellent way to virtually introduce students to the ancient culture of Italy, and show them around the city of Rome. The app is constantly being loaded with new content, from current views of the city to ancient history modules where students can learn about Roman history, culture, and society. I highly recommend for instructional purposes, as well as sheer enjoyment of learning about Rome. While it's not always possible to take a group of my students to Italy, this is a great way to accomplish the same thing virtually!","Nov 21, 2018 at 6:33 PM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 19:43:58.663739,Anomalous2141,Not Worth the Money,"The still images in boring 2D on your computer screen?  That's basically the game.  It's a collection of 360 images that you can select and view while listening to someone talk about them.  No sense of scale, no immersion, and the photographs are particularly bad.  Stay away, and stay away hard.","Sep 10, 2018 at 9:48 AM",1, 1,"Hi, thank you very much for reviewing our application! Rome Reborn VR is an enormous urban model with lots of geometry, textures, and several LODs. It is only because of circumstances beyond our control that we are unable to offer our users the same pleasure we ourselves enjoy in our office of being able to move freely through virtual Rome. But, be assured: this is a high priority for us, so please stay tuned! 

We have made our apps available now as 360 panoramas on the theory that ""something is better than nothing"" and so that we can begin to build a Rome Reborn community and get reactions and suggestions from users like you about new features you would like to see us offer. We will be taking on board your ideas and suggestions to the greatest extent possible. In the meantime, you can help get us to the day when free roaming is possible by buying our apps now and by spreading the word about Rome Reborn VR. Thank you!  

For more on this issue, please see the sixth FAQ on our website (https://www.romereborn.org/content/faq)."
