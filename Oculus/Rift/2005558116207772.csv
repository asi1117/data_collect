2022-05-28 19:47:12.689983,ElusiveMarlin,Superb Retro fun in VR,"I really enjoyed this game in my youth on the Amiga back in the day, and am absolutely loving this VR re-imagining.

Just goes to show, you dont need million £ budgets with AAA graphics to have a great time in VR.

As TMXMRA stated earlier, I too would have happily paid for this game, so to get it for free is an absolute steal!

Well done Team Galaxy!","Jan 19, 2021 at 10:05 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:47:12.705941,tmxmra,Really fun VR remake of a classic game.,"This game is really great, I would happily have paid a few pounds for it and still given 5 stars.

Its not overly complicated, but if you ever played and enjoyed Gravity Force on the Amiga then you should really appreciate this game.

If this game concept it totally new to you, you may find it a little quirky for the modern day, but give a little time to get used to the control and you should be rewarded with hours of fun.

Finding this one made my day!","Dec 3, 2020 at 2:57 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:47:12.721897,Mahed,Solid game with lots of content,"In Galaxy Forces you navigate a ship through the levels while avoiding enemies and other obstacles. There are two game modes, race and mission. Both modes are quite enjoyable but if you are up for a challenge I would suggest trying some of the later mission-levels. Its obviously a solid game with lots of work put into it. And since it is also free I dont see any reason for not trying.","Jul 10, 2020 at 10:28 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:47:12.738962,Shakagenghis,"VR? A flat game, not in space either!","Needs more.  It just really isn't a VR game, it is a flat game with a little bit of visual depth due to being in VR.  In fact, IT IS NOT A SPACE SHOOTER EITHER.  It is an 80s computer game inside a cave, where you just race against your old time.  It is AWFUL.  If it is a flat game it needs something compelling to keep you interested, not just beat your best time.  The ship should be leveled up, unlockables, maybe an adventure, maybe a story.  More art, more puzzling, just something to make it more than just a basic flat game.  These headsets aren't fun to wear, there needs to be a reason.","May 12, 2020 at 11:12 PM",1, 0,"Sorry that you hate it. The game is what it is, and that is a free fully playable VR shooter in 55 alien space caves, where you can compete on the global hiscore list."
2022-05-28 19:47:12.757308,bigmike20vt,It is Gravity Force but in VR.,"If like me you are an old gubber who fondly remembers playing games like Gravity Force or Jet Pac on the 8bit / 16 bit machines and would like to play again but with a VR twist..... Then what are you doing reading this?, just buy it!.
The game on the surface of it is quite simple, fly your ship to landing pads, pick up cargo and drop off on another pad without hitting scenery, getting shot or running out of fuel..... However there are some tight squeezes, your ship gets more and more sluggish as it carries more weight and the levels can be quite tricky.
Add to this there are gold, silver and bronze time targets as well as a scoreboard to test your mettle against other meat sacks (players). It all plays just as good as it should and when you fail, it is completely fair and it is easy to learn from mistakes.
The gold time goal can be brutal, indeed I quickly gave up going for gold.

IF I had 1 minor criticism the visuals are a bit samey (that said I have not seen all the levels) and I would have liked some different cargo. (1 similar variant of the game back in the day had some cargo we had to carry on a long tether which swung around like a giant wrecking ball, pulling your ship with it.  I think something like that on some levels may have added some much appreciated variation.

But for the price of a premium pint of beer, it aint going to break the bank. If the premise interests you give it a look.","Sep 23, 2019 at 10:00 PM",4, 9,
