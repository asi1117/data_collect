2022-05-28 19:34:45.948971,McGraw6917,Pointless,I don't understand what is the point to this demo.? All I can do is stand in a black room with 2 chalk boards telling what to do with the controls and I can turn the TV on. Thats it. I must be doing something wrong because it doesn't match the trailer to this demo game.,"Apr 25, 2021 at 1:31 PM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 19:34:45.964928,whitegreyblack,"Movement awkward, sound fixed, not bad!","Updated and increased to 4 stars: The dev's speed and willingness to update the title based on feedback is pretty inspiring. I have not had time to test the new movement option (based on head direction vs. being based on hand direction) but that was my main issue and the fact that they patched in the option gets extra marks from me.

Updated review and upped to 3 stars: The free movement option still feels restrained and slowed by the character animation (not in a consistent way) and therefore makes it feel awkward and causes a bit of nausea at times. Quite often when you press the analog stick in one direction, your movement may move in a completely different direction than expected and it makes you feel immediately ""off"". While you can switch to teleportation I'd rather the free motion feel more intuitive.

The sound issue that was happening previously has now been patched and corrected so I was able to complete the prologue. It's a nice teaser for the world the devs have built and I'm definitely more interested in the full game now after finishing the prologue. The voice acting is a bit lackluster and the hand controls also felt stilted. There's something here, but the execution leaves a bit to be desired. I will likely try the full game regardless and see whether the full game shows more polish and makes good on its premise.","Sep 4, 2019 at 12:11 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:34:45.982881,Friesko,"Quality game, movement makes me nauseous","Quality game with an interesting story. It would get a 5 star rating if 'teleportation' was a way of moving around, because movement controlled by the thumbsticks makes me nauseous after a while. This 'fix' would convince me to buy the full game.","Jun 7, 2019 at 5:38 AM",4, 3,"Hi, thanks for your feedback! 
Teleportation already added! Hope that you will be pleased to progress through PROZE as it best fits your level of comfort."
2022-05-28 19:34:46.015792,Zapious,Well it was good until the Update,"The game played fine when I first got it. I was able to use the fire extinguisher to get the cables. (after hitting my ceiling a few times with my hands) The only thing that bugged me was the knobs on the squealing machine. They jumped all over when I was trying to turn them.  I just played it today, after 3 big updates, and like others, my sound no longer works in the game.  :(","Jun 6, 2019 at 9:49 AM",3, 0,"Hi, Finally, we resolved issue when sound does not work. Update is already available."
2022-05-28 19:34:46.031749,ThreeStretch,Achievements Now  fixed..,"Acheivements in the demo are now fixed which is awsome, this was my pretty much only gripe about this game, but i currently have an audio issue in game where no sound can be heard via Rift audio. A great puzzler  well thought out and very much worth playing. 4 stars awarded.","May 19, 2019 at 5:07 PM",4, 2,"Hi, Finally, we resolved issue when sound does not work. Update is already available."
2022-05-28 19:34:49.136553,FunFury,This is great!,"Pros:
-Good graphics for a VR Game
-Has an interesting story behind it
-Good voice acting
-Good Audio
-No instructions. Personally I like that. Makes the feel of the game better
-Menu with movement options and full body avatar switch.

Cons:
Prologue is a bit short, but it's free and is a teaser for the full game PROZE: Enlightenment, and it is already out: https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1942869395829207/","May 3, 2019 at 4:51 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:34:49.152511,Mr_Wonderfull,Cuyler,The game was really fun but it was pretty difficult and challenging but enjoyable I hope the make the full game soon I really am looking forwards playing it no matter the price,"Apr 11, 2019 at 1:01 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:34:49.170463,FMLPhoto,Not for short ceilings,"I've got about 10 minutes into it and there's a scene where you need to get a pair of cables to advance.  After spending most of that time looking for a way to knock those cables down, I looked for a walkthrough and it shows that you literally have to jump up to get those.  My ceiling is 6'3"" and I'm 6 foot.  So, I'll never get to finish this game, unfortunately.  Lots of great atmosphere and theming, but relying on me to have a larger space than I do is a literal game stopper.","Feb 19, 2019 at 12:41 PM",3, 0,"Hi, thanks for playing. Jumping after the cable is the last thing we intended the player to do). There is a pipe in the room that you can use to reach the cables. Other pickable objects like fire extinguishers will work as well. Hope that helps. Have a good one)"

2022-05-28 19:34:49.201885,Zenbane,Great transitions!,"First off, I am giving this 3 out of 5 stars because of the controls. Trying to grab objects (especially the point-n-click aspect) isn't very refined. Also, when another character talks to you, they don't look directly at you based on where you are in the VR space. Instead, they look at a pre-defined location. Other than that though... this was a fantastic experience. There are 2 major transitions in the game. One in the beginning (going from a dark room to a light room), and one towards the end. This felt very unique, and I would love to see more from this studio.","Jan 14, 2019 at 11:53 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 19:34:52.327855,Bro3ep,"Graphics, Sounds, Gameplay - all superb!","A good story game demo, based on true events that happened in the 70’s around DUGA station somewhere in the snowy USSR.
I felt myself a Soviet engineer while messing with all that retro-futuristic stuff: radio lamps, oscilloscope, supercomputer, cables, tools...
NPC engagements were pretty good. 
I had fun playing prologue and intrigued to play the full game when it comes out.","Nov 16, 2018 at 10:49 PM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 19:34:52.341818,Scooby-Doo,DON'T DOWNLOAD!,"1: The game literally makes no sense
2: No instructions just wants you to figure out everything
3: Hands are not placed where my controllers are
4: The movement will make you sick aswell as the turning
Literally unplayable... you'll have to keep clicking B (reset rotation) because the game doesn't do roomscale so you'll have to use the controller to walk everywhere. Everytime you pick ANYTHING UP your controller Will Vibrate and there is no way to turn it off in the settings. Please don't download this... if there was ratings lower than a 1 star I would have put it as that...","Nov 15, 2018 at 9:49 AM",1, 13,
2022-05-28 19:34:52.356778,DustyinLVNV,Promising?,"Each time I started, I started under the floor. Resetting view would fix this issue. If I pressed X on the controller, suddenly I would arrive to the floor. I had downloaded this and forgot about it and thought it was a one room demo room when I started it and didn't realize what I was supposed to be doing. After finishing the room, it was one hell of a few outside. I may get this game after seeing reviews of the full game.","Jan 4, 2019 at 8:33 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:34:52.372735,Totius,Very good,"It has great potential! I hope developers will put a lot of work into this, but I can easily see how it can go wrong.. The experience should be smooth, long enough and detailed. Unforyunately this depends a lot on the budget that will be put into this. 
For the moment the defects of the prologue are: 1) bit too short (but it's perfectly fine considering it is free); 2) controls are not always very responsitives 3) textures can be better 4) puzzles might be a bit easier, or some help might be provided to whom does not want to spend too much time with them and instead enjoy the story","Nov 18, 2018 at 7:43 AM",5, 7,

2022-05-28 19:34:55.475023,Justyn87,My cables keep glitching through floor.,"I love the graphics, gameplay and puzzles but half the time my cables glitch out of the game and fall through the floor due to their strange physics behavior. I try to set them down and even then one fell through the floor. Also they get stuck on things while walking and then their elasticity makes them fling into the ceiling on the opposite side of the room.","Dec 11, 2018 at 9:05 AM",3, 3,"Hi, Thanks for playing.
We have fixed this bug with cables. You are welcome to update and try again."

2022-05-28 19:34:55.506938,ChrisPbaconVR,No guidance,"the environment and setting do seem interesting and engaging, however there is no real guidance or obvious objectives in this game. I found that the only way to realy progress at anything is to just press everything. reading and interecting with everything i saw still left me completly clueless as to what to do. there is a checklest right at the start of the game, but why even include that if it has nothing to do with what im doing in the room. how am i supposed to know what to tune the radio to... why is there clearly a missing peice but the same object that clearly fits im not able to pick it up. the cables that are color matched to where they connect does not seem to apply for the yellow and red cable.. there are many things that get confusing fast. this game could be great but it realy does need some better clues for us idiots.","Dec 12, 2018 at 10:27 AM",1, 0,"Hi, thanks for your feedback. It is very important to us. We've made some adjustments and improvements to the game. We've added more clues to the puzzles and fixed few bugs. Also added subtitles. You are welcome to try it. Have fun!"
2022-05-28 19:34:55.522403,AirwolfPL,Promising,"It's pretty good for a prologue. Will suit both the standing and sitting gameplay. Thumbstick movement (thank god, no teleportation) makes for a satisfactory experience. And it's yet another (after Red Matter and Interkosmos) game which makes fun of the idiocracy in the USSR and current Russia so yeah, I will make sure to check out the full version.","Nov 29, 2018 at 6:59 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 19:34:55.537363,Dyslogix,What is this? lol,"It's a puzzle game with no instructions or any form of helpful dialogue, i mean, it's not bad, but it's not good. If i'm to get my teeth stuck into a particular game, it has to have at least a general idea of what i'm supposed to do :) 
Ok, it has the making of a decent little puzzler game, but a short list as a tutorial or even a hints log, would fit nicely :) Graphically, it's nice, playability it's one i'll try once a few patches are in place :) 
Best of luck","Nov 16, 2018 at 2:55 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 19:34:58.653122,Parallaxed,Fun short puzzle,"I broke the demo and got stuck because at one point I was trying to do something that I wasn't supposed to.  Once I figured out the ""proper way"" it was a lot of fun to finish.  Definately worth a download.  Looking forward to learning more about the full version.","Nov 24, 2018 at 1:21 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 19:34:58.668082,Patrn_Flyr,Needs teleport mode,Some people are very sensitive to the type of motion that is available in this game.  Most games give you this direct movement and an option for teleport which works better for many.  I played for about 10 minutes.  Graphics look nice.  Can't really comment on the quality of the puzzles as the motion sickness made me stop.,"Nov 27, 2018 at 8:46 PM",3, 0,

I think its better than some escape the room type puzzle games i've paid for.  Only issue is i don't like the DOF effect & would rather there was an option to disable it. I also found a bug when retreiving one of the plugs (it dissapeared) unless thats part of the puzzle.","Nov 17, 2018 at 5:40 PM",4, 4,

A compact story-driven exploration experience Not very long game, but kept me well hooked.

Can heartily recommend to anyone interested in conspiracies, history and especially the Soviet secret experiments.
Gameplay wise it was a perfect fit for me, as the puzzles were not too easy and not to complex.
