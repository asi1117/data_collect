Oculus Touch controllers did work on our end and nobody else has encountered the problem so far. Some things you could try:
1. Check if your Oculus drivers are on the newest version (an update was just released a few hours ago).
2. Unplug all other headsets (if you had any plugged into your PC).
3. Restart your PC.
Also, inside the Oculus app, you can check ""Devices"" on the left side to see if any problems occurred. We hope it works now!"
2022-05-28 19:10:44.406372,neuoc,would be five...,"this game is honesty great and its a load of fun. The driving is amazing and there is a ton of content including playing vr in the houses your robbing, a very well designed game but theres just one issue i had. That was the controls they just seem a little off and could use a little work, devs please fix the controls then the game would be a five.


My response to the devs: Thank you for being so active with your community, these are some tweaks you could make in my opinion the driving acceleration would be more comfortable if it was the trigger. And the other thing i would reccomend you add asside from controls is instead of when you pick up the item your supposed to steal, you could pull a backpack off your back and put it in there. Thanks for being so open to ideas.","Nov 29, 2019 at 5:48 AM",4, 12,Thanks for your amazing and honest review. We just updated the game - you can now switch your controls while driving (there is a button in the car). Enjoy!
2022-05-28 19:10:44.421331,FastLawyer,GTA clone falls flats on its face,"I don't know what is up with the good reviews, but this isn't a good game. It's rather bland and mediocre in almost every regard. The stealth sections lack depth and the gun mechanics need a lot of work.

2022-05-28 19:10:44.435294,TarzaV,Super Annoying Do not buy,"This game isn't worth 10 euros. There are so many dumb levels which are really difficolt in a bad way. And I don't mean in a way which you need to get better at the game. In the level 6 you're at a far, and there is a grandpa with a gun patrolling the area. If the grandpa sees you it's game over, but not imediatly. he takes like 3 seconds untill he shoots you. and the things you need to steel changes every time you try again, so thats  allso dumb. I wish I could get a refund","Oct 6, 2019 at 6:43 PM",1, 13,
2022-05-28 19:10:44.450254,Jaxrud,Fun little game and idea,"I do wish there was small minor things to do in the world besides doing the main objectives. And I was surprised that some things were impossible to pick up, but a nearly identical item next to it could. 
I also noticed some issues with opening drawers where the point of attachment to the hands were not on the handle but on the inside of the drawer, making it break immersion when closing drawers as you have to shove the hands inside the cabinet/tabletop. The closet doors seemed to be fine though, so it's probably a minor issue to fix the pivot point the hand snaps to for drawers. 

I did like the movement system as well, I hate it in games that only moves you in the direction you're looking, I like to be able to look freely as I'm moving around. However, when moving around physically there didn't seem to be any barriers as I could stick my head through the wall, or if I moved in real life, and started walking around, the collision box weren't on me it seemed, and that could be a little disorienting or a small annoyance. 
I really enjoy the game and the idea of it though, so with some smaller improvements and quality of life additions this could really be a 5/5 for me.","Oct 3, 2019 at 10:04 AM",4, 7,Thanks for your awesome review! We fixed the drawer and are trying to rework the collision for the player. An update will come within the next few days or on our big upcoming patch day (probably on the 15 of October).
2022-05-28 19:10:47.560934,LaggedBan,Pretty Bad.,"I bought this game with a lot of hope, seeing the reviews and the artstyle was so promising. I thought I was getting a game that was polished and well made, but my hope immediatley took a nose dive. Completing the first two missions was in absolute bore, with extremely bad AI, terrible sound effects, glitches with movement alone, and voice acting being a complete train-wreck. I am giving this game two stars because of the visuals and how much work went into the outside barrier of the map. Such detail that must have taken so long, but its blocked with an immediate restart level barriar making it utterly pointless. So many oppurtunites missed, this game focused to much on making a ""playable"" game and not making small features, like eating food around the house, interactable map features that are not needed to further progress toward the end of the level, and hidden easter eggs that can appear as oculus home items or just achievements in general.. So many times, in this game I got excited to explore the map! level 2 had another market, but it was only there to get one item which was the floppy disk. Level 3, The car driving in my opinion, is quite terrible. AI again, aka the police, were terrible. I was getting killed by them when they were twenty feet behind me and the turning is quite bad, everytime I turn it just drifts and makes me lose all acceleration. I am also giving this game two stars because of the supportive devs, before I bought the game I saw many reviews have problems with motion and in-game bugs, the devs immediately responded respectfully... AND IMMEDIATLEY FIXED THIS PROBLEM. Clap and a half for the devs for being so supportive, I hope they read this review and they don't think its hating on the game, I hope they fix the problems I have stated and add more in-game features. In my opinion, this would really help attract people to the game seeing as its cost is decent with a game filled with hidden easter eggs and a interactable map.","Sep 12, 2019 at 8:50 AM",2, 3,"Thank you for your detailed review of our game. Sure, the first level is pretty boring, it was mainly meant to be a tutorial. The AI from the first few levels is also pretty simple-minded because the game should start slow. We already planned to change some points you named: a new voice actor and the movement mechanics. The game currently offers some easter eggs and secrets which can be found but no Home items or achievements yet. We will definitely work on that. We are trying to create a pleasant experience for everyone, but we are not an AAA-Studio. Keep an eye open for updates, we will certainly integrate a lot of the features you named."
2022-05-28 19:10:47.575894,onesmashedbro,Honestly one of the better titles out,"This game is one of those rare titles you come across and don't expect much, especially being priced so low. I was very suprised when I first started playing the game and I started to see just how much content you were getting for the money you spent. You would think, low price, low content, right? Wrong.

Some missions you are sniping out of a helicopter, some missions you are driving ( and I mean actual, steering wheel and working braking/gas systems driving) and running from the police, some missions you are sneaking through houses stealing goods, stealing cars, climbing up through windows. 

This list could go on and on but importantly, if you buy this game, realize it is definitely still a work in progress and has a long way to go, but if you buy it now you are getting a hell of a bang for your buck, and you can cop it up before its full release ( where the price most certainly will be higher). You will not regret it and what I love most about this game is it has a lot of stuff and mechanics you just do not see often in VR games which keeps its refreshing, along with constant updates from the devs. A week ago I was playing this game thinking, man I wish there was thumbstick support for movement. Log in today and suprise ! thumbstick support added ! So if this game is this much fun now, and worth every penny, imagine a few weeks or even a few months from now , I am STOKED.","Jul 12, 2019 at 7:05 PM",5, 20,
2022-05-28 19:10:47.590854,Multinator,,"It's like GTA, Thief Simulator, Hello Neighbor and Payday had a weird baby

I really like the cartoonish look of the game. Some missions are difficult but they are all fun. The game is really diversified and every mission takes you to a different setting. It's kind of a weird mix, the first part of the game feels like Thief Simulator or Hello Neighbor and then it takes you to GTA V with crazy police chases and robbing/killing people and the last bit feels like Payday. The voice acting is satisfying but not perfect, kind of weird and cringy like Arizona Sunshine.","Jul 5, 2019 at 12:30 AM",5, 21,

Still, we will continue to work on updates and new content for the game."
2022-05-28 19:10:47.621771,RequestingMayday,Needs movement and collision work,"I wanted to love this game but after 5 minutes it became unplayable. I did not like the arm swinging movement so I switched to thumbstick movement. Well I ended up getting stuck in a dresser and in the stairs, my character would drift in weird directions, almost like I was drunk. The graphics look good and I'm sure it is a fun game, but the drifting and lack of good collision boundaries made it totally unplayable for me","Aug 10, 2019 at 9:57 PM",2, 2,"We are sorry to hear that you had problems with our game. We looked into the problems you described and just released a patch (Update 1.9.1) which improves Thumbstick movement. You won't get stuck in drawers, chairs or other small props again (only walls, cars, wardrobes). The Stairway from level 1 was also fixed. Also, note that you can choose between movement types inside the menu. You can switch between controller-based or camera/HMD-based movement (besides arm-swinging and teleportation) - the drunken/wacky movement you described is caused by not pointing the controller into any direction when using the controller-based movement type. We hope that helps - have fun!"
2022-05-28 19:10:50.723475,Darko_,,"I like to play new games on the Oculus Store and see what little indie developers are doing. This game was at the top, and I thought I'd give it a try.  This game has a very own running mechanic, where I have to say that this is also a good alternation of teleporting or generally moving only by the joystick. Of course, Sprint Vector has something similar, but I have to say that this mechanic is very well implanted in this game. There is also a passage where you drive a car. Also this mechanic is really funny when you first get the hang of it. Of course, I also know stealth or thief games from the non-VR and have always wondered what that would look like in the Vr. This game offers a very good representation of this genre in the VR. The levels are lovingly designed and of course I do not want to deny that I sometimes see a small bug, but these are more fun than bad and therefore do not see them as a problem that makes the game bad.

In summary, I can say that I really like the game. People who like to sneak through houses and want to steal things will love it.","Jul 8, 2019 at 9:50 PM",5, 8,

My Quick Thoughts:
This game gave me some really cool 'Hello Neighbor' type moments in VR, back before they patched VR out, and if you are looking for something you couldn't find in 'Rogan: The Thief in a Castle' then maybe this is something for you.","Jul 10, 2019 at 3:28 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 19:10:50.755390,Miyuka,,"It's more akin to those ""Find the Item"" picture puzzle games, just interactable with an enviroment. 

Though I hate to rate it lower since it's not friendly to those with motion sickness. There is no teleport movement so if you're prone to motion sickness, you might want to skip this. There is arm movement locomotion and joystick movement. Both of which are not very relieving.","Jul 14, 2019 at 9:29 AM",3, 4,"We are sorry that you got motion sickness from our game. We improved the arm-swinging and Thumbstick movement and also added teleportation movement. We hope that helps, have fun!"
2022-05-28 19:10:50.770350,jay4405,Dev support is amazing!!!,Love the new level 6 with the farmer having a shotgun. Love that when I complain about an issue they actually looked into it and took care of it. Seriously have tooken care of 3 issues so far. The game is a blast.,"Jul 19, 2019 at 4:37 AM",5, 10,
