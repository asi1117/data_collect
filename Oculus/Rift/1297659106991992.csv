2022-05-28 15:40:02.299858,Laudi,Meee,"This is one of the games that really breaks any imertion as you have to press jump button at the exact position otherwise jump does not exist in game,the same is valid for any other action. Played 1 hour and any room look like the one before. So to tell this is in one line then tomb raider means he has never played tomb raider. Now the bad control is not the worst, did you know the games where you played a scene 20 times and died over and over again without knowing what the game is expecting from you because even the hints followed does not change anything? That's the point where i told my self to stop waist my time with this.","Aug 22, 2019 at 1:55 AM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 15:40:02.315816,RuneSR2,Enter the true Tomb Raider Experience!,"It's one of the most beautiful games on the Rift, but only when using very high levels of super sampling (ss). Also it's one of the most hardware demanding games, even worse than Seeking Dawn. Using ss 1.0 (default) a GTX 1060 will not even provide 90 fps, but 45 fps. I'm using a heavily oc'ed GTX 1080 and i7 7700K and I just barely get 90 fps ss 1.0. Ss 1.2 gives me 45 fps, but ss 2.0 looks astonishingly awesome and still gives me 45 fps - so it's basically 90 fps + super-blurry game-ruining ss 1.0 or 45 fps super-beautiful ss 2.0. But 45 fps is not a problem, because only you and your opponents move - usually (surroundings are fixed). I greatly enjoyed playing this game using ultra-sharp super-realistic ss 2.0 (asw 45 fps). This is a 3rd person action adventure just like Tomb Raider. In many ways the game play is much like the original 3dfx Voodoo Graphics Tomb Raider from 1996. Remember that not much did happen in Tomb Raider - it was primarily about exploring the world - but yes, you did encounter some wolves before meeting a truly terrifying opponent. Thesues is like a true copy of such awesome game play. In the start it's like an interactive movie, but the peace won't last. This is a must-have for Rift owners, if you have the hardware to make the game truly come alive - and yes, RTX 2080 Ti is not at all wasted on this game ;-) The game is just a 998MB download, but textures look better than many 20+ GB games. It would be great if the devs could optimize this game much more - I get the feeling that quite a lot could be done in this regard (this game is about twice as hardware demanding as Lone Echo if you want 90 fps).","Jan 17, 2019 at 7:02 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 15:40:02.345736,vournazos61,It's not short. You have to play 2x's,"I have played hundreds of games. Going off of other peoples reviews I was hesitant to buy this game but I am glad I did. I have played Chronos. I have played Edge of Nowhere. I love third person games. But Chronos and Edge of Nowhere didn't really have anything extra for me the second time around. This game does. You do not get the full game or the full story if you only beat the game one time. When you beat it the first time it implys you must play it again. And when you do play it a second time things are different. Not at first so dont exspect to start it the second time and for it to be comepletely different. You have to play to a certain point. Then there will be puzzles in the labrinth. You will be able to access places you could not get to the first time around. And if you find all these places the ending will change and you will find the truth about this game and when and where it takes place. Be wary of reviews that do not mention this. They obviouslly missed the point of the game and the hints that there was more to it. Play it. Enjoy it. beat it and then go back and play it again. The ending is not what you think. 

The games looks great. The game plays well. I am going to show this game to my brother. I know he will love the art style. It looks beautiful. If you are not sure what to do the second time around message me. It is pretty obvious though when you get to the area where the labrinth will try to trick you. I am glad I bought this game and would love to see more from this team. It was worth the full price I paid. Thanks devs. Keep up the good work.","Nov 26, 2017 at 7:07 PM",5, 52,
2022-05-28 15:40:05.461402,JJFair,Could have been great,"The graphics are nice, however the developers ruined their own game by not allowing you to control the toon how you would like to causing frustration. You cannot jump out of the way when you are about to get crushed or try to pass under a stone gate to avoid being crushed. You are forced to play by their script or not at all. This could have been a fantastic third person game but they cut themselves off at the knees for not doing it right. People have complained that you cannot look around as the toon walks in the direction you look. I find if you stop then look you don't have a problem seeing the world. I really like the music and the graphics and the camera angles as you go through the maze, but since you cannot control the toon how you would like , I give it three stars.","Jan 6, 2018 at 1:37 PM",3, 7,
2022-05-28 15:40:05.476362,Falcon_DS_,Minimalist but satisfying,"Well, I was enjoying it (apart from the fact that your character turns in the direction you are looking, so you can't walk in a straight line while admiring the scenery or looking for clues) until the point where he falls from a crumbling ledge and I got a fatal crash every time saying ""Pure virtual function being called while application was running (GlsRunning ==1)"".  Restarting the game didn't fix it but luckily after a restart of the PC I got past that point and to the end.   From a brief search on the Internet this appears to be an Unreal Engine issue that affects a few different games from time to time.  The game itself is minimalist in every way; environment, enemies and short in length, but the atmosphere and tension carries it pretty well and is quite enjoyable overall…","Dec 27, 2017 at 1:52 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 15:40:05.505285,Azazel08,Greek goodness,"I really liked this game and I still feel like I got my money's worth from my playtime with it, but I do have a couple of suggestions for the Devs.
1. Please let us move our heads around more. The greatest advantage that VR provides is immersion. You have created a beautiful world that has piqued my interest. However, I get a headset out of bounds warning whenever I want to look at almost anything. I appreciate you are looking out for the safety of you consumers, but we have a guardian system that allows us to know where our boundaries are. We don't need your artificial boundary limiting us from simply looking down or wanting to turn around. 
2. If you could have added 2 or 3 more enemies and even just 1 more weapon you could possible double the length of the game and charge more for a fuller experience. This was an excellent first submission in the VR library of games. I hope you take your knowledge gained and continue developing for VR.","Nov 6, 2017 at 2:22 PM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 15:40:05.519248,Killmore101,Directx Error - can't launch game,"I can't get the game to start. It keeps asking me to install directx which I do. When I try to start the game again, it tells me to install it again but the only option available is ""uninstall"". Ugh...so many of the games I've bought on the Oculus store have had some sort of issue preventing me from enjoying my VR headset! Getting so tired of this.","Dec 8, 2017 at 7:42 AM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 15:40:08.617960,snowdog,Just My Cup Of Tea!,"I've only just started playing this game so I MAY be jumping the gun a bit here but right from the start of the game you know that this is going to be a good quality game. The art is phenominal as is the third person perspective view. No camera issues so far and for my money there aren't enough third person games in VR so far. It's looking like your typical action adventure game, which is a GOOD thing, with exploration, puzzles and combat, exactly the sort of game that floats my boat. It looks like there's been at least 2 years hard work put into this game by a talented team of artists and designers. The game is beautiful.","Dec 11, 2017 at 4:05 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 15:40:08.647880,RansonMartin,Great Graphics and Immersive Gameplay,"This game has a great style and i personally love the 3rd person camera view, the torch and sword fighting scenes are great fun and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun, 3rd person VR experience","Dec 10, 2017 at 9:02 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:40:08.662840,ParadiseDecay,1st Impressions + Video with Commentary!,"My Initial Thoughts:
In Theseus you find yourself in a mythical world full of strange beasts based on Minotaur lore. A mysterious spirit becomes your guide as you seek out and explore this magical world. You progress through the world by climbing, jumping and crawling through each scene. Most of the time the camera is fixed, but on occasions it follows the main character over the shoulder. In order to progress you will need to find torches to burn down barriers and find weapons to defend yourself against the creatures that attack you in the game. So far I have only come across giant spiders and the Minotaur. The AI is very clever and will react to your actions, I did die a few times and noticed that the AI was not scripted, on my 2nd attempt at a scene I noticed that they attacked from different locations and in different groups. I was really impressed with this. The first thing that hits you when you play this title is the stunning graphics and locations. I instantly had Chronos crossed with Tomb Raider vibes. These types of game just go to show how amazing 3rd person adventures are in VR. You really do get immersed in these types of environments and worlds. Everything about this game just oozes class, quality and polish from its superb animations and outstanding creatures. If you enjoyed Chronos and wanting more of the same I would seriously consider you look at this.

2022-05-28 15:40:08.678797,Nicodemas.Rexx,GREAT GAME but...,"This is my first review... I own over 50 games for my Oculus Rift over many a different genre, yet games like Theseus are usually what I'm playing in my free time. I played Chronos for hours and loved it, and this game plays very much the same. I feel there is SO much potential for games like this, as long as they expand and innovate a bit more. I found myself saying "".... man, if they would only add _______!"" or "" I wish I could ______ in this game!"" Not to the point that it affected whether I would play it or not, but, let me just say, for a game to hold my attention long enough for my to finish it,,, THAT's sayin' something right there!                                             

I came away from Theseus feeling like they could have added more weapon and item variety and function, and definitely some more story or plot. This game, however, had the polished graphics, but no weapon or item menu, no skill tree, no Exp points, set in a gorgeous , albeit small, world. Unfortunately, the deep and involved story I find myself pining for was pretty much non-existent... 

Don't get me wrong, the game was pretty awesome, I played it all the way thru to the end, but I just felt like I was in the tutorial phase of the game, just waiting for that next enemy to drop a new weapon, or some fight come up that would require me to learn a new skill. But it never came... So I feel like, as short as it was, it ended just in time. 

If this development team could just add a deeper plot, more than one type of enemy, and some type of player progression,,,, Then I could see this game being up there as one of the best VR experiences in its particular genre....
OVERALL: I enjoyed the game very much... but just came away wanting more! For under 20$, it is a must-buy! Especially if, like me, you've beaten Chronos, & you're just waiting for a AAA RPG VR experience!","Oct 29, 2017 at 2:36 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:40:11.767536,grekb,Could be better,"First of all the game has some pretty good graphics, especially the shadow/light effects do give a nice atmosphere. Thats almost all the good stuff about this game... Unlike Edge of Nowhere, the game doesnt follow your character, instead you pretend to be a fixed camera somewhere in the room. That makes the immersion even less than EoN, down to garbage. The controls are not really good because you need to be in the specific spot to actually interact, and with the fixed camera style its just bad. You will want to break the controler when you will be fighting monsters because THERE IS NO WAY your character can face where you want him to face. Clear frustration there with the controls. The game could have  been so much better if the devs were actually playing their own games! P.S. The greek language that is supposed to be heard from Ariadne is pure google translation from english, nothing to worry about that, just saying...","Oct 30, 2017 at 1:33 AM",3, 1,
