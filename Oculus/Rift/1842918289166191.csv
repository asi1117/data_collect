2022-05-28 21:01:55.724975,Timm129,Very well made,"The gameplay is fantastic with an extremely simple concept and only one game mode, but it was very well  made. Starts off very easy but quickly escalates in difficulty after just a few minutes. Makes it fun to beat your high scores and compete on the leaderboards.","Nov 30, 2020 at 7:09 AM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 21:01:55.753897,Satconcook,,Simple bit of fun. It has achievements and leaderboards. I may be a bit bias as I provided some valuable feedback and now have an achievment named after me and my dog is a piece of art in the background. Developers are awesome and love to hear your feedback.,"May 22, 2020 at 1:45 PM",5, 15,

My Initial Thoughts:
It's OK for a FREE educational style wave shooter, but nothing special.","May 6, 2020 at 11:52 PM",3, 10,
