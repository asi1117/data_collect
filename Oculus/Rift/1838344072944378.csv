2022-05-28 18:36:01.239098,Caesar_salad,Very cute short game,"I personally loved this game, I think it was a very creative idea, that they executed pretty well. I do feel like they slightly overplayed the comedic aspect of the game, there were some funny lines though. The game wasn't super scary, so if you're looking for something to introduce you to horror, then this will work out great. I also think this game was rather short, but it was fun while it lasted. The last thing that I thought about the game was that the puzzles are a little hard to logically run though, like in the part of the game where you had to find the first security pin, and you found it on the body bag that had a piece of metal attached to it. I had to look up a tutorial to figure that out. But I really do suggest that you get this game, I really enjoyed playing it.","Nov 2, 2020 at 7:30 AM",4, 14,
2022-05-28 18:36:01.254058,HauntedFolly,A Short Jaunt Through Immersion,"This game may not last terribly long, with a full playthrough taking only a few hours.
But I consider this experience to be perfect for what it is.
It has a defined start and end, that leads you through to a sense of having completed the game. (Something I feel is lacking from many VR titles at the moment.)
The graphics are stylized and a bit cartoony, which lends a great sense of contrast to the game's actual tone and tension.
Sound design is good, thought nothing memorable sticks out in my mind beyond the character's voices.
Lighting work very well.
Gameplay is interesting, utilizing the hand puppet in a lot of ways I didn't expect.
Despite being short, I would say that this game deserves 5 stars.","Sep 16, 2020 at 1:18 AM",5, 9,

2022-05-28 18:36:04.374712,KatsuKumi,Please add subtitles,"A game with story based gameplay and a lot of dialogue like this one should really have subtitles, it's a standard in the video game industry.
As a non-English player, i really have a lot of troubles to understand the voice acting, the accent and the speed of dialogues are just way too much.
I really would like to play the whole game, but i feel like i'm missing a good part of the game if i can't understand everything.
Please add subtitles, at least, add english subtitles to the game.","Aug 10, 2020 at 4:28 PM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 18:36:04.389672,Nicron,Very fun but way too short,"This game made me feel paranoid about going around every corner, it was very enjoyable and the characters were very well played. Some of the puzzles were a bit difficult to solve which i would change. My only other complaints is the length of the game and the ending. It is a very short game which leaves you thinking “wait that was it?”. The ending although a good idea, i feel was badly executed and/or rushed. I would have also liked to see more of the characters mentioned in the game, and have a higher threat level going through the game. It is also quite buggy but nothing overly game breaking so not much of a complaint there. Overall would be 5 star if they didn’t have these issues.","Jun 23, 2020 at 8:01 PM",4, 10,

This one is forcing me to do it, is waaaay to good this game. I'm waiting for a second game, bigger, longer, with more lore about this world and the others important puppets that we didn't see on the game. I just f*king love it. Great job and i love Scout.

I agree with other comments the sprint time is too short i know its not important in this version as nothing requires you to really outrun anything but the constant re-sprinting gets old. My only real complaint about the game is it was just too short I didnt want it to end. Please make a nice long sequel for us to purchase and play Thanks in advance,"May 20, 2020 at 12:25 PM",5, 32,

It utilizes a good mix between comedy and horror which are things I love, the storytelling and mechanics of the game were something uniquely special to separate this game from a few others, and being a fan of the Muppets aswell as a few horror movies as a kid, this was amazing! The only thing I would point out is that the story should be a bit longer, and thats all really! Great job guys! ^^","Jun 15, 2020 at 5:59 AM",5, 9,

They are known for relative small Mobile VR Games.

2022-05-28 18:36:07.560191,Oathian,Interesting Story but Bugged,"I really enjoy the concept and mechanics used in this game. Pretty good amount of detail in the environments and characters. And the voice acting is wonderful. But I encountered a gamebreaking bug in the area with multiple puzzles you have to complete in order to advance to the next area. When trying to complete the puzzle in the room with the rats blocking the required item, I was somehow able to do the events out of order and I couldn't hit the button that was under the glass box. The bar blocking the wheel from turning retracted into the machine, but it still behaved as if the bar was blocking it. Really disappointed, but I don't want to start over to reach this point again. Maybe I'll try it again in a while.","Jun 22, 2020 at 11:12 PM",2, 0,

2022-05-28 18:36:07.589114,HummingBrawler-1,"Phenominal, wish it was longer though","My god I have never experienced chest tightening fear before in VR. it's  as long as it needs to be, but if it ever were to get a sequel, then I would hope that one is longer and with more stuff to find and do. the little ""sprint"" is about as fast as it should be for a horror game, but if you include sprint in a game at all then it needs to last longer and serve a purpose because you can get through most of the game without ever needing to sprint, that is if you figure out how to do it at all. the game never tells you how but you can increase movement speed by just a little bit by clicking down the control stick while moving forward. but like I said, it's basically pointless. The Monster designes are Unique and memorable in their uncanny designs, but if there are only going to be so many designs then a few unique death animations whenever you are caught would be appreciated. Character interaction was pretty good here, but next game it would be interesting if there was a little more to interacting or communicating with the puppets other than just the scripted yes or no dialogue options. But other than that, the controls are tight, load times are none existant and the main character of scout is extremely likable. can't wait for hello puppets 2 or whatever you guys have planned next.","Mar 11, 2020 at 9:00 AM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 18:36:10.688824,HorridDreams,It's Good In Places,"The direct horror aspect, the designs, and Scout's character are all amazing! Even when nothing is really happening it made me feel frightened for what I'd see next. But the game was incredibly buggy and felt lack luster in content. I had lots of bugs occur and by the time I beat the game I was asking myself ""Did my game bug out and skip content?"" and I checked. I didn't. I saw everything there was to see, secrets included, and it felt empty. It felt like it desperately wanted a story that it couldn't fufill. It's a really good outline of a game, but it desperately needs to be filled in.","Aug 6, 2020 at 4:15 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:36:10.702786,BolderDolter,Great game worth the price!,"An absolutely wonderful game! It really scared the everliving out of me in some parts, but I like how the game doesnt make it impossible to beat. The developers were obviously more focused on telling a story than gameplay. From the characters to the voice acting specifically, I really liked this game. The creep factor went up exponentially for me since I don't like dolls and mannequins. I found it by watching 8-BitRyan's playthrough on youtube, I wish more people did videos on these! There were a few bugs here and there though, so just be aware of that, but they are overlookable. Definitely worth the buy! :)","Mar 7, 2020 at 2:05 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:36:10.717746,ShiekHyrule,Pretty great unique horror experience,"The idea of having a hand puppet help guide you, is a really fun idea. It reminded me a bit of the anime Parasyte where the process of taking over the host didn't completely finish and now you have to rely on each other.

The voice acting is great, specially Scout who I really enjoy listening to, but I did have some trouble understanding one character and would be nice to include subtitles if possible. One other nitpick is that there is only snap turning, adding a smooth turning is a must IMO for VR games. 

I also have to give praise on the humor, which seems to be one of the hardest things to in video games where in most games it just falls flat, but yet this game pretty much nails it. 

So overrall I had a great time with the game, and hoping to see what else you guys have in store for the future.","Mar 2, 2020 at 5:22 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 18:36:10.733704,RamennBowls,"It's a great game, but..","I found this game, and it seemed amazing. Actually playing it was even better, its not that scary, but the funny kind of scary.

Unfortunately, I've encountered many bugs which has lead me to not only delete my saves but to reinstall the whole game. I quit the game asuming it saved, but when I came back, it seems that all the events, dialog, quests, etc had happened but all the props and objects reset. Relaunching the game many times, didn't fix it and apon deleting my save and starting from the beginning again, these issues still happened, when creating a new game I couldn't put on the puppet  without glitching it by waving both my arms around.

The issue that I kept having, was because all the events happened, but the probs reset.. trying to continue back to where you were as my save was a little behind, it would not let me interact with the probs again just like after the event has happened. It's quite hard to explain.

It's sad to see the amount of bugs and errors, but the concept of the game, style and everything was amazing!","Feb 25, 2020 at 12:32 AM",5, 4,Hi Roman!

All things that made a horror game great like jumpscares, lore, characters and much more were concluded in this game. I hope this game will have a sequel or smt like that.

2022-05-28 18:36:13.877296,holyraine1,"poorly made, too expensive","ok, before i list off all my problems with the game that makes me want to give it its 2 star rating, i would like to at least be fair and start off with all the things i liked about this game
firstly the graphics and character designs are pretty good, they kind of remind me of the muppets and are fairly well done
next is the concept, i thought that the idea of having your hand be a living puppet was an in interesting premise for a vr game, im surprised this hasnt been done before
i actually found myself really liking the puppet character, scout who is with you the entirety of the game, i really liked her personality
and thats about it for the positives, now lets talk about the negatives:
firstly this game is NOT scary, and for one reason, nothing happens when you die, when an enemy gets close to you the screen just goes red and you respawn back at a previous point, thats it. for an m-rated game this is surprisingly tame, i was expecting to see my guts ripped out or at least a jumpscare.
next lets talk about how poorly made the game is because GOOD GOD this game is poorly made, its littered with bugs that constantly forced me to close the game and reload the previous checkpoint. many puzzles can be interacted with in the order they werent meant to be, leading to them breaking. for example, i was at the point where i had to get the green piece of the badge to open the door, i came across ""the fun fountain confetti machine"" and i tried putting a key that i found in a shelf right below it into the key slot on the front of the machine, and even though i wasnt supposed to do that until i actually activated the device i was still able to put the key in, breaking the game.
also this game is way too short for its 20$ price tag, it should be 5-10 dollars at MOST for a game with 1 hour of average playtime
so yeah, this game is not worth it, dont but it unless if its on sale, i had a lot more to say about this game but i had to shorten it to be able to post on oculus","Jun 1, 2020 at 11:35 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 18:36:13.893253,Rhemora,"Great, just wish there was more","I deeply enjoyed the game. The art style, the humour, the creep factor. All was perfect in my eyes, the only part I did not enjoy was the shortness of the game. As I was getting deeply into this game unfortunately it was over, this usually would cause me to knock a star off but that in itself may drive people away from playing a game that they truly should and would truly enjoy. 

All in all if you are looking for a great world to play in and only have a few hours to yourself this is the game for you.","Feb 14, 2020 at 5:59 PM",5, 1,

1. The trigger areas go off when it shouldn't.
2. Certain task was not addressed properly in order to complete it.
3. Being able to disable certain comfert and also smooth rotation.

2022-05-28 18:36:17.031858,TheFox0,Hm...,"This is an interesting game for me. I don't usually get scared by alot of games, most horror games tend to just stress me out but something like Alien: Isolation (Which I still haven't completed) show what true horror can be. This... kinda feels like it. I encountered a few bugs and there was a point where you had to break apart body parts, but the story telling point of view of this is really good and some of the scares are tense. The shower area was honestly horrible for me. But I can't give this 5 stars mainly because I found it... rather short. Not to mention that I only saw 3 of the main cast of puppets. The scientist and her dog, and Mortamer who you see at the beginning. But it alludes to seeing 2 more, the artist and the Pie baker... I just played though and I already forgot their names. I was sad that the game didn't end up longer on that end though. Perhaps I just got the quick sewer and out ending...","Dec 13, 2019 at 6:33 PM",4, 13,"Hey TheFoxO, glad you found the game interesting, and thanks for your well thought-out review.

A unique horror were you are the host for a creepy hand puppet, and it's done really well.
My only gripe is the annoying vignette that you can't remove.
Also I had to replay some of the area's as the door would not open when I completed the puzzles.
At one point I picked up a green pin to open a door and it flew out of my hands and I was unable to progress (as seen at the end of my video below).

2022-05-28 18:36:20.195397,wilson.long.739,Fun Challenging and Thrilling,"SPOILERS{READ AT YOUR OWN RISK}
Good part:
The concept is great, the story is intriuging and the humor is.... well, humorous(the humor is mostly scout insulting you but still) and in all, half of this $h!t scared , and or creeped me out, and I'm not easily scared. And maybe it's because I'm an emotional person{it probably is} but the ending made me cry.
My critiques:
The was a few parts where it would hint to you what to do such as the part with the rats in the vents, or retrieving the pin from the suspended corpse, but it takes a hot minute to figure it out if you're kinda dense like i am with picking up hints.It also was a little TOO easy to beat the final chase sequence, but hey I wasn't complaining in my head all I thought was "" The quicker we get out of this b!+c# the better, cause i dont want to meet Rosco face to face"" I also would have loved to have seen Daisy Danger or Nick Nack other than just posters, and hope that there's DLC planned for the future to where we have to deal with them. And I know this might come off as a nitpick, but I wish there was more dialouge and banter between characters.
In All:
I totally enjoyed ""Hello Puppets!"", it has everything I look for in a dark comedy good story , suspense, creepy visuals and puppets, because everybody loves puppets. While it ended pretty quick, and there are things I felt could be improved on I would still happily replay it as is, and would still recommend it to my friends, coworkers, and collegues who enjoy a nice chill down their spines.
