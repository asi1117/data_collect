2022-05-28 18:27:54.836541,Katostrofik,It's a bit more fun than it looks,"Decided to get this while it was on sale and it provides a bit of fun. As you can see in the video/previews you throw little bits of dynamite and things to cause explosions. There are little issues here and there but to me, it's worth $3. Maybe someday it will be worth the normal price of $15 but it would take a LOT of improvement to get anywhere close to that.","Dec 13, 2017 at 11:15 PM",4, 0,"Thank you for your review, these are our current feelings as well. We will try to finish the game this year and set a new price tag that is appropriate.

Thanks for giving us a chance :)"

It's very simple to play yet highly satisfying. Since it's in early access the developers still have stuff to add but with the amount of content currently availible it's already worth the price. Hopefully they'll add some co-op options or maybe let us design our own setups to destroy in a sandbox mode. This game is best played standing up with the motion controllers.,"Jun 25, 2017 at 8:04 AM",5, 3,

I love finding new concepts in VR and this is certainly one of the more entertaining finds. Blowing stuff up in VR feels like a natural progression. I had a blast with this game and can't wait to see what other episodes have in store.","May 30, 2017 at 1:20 AM",5, 7,
