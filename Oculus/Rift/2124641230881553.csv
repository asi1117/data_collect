2022-05-28 15:06:49.179741,Vox-Multis,"Short, but brilliantly executed","This was a great experience for the price.

The graphics are close enough to photorealistic that it's possible to forget you're in VR. The game makes good use of real photos and videos (on laptops, TV screens, projectors) to make you feel like you're in the real world, and even the in-game humans(?) you meet are fairly convincing.

Not a ton of interaction beyond opening doors and picking up items, but what's there is very intuitive and works as you'd expect it to work in reality, with an attention to detail you don't often get in video games, VR or otherwise.

It also incorporates a good deal of real-world folklore, which helps to make even the supernatural elements feel that much more real.

And yes, it is scary. The game expertly ramps up the suspense, and got two good screams out of me during the short playtime from beginning to end.",Jul 25 at 6:18 PM,5, 8,
2022-05-28 15:06:49.194701,JEANPAUL1605,The best VR terror experience,"If you are new in the VR world I do recommend you to buy this game since it is short but it has everything, you do have to interact with the enviroment for you to continue with the history. 
It is perfect for you to show it to someone who has never experienced VR terror games also it is amazing even for people like me who has tried other terror games, I simply loved it!
Keep it up with the good god guys, I'll be looking forward for chapter 2.","Jun 10, 2021 at 1:00 PM",5, 6,

But Kobold is exactly the perfect amount of horror for me. There was only one major jump scare .The rest is just giving you the creeps in a great looking and sounding atmosphere. I hope, there will be a 2nd part.","Jul 16, 2020 at 9:35 PM",5, 15,

We had about 20 people over and one person played it while the rest watched it being projected on our theater system with surround sound. After about an hour we reached the pinnacle of the story (and subsequently the end) and everyone was screaming-- it was certainly a memorable VR moment!

Conclusion: I hope they continue the story.

After commenting on what I thought of Episode 1 in which I didn't spend much time or pay attention to detail, the AnotherWorld team got in touch with me and we very kindly and cordially discussed various points in the game.

A great chapter, waiting for the second with great desire. They are working on it and with a lot of effort. It is a highly recommended purchase and is very enjoyable. The atmosphere is very well done and the experience at Kobold is equally rewarding and terrifying.

I played on the rift s. I had a small issue about half way through where one of my controllers started vibrating like crazy. I don't know if it was the game or just something random.

2022-05-28 15:06:58.765104,DogFoodFactory,Leaves You Wanting More,"I thought the game was great, playing on the Rift S. While the graphics are fine, it's more than made up for by the chilling atmosphere and interesting story. While navigating the mansion is spooky enough, feeling somewhat like a horror-themed escape room, the game ends just as it's getting good. Without spoiling much, the ending sequence felt very ""Blair Witch"" to me, which I loved. However, just after this sequence, the game ends (in a very startling way, I may add) and you're hit with the rolling credits. Interacting with the world is fairly intuitive, and there is plenty to interact with. Whether it's reading note, operating a VCR, slide projector, or locating keys and drawings symbols with chalk. The inventory system is easy to work with and pleasing to the eye, but I didn't find myself using it as much as I thought I would. 

All in all a great experience that might require a little over an hour of your time, but it will certainly be an exciting and interesting hour. Here's hoping for a second episode.","Dec 18, 2019 at 2:21 PM",4, 12,

old VHS videos, diapositives and old age audio cassettes to listen, together with the well acted voice that reads letters, create  a really great atmosphere.

I reinstalled 2 times .The third time i installed it on the SSD drive as it is recommened..I am playing with the Oculus Link BTW ....Also i dont think my PC is the problem . Coz it is a i7 9700 with an RTX 2060 6GB...and 16 RAM . I hope for an answer coz i want so badly to play and give the 5 stars it deserves ! Cheers from Greece      update...

Glad to hear you are trying out playing KOBOLD on the Quest via cable! Please remember that this still experimental until the official link cable is released. In the first room (before entering the green door) there is a menu on the wall where you can lower your graphics settings. Use the remote control on the table and point it at the menu where it says graphics normal and high settings. The game is set to high by default. Point the white circle cursor over the lower graphics setting and it will change. We recommend this setting for Oculus Quest via link cable."
2022-05-28 15:07:01.912685,RomperStomp,Jaw dropped.,My first experience with this: I was blown away by the realism. By the time the first scare hit me I was so deeply gone in the world that I forgot where I was completely. It took me about an hour and half to find the boy. The ending was a  good cliffhanger.  Loved the whole world and interacting with all the old stuff lying and I especially loved drawing with the chalk.  Graphics are next level. Atmosphere is spooky.  It felt very very real.

It causes a conflict between Steam VR controller bindings and Oculus inputs.There is a workaround if you delete the config file at this path: Windows (C:) Users \YourUsername\AppData\Local\Kobold_EA\Saved
If you delete this config file, or the entire saved folder your inputs should work again the next time you start the game. Don't worry, the config file will write itself anew when you start the game. The cause of this is an incompatibility between Steam VR and Oculus and we are working with them to fix it. If your problem persists, please write to support(at)anotherworldvr.com Don't be rude. We are here to help. Thanks."

you sit and try to do what seems natural, but you are left wondering ....WTF??  this is NOT VR!!  this is guess and what your contoller can NOT do.

gave 2 stars becuase i figure,  IF .... they figure out how to include rift-s controls, i could be a good experience.","Oct 23, 2019 at 12:51 PM",2, 2,"Hi. Rift S controls are supported. To interact with the menu pick up the remote on the table (it is blinking) using either your index trigger or grip button on your controller and then point the remote at the menu. A white cursor will appear. Hover the cursor over the menu item you would like to change and it will change. Your flashlight did not disappear, chances are you placed it in your bag at your hip. The bag is your inventory system. Look down and you should find the flashlight there. This is a standing experience. Chances are you are having issues because you are sitting down. If you are new to standing, room scale VR with interactive controllers that's OK. just reach out to us at support@anotherworldvr.com if you have any other problems. Thanks."
2022-05-28 15:07:05.036330,Barf_LoneStarr,Short but Scary,"Like many VR experiences, this was pretty short. It almost felt more like a demo, but there's definitely some meat to this story that I look forward to chewing on in forthcoming chapters. I wrapped up with this in just under an hour, but it was definitely an unsettling hour. I was scared for pretty much the entire time, and genuinely terrified at a couple of choice moments. Overall it was a fun, if not slightly underwhelming experience and I'm happy to have purchased it. Hopefully this was the first installment of many, because this is an excellent example of how horror games can offer you scares on a whole new level that flat games could never touch. I really enjoyed this. Keep up the great work, devs.","Oct 24, 2019 at 11:03 AM",5, 0,

I started to get really into it, collecting all I could and reading everything and all. But despite doing that, I was very negatively surprised when I reached the end after one hour of play.

Fortunately, I got it on sale so not really feel like I was scammed or anything. Don't take me wrong, that hour of gaming was awesome, and the ending was like the things I always feared too (so bonus point to manage to scare me, when I am known to be hard to scare).

Graphics are good except for some 2D picture implementation of objects. Story unfolds as you make your way through and discover details about the  missing. family.  This game took me about 30 minutes and I will play it again and take a few different paths. The tension builds and the end of the game is reminicent of the TV show Stranger things.  Looking foreward for chapter 2. Its a short game so get it on sale. I would not have paid full price for this game.  I am still on my quest to find the most terrifying game that will make me cry and scream and flail my arms as I run from the headset ripping the cord out of the PC. This one only has a couple jump scares but its a nice creepy story.  Short games have there advantage. You can watch others play through and you can accomplish in one play through and then go off to work to toil away and trade your precious life energy for little green pieces of paper which can then be exchanged for more VR games :)

First review, 

This is a really good game, but i think things can get better : 
- Controls are not intuitive, I think we could just have one button to grab
- (spoil alert) Is this a bug if you screwed up the drawing you can't do it again ? (end spoil)
- Some textures are just not done (like the dressing in the baby room)
- just remove the remote control in the setting room and let us click plz
- might get better and more meaningfull sounds (ambiant)

keep up the good work,

Amazing story = O That's the strong part of this game / experience.
It allows a small amount of interactivity, letting us explore in a detective way.

2022-05-28 15:07:33.483245,owenwp,Nonsensical Controls,"The controls are very awkward and inconsistent. When you pick up an object, it is stuck in your hand until you press the trigger with your index finger, and random buttons seem to cause you to do various things with them. When I picked up a remote control in the game, squeezing the grip caused the character to press a button on it with his thumb. The options menu is inside the game, and you are supposed to use said remote to operate it, but they don't tell you how and none of the buttons or seem to actually do anything meaningful. A fairly long winded tutorial tells you basically nothing beyond explaining what a joystick is and the backwards grabbing controls. 

Just let us pick up objects by holding the grip, and drop them by releasing it, like every other game. If you are going to require button presses to interact with things, either make them naturally match the physical buttons or add some UI showing what they do. The first minutes of the game are just frustrated fumbling because nothing works the way you expect.","Oct 31, 2018 at 12:10 PM",3, 3,

I hate the head bobbing feature they have (This should at least be defaulted off) Also hate the interaction with light switches and buttons (Should just be able to stick my finger out and push) But other than that its excellent for how short it is. The graphics are amazing to me, love the light sourcing and was terrified when playing. Love how the narrative plays out, and I do want more but I hate this short chapter method (Although understandable because of cost) This honestly makes me want to experience this type of mixed narrative game with a full pledge 2 hour movie (I would pay for that) I would pay 15 dollars for that and would return for more.","Oct 28, 2018 at 5:21 PM",5, 9,"Dear jay4405,

2022-05-28 15:07:36.612874,Metalsech,Stunning but no free turning,"Incredible visuals and very immersive. However disappointed by the lack of free turning. Why is this not an option in a brand new high quality experience like this? Real gamers want free turning, snap turning (with or without scrolling) is annoying. Please add this as soon as possible devs. Also didn't know how to change options until I read other reviews, this needs to be more direct by pointing your finger at them. I'm stuck at the room with the circle on the door, tried drawing on it with chalk but nothing happens, devs please can you drop me a hint? Cheers

Edit: Guys thanks so much for getting back to me, it's nice to see devs actually reading the reviews and responding so fast :) However turning on comfort rotation on the options doesn't enable free turning, it has the opposite effect by instantly snapping the view instead of scrolling it. What I mean by free rotation is no snap turning at all, so you rotate like you would do in any non-VR game. Please can you implement this as a third movement option? You'll make me and a whole bunch of other gamers very happy.","Oct 30, 2018 at 8:54 AM",4, 2,"Free turning has been added to the menu. The option is called ""smooth rotation"""

2022-05-28 15:07:36.645786,iamcode23,An Absolute Masterpiece!!,This is one of the most unique experience I have ever had in VR. It isnt your typical horror game and thats a good thing. From the very beginning you will find yourself thrown into a world that is beautifully crafted with great care and thoroughness. This isnt a game where you are just a spectator either. It is a game that requires you to think and it rewards the gamer for their efforts. I love how it forced me to really consider all the decisions that I needed to make. And honestly the level of detail that went into the writing and presentation of this game is something that is truly missing from a lot of VR games. I felt like a detective and the game allowed me to play like one. Every corner seems to be filled with new things to discover. The game mecahnics are top notch and as a VR developer I was blown away by how well the game mechanics have been implemented. There wasnt a moment where I felt lost and didnt know what to do. Everything is done so well and all of it feels natural and instictive. Plus it scared the crap out of me!! This is one of those games that you will not regret buying. It is a perfect blend of supernatural thriller and intellectual genius.,"Oct 29, 2018 at 7:04 AM",5, 5,Thanks!
