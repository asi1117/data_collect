2022-05-28 19:37:40.169556,Alicia_Wonderland,"Freezes computer, unusable","Got just past loading screen then saw a choice of 4 rooms and play all, but nothing I selected did anything and there was no way to quit and it froze my whole computer and had to do a hard restart. Windows 10, 1080ti.

Ugh, made the mistake of trying it again. This time I was able to use the app, watched the first short bathroom section, realized it was a standing app and I was already in bed, didn’t feel like getting up, quit the app and then my computer froze again and had to do a hard restart. There is definitely something wrong with this app that affects the whole OS of the computer. Looked interesting but short. I might try again when I’m ready to shut down my computer but don’t expect to be able to use your computer without a hard restart after using this.  Very glitchy.",Jan 22 at 6:24 AM,1, 0,
2022-05-28 19:37:40.184515,DelapierceD,Thankful for Experience Opportunity,Very helpful for developing understanding of why dementia can be so scary for the person experiencing it. Excellent use of VR and its capacity to experience another perspective,"Mar 9, 2021 at 6:19 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:37:40.200473,cybernettr,Barely touches on the pain of dementia,"As someone with two very dear family members who both suffered from dementia, I can attest to how horrible this condition can be, and this experience attempts to put the player in the dementia victim’s shoes. One thing it doesn’t touch on is the anxiety that the dementia sufferer can face. Perhaps it could add another experience in which the victim wakes up in the middle of the night in a dark room and only slowly starts to realize where they are, but once they do so, discovers that they are seemingly alone in an empty house.","Sep 26, 2020 at 2:04 PM",4, 3,Thank you for the feedback and suggestion - we are hoping to expand this tool to include more scenarios in the future and will certainly be looking at exploring anxiety in more depth.
2022-05-28 19:37:40.217428,DrKollar,It is a great and very useful software,"Thank you very much for the software. I teach medical students, and with the help of it, I was not just able to arouse their interest in elderly patients with dementia, but I also was able also to significantly change their attitudes towards elderly patients with dementia. I would like to summarize my experiences in a study, and the results will be presented  on an online conference in May (Eurasia Research online live conference for 6th ICTEL 2020, 11-12 May, 2020) in my keynote presentation.","Apr 24, 2020 at 3:04 AM",5, 4,"I watched your keynote, and found the results of your trial very compelling. It's fantastic that your medical students are finding it so useful."
2022-05-28 19:37:40.232387,Mizu1993,Interesting,"Interesting, but could have done a bit more. It doesn't give me the feeling of having Dementia, which would be interesting. It's only a very very small part of it.","Apr 17, 2020 at 1:41 AM",3, 0,Thank you for the feedback - we are hoping to expand this tool to include more scenarios in the future. Small indies like ourselves often have to work within restrictive budgets.
2022-05-28 19:37:43.326225,Lucky_Two,Excellent.,"This game kinda reminded me on why I work in the health service in the first place. It was painfull to watch at times. I'm not complaining, It just made me thing alot about life in General and family stuff. (Well done by the way!)

This is NOT the kind of ""game"" where you can expect to free-roam or get alot of story choices. You just got to experience it, really.

2022-05-28 19:37:43.342182,teaching.cambrian,App crashes immediately?,"Hi there, can you please help me troubleshoot. The app will launch, then immediately crash and kick me back to the oculus homescreen. I've uninstalled and reinstalled with no luck. My oculus rift is up to date re: drivers etc. I'd love to use this app so any assistance would be much appreciated!","May 24, 2019 at 2:22 AM",1, 1,"Hi. Sorry to hear that you are having difficulties. Can you tell me specifically which screen it crashes on? Do you see a 'Galactig' logo before the crash, does it get past this to the menu screen in the kitchen, or is it a crash before any logos appear? This may be related to a known false-warning issue by Norton security which blanket-quarantines any similar packages developed using Unity, as this is. If you have Norton (or similar) installed could you please check that it is not preventing the installation or running of the app. Thanks."
2022-05-28 19:37:43.357143,VirtuaLieven,A good start for a great experience,"First of all: This is not a game. Don't expect to walk around or get a great experience. But what you see is a perfect reflection of dementia. What I like most is the kitchen scene, which displays how dement people suddenly see things that are not there.
The basic idea of the app is really good, but it certainly needs improvement: more scenes or longer events. Maybe a voyage-like long experience. As it is now, you're done within ten minutes. But what you see is really great. I hope to see more like this one day. It's very interesting and also sad (My grandfather suffered dementia for many years, so I can compare very well.)","Apr 3, 2019 at 4:05 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:37:43.372102,Mach13-13,A Must See For All Families,"So... Despite the issues with previous verions, This one (V1.7) has the gllitches i'd expereinced previously (V1.4) resolved and is much improved. 

This is a clever use of VR to provide an insight into just how demetia deprives loved ones of their normal day to day life, how passed and present bleed into each other to exacerbate confusion and how family might become torn as they struggle to help and pre-empt things going wrong.  Its an innovative take and thought provoking piece of work which I hope will continue to develop.  The graphics are clean and well rendered.  Its short but cleverly done especially with the final episode.  I'm not quite sure how the live action daughter character kept my eye contact despite my moving around...

I sincerely hope there is more... 

This is resonsive dev with an important message so try it and feedback to them, as i'm guessing it could still be a work in progress and feedback appears to be invaluable to these guys.","Feb 26, 2019 at 10:30 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:37:43.387063,charlie8611,Need more of this sort of thing,"As you'd expect from something publicly funded, it is slightly low budget, and sometimes feels constrained by this.  On the other hand, it is a really worthy enterprise and manages to give you a good sense of what I imagine dementia is like - the sense of confusion.  I'd guess it would also be interesting to build on some of the narratives, e.g. what are the consequences when you don't choose the right pills?","Feb 9, 2019 at 7:42 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:37:46.462952,Sera_phim,Powerful stuff,"My grandmother had dementia and I was interested to see how something like this might work in VR. The dialogue really captures the frustration and confusion of living with this awful illness. 

This made me think about how we used to treat her - often talking about her as if she wasn't there. I wish we hadn't done that.","Feb 8, 2019 at 4:53 AM",5, 6,
