2022-05-28 19:19:41.759145,SAAM_i_AM,Hands Down Best WWII flight/tank/ship,"First and foremost, Disregard the 1 star reviews. To those who left 1 star saying the game just crashes, go to the developer website hitechcreations and download the game again. I'm a flight combat fanatic with 25 yrs playing Ace Combat, IL2, Warbirds ect.. I discovered Aces High III in 2017 when I got my Oculus Rift and was instantly addicted to the extent I play 4 hours a day and have been for the past 3 years.
Why is this game so epic for me? Simply put, 
1.)Game speed, 
2.) Near zero load time (literally 1 minute from click game start to in air flying).
3.) Level of competition, As you may or may not know, Aces High launched in 1999 and added VR support in 2016. What you have after 20 years is a community of die hards that plays at a skill level Epic 10x. Better bring your A game to compete with this community. Three years later and I can now hold my own.
4.) The sheer number of Planes, Vehicles, Boats you can use in this game. Essentially every fighter, heavy fighter, bomber, Tank, mobile anti aircraft, ships guns from every major country in WWII is in this game and playable!!
5.) and the main reason for my 4 hrs a day in this game. Touch Controller integration in Aces High is without a doubt best in industry. So good it should be the industry standard for touch controller flying. As I've said, I have been a flight sim player for 25 yrs and Love my HOTAS. Aces High has made me put my HOTAS in the closet. It's a little akward at first, but with proper button mapping and just a little bit of practice, it becomes so second nature that your brain forgets you are holding a touch controller and not the actual flight stick in the cockpit. I swear I even feel resistive feedback.
6.) The incredible flight modeling. Dale Addink, the Game owner/developer is also a pilot and the flight modeling is so good that real pilots call it best in sims. You can very distinctly feel and experience the differences in all the planes in terms of climb rate, roll rate, dive etc etc.. FLY",Jan 27 at 10:17 PM,5, 11,
2022-05-28 19:19:41.774105,Breadsticat19265,Absolute Blast If You Have a Brain,"When I first found this game, I was instantly interested. A World War Two flight simulator? That works with Oculus Rift AND touch controllers? AND it has tanks? Incredible!

I did read some reviews of the game prior to dowloading it, and I saw that the game didn't have a very good reception on the Oculus Store. I figured that I didn't have anything to loose by trying it, however, so I downloaded it with low expectations. And man, am I glad that I did.

When I loaded into a game and selected a plane from the hangar, I was blown away. I was sitting in the actual cockpit of a Spitfire Mk I, a plane I had only previously flown in Il2 Cliffs of Dover. Although there were a few innacuracies (which I expected) the cockpit was actually modelled very well. All of the gauges and switches were (technically) functional, and it looked great. 

Gamplay was also very fun, with an in-depth flightmodel and damage model. The game's dynamic has you capturing enemy territory, fighting to destroy and then takeover enemy airfields and towns. And although I was a bit confused on what to do at first (other than shoot at enemy planes) I found the community to be quite helpful and friendly. I had a blast.

Tank gameplay wasn't quite as fun, since tank interiors aren't modelled and there isn't multicrew (come to think of it, there isn't multicrew anywhere in this game to my knowledge) but I still had a lot of fun trying to capture a nearby town in my M8 Greyhound.

I was left feeling pleasant surprised, but also confused. Why did the VR community have such a negative opinion of this game? Sure, the game has a few rough edges since it's literally a VR port of a 20+ year old game, but I still had a total blast and I've found myself playing it more and more. I was able to easily load in to the game (after a little wait to allow some ""skins"" to download, which happened literally one time), select a plane, and go shoot at bad guys.

I may never know. But I know one thing. This game is fun.",Jan 23 at 7:14 AM,5, 7,

A couple of days ago, i thought, try again, an spent a few hours, very slowly, getting it together, and ill be honest, im very impressed, ive only taken spit mk IX up, fully mapped out, with no helpers on, and wow, realy impressed, not tried combat yet, but flight modle was in range of DCS, and IL 2, graphic wise, falls beetween the two, i.e. for my pc , which is just above mid range for vr. So to anyone thinking about this game, try it, and just take your time just mapping, you will be rewarded :),  btw i tried touch controlers for full flight, but missed the feel of ff on stick, and missed my other hands on controls lol,  ill give another review after iv been dogfighting,lol.","Jan 13, 2019 at 3:17 AM",4, 5,

The concept is awesome.  But the GUI is so buggy as to be virtually unusable.  Whever I finally got in a plane, the controls were a little awkward but I managed to get the planes in the air.  VR is awesome for flight sims because you can turn your head.  Never could land any of these right.  Never.  And I've got a few hundred hours of real flight time, including tail draggers.

You strap on a WWII aircraft with accurate flight models and do combat with other players. You can dog fight, bomb, and attack ground targets. 
I will be honest, this is not an arcade game. This is a real combat sim, it takes time to learn. If you have any questions you can ask other players, most are willing to render assistance. Once you invest 10 hours in it I guarentee you will be hooked and will be spending many more hours with this game. It is subscription based, but it is the best $15 you ever spent.
I will admit that I havent had the time to learn the touch controls and have stuck with my stick and keyboard commands. 
The graphics are great, but to be honest that is not the focus of the game.

I understand its been around for quite some time (+ 15 years actually), and ive never heard of it, neither played it, although i am deep into flight sims! 

The controls at first sight seemed to be ""dull"" and ""arcade"", but i changed my opinion when this ""dull and arcade"" like control system completely removed the need for intrument and avionics multitasking, which works incredibly well in VR.

You got your two hands in the cockpit, there to grab the yoke and throttle controls. Thats the only things you can interact with in the cockpit, which to my suprise works really well. 

The motion controllers has a few mapped keys to them, like throttle up\down, for when you cant be bothered to reach out and grab them. You also got flaps, up\down, gears, main\secondary weaponchange, and the VOIP control, which utilize the thumb proximity\touch sensor as the InRange VOIP control, to transmit your voice to other aircraft in the immediate vicinity of yourself. Ive never seen any other game that uses the proximity\touch control, so this adds two new buttons to the controls, and it works beautifully well.
You also got the map key, bail out, and other smaller keymappings to them. 

Dogfighting is hard, very hard, since you grab the yoke with your controller, with no place to pivot it, like a traditional yoke, you'll find yourself pulling the stick over all places making you stall and\or shot down, however this is a thing you'll get to know better and then know to move the stick in incriments, and not wiggle it all over the place.

MP is absolutely awesome! Nuff' said!

You got aircraft, vehicles and a boat to choose from. All vehicles from American, British, Finnish, German, Italian, Japanese and Russian models, from the simplest British Spitfire, US P-51, German FW 190, Finnish Brewster, Italian C-202, Japanese A6M2 and Russian Yak-series, +bombers.

2022-05-28 19:20:10.168161,gpcustom,Dumbing down of a once great game,"In its day when I first subscribed over ten years ago this game was an authentic combat simulator with hundreds of players interacting together in ground and ariel combat. It had such a following that some times during peaks play you could not enter an arena because it was full. It had everything going for it. Stuff to blow up.Combat that challenged you!! Then something happened and the developers must have decided that it was to hard, too authentic. or complex for the average player and it was reduced over the past 6 years to anything but authenic in nature, lossing most of its player base in the process. If participation trophies are your gig then this game will all but help you out with dusting them off and finding a nice shelf for them. I mean they literally have introduced a radar bar so you know when there is a ground vehicle(Just like in WWII?) . They all but put a big arrow over it telling you where to go. 
Otherwise its just not as impressive in this new simplified format  as Elite Dangerous, War Thunder or many others on the market where they have stayed with a winning combination that has kept original player base hooked. This game had an emense player following being a subscription game and they have reduced the original base of enthusiasts to a mere handful of players.  Graphics are okay in VR. Some aircraft are drop dead knock outs inside the cockpit but scale is also off giving it a toy pedal car  vibe.","Aug 13, 2018 at 6:11 AM",1, 6,

2022-05-28 19:20:10.215036,Sabrejet,This review before you decide Good Game!,"Okay, when I first got this game, I ripped it as the worst broken game ever.  The menu didn't work, and I couldn't get into the game. I thought it was just a broken forgotten game.   Well I have come to a complete 180! I guess they fixed the menus, and the game is NOT bad at all, especially for an arena dogfight multiplayer game saving on FPS.
The graphics are a bit low-poly, the textures are nice, but what I have to say it's all extremely homogenous.  It all looks good together, with some surprises.
I can't speak about multiplayer details or game mechanics so far, but as far as a VR Flight Sim, it's fantastic.   You can fly every kind of plane you can think of, plus tanks, vehicles and ships.  The B17 felt very realistic.  It's not DCS World, but it also leaves some things out that DCS World should leave out.

I hope people haven't panned this too badly and others discover this game, it's cult classic worthy, and would be great to see a strong community get behind it.

Pros:
-Very nice solid graphics that all work together.
-Controls are fair, can use a controller instead.
-Using Touch to control your plane gives a good challenge
-HUGE amount of vehicles to control
-Extremely good framerate
-Easy to play, hard to master
Cons:
-none graphic wise unless you are a stickler for absolutely top of the line in all your games.
-Touch controls are a little tough, but not as bad as other games, your hands don't fall off the controls.

I really think this is an overlooked sleeper.  I hope a community forms for this.","Jul 11, 2018 at 7:51 PM",5, 7,

The texture quality was average yet it dropped my framerate massively and so was still unplayable(even when I lowered the quality to the minimum). I am not sure if this applies to others as well , but it does to me.  What I did not like was that the major servers they had, I would have to pay monthy. If you are looking to gain some revenue off this game(or project), then   don't make the game free. Another problem(im not sure if I am accidentally clicking something on the controller )is when my position in game and view begins to change. Its hard to explain but heres the best way I can, in the menu(this is a example) when I move my head left and right, the menu screen begins to get closer to me, or when on the plane,my position on it constantly changes so that either I move away from the seat, or it changes so i am in front of the in game menu(Sorry if it is confusing, just ignore it if you dont understand).The controls were very complex, but I (sort of) managed. What I liked most was that you could control the plane as though you were literally flying it, increasing the immersion. In the end, I still think it is a good idea, but does need improvement. Out of all this, I think I am most concerned of is the monthly payments to play on popular servers. I think this should be put in a beta state until it meets the wants of the customers.","Apr 16, 2018 at 3:20 AM",3, 2,"I'm confused about this "" Another problem is when I look around, the HMD begins to change position or zoom into places I look.

Once you get used to having to use mouse to initially assign your controller axes/buttons etc then it gets a bit easier.

2022-05-28 19:20:16.468310,nightcat.mau,Great Fun!,"I had fun. The last time I flew a combat plane was Top Gun on the NES, so this was plenty different, yet about the same. However, it is clearly meant for the right set up, my game pad wasn’t cutting it. The plane was slow to respond to commands, and my eventual lift off after repeated crashes was a miracle. Which ended in ten seconds because I decided to swing around to buzz the airfield and the plane refused to climb out of an abrupt nose dive. 

If you’ve got the right set up it’s apparently great fun. But with a game pad, best of luck. Also, if you can't be fussed about wing flaps and learning to fly a virtual plane with no help, I’m guessing the game isn’t meant for you. The videos are rubbish unless you already play flight sims because the game pad got almost no response out of the controls, though the guns and throttle worked just fine. Also, the laugh in the narrarator’s voice wasn’t exactly inspiring, it’s like the devs wanted people to wash out. 

The community seems mostly nice though, and I was able to at least take off thanks to the advice in some of the reviews. I wish there had been dog fights offline where you could at least find some action but although the map was supposed to take me to one I never got there. I’m assuming because I crashed so many planes. So, if you are intensely into flight and war sims you will likely love it. But if you aren’t the learning curve is steep but doable. Best of luck!","Mar 25, 2018 at 5:13 AM",5, 0,

The Rift really comes alive in an online WW2 combat flight simulation. With no radar and no missiles, armed only with your machine guns and fighter pilot skills, the pilot with the best set of eyes has the upper hand. ""Lose sight, lose the fight"". In the wild mayhem of a massive multiplayer dogfight arena with hundreds of planes, all piloted by human players, the Rift will give you the upper hand in tracking multiple enemies and maintaining situational awareness. You get to experience WW2 air combat like you've never experienced it before.
