2022-05-28 20:38:47.931824,JonnyJamesC,,"Second time of buying the game at a absolute bargain price because the first time I refunded as I had the crash when moving my hand up to the lever. 

Having loved the demo I am so glad the game is now fixed and it is so enjoyable. Real proper hands-on Touch controllers game. Great controls, a catchy moody soundtrack that reminds me of sci fi films from the 80s and 90s. 

The graphics are really great and the scale of environments immense. The game runs fantastically. Very very good so far and it is supposed to be a full length title. Hoping I will have to change my rating to 5 Stars by the end.","Aug 20, 2020 at 3:00 PM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 20:38:47.962741,ssamayoa,I'm about to ask for refund!,"I brougth this game because I tried the ""Preface"" and liked but for me is UNPLAYABLE!
When I'm about to disable the FIRST BARRIER in the whole game I just raise my hand the game crashes!
I thought ""it might be causal"" and tried again (and again) with same result.
FWIW my setup (not new but decent):
I5 7500 + 32G RAM 2400 + SSD EVO 980 + GTX 1080 11G + ASUS 270 Pro
Oculus Rift with 3 sensors
BTW ZERO stars should be available!","May 14, 2020 at 2:39 AM",1, 10,The problem is finally resolved. We apologize to you. Have a nice game!

2022-05-28 20:38:51.109325,Masamune5454,"low price, buy it","so i was very surprised after playing boiling steel preface, that this full game is much deeper and more complex. there are more weapons, and the upgrades are enough to keep me striving for more (stormland was great, but endgame lacked upgrades) 
now theres some issues here, and judging by the game i think these are bad design choices instead of lack of dev ability.
ill start by saying, the cutting of locks and charging of batterys was cool, but intergrated poorly into the game. you should have had a weapon mode and tool mode for each weapon. therefore, you could switch between them to allow for side activitys,  the game feel more fleshed out. i get there are multiple weapons and you can only take two, but theres many ways around this. for one you could just inlcude multiple paths that depend on the weapons you take,. im not a fan of no inventory here, becuase it would have been best to just be able to swap your setups at any time. being locked into it when doing a mission feels limiting.

that said i do like the game, i just feel there are some clear misses, and im sure its mostly the fact of new to vr and feeling it out. i think thier next game if they make one will be much better.
i do want to point out, things are confusing at times, like the upgrade tree.

the biggest issue however, lies deep in the games roots. lack of interactivity. i get this isnt lone echo, but grips should grab and trigger should work as index fingy. the weapon system would be cool, but just having a fancy way of bringing the weapon out doesnt change the fact that its stuck to your hands or has no interaction. it would have been amazing if i could just take my hand off the front of the gun lol. and have a reload system like slapping in power cells or putting nail clips into the gun. agian for the price i think i paid 4 bucks, for that price its well worth it, i mean the story is actually intriuging and feels like you really are in trouble.
so sale = get if interested","Aug 27, 2020 at 5:00 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 20:38:51.125283,taquitobuddy,Competent shooter outshined by others,"This is a competent but forgettable VR shooter.   I played a few hours and the game was polished but bland.  It has good options menu, was bug free, some light progression elements, and responsive combat/movement.  However, I can't really imagine recommending this game to anyone over many other better/more interesting VR shooters.  The weapons were fun to use, the missions were repetitive with no interesting boss fights, and I'd have preferred to be able to upgrade/customize a single frame rather than just the random ones you pick each mission.  So again, not a bad game by any means and it was clearly made by a competent programmer, but unfortunately it is outshined by other similar offerings.","Feb 21, 2020 at 3:44 PM",2, 19,We are very sorry.

My Initial Thoughts:
I had the pleasure to try this game in early beta back in May 2019 and way back then I knew it was something special.
The game has come along leaps and bounds and is a stella entry into the VR action adventure market!
A must for any sci-fi adventure fan.","Feb 14, 2020 at 2:48 AM",4, 15,
