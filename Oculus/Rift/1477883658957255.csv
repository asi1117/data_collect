I only knock it down a star, because I fear it's going to be abandoned, and VR coaster games are criminally underutilized. Please, devs, keep new tracks coming, and just throwing it out there, but licensing stuff from Disney and Universal would be amazing.",20 days ago,4, 3,

----
This was my first purchase for quest 2 about 10 months ago.  I really loved it and enjoyed to envonments.  But because the game was so large with all the levels, I placed it on my PC and link it through there to my Quest.  I'm sure that I've played it serveral times in spring and early summer, but now when I go to try is I see the B4T splash screen then the game quits.  Looking at the other reviews I must not be the only one.  I'm in the process of doing a fresh game install on the PC to see if that works.  All my video drivers are up-to-date.
PLEASE FIX.  I want to experience these coasters again.

I left a note for you devs at Steam - do I really have to pay for the DLCs all over again just because I changed headsets?  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARGH!!  You ruined the medieval coaster!  What were you thinking??  Bring back the archers shooting arrows into the cart and the fire breathing dragon at the end.
-----------------------------------------------------

I've had the free version of this since Nov 2019 or thereabouts.  Has always worked perfectly.  I agree with some in that the graphics could use a little tweaking but one has to remember, there is a lot of motion and movement occuring here - there is always some trade-off with even the best of video cards I think.  

Having said that, I will probably get the full version.  The price is reasonable and all my guests enjoy the heck out of the wild rides!

UPDATE:  Purchased the full version and it is worth every cent!  Great entertainment for $13 USD and everyone that comes over to play on the Rift has to do at least a couple of the Epic coasters.  I particularly like the medievel ride but they are all good.",Sep 27 at 5:46 AM,3, 3,

The coaster physics can still use a lot of improvement (turns are still nauseating), and I hate the idea of a coaster that detaches from its track and lands hundreds of feet away. 

What I do like now, are the improved themes and many more tracks to ride, shoot or race through. The developers have kept up with improvements, and you can see it in some of the older tracks, like the Jurassic-style coaster which is a great show off piece when friends or family are over. Plus, they've added new features like a helmet which blocks some of the surrounding area to resuce VR sickness.  With 18 tracks, there's a lot to ride and the experiences are lengthy. Some themes are meh, while others are pretty impressive! I'm back on board, and hoping the developers continue to add more track and ideas to this wild experience.","Nov 11, 2020 at 1:09 PM",4, 6,

When I wanted to play something else, I had to remove my headset walk over to my computer, right click on the program's icon on my task bar and close it. I couldn't exit it with the controllers, neither the Oculus button nor the menu button would work while inside the game and removing my headset waiting a few minutes and putting it back on only placed me back at the game start menu.

I dialogued with both devs and Oculus Support back and forth, and now the app is shown as cross-buy on both Rift and Quest stores... but my In-app Purchases on Quest are still unavailable on Rift, and no reply yet from Oculus Support or B4T Games team.




** Original comments (reply to devs edited) **
Well executed for what it is, but the fact that add-ons purchased on Quest aren't unlocked on Rift (et vice et versa?) is honeslty a bummer, even considered that the basic package is free...
I would have preferred to pay the full set a higher fee, but have it available on both platforms rather than having to pay twice for the very same contents (regardless of the technical downgrade/upgrade aspect linked to the hardware).

Edit in response to dev reply 2020/06/02:
Well, I am logged from the start with the very same credentials on both devices.
I only have one single account for Rift and Quest, precisely to benefit of cross-buy when any available.
But as said, all purchases on Quest are still not unlocked in the Rift version.
And actually, I just noticed that the app itself isn't cross-buy for some reason... which explains why.

And playing with Oculus Link won’t help a bit, because it relies on PC Rift account, which hasn’t the tracks unlocked, you know?","Jun 7, 2020 at 1:59 PM",3, 10,"Hey there, all the DLCs are automatically cross buyed between Quest and Rift, even that on Rift is a totally rework on graphics.

2022-05-28 16:36:42.072250,OriginGoober,Intro to VR Motion Sickness = Perfect,"Starting off, I bought Skyrim VR and 'powered through' VR sickness to become used to it... I wish I had known about this game, honestly. I host many family and friend get togethers/parties and, as you may imagine, Oculus Rift (hosted on Corsiar One 2019) is a pretty big hit. I found this game earlier last night and ran through it and realized what an absolute gold mine it is for VR introduction. It is listed as Intense, but it's really moderate to strong. I ran some of my more 'motion sickness' prone siblings/nieces+nephews through this, then intro'd them to a dungeon crawl Save in Skyrim, and they were (mostly) perfectly adjusted with VR sickness. 

I purchased this game's extra rides for $12.99 at an advertised 46% discount... this is 100% worth the purchase. Have your friends/family try these rides first, *leaning into the curves/twists*, and they will be far more likely able to handle any more intense VR motion sickness game, from Rift Skyrim VR to Steam/PSVR Resident Evil 2.

100% serious. No benefits earned from this review or provided beforehand as prior compensation.

Edit (to the Devs): Completely forgot to review the game itself, apologies! I've seen some reviews compaining that the 'jerkiness' of the roller coasters are unrealistic, that there aren't enough build up/escalation times to the peak of the coaster arcs, and other such nonsense. I've never ridden a single perfectly smooth roller coaster ride in my life, and I worked at 2 different Six Flags and various other theme parks. There are one or two jerks per ride, but for the most part, they're fairly relative to the abrupt movements of real roller coasters. The only major flaw I 'felt' where the jumps between broken tracks... that provided a sense of dissonance for me since there are clearly not such track breaks in real life.

Meaning:
- The tracks are loooong (>5min per experience), obviously they are not real life rollercoasters but that doesn't matter, they are superlong and that makes it cool.
- The environments are awesome, and each is very different. From dinosaurs to a futuristic environment that makes you feel part of a SF novel.
- The one pack to unlock the other tracks all at once is advisable. Each track delivers a unique experience, environment and feeling.

However, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed these ones. After trying the two free rides I decided to buy the full pack. Some are better (& longer) than others but they are all great fun & a little scary in places :)

Upon loading I saw about 7 scenarios and a variety of carriages to choose from, and I thought it was amazing until I realised 5 of the scenarios and nearly all carriages are behind a pay wall. Even worse, it doesn’t tell you the price of each scenario until you click ‘buy’, and then you have to back out of the sale. Each scenario costs about AU$5, and based on the freebies they aren’t worth it.

The free scenarios are nice but simple .. not quite enough gut-wrenching moments for me, but I play VR flight sims so I’m used to rolling around all over the place.

There is nothing cute about that coaster and I was actually cowering in my seat. We finally have a true dark ride for the Rift! Oh, that coaster is in no way meant for the tiny ones, clearly teen and up, but it’s nice to have more mature content in the options. 

All of the previous coasters also got major overhauls, so each coaster is definitely getting better with each pass through. You’ve got eight coasters to choose from and I couldn’t be happier with this pack. 


UPDATE: This coaster pack just got a massive update. With a free new ride, updates to all four coasters reviewed below, and a new coaster to purchase it's simply the best coaster pack out there. 


The First two Rock Fall and Armageddon have gotten many updates and look spectacular. Rock falls improved the rock falls and every other aspect. So I also bought the rest and Armageddon obviously improved with all the love and care, the zombie scene is fantastic! 
The other two coasters are still sadly lacking. No updates and it shows.  Halloween is good spooky fun with a lot of nice animations, but it seems to lack the finishing polish of the first two rides, though it is great to see all the skeletons and the animated surprises. Snow Land just seemed flat overall, even though it has great potential, it lacked the animations that make the other rides enjoyable and needs some love. That said, this has to be the best coaster pack I’ve tried outside of Coaster VR.

The graphics are fairly solid.  The audio is great.  The different themed coasters are creative and different.  Some constructive criticism follows.  Many of the animations are a little weak.  For example the dragon's tail in the medieval coaster moved like a inflexible ""stick""), the T-Rex dinosaur's feet sometimes step into the ground.  Also, for some reason I always need to re-set my position using the Oculus controls because, by default, I'm usually placed inside the roller coaster car where my head is a little above the wheels, etc.  It's not perfect, but it's still the best VR coaster so far, and I hope the developer continues to polish the experience.","Jun 17, 2018 at 5:44 AM",4, 6,

Sound effects are kind of weird for me, they seem too quiet at times (such as when rocks fall or dinosaur stomps). Otherwise, everything else is great. Probably not going to buy the other tracks right now, but adding another interactive concept (guns - overdone but would be cool with these graphics and smoothness or having items that you can throw or do other stuff with) into this game would make it worth paying for.","Jun 10, 2018 at 5:57 AM",5, 2,

If you arent planning on paying some extra money for this game then I think you shouldn't really bother downloading it.

The metallic scraping sound effect is a nice touch but it needs some improvement and variety (fade in/out, have more than one sound, etc.) The map I tried I think is the default free one which has boulders falling down.

Lots of efforts went into this, but this is 2017, and honestly the roller coaster simulation was interesting 5 years ago, when it was a novelty, but at this time; we have full games that offer more than a RC ride, so unless you are Disney or Universal, and are making a free ride viewer to attract people to your park, there is not really much incentive to spend money for something that you watch once, and then it is purely for show to your friends that never saw VR experiences before.

The app is well done, and devs did a great job, hence the 3 stars, but beyond that, this product offer virtually nothing more than a brief experience; which I am not sure anyone would even plan to spend money on it.

But the textures and lighting are pretty good, and the track looks nice with the wheels on the coaster exposed.  The hill climbs were sometimes painfully long and I didn't feel like the coaster ever kept up its speed for long enough to get truly immersed before it climbed another hill.

As for the DLC, I did not buy any, but I think it would do the company a lot of good to list ""1 track free, 3.99 per additional track"" and mention there are 4 tracks total, 3 being pay.  3.99 is a fair enough price, though I think you could also do a 9.99 deal for all 3 and get way more takers.

In a future will be other ways and also other features, maybe your hands by Oculus touches and other controllers. Thank you so much for the feedback."
2022-05-28 16:38:04.441940,MarkT46,Good graphics!,"Great graphics! A very good simulation of a roller coaster ride! In reality, I would never go on a real one. This gives me a chance to experience what it could be like. Even so, I would like to see more of this, with a reality feel of being at a theme park! At the moment the ride is through steep rocks of the wild west with raised tracks. I wouldn't know what I would be buying if I knew my Oculus code. I'd prefer a full whack simulator based on real roller coasters!","Jan 3, 2018 at 8:26 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 16:38:04.477844,Shevzinho,It's good but ..,"You really feel the immersion in this one but you only get one track, the other 2 you have to pay, almost the price of a full game for a 1/2m ride. Makes no sense","Jan 13, 2018 at 7:49 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 16:38:04.494799,theoldones64,Thank You For Free Demo,"I am always appreciative of the hard work the many devs out there do. Also appreciate a free demo. Thanks!
I found the demo ride was enjoyable, but lacked any real gut wrenching excitement. The end of the ride is a neat idea! Extra rides a bit pricey. Coaster is a nice alternative. No Limits 2 is the ultimate. IMO","Dec 29, 2017 at 4:56 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 16:38:04.512751,serojay,It's just OK,"Bought both of the extra rides though i don't feel like the price is justified for what you get. I enjoyed the Halloween one the most but other than a few skeletons and pumpkins, there wasn't much to see. Would have been good to go through a haunted house or something. The snow one was the worst of the bunch though as the scenery is bland and boring. Hopefully future coasters are better but this will at least be fun when family come over on xmas day to try VR for the first time.","Dec 23, 2017 at 6:20 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 16:38:07.618444,ENFORCER1983,Amazing experience for the whole family!,"This roller coaster experience is by far the best on the rift store.  I agree with others that distant objects lack detail, but considering it's in it's infancy and is a free demo, I can't complain.  The head tracking is spot on and the details up close make for excellent imersion.  I never got motion sickness, so please make some more looptie loops :)  I feel the price for the additional rides are a bit overpriced, so I'll wait it out and hope to catch them on sale.  I'm looking forward to future updates from this title, and can't wait to see what they release.  My 6 year old plays the demo over and over and over.","Dec 25, 2017 at 4:57 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 16:38:07.637394,tonyfromsyracuse,the free coaster is ok,"I can only speak of the free coaster I might give the halloween looking one a whirl. but the problem I had with the free ride is, the slowdowns on the track are a total groove killer.
plus the scenery is sparse and the colors muted and drab.I would prefer the busy fairground with trees and sunshine and people milling around like you see in rollercoaster tycoon. I know,its free but rollercoaster rides are made for VR and so far no ones nailed it yet because they are trying to fly before VR is ready to walk or they totally miss the mark. someday someone will come up with a great VR rollercoaster game. until then, this is a fairly enjoyable ride.","Dec 30, 2017 at 5:48 AM",3, 0,Have you tried Armageddon ride?
