-1 primary enemy
-enemy has 1 real fighting tactic
-little jumscares
-decent atmosphere
-cant beat game without 1 specific item that is optional (should be a required item)
-mechanics are sluggish but usable.
-not much content besides 3 creepy encounters, 1 enemy, and very few places to visit. (about 6 excluding customer houses which serve little purpose. The 6 are including 3 places youll visit once for the story)

Now personal opinion
Did i find the game fun? yes and no. It was fun to do int he beginning and get a few scares but overall it just became repetative and unfun. Once you realize the primary enemy is literally the only enemy wholl attack you (and theres no way to fight back or run) it just becomes repetative.
Is there anything id suggest to the developer? Honestly yes, the game has potential, it has the atmosphere and story to be something more. It was enjoyable enough for a 5 dollar game, however if i could physically interact with the wheel with my hands, and like different things in the vehicle, like say adjust the radio and my mirror and what not. Maybe even be able to exit the car and enter some of the places like the pawn shop and gas station would be awesome, Add a little more of a scary factor as i dont wanna exit the safety of the car. I feel as though if you really put your mind to it. this game could be a game id pay 10 dollars or more for","Dec 2, 2020 at 10:06 PM",3, 18,"The reason the game is $4.99 is that it's made for quick entertainment.  We'd like to incorporate more features in a future release, but it all depends if the game sells or not.  Thanks for playing!"
