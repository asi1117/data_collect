This is basically just your xbox console games streamed to a virtual 2D screen. The resolution and screen size aren't terribly great, and the oculus controllers will not work with your games (you'll need an xbox controller and  dongle/receiver for your PC).

So in effect you have two GPUs working together. The VR image is rock solid and the graphics quality on the screen is much better than what you get with Big Screen and similar apps. You can play movies on your XBOX, or Youtube, and stream to the Rift as well. If you are lucky enough to have both a Rift and an XBOX One in your house then get this app!

Just to be clear, I had to install/uninstall it 3 times for it to work. Hope that helps everyone.

I played battlefield 4 on it, but it was hard to see my minimap and read text, but reading small stuff is hard to do anyways with oculus. The app is probably awesome for games that aren't too complex.

2022-05-28 17:34:59.683423,J_Red_64,Microsoft is on point!,"As the app explained, this allows you to play your xbox one on the Oculus Rift. You're in an environment that allows you to adjust the curvature, distance, and size of the screen. You have 3 different environments to choose from. Microsoft has also allowed us to adjust the volume of the environment, if you want to immerse yourself in the game sound only. I highly recommend it. My personal favorite was the Dome, as it was somewhat dark, allowing me to focus on the gameplay. I tested the streaming on medium, while playing Halo... almost felt like I was MasterChief himself, as I adjusted the screen to cover nearly the entire Rift screen with curvature. (As most of us know that Halo is a FPS with the view being from Chief's helmet.) This game requires a good stable internet connection for the best experience, otherwise you'll have stutters and lag as well. Most reviews I've read so far are giving the app below 4 stars, but honestly... there should be no reason that anyone would review this anything below 4 stars. Most games recommend a GTX 970 or Radeon 290, I recommend nothing less than an RX 480 or GTX 1060 for any VR game to enjoy a smoother experience on all apps.

My only recommendation would be to include a Void environment, as a few others recommended as well in their reviews. This is something I'm sure plenty of people would be on board with.","May 18, 2017 at 8:27 AM",5, 7,

2022-05-28 17:35:02.900817,Malific,As Advertised,"Does exactly what it says it does. Streams the 2D display of your Xbox One to a screen inside a virtual enviroment in your Oculus.

If you think it does more than that you need to read the description again.

Basically this app is good to use if you can't access your TV for gaming because other people are using it, or if you want to experience Xbox One on a larger screen than you own. If neither of those matter, the standard eyestrain caused by the Oculus makes this app not really worth using.

The distance, vertical position, and curvature of the screen can be adjusted, nothing else. Dome was my preferred enviroment simply because of how open it is and I was able to position my screen so that it filled almost the entire Oculus display, combined with the curvature this can simulate VR gameplay with an FPS... as long as you don't actually turn your head.

I didn't encounter any Install issues, but it does freeze the install if you remove the headset, just like Oculus freezes all it's games when the headset comes off. Though it does continue to stream when the headset is removed once things are up and running.

I took the headset off and let it idle for about 45 minutes after it was running and when I came back it would only give me a black screen. I had to close and restart the app, a common issue with streaming technologies when they idle out.

My network is all hardwired and capable of 100 MB/s (averaging around 10-20MB/s). I experienced no lag or latency issues with the display or controller during my test play (I played Overwatch for 10-20 minutes) and was even streaming an HD movie through my network with Vudu for my son while I was playing.

I had slight blurring during fast in game movements, which is also typical of streaming gameplay. Aside from that nothing was visually wrong aside from the standard eyestrain you get playing anything in VR.

All in all.. It's exactly as advertised.","Jan 9, 2017 at 3:46 AM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 17:35:06.056378,rainabba,Why? BigScreen does SO much better.,"There are only 3 environments. Of those, 2 are fundamentally flawed for this purpose because the screen sits above me and can't be curved enough or in the right direction. The one environment that's decent, has a freakin hand-rail in my view. Ironically, that environment is the only 1 of the 3 where I could find the controls and because I chanced on them there, I realized that if I basically lay on the floor in the other 2, I could find them.

The virtual screen control is seriously lacking and flawed. It's above me in 3 of the environments (contrained by the environment floor) and cannot be curved in the vertial or enough in the horizonal. You also have no size control (convergence), only distance and limited height.

Move the virtual camera (users position) up in all 3 environments, allow more curve in the horizontal, add distance/convergence, and some curve on the vertical, then cause the controls to come up (occulding the environment, if not closer to the user) when the user looks down, and this could be usable.

In the meantime, BigScreen is free, multi-player and even they most simple [lack of] environment; the void, is more usable. Why would I bother with this?

MS, I happen to know a UX designer you previously employed, how could have done FAR better and could fix this up in a hurry if you'd like a referral. Of course, I'd be happy to help too :)","Dec 14, 2016 at 11:39 AM",2, 3,
