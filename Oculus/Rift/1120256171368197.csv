2022-05-28 17:31:47.373266,McAND74,why only 5 models 3d ?,from site with Chrome browser is possible to examine all models  with oculus and move free .here is not possible -...,Jan 2 at 11:49 PM,4, 0,
2022-05-28 17:31:47.388226,MCYCShadow,Literally useless,"i had hopes that this app would enable you to view the entire sketchfab site in VR 
but nope, this is just a lite version with some nice to look at models and nothing else. That is really useless regarding that chrome is not reliable and doesnt even allow me to use the VR features since the needed drivers are not avaiable","Aug 21, 2020 at 10:24 PM",1, 8,
2022-05-28 17:31:47.403186,iWufei,This could have been something but...,"Unfortunately there is very littel content and it hasn't been updated or improved since it first launched. I was hoping to browse through the vast archive of models from different cretators, but you only get four very low quality models in VR.","May 25, 2020 at 5:11 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 17:31:47.418146,Just777,Awesome inspiration & scale for things!,"Cool app, but nearly anything that is in VR is amazing for me. Blew me away when I entered one of the Cathedrals in the minecraft (or voxel) model examples. The share scale and actually feeling your there is so cool. I already have Minecraft VR for Rift and Gear Vr for a while, but after being in the example it really inspired me to build bigger things! :D Seeing giants, dinosaurs, massive machines are so cool too! The only weakness as most have pointed out is that it has no free locomotion, but it's free! ;)","Oct 2, 2019 at 7:46 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 17:31:47.434103,rchrdcrg,What a waste!,"An outdated, pre-selected collection without any kind of free movement. Feels like a forgotten VR app from years ago and wastes so much potential.","Jul 5, 2019 at 11:21 PM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 17:31:50.560741,nymb,Has potential..,Allow to pull up all models from the website and you will have 5 stars from all.,"May 22, 2019 at 2:01 PM",2, 7,

2022-05-28 17:31:50.590661,KentonBailey,Stupid menu gets in the way of models,"I wanted to like this app, but I can't even look at a model up close without a huge menu occluding the center of my vision everytime my gaze lands on the model.","May 3, 2019 at 8:25 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 17:31:50.604624,MrWhitenoise,only a handfull of boring models to view,"""millions of awesome models that can be explored""   can be read in the description multiple times and is also the subtitle in the vr apps mainmenu.
but this app only shows a very very small selection of very boring and not really well made items.  just a handfull of stuff that looks like its made by kids who just started learning 3d.","Jan 20, 2019 at 8:23 PM",1, 7,
2022-05-28 17:31:50.619583,ALTernative.MS,"Stupid UI, Backround music, why?","How can i find model by name ? it's looks like a slideshow of ""skybox|cubemap""s :( I am extremely disappointed","May 20, 2018 at 9:07 PM",1, 7,
2022-05-28 17:31:53.721288,SmugGraveDigger,Shame on SketchFab,"As a HUGE player in the 3D Modeling industry, this app from sketchfab SUCKS! Did you give this development project to a couple of coding interns to produce SketchFab?! Can't view my own personal sketchfab account models?! I can't lookup good 3D artists?! I can't pan around the handful of crudy models you included in this app?! LAME, waste of time and HD space. I expected more as a champion of 3D and VR SketchFab :(","Jan 18, 2018 at 11:23 AM",1, 11,
2022-05-28 17:31:53.736247,Gommster,How to view all Sketchfab models in VR,"This app doesn't work anymore so don't be surprised when it won't install.
However you don't need it as you can view any sketchfab model in full VR with your rift using Firefox and by pressing the VR button in the browser on sketchfab (has to be Firefox as it uses WebVR which Chrome doesn't support)

2022-05-28 17:31:53.765170,the4thaggie,"I love Sketchfab, but limited capability","I am a 3D artist who uses the excellent Sketchfab service.  They offer VR support with my own models, but the WebVR experience is not really supported in modern browsers.  It would be extremely appreciated if they brought access to my own portfolio in app instead of just showcase content...","Jul 16, 2017 at 1:09 AM",2, 12,
2022-05-28 17:31:53.779133,neuro27,No Updates for a Year,"This is certainly not what I expected, and from the discussions reflect the same.

This product is nothing merely more than a showcase of SketchFab's 'Currated' list. Sure it's a good list, but I thought the point of a program like this was to let you browse other's work. This is not the case.

Also when you look down at something to have a closer look, a UI Menu pops up and blocks vision, very poor foresight. Came back after a year hoping for an update, but nothing. The app seems totally abandoned and there is no new content to speak of.","May 21, 2017 at 12:13 AM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 17:31:56.891807,cyberOwen,Loved it,"Great models, easy, comfortable viewing. Good navigation too. Next view of model starts where you're facing so you don't get tangled up with your lead.","Jun 10, 2017 at 6:28 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:31:56.906768,jon,Not worth the download,"The application isn't a browser of models available through their website, but rather of a small selection of models they've chosen to include within the app.  (a dozen or so)

Why they wouldn't make this browser open to all their online content is beyond me.","Apr 13, 2017 at 8:14 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 17:31:56.921728,nasenkobold,useless,what's this even supposed to be good for? the logical thing would have been the ability to browse and view all of the models available at sketchfab.com in VR. instead you can view only a handfull of select content...something like 10 models in total. what a waste of potential.,"Mar 2, 2017 at 4:50 AM",1, 9,
2022-05-28 17:31:56.936687,WKGB_Prewitt,"Cool, interesting, free.","Some of the textures and models are kind off, but a really neat idea.","May 8, 2017 at 8:28 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 17:31:56.951647,karrtoon,I would recommend using chromium instead,"This app only has a few sketchfab models in the app. Instead you can just use the chomium browser with built in webvr support and view all of the models on sketchfab.com in VR with the CV1. On sketchfab.com with chromium the model viewing selection is pretty much endless. Protip: Once you get chromium working you can use O and P to scale the models larger and smaller, WASD for movement.

2022-05-28 17:32:00.035399,Julius-X,"Good visuals, limited usability.","Shows you some nice visuals of what SketchVab on VR is capable of, but really isn't useful otherwise.  It'd be great if you could browser through Sketchfab and load other models/experiences, but those options aren't even here.","Jan 3, 2017 at 12:45 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 17:32:00.050359,DrVirtual,Reviews are crazy,People know no bounds in complaining about a free app. Yes it isn't perfect but what is here is beautiful. I'd rather have a small collection of high quality models than an endless list of broken models. Had fun with the dinos and look forward to seeing this grow with more content.,"Apr 30, 2017 at 12:42 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 17:32:00.065319,SwordfishKnight,It's a start...,Very limited selection of models. Could definitely benefit from Touch control integration.,"Dec 19, 2016 at 5:29 AM",2, 4,
