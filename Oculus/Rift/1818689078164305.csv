My Quick Thoughts:
From the creative minds that brought us the classic and wonderful 'Job Simulator' comes another MASTERPIECE!
If anyone knows how to make a really good immersive, fun and interactive VR game, you can count on Owlchemy Labs.
This is simply superb and another classic in the making!","Sep 11, 2020 at 11:38 PM",5, 36,
2022-05-28 13:00:35.739189,Zaiden,No Cross Buy = 0 Stars if I could,The fact that Facebook even allows developers to do this is ridiculous.  Every single game I have purchased with my Rift should be included with any other future device.

It has pleasant graphics/sound and a huge number of what amount to basically ""minigames"" to play within the game.  That said, it is mostly suitable for smaller children or maybe older non-gamers, as everything is quite shallow.

2022-05-28 13:00:45.274457,PersonYe,Great Game!,"Vacation Simulator is really action packed. It has many things to do, like fishing, or taking pictures of certain objects. It is a fantastic game, but I do have some complaints.

1. Gets very repetitive, especially when you waste hours in the sandcastle building area.

2. Doesn't really give hints where to find certain objects, like a bot, or a food item.

That's mostly all of my complaints, also whenever I have played a game that says its intense, or moderate, I don't feel sick. But whenever I play Vacation Simulator I feel nautious. It might be the constant teleporting all over the place.","Nov 30, 2019 at 9:11 AM",4, 32,

But...,"It was super fun when you had all of these memories and I had such a good time doing all of them and it was so accomplishing to get all 70 of them (I FREAKED when I saw Job Bot). However the gameplay after you get all of the memories isn't as fun and there really isn't as much to do. But I have a few ways to make it better:
-Have more memories to do in all of the areas
-When you complete all of the food orders, sandbox and ice sculpting blueprints, make some new extra ones to do afterward or maybe enable the option to do them again.
-New area idea: Vacation Park! Basically it's an amusment park with roller coasters and carnival rides, games, food, etc. and I could see some good ideas with that, preparing and reparing rides, whipping up carnival food, etc.
So yeah those are some ideas that I have to improve the game. But even with all of that Vacation Simulator is overall one of my favorite VR titles! Keep up the good work!","Jul 30, 2019 at 12:23 PM",4, 27,

2022-05-28 13:00:54.716937,Neuramir,A delightful sequel,"Vacation Simulator is a lot fun to play. There is a lot to do, which is a problem in most VR games currently.
Each of the locations have fun activities to do, and awesome experiences such as the geyser and the underwater shipwreck.
The game can get repetitive, but for the most part, it's a great experience and I would recommend it.","Jun 30, 2019 at 6:23 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 13:00:54.734889,HelloAlice2019,"My 7 year old loves it, so do I, except:","This game is beautiful, with lots of fun puzzles and activities, colorful well-designed graphics, and many characters to interact with. Loved Job Simulator, and honestly think this game is even better, because:
1. The 3 vacation locations are awesome.
2. You have an ability to travel within each location (by click teleporting)

However, this game was a little less than hoped for (waiting for it with my kids for months, and eagerly forked out $29.99 for it), because:
1. (minor) Wish there was an option to hide ""delete player"" red shredder. My son put our player in the shredder and thus, deleted all the game progress without an option of restoring it.

2. (important) I completely agree with another 4 star review: lack of visual movement during transitions (especially when moving to new spot in each location after having earned memories, like driving the boat to a diving site or going in a cable car up the mountain) was very disappointing and greatly took away from VR immersion.

QUESTION FOR DEVELOPERS:

Could you guys add actual movement transitions to new scenes in the game either as:
1. controller thumbstick movements
2. in-game manipulation with controller ""hands"" (e.g., traveling faster/slower using controls on the boat going to dive site, ski lift cable car up mountain, etc.)
3. non-interactive video segments of going on a boat to diving site, ski lift cable car up the mountain, etc.?","Apr 12, 2019 at 12:39 AM",4, 148,
2022-05-28 13:00:54.749849,Atlas1021,Best Sim Ever,"Lets start off by saying that this game has way more content than Job Simulator, thare are 3 main areas, Vacation Beach, Vacation Forest, and Vacation Mountain, each with their own sub-areas. The beach has a dive site, the forest has a hiking trail, and the mountain has the overlook. 

1A. The beach has tons of things to do like:
- Grilling Burgers
- Playing Sports
- Doing Yoga
- Finding Butterflies
- Building Sandcastles
- Taking Photos
- RELAXING
1B. The dive site has less things to do but here they are:
- Taking Photos
- Playing Songs
- Admiring the Robo-Fish
- Shooting Rings for Dolphins
- Finding BotBeards Treasure

2A. The forest has some great things too like:
- Painting
- Catching Fish
- Grilling
- Campfire Stories
- Rafting
- Shooting Targets
- Hiking
- Taking Photos
- Gardening
2B. The hinkng trail has the following:
- Birdwatching
- Skipping Rocks
- Becoming an Animal
- Helping RaftBot find his way back
- Activating the Gyser
- Eating Berries

3A. The mountain has all kinds of fun things to do like:
- Having Snowball Fights
- Making Ice Sculptures
- Taking Photos
- Chilling in a Hot Tub
- Making Drinks and Pies
- Doing Puzzles
- Knitting
- Making a Snowman
- Meeting Jacksepticeye
3B. The overlook has some more fun winter things like:
- Skiing
- Making Icecream
- Climbing a rock wall
- Finding the abomitable snow bot
- Climbing to the Peak
- Putting a flag on the Peak

Overall an AMAZING game and i would totally Reccommend it!

2022-05-28 13:01:01.031300,RuneSR2,Nice game for (small) kids,"Fun game - my 7 and 11 year old sons really love it. The atmosphere is great, colors will make you in a good mood. But most of the content is not for teenagers or adults - unless you like to build sand castles and collect a few butterflies - and eat tons of virtual food. The levels of onscreen polys are low - feels like a game for low end hardware like Quest or PSVR, this games definitely isn't developed for high-end Rift gamers. There're no real textures in the game - much like Windlands 2. The game is just 1GB download. There're no video settings - the only option to improve graphics is to crank up super sampling using programs like Oculus Tray Tool. Doing that the game runs perfectly in 90 fps using super sampling 2.0 on a GTX 1080. Furthermore the bright colors and background make it nearly impossible to see any god rays on the Rift. And the game is super polished. I'd recommend this game for kids ages 5 to 10, it really isn't for adults - but then again, maybe the game can reduce stress and work like some kind of mindfulness therapy for adults ;-) Price should be 15 or 20 bucks - 30 are way too high unless more content arrives. No control option to enable thumb stick turning is really bad - you can only turn using your whole body, so it's impossible to play this game when sitting in a chair. There's no support for full locomotion at all - you can only teleport. This means that no one will experience any nausea, but it also reduces immersion and feels like an old school game from 2016. Still my sons agree - this game deserves 5 stars with no doubt.","Apr 15, 2019 at 5:59 AM",5, 27,

2022-05-28 13:01:04.236884,pecannoodles,Great!,"I loved all of Owlchemy Lab's games before and this one is even better. It grows on the experiment gameplay of Rick And Mory VR with the humour of Job Simulator. But to compare it to those games would be a diservice because it's a whole new thing. Each resort acts as a small open world (similar to 2017's Mario Odyessey) where you can collect ""memories"" similar to the Jigsaw pieces in Banjo Kazooie. I only have 2 hours in but it is already phenomenal. 98% out of 5.","Apr 10, 2019 at 9:21 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 13:01:04.251843,CaptBatty,It's amazing!,"The plot, the characters, the graphics, it was all amazing. It may have even surpassed Job Simulator. I have a suggestion for Owlchemy Labs, though. CONFERENCE SIMULATOR! It's like a crossover of Vacationing and Jobbing, with all 4 bots together in the same game. Can't wait for more games, Owlchemy!","Apr 14, 2019 at 7:44 AM",5, 6,

We designed each layout for the game to be suited to the player's playspace-- if you're having trouble reaching things, we recommend recalibrating your room-scale setup (Guardian setup) to make sure the game is loading the appropriate layout for your playspace. If you continue encountering issues with reaching certain items, send us a message at owlchemysupport@google.com and we'll work with you to resolve the issue! -Owlchemy"
