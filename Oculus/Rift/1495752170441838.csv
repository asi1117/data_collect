For having played a lot of puzzle games, which is my main focus, all those I did have the possibility of pausing, often by calling the menu and we resume the game there. was asking ""continue"" or ""resume"".
Besides, this function seems essential, because of course the progression of a game is saved only at certain points in the progression, often at the end of the resolution of all the puzzles in a room, a site or a scene.
I think this function is essential, either to know how to have an essential human function :-), or to give time for reflection on the enigma to solve.
Out of curiosity, I consulted several user sites to see their impression, and I found that several abandoned the game, not accepting the strategy of the game.
On the principle of a defined time to find an enigma, agree and repeat this enigma from the beginning = yes, but that you impose to start ALL the GAME again when you have already spent several ten minutes on the other enigmas. , you necessarily discourage the player. Restart puzzles already found ... Never seen in other games.
For the reimbursement, unfortunately I think I have exceeded the time and deadline conditions, but I wanted to test several times to be sure of what I was advancing in my grievances.
A particular request, on the figures for the clock: why the position of the figures (numbers) is different between the paper positioned in the inventory box and the paper when you select it? is it a trick or a programming error?
Cordially.","Jun 13, 2020 at 8:14 PM",1, 8,"Hi there, thanks for your review! Hope you got your reimbursement! Anyway, the game indeed has a timeout when you stop progressing the game, that is communicated to the player by how fast his heart beats. The idea is that you need to escape from it FAST otherwise the ""Evil Rabbit""comes to get you. The time should not progress if you put your headset into sleep mode, if does this is a bug indeed. Cheers."

2022-05-28 19:04:31.672302,Thursby,One of the clues is badly misleading,"Go ahead and cheat on the clock puzzle. The clue is wrong. Other than that its an enjoyable little escape room game.

In answer to the inquiry, there is a main clue to the clock puzzle, a note with numbers. The 3 and 8 are transposed. Its  a shame because the puzzle was really well designed. But transposing numbers in the clue was careless. If it was intentional, thats no fun either.","Mar 31, 2020 at 6:35 AM",3, 4,"Can you explain to us why the clue is wrong? The numbers on the paper should be in the right position, aren't they?"
2022-05-28 19:04:31.688259,Vulpelux,Either the game is broken or unclear,"Can't reach the clock puzzle or handle on the bookshelf but it lights up. Hovering over objects too far away to interact with does not light them up, as a gamer I take the cues I'm given and these cues suggest that these items should be interactable. They are not, a review below me was answered by the developers and these items need a potion to access them. This is terrible game design. If I try to interact with something I cannot one of two things should happen: 1) A message pops up telling me I need to perform an action, in this case obtain a potion, in order to interact with these items, 2) The items should not highlight in the first place if I can't interact with them yet.

High up objects and puzzles are not the only things though. In a grate in the wall is a cupcake, you can highlight it but again no interaction. Makes sense, it's in a freaking grate but there's also a cupcake under the bed and again I cannot interact with this. Based on the high up objects it's possible you need a shrinking cake to interact with these things but... I would have thought the cupcakes were those cakes so I don't know what to think. Without any indication as to whether the game is operating correctly or being non-responsive we as gamers are forced to assume good game design and glitchy programming rather than bad game design and operational programming. So far I think the game has a tonne of potential and I actually enjoy it a lot (even though I have no clue where that blasted key is or what I'm supposed to do next) but this one flaw makes it difficult to trust the cues the game is giving me. Making a puzzle game that isn't clear is not exactly the best thing ever. I recommend making just that small change suggested above, either 1 or 2, it'll make the game a lot clearer, improve the impression of players, immersion and help foster trust between the game and gamer which is what you need to get more stars guys.","Oct 26, 2019 at 10:58 AM",2, 8,"Thanks for this amazing review, looks like you really has enjoyed the game. In fact it is a bug that items out of your reach should not be highlighted. I will ask the team to fix this and probably most of your concerns should be done ;)"
2022-05-28 19:04:31.702222,The_Viceman,Nice little game,"For those who cannot grab objects in high places, use the items in your inventory and see the world from new perspective. But anyways, it was fun for its price (got it from sale). There was some technical issues, like using objects was bit tricky and getting stuck into some objects in. The puzzles were ok, nothing special there. Would be easily 4 star game if the touch controllers works better.","Sep 12, 2019 at 3:21 PM",3, 0,"Thanks for the feedback Viceman! I am unsure if it was you that sent us an email, but I would love to hear how would you improve the controllers! Cheers"
2022-05-28 19:04:34.818886,TheAssassinsWay,Not working properly,"Game looks like it has potential. But a few things are not working.  For some reason I am unable to obtain the handle on the bookshelf, the potion on the chandalier and I am not able to activate the 'Clock Puzzle' . Won't even let me in to try and solve it.  It seems like everything that is up high will not interact with me (even though my pointer highlights it).  Please fix or refund my $$  Thanks.","Sep 4, 2019 at 2:37 AM",1, 1,"Hi there, sorry for the confusion, but theses items are only reachable when using the drink me up potion. Please open your inventory and, after getting one of the bottles, you may be able to do everything ;)"
2022-05-28 19:04:34.833846,HSaturn,,"Sorry, but I cannot grab the closet handle, neither the potion in the chandelier... I've solved the puzzle and the music box and took all what was possible. There is no help on how to grab upper objects...","Sep 4, 2019 at 4:29 AM",1, 0,"Hi HSaturn, sorry it took us so long to reply this, I am not getting mail notifications on reviews I AM SORRY! You need to drink the potion in your inventory so you may reach these items!"
2022-05-28 19:04:34.848806,baggyg,A series of poor design decisions,"It makes me wonder whether any testers have spent any time actually playing this game on Oculus. If they had I can't imagine how we have a game in this state. It really could have been great, but is constantly marred by bad execution and poor choices. 

Pros:
Some decent puzzles.
Good Grow / Shrink Mechanic.

Cons:
Insanely dark to the point where you can barely make things out.
Combine the above with blinding lights and it is god ray city.
Free movement but no strafe, which feels unnatural .
Walk speed when small is tediously slow .
Unecessary and jarring timer run out event (cheap and pointless jump scare).
Generally clunky controls. 
Unecessary finite resources masks poor puzzle design.

Overall I started to enjoy this game and got a couple of puzzles right. However it wasn't long before I was back frustrated again and squinting to make out details. I would have probably considered giving this 2 or 3 stars if wasn't that stupid jump scare. I really cannot understand why the developers thought this was cool. The challenge here should be to work you way through puzzles and explore rather than arbitrarily having a countdown.","Feb 28, 2018 at 6:22 AM",1, 10,"Hey baggy, how are you doing?
Thanks for the review, most of it you got it right. We understood that some people are much less sensitive to light, and in VR this is make a huge difference. We are finishing a Remaster version where we changed all the lighting in the project. Not sure if you had tried the option to make the game brighter in the MainMenu, this could aid while you wait for the update. The free movement was done sometime ago and we had in mind to create something that was also comfortable (wrong choice) this update will also fix it. And about the Endgame scare jump, it is not that arbitrary, in fact it is a timer that resets every time the player does advance in the game, the countdown can be heard as a heartbeat and should warn the player to try to look for other hints, instead of be on only one puzzle (you can solve problems in several orders). Sorry that your experience was not really good, and hope you can give a try after the update. If you have any other thoughts please contact us through mail or facebook we will be happy to hear you."
2022-05-28 19:04:34.863766,rh_galaxy,This is not a horror game,"A hard puzzle game is what it is, with mediocre graphics. I didn't finish it so I have an incomplete view but gave the game maybe 2 hours.","Oct 19, 2017 at 11:19 PM",2, 4,"Hi @rh_galaxy, how are you doing?
Yeah this game is a Puzzle game (Escape Room) and has the environments of a Horror game. It is not focused on jump scares or ""walking corridors simulators"". The game is not that long if you manage to pass the puzzles, but the price is also not that high. We hope we can release new levels for it, but this depends a lot of the success of the game.
Thanks for playing the game and be free to give you feedback direct to us on facebook as well!"
