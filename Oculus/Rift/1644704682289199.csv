2022-05-28 15:18:14.938582,davemay89,,"like the game but it has two huge flaws.  theres no one playing online and to make matters worse, its cross buy but I cannot connect my rift and quest together for multiplayer.  this is utter crap and makes the game almost unplayable.  I really hope an update comes where they fix this issue but i do have faith as more quests get sold this game will get an online player base because the game is very solid and the visuals are great and the game is fun.  If there is a way to link my 2 headsets together please let me know and if the developers are listening please add this feature not just for people like me but vr arcades too","May 18, 2020 at 11:21 AM",2, 27,
2022-05-28 15:18:14.957531,JanTom,Not for the Rift,"If you have a big room, and a Oculus Quest its a good nice game. If your room is average and you have a cable for your headset you will slam into walls, come across unreachable areas. I cannot play because I have areas I need to walk to that are too far away! They just sold it, and scammed me.","Mar 19, 2020 at 1:48 AM",1, 10,"Hello JanTom,
The Playable area will scale with the size of your guardian, if you're encountering situations where you cannot reach an area, you should try setting your guardian to a smaller area, that will scale the playable area for you.

2022-05-28 15:18:14.974486,KStro9,Cross Play...but only sort of!,"This game is cross buy but not completely cross play.  If you have a Quest and a Rift, you will NOT be able to play with family at home.  This is not like Racket NX, Dead and Burried 2, Rush, and most other cross play games that allow you to play against your own device with family at home.  The game intentionally does not allow you to hook up to your other device (per the developer Armature).  To me, this is a fatal flaw, especially considering there are reviews here complaining about not having enough players to play against. Since this is not available outside of Oculus and your devices are linked to your account, there are few options to work around this, even in the unlikely event that you liked it so much, you were inclined to buy it twice.

The game is a fun and a unique idea, but not as fun when you can't share it with family.  I would recomend one of the other cross play games that allow this instead.","Dec 28, 2019 at 12:58 AM",1, 24,"Hello KStro9,

2022-05-28 15:18:14.989446,Spalman_yt,Solid game with a few flaws,"The game itself is actually great, especially the concept guarantees for an unique experience everytime you play. But the physics seem very off sometimes, especially during baseball, it seems that no matter how hard you try to hit the ball, it always flies very far. And the fact that although you already played them, you can't skip the explanations in training/challenge mode, which makes the game process unneccessary lenghty.","Jan 25, 2020 at 9:52 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 15:18:18.106110,taquitobuddy,Good presentation but lacking overall,"Pros
-Nicely polished presentation, colorful graphics.
-Decent selection of options and modes, along with trophies and cosmetics
-Multiplayer

Cons
-Frequent poor physics on all modes, even ""pro"".  Not just fun, cartoon physics, but in some cases just plain buggy.  (batting in baseball is especially bad)
-No interaction with your opponent at all in bowling, and limited gameplay in baseball and tennis with drastically reduced features/rules.  


Overall, definately wouldn't recommend, especially at $30.  Maybe in the $5-10 range.  For single player content, something like VR Sports Challenge is a much better game.  And for multiplayer there are better sports-esque options available as well.","Aug 14, 2019 at 5:34 PM",2, 11,"Hello AnnatarRedeemed,

2022-05-28 15:18:18.121070,paulohotline,Thanks Oculus for making this crossplay!,This game was awesome on the Quest. Now I can play it on the Rift at no extra charge. I love the ability to have Oculus Friends added in multiplayer quickly so I can challenge my friends to a game of tennis while trashtalking them :) 5/5 John McEnroe Bobbleheads.,"Aug 5, 2019 at 10:04 AM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 15:18:18.136030,CaptainStrongNuts,5 star game and cross buy,"This game sets the standard for fun vr play, and cross buy between Oculus Rift and Oculus Quest.  My favorite game on Quest, and will now be a regular on Rift as well.  The physics are great, game play is unique and makes me want to get better and play more.  Cuddos to the devs and team who worked on this, YOU GUYS ROCK!","Aug 9, 2019 at 3:18 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 15:18:18.149993,NOOBDUDEMANDUDE,AMMMAAZZINNNG,"This game has everything I want in a VR sports game. The gameplay, the physics; everything feels great! I love the twist of mixing everything! It makes every game you play feel different and more exciting! And if you DONT want the crazy, you can just play the normal sport WITHOUT scrambling. This game is a must-buy for any sport buff  who is looking for a cool VR expierience. I could play this forever!","Aug 14, 2019 at 12:18 AM",5, 2,
