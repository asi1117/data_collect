2022-05-28 15:35:06.937846,Peaceteddie,I vaguely remember it used to work?,"I think this game used to be good? Don't know what happened but now i cannot pause in the game, the floor is too low and its just feels bad.","Aug 28, 2020 at 5:21 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 15:35:06.952806,Mizu1993,,"The first game was awesome, so that's why I also bought this one, but I got disappointed. Many things don't work as they should. If you have to make Katsudon, that's when you know it will take many many seconds, too many. Because the meat is very hard to pick up after you cut it. Actually many things are hard to pick up because your hands are big as a football. But back to the meat: It can even fall through the table and get stuck there, then you have to find the missing meet piece inside the table....somewhere or under it.","Jun 26, 2020 at 1:50 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 15:35:06.968763,ierika,Please make it available for Quest,I’m top 45 now in the 5 min challenge.,"May 24, 2019 at 12:53 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 15:35:06.983724,ashiren,love this game,love this game.  i only wish it was also available for the quest.,"Nov 23, 2019 at 6:44 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:35:06.998683,Nonebetter,Amazingly fun!,"So fun! get a great workout grinding those leaderboards.
Similar to ramen shop but more dishes and you can dodge the unhappy customers attacks, also there is a super cute cat bonus.
These games are well worth the price, love the classic style, a must have for anyone","Mar 26, 2019 at 7:03 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:35:10.107369,SteveLeeee,Game turned out to be a frustrating mess,"I checked to see if my controllers were malfunctioning or something, but it wasn't the case.
The game just didn't know when I did and did not want to hold something. Found myself dropping items non-stop. Simply trying to close the hand in-game was pretty much all RNG and made this game impossible to play.","Mar 9, 2019 at 3:33 AM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 15:35:10.122329,Azreala,Fun Game!,"I really enjoy playing this, and am always try to beat my ranking score.  I have lots of VR games with amazing graphics, complicated gameplay and hours of content but I often find myself jumping into this one to just 'have some quick fun'.","Jan 20, 2019 at 11:47 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:35:10.136291,xlc,Yum!!,"Great game, lots of fun. I wish I could change my height though... Maybe I just didn't see the option","Nov 14, 2018 at 8:24 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 15:35:10.150254,AutumnPioneer,Lots and lots of fun,"This game is really great, theres no teleporting around, just a straight up little food stand where you have to serve people as fast as possible! Theres quite a few dishes which makes it challenging at times as they require different methods of cooking. Sometimes the background can look quite sharp and jagged, i think thats because there's no AA. One of my favourite VR games.","Dec 19, 2018 at 4:28 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:35:10.165214,Reboot_404,So Much Fun!,This is definately a game I come back to. This game gets you moving and sweating and is tons of fun!,"Feb 16, 2018 at 7:51 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:35:13.239990,air805ronin,,"A fun game for quick bouts of activity.  It is a little harder than the normal counter fight because of a bigger variety of dishes.  Different versions of their gyudon dishes take different cooking methods so you're juggling between a grill, a fryer, and a station just for cooking eggs.

It gets more hectic and the overall leaderboard scores seem a lot lower than the normal Counter Fight.","Nov 6, 2017 at 1:13 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 15:35:13.254950,Mr.Joysticks,,"Counter Fight SE is tons of fun.  There isn't a ton of content outside of 5 minute/endless, and after playing for a bit with friends I really wish they'd add more recipes.  What you do have though, is an addicting good time for you and some friends, and for its price its definitely worth it.","Nov 3, 2017 at 6:07 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:35:13.269910,zaraion,a fun game to play for hours.,you've definitely played a similar game but you're going to see how hetic it becomes. I'm looking forward to more games by them.,"Nov 5, 2017 at 9:37 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:35:13.284870,Crixmedine,Quite tasty!,"This is actually a lot of fun! You really get a sense of that you're the chef standing there and throwing fishes and shrimps to plaease your customers, although they will be pissed off sometimes. Really immersive, mechanics are a bit buggy but nothing to worry to much about. Great value!","Jun 17, 2017 at 9:35 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 15:35:13.299830,LetterAfterZ,,"Look at games like Diner Duo for a better example of this kind of game. The elements are too fiddly and small things fly off into space or get wedged into each other. The game only really features an endless mode with a handful of recipes, so there's very little sense of progression. Potential, but feels incomplete.","Jun 10, 2017 at 1:54 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 15:35:16.391561,ThunderFlicker,Most hectic game i own,"This game is actaully very exciting. Not to mention it has more recipies then the last iteration, each recipie is different and fun to cook, and a bullet time cat.... a bullet time cat. this game is worth your money.","Jun 9, 2017 at 9:26 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 15:35:16.406521,Benside,Any tiny object disappears on cut board,All tiny object disappears on cut board if you don't want another EA game i do not recommend this.,"Jun 9, 2017 at 1:25 PM",1, 0,Thank you for your review. The problem was fixed in version 1.0.6. Please try again.
