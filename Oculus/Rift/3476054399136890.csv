2022-05-28 20:16:02.067145,ThatGuyYK,Best VRMMO to date!,"I have been following this game since it’s Kickstarter days and saw it flourish into this action-packed game, the ￼social aspects are amazing. I made more than a few friends in just my first hour or two of playing, creating a party and entering the dungeon in the starting plains. The combat is diverse and fun but can get repetitive (as all MMOs do), personally I liked using blade master ad I liked being up close and personal to my enemies.
Overall it is a great game, with more storyline and content it could easily be the starting point to all vrmmo’s.",20 days ago,5, 11,
2022-05-28 20:16:02.082105,kevin3inches,end game,the game is great super fun and 100% worth it. The map is huge and and really is just an amazing experience. But once you reach end game there is nothing. there is no super hard end game dungeon or much to do at all end game. If they were to add some new hard bosses or dungeon it would make the end game fantastic,Apr 14 at 9:43 AM,4, 25,
2022-05-28 20:16:02.097064,Kalman98,Your hopes are accurate.,"I've been playing Zenith since the pre-alpha. I have watched it grow for three years.

It will not disappoint you.

You can quest. Kill enemies. Collect resources. Cook food. Participate in world events, battle bosses, venture to dungeons.

Every aspect of the game is exactly what you're dreaming it to be.

Explore - oh, there's so much to explore. The world is beautiful; more than a few times will you find your breath taken away as you step back for a second. There are secrets hidden in so many places.

Meet with friends. Make new ones. The community is extremely positive and every member is happy to be a part of something this special.

Never before have I seen a dev group so dedicated to making their project the best it can be. They've sacrificed and crunched at ridiculously inhuman levels to get the game to us, with such speed, no less - and they've done it all with the greatest of passion and enthusiasm.

They have promised updates and much more content for years to come, and have already outlined many of the features on the roadmap for the near future. This game is just getting started.

Buy the game. It is what you're hoping it to be. Zenith is something truly special, the likes of which has never been seen before.

You won't regret it.",Jan 28 at 1:09 PM,5, 232,
2022-05-28 20:16:02.112024,SekaiNoOusama,Amazing!,"Has all the pieces of an mmo, which is amazing to see in VR. The fighting is fun and creative (different hand motions for different spells as a mage). Love the climbing & gliding as well, it really brings it to another level. Plus all the small things like a fun cooking interface, ingrediant gathering, item crafting, etc. It's really everything I was wanting. As a new & ambitious game, there's still some bugs of course, but I'm excited to see all the updates!",14 days ago,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:16:02.125987,LzYorHa,Played Since the Pre-Alpha.,"I've played since the first testing period of Zenith. The game has been extremely enjoyable since the beginning. I've watched this be built from scratch and all I have to say is that it's extremely heart-touching seeing the massive influx of new players come in. I don't think there's been a single moment during all of my playtimes that I've ever regretted the decision of backing the game. It's let me escape the real world and immerse myself in a life with new possibilities and new adventures to go on. I've made countless friends and have countless stories to tell. All from the funny bugs, we found to the defeat of the world boss, nothing is impossible in Zenith. With a will and some trusty friends, you'll embark on an adventure of a lifetime. -BallsDeep69",Jan 29 at 8:07 AM,5, 200,
2022-05-28 20:16:05.237327,Nazgulious,not good yet,"got great potential, had fun for 2 weeks (gameplay) but endgame is practicaly not there. there realy isnt any dungeon, collecting items is not rely fun and many tiers of items quickly fills your inventory like good quality and bad quality (and quality does not do anything) items also prevents u from casting spells when there are many on floor in mids of battle, there are holes in map evrywhere, unfinished texstures, funny looking things. also u cannot change color of armor and it makes you look very pinkish, cooking is fun for awhile but then u just start to burn evrything and imo needs alot of polishing. i see that devs are trying but thay are taking their time.",21 days ago,3, 3,
2022-05-28 20:16:05.253284,Foufoutos01,Great game but needs some fixes,"Thanks devs for the great work you have done so far. I see a lot of potential here and hope over time it will become even better. I would love to give you the 5th star but there are some issues that hold me of.
MOST IMPORTANTLY although I can connect and play on my Quest 2 standalone, when I try to run the Rift client (which is the way I would prefer to play as it is supposed to be of superior quality) it just refuses to connect. I reach the title screen and get a message saying ""Internet connection is available. checking account"" but stucks there forever. I have tried many times throughout the last 3 days and always get the same result (so I believe it cannot be due to servers being fulll... it shall be something else). I would greatly appreciate a response on how this can be fixed.
Other than that, on the quest version I encountered something that may be a bug or may be me doing something stupid without realizing it... Once I reached level 5 I suddenly started getting an alert that I am on a zone that is for lvl 2 and I have to go out and return when I am ready... I checked my stats and realized that my characted was showing as lvl 1 and the weapons I was holding had returned to my inventory (as they were for lvl5). the next day when I logged back the characted was still showing lvl1 ingame (on the characted selection it was showing lvl5) but thankfully after 10-15 minutes of trying everything I could in the menus it returned back to normal... if this is a function (i.e. similar to FFXIV when you change role) then it is not well documented, if it is a bug then I hope it gets fixed and never encounter it again...
Another issue is misising quest markers on the map & minimap.
Overal I hope that this game will solve its issues soon and will grow to be the 1st great MMO for VR.
I will revise my review hoping to give you the 5th star as soon as I play a little more and manage to run the PC client. thanks again for your work and keeping the pricing reasonable.",Jan 30 at 1:13 AM,4, 63,
2022-05-28 20:16:05.269241,OutlawISILDUR,The world gets bigger and bigger,"I am new to the whole MMO style of game, but thought what not give it a go and expand my horizons so to speak. It's been a good decision so far.
As I write this review I am level 15 and working my way through the quests in the forest. I have encountered some bugs, the cooking station has played up a few times and the other day the srvers were down.
You can really tell how much you like  game when you can't actually play it, I was very dissapointed.
I find the whole experience very immersive and have met some cool people on my travels. The community for the most part are very helpful, you will always get the odd weirdo online. I hope that this game gets the support to grow and develop and expand and I look forward to seeig where the developers take this game.",Apr 16 at 4:37 PM,5, 1,

However it's easy to look past when you have the profound epifany, this is like the first time you played WoW. It's brand new, and the first of it's kind to do something really great with the new ways of gaming. We're just in vanilla here, but I can't wait to see where this leads in the next few years.

2022-05-28 20:16:08.396031,FullTryhard,Polished but lacks variety,"There are really only a few things to do right now. I'll change my review as things change in-game.

Edit 3/7/2022: Adding a star because I do see that the devs are adding content to the game but the lower levels still feel like a bit of a slog. I've made very little progress because there's very little guiding you on where you need to go and then the game punishes you severely if you die by spawning you a mile away. It causes me to get almost nothing productive done by the time I need to take the headset off from VR sickness. These things need some work. Will keep updating as I check back on the game from time to time. Better respawn points would be nice. Also there needs to be a BIG BRIGHT NEON sign guiding other players that someone needs a revive, it's not obvious enough and players will walk past your body because they aren't made immediately aware of your situation. Also it would be nice to make it so reviving other players grants a reward so that people are more likely to do it without having to turn on voice chat but put a 15 minute cooldown on the reward so players don't farm it. There needs to be a better and easier way to report players who deliberately abuse proximity chat to say racist or offensive things.",Mar 8 at 11:29 AM,2, 2,
2022-05-28 20:16:08.411988,KingGelbin,Great game,Lots to learn once you start playing but overall it's a very good game. Whatever quirks in the game I'm sure will be ironed out as the game progresses. This is a title that could really push people to finally dive into VR. UPDATE 3/2/22 I think there is some issue with how they are tracking active players? I will log into what is supposed to be a high population server only to find it dead. Still a very good game :),Mar 13 at 2:09 AM,4, 2,
2022-05-28 20:16:08.427947,Century777,OASIS IS HERE 👆,"OASIS IS HERE 👆
Finally, we (VR players) have our own Oasis, and what else 😎
This is a real full-fledged VR MMO, in which there are already a lot of possibilities and a large developed world at the start.

What else would I like to see at Zenit in the future:
--------------------------------------------------------
- Market and exchange system (economic system).
​- PVP / GW (I also want to play a war with live players).
- The profession of an Archer (it will be very cool 😎 The bow in this game just has to appear, then you can also add firearms as an option).
- Home ownership (construction, arrangement, vegetable garden, animal husbandry, etc.).
- A system of pets / homunculus (helping in pumping, and not only).
- Extremely rare cards / runes that fall from mobs with a small chance

Dreams 👀 :
----------------------
- Elemental system (several elements, for example - fire/earth/wind/water for both mobs and skills, weapons, clothing, etc.)
- A system of stats with manual distribution of points so that you can work more deeply on your build with an emphasis on survivability / strength / intelligence / dexterity / accuracy / speed, etc. (+ automatic distribution of stats for those who do not want to delve into it). It would be great, really 👍
That's all i want for now, but not necessarily right away. 😌

Nuances:
-----------
- Slots for cookies and other food often interfere with pumping when you take a cookie out of your pocket instead of a skill for a mob... 😳 And so on from time to time. Here it is necessary to coordinate the slots for food, or to place them in another more convenient place.
------------
I hope Zenith will be constantly updated and improved, and online will only grow for more than one year, because the game is already impressive and addictive at the start, and in 20 hours I tried only a small part, pumping the Magician up to level 10, including builds).

Many thanks to the developers for the game, everything turned out as well as possible 👍",Feb 2 at 1:55 AM,5, 15,
2022-05-28 20:16:08.443903,Slay85,It's a fun game.,"It's a grindy type,  anime style MMO.  I only played the mage type of what I could play, but I really enjoyed what I could.  The mics seemed to all work well.  There's some crafting in the game too.

I just can't get over the connectivity issues.  I have a quest 2 I can link to a VR computer.  I prefer to play wirelessly but it doesn't seem to have an effect on the connectivity issues.  I also have a solid 600/100 mp down/up connection.   I call it connectivity issues but it's really some kind of server issue.

Anytime a group of about 10 or more people get together on a server, it crashes.  Then it won't let you back into the game providing you the error that your character is already logged in.  Doesn't matter how great a game is, if you spend 75% of your time in loading screens and error messages, you'll eventually get frustrated as I did.

I talked to people in game and it seems it was just the quest 2 people having this issue.   

I hope they fix this in the future, I really would like to play this game.

Update:  3-24-22  The developer contacted me and encouraged me to submit a ticket, which I did.  After talking to more people in game, the consistent crashes happen on the crowded servers to quest 2 players.  The two shards I play on are frequently full and when you do the end boss, which is about all you can do at level 40, it consistenly logs you out.  Then you must wait a minute or so to log back in.  Seems to be an endgame problem and they do seem to be addressing it.    I will update my review in the future.",Mar 25 at 11:39 AM,2, 0,"Hello Slay85,

2022-05-28 20:16:08.458863,909C,An absolutely amazing game,"I personally love this game. A beautiful world, and amazing performance on the standalone quest. Cross-buy too. I don’t have much to say, as I believe the game speaks for itself, however I would like to see a way for mages to use a sword, and vice versa, because as a mage, I think it would be nice to have a hand where I can block with a sword and swing when in closer combat. I spent all of my resources to make a sword just to find out I can’t use it. Plus, I’m not even sure if there’s a way I can gift it to a newer player. Nonetheless, those are just my opinions on making the game that much better.",Feb 28 at 1:34 AM,5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:16:11.569730,PaladinUzuke,"Best option, but not a good option.","This is exactly like the rest of VR gaming. It's great for a VR game, but really nothing special, objectively. 
There are two types of quests: fetch, and kill. 
There is one profession: cooking. Calling it a profession is being generous. 
There are two classes, with a third planned, and while they do feel very different from one another, they are simple. Some people will tell you there are three subclasses for each, but that's really just a lie. Each class has a tank, healer, and DPS option.
The world feels empty. Now, if early access for this game is anything like the norm nowadays, it could be years before a full release. The developers could do a lot in that time. 
It's grindy and repetitive. It does not feel like an MMORPG. Just another 10% effort of the flat screen counterparts. Keep letting developers make VR games that are shadows to normal games, and that's all we will EVER get.",Feb 3 at 11:50 AM,2, 10,
2022-05-28 20:16:11.585688,Mar-,PCVR Version Good- Quest 2 Version Bad,"I played the Quest version on launch day and jeez, it made me disappointed because it did not meet the hype at all, didnt come close. But then the PCVR version came out and the game is actually good. I still wouldnt say that it reached the hype but I mean the hype was immense so that was understandable but it's a good fun game and it keeps you entertained. Of course the main aspect is the social interaction, it brings the world to life and makes you feel like a pokemon trainer set off on your adventure and you see other trainers out and about. But even going silent and focusing on my quests was fun and engaging. I give it a 4/5 because the game does have a bit of jank to it and there are some things they should add like moving mouths for the NPC's (etxemely immersion breaking and just annoying to look at) and improve the grip for sword wielders, because if you are holding a sword and it collides with an object, if you keep the motion your hand will continue but the sword will stay kinda floating where it collided, thats kinda immersion breaking in a sense and from what I imagine it should be an easy fix, since games like rec room, pavlov (&shack), echo vr, etc. dont have that physics issue. Other than that more polishing is always appreciated. But yeah good game, I enjoyed myself and will be playing more.",Jan 30 at 7:05 AM,4, 11,

Your game is entirely broken after this update! It keeps on crashing for like 2 to 3 minutes. I don't mind the bugs to be honest but this update definitely broke the game ! I am loving this to be honest and was invested in grinding stuff and participate to some events. But now, I can't even do that since it keeps on freezing for few minutes and the next time I know, I got disconnected.

2022-05-28 20:16:14.746826,OGMonoMan,Definitely still beta level game,"This game is certainly the start of a great game however there are a few things that can be improved.
1) The graphics on PC are a bit lackluster and there are certainly better looking games that perform just as well, i know this is designed to run on quest only as well but again i've seen better looking games.
2)The enemies are a bit dumb most of the time as they seem to lack much variation in attacks and they don't appear to ""Let other enemies know"" where a player is, swarm mechanics if you will.
3)Player combat is very simple and it lacks much depth beyond shooting and slashing other than pressing a button and moving your swords in one direction, perhaps some kind of combo sytem that requires the user to chain swing directions in a way that flows well.
4)Player charcters move very rigidly and it looks kind of dumb, especially when you see a bunch of people t-posing across the sky.
5)There are a few bugs of course.
6)There is a lack of a detailed narrative in the game, sure theres enemies that are doing stuff that you don't want them too but there doesn't yet seem to be an overarching story.
7)As a typical gamer i skipped the long reading tutorials and therefore missed a lot of crucial features that i later found through pure chance, maybe a bit more of a forced, guided tutorial that takes you through deeper aspects of play, while they may be annoying you miss them when there not there and don't know what your doing.
8)Music is very repetitive and could benefit from dynamic changes when in combat or chilling.

On to the good:
Travel feels good and natural but may benefit from a higher base stamina to make it less tedious.
Hitting enemies with swords feels good and it is rewarding when you can finally beat those enemies that have killed you many times.
Levelling and crafting are pretty good.
Social activity is always welcome.
And now I am out of space to write, if you get referal credit definitely try it and support the development because this has great potential.",Feb 24 at 4:59 AM,3, 2,

Original Review:
Quest 2 version is great and works as expected. But since this the rift store, one star because it is currently broken and you cannot log in on you PC to play. Will chang to 5 stars because it honestly deserves it as a game, but I cant do that if you cant even play it. And dont believe the 5 stars reviews. This is happeing to all Oculus PC users. They are jsut posting 5 stars because the game they have been waiting for the pst year has finally come out. The error you will get with your pc is ""Internet Connection Available: internet connection available, checking account...."". That litterally how it has been since launch. There are work around, like Virtual Desktop that works no problem, but this review is on the game and only game. Once the devs fix the game to work as intened, will change to 5 stars because it is actually worthy of it. But in my view, if you cant play it nativly  as intended without workarounds, it doest even derserve 1 star, thats a big fat ""F"" in my book.. That the honest truth! Im not a fanboy like all the 5 starers....",Feb 18 at 8:55 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:16:14.809658,siproguy,A true VRMMO,"First off, the game is amazing. The community has been really helpful, and it's fun to see little groups of people wander off and do their own thing. 

Graphics on standalone are pretty good, but with pcvr it's almost like a whole new game. Gameplay, A++ for both classes. The mage class is to me a mix of a shooter and mage in the same class. The blademaster is more up my alley as i've always played rogues or warriors in other MMO's. 

The hidden ""tears"" you can find and the ways you have to aquire them are a fun challenge, the ziplines add an extra level of excitement and while the crafting is simple, it does leave to be desired.

All in all, for the small team that put this together I am very impressed. Their milestones for this year are pretty big, i'll be excited to see if they can pull everything off that they want to.

That game just came out and already could need a big big Content Update..

2022-05-28 20:16:17.955887,Reqteq,Brilliant,"First off, this is my first VRMMO and let me say it pretty much checks all the boxes of an RPG. Only problem I have from the RPGing element.. is the main quest doesn't flow it just feels like go to A and kill B amount of this enemy/collect C items. Granted I am only level 10 so maybe there is more to it. I have witnessed numerous mmo launched and expansion launches so I expect minor bug/issues as with any live service game and expect they will be fixed so I wont talk about those. 
My biggest problem with the game and I hope either the devs are receptive to feedback or have in the works some UI changes. The weapons being in bubbles is not what I would expect from a VR experience. I would like to see maybe holsters for the mage pew pews and shoulder/backpack for swords etc so that when I am trying to pick up a herb, I dont get my screen blocked by weapons. Same with items they should be on a belt for more immersion. The block mechanic on the blade master although functional breaks immersion as well to me, I would have liked to maybe cross swords to block (you are using your body in VR make use of it.). 
Lastly, I think the charge system for weapon damage is fun but adding ""weight"" to weapons would make for a better experience. This can also prevent weapon spam like other games do, then you can have different weapons with different weights, if they decide to include 2 handed. Would make swings feel more impactful.
Overall a great experience and I look forward to how the game develops!",Feb 1 at 11:12 PM,4, 2,
2022-05-28 20:16:21.043239,Rapitor3131,A Solid Foundation for the best VRMMO,"Zenith is very much an unfinished game. With a small dev team it may be a while before things really start hitting their stride, but what is there already is amazing. The combat is simplistic, but fluid and feels amazing. The mobility is the best I've had in VR, gliding feels really fun and just exploring the massive teeming world is it's own treat. So far the only ""lifeskill"" is a cooking minigame, and much like the rest of the game, it's simple, yet super satisfying.

The price tag may seem a little steep for what is currently offered, but think of it as an investment for something truly great.

Just like some have stated.  It is a first step to a real MMO.  But open world, random quest and lack of a storyline really makes this another open world game for certain type of players to use as a social platform.  But the game itself isn't much special for now. By definition, it is a MMORPG.  As a matter of fact, I am feeling bored.  Graphics, control, storyline needs updates.  

I am stuck on making a decision whether or not to invest time to play now or wait until it is updated.  Not trying to critize.   But at its current status, there are many more games that are more interesting for me to utilize my time.  But yet, I don't want to shut it down right away.  

If I begin to invest time on this game, I may not enjoy it as much.  But it supposed to be a great idea to max my level before the updates.  I don't know.  Still struggling on what to do next for now.",Feb 11 at 9:45 AM,2, 0,

I logged in a tone of hours into VRchat, Pavlov, whatever you can think of. This game is unique; and as a player of MMO's like Final Fantasy XiV, This game is wonderful. Let me be clear, it isn't a perfect experience. But it is a good experience, and one that is definitely worth the price, considering the updates are free, new classes that are added are free, and there's a huge world to explore. Actual mechanics to your fighting make it feel fun and make you think instead of just flopping your wrists about (do I need to do powered AOE, Block, or Cadence single target?). Again, not a perfect experience by any stretch, and the game is still early access level, but It is definitely worth the investment, worth your time, and supporting the 15 devs that made it would do the game nothing but good, and an increase of support for an actual FUN mmo in VR would help more like it be a reality.",Feb 10 at 7:54 AM,4, 0,

No endgame is even in the game at launch, so dont worry about hitting 40 because when you do... you can go level a subclass but thats about it.

A very small thing that needs to be improved is that the map does not have enough information to progress properly in terms of the story.

Considering how AWFUL their data on demographics seems (the servers couldn't handle the D1 logins and crashed, all because they didn't do an open-beta despite many beta\alpha testers suggesting them that), I don't get it why there is such a preference for US over EU (especially after the launch hour which was EU peak (19:00 CET)).

If it wasn't that I have reasons that are outside the simple concept of ""having fun"" to get it, I would have waited until the game was better polished and, of course, more fair for both sides of player demographics (US vs Everyone else on the planet).

I can't find Naga, it was really hard to find ranged Sylphids, and Exiles. Can't find Ezrel aswell.

This game is BUGGY. As in, you will spent countless hours crashing and disconnecting from just about anything. Too many players on screen? Crash. Fast travelling to new area? Crash. Login to the game? Crash. Even when you're doing absolutely nothing, the game will crash. 

If you don't want to spend most of your time staring at the login screen, get this game when it's in a better state. You can see on their Discord that this problem is widespread, especially among Quest users. 

If you really want to play this game, I recommend getting the Steam PC version and play via Virtual Desktop (Airlink is unstable).",Feb 16 at 9:24 AM,3, 0,

The game is beautiful to explore, its massive to roam, and the combat is extremely fun. There are a huge amount of abilities and skills to learn, there's dungeons and different areas. You can cook, you can craft, you can shop. This is a true MMO experience worth putting time into, solo or with friends... But by far the open mic social experience is the best thing about it. I've had so many fun and funny moments with random people already. Amazing game!",Jan 28 at 8:06 PM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:17:08.571480,WhyKlef,This is it.,"I feel bad for another very popular VR MMO... No need to name it. But the artstyle was always such a turn off that I could never give it the time it deserved which is unfortunate as I'm sure it has an overall great world and fun times to be had.

But with Zenith, everything is coherent. The artstyle, the classes, the mechanics, the craftings, the quests, assets.

This game really has the potential to be a game changer. VR games before Zenith, and VR games after Zenith. I know it sounds exaggerated but this is a game that clearly can reshape standards from modern indie VR titles. Don't sleep on this one. Plus, at least for now, it doesn't seem to be plastered with kids running around screaming. 

I'm glad I got it and while I expected to play a week and then move to 2D Lost Ark, this game made me realize that I'll have to dedicate some time to this game too because I need to see what endgame will be like!",Jan 28 at 9:24 PM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:17:08.588435,Arkonios,Great VR MMO,I gotta say I'm really enjoying the game. The VR immersiveness brings the MMO experience up several notches. Loving how you have to do hand gestures to spells as a mage. The smooth locomotion in this game amazes me as well. This is the first game I've played where i haven't gotten cybersickness running.,Jan 28 at 11:29 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:17:08.605391,moveit124,I think its good.,"In my opinion this is the best MMO for VR hands down... however just cause its great for VR I dont think its finished enough.  Hopefully in the future their will be updates to add more things that fit within a MMO - a more fleshed out crafting system, cooking is fantastic I just think their needs to be other crafting options.  

The combat is ""meh"" - at first it seems really cool and interesting but its very simplistic and honestly its a detrament.  Most of my combat as a DPS Warrior is just Swipe down then slow swipe side to side until dead... blocking if I have stamina.  Mobs dont react to hits.  The abilities are shallow and lack depth.  There never is a BETTER time to use your abilities, its just spam them when they are up.  This is a huge problem in a MMORPG where you spend hours and hours grinding and killing things.  Their has to be nuance.

Questing system is super generic for a MMORPG.  Other than the flying quests its kill 10 of these, go to this location, collect 5 of those.  In VR we already know that Puzzles are AMAZING in VR.  Why cant we have some puzzle quests?  

Oh oh, and Mika and here 55 twins?  That needs to go - telling me to go to a SPECIFIC Mika back at a lake that I dont remember... with no markers on the map... is rediculous.  If you're gonna have 55 Mikas, atleast let me turn in my quests to any Mika not just a specific Mika at a specific location...

As far as performance - phenominal.  I am quite impressed by it, the fact that this can run so well on a standalone headset is insane.  And on PC it runs even better and looks better.  Well done.

There are bugs... which are to be expected.  Things like being able to get on top of the first ""dungeon"" and walk past the whole thing.  The inventory is a bit wonky, like equipping a sword always equips into the first slot instead of replacing the better version... and having to try and drag and drop.  I am sure this will all be fixed with time but just something to note.",Feb 1 at 4:18 AM,4, 1,
2022-05-28 20:17:08.622345,VinnyGunnz,So far so good,"I'm playing the Rift pcvr version on my Q2.   I've drained my battery twice playing it now, but I can already tell this is a vr game people will be talking about for some time.  It will basically be the benchmark for vr mmo's going forward.  At this point, it's very basic, but there is a lot to build on.  Already you can climb, swim, fly.  There is a lot to explore.  Originally I was skeptical and planned to just try it out for a couple hours and return it, but there is no way I would return this gem.  Even if you don't want to run around and do quests or events, you can just log in, wander around and kill stuff.  This game has soooo much potential going forward, but it's already fun and a worthwhile purchase.",Jan 31 at 12:58 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:17:11.707215,Shadow-Michae1,What an incredible experience,"I mainly play this on PCVR, and although the Quest 2 version is not as graphically appealing as the Desktop version, the gameplay and atmosphere and community more than makes up for it and it is just so much fun, no matter what you are doing! Whether you feel social or not, want to go around fighting or just walk (or glide/fly) around the world and explore, seeing everything unfold around you or with you in it, is always a hell of a lot of fun! Highly recommend and I cannot wait to see what more will come from this! This is just the beginning...",Jan 31 at 3:16 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:17:11.724169,Romeo_Belmont,"simple but good, with a few issues","there are two primary classes, 
-blade master-melee class (sword combat, very involved and very active)
-essance mage- range class (point and shoot magic wrist guns and magic AOE spells)
to be fair these cover alot of bases being that you can play any role dps,healer,and tank, with either class. the combat is smooth for the most part, and most of the controls are pretty straight foward, as in no jank gimmicky stuff that makes it feel akward.

if your playing on a quest 2 understand that once your headset heats up, you are going to get lag and tearing, its inevitable. but even then, the game holds up well and keeps you engauged enough to keep you wanting to play.

as of today 1/30/2022, most of the servers have a large population and you regularly see and play with other people. it is grindy, and repetative, but it's an mmo, thats to be expected.

things to know in advance
-as of today there doesnt seem to be a way to delete charecters, so make sure you have the name and charecter look you want before completeing your charecter, if you mess up, thats it, your stuck with it
-this is not a varied loot kind of game, most of the gear ive encountered looks the same, minus maybe some color diffrences, hopefully this will change but at the moment, thats what you get.
-i havent tested it yet, but supposedly there is a 2 charecter limit, keep that in mind when you pick names, or classes.

overall, im loving the game and id highly suggest it to everyone who likes mmo's.
if you can play with friends, that will always make games better, but even solo you can get by and have fun.",Jan 31 at 8:12 AM,4, 1,

2022-05-28 20:17:11.758080,RickySpanissh,"Didn't get into Orbus, i got into this !","First off, as many have pointed out, this game is unfinished. I played 3hrs of this and was very interested in more. I couldn't get past 3 hours of Orbus. Lots of players, most actually socialize too, that's always nice. Obviously will need more classes, more character custimization at creation.
 
Suggestions: 

1:Make menu pointers BRIGHTER. i lost them while navigating character selection and ingame menu.
2:Menu tooltips. small popup when highlighting a menu bar icon. great for new players.
3: Explain that when you change spec, your level start\resume where that spec left off. maybe a tooltip or small menu description.

as i play more i'll have more feedback.

Update after 10hours of play. I'm level 12.

More suggestions:

4: We need area\town names on the map. Qhen a quest says to go to this city\village\area, all we have are the light columns which don't always show (bug?)
5: Small quest name tooltip on map marker locations, at least for ""Story Quests"". Mika is everywhere and new players get lost and don't know which one to go to.  Or a different colored icon for ""completed"" quest turnin.
6:More explanations on Godstones and what to do with them. I figured out how to level them, but is there anything to do with the extras? Maybe add a feature to combine them?
7: Keep player level for all specs. Switching shouldn't drop you to lvl 1 (or current for that spec) Other games that allow spec changes, don't do this. Maybe do a 1 day cooldown or something to prevent constantly changing roles.

I'll update when i think of more.

A small start-up team poured years of their lives into making a quality VR MMORPG, but because of server issues - which was to be expected, anyway, and that's hardly unique to Zenith - some people gave the game a low score. Nothing to do with the experience while actually playing the game, you understand; the reviewers were briefly inconvenienced. (Many, no doubt, went on to enjoy the game.)

The game mechanics have huge potential and the game runs smoothly even when there's plenty of people around. Audio voice communications work well and locomotion feels satisfying. My biggest complaints at the moment are related to stuff that I think can be fixed easily: the initial loading screen starts in 3DOF but shows a floor, which makes some people feel motion sickness. The menus to register, start to play and choose server look ugly and they seem to be full of bugs. At the moment I can't play by Airlink or Oculus Link because the menu gets stuck at ""internet connection a available, loading something"" a nd the play button never appears.
