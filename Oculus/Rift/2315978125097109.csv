2022-05-28 18:52:39.127106,DeathkillerGod,Can NOT download!!!,"I don't know what happen. every time it hits 2.7GB, it just tell me to download it again?? I paid for it, but I can not play it.
Hope developer can fix it, otherwise I will have to ask for money back.","Oct 24, 2020 at 6:46 AM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 18:52:39.141068,Drawhen,Nice game but needs some improvements,"like: 
1.) - reduce the pushback of objects !
2.) - give it a teleport controll option !
3.) - implement hints which might reduce the overall score when used!","Sep 5, 2020 at 4:17 PM",4, 7,

2022-05-28 18:52:42.286654,Orphi81,"Wonderful, up until....",I've really enjoyed playing up until i got to Chapter Nine. I'm unable to interact with the colour buttons on the basement level.  I thought it was a glitch with my controllers but after restarting 4 times there seems to be no way to interact. :(  I'd really like to finish the game.,"Nov 24, 2019 at 9:50 AM",3, 8,"Hello Orphi81, will check it and upload a fix :-)"
2022-05-28 18:52:42.301615,Frodosw,Quite well done,"For the few VR games I've tried I've really enjoyed this so far. I do get some motion dizziness from the way you move around, but it's just a slight nuisance.  Some of the puzzles are really quite clever.","Dec 20, 2019 at 7:45 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:52:42.316574,Elgsdyr,Had to give up...,I really wanted to check this out but I had to give up because of motion sickness. I have no problems at all with smooth locomotion in other games like SkyrimVR but here the deadzone is pretty much non-existing so I find myself constantly drifting in some unexpected direction = instant nausea. Have not had this problem with any other game. Also there's an unusually large collision box around many objects and walls resulting in some uncomfortable push-back. It's a shame because the game seems interesting enough. Going to refund this...,"Oct 26, 2019 at 7:16 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 18:52:42.331534,themafo,Excelent puzzle game,"Lots of challenging puzzles. Some short levels and some long ones. The best Escape room game I've seen so far when I write this.

I still had some problems with the game as others mention too.
Some colors could be mixed and isn't easy to see the difference. Blue and purple, red and orange. The pushback from the walls and objects sometimes made me VR-sick. The room moves while I am not.

Highscores were interesting. But really miss to see them online on web somewhere. Objective scores doesn't seem to be correct calculated on all levels. But really fun anyway.","Sep 10, 2019 at 7:41 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 18:52:45.456177,RobinSHood,great puzzle game.,I really enjoyed playing the demo and just purchased the full game. The only improvement I would love to see is to be able to brighten the screen it is very hard for me to tell the diference between some colors. that makes me restart the game untill i can get a combination of colors i can see.  Would give it 5 stars for that.,"Aug 4, 2019 at 4:23 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 18:52:45.472134,LordDraco81,,"The game seems very good but the fact that the moves are not teleportation, gives me a bad heart. I tried twice to play but after less than ten minutes each time, I wanted to throw up. Is it possible to have the teleportation option for moving.","May 8, 2019 at 8:46 AM",1, 6,"Up to this momment Teleport isn't implemented, i will pass it to Development Team for future updates. Thank you for trying our game!"
2022-05-28 18:52:45.487095,Dracology,A fun little game but has a few issues.,"The issues mainly being lighting and vibrancy. The game uses color coding for certain puzzles but the dark enviroments and a lack of vibrancy on the clues have lead me to need to restart levels over and over till I get combos that are brighter in color or to just brute force a few locks. Looking at footage of the iOS version of the game this doesn't seem to be an issue there with the lighting being much simplier and the color clues being made to stand out clearly even in the brighter lighting.

It's a rare case where better graphics seem to actually hinder the gameplay by quite a bit, at least for me.","Apr 20, 2019 at 2:10 PM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 18:52:45.503052,rh_galaxy,Like the game,"Especially like the Global Scoreboards. Would be nice if you could find them on the website also. And miss the ability to restart a level without quitting the game.

The feeling is that the controls could be better, and I miss free rotation (now like 45 degree steps), also you often are moved back when you lean too far to check for items because the collision detection sees a wall but there is only a box on the floor or a drawer...

What I have seen so far there is no fear/horror involved, only puzzles and observant searching, but I see that as a plus.","Dec 22, 2018 at 10:48 PM",4, 13,Pushback effect has been greatly improved on new Version 1.10 . Thank you for commenting!
2022-05-28 18:52:45.519009,rsiggy,"Excellent graphics, interesting puzzles","Well done!  This game has classic escape room puzzles presented in a beautifully rendered environment. The puzzles weren't obvious but also weren't so hard that you want to just quit.  The Touch control scheme works well.  I particularly liked the inventory feature where you could see whats in your ""backpack"" by simply looking up until the backpack icon appears and then click on it.  You can also get to it with a Touch button but the look and point feature seemed much more elegant.  Global scoreboard is pretty cool but not sure it really means much as it looks like you can just replay the same level again and boost your score.  Anyway, I highly recommend this title for both the fantastic graphics and the interesting puzzle play.","Feb 2, 2019 at 11:46 PM",5, 3,"Each time you Start a Chapter, Items placement (Papers,Object,Keys,Gems)  & Passwords change, you can repeat each level in Higher Difficulty to achieve a better Score among other player Globally. Thank you for your kind words!"

Are there any Jumpscares?","Feb 24, 2019 at 2:57 AM",4, 1,"Escape Legacy apart from the mysterious enviroments and sound effects, doesn't have Jumpscare events, as it is focused on escape room experience.Thank you for commenting!"
