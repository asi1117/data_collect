2022-05-28 20:20:16.293705,cav800,Awful.. just absolutely awful.,"This game is so bad and highly buggy. Teleportation is wonky with it sometimes turning around to where you must teleport facing backwards first. The screen also flickers when you teleport. Blue lights bleed through the ceiling. Interacting with anything is incredibly frustrating because it takes numerous attempts to do so.  Most objects cannot be interacted with either. Opening doors is a total pain because the doors keep closing on you as you try to enter a room. Perhaps the biggest bug/problem with this game though is that when opening drawers, your hand will completely disappear. And the only fix for this is to quit the game and restart. Seeing as the puzzles demand you to open several drawers, this is a major issue. There are also no options, terrible anti-aliasing issues, and only a few rooms to explore that all look the same. I would not recommend this game to anyone.","Apr 8, 2021 at 7:14 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 20:20:16.315646,mishka11,Fun escape game but needs some polish,"Pro:  nice graphics, 5 rooms to explore, find cards throughout, puzzles. It would've been nice to have more interactives and puzzles ...since thats what escape gamers look for in this kind of game. But we like to support these kinds of game devs to encourage future releases.

Cons: Short (finished it in 30 min) and some glitches
- Hand kept disappearing and after some confusion, realized the hand will reappear when you use it to interact with objects. 
 - Like another review mentioned...the teleport is wonky. The forward doesnt come up unless you select backwards first. so lots of turning around until discovering how that worked.

Yes, it was short game, but I feel like i got my moneys worth. And Id consider updating the review to 4 stars if those glitches were corrected. Thanks","Nov 2, 2020 at 10:54 PM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 20:20:16.345566,FeverishPegasus,"Fun, but short","The puzzles are decently fun, sort of what you'd expect for any escape room experience, but the six cards do not take very long to find. I was in and out of the game within about an hour. It was not all that clear I had beaten the game either once I'd gathered everything and left the house.

The controls need a bit of work. I'm right handed, and usually I expect the teleport controls to be on my left hand (with rotation on the right hand), but they were flipped. It would be nice to have the option to configure this. The teleport was also kind of finnicky, I had to press right on my thumbstick first to activate the teleport pointer, but to make sure I was facing the right way, I had to quickly rotate the stick forward in the split second it gives me before the teleport activates.","Oct 12, 2020 at 8:28 AM",3, 0,
