I search the web to find a solution and a lot of people with recent cards has the same problem. But there's no known solution so don't buy this game if you have a recent rig.

2022-05-28 11:37:33.594016,Manttipaa,Interesting story and visuals,"Gameplay is good. Sometimes felt a bit bored to certain game mechanics. Puzzle and navigation are the main elements where this game focuses on. Story and characters are very interesting. 

Some bugs related to the start of the session. Sometimes starting a new session causes the game to crash when doing certain action:
- Solution is to reset the character by killing it",Mar 29 at 7:38 AM,4, 5,
2022-05-28 11:37:33.608976,Motomcmonk,BUY THIS GAME.,"This game is by far my favorite VR title. The story is engaging, the dialogue is witty but not campy, the mechanic and movement make for a pace that constantly felt personally adjusted to my needs. I recommend air-linking and playing from a spinny office chair for maximum immersion. (It helped with the floaty feeling) I can't wait to start the second one.",Feb 2 at 12:18 PM,5, 56,

My pc is pretty garbage, but with finely dialed graphic settings this was running at good fps and decent graphics, I will replay this after upgrading my pc and will  play Lone Echo II only after upgrading. This also makes me respect the multiplayer spinoff even more.",Feb 19 at 12:19 PM,5, 22,

2022-05-28 11:37:33.653856,becca.p.1996,Amazing VR experience,"I first played this game at my university where they had a VR lab for students to try out. This game was on there and I had so much fun, but wished I had an Oculus of my own to really fully take my time and explore everything! A year or two later, I finally saved up for an Oculus and this was the first game I got when I got my headset! Amazing and immersive and the story was really good for such a short game! Also everything Troy Baker is in always seems to turn out amazing, though I was surprised to see his name in the credits! I knew I had recognized Jack's voice but due to his ""robot"" voice I couldn't place it until the end. Love this game to bits and you really get invested in the story, especially the relationship between Jack and Liv! 10/10 would recommend!",Jan 22 at 8:30 AM,5, 27,

Have tried using the alternate save files, got past previous points, but always after about 15-30 mins it crashes. Both in airlink and virtual desktop. Uninstalled for the final time, played through the start so many times that the game has lost all allure for me. Too late to get a refund and wont be buying the sequel.",Mar 8 at 6:54 AM,1, 3,

2022-05-28 11:37:36.792081,StormChronicles,Best buy ever,"It's the best game there is on the Meta Quest in my opinion. Also for the second part Lone Echo 2.
Great storytelling, beautiful graphics.
The controls are magnificent, it feels very natural.
In space no one can here you scream",Mar 21 at 8:38 PM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 11:37:36.806548,Inseino,Best VR game I've played yet,"I'll admit I haven't played Half Life Alyx yet, and wanted to play this before Lone Echo 2. Running with a RTX 2070 and a crappy router which caused the odd stutter and I had to dumb down graphics a bit to smooth it out, was worth playing it wirelessly. I can't imagine playing this any other way except spinning around in an office chair while you float about. 

No motion sickness for me with the zero g. It was a pleasant surprise actually how natural the environment felt. Amazing quality and I believe the game is 4 years old now so just wow. 

Don't even think about it. Wait for a sale if you like. I usually do but from the reviews I paid full price for this and do not regret a cent.

Definitely going to get a better router when I buy and attempt to play Lone Echo 2. Would love to do wireless again. But I do not want to sacrifice graphics too much so if the new router doesn't improve things enough, I'll finally setup a ceiling rig for my link cable. Don't plan on a GPU upgrade any time soon. Just need to be able to spin spin spin 360 degrees to play this game right.",Nov 26 at 12:39 PM,5, 84,

I also lose all audio within my Rift headset itself. I have to close down the game and the oculus app itself to get sound back. I've uninstalled Lone Echo, Oculus, ALL my VR games and content, wiped everything clean and started from scratch, downloaded different save-game files online, and nothing helps. Right around the time you're doing your first EVA the audio just stops. I so desperately want to play this game so I can buy the sequel but I can't even play it.

2022-05-28 11:37:46.259134,Capt.Okami,Painfully Disappointing,"I bought this game after reading some stellar reviews, but was very disappointed.  The story is unengaging and subpar, the gameplay was just painful, literally several hours of being a robot without usable legs mucking about in space fixing one thing after another until the very end.  It's nearly impossible to play this game sitting down because you need to be able to turn around, but you can't really walk around either, you just stand in one spot turning around doing stuff with your hands and trying to use the most uncomforable VR interface of any game i've played to date.  Graphics are about par for 2005.  Story is entirely predictable and cringeworthy.  I wish I could give a list of pros, but there weren't many.  The only one is that there weren't too many bugs in it.",Jan 12 at 7:22 AM,1, 4,

unfortunately, considering this came out a few years ago I'm a little disappointed in some of the issues I had encountered.
first the ""couldn't install lone echo"" (that eventually got fixed) almost had me refunding the game before I could even play it
and then a few game breaking bugs that caused me to have to reload an earlier save file and hope that the bug resolved. most notable one I had was at the ending [potential spoilers] when a certain scripted line of dialogue and a certain chair movement didn't trigger and had me stuck for a while.

Hat-tip to the reviewer who recommended playing this wirelessly via air link while sat on a spinning office chair, it made moving around in microgravity feel so immersive. grab on to a handhold with one hand, spin the chair as you move around to face the way you want to move, it adds so much!",Mar 31 at 12:54 AM,5, 0,

Update: I upgraded to a 3080 ti and the crashing stopped. So guessing it must have been some sort of vram limitation?

Great story. Would have given it a full 5 star review except I got stuck twice, each time for about an hour before looking it up. Other than a slightly more intuitive design on some levels, this was a great game with an interesting narrative.

For a game that's 4yo, it still sets the bar high on how a VR experience should be from the visuals, story, and interactivity of the Zero G  environment.

Felt genuine anxiety in parts where I started drifting away from the ships and land marks in the game.  The way that you move around is genius - zero gravity works very well in VR cause you can just grab anything and propel yourself.  The story line is well done and a joy to experience.  

My only complaint is lack of a quick save option.  Hard to tell when the game has been saved.  When you get VR fatigue you should be able to exit the game without losing any progress.  I don't like the way this game makes you torture yourself to get to a checkpoint when you just need a break from VR.",Mar 10 at 6:50 AM,4, 0,

2022-05-28 11:38:05.221619,KosmonavtTomas,Easily a must play for any VR user,"Along with Half-Life: Alyx, Lone Echo is the best VR game right now. What impresses me the most is how well Lone Echo holds up, because so far the VR industry moves so fast that some games are aging poorly after only three or four years (see Arizona Sunshine for example).

But Lone Echo is not one of those games. It still looks darn good, sounds darn good and, most importantly, feels darn good. I cannot think of any other VR game with a comparable satisfying level of movement. Flying through space, grabbing anything to push off and the inertia mechanics are exceptional.

The story is great too. It is pretty simple on its own but the dialogues, actor performances and the atmosphere of some kind of grounded sci-fi are elevating the whole experience to a very high level. As a bonus, this is the only AAA VR game that comes to my mind where you can interact with an actual human character for so long and for that close. It feels like a very impressive effort development-wise.

I have high hopes for Lone Echo II but even if it'll be more of the same, it'll be amazing.",Oct 11 at 4:37 AM,5, 5,

- Strong performances? Check.
- Atmospheric? Check.
- Immersion? Check.
- Get your money’s worth? CHECK!
- Superlative graphics beyond anything else

With what they can do now on newer GPUs, I am expecting nothing less than stunning graphical imagery, alongside a strong story.

This original is still better than 99% of anything you’re going to find out there in terms of getting your money’s worth, because it lasts longer than 45 minutes of interest or completion.

2022-05-28 11:38:11.490142,CasualCheetah,Good Stuff! Don't Sleep on Lone Echo!,"To think I was sleeping on this brilliant game for over four years. Lone Echo is larger and more polished than I had once reluctantly assumed. It's just as high-profile and captivating as Oculus's other forty-dollar titles. 

Primarily, it's a space maintenance game with a lot of gratifying levers and mini-puzzles. However, the heart of Lone Echo is the wonderful narrative and dialogue between Jack and Liv. The lonelier portions of the game are a stark contrast from other chapters, but they remain exceedingly immersive. Zero-G is a great fit for VR locomotion. Being weightless in game mirrors the limited physical feedback we get from a VR headset. The inverse-kinematics on Jack's body are spot on. It really sells your physical presence in a world without gravity. Much of the game seems as if it would have been ahead of its time in 2017. Also, the relative age of the game means it runs admirably well on my aging PC.

It was great to finally get around to playing Lone Echo and I can't wait to see what the highly anticipated sequel has in store.",Oct 8 at 7:15 AM,5, 3,

Graphics: Nvidia GeForce Rtx 3060

Wow this game just looks beautiful all around! and it super smooth using AirLink with my quest 2! There was zero latency and I didn’t even have to run Virtual Desktop. 

The Game:
Play as Echo 1, an assistant to Captain Rhodes aboard the ship space station orbiting Saturn. The story is immersive! It will leave you not wanting to take a break, the suspense will leave you wanting to play to more the story is so intrigue and the cinematic gameplay is just so well played, you really feel like your in space! The game really using physics when picking up objects in the game or even holding on to the ship while transporting through outer part of the ship.

Cons:
Understandably (for me that is) the game is a few years old, tasks in the game that involve picking up objects and placing them inside or around things doesn’t exactly look play well. Arms will flip and flop and Echo 1 will sometimes even launch backwards if an objects is misplaced while putting it inside something. This is something that will probably and most likely be improved in LE2.

Just buy the dam game!

2022-05-28 11:38:17.784516,LonArt,Great Game!,"I bought this title and was originally disappointed because there were no subtitles available. (Which I rely upon)  This is a very story rich game, so not being able to hear what was being said kept me from enjoying this.  

Recently I discovered a 3rd party app that made it possible to add in subtitles so excitedly jumped right in, and I'm so glad I did!

A great storyline, excellent voice acting, provided by Troy Baker and Alice Coulthard and absolutely beautiful visuals make this one of my favorite VR games of all time, ranking up there with Half-life ALyx. ( though much shorter than that excellent title).

This game challenges you in ways that most games cannot.  Just getting around is a pleasure and a challenge. Traversing dark, alien organism infested corridors where merely bumping into them means you are wrapped in parasitic tendrils and ""die"" made for some heart pounding moments.

Though I have my ""VR Legs"" I was still worried that moving in Zero G would create Simulation sickness for me, but movement is handled so well that I felt no discomfort whatsoever.  Well done to the dev team!  

The superb writing and voice acting really made me care about the few characters in this game.  I laughed at the subtle humor and genuinely liked Olivia Rhodes and an AI character that comes later in the story.  The heart pounding ending while satisfying made me want much more and leaves the door wide open for the sequel.

2022-05-28 11:38:20.916292,thelevyisdry,Lone echo,"Gameplay:
Let me start by saying lone echo is a game. Don't the let cinematic nature of the game fool you, this is no ""experience"" it's not an ""interactive movie"" either this is a GAME. This is both good and bad, because for the good, it means there is plenty of gameplay and puzzles to complete, you don't just stand there, you get to play. But for the bad, some moments that should be emotional and immersive are broken up by overly ""gamey"" interactions. I won't give any spoilers, but some really intense stuff has immersion breaking gameplay attached to it that gives it less of a gut punch when you have to, for an example, burn holes in ui panels for some reason during a really heavy part, like, how bout we just let the story do it's thing here? Good news though, is that these interactions are almost all satisfying and not usually immersion breaking, with the exception of that dang hand laser. The interactions with said laser go like this: press button to activate laser, cut away painfully obviously marked area of metal, put laser away. Oh yeah and do that again 1000 times. The worst part, is that when you cut, it uses these system where you cut away little cubes of it like this is Minecraft or something. For how classy and high production value the rest of these parts are I don't know why they decided to do it this way. It's just a little gripe, but for how polished the rest of the game is, this feels oddly out of place, and in turn breaks immersion. Gameplay is good, not perfect. Oh yeah also being able to grab everything and float in zero g is spot on, and I recommend not play echo arena if you plan on playing this because it will seem all the more magical. Also every interaction between you and Olivia is great, and the dialogue method here is perfection.

Graphics:
I played this game on oculus quest 2 via ""real"" link (cable) with a 1600 af and Rx 580(8gb) (basically gtx 1060). It ran just fine on medium settings with resolution in the oculus software at recommended, and the res in game set to (1.0). Even with my lower end pc, I was still incredibly immersed in most parts and had effective 0 issues with it. I didn't measure to see how many frames were being dropped, but it only seemed to dip when looking at very large, open areas with lost of little details. From a distance the game looked kinda fuzzy (if you have better gpu set the in game settings to res: 2.0) then this will be a non-issue. Up close interactions looked amazing though, taking to characters, picking up objects, and waving at my shadow, which i spent a concerning amount of time doing. Overall, graphics are top notch, on my system this game plates comparible to elite dangerous, and much better than stormland.  

Story:
Now this is the highlight isn't it. The story here is good, I won't lie. This is the first game in years that has got me to feel, sad, happy, scared, and lonely all at the right times, and all like it was really happening. You really do form a bond with the main character and towards the end I really felt concerned for her as though she were real. It's a little scary to think a bond like this can be formed with something completely fake, on a level far beyond that of any movie or tv show I've seen. Vr is really the future of storytelling, and this is the best example of a story in vr (I've played so far). Some parts are so immersive and felt my pulse pounding, and had to remind myself to stay calm, in a game. Wack. 
Overview:
While it's not fine work of art, and has a few kinks here and there, some moments border or spiritual because of just how immerse you become. Can't wait for 2. For those wondering it's about 5 hours long, but is probably the best 40$ you can spend in vr, so buy it.",Jul 14 at 7:54 AM,4, 65,

I wanted more, and was curious what is next... Will buy Lone Echo 2.

2022-05-28 11:38:20.965162,MartienAnonyme,"Definitely a must-have, but with caveat","My score translates into 5 stars but is actually a 4.7

The only reason being that the “dialogue” button to be pressed near objects of interest is absolutely not a natural thing to do and can stuck you at various moments, there are some bugs with some objectives points that keep appearing in A/R although not any longer relevant (so you waste a lot of time getting back and forth in hoping to progress), and other bad game mechanic design choice (or glitch?) with some robots arms or legs assembly which is absolutely not logical.

But overall, this has to be one of the most immersive VR game available even in 2021, with incredible graphics (I never saw an NPC more convincing than Liv!) and a sense of scale that I found nowhere in any other title.

So a must have and play of course, without any doubt.

Traversal was fun, and the game overall VERY immersive. The UI is one of the most unique and intuitive I've ever used, and best by a mile in VR so far. It wasn't a particularly challenging game but I did feel most of the parts I got stuck/died on were kind of cheesey and annoying and just retracted from the overall experience rather than have any sort of impact. The ending wasn't really a big cliffhanger, so I'm unsure where LE2 will go with the story... but it was a satisfying enough ending.

i had initially bought this game a few months ago and got a refund. saw the price go down and decided to give it another chance as lone echo 2 was announced.

Now understand that this game doesn´t have any jumpscares or monsters but still the whole atmosphere makes you uncomfortable and intense as hell ! .. Storywise well this is all just a big setup to something great what will probably happen in Lone Echo 2, but i can tell you i had strong connection to Captain Rhodes.

Graphically it was amazing compared to some other VR games, crashed only once and was going stable 60 fps .. so overall i´m giving it 4/5 it´s amazing game but as i said it´s a setup for something greater, if you want to experience Dead Space without monsters definitely try this",Jul 24 at 7:21 PM,4, 3,

Also not having subtitles in the game that consists of dialogues by roughly 50%, while having already implemented parts of the UI that float around you, makes no sense to me.

I may be baised because I am not a fan of horror or jump scares, I'm not really trying to spoil, but this is not much of a horror game. No alien jumps out at you in the dark, although, the game does try to scare you by making you go through drak tunnels and solve puzzels whilst in danger, which only adds to the thrill. 15/10 Review.

I cannot believe this is a 2017 game, and yet it nails so many of the VR mechanics.    So many titles released even this year (2021) simply can't seem to get VR right like this game does.  Allow me to name just a few that really pleased me:

-  Full IK for arms
-  Full grab mechanics on items
-  Wonderful use of VR for grabing, scanning, etc.

On top of that, the game looks great and just controls really well.  The voice acting is excellent and there's just a level of polish in this game that you struggle to find in VR these days.  I picked this up on sale, but wish I'd payed full price just to support the developers.

If I have a nitpick it's that the story so far is a little boring.  I'm about an hour in and I've just helped restore some downed eqiupment on the ship.  I'd like a little more action and mystery.  So while the VR mechanics are excellent, and the immersion is great, I'd love to see a bit more sense of mystery, exploration, and maybe some combat.",Oct 3 at 4:25 AM,5, 0,

I wish I knew exactly what was up with this game, and why I had issues playing it (read the original review below), but it's working again, so I guess I should be happy about that.

So far, this game is great, Manuvering space is so cool, and the game runs quite well, even over the new AirLink for the Quest 2

-- Original --
The first few minutes are pretty cool, but I want to experience more. However, I can't get past an issue where the game crashes when trying to use the reactive cutter for the first time. Attempting to use it crashes the game. Happens every time without fail. Re-installing did not help.

If it gets fixed, or something makes it start working again and I actually get to play this game, I'll change the review. Unfortunately, it's completely unplayable as I cannot progress","May 13, 2021 at 5:24 AM",4, 3,"Hey there, sorry to hear you keep having this issue.

Well actually like 40 years since sitting in front of my TI/99 knowing one day games like this would be possible.  Being possible and making something with it are two different things.  This is apparent at the amount of less then quality titles for VR.
This game though, the way you can grab onto the environment and realistically push off in zero-G.  I love the little details like while gripping a surface and rotating your ""hand"" it adjusts accordingly, or does it's best.  Something I've still yet to see in any other VR title.  Plus looking at your hands and actually being a robot...I mean c'mon.  How cool can you get. 
Heading ""outside"" for the first time...my first time I actually just hung out for about 1/2 hour no joke.  Just floating above Saturns rings (not really a spoiler IMO).

When I first started the game, I was amazed at the imersive experence, and was able to fly through the game pretty fast. It's ablsoultely stunning. It quickly became my top five favorite VR games of all time. Out of 10 I would have given it a 35. Then I ran into the putsy, and incredibly frustrating ""alien tunnels"" that grab you if you touch them.  The ""Biomasses"" I run into after reparing the AI in the ship are ridiculous. The openings are so small and tiny to fit through, I quickly forgot how awesome the game was and quickly became frustrated and pissed off. I just haven't been able to get through the trunnels. I love an immersive expreience, and took in all the graphics and gameplay. But again, the tunnles are a little overkill. I've tried over 30 times to get through them and haven't been able to. I've watched walkthroughs and tutorials, and still cannot get through it. I'm not wasting anymore of my time with this game. I wish I could get my money back, but am not able to. I was so looking forward to the sequel, but will not be purchasing that either. It's a shame. For the kind of gamer I am, on all different platforms, this was actualy taking the top spot of all games on all platforms I've played in my lifetime. Such a shame. I'm giving it one star, which is harsh, however I've lost my patience with this crap. Plus the shooting the ""spores"" with your cutter is unnecessary and creates a distraction that isn't needed. Even if I do end up getting through them, it's completely ruined the expreience.","May 18, 2021 at 6:44 AM",1, 1,

As a fan of Sci Fi the feeling of using the bars to push yourself through coridoors alone makes this game so immersive. Thern having toold such as your scanner and welding tool to fix generators, comms arrays and being thrown into these puzzles makes you feel like your on qa space station. 

The game released in 2017 and being fairly new to VR (getting my Rift S last year 2020) i got my VR legs playing games such as Alyx and boneworks, Lone Echo stands proud at the same quality as then. 

I would say the games priorites are Immersion, Storyline then game play. That doesnt mean that the game isnt fun, the last quarter of the game in my opinion started to get a little repetative on the taks but the sense of urgency and pace of the expierence makes it all worth it. 

In conclusion - It is a great expierence all together, The immersion for me was almost next level. The play time for me was around 6 hours but i feel like i will dive into it again and would encourage my friends to try it too. If you are a fan of Sci-Fi or just need a VR game to enjoy without time pressure then give this a try!!

I've had a PSVR which I enjoyed but I've always wanted to play Lone Echo and decided to get a Quest 2. As someone who enjoys Sci Fi this is an amazing experience from start to finish. It has a great story which keeps you invested and moving forward, the environments are detailed and reasonably varied within the scope of the game and there are actions to accomplish so your actually playing a game as opposed to watching an interactive movie. I tested the game with both Oculus Link and Virtual Desktop and could not tell the difference between the two so played the whole game via Virtual Desktop as being completely wireless was definitely preferable. If you have a PC capable of running Lone Echo and enjoy a story driven sci fi adventure I would recommend this to anyone.","Dec 16, 2020 at 5:47 PM",5, 221,

I felt there was an artificial bond between me as a robot/AI and the captain Olivia Rhodes and I start really want to help her if she is in need of, as the story progresses. Storywise it's not like a super complex space tale, and that's the appeal here, as it feels very genuine in all aspects. The graphic quality support this even further, with very good character models, the facial expression is still the best in VR .
Lone Echo and Half Life Alyx are the shining examples of how VR games should be. Grand, immersive and beautiful with full of love to details, because details are nowhere so important than it is in VR.

The last third of the game has you avoiding Spuds that take over the corridors of another space station.  You test your skills from all that you have learned floating  around the space station.  If you touch the spores they consume you.

Pros,
excellent graphics
game mechanics
game immersion is too real
Puzzles had the right amount of difficulty.  Anymore and it would have been too discouraging on my part.

Cons,
not really a con, but, the story line was a bit on the short side.

I have NEVER felt a connection to a non-player character as I did in Lone Echo. It surprised me, but it was the first time in any game I felt the NPC I was with wasn't hollow or predictable. From the jokes, asking her about her history from the objects around that show her humanity while on a space station. Caring about her character (like in a good book) makes the connection to the game much more. This is why I consider it one of the best overall game and experience (VR or not), use of mechanics and atmospherics (specificalyl for VR, even for a few years old still is amazing).

Since I could not go to an earlier save point I am effectively stuck where I am unless I was to start the whole game again and hope the same glitch won't happen again.

It is very frustrating to encounter a bug like this even when it has been out for years and should have been sorted. Unfortunately I cannot get a refund because I played it for more than 30 minutes.

The end is all about micro moves and trying to maneuver around tiny floating things, rather than the style of the rest of the game and solving puzzles.

I wanted to see a cool ending to the whole thing, but it just ended without much of anything. The whole experience is the game itself. Don't expect a grand fanally ending because you won't get it.  If you aren't enjoying playing the game just stop playing because it won't get any better. I'm glad I got this on a black friday deal because otherwise I would be disappointed.

I didnt know what to expect when I first bought this game yet even the lack of shooting and killing which I love about most first person games still didnt take away from the great gameplay that was Lone echo. Although it does take a little while to get your space legs in this game you soon learn how to navigate around zero G and stop and gaze in awe at the graphics of the ship your on and even the view of Saturn. The graphics would have to be the games strongest strength but the game play which involves doing astronaut sort stuff makes for a fun ride. I feel the game length was just right as not to start doing the same astronuat activities over and over again. I didnt notice any bugs during the game except perhaps a purple sphere which surronds you as you ride on one of the space crafts known as furies. That still didnt detract away from the game in anyway shape or form.

Man where do I start. I spent an entire day, over 8+ hours, going through the main story (I didn't feel like hunting down the optional collectables because the map is BIG) and I didnt even realize it had been that long I was so immersed into the character I was playing.

The visuals in this game are stunning. The movement of Zero Gravity is perfectly translated into VR in a smooth and comfortable way. The quips here and there with the dialoge choice system is done fantasticly and gives the main character some personality that a lot of VR titles are missing. The main story is great to experience. 
This is one of the first VR games that has actualy felt like i just played through an actual game with a fully fleshed story and not just a fancy tech demo showing what VR is capable of, void of any real substance.

The only, ONLY real complaint I have, is the lack of subtitles. Thats it. I just would have liked some form of subtitles and this game would be a perfect 10/10.

The way you move around is really cool and I prefer it from the standard teleport way of moving in VR. Although that is only possible and makes sense as it is set at a zero gravity environment. If you are new to VR you may not want to start with this game as it does takes some time to get used to it. However, if you are a fast learner and you like a bit of a challenge then go for it. The graphics and lighting is very realistic so you will not be dissapointed if you are looking for good graphics. The story is also very engaging and you will not be bored. This is NOT another VR shooting game - thank god ! Shooting at things is not the only way to have fun in VR. I hope developers focus more in creating immersive experiences rather than a point an shoot game so many are focusing on. Not everyone likes violence.

I am ashamed to admit that I didn't give it the time back then, as this is an utterly incredible, captivating experience which absolutely holds up and surpasses most games, VR or otherwise, even today; well and truly ahead of its time.

The graphics, controls, mechanics and story are almost flawless, minus the ever so few janky physics glitches or the slightly drawn out last third of the story, but make no mistake, this is a milestone achievement for VR and represents the standard by which other VR titles should aspire to.

For the first time ever I lost time in VR. It was blue skies and sunny when I went in, and night when I came out. Never for me has a VR game been so completely captivating.

This is an essential VR title for ALL VR users. If you don't have it yet, it's absolutely worth the full asking price, but if it appears on a sale don't hesitate for a second.","Aug 2, 2020 at 5:30 AM",5, 1,

Once you get into outer space the slow movement and constant deaths by radiation offset some of the joy of floating through space.

One of the strongest parts of the game is the experience of building companionship with your partner. It's a dynamic that few VR or Non-VR have been able to nail as well as Lone Echo.","Jul 15, 2020 at 5:29 AM",4, 2,

I have a solid 3 hours in the game and this is one of the most immersive vr experiences to this date. I found it funny when I went out into space my laptop couldn't handle it. It's not the developers fault for me not having the recommended specs for the game, but it shows how much they put into the game. So much so that it made me lag. I would compare your specs to the recommended specs to be certain before buying.

Sidenote, to get the best experience. I would recommend setting up your sensors for 360 degree tracking. I preferred turning in real life over using the joystick. It's way better and more immersive that way, trust me.

In conclusion; Great game, very minor flaws, one of the most immersive titles out there. Must buy.

Edit: I just finished the game. What I said still stands and it holds up very well for today's standards. Even with lower than recommended specs, the ""low quality"" graphics look so great. I had one bug which if i said it would spoil the game if you haven't played it. So I'll just say the bug didn't let me progress and I had to exit to menu and go back to my last save point. After that I got past it and finished the game. This most likely wont happen to you but if the game wont let you progress for some reason just go to the menu and go back. It'll go to your last save point and you'll be fine.

So why only 4 stars?  Well I was outside the space station and I went back to the station and just as I got there everything crashed...  I don't mean by the anomaly I mean the program itself.

Ok so just re-run it and continue... but it lost the saves and wanted me to restart all over again from the very beginning.

That is why the 4 stars... who wants to go through all of that again?

2022-05-28 11:41:28.343325,Thraze,Hope for the future of VR,"So many VR games are really just showcases of VR technology that lack any real soul. Don't get me wrong, I LOOOVE hacking people up in Blade & Sorcery and I still play it all the time, but VR as a medium should be the closest we get to true immersion, and games like Beat Saber and B&S just don't really go that deep. I've been losing faith in the VR industry for this reason, but Lost Echo has provided hope for the future. I've never been so immersed in a video game. Never truly lost myself so much in a story and character. Jack provided all of that and more. I was no longer just a dude swinging my arms around with a headset on my face. I was floating in space, repairing satellites and space ships, bouncing around in Zero G, cracking wise with my human counterpart, tapping the side of my head to activate my flashlight and traverse dark tunnels and asteroids. THIS is the VR experience I've always wanted. THIS is the reason I bought a VR headset so long ago. I can't believe I only discovered it a couple of days ago. I truly hope the future of VR is more Lost Echo and less Gorn. I can't wait to play through again once I update my graphics card! I played on a 970 so I knew it wouldn't be gorgeous, but even on low settings, I was stunned.","Feb 26, 2020 at 4:59 AM",5, 112,"Hey there, thanks for taking the time to share your honest feedback with us.

The problem:  everythig you have to do requires an NPC to tell you to do it.  The problem is, sometimes the cue just never comes.  Since you can't do things except in a specific order, once you get to one of these unspoken cues, the rest of the game is unreachable.  I was able to get most of the garden going again but being unable to get a cue to open the panel, I have no idea what the rest of the game is like.

Still, it was really cool up to that point.  Having done the garden two dozen times now wishing I could open the panel, guess I just got ripped off on this one.  :-(","May 20, 2020 at 9:59 AM",2, 4,

I was also not sure if I wanted to buy this or not, as I suffer from slight Motion sickness from games like Boneworks and other like this. However I played for hours and didn't feel ill at all. (I DO RECOMMEND PLAY ECHO VR FIRST TO TEST YOUR VR SPACE-LEGS)

This is a really pretty game compared to other VR games/experiences (especially considering its age). 

The story is fairly interesting, but the characters are really well written/acted and interesting. I definitely felt emotionally invested towards the end. 

The game play is smooth but I occasionally found myself in a position were I wasn't sure what to do next. I didn't bother picking up collectibles as a result and I don't think I'd go back for another playthrough. 

It's a little slow for me in places, but it works for the setting and it's very enjoyable if you can get into the right mindset.

Wow! I finished the game in 4 days and loved every minute of it. I am already halfway through my second play through and found some nice easter eggs and took the time to finish the Comsat mission. I often just look around while floating in space and simply cannot believe how I feel like I am really there in an astroid field next to Saturn. This game has made so many of my dreams feel like they are coming true.

I played LE with my older Quest1 mostly wireless with the use of Virtual Desktop (VD). The graphics and performance are mostly good with graphics being a little fuzzy when I am in motion or only fuzzy off in the distance when I stand still. However when I play wired with a normal cable, the graphics and performance is outstanding no matter if moving or not.

My PC specs are:
i7-6700K CPU @ 4.0 GHz (8 cpus), 16gb ram
Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 8gb vram

Great graphics.

Real connection to the characters.
Mechanics are simple but done perfect.

I didn't buy this game for a while i just got it ive had vr for about 1.5/2 years now and decided to get the game as there is a LOT of hype around it and the new one coming. I'm happy that i bought it, now i know why there is so much hype around it. You get a real connection to the characters i have not had a game like that since Telltale the walking dead series. The zero g flying around is great!
It's if titanfall turned into a vr game.

The only reason i didn't put a 5 star is because of the price.. It's a two year old game i would have been a lot happier if the game was a little cheaper maybe £20/25.

With so many gimmicky games out there, its no wonder VR hasn't taken off the way we expected it to. However, if just a few more games of this quality are released, I think VR will take over as the next gaming medium. This is truly a triple A title that rivals all of the current games out now, 2 years later.

Lone Echo is extremely immersive down to every little scratch and worn edge of the environment. The concept of embodying a sentient robot to help your human companion through space survival is both exhilarating and existential. The plot is really good and you feel a real bond with your human counterpart, Olivia.

The puzzles are just challenging enough to keep you engaged without beeing overly frustrating and the environment is inexplicably beautiful! 

Seriously, if you have the hardware to run it, just buy it!!! Like now! You won't be disappointed!

2022-05-28 11:41:41.116073,vrwabbit,Top Notch Game But Low Audio Levels,"Lone Echo is by far the best VR game out there. The graphics are highly detailed and after a while you actually believe you are on a space ship. It is amazing to be able to float from point A to B smoothly and effortlessly. The puzzles are interesting and creative; challenging but not impossible to solve. Olivia is a great companion and her movements are stunningly life like. Once you exit the ship and actually float in outer space, you can see it's a really big, detailed ship you can explore from the outside. The experience is mind boggling. The only defect in the game is that the audio levels are uniformly too low even with the volume at 100%. I have other Oculus Rift S games where the audio is plenty loud. But in Lone Echo I have to strain to hear Olivia. It would be great if the audio in Lone Echo II was normalized (i.e. made as loud as possible). You can always turn it down, but if it is too low the only option is to wear earphones or earbuds- the former interferes with the headset, and the latter may fall out of your ears. Neither is a good alternative.","May 10, 2020 at 1:14 AM",5, 1,

Complete immersion, incredible esthetic, very good story, brilliant dialogues... and a gameplay that really gives credit to what VR is supposed to be. Moving around in zero gravity is a complete different experience ! Besides the level design is brilliant : not only you can go practically wherever you want but the gameplay itself is very rich : cut, scan, move objects, control your speed, your light, adjust your shield, choose your answers when asked... This was awesome really !
6-7 hours to finish the game for me : this is good, this is a real AAA VR game.
Lone Echo 2 is day 1 for me, absolutely no doubt.
Only regret : the lack of subtitles/little sound imbalance. Sometimes it's difficult to hear the dialogues (audio at 100% on my Oculus Rift S though). It can happen when your interlocutor is far from you or if the action took over. Sometimes also just because I was too concentrate lol. I would have appreciated to be able to have subtitles to catch up. I understand it would have messed up a little bit the HUD and the immersion but i'd have preferred to catch every piece of theses wonderful conversations.

2022-05-28 11:41:44.326625,DaddyFabio,Good experience,"Going to keep it to a few main points.
- The graphics are great. I tend to have high expectations so there were tiny disappointments such as the planet you're staring at not visibly moving but other than that there's no complaints there.
- Movement is great. You can navigate yourself with the thrusters you're equipped with, or you simply grab a wall and push yourself forward. An immense plus for me was that you could turn full movement on, as to also be able to float sideways, upside down, whichever direction you want really. It added that extra bit of realness and considering I'm a space fanatic that was perfect.
- The story itself was decent, and is the main reason why I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5. A big part of the story consists of you fixing technical difficulties around the ship. There were no real puzzles so there wasn't much of a challenge and the tasks at hand weren't nessecarily the most fun to perform. I wish they had done more with that. 

Either way, I still recommend the game as it's still really well made and overall fun to play. I wish the price tag was a little lower, but when you're playing the game, the production quality says it all.","Apr 13, 2020 at 5:33 PM",4, 2,Thank you for taking the time to share your experience playing Lone Echo with us.

However thanks to the Oculus Quest and the Link Beta, I was finally able to play this amazing game and it was 100% worth it. It is true that its not the longest game in the world, only taking me about 8 hours to play through the story, but as soon as I finished, I immediately made a new game and began playing through again. I could go on and on about how this game barely made me sick (I've got a bit of a weak VR stomach), or how doing chores had never been more fun, but the TL;DR would just be, I cannot wait for Lone Echo 2 to release!","Mar 2, 2020 at 9:47 PM",5, 13,Thanks for sharing your experience playing Lone Echo on the Quest via the Oculus Link Beta.

2022-05-28 11:41:47.483315,Son_of_Liberty,An Essential Rift Experience,"A captivating story between Captain Olivia Rhodes and her ECHO ONE service droid nicknamed ""Jack"" as they experience an unusual event while orbiting Saturn in their Kronos II mining station. The story itself is engaging as the mystery unfolds, however the constant (and often humorous) interaction between the two characters is easily one of the highlights of this experience. By the end of their thrilling journey I wanted to experience more adventures with these two.

As for the controls, they remain some of the best in the industry (even almost three years later!) simply because it feels effortless and fun to grab onto surfaces and drift off in zero-gravity. In the course in my eight hour adventure I rarely had an issue with the controls, which couldn't be said about most virtual reality games that I played. Controlling Jack in this game feels natural, even if he is a droid, which is what VR should aim to do in order to help immerse the player even more into the world.

Visually, this game is beautiful. I greatly enjoy outer space, so seeing how huge Saturn looks in virtual reality is nothing short of breathtaking. Environments are visually interesting and have plenty of little details to look at. Even better, most of those little items can be commented on by Jack and Olivia, which helps flesh out the two characters and settings even more. Part of my enjoyment of exploring the space station was just to find things that Jack and Olivia might comment on, which is a testament to the great writing and voice acting of those characters.

Lone Echo not only has fluid gameplay and beyond amazing immersion, but the story it tells really caught my eye. VR is meant to let people experience things they never really could; and floating around in zero-g, flinging yourself from area to area, and just being a freakin robot is something Lone Echo nails PERFECTLY. What really entails a perfect VR game is one that can literally pull you into the game, I was even panicking myself during the extremely tense parts. Having this game in your Oculus Library is an achievement in itself and is on par with other amazing titles such as Half-Life Alyx.

2022-05-28 11:41:53.823100,itsDomeE,Just beautiful and immersive game,"Lone Echo is one of the first VR games I played. And it's breathtaking. There were so many moments where I just sat there and enjoyed the beatiful view. The story, how you use your tools and interact with others and items is really immersive and awesome!
There are just two little things I would like to see changed in the sequel.
1. When you hold in microgravity onto things and you move your wrist or if you hold with two hands and move them, it would be more realistic if you body and view moved. Then you wouldn't have to turn the camera so often and it would be more immersive.

2. I appreciate your work on how you grab onto things and how each finger works correctly. But this leads to bugging out sometimes. It can be a little frustrating if you grab your objective panel and it just bugs comepletely out. Or if you want to put something in something and it just flys all over the place, because it can't handle the collision.

These are no big game breakers. And the game is still a 9/10, without them it would be a 10/10.

Not saying that's a bad thing, but flying around reparing stuff for 4 hours straight really made me want to RACE to just finish this game.  The controls are fine, the game looks amazing, the animations are awesome, voice acting is great - but it's all overshadowed by the constant 'go do this' and 'go do that' and you never get a break. Turn one switch on and then something bad happens to the other switch, go back to turn that switch on and then before you know it you've gone through these mundane chores to find out that something ELSE has gone wrong. When the majority of all you do in this game is press buttons and melt down vents / doors with your tool, it really gets to you. Ontop of that I found myself often getting lost. Constantly figuring out where to go. Not sure if it's just me, but every 15 minutes I had to annoyingly look around because the location to travel to wasn't clear enough I've never really had a problem like this in a game so I feel like I'm being picky complaining about it, but I did find it quite annoying.

I would note this game is not a fast paced action type of game, the focus is more on exploring and figuring out how to repair and move forward in the story. My only real complaint is the saving/checkpoint system. Currently there is no way to manually save the game, which wouldn’t be an issue but the game currently does not tell you when you have hit a checkpoint. So if you are like me and only hop on for an hour or two a night you are playing the guessing game when closing out for the night. I usually just tried to stop after completing a task, I didn’t notice any mid-task checkpoints.","Apr 5, 2020 at 11:36 AM",5, 1,"Hey there, thanks for taking the time to share your experience playing Lone Echo with us."

I would give it 4 stars overall but one thing just drives me crazy about this game. You can not save the game and it doesn't tell you when you've reached a checkpoint. All VR games should be able to be saved whenever you want because motion sickness can come over you at any time. Almost every time I start this game I have to play the last 5 minutes or more of the last play session. This ruins this game for me because every time I stop playing instead of thinking about all the fun I just had I wonder how much I'm going to have to redo the next time I play. It is just insane to me that they don't give you any indication of save points.  I honestly want to give it one star but the game is better than that. If they add notifications of when its saves or allow you to save whenever you want I will give this game 4 stars but until then I will leave it at 2.,"Apr 1, 2020 at 2:32 AM",2, 1,Thank you for taking the time to share your experience playing Lone Echo with us.

Great storyline, and I enjoyed the tasks. The ending was good, but it felt like a twist was missing, or an additional component that would have been more satisfying.

2022-05-28 11:42:12.957042,mdrejhon,"Five star game, but...","I am a deafie.

Fantastic game, but one big flaw for me as a deafie -- there is no closed captioning or subtitles.

Many developers read these reviews, and I realize you need to keep ratings high. But other developers (And Oculus Store doesn't have a ""Subtitles: Yes""), so I must write this review as a public service to other deaf gamers who need to base buying decisions on subtitles.
 
The best two methods are:
(A) ""Republique VR"" style in gentle-floating method 
(B) ""Red Matter"" pipboy style, glance-at-wrist method.

A very clever way to do it is the way Red Matter does it -- wrist mounted caption screen or subtitle screen.     This is superior to floating subtitles/captions, which are not realistic/nauseating in VR.

Real-world deaf people already use an app called ""Live Transcribe"" on android phones to caption real-life.  So this would just be a VR version of real life.  And there could be a backscroll feature if we miss dialogue, and maybe a ""screenglow"" effect coming from the bottom edge if we aren't lifting our wrists to read captions -- some of us might understand what's going on but only need to glance at captions when we need to.

Oculus Store gets docked a star because it does not have a ""Subtitles: Yes/No"" field like SteamVR does. I heard through a friend that some group at Gallaudet University (deaf university) is considering a lawsuit to Oculus to humbly request Oculus to make a minor change to Oculus Store (a Subtitles Yes/No checkbox) to get them to at least tell deaf gamers whether a VR game has subtitles or not.

I am informed the developers will add subtitles to Lone Echo 2.  Kudos to developers for doing this, though it would be nice to retroactively add subtitles.  However, if you are a deaf gamer and require subtitles, this review hopefully informs you accordingly since the Oculus App Store does not have a ""Subtitles: Yes"" field.","Feb 2, 2020 at 6:39 AM",2, 3,

While I enjoy some aspects of puzzles and what have you, its very limited and is an trial and error type of game. It can get very repetitive. The ""Checkpoints"" are not ideal, either. Perhaps an much better Checkpoint System might be needed.

If there is some way, to boost your HP as well, this will be a lot better to handle, as 2 strikes from an simple laser field and you are dead, there's no learning curve, just Trial and Error. (Longer HP Pool, More Checkpoints needed)

If a lot of factors are Dealt with, then the game positively deserves 5 stars, but for now its only 3.","Feb 23, 2020 at 4:42 AM",3, 0,Thank you for taking the time to share your honest feedback with us.

2022-05-28 11:42:22.486548,Ganbaregoemon,Never thought I could experience 1998,"again - the moment when I first played Half-Life.
Lone Echo is absolutely groundbreaking. The immersion is real. The only problem here could be that I develop a video game addiction to this.
Update: So I just finished the game, which is simply perfect: graphics, control, music, sound effects and of course the story! Expecially the ending got me - what a thrill!
BTW: nice touch using Gray/per Time for radiation dosing, and the depiction on how it affects Jack's body!
Though it could be a little bit corrected perhaps: Floating nearby one of those contaminated helium3-containers or being insuside the reaction chamber would give you realistically 300 Gy (or for Olivia as a human being Sv) per hour, or approx 0,1 Gy/sec. 50 or even 300 dGy/s as displayed by the wrist-computer is too much. See
http://imgs.xkcd.com/blag/radiation.png
https://infobeautiful4.s3.amazonaws.com/2011/03/2552_IIB_Radiation-Chart_Feb19.png
So for having a realistic geiger-counter it would display e.g. aboard the Kronos 0.60 to 1.5 µSv/h, outside floating around Saturn 1,5 mSv/h and nearing the dangerous stuff 50, 150, 200 mSv/h. Then very near the dangerous stuff it would show 100 to 1000 Sv/h or Gy/h.

Moreover, I finished it in 5 hours and was not rushing. I had fun and it was definitely a good experience, but it does depend on the price you are asking for.

2022-05-28 11:42:22.574314,HollywoodDR0,Outstanding VR experience!,"Lone Echo is great! It looks and feels amazing, with very impressive controls and physics. I'm really enjoying the story, but I do wish the puzzles were a bit more challenging, instead of being guided along the whole time. You are told what you need to do and then you explore the immediate area for the item or control panel, etc. There are game like tasks that require you to master the controls a bit which help break up that feeling.

Some of those tasks are navigating corridors while avoiding destructive elements (avoiding spoilers here) or completing multiple tasks within a short time frame. These help add a bit of challenge and break it up from being soley a story experience and a true game experience, but a little more puzzle wouldve been nice to balance everything out. 

I still think this is a must own experience and worth the price (especially if you catch it on sale) because it is truly outstanding, immersive, and engaging. It's possibly the most impressive VR game/experience I've tried and I can't wait for Lone Echo 2!

I originally gave this a poor review due to frustration from an issue with my CPU after an overclock that caused it to crash constantly.  I've sorted the issue (made a seperate overclock profile in BIOS that only uses the MSI gameboost and XMP presets) and now I am enjoying the game at high settings! So I made sure to write up a true review.","Feb 1, 2020 at 7:13 AM",4, 1,"Thanks for sharing your feedback with us.

Even after few missions I still was excited - but after couple of hours things started getting really boring. Puzzles are absolutely unintuitive and uninspiring, this is definately not Half-Life level. I noticed that I'm forcing myself to play the game. 

For me its clear now why game did not become popular - gameplay is just mediocre.  The only VR game with awesome complete SP experience so far is Boneworks.

2022-05-28 11:42:25.740969,Manydoors,Started off well.,"I was very deeply immersed into Lone Echo and the only word that came to mind was fantastic.  Unfortunately I then came to the part were you have to beat the clock and dodge the laser beams.  The game then changed from being a experience to a twitch arcade game which doesn't really suit VR games in space, also the game had the cheek to punish you for dying to the laser beam arcade game.  All immersion in the game died along with Jack.

Update:  Once I got past the disappointment of continually dying to a laser beam the game recaptured my interest and I love it.  It would be fantastic to play on flat screen but in VR it is something else.
On a side note, the beat the clock mini games are horrible and I wish there was some way I could mod them out.  Shame they had to dampen the experience with this silliness.  Loses a star.","Feb 4, 2020 at 11:14 PM",4, 4,Thanks for your feedback. We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience playing the game with us.

I completed the game and I must admit the story is cool. Without going into spoilering details I can tell you you're on a space mission but something goes wrong (of course) and you'll be in charge of sorting all the mess out. Nothing particularly original but it's well executed.
Graphics and sound effects (music there's none) are great and the overall gaming experience is worth it. But.
But keep in mind you're in space and you'll be just moving around clicking this or activating that. If it's action what you're looking for... well, you might consider some other title. This is more about exploring and solving relatively easy puzzles.

2022-05-28 11:42:32.093631,Braxus,"Updated my review to 5 star, here's why","I've changed my review to a 5 star for Lone Echo. It turns out that Lone Echo is very sensitive to overclocked CPUs. My I9-9900k was overclocked to 5GHZ on all cores, and even though it is a stable overclock according to Prime95, there is still that chance as with any overclocked CPU that you will encounter an app or game that doesn't fair well with it. Lone Echo just happened to be that magic number. 

So in essence, I've restored the CPU back to stock speed and the game runs just fine now. Oh well. This is one of those live and learn moments. But this can also serve as a future reference to those who experience issues with Lone Echo or any game that if you encounter freezes or crashes while playing your game, it could be due to an overclock. You know? Us overclockers are pushing our chips beyond the normal specs. So just restore it back to its original state, play your game until your finished, and then you can overclock it again if you choose to.

I want to give a really big shout out and a huge thanks to the supporting staff at Ready at Dawn for jumping into the VR community and making such an awesome game! Lone Echo II will also be in my library on launch day. I highly recommend this one as well to others out there!

Often times when I completed a session I would remove my headset and have to re-adjust to my actual self as I was surprised when I looked down and didn't see an Echo One's hands staring back at me.

It really sets the bar for an outer space experience.  You're floating weightless the entire time and the way you navigate in this 3D ""space"" is done very well.  
(Not sure how it would be for those sensative to VR motion sickness though.  I don't have that challenge so I can't judge that aspect.)

Highs:
- Excellent environments/design
- Stunning graphics (ran buttery smooth)
- Spot on physics
- Incredible and compelling story
- Great mix of experiences (slow exploration, tense puzzle solving, humor, awe inspiring environments)

Lows:
- Oculus exclusive; Wish it was on Steam!

You won't be disappointed.

When your outside of the ship building the robots to work on the site or whatever. The parts seem to just go through the aircraft making it impossible to pass this part. They are in a black foam substance and if you go to grab a leg out it pushes the leg behind it through the ship and then your just stuck and you can't finish the robots.

2022-05-28 11:42:44.906330,TheSwirlingBrain,My Favorite VR game so far!,I recently got my Oculus Link cable working for my PC to my Oculus Quest which sort of turns it into a Rift.  My first game to purchase was Lone Echo because I heard good things about it.  Wow was I not disappointed.  This game is so much better than I imagined.  I love the locomotion and the navigation styles.  There were a couple of places I didn't know what to do but finally figured it out.  I like this genre just because it forces me to use my brain and being VR forces me to move around for some exercise.  The visuals are just stunning and really immersive!  I wish there was a version for Oculus Quest so that I didn't have to use the cable but if that's what it takes I'm glad I took the Link plunge!  I really can't wait for Lone Echo II and I plan to purchase it the second it comes out!  Great job devs!  This is what VR should be!,"Jan 4, 2020 at 12:51 AM",5, 1,"Thanks for sharing your experience playing Lone Echo on Quest via the Oculus Link Beta, and for all the love!

Good story so far, come in to a nice mystery and wanting to figure it out and learn more. It's also a good way to spend time in space with good physics. Moving to fast causes me to get a little motion sick so I recommend playing for small amounts at a time and take regular breaks.

I bought this Rift game because it was super highly rated, and on sale.  I wanted to see what kind of experience it could be on the Quest through the generic link cable.

Amazing!  The other reviews will tell you how awesome the game is.  This review is here to tell you the experience on Quest was flawless for me.  I've play a little over 2 hours I think, in two different sessions.  Even parts that ask you to put something on your back worked perfectly, which seems impressive considering the Quest has no way to ""see"" my back.

Time to grab more stuff from the Rift catalog!!

We could not imagine having the opportunity to create something like this. It was unheard of. 2+hrs to render 1 frame for a cut scene back then (not even compositing). We were hand coding x86 to squeeze clock cycles out of those old boxes.

I enjoyed the heck out of the immersive levels, the mechanics (motion), the user input system, 3d models, leve ldesign. The touches like the dynamic textures were done very tastefully. The dev team should take a victory lap, this was very well done.

2022-05-28 11:43:07.253361,reb1rth,"Good, but overrated","I can see why people like Lone Echo, it's a new locomotion to show off VR, coupled with decent graphics, animations, physics and voice acting.  It's also at a high bug-free quality that ran well with 4xAA, no TXAA (horrid blur with that on) and everything else on its highest.  

The problem is that it quickly gets boring, and I had to push myself to allow the story to develop.  Then it got boring again just doing the same sort of thing over and over whilst being ordered around by anything you interact with.

For me, it sits somewhere between a technical demonstration of VR (this is good) and a very average game at best.  I never felt challenged and the penalty for dying (or whatever you'd call it in Lone Echo) is practically non-existent, and the method of respawning seems to destroy all believabilty.  

I am sure it was well recieved when it was released, and if you're venturing into VR then you'll appreciate it for the VR aspect (it's a family friendly game), for others, it's a 3-4 stars IMO.  I give it 3.5, and hope its sequel has a little more depth now that they have a polished engine and all the Lone Echo mechanics to build on.","Dec 8, 2019 at 12:08 PM",3, 1,Hey there!

The game itself is very well implemented in VR most of the machanics are intuative, the cutting tourch being a highligt. 
Feels like a 2001 or an Alien movie, just the right level of humor also.

You can let go, bring a little cube satilite with you and throw it off. That part is my favourite experience in VR.

On the down side, you do seem to spend a very long time flying through biomas later on in the game and if you crash into it you respawn and get dissorientated.

The game is beautiful, we get very good screenshots option. When you open the curtains of chrono's station and watch the planet that the space station is orbiting...I loved it

Every friend or family, when I show them the game, they are greatly surprised and  say they didn't believe that the VR technology was to this point. 

I liked the story, but it reminded me a book (adapted to cinema) that I have read, so a plot twitst was a little more predictable for me. (I cannot say the book, it will be huge spoiler)

I would have appreciated a subtitles option for non-english speakers. (at least subtitles in english).

Regarding comfort, at first I didn't do long sessions, but after a while I got used to the oculus and the game (VR set may require some time to get used to it), and I could play for longer sessions. For Lone Echo, comfort is not an issue in my opinion.

Now, I already watched the Lone Echo 2 VR trailer,  waiting and prepared for Lone Echo 2 launch.","Oct 13, 2019 at 10:21 PM",5, 14,Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to share your honest feedback with us.

It is so incredible to be floating around in space right in front of Saturn and doing the missions. That's the first half. The second half of the game is bordering on retarded. You literally have no enemy or other beings to interact with except biomass blobs. All you do, literally, is try to not run into them. I do not understand what happened with such a monumental start. It's like the writer of the game had so much gusto for the first part and then he just gave up and said ""and then there's three hours of avoiding biomass crap"".

2022-05-28 11:43:32.794121,Singland1,A must buy game for every VR-set owner,"Let's get one thing straight, I am a huge junkie for Sci-Fi and Space games; Ever since I saw the Alien films and played AVP:2 back in the day of potato PCs. So my review and experience with the game is affected by that.

I will try to keep spoilers to absolute minimun, only keeping some very minor details or things seen in the trailers in the review.

Some small details to set the review up:

The game sets on a station orbiting Saturn in the future, you're controlling the only ""intelligent"" and ""aware"" robot in the station but don't worry, the captain of the station and the only human in it: Olivia Rhodes resides in it with other robots who mostly are made to maintain the station. In the first minutes of the game after the tutorial, and after getting to know Olivia a bit, you're greeted to this BREATHTAKING view of the saturns orbit from the bridge window; shortly after this a blast of somesort happens, messing up the station and it's robotics, including you a bit; an anomaly appears near the station orbiting the planet, giving you a target and the reason to continue this adventure that you just started. 

Now to more basic stuff:

The game is in space, so with no gravity you use the enviroment to pull yourself forward, later you get a booster pack to help you spacewalk when you finally get to traverse the exterior of the station.

The art & Graphics

This game is beautiful, there is really no place to find where it looks low-poly, badly rendered or just ugly, every place in the game is brimming with detail and love that went into this game, and the space setting just is a topping on the cake here.

Story

Lone Echo almost instantly gives you a reason to keep going, never swaying away with bad writing or dialogue. The game just keeps giving more reasons to keep interest in it, at this time of review..I think I spent most of my playtime my mouth open because how immersed and cool it was to play through.

2022-05-28 11:43:32.842990,ArtoriasPlaysGames,Wha- Oh my god what!?,"This game was possibly the MOST Immersive experience I have had yet! with the way the movement system feels so natural and the great visuals and story its becomes a huge bundle of robotic love! After finishing the game I couldnt help but think: ""Wait, What do I do with my life now?"" This game kept me entertained the whole way. (SPOILER ALERT)  
When Olivia Lost conciousnes on the future ship bridge, And I was shocking her trying to revive her, I was actually starting to be worried. I felt emotion, more emotion than most other games ever give me. and my happiness when she came around was beyond belief.
(End Spoiler)
Its a suspensful, Immsersive, and Even heart warming story of two characters. 
Echo-1 (or as he is called: Jack) and Captain Olivia Rhodes. You are Echo 1, the only sufficient company for Olivia, nicknamed ""Liv"". The other bots, labor Bots, Arent as....socially adanced as your model. the witty humor, amazing character development and the noticeable friendship between Bot and Human makes these two chacracters instantaneously likeable. My only wish is for some DLC! (Spolier!)
What happens to the two after arriving in the future? Do they ever get back to their time? What about Apollo? Who attacked the future ship? what exactly WAS that bio weapon!?
(spoiler end)
Thats my ten cents on Lone Echo. My Optical servos are on the lookout for DLC or even Lone Echo 2!

Edit: The Anomaly seems to be disrupting my servos, Guess Ill just scan the Kronos-II databases for Lone Echo 2/DLC. Darn spatial fluctuations.

2022-05-28 11:43:35.944829,Tentax,Updated review,"Ok, after trying everything but the kitchen sink, I finally got the game to work properly.. Aparently, although it doesn't say so anywhere that I've seen, the game has a thing about multiple sensors and certain usb ports..
Now that it's working properly, the game is a real beauty. I give it 4/5 because you can't rotate using hand grips in zero-g, which is a bit counterintuitive. Maybe an idea for the next update..
Anyhow, here's what you need to know, for anyone who has the same problems I had: the game doesn't work with more than two sensors connected. If you have 3 or more (like me), disconnect them prior to entering the game. Also, if both of the remaining sensors are connected to usb 3.0 (even on different controllers), you get motion glitches. So just connect one of them to a usb 2.0 port and voila..you can finally play the game.
A note to the devs: i'd suggest you either fix it so the game works with more than two sensors, or make a note in the game description that the game requires a maximum of 2 sensors connected..","Oct 8, 2019 at 10:20 PM",4, 0,"Hey there!

2022-05-28 11:43:36.016637,Cidertron,In space no one can hear you sigh.,"Space waifu / blue collar spaceman sim Lone Echo is the pinnacle of opulence in VR. You can't fault the graphics and it's fairly obvious that what Oculus Studios were gunning for here was something that pushed the visual spectacle of VR to the current limit. They succeeded - the rendering and staging of this are probably Oscar worthy (seeing as the film Gravity won a few Oscars and this is essentially Gravity in VR).

So you're in space with a lovely British space lass with characteristically dry humour (she really was well written, voiced and looked absolutely amazing btw) - but what's a space robot to do? Well, as it turns out we're fixing a bunch of dodgy equipment by plugging things in and switching things on as per continuous instruction, followed by a second act of dodging space boogers. 

Now I have to admit here, I am not a very clever person. In terms of engineering skills, I struggle with the photocopier at work. But were these really puzzles or just menial tasks? I felt less like a quadruple digit IQ robo astronaut than a 12 year old on an apprenticeship at a Duplo factory. There was no challenge here, or maybe I've been playing these silly games too long. I would have preferred a more involved engineering challenge - maybe fitting those pieces of equipment together into a neat box in the right order would have been a good one. I struggle to see how the devs couldn't think of interesting challenges here - just watch some re-runs of the Crystal Maze and copy all those puzzles!

Then we go into some big, doomed super spaceship and deal with the satanic alien snot/booger dichotomy. This wasn't a terrible idea but somehow I rather liked the earlier staging without the aliens, it felt more real and by invoking the space snot, things felt less real and more like a game - except there wasn't much gaming to be had apart from those ever demanding switches.

So for Lone Echo 2 - more story, harder puzzles, more human characters, less boogers, please.","Oct 1, 2019 at 4:30 AM",4, 1,Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to share your honest feedback with us.

This is truely a breakthrough in story telling, just like half life was for its time. Everything about this game has been meticulously crafted, the graphics - the character details, Liv's facial details like her wrinkles, teeth, hair are life-like. The directional surround sound effects and music sets the atmosphere perfectly, the movement and controls simulate the feeling of floating in space, the story is well written and directed with mystery, action, suspence. Lone Echo is simply the best single player gaming experience right now, even after over a year since its release no other game can compare to this quality. It has taken me this long to write this review even though I bought the game when it first released, because I wanted to play this game at its highest quality settings and running at 90FPS.

This is far from short. I finished the game i 7 hours, and i believe i could have explored far more than i did initially.  This is a take your time kinda a game all sorts of things to see.

You play as an Echo-Unit, a human-like helper-robot aboard a ship accompanied by Captain, Olivia.  You're equipped with various tools at your disposal to solve problems and fix and ivestigate. 

Its a refreshing game, and quite different in that you wont shoot or harm anything or anyone.  I especially like this because instead of being another space shooter type game, its heavly focused on puzzle solving, investigating and communication. And they've managed to not make it repetitive as well.

Clever use of VR mechanics, levers, objects and navigation. It becomes second nature as soon as you get used to the controls.

2022-05-28 11:43:48.780411,jorgnaan,Phenomenal Game,"Lone Echo is by far the best VR game I've ever played. Many single player VR games are fun but lack in story. They have about an hour's worth of gameplay for the most part. Lone Echo on the other hand has hours worth of gameplay, each hour far more exciting than the last. The characters are very well done, the gameplay mechanics are awesome, the graphics are stunning, and the zero gravity movement works incredibly well. There is no better game I can recommend people get for their Oculus.","Aug 21, 2019 at 12:50 PM",5, 5,Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to share your honest feedback with us.
2022-05-28 11:43:48.804347,grumbel,"It's ok, but not much more","Lone Echo has two things going for it, a good control scheme and a nice presentation. The zero-g controls managed to give a good amount of freedom, without even a hint of motion sickness. Being limited to stick rotation and not having an option for two-handed grab rotation felt a little limited in the beginning, but one gets used to that. The presentation is quite nice, especially early when interacting a lot with Olivia.

On the downside is that this game doesn't really have much more to offer. All the cutting and holo minigames feel like taken straight out of Wii's Metroid Prime 3 and get quite repetitive. The rest of the gameplay boils down to fetch quests which get just as repetitive and leave little room for agency or exploration. The later half of the game also gets much less interesting, as most of it is spend separated from Olivia and moving slowly and carefully through dark and uninteresting corridors.

As for the story, well, there really isn't much of a story. You are on a space station and encounter a problem and than you deal with that problem, that's it. It all feels a little to straight forward and more like the first act of a larger story, than a whole story in itself. It's not bad, but it completely relies on the banter between Olivia and Jack, while everything else is just backdrop that never gets explored in depth.

All in all, it's fine, it doesn't do anything too offensively bad, while laying a solid ground work that a sequel can expand upon.","Dec 2, 2019 at 11:03 PM",3, 0,Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to share your honest feedback with us
2022-05-28 11:43:51.889697,NotTheLips,Great use of VR. But is it a great game?,"What's Good:

Movement Mechanics:  Grab and hold, push off to move, glide in weightlessness; super.  It's identical to Mission:ISS, which is pretty fantastic if you haven't tried it.

Interface:  In addition to movement, visor up and down (although that doesn't seem to impact the game in any way), activate and deactivate a Holographic PDA and Cutting Tool, are all done extremely well, using wrist-buttons; point to your own wrists, or your head to activate / deactivate.  Well done.

Ambience:  There's a Zen to the game as you play.  You can take as long as you like exploring the set-pieces, and there is a decent amount of stuff to discover.

Interesting characters:  Jack and Liv are likeable.

What's Bad:

Inconsequential Dialogue:  These have zero impact on the game's outcome, so conversation reply choices are superfluous.

Tedious Sections:  There are points in the game where navigation through very narrow, fatal, hot-spots is required.  These are absolutely annoying, frustrating, and only serve to artificially lengthen play-time.  There's another section which has you fly around on a timer, without clear navigational tools.  Hopefully the developers do away with these gimmicks in sequels.

Far Too Short:  Aside from the ""hot-spots"" and ""do this before time runs out"" issues mentioned to lengthen the game, there's not much here content wise.  Yes, it's a neat world they've created.  Yet without the tedious bits, the game's run-time would be very, very short.

Overall:

The game makes excellent use of VR controls and visuals, but strip those away and the game falls pretty short of the title of ""a great game.""  It's the VR visuals and controls that shine here, yet it's let down by the fact that the game is short, dialogue is tacked on without any consequences, and it's marred by the fly through killer hot-spots and timed sequences ... which are absolutely annoying.

Hopefully the next installments turn this into a good game in its own right, and not because it's VR.","Jul 14, 2019 at 8:19 AM",3, 23,

In the end I ripped through it in about 3 sessions of a few hours each. In short, it's everything the reviewers say it is: a truly remarkable VR experience that showcases the type of unique storytelling that is available with this technology.

The zero-gravity space setting utilized throughout the game works perfectly with virtual reality controls. Although you would think this might lead to some type of motion sickness, the opposite is actually true! I found it truly immersive and wonderous. The first time you push out through the airlock into the openness of space is one of those truly great wow moments in virtual reality.

- Great graphics and models
- Strong atmosphere
- Very high immersive
- Perfect touch pads realization
- Interesting game mechanics good utilize VR and touch pads potential
- High quality in-game training system (you never have questions ""how to..."")
- Interesting and sometimes exciting story
- Intuitive usefull interface

- Not high replayability
- No achievements
- No russian language (for me personally) or english subtitles at least to understand speaking easily
- Found few minor bugs

I strongly recommend to buy this game not matter what kind of game genres you prefer (me personally love shooters) because you just can't miss this experience. Don't wait a discount - i waited long enough (and didn't get any discount eventually) and i so regret i hold myself from this experience for long time. This game costs every dollar you pay for it.

Lone Echo is for sure one of the best games on VR yet. The complete freedom to move around anywhere you want and touch anything you want, is awesome. Also the game is long, compared to other games on the market. My favorite part was at the end when it didn't look like Olivia was going to make it. I was almost yelling myself , ""breath dang it... breath!""

Lone Echo is an amazing experience. The freedom of movement in zero G is pulled off so convincingly that it alone is worth the price of admission. And that’s before factoring in the great graphics, story, voice acting and more. 

But Lone Echo is also a flawed game. It has an ending that is equal parts finished and clearly set for a sequel. It lacks variety in its gameplay. And I experience a fair share of bugs. 

Despite some fairly serious gripes, I was captivated by the main characters, fully immersed in the world, and immediately revisited an old save just to explore and find collectibles (something I NEVER do in games) right after the credits rolled. 

More so than any other game I’ve played before, Lone Echo is a perfect game with plenty of flaws. It’s a must play for Oculus and VR owners.","Jun 3, 2019 at 2:06 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 11:44:20.759978,LuckySev,Most immersive game for me so far,"-- Motion Sickness
I'm usually pretty sensitive in regards to motion sickness but in this case I have experienced nearly nothing.
However, I use 360 tracking and that might be factor (this means I just turn around naturally / without using the sticks).

-- Controls
The movement system is just incredible and the introduction of all controls is very well made.
In the beginning it was fun just floating around. Later in the game it is required to steer precisely through space. But that was - at least in my case - no problem since you have enough time to learn everything.

-- Graphics & Audio
The visuals are detailed and the game looks nice. I use a Rift S with a Nvidia GTX 1080 and had no framerate related problems.
Audio fits to the scenario. There is no music (as far as I can remember) and you just hear your surroundings.

-- Story
I believe it is a decent storyline even for non SciFi lovers. Including some surprising ""wtf is going on"" moments.
If you are into the genre, then you will ask yourself the whole time about the backgrounds which can also be pretty fun.

-- Conclusion
All parts of the game fit together. The scenario, the controls and the visuals.
This is currently my favourite VR game.","May 27, 2019 at 6:05 AM",5, 5,

A lot of the tasks became redundant though but the storyline and micro-gravity experience was nice. If you consider this game you have to ask yourself if $15 per hour of content is worth it.

2022-05-28 11:44:23.972518,Mach13-13,Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!,"That must be what 'AAA' quality games mean, because this IS the expereince that sets the standard.  Of the 40+ VR experiences and games that I have this one is absoluely TOP of the list.  Took me about 9 hours to complete (Yes I was totally engrossed ) but there's plenty of scope (for me) to go back in to complete more of secondary mission objectives and just take in the breathtaking graphics (system specs below).  I was quite clumsy getting about at first but that sorted it self out when i got my space legs.

Its a game.  No its a story!  No its a VR extravangaza!  No its all of these and much more.  I haven't seen such a quality interaction with game characters before, all of the rendering is hard shelled, there's no poking your head through walls and the physics in  terms of action items has a perfectly natural feel.

I waited an age to buy this because of its price, but its by far the best game out here for Rift.  I cant' wait for Lone Echo II.

The gameplay has its moments of tension nicely fettered with reasonably thought provoking puzzle  elements and exploration.  As mentioned, there are optional missions which I ignored first time around but I will go back for them.

My Best VR game buy to date, that will be untill Lone Echo II no doubt!

2022-05-28 11:44:24.046321,Gibbonici,This is VR done right!,"This is by far the best VR game out there. It's the only one I've played that uses the Touch controller, the environment and the way you move to really put you in the world. Or ship, to be more exact about it.

The game is full of ""oh, wow"" moments, from the first time you look out at Saturn from the ship's bridge, to the simple act of pulling the scan panel out from your wrist scanner, to zero-g monkey-barring through the stations rooms and crawlspaces. It's all done with such attention to detail and consistency that you find yourself totally immersed in the situation. 

The station is well designed and feels authentic, and Olivia, the only human crewmember is well acted and animated. Watching her navigate around the station, it's easy to forget she's just an animated character in a video game. 

The zero-G physics are great too - you really do feel like you're floating around. When you have to pull a lever or pump a handle, you've got to grab onto something else so you can the leverage. It's all things you don't really think about when you think about zero-G environments, but it makes perfect sense when you're in the game.

I only have a couple of criticisms - one is that you get so immersed in the game that it's easy to turn yourself round and lose tracking. It's not a big deal (and not a deal at all if you've got a 360 setup), but it does take you out of the experience a bit when your arm is flickering between a couple of positions that have no relation to your actual arm. The other criticism is equally minor; to open your visor and switch on your headtorch, you have to press a button on either side of your helmet, but there's no indication where the buttons are supposed to be (they're on the bottom curves of your headset), but once you've found them you're good to go. 

Those minor gripes aside, the experience is otherwise flawless. This is VR as VR should be. I hope it sets the standard for other triple-A VR games to follow.","Apr 24, 2019 at 2:50 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 11:44:27.187043,booneytown,Lone Echo is a masterpiece,"Lone Echo is a stunning example of what can be accomplished with virtual reality. The visuals are jaw-dropping, the story is confusing in the best way, it makes you think hard. One of the best traits is that it doesn't lack content. Lots of great games built from the ground up for vr are 1 or 2 hours long (looking at you, Red Matter.) This game maneages to pack in 6 or 7 hours of intriguing and unique gameplay (you can even get a few more hours of gameplay if you complete all the optional tasks.) Last of all, the mechanics are great. Anything you can see you can pick up or propel off of. I was debating with myself whether I should get the game and I finally decided I would. Now that I've played it, I dare say Lone Echo might be the best vr game I've ever played. (coming from a person who has played lots of vr games.) So anybody like me, reading this wondering if they should get Lone Echo... Trust me, you won't regret it.


Side note: I'm seeing lots of comments talking about performance issues at certain parts of the game (particularly when you leave the space station.) I had the same problem. At that part of the game I noticed how bad my character's shadow looked and I went to turn up the graphics quality. I cranked it right up to max, (which almost always works for games on my computer.) And the frames dropped significantly. It worked at medium with standard resolution, but if you are experiencing problems, turn it down for that section.","Apr 18, 2019 at 8:55 AM",5, 9,

Everything about this game is pretty much perfect and I'm looking forward to the sequel a LOT.

The story is interesting and intriguing, with decent voice acting and sound design to back it up, and very pretty graphics. The gameplay has been designed carefully with VR fully in mind and is both really enjoyable and challenging, with some really well thought-out puzzles.

Even though you're able to turn with the analog stick, I'd really recommend a 360° set up for this game, as it's so engrossing that you tend to physically turn around a lot without realising (or I did, at least).","Apr 26, 2019 at 9:18 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 11:44:30.370160,Solomyn,This... is what I expected from VR,"Let me start by saying I am very nit-picky.  And cheap.  I want the absolute most bang from my buck.  I had very high expectations when I bought my Oculus, and because of my high expectations, I have been dissapointed by many experiences that are out there.  Many just rushed to get a game out so the developers can say they are developing VR experiences.  Bad locomotion, horrible performance, clunky mechanics, or thin plots... there are a lot of them out there.

I read the reviews on this game, and felt that it was worth the try.  I feel that RPG experiences like this is where VR really sets itself apart from regular gaming.  

I was absolutley blown away from the begining.

The visuals... the sound (classical music playing in the background for a very Stanley Kubrick - Space Odyssey touch is perfect!), the mechanics, the story line... this experience (this is so much more than a game) is absolutley incredible.  The locomotion is absolutley brilliant... it truly makes you feel weightless.  

The cool part... is the little things like touching your arm to engage your plasma cutter... or touching the top of your hand to watch the scanner engage.  It's like being in an Iron Man suit lol.

This is very much so worth the money.  I really can't anything wrong with it.  If you're on the fench about buying it... do it.  You'll come to appreciate VR much more so once you do.  I know I did.","Apr 13, 2019 at 8:17 PM",5, 6,

Lone Echo puts you in the place of Jack. A seemingly AI robot with gadgets galore. Gadgets include a Scanner, Thursters, A laser Cutter, And a EVA pack that alows massive boosts of speed, as well as thrusted braking. But thats not what matters here. With the Oculus touch controls this game is Crazy immersive. Being able to grab and pull or push myself throughout the enviroment was oh so satisfying. Easily my favorite part of this game is just maneuvering throughout this stunning world. The game does have a pretty solid Story line as well if story is your thing. The missions are fun. While quite easy, maybe to easy. But it didnt bother me. The game was a little short, as seems to be a trend with VR titles. But not to the so short you feel jipped point. I selfishly just wasnt ready for the adventure to end. I hear Lone Echo 2 is coming so im so excited to see where they take this promising franchise. NOTE this was the first game i played when i got my VR and not much else has come come close to the feeling i get when playing this game.

2022-05-28 11:44:59.220097,jcmcronus,Well worth it,"Jeez, where do I even start?
I'll start with: I played this in a standing mode but will play again with roomscale very soon.
This game is beyond anything I expected. The graphics are tremendous. The story is wondrous and full of twists which makes it engrossing to play.
The Zero-G feel is as real as it gets. I had far too much fun propelling myself around by grabbing things and flinging myself forward.
When it comes to any game, especially in space, immersion is paramount for a good time and this one nailed it right on the head. There were a few times I forgot I wasn't in space (cheesy, but true). I had a hard time taking the headset off for water or snack breaks.

The story starts simple and peaceful and works its way into something much more than I expected. Let me tell you, I am a complete sucker for plot twists and unpredictable moments. I enjoy being thrown off what I believe is going to happen. It keeps me on my toes ;)
Another nice touch is the amount of graphics options in the settings menu. I have a high-end rig and ran into some latency issues but I was able to adjust it over the course of 5-10 minutes to dial it right in and avoid any motion sickness.

My only hatred (which isn't worth deducting a star), is the saving system. I was hunting down some objectives before moving on in the game and decided to take a break to the real world, something came up and I had to quit. I was disappointed when I came back to see all that work had been undone. The ability to add a manual save would be a nice touch.

I've already recommended this to a few friends, and I can confidently suggest it to anyone looking to buy it. I'm a stingey buyer and was hestitant to drop $40 on a game but I am beyond happy that I did. If you're hestiant, don't be. Buy this, play this, love this and at the end, be prepared to be impatient and counting the clock for Lone Echo 2.","Dec 3, 2018 at 4:50 AM",5, 27,

2022-05-28 11:45:05.603652,enriverd,The perfect game for VR,"This is the best game I have played so far in VR. You can tell it has been designed specifically for VR, and this makes a huge difference. For instance, you can move your character in the 3D space in any direction by activating some thrusters, and the character actually floats from position A to B, while in other games you kind of get teleported to the next position, which breaks the immersion.
The story is superb, the atmosphere perfect, and the graphics and designs are really cool. The game itself is not than long, compared to console games, but it is the longest I have played so far in VR. If you own an Oculus headset, this game is a must!

This is what makes Virtual Reality the future... total immersion into a world that is unlike anything you can ever experience in person.

Your interactions throughout the ship feel as close to real as anything in VR can.  Gameplay wise, it may not seem like a lot.  But the game is enhanced by the fact that you can do things yourself.  It's not like many console games, where you press ""A"" to activate something.  In this, if you need to flip a lever you do it.  Need to scan something?  Press your wrist activated scanner, aim at the target, and pull the trigger.  It sounds commically simple, but in VR it works so well to bring you one step deeper into the game experience and lose yourself in the narrative.","Jan 14, 2019 at 11:43 AM",5, 2,

I played it on lower settings via how it installed, but it still looked pretty darn nice. Imagine what the high Performance must be like? One or two bugs worried me at first, but I got the game cooperating shortly afterwards. For supposedly playing with less than suggested specs, I did quite well with it.

This kind of experience is what VR was made for - everything just works beautifully together, from the movement system to the story, the acting to the environments - just brilliant. Just like many of the other reviews say, if you have Rift + Touch and you don't have Lone Echo - you are missing out. 

There are so many great moments in the game, but if I had to pick one it's when you first go out of the airlock and leave the station. I just had to stop and look around for a bit. The sensation of floating there, alone, with the rings of Saturn beneath you and the planet ahead is wonderful, and deserved to be savoured.

After a lot of different VR games, some better than others - this blew me away. I was awe struck by all of the interactions, the dialogue, the writing, the controls - everything! So far I'm 1½ hours in, which feels like 10  minutes have passed. Don't worry about motion sickness, just make sure to have a beefy computer (which I guess you already have playing VR). No horror, no shooting - just a fantastic immersive story with an element of puzzle in the mix and a lot of interactions. Oh and do be careful while playing, I got so immersed I almost lost my balance when trying to catch something in 0 G.

I spend yesterday 4 hours playing this game non stop, it was great to follow story mode. Havent finished the game but so far it's been a great expirence. This is what VR games should be in quality and expirence for users. 

I also higly recomend Echo VR (ARENA). It's some kind of spinof of this game designed for multiplayer PVP combat in space. Notice there is a free version of echo VR where you fight to score points by crossing a disk to score a goal but inside that game you can purchase Arena mode.

Yes, you are just a robot repairing things. But what makes this game so special is its 100 % immersion. You can go everywhere, take your time to look at things. Grab things, get their description, and interact with them. The gaphics are really perfect, the movements are very realistic. You get your missions, and can do them in the time you want. If you don't care, then just walk around the ship and enjoy the view. It's great. After a very short time you feel like you're really there.
The idea of being the mind of a robot is a good solution for the gameplay: if you die, your mind is just transferred to a new robot. This makes you really feel like being that AI instead of just dying and going back to the previous level.
Also, there is no big tutorial at the beginning. instead, you learn new functions during the game, like an update of your personal AI software. They really thought about everything in this game.","Jan 7, 2019 at 4:40 PM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 11:45:18.536481,Z3DT,"Masterful storytelling, though short","This game is a bloody masterpiece.

Though the story is only a couple of hours long, it's still long enough to entertain you for three or four sittings at least. It's beautifully told, in a way that could only work in VR. You *are* Jack. There is no doubt about that fact. The VR experience greatly enhances the way this story is experienced. There is no way the impact this story has would work in the same way had this been a normal video game.

But where this game truly shines is the gameplay. Many VR games have a way of locomotion that can make you feel motion sickness or, as some even call it, VR-sickness caused by the disconnect between the ""you"" in the game and the ""you"" moving around in real life. Echo (and some other games as well) eliminate this entirely by, in a sense, having no locomotion at all. Movement is done through hand movements almost exclusively by putting you in Zero-G. You push off walls or use wrist jets to move forward. There is no disconnect between your real and virtual legs because you don't use your virtual legs at all.

The game is perfect in its simple gameplay, and enhanced by its beautiful storytelling. The story was short and left many questions unanswered, but I'm sure the upcoming sequel will take care of that issue.","Dec 26, 2018 at 2:40 AM",5, 2,

Unfortunately the sim suffers mightily in the second half (so far) due to the ongoing repetitive and boring tasks I've had to endure.  It really has turned in to a slog that has caused me to care less about the environment and the game play and more about just getting through and getting it over with.  I can say with conviction that if the second half of the game occured in the first half, I wouldn't have made it more than 20-30 minutes before giving up.  

Having invested this much time however, I will see it to the end and hope that the finale redeems the overall experience.  If that's the case, I may consider raising my rating from three stars to four.

EDIT 1-20-19 -    DNF.  I tried several times to go back in and finish this game but I just couldn't get past the boredom of the second half.  To make matters worse, I thought I would force myself to finish it tonight but when I went in, the game had set me back by at least two save points for some inexplicable reason.  No way was I going to endure all that lava-floor/walls nonsense I had made it through, again.

I'm leaving my rating at three stars just because I really enjoyed the first half so much.  I may even come back and play that part again some day.  After I get my fill of Brass Tactics.","Jan 21, 2019 at 12:09 PM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 11:45:31.428518,AngryHorse,Stunning!,"The best game you can buy for VR (namely for Oculus Rift) of all time (for now). Perfectly developed interaction with environment and the movement leads you into a great story. You can touch everything (even the captain, but she will pull you away and say something ""nice"" to you). You can hit walls and objects with your head, so do not expect looking through textures, which is typical for some else VR games.
In this game is created whole your robotic body and its physic in zero gravity is very real. Graphic is very nice too, you will be amazed by more or less open outer space and by the interiors of mining station Kronos II. Graphic of characters (well, graphic of only one living person on this station – captain Olivia Rhodes) is very nice too.
The game is mostly an adventure, it has heavy mood of the unknown and of outer space. It is definitely not FPS. There are quests about searching, creating, connecting objects or energies together, etc.
First walkthrough is around 4 - 6 hours, which is pretty good since it is VR game. Lone Echo is perfect presentation of how powerfull VR games could be and how they should look and work.

The way you can pull yourself along and push off from surfaces is just fantastic. The only thing that was a little odd, was that you can't rotate by pushing with one hand and pulling with the other (which should turn you towards the ""pulling"" side). Since it is possible to rotate with the sticks, it doesn't impair gameplay, but it did detract (very slightly) from the total immersive feel.

I have seen some complaints that the missions are just ""busy work"", but to me that was part of the immersion. I really felt like I was zipping through space making repairs and I found it to be a lot of fun.  I also liked the way it used ""calibration"" as a way of introducing the various controls.

The control method, the story, the gorgeous graphics, the depth - all come together to show what can be done in VR when great minds come together with a purpose.

It's not cheap but it's worth every penny - the game lasts a long time and you fully get your moneys worth.  It's no longer a new game but even playing in now made we stare in wonder at some of the effects and design.

I have to give it 5 stars but it is not perfect.  The gameplay is a little simplistic and often repetititve and you get frustrated at times when you cannot proceed and get stuck but the story drives you on as there feels like a real purpose to your mission.

We simply need more games with this amount of polish and craft to really make VR take off - for me the VR market feels like the old 8 bit days when every man and his dog was having a go making a quick buck.

2022-05-28 11:46:00.233073,servitore,"Engrossing, Immersive, Must-Buy","I was hesitant to drop $40 on a game that would only last me 6-9 hours, but I do not regret it one bit. This game is a fantastic story-driven game with a massive focus on experience, atmosphere, and ambience. You play as Echo One, a robot with exceptional intelligence aiding a station's captain, Olivia. You wake up on Olivia's last week as an interstellar anomaly knocks the station's systems awry. 

This game's appeal is the huge steps towards adding immersion it takes. Your whole robot body is rendered, from head to foot, and your body collides with the environment. Since you are in space, the movement system basically treats your robot hands as if you were Spiderman, allowing you to grab any anchored object to propel yourself forward. You also have 3 sets of thrusters to perform small boosts, large boosts, and braking boosts. The movement system combined with the full-body rendering create an instantly immersive experience that had me grabbing the air to move if I dropped my controller.

The gameplay and story are solid as well. The gameplay mostly consists of doing cool space stuff, exploring, and repairing things. The story takes a huge focus on your (Jack's) relationship with the captain, Olivia. Olivia is the only human you ever talk to at length and one of only 5 or so characters with dialogue. This doesn't detract at all, and it serves to aid the game's theme.

Overall, this game defies numerical rating. It is a must-play game and experience that is easily a killer app for the Rift.","Sep 20, 2018 at 1:51 PM",5, 2,

It wasn't until I started playing a handful of other VR games did I not begin to really appreciate the design of this game. The concept of free floating, and being able to grab anything and interact with them, although might be a small detail, but just brings the whole experience to life.

The movement and controls is what really blew me away the first time around. Being in Zero G, the mechanics of grabing onto, well, anything, and pushing and pulling yourself, is such an immersive and fluid feeling. The gadgets on your wrist and how you use them throughout the game is very well implimented, you feel like a repair droid, and everything just feels like it's all in your control.

The visuals are absolutely stunning. Going for a more realistic look, space has never looked so gorgous, and being able to float around and explore outside of your ship, you get a serious sense of scale and how vast space is, it's stunning.

It's true, this game doesn't have much to offer in the way of ""missions"", it's the common ""fix this, get that"" type, but the story behind everything, and the character you play as and you play with, are very well done, along with the stunning visuals and smooth gameplay, you actually *want* to do these ""chores"". The story is really interesting, and does keep you thinking as you play through the game.

Simply an amazing experience for a VR game, I absolutely recommend it to anyone into VR.","Jul 31, 2018 at 10:42 AM",5, 8,

This game is fantastic.  It's not for those that are looking for action packed, it's for those wanting to feel fully immersed in another reality, where what you do has more meaning than just killing stuff off.

It has a great story going for it and as I got deeper into it I was even more anxious to hear the rest.

Graphics are hella nice.  I'm running them at full everything and the debug tool with my setup, but even before I had a more powerful card I was impressed.

Now why not 5 stars?  Well, there is some redundancy to it.  That part is not too bad though but what really cost the star was when I got deep into the story there were parts where I spent more time hunting for items than actually progressing the story.

The views of the space around the station are beautiful. For a non-combat game focusing on survival I was amazed how much fun it was and would love them to make another.

The character interactions and the way you interact with the environment are fantastic, particularly in the early sections.  It is not an action packed game: on the contrary, it's at its best when it's simply tasking you with doing normal things in this other world.

Unfortunately, it tries to be more of an actual game in the 2nd half: the storytelling fades into the background and there's ways to die everywhere.  Without spoiling too much, the game does away with its great traversal system where you can throw yourself off of objects by making 90% of surfaces punish you for touching them.  It's not as harsh as it sounds (if you take it slow, it's not that difficult), but it begins to feel very tedious and despite the game's length of 5 hours, the repetitive nature of the 2nd half actually made me wish the game were shorter.

Overall, it's an experience you must try to really see what VR is capable of.  However, due to the second half feeling fairly weak, I would recommend waiting until it drops to $30 instead of the standard $40 price.","Nov 11, 2018 at 1:33 AM",4, 1,

I feared that I was blowing money on something that would just collect dust when the novelty wore off.  At first I thought I was right after starting off with a few free and budget titles.  Then I purchased Lone Echo and found my investment in VR to be completely validated. To me this game embodies the potential of VR as a first class  gaming platform.   This game really feels like it was built from the ground up to be in VR and the controls were thoughtfully developed for the medium.  Ambulating in the zero-g environment is so intuitive and and fun it quickly becomes second nature.  As the difficulty curve starts to set in you'll find find yourself using the grab, boost, and thrust controls to negotiate your way through challenging and dangerous environments with a sense of purpose.  Your hands aren't just virtual pointers like many of the other games I've tried.  They are completely integrated into the experience.   Heads up display?  Nope.  They keep your mind grounded in the environment by making you look at your wrist to check your status.  Even the dialogue options are cleverly integrated into the game space using a virtual menu interface.  All of this adds up to a truly immersive experience when it comes to how you interact with the game world but how is the story?  I'm glad you asked.  Lone Echo isn't some grand opus that expects you to invest yourself in it's world history and culture.  It's an episode and a well done one at that.   The story is strong enough within this finite space that you  actually become invested in it without being encumbered with excess baggage.  I could go on but I'm running out of space so I'll finish with a pointer.  The view control is ""stepped"" as a default.  I highly recommend changing it to a more fluid setting.  If motion sickness is a concern I recommend using Sea-Bands.  I got mine for less than $10 and they worked like a charm.","Jun 21, 2018 at 5:18 AM",5, 11,

The VR controls, although very fluid are used for just repetative and trivial tasks. Sure I appreciate the change of pace from typical VR shooty games but this goes too far the other direction making me just feel like a mechanic. 

This wouldn't be so bad if the tasks you have to do didn't feel so overtly video-gamey; a moment that comes to mind was when a character gave me the objective of ""activate these three consols in less than 70 seconds, or the system resets!""

Story wise its pretty typical sci-fi stuff, and although its all quite well acted its thurougly predictable and you'll know pretty much how its going to go by the half way mark if you're well-versed in the genre. 

I appreciate the attempt to make a full-lengh ""ground-up"" VR game and we certainly need more of these but if it weren't for this game being one of the first I really don't think it would be so highly regarded.","Aug 27, 2018 at 3:08 AM",3, 5,

The mechanics work almost perfectly, the feeling of immersion is the best you can get right now and the hand animation... Oh, the hand animation. Sometimes I would just stop and look at my hands for like 10 minutes straight. The detail and realism are just unbelievable.  The story offers a lot, even if they could have gotten even more out of their narrative design with a bit more planning ahead of time.
The locomotion is revolutionary, the same goes for user interface. It's a complete game changer and the fact that this kind of intuitive control is even possible ensures the future of this medium. Thank you, dear creators, for making this game. (The only thing left to work on here is the flat menu)
My only major complaint: Why would you put a jar of peanuts on the ship, fit the animation gesture perfectly and then make it impossible to open??? Every single person who has tried this game on my system has tried to open it. That would be the little cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesome that is this game.

2022-05-28 11:46:55.044762,Minoxus,Best VR game I've played so far.,"This game is phenomenal. Bought it full price and its certainly worth it. The gameplay and story are both great. 

You might feel a bit nauseous at first but you quickly get used to it. The game is zero G but the devs have provided you with a 'down' at all times, which makes it very bearable (So don't worry if you played anything like the ISS sim and got sick, its not like that) but still retains the feeling of floating around. 

Performance wise you might have some hiccups as it is quite demanding. However, I managed to play it just fine on low on a 780 ti. Some unofficial tricks are to minimize the mirror view of the game on your regular monitor, which I've found to help me quite a lot. Should you start having FPS drops restarting might help. If I played for an extended period and as a result loaded quite some areas (going outside was the first instance of this happening) I noticed the game began bogging down, which a restart fixed, albeit temporarily, in my case. This is was only a problem early on in the game, later areas I could play for 3-4 hours without a restart.

The story is captivating and the interactions are great, I'm unsure if different reactions give you different endings though.

Truly worth a try, and if you're still unsure, pick it up during sales and you won't regret it.","May 24, 2018 at 7:13 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 11:46:58.288247,Arparso,Best VR game yet,"You play as an advanced robot with AI personality, stuck aboard a mining station near Saturn with your human captain when a weird anomaly disrupts your daily routine and causes significant damage to the station. The next hours will be spent fixing broken systems, scanning disabled cube sats and navigating hazardous spaces filled with radiation or mineral cutting laser beams. All in zero G and beautiful graphics.

But that's not the highlight - the story and its presentation is. The voice work is flawless and you will immediately bond with your human partner, having actual conversations with smalltalk, jokes and emotional or thrilling moments. And just when you THINK the game is about to end, there's another three to four hours of content waiting for you to master in an unexpected finale.

Granted, this last act is probably the weakest. The Khronos II mining stations is spectacular and varied - both on the inside and outside. The last environment, however, looks a bit too repetitive, making navigation harder and annoying. It's still good, but not AS good as before and it starts to drag and repeat itself in the last hour or so.

Controls are near flawless and the game can be played both seated or in roomscale. Rarely I could feel a bit motion sick, but it never got too bad and I definitely had a few multi-hour play sessions without pauses. Just... just don't use the ""vomit comet"" too much (you'll know what I mean when you find it).

Yeah, most immersive VR game yet, which is not just a simple shooting gallery, but a full-blown game making good use of everything that VR has to offer.

Unfortunately the actual gameplay is very mundane with simple tasks that get repetitive very quickly. Lots of filler which artificially makes what should be a 2-3 hour experience take around 6-8 hours. I found myself wishing for the game to end pretty soon after starting the second act. 

The story is basic and told well enough, but nothing revolutionary. The basic flow is go to location A, story event happens, you have to find 3-4 things and put them in the right places, continue story by moving to next location. The last room had 3 or 4 mundane actions to perform and as I was so bored by this point the story lost any emotional impact.

I liked the world and the ""experience"" of being there, but wished the actual gameplay and pacing was a lot more intersting. For a VR experience it is very polished, as a game it left a lot to be desired.","Apr 2, 2018 at 12:51 AM",3, 12,

2022-05-28 11:47:20.959085,Hyperionxvii,The Good and the Bad,"Let me start off by saying, this is the best looking VR game I have played and the most immersive. In the early part of the game when I'm going around with Liv to repair systems, the immersiveness is intense. I was home alone playing this when someone outside the house made some sort of loud noise and it startled me, I turned around looking for something in the darkness of the area I was in, when I realized I'm in a game and that the noise was coming from the real world. It's that immersive and the graphics are the best you are going to see on the Rift. 


The troublesome part is that the controls can be maddeningly frustrating. There are some parts where you are trying to do something and it's incredibly frustrating. You drop something and it will just go floating off whereever because of the zero gravity. Dealing with stuff like that and getting frustrated will get you motion sick very quickly. Last time I played it I had to quit and felt very sick. And I rarely get motion sickness in VR. A real shame because it's a really great game if not for the controls.","Apr 8, 2018 at 10:26 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 11:47:20.987010,Malific,This is how a VR game SHOULD feel.,"**Warning incoming wall of text**
Lone Echo has a good plot, settings, character, etc, etc. But that's not what I want to talk about. I want to talk about how this game FEELS, especially in terms of movement.

In most other VR games how you move through the world is usually the primary immersion breaker. Lone Echo's movement doesn't break you out at all. The game takes place in a 100% zero G environment, movement is performed the way anyone would in such a situation. You grab something and you push off of it. No joystick wiggling, no pointing there and teleporting. It's so intuitive and natural I would have paid money for this if it was purely an environment exploration simulator. The game reacts properly to the amount of force you use and the timing of letting go of a surface. Once I had the hang of it, it was like magic... err science. I could send myself shooting directly across a span of empty space with near pin point accuracy, or simply push myself into a parallel glide along the surface I had just been holding onto. Since my body was creating the motion in reality it always expected the motion that was occurring in VR, so I experienced no disorientation or nausea, except for rare situations with sudden unexpected stops. Usually because I wasn't looking where I was going. Having completed the game, I find myself simply wanting to start over, progress the plot to a certain point where I have access to all the areas in the game and then simply leave that save there so I can come back and play in enviroment whenever I want to. THAT is how good navigating in this game is. I want to come back JUST so I can move around in it.","Mar 24, 2018 at 10:26 PM",5, 9,

My only real complaint is that there are a few times in the game where you are supposed to be doing something that is urgent and I had a hard time finding the quest objectives which made me become frustrated, shattered the sense of urgency, and really took me out of the game.

Also, while the game does a good job announcing where you need to go, it's not always clear if you put the game down for a few days and lose track of what you were doing.

2022-05-28 11:47:30.576627,Chatoyance,,"Lone Echo is literally the best game I have played, thus far, in VR. It is the only game where I completely forgot that I was in VR, or that I was playing a game at all. This became real to me. I cared about Olivia, I cared about myself as Jack, I felt like I was in a place, living an adventure. I became lost in the narrative, and in the experience itself. This, above all other VR games and apps, showed me what VR really means to the future.

I can only dream of this basic construction being given an open-world treatment. To be able to own a ship, configure and repair it, to exist in a universe with other on-line players, to trade and explore, to live in this game world - oh, if only Oculus would do that! This is how space in VR should be done. This made me feel like I was truly 'there'.

But even in a single story, even within a finite experience, Lone Echo is magnificent. Everything is done with the hands - opening hatches, cutting metal, repairing technology, using buttons and pressing numbers on keypads - or throwing a rubber toy against a wall. The physics are brilliant, objects spin and move in zero gravity, and everything is just like one sees in NASA video from real-life orbit.

I recommend unleashing yourself from snap-turning, always level, no rotation, and all the other 'Oh God, It's VR, Beware!' constraints. The movement is best when it is natural and smooth. I only wish pitch and roll could have been made as natural as yaw can be set to be. That said, gliding about from hand-hold to hand-hold is as close as anyone will get to being in real Zero-G.

This, above all, is a game, with a story and characters that matter, it is intelligently written and absolutely worth anyone's time. It is like a fairly good science fiction film, only the player is allowed to live it. The interface is fantastic, and everything quickly becomes as natural as breathing to operate, use, and interact with. 

This is a must-play, must-get wonderment that everyone should play.","Jan 23, 2018 at 11:46 AM",5, 17,

I sat down with it most of a Saturday and got to a stopping point that I would assume is pretty far into the storyline. The problem is that I tried to pick this game back up a week later and it had become unplayable.

Nothing had changed in my hardware or software since I had sat down with Lone Echo the weekend prior. But suddenly I was experiencing excessive screen freezes and stuttering while trying to continue, even on the main menu. It made me sick to my stomach pretty quickly and made it hard to even have the app running. 

I dropped all of the in-game settings down to their lowest and it didn't seem to affect anything. I loaded prior saves and it did nothing. I even uninstalled and reinstalled, sacrificing my progress in the game, and nothing changed. I'd wonder if it were something on my end if it weren't for the fact that Lone Echo is the only app that's had this issue. Even Echo Arena still runs the same as always.

Don't get me wrong, it was a fantastic experience while I was actually able to play it, but now I'm stuck with a broken app and half the experience I paid for.

2022-05-28 11:47:30.665389,Wrackey,A must play for Oculus Touch,"The best VR game I have played so far for a couple of reasons:
1: It's fairly long and diverse. It is a story driven VR game that took me around 6-8 hours to complete, and in that time, you navigate different environments as the story progresses.
2: Best... Touch integration... Ever. The way you use your fingers to press buttons and activate tools is just great. Tapping the top or bottom of your wrist for instance, activates different features. The fact that you literally use your fingers for this helps the immersion tremendously, and the game makes great use of this. Other interactions of grabbing and moving stuff around works well and really fits in this game.
3: NO TELEPORTATION. Since the entire game plays in microgravity, you float! The game introduces you to this with very subtle movement where you drag yourself around from point to point at first. It steps it up a little by adding subtle boosters to help you. A bit later it ads a bigger boost to help you move quicker etc etc. It really helped me ease into it, and has made me more resilliant in other ""less comfortable"" VR titles. And after I finished Lone Echo, Teleporting felt just lame. The fact that this game is a fluent motion from start to finish also helps with the immersion.
FINALLY: Whether this is the game for you will depend on what you think of the story and the setting. But as far as VR integration goes, this game is at the top of my list. This is what I want in VR titles.","Feb 17, 2018 at 6:55 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 11:47:37.088004,RuneSR2,The greatest game since Doom in 1994!,"Sometimes games arrive that revolutionize a genre. To me that happened with Doom in 1994, 3dfx Voodoo Graphics Tomb Raider in 1996 and now Lone Echo in 2017 (ok maybe Outcast in 1999 too ;-) 
Lone Echo is the first VR game to get top rankings on Metacritic: to me true VR gaming was born the minute the first native VR game reached such hights among reviewers. Thus true VR gaming was born with Lone Echo, and I can't express in words what I've felt playing this game. Lone Echo is an experience, I'm thankful to Oculus and the Lone Echo developers for making such visions come to life. 
I've been running the game using a i7 7700K cpu, 16GB 3200 Mhz ram and a MSI GTX 1080 Gaming X 8GB (factory overclocked). I've set the supersampling to 2.0 in game and deactivated MSAA (couldn't see any changes without MSAA). The game has run flawlessly, even outside the station. This is a game that'll push your hardware to the max, you'll need 3 sensors, and do increase the resolution (=supersampling) all you can, it makes the game so much more beautiful!
This isn't a 5/5 rated game, it's 10/5 ;-) I've completed the game and there's no doubt it's the best computer game ever made - the game is so far ahead of everything else that currently there is no competition. Completing this game was worth every $ I payed for the Rift - and more.","Feb 18, 2018 at 7:13 PM",5, 14,

*****************Mild Spoiler Alert*********************


I am a completionist, so I was hunting those cube sats like a crazy person. I got all of them except---- 2. But then the game propels you into the second act and there is no way to get the last 2. I wish there was some warning, I guess? Like I said, small issue. Or after beating the game, allow the person to go back to the first act specifically to finish the cube sat mission.

Btw, I enjoyed the first act way more than the second act. The second act felt like any sci fi action game (in visual aesthetic) like Halo or Dead Space, but the first act had real heart and a feeling of open world exploration. One thing that I'm discovering really helps VR is if a space feels lived in as opposed to the usual computer graphic's default-- which to me is often sterile. One way to accomplish this is to litter the area with personal stuff that real people accumalte while living life- in various states of wear and tear. This game did that well in the first act. It also had technology that was closer to our own,- I bought into THAT world more. This is just my opinion and I am just some dude on the internet. I leave reviews to support the medium.","Jan 30, 2018 at 11:15 AM",5, 4,

It allows for exploration. The locomotion is awesone. The graphics do a great job of creating an immersive atmosphere. Lots of attention to detail. Sound effects are superb.

2022-05-28 11:48:02.922924,Iskarien,Wonderful game with a few small issues,"I'll mention the very few and neglectable bad things first - and please do NOT see them as a reason not to buy this game. It does not in any way ruin the experience, and I'm pretty sure it will be fixed with a simple patch:
- The game has a few bugs. Sometimes a battery you put into something suddenly sticks out again, or an animation might not play right away (example: ""wake someone up"" - when said character is not yet shown as sleeping, and then suddenly jumps to sleeping animation once interacted with).
- The side quest with the cube sats should have a clear warning that you can't ever find the first 5 cubes again once you left the station. Also, this side quest was not fun, it was tedious and annoying, especially when you don't want to miss the pretty cool audio logs that provide some nice backstory. It's optional though, and I recomment simply using a guide from youtube for that.

Now to the awesome stuff:
+First VR game with a compelling story and protagonists you really care about. You grow to like them and care for them very quickly, and the game has left me smiling or cuckling on many occasions, and on other occasions, terrified, because I feared losing ""my"" crewmembers. 
+Both Olivia and Jack seem very ""real"" and believable. Even though it is a SciFi Story it doesn't feel ""unreal"".
+The graphics are fantastic
+The developers managed to turn all the downsides of VR into actual features that enhance immersion - for example the awesome solutions for locomotion, or the fact that you are a robot, and thus have a ""digital display"" so the so called ""VR mesh"" feels like it's simply the camera tech of your ingame visor.
+The story is solid and feels finished with a great ending, while leaving space for potential sequels - without NEEDING sequels.
+The game starts out a bit slow, which gives you time to adapt and marvel at the scenery, before it accelerates and gets way more dramatic.
+Controls feel very natural and intuitive

All in all a must buy for SciFi Fans!","Feb 5, 2018 at 3:02 AM",4, 6,

I find it hard to go for more than an hour without having a cigarette break no matter what I'm doing, so when I finally emerged from this experience after 5 hours, I had to say, I was impressed. There's not much in this world that'll hold my attention for that long without the addiction dragging my concentration away.

I originally started with the free Echo Arena, and I was so impressed with the game mechanics and interactivity I decided I had to give Lone Echo a look, and I'm really glad I did. It has the most natural-feeling interactivity with the environment that I've ever experienced in any title, ever. Zero-gravity really is the best movement mechanic for VR, hands down.

The design and graphics and are beautiful - it's possible to just float around admiring the view for much of the time, and there are only a few parts in the story where the game presses you for time, so you can take your time to explore as much as you like. All the smallest details stand up to even the closest scrutiny.

The story is extremely engaging, as implied in my first paragraph, with a play-through time of 5-7 hours depending on your aptitude. I disagree with some here who say it's too short. I sometimes like a game with a definite beginning-middle-ending structure - similar to a movie or to a book that can be read in one sitting. The original Portal is another example of how a short-format game can work really well.

All-in-all, an amazing adventure with a great feeling of accomplishment at the end of it. I'm so glad that the storytelling has caught up with the tech-demo culture of VR, and I can't wait to see what comes next.","Dec 14, 2017 at 6:24 AM",5, 15,

You star off pretty slow as the game starts and gradually take more controll as you progress and while you progress you get imensly imersed by the characters making a masterpeice which even companys like Dice and EA faild to capture. this game invests you with the characters and makes you actually care about them.
ill admit the whole thing sorta doesnt make sense untill you reach the ending howerver.
the game has you running around doing little missions which on their own seem like chores but ones you realise the end game and reunite with your captain etc everything falls into place and makes sense.

if i could rate higher i would

4.5/5 controlls - can be cluncky sometimes otherwise are brilliant

I don't know whose concept this was, but if they get the notion to make a sequel, and it could be $100, if it possesses the kind of visual fidelity and presence this game has, I'll pay it without hesitation.

Gameplay: The zero-G movement mechanic is simply brilliant. Teleporting wouldn't have worked for this game. Oddly enough, neither would a gamepad. I love the feeling of pulling across and pushing against objects in space. They nailed this.

Story: Though it's not an excessively long story (and I haven't finished it yet) it is beyond engaging. You start to care about the characters - few though there are - and what happens to them.

All in all, this has to be the most surreal gaming experience I've ever had, but the money and time spent on this VR classic was entirely worth it. I'm ready for round two...","Jan 8, 2018 at 7:59 AM",5, 14,

Movement is almost perfect as I only felt a slight twinge of motion sickness maybe twice ever for a split second. Amazing accomplishment considering almost everything else uses a teleportation system or causes motion sickness with full motion.

I was going to give this 5 stars, but the middle and end of the game drag. Plus, there's no mapping system, so you can get lost occasionally and not know where all the missing objects are.

2022-05-28 11:48:25.575730,InsaneBase,Excellent Adventure,"If you are looking for a game that is making the best use of VR, this is it. 

Lone Echo is a  fine suspense thriller that lets you go to space with likeable characters that I could root for. 

More than once I wondered at the environments, gazed at the stars or rocketed around with the Vomit Comet (nice NASA reference, too) you can find.

The controls are mostly excellent, whether you drift across a room, handle tools or carry a box - sometimes items you grab act a bit wonky as they try to align with your hand. Which, amazingly, does feel like your hand, even though you are an android!

The game itself I would classify as a linear adventure, although the sense of agency you have is amazing, probably due to the relatable writing. The genre typical puzzles in this adventure repairing, assembling and operating various machinery.

I deduct one star because to me the puzzles were a bit on the too easy side, if not outright explained step-by-step. I wish there would have been a little more analyzing and thinking involved.

This does not take away from the overall experience, though! If there is a sequel, that maybe also clears Jack's side story, I simply hope this part will get improved.

The fact that I also share the same name as your VR character was a surreal experience and gave the whole story an extra level of gravitas I have not felt before. 

From a technical standpoint it is beautiful to look at even when playing on medium with my 1070.

The mechanics are really good, as are the graphics (on the whole) & voice acting. This (as well as Adrift) also gave me the sensation of zero gravity at times which was great. The problem is everything else is just so mundane. 

The story is average at best & the missions and training in particular felt like a chore. Gamers are used to repetition, but you literally do the same 3 things all the way through. Even in VR, the novelty quickly wears off.

To top that, after a couple of hours of perfect play I bumped all the settings to max, still no noticable slow downs or CPU issues, ROCK SOLID.
My CPU is water cooled, I did not get an idea on how the CPU was taxed but normally my machine under heavy load (Arma3) it will blow out some serious heat, this game was moderate.
The game itself, I am in story mode and can't put the controllers down, I am hooked.  The gameplay is fluid, mentally challanging and the graphics are out of this world (no pun intended).
I would buy it again, I would of bought it sooner if the game was not only tested on an Intel CPU, AMD works good for this game.

2022-05-28 11:49:27.178443,Shiroe_Arkstrom,Brilliant.,"A stunning example of good game design for VR. Dynamic functionality in 3D, zero gravity terrain in orbit around Saturn, capturing an absolutely STUNNING view. Optional objectives that pop up naturally along the story, a real sense of wonder and suspense leading up to an intense battle for life and death and a conclusion that feels good. This game wrapped up nicely, and brought with it a rather fantastic feeling of floating around in space with intuitive controls and simple but still enjoyable puzzles. Amongst all of the demo ""games"" out there for VR right now, this game is complete. I am content knowing I spent money on a game that isn't incomplete or just a tech demo.

It's a gripping story that just makes you want to keep going.

Gameplay is fun but the story and story telling is where this game really shines. I felt like I was actually playing as Jack and was emotionally connected with the outcome of the story.

I can't say enough good things about Lone Echo.  It's so polished,  and so immersive that I feel like I've achieved my childhood dream of going into space.  'Spectacular' just doesn't describe how awesome this game is,  where I'm hesitant to call it a 'game'  as it really feels like you've been transported to an alternate reality.  The closer you look at the environment,  the _better_ it looks.  From the little mechanical actuators in Jack's wrist,  to the signs, access hatches,  and fabric textures on Olivia's space suit.  When Olivia first glide/floats over to check on me/Jack,  I was overwhelmed at the sense of realism,  as if an actual person was eyeballing me up close.  It's such an awesome experience that after my first play through,  I didn't immediately hop in to start another game;  I want to let the details, sense of awe, and delight fade a bit so that I can be overjoyed again on my next play through.

CONS: Dubbing only in English with NO subtitles. It is a huge downturn for someone who can't understand English. Not having dialogues in such story driven game would be a shame. I remeber many instructions and/or advices I received just by audio when someone told me. This really requires me to listen all the time, understand properly and respond to what I am told.

There are also some minor technical glitches. I even experienced crash.

2. Soundtrack: Music plays in the menu and during the credits, and the rest of the game has none. All the dramatic and exciting moments were very underwhelming, because they had no music to solidify the effect.","Nov 9, 2017 at 9:39 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 11:50:22.486179,kuhne,Cons and Pros,"Cons. Glitchy, very glitchy, I had to download someone else's save file and do heavy trouble shooting in order to get past a specific part so that my game didn't crash. Oculus support, while nice, gave the good ol ""gotta reinstall windows"" canned response.

Repetitive, once the awe of VR goes away a bit you realize you are doing the same thing over and over and that you won't really enter a different phase of gameplay, it's just rinse and repeat.

Story. While the story is good, they either ran out of ideas or tried to play it smart for a sequel but it ends up being just cut short. It's understandable that you want to leave things unsaid for a sequel but they kind of went overboard here, you pretty much learn nothing of why this is happening and when you think you are about to find out, the game ends.

A little bit after halfway through the game you start messing with a substance that you are not supposed to touch or you die. This is used in a very smart way so that you have to be very careful on how to move around and use creative ways to get to another spot. Until you realize they are just going to keep using this until the game ends, it stops becoming a challenge and starts becoming tedious, the game's glitches don't help either, once I died and respawned 5 times in a row on top of the substance and kept dying and dying, I had to load a previous savefile.

PROS.

While the game is repetitive, it is by far the best game in VR so far, gameplay, story (what they do tell you) characters, etc.

Play area, while out in space, is not as impressive or immersive as you would like, it feels like a very small sandbox and you can pretty much see where everything ends. When you are inside ships, that's a whole new story, that's when this game shines, when you are inside a ship you really feel the scope of said spacecraft, it really feels like you are in a huge spaceship.

Heart, you can't make a game this engaging if you didn't pour every bit of your heart into it. Buy it!","Oct 3, 2017 at 6:52 AM",4, 3,

It's only the first thing I've played with them, too. For those of you that aren't yet sold on the concept of it, the entirety of this game is in microgravity. You traverse the environment by grabbing onto it and flinging yourself around. 

... strangely, I'm someone whose susceptible to motion sickness, and yet this game doesn't do it to me. Lucky's Tale? Vomit comet. Ripcoil? Disorienting and migraine-inducing. Even the railcar in Obduction will set me off, but this... Surprisingly, nothing. I don't know where they get that rating of ""moderate"" from. It's a decently solid game, with a strong story that actually had me a little emotional at one point. The main characters are well-written, the voice work is pretty good, the environment work is amazing, it's... good. This is a good game, and a proper game it is.

2022-05-28 11:50:35.471147,ediscaciate,A high water mark for VR,"The locomotion is amazing. At least for zero-G games this fells like a VR equivalent of the creation of WASD and mouse look by QUAKE players or the controls for 3D plataformers in Mario 64. It just fells right.

Caracter design, animation and voice acting are very effective in bringing the characters to life. I did care for their well-being. 

Awe inspiring settings, I spent many moments just floating and absorbing the experience. The graphics are beautiful (if your machine can handle it). If you don't enjoy contemplative experiences the sometimes slow pace of the game may be an issue. It was perfect for me. 

The only negative point I can think of is that I didn't enjoy the third act as much as the rest of the game. It's still good but not at the same level as the rest of the game. The actions and places start to feel repetitive. But this complaint pale in comparison to  all that this game does right.

TIP: If you already got your VR legs try playing with your caracter at an odd angle, it will add to sense of zero gravity. A little bit disorienting but thats the idea.","Jan 1, 2018 at 5:56 AM",5, 3,

Strip away the fact it's in VR, and the game is a collection of simple, repetitive tasks, that can probably only be enjoyable in a VR environment and would bore you to death in 2d....Even in VR the tasks become irritating at times, but it doesn't matter because so much else of this game is great.  The story of/relationship between the main characters is excellent; with a generous amount of sarcasm throughout.  I felt immersed in the game and although I became frustrated on occasion, the game didn't drag on too much.  It was easy to get involved in the game.  The entire game is very smooth, plays well, and the interaction with objects is fun.  I imagine that playing Lone Echo will make Echo Arena a lot easier in terms of controls.  I found a few issues, like getting stuck in the ground once (game-restart required), and a few very minor things, but I love that you can't ""go-through"" walls with your head etc like in most VR apps.

The story is simply great and needs to be played to fully appreciate it. You will without a doubt(as long as u have a pulse) become emotionally invested in these characters. (Sociopaths will not find this a good game either, so please exclude any of the Royals or ppl of that status) =p


I dont want to say much except that if u have  a good gaming rig then you will enjoy this all the more ... I just played it again on my a gaming rig I just built that has a Ryzen 1800 & 16gb 3200mhz ram along with a *1080ti that I got for a great deal *(only reason I would ever buy thew top end, as it is never not worth your dollar per performance %--I digress ,sry. I played it the first time on a good but older system that I still have  XfX 290x with 16gb ram & quad core intel @ 4.5 ghz. The new comp made it silky smooth every frame but both played it excellent.
As far as price goes, this title is worth every penny considering most people pay to go to a movie for max 3 hrs of entertainnment and spend more than 40 bucks, this you will be part of the entertainment and depending if you explore the game can last 15+ hrs but for most 10 hrs is likely. 
The only negative I can give it is a few of the quests that you do seem tedious and can become fustrating if it wasnt for the vr aspect making them even not bad cause you are fully involved in the experience. This game has set a new standard for me in single player games on/in VR. It is a must buy if there ever was one. Do yourself a favor and go enjoy one of the best games reguardless of VR. It is that good.
It should be game of the year in VR imho.

The developers though are missing some staff, like a musician and a scenario writer. Because there is absolutely no music. I can already hear ""its space, its quiet"", yeah right that bull. Go play some other space games and you will see how much feeling a good music can give in a space game. Also the story of the game is soo booorrrriiinggggg! Seriously its one of the most boring games i have ever played. No thrilling scenes at all. The only good scene is the one you see at the trailer. There was so much potential in this game, you could have made so many good scenes, but no. You didnt even steal some good thrilling scenes from othe pc space games. There are so many out there!

I've never witnessed/experienced anything quite like this. Where on earth do I start?? The graphics are astounding, the movement is fluid, original and responsive, the gameplay is deep and immersive, the interaction is frighteningly 'real'. You actually feel as if you are talking to a real person when dealing with 'Olivia', she reacts just the way a real person would. If you bump into her she complains with a witty or sudden remark, if you stand too close she'll say something like, 'personal space thank you Jack'!. Further to the mention of witty, theres plenty of subtle humour along the way, I smiled a few times so far, Olivia seems very fond of her robotic companion, Jack (you). You are taught how to interact and control 'Jack' along the way with well placed tutorials. Good use is made of each button and trigger on the hand controllers, on that subject, this is the first game I've seen where the shoulders and upper arms are in view. Adding to this, you can also see your robotic body if you look down, such attention to detail will add to what is already a breathtaking experience. I havent even skimmed the surface with this review, so you best hurry along and purchase this masterpiece, I guarantee you wont be disappointed. Well done to the Devs and Oculus, youve surpassed all my expectations, thank you.","Jul 21, 2017 at 10:47 PM",5, 36,

2022-05-28 11:50:58.159366,delevero,Amazing,"This was my very first game i tried on Ocolus Rift with the new controllers, and wow what an experience.. The first time I saw my hands in front of me they perfectly replaced my real hands and when i moved them I looked like I had mechanical arms..
I was super impressed by how realistic and beautifull it look ( for a vr title ) and movement is smooth and easy, and pretty cool to use your hands in 0 G to move your self arround.. As the game goes by you unlock new skills such as plasma cutting stuff open, and get bigger jets pack, light in your helmet and so on...   The main female character I found to be rather attractive, and well if this had been an xxx title i would really have a great time touching her here and there and enjoying the view.....BUT i was rejected, and even kicked by her, but at least I could do what I wanted just had to wait for her to look out the window and then i was ready ha ha  ;-)     well what i want to say is, she is very realistic and you feel a connection...   I also really love how the controlres work and how you talk and how your pull out different tools from your arm by sliding a wrist band and such things.. it is cool and look good and is initaturative. ..   So far i played 1-2 houres and om outside of the ship. I find it a bit hard to navigate and find the places i need to go but I get there eventualy.. Also sometimes it can take some time to figure out what it is the game want you to do.. Sometimes you almost give up and then you scan the right panel and you finaly get an option to talk with the woman and advance.. well i guess it all give meaning, just need to figure out how the game work..

I have to stop every 30 minutes or so since I start to sweat and feel a bit strange from all the motion that goes on... But one reason is that i did not figure out i could actual rotate my caracter with the right control stick rather than turn arround my self all the time this help allot..

2022-05-28 11:50:58.192278,lunaticedit,"Better than the others, but not great","First off, I played through the entire game, so I've gotten the full experience. I can say that within the first hour of the game, you've experienced most of the mechanics that will be in the entire game. There were several times near the end when I thought ""Man, if they just did X, this could be the next metroid"", but they didn't. Ultimately, this is a (beautiful, yet generic) VR puzzle game consisting of cutting things, placing things in other things, avoiding small round things, and not going to radiated areas for too long, with some VERY minor shooting involved. The story is interesting, but ends abruptly without further details. I had a decent amount of fun, but there's no reason to play it again.","Aug 31, 2017 at 2:33 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 11:50:58.225695,RKrogh,"This is no game, it's an experience.","By far the best VR-experience released to date. If you are looking for an amazing journey rather than a game-like demo, you should give this a try. Movement in zero gravity eliminates nausea brilliantly. The story takes me through a series of emotions and reactions I did not expect from myself. Voice acting is great and the level of detail in the visuals are stunning. Mapping of the body and its movement is stimulating to experience and gives a much more real sensation than most other games I've tried. Especially when it comes to all the different kinds of interactions you can do with your virtual body. If every game from this point takes a lesson from Lone Echo, Virtual Reality itself has gained a lot. Great work, Ready at Dawn Studios!

I can find nothing to complain about and the only reviews I've seen giving bad grades are people not giving it a try because it doesn't come in Spanish, which in turn is unfair to the game. It is not like I walk around expecting games to be released in my mother tongue, that would've been retarded, both by me and whoever in the industry that decided on such a bad decision. So instead of shooting down a masterpiece like this, learn English. It is 2017 and the age of IT does come with one particular language up front.","Oct 1, 2017 at 2:09 AM",5, 1,

I am a gamer since 20 years. I played A LOT. And honestly: if u rate this game just for what it is, how it is done, how its mechanics work, how athmospheric it is by its story and the narrative ideas.. this game is not that good at all. VR is definitely incredible, but if you dont mix things up - VR's immersion and this game as what it is - this is never more than a mediocre, small push buttons game. Two things i wanna add: the feeling it gives u to be outta space is strong, i personally disliked it - it was kind of nerve wrecking so that i did not like the experience alltogether. The other thing is, that when i played it, i had several bad glitches, where my hands and arms were not functional and outta place.","Oct 2, 2017 at 2:03 AM",1, 7,

I really hope everyone in the gaming industry plays it, it's the kind of content I've been waiting for. I remember looking at the Robinson The Journey art and trailer and imagining something with this level of interaction, polish, and convincing environments.

Some day we will be able to travel with a group of friends going to large highly detailed planets and worlds experiencing all kinds of conflict and wonder. Lone Echo has set up the first of many stepping stones to get there so I'm really impressed.

Lone Echo felt real in a way a Hollywood sci-fi movies usually don't. It has respect for it's plot and characters. The dialogue was given attention and the early interactions are pretty well done. TBH they probably needed one more act between the first and second half of the game or maybe put in some weird awkward bits of interacting with other units so you realize how much you level of AI is welcomed by her. The other small issue that would have been fine is a bit more of a soundtrack for when key events take place, but the sounds are well done. They nailed the pacing in the first half, but there really didn't feel like there was a moment to breathe in the second half.

In other words, the story and the events in the game will keep you playing for as long as you're physically comfortable doing.

The mechanics behind the movement are awesome, it really allows for a good immersion experience.  The plot line is excellent, it flexs ones problem solving skills pretty much throughout the entire game, and if something isn't clicking theres a conversation option somewhere nearby that will point you in the right direction.

Sensor and laser functionality are on point, furthering the immersion experiance, making you forget that you're just holding touch controllers.

And as far as that one thing goes, its really small but would make a pretty big difference to me in one part of the game.  The movement is awesome, although in the section (possible spoiler) where I'm first navigating through the unknown vessel, I'm using random floating metal debris, essentially as a tennis racket, to bat the orbs out of my way.  At first, it was going well, but the longer I attempted to hold on to a random piece of space metal, the more it started glitching out and making my whole arm go into robot seizures, ultimately it extends faaaar outside of normal reach and touchs the biomass, equaling death.

Locomotion system works great. Once I got used to it, I really bought into the feeling of being weightless and floating in space.

2022-05-28 11:51:20.979170,GoFlyUTR,Lone Echo is the VR app of the century!,"Lone Echo is, in a word, ""breathtaking.""  I could say more, but my thesaurus would run out of adjectives.  This is not a game.  It's not an experience.  You are simply stepping into another reality.  The bar is now set unfairly high for all other VR developers.

Where to begin ... the graphics are photorealistic; the dialogue has the quality of a Hollywood script; there is so much attention to detail in every respect.  This is a case study in, ""little things matter.""  When you are interacting with Olivia (your human counterpart on the space station), she has perfect awareness of your presence.  Her eyes shift to you whenever you are speaking (whether you are above, below, left, right, etc.).  You always feel like you both have vital roles in what's going on.  The jobs that you perform are so convincing that it suspends all disbelief.

I could go on and on, but I want to immerse myself back into Lone Echo.  This review is taking valuable time away from a most amazing experience.  I have dozens of VR games, apps, and experiences ... nothing touches Lone Echo.

If everyone in the world would play Lone Echo for just five minutes, everyone would own an Oculus.

This achievement deserves more than five stars!

Note: When I launch the game, I always receive a message stating that my rig is insufficient (lack of the right minimum ""instruction set"").  I just click ""okay"" ... and then Lone Echo runs silky smooth.  Not sure what that's about.  Old rigs work just fine if they have a new graphics card, tons of memory, and an SSD drive!  In any case, my sincere thanks to the development team for all of their hard work!!!","Jul 23, 2017 at 8:24 AM",5, 18,

2022-05-28 11:51:21.052973,Dakor,+Very high quality and worth it (-bugs),"This game has very high quality Assets, including models, animations and voice overs. While I was afraid that the game would only offer repetitive ""space mechanic""-style missions at the beginning, the story quickly drifted away from the ""protocol"" and hooked me. The dialogue system works very well and I felt sympathy for the virtual characters. The dialogs are well written as well. I played it standing with room-scale, but during the game I often forgot I was not weightless, I was totally in on that space station!
The game length is good, there aren't many different gameplay mechanics but the game ends before it gets repetitive and the story makes up for that. I played it in 3 sessions with about 3 hrs each, which equals in 9hrs of good and high quality gameplay. The only design flaw i noticed was, that you don't know when you reached a savepoint, which let to loosing a few minutes of progress when I ended a session.
I only give 4 Stars, though, because I experienced some major bugs:
- It crashed once during the first 30 minutes
- After dying, I was respawning in a deadly situation (outside a pod). I then re-centered and then wasn't able to leave the pod. (Handle animation wouldn't come)
- Liv once disappeared during a ferry scene, later in the game and reappeared when we reached our target
- In the pre-last chapter I had major FPS drops (below 45 FPS). Reducing the graphic settings didn't help. It was fine before and after that chapter (didn't try to restart because of unknwon savepoints)
- Physic glitches every now and then","Sep 12, 2017 at 3:15 AM",4, 6,

2022-05-28 11:51:24.290461,zerotronic,A VR Masterpiece.,"THIS is what we all hoped VR games would be like. Top quality visuals, story, characters,  controls, sound, music... everything. It's all there, and it's beautiful. I want everyone I know and care about to play this game, to see what I saw, and feel what I felt. The awe you feel playing this game can not be overstated. The environments are a wonderful mix of massive open spaces and cramped vents, corridors, and rooms. Everything is believable yet wonderous. This is a must have game for anyone with a Rift + Touch controllers.

The game took about 12-15 hours for me to complete. I have two cameras and it was enough to play the game without much issues. Very occasionally, I'd be pointing in the worst possible direction IRL and my hands would spaz a bit. The Right thumb stick (rotate in-game) makes it super easy to compensate when combined with RL rotation. It's easier to pick up than it sounds. TL;DR: You do not need a third camera to play and love this game. For me, ~80-90% of my arc was good with 2 cams.

Further, my play space is only 3 ft x 3 ft, and it was more than enough.

In retrospect, I think part of why the controls of this game work so well is that the entire game plays in zero G, and legs are not used at all. You can grab pretty much anything with your hands and navigate yourself with ease. You also have hand thrusters, which you'll us constantly to orient yourself when you're not able to grab something. It's a perfect scenario for VR interfaces today, and works brilliantly.","Aug 14, 2017 at 2:48 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 11:51:24.324370,javerlaw,Best VR Experience,"Haven't finished it yet but I'm fairly deep into the story and it's been an incredible VR experience so far. Controls feel pretty much perfect and really help with the feeling of immersion into the game world. The plot is also engaging with the dialog and characters feeling fleshed out and complete. Graphics are quite good as well...no VR graphics are on par with the resolution of a 2D screen with maxed graphics but this is easy on the eyes and has several wow moments which the graphics bring you into the world very well.

The feeling and control of moving through a weightless environment is stunning and the controls really tie into this form of movment perfectly.

Then there is the added multiplayer Echo Arena gameplay which I've only dabbled in a bit but it was one of the most intense VR experiences with a very good concept for simple but engaging multiplayer gameplay. Looking to the future if this is added to with more arena options in the future then it will only get even better!

I would recommend this game to everyone and it makes a great showcase to bring newcomers into the entire VR experience.","Sep 4, 2017 at 11:51 PM",5, 8,

The feeling I got from playing around with Half-Life 2's physics for the first time over a decade and a half ago is the same wonderment I experienced once I grasped this game's mechanics and zero-gravity locomotion.

The learning curve of moving through the game was little and I never ever got any motion sickness.   This game for me is the standard by which I am comparing all future games.   The interaction with in-game menus, buttons, controls, and items were flawless.  (does take some practice).  Storyline was good.   I did get stuck a couple times with finding solutions or knowing where to go, but you have to listen and make sure you check your objectives and also report when you are near an objective.   Not 100% intutive but you will figure it out.    I have started round 2 and it is just as much fun or more since I know I know where  I am going/doing.

Moving and acting feels very natural because of very well designed controls. Also the interaction with another character in the game (Olivia) is done very well and adds a good portion of humor. The surroundings are just great and the size relations transport well. It is a real space adventure. These aspects increase the immersion dramatically.

The only downside is that the gameplay does not vary a lot and basically you end up doing the same things over and over. But this also holds for nearly every shooter (which this game is none of). The interesting story keeps you going.

Regarding motion sickness I was surprised. There is nearly none. Though the movement is continuosly (snap turn though... can be deactivated, I think). I could play for hours without problems.

2022-05-28 11:51:34.129493,CR4FT,The VR Game You Never Knew You Wanted,"Lone Echo is a wonderful game full of craftmanship, love and care.  It really exemplifies the strengths of the VR experience, and invites and inspires the player to lose themselves in a virtual reality.  It's an experience that must be felt to really understand and appreciate.

From the moment you first put on a VR headset there's a sense of awe and excitement for the future of this technology.  It's hard to not get lost in thoughts surrounding the possibilities for what VR can offer.  Whether it's educational, creative, or just plain fun, this emerging medium has just begun to scratch the surface of potential.

Lone Echo is an experience that will allow your senses to fully realize what VR at its best can really be for the user.  The story, for all its faults, it captivating and well-told.  The characters are interesting and have a depth and weight to them that most games lack.  The art and design are extraordinarily well-crafted.  The UI and gameplay feel incredibly natural and intuitive throughout most of the playthrough.  

To put it bluntly, this is the first game with a full-price price tag that I can wholeheartedly recommend to every game lover.  It's not the high-octane adrenaline-pumping experience that many gamers crave, but it's the best game of its generation that's currently available.  It would be a shame to miss out on playing it, and, in my opinion, it's worth showing Ready at Dawn the financial support just to show companies that there is a market for high-quality AAA budgeted VR experiences.

Blown away by it would be my worst reaction, impressed as all-hell would be the best. I bought Lone Echo on the strength of the Arena game and was certainly not dissappointed by a game which gave me an unprecedented level of immersion and reality. Exploring the station, and the thing what turns up to ruin everyones day (no spoliers here :P) was amazing .. I felt like an actual explorer .. not just playing a game, and mashing the 'use' button on things. What impressed me the most was that I became totally emotionally invested in the character, and with Liv, and I was feeling every emotion possible when Liv was in danger.

Typically you want to survive in a game just to get to the end and complete the quest with the highest score .. but this game felt so much more personal than that. A BRILLIANT experience and worth every dollar I dropped for this bad boy and I'm so into a sequel.

I f developers can come up with interesting, stories, characters and visuals like LONE ECHO then this VR gaming concept can only get better and is a glimpse into the future! If you own an Oculus. You must own this title for it, and well done to the developer for an entry price of £30.00 A fair price for a great game.","Sep 1, 2017 at 8:25 AM",5, 5,

I have trouble paying that much money for a game that may be another ""concept"" or ""experience"" type game with very little substance underneith.

In my honest opinion Lone Echo puts every other oculus title to shame on so many levels. I really hope this game gets a sequel. The only bad thing that I can say about this game is that the ending leaves you with more questions than answers, it felt unfinished.

The gameplay in Lone Echo, the pacing, the ambiance, everything works great in VR. My only true complaint is that the Options did not save.

The feel and the movement through the game may be linear but it lets you make your own movements and choices to get there.  Hours on end wearing my gear trying to get through.  You feel as if you are there not just in some shooting gallery but in an enviroment that you actually need to work with, touch and push off of as well as push away from you.","Jul 24, 2017 at 11:52 AM",5, 5,

Sorry but the game looks great the sound and voice acting is good and the story is good but how can I know. I can't even pass an hour with out saying O god no no no please stop please stop and it just kills the game for me. I gave this game a 4 because it looks great and looks like devs care about it but story i can't tell you that and i don't wan't hurt a game for my weakness. I play this game for an hour and have sit for two hours with me feel like sh*t. People say it goes away with time I had a vr for year it does not. It a major issue and this totaly not way to go. I will never show this game to a friend who want to hurt their friends like this try out the system for the first time because it wrong so wrong. I don't want them to get sick and just hurts vr. I just want the devs to read and know next time please don't do this if they make another game or title and look at this see this not the answer to vr. To the devs please no more pain to the gamers. Why would you want hurt me I don't hate you guys I don't want hurt you. I just don't understand its system breaker and will destory vr. I want vr to grow and get good but how can it when it hurts the gamers just to play it. I just want to relax and have fun and that what games are made for and this just hurts. This is warning to other players like me you will get sick and if brave enough take it head on I wish you luck but I telling you. It not right paying money that makes you feel like this it hurts and vr. When devs must of known it will have effects on us how can they not know. its sad probbly a great game but I bet I never be able finish it and might have to watch a lets play. When I have the game in my computer and I paid money for it just not right man. 
p.s Yes I wrote this feeling vr sickness and I still do and yes maybe little hate but dam its the truth and that the best thing for you devs to see it a system breaker please keep in mind for next game thank you","Nov 10, 2017 at 4:49 AM",4, 4,

I was excited to try one of the latest vr games to see where this industry is going. the close to far graphic changes are VERY visible even in higher graphics modes so i give this a 8/10 graphically, some very exceptional up close detail and good overall effects. The story is fantastic, if you are a fan of star trek or other sci fi genre stories you will love this game. 9/10 for story. There is only one factor that is overall the reason i wont recommend this game to my buddies unless they are looking for a good detailed view in VR. Compared to PS3 games from more than 5 years ago that have great graphics and plots, this game fails to deliver more then a few evenings of challenge, the story is only about half a day long and I completed most of the find everything sequences I ran into.

2022-05-28 11:52:42.467720,NQVR1991,,"First thought was: Wow that was really - really good! I hope there is a sequel.
I had a DK2 for a couple years and had the CV1 since it was released. Over that time, from the tech demos on Oculus Share to the great free launch content, this game was what I had always been waiting for in VR.
VR multiplayer is fantastic and I've had some great fun there with others, mainly Dead and Buried + Holograms Against Humanity on Altspace, Echo Arena and more. But more often than not I do prefer to play a good fleshed out story driven game, alone and not have to talk to others. There hasn't been too much of this as yet until Lone Echo, and I couldn't recommend it highly enough.
I thought the twists and the story was great. I have most of the software that is out there for VR and it hasn't been since Edge of Nowhere, that I was so keen to get up in the morning and go straight back into VR to continue. I took my time with Lone Echo and I think I did maybe 5 or 6 - 2 hour sittings each day. Loved the impressive hands, interactions and the environments where amazing. I would find myself standing on the ship looking out the window at Saturn, and thinking 'Wow, so this is what it's like to be on a ship like this'. It felt so real and believable.
All this brought it to a whole new level of immersion. I'd also like to note the price point of £29.99 I felt was spot on, and very good value.
Only thing negative I found, was sometimes I would get a new task and I would find it quite difficult to fully understand where I should be going next. I did find myself spending longer than I would have liked activating - deactivating way points in the hope I could figure where to go. Most of the time this wasn't an issue though.
I was really glad I stuck with it though, brilliant game and it was surreal in a way feeling like you're getting to know a character (Liv Rhodes) in VR, even though they don't actually exist.
Well done to everyone involved!","Aug 10, 2017 at 2:00 AM",5, 7,

I remember that trip to Epcot Center my parents took me to in the early 90s, there was an early VR experience then, & I spent mid 90s summers saving up for PC hardware to mimic the VR or 3D experience. The films that depicted it weren't great, but I ate them up. Johnny Mnemonic, Lawnmower Man, that weird Denzel & Crowe film... I never thought the experiences depicted in those works would be captured in my lifetime. While there are some great VR experiences here that aren't horde mode shooters (check out Mage's Tale fantasy RPG fans) this is it... this does it. Killer App, dream come true. 
That said, as per this universe, I want to see & explore more of it. Lone Echo establishes the Echo Arena sport, and my gut tells mere there is more to tell. Much more.

I know a few people had problems downloading initialy but by 7pm (UK Time(GMT)) the download worked fine but it would have been nice to have a preload. Equally, Oculus might want to consider giving a release time & date rather than just a release date.

The way you interact with the environment and others is the best I've ever seen in VR.  BUT - their are CTD bugs that mean I cannot progress past a certain point (the bit where you go for an EVA through the airlock).  The recent patch which states to fix this bug doesn't do the job.  So, on one hand incredible game, on the other hand I can't play much of it, so it is more of a very very expensive demo at the moment - hence the score.","Jul 23, 2017 at 4:58 PM",3, 3,

2022-05-28 11:53:11.936538,Baxter900,Awesome,"Haven't gotten through the game yet (I'm guessing I'm halfway through, but idk), but it's an excellent game so far. It's almost all exploration and story, but it's crafted extremely well. Avoiding environmental hazards is a blast, the environment is toned well to be unnerving (or comfortable) as the game needs, but not so much that those who hate horror games would feel the need to stop. The puzzles in the game are excellently designed, usually being completely puzzling until you figure it out, then being obvious (I can't talk much about why they're so clever without spoilers).

My only complaint is that the game defaulted to high quality, and while it ran fine at that quality for the majority of the time, I had to knock it down to low to prevent the game from crashing in certain places. The devs though assure me that these issues are their top priority.

All in all, an amazing game, quite possibly unique across what I'm seen in VR so far. It's story based with free locomotion, has active sequences that make you feel like an action hero without any combat, has unparalleled freedom of movement and exploration, and well designed puzzles. All in all, currently my favorite singleplayer VR game.","Jul 21, 2017 at 7:44 AM",5, 3,

But surprisingly the game was actually pretty amazing. However I would suggest getting a beefy PC because, I thought my pc could run everything but the frames in this would drop hardcore and that really sucks in vr. Other than that, the story was awesome, and the movement was amazing, the gameplay was pretty good and yeah, all around a really good VR game. I do have a few cons though, this game feels really short, and not because it is, the game is probably about 7 hours, but the way it ends makes the game feel like a sneeze that never happened. And the other thing is that I crashed multiple times for no real reason. But still, this is a must have for VR players!","Jul 31, 2017 at 11:53 AM",5, 3,

You will feel like a helper in a space station filled to the brim with a lot of small details and interactive spaces.  Excellent dialog interface too.  Main downside is I have a small space for VR and the use of hands to navigate through the environment does get me turned around a lot.  A third sensor I think is ideal but even if I did have one I do think you could get tangled up with the helmet cord.  Beyond that though this is about as advanced as it gets.

2022-05-28 11:54:01.067581,Sir_Diggins,The best to date!,"I will start off with this review by not talking about the game directly, but comparing it to other games. The first thing I can think to say is that the production value of Lone Echo is insane. The only game that came close to it is Robo Recall. The difference between the two is that LE actual has a story which is very enjoyable unlike RR, which is just constant shooting of things. That being said they are both great games. What is fantastic about LE is that it is a full on AAA title. The problem we've had up until this point in the history of VR games is there was nothing that truly felt like a game you can play on a 2D screen. There have been fun games, don't get me wrong, such as Job Simulator but they have all been fairly experimental, for the most part short, experiences. Now, lets get onto specifics. I'm going to start by talking about the most important part, gameplay. This game is filled with content. The story up to the part I have played, is excellent. It  is said to be about 4 hours long, but I'm already about 2 hours in and have barely scratched the surface due to all the things to see and play with, and some difficult puzzles. Some parts of it might be a bit tough to figure out at first and I think because of that it will easily make it last 6+ hours. In regards to the way the story works, its great. You are a robot who is helping out your captain, and the interations between them is perfectly done, It makes you feel like your character and the captain have known each other for years. As I said, some of the tasks are a bit difficult and it might take you some time to complete, but once you have you feel proud of yourself for having done it.
As for the actual gameplay and experience, you will need a beast of a computer. I have it on low settings just to get a playable framerate. I personally have 32 GB of ram which helps, but I'm mainly limited to my graphics card not being that powerful. That being said, even on low settings the game looks great!","Jul 24, 2017 at 9:11 AM",5, 3,

Teleporting is a cheap mechanic done in other games that, while it works, does disrupt the flow and just doesn't feel real.

The game clocks in at about 6 hours, and it only follows a single narrative (a good narrative, but with no real branching).  Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed the game.  If a sequel is made, I'd love to see a branching storyline and more ways to form relationships, and a little more action and variety in terms of organisms that you experience.

The second half has some good moments, horrifically carved up by the tedious process of getting from one place to the next in an uninteresting and repetitive environment.

It lacks all the detail found in the first half, seemingly to try and keep you in suspense about the origin of what you've found - which turned out to pretty much be my first guess of what it was, as it's such a hackneyed sci-fi trope.

There are (when I played it and despite one patch) some bothersome technical issues. Obvious slowdowns when transitioning between areas, and the odd framerate issue that just seemed out of place were mildly annoying, though I didn't get entire crashes that some people reported.

Saying all that, the first half of the game is so good, it's worth the money (and there' Echo Area to jump into as well for those that are bothered about multiplayer Frisbee). The lack of pacing and detail in the second half turns what should be an essential masterpiece into ""merely"" an excellent title. Game of the year? No - but it could have been.","Jul 27, 2017 at 5:05 PM",4, 1,

I pre-ordered (and patiently waited to receive my confirmation email then downloaded properly with no issue) and I don't regret it.  I rarely pre-order games but this was a must after playing the free weekends of Arena.  I think that strategy paid off, marketing team.  Well done.

My *only* concern was the ending.  No spoilers, but...  While the story was totally engaging throughout, and the voice acting top-notch, I felt the end was abrupt/rushed.  I like how the story itself ended, I just felt it could've extrapolated a few more touching moments and dialogue to tie everything together.  It was almost like - ok, we're here - roll credits.

Other than that - amazing game, BUY IT NOW!","Jul 23, 2017 at 4:15 AM",5, 1,

The game runs very well at mid/high settings on my  I7 and overclocked 970GT. The attention to detail is stunning with superior voice acting and graphics. The size and scale of the space station, satelites, and mining facilities is phenominal; you literally feel that you are among the Rings of Saturn with the stunning planet in the background. The length of game is dependent on how you play it; for my purposes, the gameworld and experience is so stunning, I've played 8 hours and barely touched the main missions. I spent an hour or two floating around a satelitte and soon found it was an optional mission to repair it. It is also very rewarding and mellow, just floating around and exploring. Ready at Dawn are to be commended for the quintessential VR immersive experience. There is so much potential in this type of setting and locomotion. I find myself dreaming of a Halo type game where you are master chief in weightless enviroment and can go guns blazing. so too multiplayer shooter. the possibilities of VR are endless, it's clear why Valve and Facebook are all in.

Settings default to medium and it looks stunning.  I can't imagine what taking it up to ultra would bring.  It's smooth and detailed.  The movement is polished and feels natural and right.  The immersion is benchmark for VR.  The integration of menus and gameplay into the hands and environment takes you away and you forget you are in a game.  This is truly an accomplishment.

2022-05-28 11:54:36.953042,Stinkys,A 5 star game with a few temporary bugs,"This is absolutely a 5 star virtual reality game; and precisely what the community & industry needed.

The environments are extremely detailed and offer a lot of freedom, the story and voice acting is top tier and the game-play was challenging enough on my first play-through to keep me engaged and not become bored. It's pretty rare for me to finish a game and pretty rare that I feel this satisfied from a VR title. I will definitely be playing the story through again.
The locomotion system is ingenious and felt natural throughout the entire story. You can sit down and play from your office or the couch, but the game does shine when you have a moderate standing play area with 360 tracking.
Unfortunately for me, I did have quite a few crashes (version 3.89) in airlocks and high action scenes which was extremely jarring and somewhat broke the experience. After speaking with RAD developers on Discord it appears that they are aware and are working the problems. I was able to improve my experience by reducing texture detail to the lowest setting while still leaving everything else on high.
Overall a highly recommended purchase for anyone with a VR headset.","Jul 23, 2017 at 2:40 PM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 11:54:37.028839,Boredpirate,VR With A Soul,"Yes, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is consistantly enjoyable, and the motion is fluid and graceful without causing sickness, but the joy of Lone Echo is the relationship between Capt. Olivia (Liv) and her AI assistant Jack (you). The human connection you form together - YOU form together, not the characters form with each other - is almost unmatched by any other relationship in gaming. This is on level with the Witcher 3 in terms of emotional investment and realistic dialogue. 

Another incredible aspect of Lone Echo is how you can shape Jack through your dialogue choices. Does he remain steadfastly adherent to protocol, save for in the most dire of circumstances, or does Liv's habit of risky improvisation rub off on him? Does he understand humor? Would he adhere to his stated purpose forever, or would he - if the moment was right - define a better one? It's entirely up to you.

In terms of gameplay you'll get around 5-6 hours, depending on your speed. That's not much, true. But the quality is worth every penny. 

Graphics are top notch (my 1080ti is around 100% all the time). Sound is impressive (especially when you leave the station with all the machines and have total serenity in space), models are real life like. Atmosphere is beyond anything I've seen so far.

There are some fetch and repair quests, I like that. It's predictable and you can just relax and take in the atmosphere while doing them. And then you have chaotic situations where you have to act fast.

I prefer to have the excitement of taking enemies out at least somewhere in a game but in this game I didn't really miss it.

The good things are that you can actually see your arms instead of hands only. A really big thing for me, on top of that you get to see your body and legs once in a while which is a great bonus.

(for those whining weakasses:) You won't get sick in here(!) and it has no horror or scary parts. Just enough awe and excitement left though. Making it perfect for the whole family to enjoy this game.

2022-05-28 11:57:01.374228,J_Trill,"A Good ""Experience/Simple Platformer""","I enjoyed it. I think it was worth my $39.99. I used a 970 GTX so I did stutter quite a bit on settings low, but it was playable enough since I'm not sensitive to nausea in VR since low frames can cause that.

Anyways, it really reminded me of a Telltale game in the sense that you can say things that change responses, but in the end the story will be the same.

It starts off pretty cool since you're legit on a space station and it feels weird. It then gets kind of boring as you go around the space station doing chores. Afterwards, things get a little more interesting. However, there are not really puzzles. It is mainly pressing buttons or searching around for batteries. This isn't really a bad thing, but it's basically filler. However, in the sense of the narrative it makes sense as you repair or change the way stuff is working.

These more boring bits reminded me a bit of games like Job Simulator, where the tasks aren't that interesting and feel a bit like work. However, I know a lot of people like Job Simulator so it might be up your alley.

The real part of where it shines is the graphics (I assume, since I have a 970 and it's all at low to be playable) as well as the character development is pretty cool. I like the robot you are and I like the other characters and AIs. It really feels like you are in a movie...

I find the simple platformer something that is relevant since in certain segments you have to be quite precise with your boosts and grabs otherwise you have to start over. Those spots I didn't mind since it made me feel pressure to avoid them and more like a real game.

I'm usually not a guy who likes space games, but this really was super immersive. TLDR ----- The game is basically an adventure experience as if you are in a sci-fi movie yourself. It is very immersive, with characters, mo-cap, environments, graphics, but shallow on gameplay elements. However, it is still a great VR experience.","Aug 7, 2017 at 1:46 PM",4, 1,
