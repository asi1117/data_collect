2022-05-28 18:21:21.330513,martin.lee.167,Pricey but enjoyable,"Although the price is quite high. The quality of the game is really stunning. 
The 360 surroundings, the small details and the facial expressions done by the heroine was top notch.","Jan 30, 2021 at 12:33 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:21:21.345473,kevinlee7126,Feel it with your heart,"This was the first time I cried because of a game. I really felt the separation of the main character, not because she left me. In fact, things have happened to me because of the transfer, which reminds me of the past, and it is also one of the reasons I was cry. All in all, this was a very nice game, thank you developers for moving me once.","Feb 22, 2020 at 2:26 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:21:21.360433,draneas,No bang for the buck,"I know, making a game is not cheap. Programming, graphics, mocap, voice acting, all that stuff costs probably quite some money. But asking almost 24 Euros for about over an hour gameplay is a bit harsh.
Yes, I kinda enjoyed my time with Yua. She was cute and the japanese voice acting was well done. The photoshoots were decent. The writing and story were okay, I didn't expect much in that regard (guessing from the game description).
TLDR: A decently executed, cute virtual visual novel, but it's way too short for the harsh pricing.","Jul 8, 2019 at 8:15 AM",2, 56,
2022-05-28 18:21:21.375393,tojams,Makes Me Want More,"This was a very nice game.  The model was stunning and the settings were really well done.  The only think that kept this from being a 5 was the very short play time and the complete inability to physically interact with the character.  Call to all developers.  I think there should be much more of the dating sim genre available.  I wouldn't mind if they were in English either.  The Japanese is very nice, but English is just one step closer to realism.","Jul 9, 2019 at 1:15 PM",4, 15,
