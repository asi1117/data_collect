2022-05-28 11:25:34.417157,Enderknight113,BUY IT!!!!!,"This game is reaaaaaally good, if you want to do something that has no logical sense, you can do it. If you want to download mods (make sure to do the current update's mods because it wont work with older mods) you can do it. If you want to climb up a mountain for a better archer position, you can do it. This game is well crafted and really fun to play, in fact I can't stop playing. So, this game is just awesome, one warning is that it has no story so if you want a sword fighting game with a story, sadly this is not it, BUT it still is amazing with lots of updates and fixes as it is in early access. I could go on and on till the oculus app forces me to stop typing so to cut it in half, this game is very good, buy it right now!!!!!

update: game is no longer in early access but they have been adding some really cool stuff!",20 days ago,5, 37,
2022-05-28 11:25:34.434112,Shmoebagel,Endless Fun,"Better than ""AAA"" games by a whole hecking heck of a lot. Blade and Scorcery is without a doubt the game you'll spend the most time playing. Once you master fighting in VR it only gets more enjoyable. SOon enough you'll feel like some ""Chosen One"" capable of powering through any number of enemies. Easy to play, fun to master. _And even more fun once mastered. Mods make this game an easy 11/10.",19 days ago,5, 15,
2022-05-28 11:25:34.450069,DooDooDude,best combat sim on quest store.,"the main appeal for VR (in my opinion) is a full body, fun enemys, modding support, and glitches that just make the game funner. that being said, BLADE AND SORCERY SMASHES ALL OF THAT. the NPCs are kind of dumb, but that just makes this funner. Example: fall down a pit, whilest climbing out of said cliff, a woman screams bloody murder as she jumps down to try and persue me, proceeds to shatter her kneecaps, and dies. this game may not have as much texture quality as other combat games (boneworks or hellsplit arena, check both of those out btw) but it is probably the most active in a modding platform, recently one of my favorite modders got a job as a developer for this game, BUT ANYWAYS. 100000/10, bashed someones skull in with a hammer, BUY THIS GAME.",Apr 10 at 1:58 AM,5, 133,

Not to mention, the direction of their updates is truly promising. This means that people who own this game can always experience, or look forward to, new updates that add and optimize gameplay.
B&S, to put it simply, is fun as hell to play and even more fun with the wide arrange of community-crafted mods that enhance your experience, customizing your environments/playstyle.
If the mere thought of bashing people with intricately designed weapons and unique spells is appealing (unveiling your previously dormant psycho tendencies on poor NPCs), then this game is literally for you. 
B&S is, by far, one of my favorite VR games, without a doubt. 
**GET THIS GAME!!**",Apr 10 at 1:21 PM,5, 30,
