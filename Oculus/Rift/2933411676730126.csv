2022-05-28 19:58:08.009707,FIFA4life,The closest reality to shopping,I am a new VR user and I was looking for a fun experience. I got this app and It took me a little while to find out the controls. But I learned that I supposed to finish all tasks at the first level to unlock the new level. I was amazed by the mountain house level and I had a great experience shopping in a breathtaking location from the comfort of my home. I especially loved the shoes and handbags collections!,"Aug 23, 2020 at 12:58 AM",5, 0,
