2022-05-28 20:28:47.516496,kathleen.hanke.1,Nice effort,Educational content is hard to come by.  This experience is meant to make you empathize with others and realize that we all have come from somewhere else. It ends with sections of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Good effort. Please continue making thought provoking and educational content.,Jan 24 at 11:07 AM,4, 1,
2022-05-28 20:28:47.532453,price_kelley,A few issues,"As the headline describes, there are a few issues with this documentry, firstly the detail in the Mayflower herself is seriously lacking and it does feel that the ""agenda"" driven storyline overides the main attraction to the piece of software, so the first to note is the lack of detail in the ship, the bigger issue is the content, a preachy, left wing - pro migration stance has been applied to history once again, yes the outlook is correct and the moral is a good one, but the ""TRUMP wall"" depicted in the Syrian style concentration camp? IS A STEP TO FAR, let your users remind you that this same ICONIC landmark is now JOE BIDENS concentration camp, one swamped with children and life theatening illness, revise your content and perhaps add that whilst seeking a new life and often from danger should be and should always be done in the legal format, that immigrants should be accepted all around the world when they have arived legaly, there is no mention or statement about the dangers illegal movement or people trafficing let alone that it was even considered! Seriously.... what were you thinking (CRT?) - unbalanced and lacking, context, lacking and missing crucial parts of history between the Mayflower's arrival at the continent up to the vision of a modern border wall, lacking in historical key moments ivolving crew and captain. This needs to all be revised and soon, I am not surprised to say ""no wonder facebooks platform supports this"" - need I say more.","Jun 27, 2021 at 11:10 AM",2, 4,

2022-05-28 20:28:47.561375,Squid3958,Preachy and technically glitchy,"Content
The good - Someone made an attempt to tell a story that needs to be taught.
The bad - If you're going to tell an historical tale, maybe try to root it in actual history instead of the woke nonsense about mistreatment of the ""Noble Savage"".
Execution
The good - Some interesting use of visual graphics.
The bad - Horrible syncronization between the spoken narrative and what is seen in the event. Dramatic music over-rides most of the narrative and drowns out all but a few pieces. You can hear female voices saying something, but in most cases it is impossible to make out what they are actually saying except for a few words here and there.
Based on what can be heard from the male voices, this is not necessarily a bad thing, as it relieves you of the burden of having to sit through more preachy and shaming diatribe.

History lessons should be based on facts, favoring no particular point of view or personal philosophy. If one wishes to present personal opinions about our often sordid past, then it should be presented as an op ed piece and not try to masquerade as ""History"".

Good attempt in some ways, but clearly this is an unfinished and rough draft. It's free, and sometimes you do get what you pay for.","Apr 3, 2021 at 6:08 PM",2, 48,
2022-05-28 20:28:50.677172,Cullinarn,A New Experience Deserves a New Review,"Okay, so I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that the devs and I would not have productive conversations about history. This is... very preachy still. Seriously: Please remove the modernized wall; whether they agree with you or not, everyone gets what -- and whom -- you're talking about and the point would be more effective if it were less obvious. That said: I'm still going to give this five stars as an experience. ALL of the bugs have been fixed with the most recent update (Let's pause to consider that for a moment). The narrative is improved as a result. The narrative, whether you agree with it or not, is also complete and consistent in nature. The church scene at the beginning is still one of the best depictions of a church in VR I've seen. The sailing scene is brilliant precisely because you can tell these folks weren't focused on the ""rules"": action is all around you, and a significant amount of the action goes on behind you (Unless you turn your head significantly, you miss the timelapse moonset). And that's why I'm reviewing this for what it is: A good use of what I presume, according to the laws of the UK, is public money.

I'm reviewing this as an art project, not a history project, and on those merits it succeeds in every particular. The vocal/visual synchronization issue has been fixed. It has been fixed, as far as I could tell, entirely, and that was the biggest issue with the initial release. The text scrolling across the ground was a brilliant choice. The only change I would have made, were I attempting to tell the same narrative as the devs, would have been to show a deterioration of the Mayflower as the Plymoth Colony developed. That would require removing an obstruction, but I think it would add to the strength of the presentation. That said, for a free experience, I can safely say that there is nothing not to like. I might be annoyed occasionally, but this is a final product, and it's not even a product.","May 4, 2021 at 3:08 AM",5, 3,
