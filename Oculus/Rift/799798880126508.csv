I got it for the purpose of overcoming fear of flying based on the website they show a commercial airplane cabin seat next to a window. There are only 3 choices on this app Bees, Roaches, and Spiders.","Jun 19, 2021 at 5:46 AM",1, 10,
2022-05-28 16:02:01.351910,zbufferVR,It does help people with phobias,"Recently subjected a friend to this app, the gradual process and calm voice really helps.
If you or people around you are terrorized by spiders, cockroaches, ants/bees, try this.
I would really like having the voice in french, other than that, it is perfect !","Aug 25, 2018 at 8:57 PM",5, 12,

Yes, it is not meant to be a game. We tried to make it clear in the description and screenshots, etc, but some people still get confused."
2022-05-28 16:02:01.395793,neuro27,Fantastic Research Opportunities,"There is research being done on the potential for apps like these to act as exposure therapy for specific phobias. I would love to see data on how well this app actually works. If the data supports it, you could actually recommend using this in a psychiatric setting to desensitise people. For now, it's simply an interesting demo.","Jun 22, 2017 at 8:30 AM",4, 12,"Thank you! There has been a lot of research into VR exposure therapy, which is what we tried to base Fearless on. Yes, more research to be done!"
