I played the level twice and I couldn't advance to the next level. I was looking at steam forums and this bug is been there for like 2-3 years and the developers didn't fix that part yet.

On top of that there are many cases where it seems the game wants me to do something in order to progress but I end up having to wait like 3 to 5 minutes for the game to fix itself if it even does that. If it doesn't I have to restart the level. Fun shooting mechanics but feels very undercooked.","Mar 2, 2020 at 2:39 AM",3, 15,

2022-05-28 14:32:27.688209,Kornizkit,Zombie Kill Fest!,"This has been a real awesome ride!  This game had it all for me, great gun mechanics, it was super easy to holster guns and equipment, gore, zero motion sickness, horror, suspenseful fights, satisfying gameplay and sound, good story, and multiple endings.  I haven’t gotten to try the multiplayer yet, but I’m psyched to have my friends try it out with me.  This game was simply one of the best VR experiences that I have had since getting my Rift S.  My game time shows a total of 4 hours played time, but I assure you it was much longer than that.  I’d say closer to 10 hours or a little over (It was daylight when I put the headset on and everyone was asleep when I took it off).  

Would I recommend it:    Yes
What do I rate it:              5/5
Pros:                                Campaign is fun, easy controls, easy on the eyes, Suspense.
Cons:                               None.
Motion Sickness:             None.","Dec 31, 2019 at 2:21 AM",5, 4,

There are still minor bugs when stepping on elevated ground like rocks, wood, construction debri, etc.  I got stuck few times and couldn't move because of it and had to change it to teleportation for a sec to get out of it.

2022-05-28 14:32:30.789497,MattSamiA,Has full locomotion support!,"I cant believe I missed this game! I bought it in a bundle with Aspire1, Aspire 1 is ok 4 stars I guess, graphics arnt that great but the game is still very very good. I installed this game and it felt like old school locomotion. You can change that and its better then most if not all games out today. This is a horror game guys, graphics are amazing (like what you would see in a loco game that doesnt want you to get close to anything). Guns and knives look real (unlike games lately that DONT look real) looking at your pistal and firing reminds me of my very 1st VR days, the knife with the serated edge and the shine of steel looks so real (I miss the small details in new VR games). But seriously, this is a resident evil game. I was so surprised when I found I could change from teleport to full smoth movement, I love it. VR has started to move away from this because Idiots complain too much..... 5 stars, played 1 hour, love it. Played 50 hours asguards wrath, finished stormlandss and the graphics in this game are the same or better (sorry cant say the same about Aspire1, but its still a very good title). Like resident evil, love this game ;)

Update: Still fkn loving it!!!! I have no idea how this game isnt more 5 stars, yet summer land is hahahahaha. It's good. Definately Resident Evil but like Armitica but with full proper run around control. Man cut the small zombies hands and limbs off, watch them do nothing to you, its gorgeously beautiful! Sorry I didnt pay full price to support this game!!!!
ITS A REAL SHAME THE INTRO VIDEO IS NOTHING WHAT THE GAME IS LIKE. If you like any resident evil series this is the closest VR game ive found so far that is just like RE.  So glad id dint miss this

2022-05-28 14:32:30.849337,DarkoftheV,"This game was fun, however.....","I really, really wanted to like this game. I loved the original Killing Floor and was looking forward to playing. The first mission at the farm house was awesome, great atmosphere, alot of Zeds to kill, and that part where you have to find the code pieces in the house was genuinely stressful and nerve wracking. However, after that it started to go downhill for me. I don't mind the fact that they spawn in anywhere (sometimes right in front of you) but the fact that they are able to hit you before you can shoot them (At least in my case) is absurd. Zeds in my game also had the tendency to despawn then respawn behind me without making a sound. I don't know if it was intentional or an oversight but it really ticks me off when I'm fending of a horde of Zeds (knowing there is nothing behind me) then all of a sudden I'm being attacked from behind. I really wouldn't mind them spawing anywhere if they would at least give some kind of cue to where they will spawn, at least when fending off a horde. Like I said I really wanted to love this game (even more then Arizona Sunshine), and the first mission had my hopes up big time, but it just started to fall apart after that for me. But this is just my opinion.","Oct 18, 2019 at 2:08 AM",3, 4,

2022-05-28 14:32:34.004973,FastLawyer,Could have been great,"This could have been one of the best shooters in VR and even better than Arizona Sunshine. Unfortunately, the game is brought down by several bugs & a very short campaign (Horde mode isn't even worth talking about). This game has great atmosphere and it's very thrilling when you're in the dark and there's just several zombies coming at you from every corner and you're locked & loaded & ready to kick some zombie butt. This is pure arcade fun.

I finished the story mode in about 3 hours. I experienced several bugs along the way including falling through the world so that I had to quit and restart the game and also just being stuck in the level with nothing happening twice. There are several locomotion, graphics, sound, & graphic options. Game ran fine on my 1060 GTX. 

There are 3 really good boss fights. There really isn't much enemy variety though as most of the zombies act the same although they have different skins. You can 1 hand most 2 handed weapons and you can reload everything with a simple button press. All in all, I had fun but I also felt disappointment at the end. This could have been so much better.

The game have story mode you can play solo or with friends and, of course, survive mode with waves for solo/multiplayer as well. 
To be specific, i just put here positive and negatives sides of the game:
+++
- Good graphics
- Good optimization
- Usefull interface
- Very immersive and atmospheric
- Interesting story and story presentation
- Training included
- Very dynamics battles
- Interesting weapon mechanics
- Fun and simple quests/tasks
- Creepy monsters and bosses
- Overall solid and polished product

- - -
- The story mode is too short. Too. Short :)
- You cannot reset a progress (fresh start)
- Too limited weaponry
- Not large variety of monsters
- Some minor bugs

2022-05-28 14:32:43.497646,DamnYouKitty,Is this game dead?,"I bought this game sometime last year because I love Killing Floor 1 and 2. 
It is cool that you can finally play killing floor in VR...kind of.  You can play it but don't expect to get much out of it.  The weapons available are far less than the regular game and are stuck playing a campaign with up to 1 other player.
I have not been able to be matched with anyone since I first purchased this so generally I will start an online game and quit after 10-15 minutes.
Another thing that sucks is that you are not able to upgrade your character like in the other games.
If this game offered the same amazing experience I have come to expect from the non-VR Killing Floor games I would have given this 5 stars, instead I am giving a 2 star review to a terribly dissapointing game.","May 30, 2019 at 7:14 AM",2, 1,

Jankey in places, especially with regard to the free motion controls. You *will* get jammed on the scenery. It's not terrible, but it does detract from the experience.

Holsters are extrememly finicky and you'll drop your guns frequently. They teleport back to your holsters after a few seconds, but it's still a real pain (not to mention an immersion breaker.)

Throwing melee weapons appears to be more of a ""blue sky suggestion"" than an actual command, so don't expect your knife throws to be accurate. Landing a headshot with a thrown fire axe is surprisingly satisfying though.

Duel weilding pump action shotguns is totally cheating, but also completely awesome.

Shame about the lack of weapon variety. Coming from Killing Floor 2's awesome arsenal to this is a bit of a disappointment.

Nice visuals in general, but it could do with more blood and gore. I'd rather have slightly less detailed environments/textures and more strawberry jam splattered about the place. At least that way I feel like I'm making some kind of an impact on the environment.

The melee mechanics are easily abused but quite satisfying overall. I just wish there was more things I could hit the Zeds with. Fire extinguishers, plant pots, anything from the environment, really.

Having to ""holster"" (drop, really) the weapon in your hand to pick stuff up is a total pain. I'd rather pickup/use ammunition and medkits by running over them, just like you would in any other game. I mean this mechanic has been established in shooters for well over a decade now. There is a reason why we don't constantly stop the action to widdle about with pickups.

Not as good as the gold standard of VR shooters (Robo Recall) but has sparks of genius in there. I feel that with a little more polish this could have been awesome. As it stands it's just above average.

tried oculus no help after trying there looked at trip wire issue online not tried the few suggestion yet such as backing upmultiple files deleting retrying game etc and to be honest this is not an early access release so should not have too
BUY THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK you may find you get to play through even complete the single player game go past the auto refund policy and not get it to work again without alot of messin around yourself, FIX  THIS GAME

-Nice graphics and voicework
-Story mode and endless wave mode

Cons:
-Not much content, 5 chapters take 2-3 hours to get through
-Coop doesn't work with Steam/Oculus, only if both are on same platform
-The enemies spawn in behind you, right on top of you, inside/through walls, etc.  This one alone basically ruins the game by itself.  

Definately can't recommend this one at all, there are MUCH better VR zombie games out there (see: Dead Effect 2 VR and/or Arizona Sunshine).  Gave it 2 stars since it was functional and nice graphics.","May 17, 2019 at 11:25 AM",2, 0,

Classes, guns, customizable characters, challenge waves in survival/horde mode. I realize vr is still kind of new, and young. However, you have to go bigger, especially with such a blockbuster franchise. The gameplay is awesome on its own, but it becomes repetative very quickly. And kf incursion not supporting cross platform play was basically a self inflicted gunshot wound that's not gonna heal, because of how many players want to play coop but can't.

The visuals are rather nice, the sounds are all there, definitely feels like a Killing Floor game. But what makes it boring? For starters, this does NOT feature ANY of KF2's main aspect of the game: Wave Progression with different classes and perks with upgrades. No, this is a ""light"" story mode with linear levels are some puzzles to solve here and there. It also has a Hold-Out mode which is just endless waves of zeds versus you with one life. It becomes very repetative and boring with only 4-5 basic weapons. Don't expect any grenade launchers or chainsaws, no, you'll only get pistols, the knife (can be throwable), axe, katana, pump shotgun, and an AR gun. You'll get a few grenades but they are limited. I really was hoping this was just KF2 in VR but sadly it's more like to introduce those who've never played Killing Floor, and with the actualy Killing Floor 2 being the main attraction.

However the controlls are by far the worst part, ie. if you use the joysticks to move, dont do any turning of any sote near any walls or objets, you will get stuck in them, after which sometimes you can teleport out of the object or wall, but usually not. Usually, you ended up with no angel to actually teleport. If you are teleporting it doesn't work well either. Most of the gunplay is decent ( I didn't make it far enough to get explisives, had to quit and uninstall before I hurt myself trying to throw a controller) melee combat is iffy at best, and snipers are crap.

Note This game Should not be a comfortable rating in my eyes, moderate at the least 

Now for a bit longer of a review
If you enjoy KF and KF2 Then you'll more than likely enjoy the story aspect of this game plus holdout is pretty fun but nowhere near the level of the original games
The game itself plays well Bar the grenade pouch which i had issues with (it being the way was the main problem) 
The game is made up of 5 story missions with a bit of length to them but the fun comes in with Hardcore mode which bumps the difficulty up a fair bit. extending the game time if you choose though I didnt die once on normal so take that into consideration if your a casual player
the weapons are fun to use and its your choice what you use though do keep in mind one of the missions forces you to use a weapon (though it is fun so dont worry)

After the campaign its all about horde mode that give its playability.. 

I only play co op, I found the campaign lacking something, the graphics and sound effects are fantastic.. but it seems to lack atmosphere and I'm not sure what it is that could be changed. If you compare to arizona sunshine, which has worse graphics but lots more atmosphere.

The horde mode is really good and enjoyable, although its so frantic you best have a fantastic team mate..

Im not sure what everybody is talking about with glitchy weapons. But I do feel the control with the melee weapons could of been better, you find yourself to randomly throwing your arms around with the axe mowing down enemies.. there needs to be a way of simulating some sort of resistance to stop you wanting to do this. 

I've seen the forums and some good ideas floating about, so I hope the dev's take note and continue working on this so it can be not just good but amazing! Loads more potential, but worth the money in my eyes!","Aug 27, 2018 at 2:53 AM",4, 6,

Every boss spawn starts you with the set of weapons that you need to combat the boss, along with items in the area such as ammo and health. If however you would like to combat the boss with additional items/weapons/preparation, every level has a mid-point save that will start you approximately halfway through the level, so you don't have to play the whole level again. Also, once you reach a boss you unlock a boss-point save, so you can also start the level directly at the boss. When you go to play the campaign, just cycle through the levels and you will see the unlocked start points which you can select and launch. I hope this helps, and you are able to experience the awesome content in the rest of the game!"

Multiplayer doesn't have a store between waves, and for that matter, there are no waves, just an endless onslaught of the same monsters from start to finish.

2022-05-28 14:33:12.014161,AscendentDoot,Short and sweet,"It's a solid VR game with 4 levels, split into 3 sections each. It's a fun experience the first time around, although it falls short when it comes to replayability. The enemy variety is small, with most who run straight at you with no differences between the other enemies. It can still lead to frantic situations. The weapons are the basics (Pistol, shotgun, rifles, and a few melee weapons). I do like the immersion factor of needing to pump the shotty, rechamber the sniper, and such things as that. The ""Puzzles"" of this game are very simple, almost insultingly so. The teleport stamina gimmick is awful when facing bosses (Who once again only run at your face), so I recommend using the locomotive setting. The ending of the game is alright, but when I chose the ""good"" ending, I was wishing that the action would continue, instead of throwing me into a random credits area. There really isn't any incentive for you to replay the missions, unless if you're like me and haven't played co-op with friends yet. If you want an action shooter game like this, wait for a sale, or go play Robo Recall.","Apr 22, 2018 at 5:38 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 14:33:12.031115,hyperman213,Solid Arcade Shooter,"The story mode isn't that great, but the ""Holdout"" mode is great! I play this mode pretty much every day, I'm hoping I can find someone on here to play with! Feel free to add me on Oculus if you'd like a buddy!

The story is a little bland, I don't want to spoil it, but don't expect a deep story. The combat is great, pistols go on your sides, larger weapons go on your back. You can only hold 2 weapons on your back at one time, and there are only 6 weapons in total, that includes your pistol and knives. 

In Holdout mode, you try to survive through wave after wave of monsters. You start with a single pistol and 2 knives, which you can throw. I LOVE the throwing knife ability in this game, it's spot on and it's a ton of fun to do it. I just wish you didn't have to switch to ""throwing knife mode"" when you want it to kill a monster, you can't just throw the knife as it is, you have to press the A button to spin it around. There are a few power ups that help with the battle, even if you don't pick them up they stay available to pickup until the game ends so you can save them and not pick them up. One thing I do hate are the (I don't remember their real names) fireball shooters, they appear in every level of holdout mode and they are EXTREMELY annoying to stop fighting the endless horde of monsters JUST to try and hit a monsters miles away. Plus it doesn't help when they glitch and shoot multiple fireballs at once so you die very easily. I also don't like it when there's boss after boss after boss that spawns sometimes, and sometimes I play an entire round without any bosses or fireball guys.

The multiplayer is almost completely empty, I play pretty much every day for over a month now and I've only seen one person, and it was awesome when we were working together. I also can't get my score to save on here either.

You can avoid this during the whole game, keeping your distance, going slowly or making up your own tactics. But last boss DEMANDS some frantic close combat situations repetitively, and it quickly becomes frustratingly clumsy to the point I just gave up on struggling through it and watched the ending on youtube. Yeah I think this does deserve a 1-star rating, as it is very disappointing to battle your way through a whole game and be let down by glitchy controls at the very ending to the point you start to despise the whole game that was nice once.","Jan 1, 2018 at 9:29 PM",1, 7,

2022-05-28 14:33:24.664486,DJProps,It's pretty good,"Being a seasons KF2 Veteran, I initially went into this game dissapointed as barely anything is the same. It was also one of my first VR games I bought which made the exerience a bit worse as it is a bit more difficult than other VR games. I did not like it.

However, after a couple of months I saw they released a holdout mode, and being more experienced in VR, I began to love the game more every time I played. Holdout was a gateway for me giving the campaign and the game itself another try, and I'm glad I did. 

The gunplay and atmosphere is great throughout the entire game, and it is always great when a game allows different locomotion controls, and while they are not perfect, they get the job done. A few of the levels are buggy and the endings are all cliffhangers, especially the Foster ending. The last level leads you to belive that you are going to fight the Patriarch, a staple of the game who created the zeds from his DNA, but you dont.

Overall its smooth in most parts and a bit lackluster in others, but I enjoyed the experience and i reccomend this came for Killing Floor and VR fans alike. However, I would like a mode more like KF2.

TL;DR: Good gunplay and good story. A few bugs, cliffhanger ending, locomotion not always great.","Dec 14, 2017 at 11:28 AM",4, 10,

A great experience.I have finally tested horde mode and my experience? Trash. I hated horde mode. Pretty much throws you into a stage where you keep getting upgraded guns but spams you with every enemy and boss there is in the game. Doesnt feel like there are any ""waves"" of enemies, they all come at once. I wouldnt mind horde mode being a small ""endless mode"" experience. But instead of that you have to beat every horde mode stage 1 by 1 if you wish to unlock the rest. Very dissapointed. I bought this game in a pack which is the reason why I havent really refunded it yet. It is probably like a 20$ game the way I see it. Still gave it 3 stars because even though it was too short for a 40$ game and had a repetitive story-line the gameplay still felt pretty decent. The only reason to come back to this game is for the horde mode but since its not good at all the game becomes another zombie-shooter that costs too much.

2022-05-28 14:33:27.815647,Javelin396,"Solid Gameplay, but really short lived","As someone who has never played the killing floor games, i didnt have any expectations regarding the franchise. This game, to me is like a better version of arizona sunshine. the game has a good sense of atmosphere and all the  various enemies look great (especially when your hacking/blowing off limbs) The guns/melee weapons feel good to shoot/handle as you would expect them to in VR. That said, theres only a handful of them (knife, axe, sniper rifle, assault rifle, shotgun, pistols, grenades, sword zed arm).  having the pistol holsters by your chest may sometimes result in grabbing the flashlight instead of the pistols, and if you select the waist holster option, it seems as tho they are harder to grab if your not looking straight down at them. teleporting doesnt seem to work consistently, which means i tried to use it sparingly while in free move mode. fine for me since im not a fan of teleporting anyway, but if thats the only way you feel you can play the game, your likely to frustrated with this one. the teleport works well when it does actually decide to work. i've experianced some  rare issues that got me stuck in the floor or have teleported me to an area where i should've have been able to access yet in the course of the mission, forcing me to restart the level. but ultimately my biggest gripe is the games length for the price. only 4 missions for $40 bucks with matchmaking co-op  that doesnt appear to be working as intended is a hard sell. I would hope the devs would add onto the game but i feel like that should come as an expectation to help justify the existing price and not a decision based on whether they can get community support. In short, i like the gameplay thats there, but i feel like there are games that cost less and deliver more out there. this is a good effort on tripwires part, but there needs to be some followthrough on it to fix bugs, and create more content to justify the price (or wait for a sale).","Nov 23, 2017 at 1:21 PM",4, 5,

Most people said this was nothing like it however, the Holdout mode is said to be similar but not exactly the same. Well, seeing I have now played it myself, I really, really enjoyed it. This game isn't perfect it's honestly close. As a VR experience this game is amazing. The controls are good I myself prefer the smooth movement mode which is a lot of fun. For someone new to VR this game is pretty intense with a decent amount of scare to it. I would not suggest if you are not accustomed to VR, however, if you are still set on it, playing in sitting mode is advised. The overall gameplay is very, very fun!","Dec 6, 2017 at 10:31 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 14:33:27.885461,Frosty_Nipps,,"Killing Floor Incursion is a solid game however lacks enough content to worth its price. There are only 4 levels and 7 weapons. The pacing in this game is far too slow for a killing floor game, this is mainly due to the lack of locomotion support. There is locomotion however it is sluggish, buggy, and there are important parts of the levels that are completly inaccessable without the teleport. The game also lacks a few of the zeds. The siren and bloat are missing entirely while the larger zeds are limited to boss fights. You will be fighting clots about 95% of the time. If this game were to receive more weapons, more levels(perhaps just a wave survival mode), and full locomotion support it could be a stellar title.
Edit: With the new holdout mode this game has a whole new level of replayability however the locomotion has not been improved you will still clip through random objects and get stuck all the time. The announcer in holdout is extremely annoying and if you try to rid him by turning down the voice fx volume the zeds will be quieter as well, which makes it near impossible to keep them from sneaking up on you.  Despite that I still find this game to be very fun and i hope they will continue to update it with more technical impovements and content drops.","Nov 15, 2017 at 4:03 PM",3, 10,

Unfortunately each successive level gets worse and worse, culminating in a final boss so horrible 1 star is being too generous.

All the great features that made killing floor great, the trader, large library of weapons, classes you can level up and waves with bosses are all missing.

There are only 2 modes, a 6ish hour campaign (counting time spent trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do) that has an annoying flashlight mechanic and frustrating objectives and holdout, a time based horde mode. Holdout is the primary mode, and is completely time and score based. Killing doesn't feel rewarding (except for an announcer yelling for headshots) and just feels like you're doing it to keep playing. Progression in it consists of random powerups, the odd miniboss from the campaign and a new gun every few minutes in the same area.

I wish they just ported kf2 or something. The machanics and gameplay are great but what they're used for is just trash. Either wait for a propper survival mode or pass.","Nov 21, 2017 at 8:44 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 14:33:37.361050,Ryendeckard,Not killing floor,"Updated for holdout at the bottom: 

There's no weapon purchasing, no finding a merchant between rounds, no open ended levels, no welding mechanics.

You run down a corridor and shoot at killing floor enemies. You don't level up your class, and unlock perks, you don't pick a character and customize them.

When the game ended I thought I just finished the single player campaign/tutorial, then sat at the main menu jaw down when I realized it didn't unlock the /actual/ game.

Avoid this, it's not worth 40$, it's fun while it lasts but it doesn't last long AT ALL, nor is it a killing floor game.

: Holdout Update : This is a step in the right direction but still fails to address many of my original criticisms. I would have been far happier with kf2 ported to vr like payday 2 is doing than what we ended up getting.

Holdout pops a single weapon every few waves in a designated position. That's the upgrade tree. There's no shop keeper, no in between rounds set up, not even something signifying what wave you're on. The holdout levels are very small, but the base killing floor gameplay loop still isn't there. This is still not a killing floor game.","Nov 20, 2017 at 11:19 AM",2, 1,

There is no way to change Difficulty. Lacking on a lot of missions as the gameplay is short. No zombie waves to fight like the provious killing floor game. Basicly the game needs more missions and more modes to play. Not enough to enjoy as multiplayer is just only for the co-op campaign.

It is already the third game that comes out in Oculus without being an international game and only with the English like language, nor even subtitulos in other languages.

Responding to the Developer: It is perfectly clear that on the web the game is only availabe in English, but as a Spanish-speaking user, I emphasize the need for developers to take care of our language and add it to the game as an option. If you divide the community more, making games only in English many users of countries where such language is not native will not buy the game, and you will not sell a copy.","Aug 18, 2017 at 4:52 AM",1, 43,"We are sorry you are disappointed the game doesn't have Spanish language, the the store page is clearly marked that the game is in English only.

At this time we would recommend you request a refund from Oculus until such a time as Spanish localization is added."

It was a little short but I know VR development is complicated, especially FPS VR.  People don't like the teleport system but I guess they haven't looked at the option menu because you can turn on direct movement and only use the jump moving when necessary to get through obsticals and puzzles.  Yes, the rotation is clipped at angles but it's nothing big and it makes rotation comfortable and not queezy.  I will say that this game is not hard at all.  Some parts are a little challenging but all it all it's a simple trip.  The environments are detailed and fun and the voice acting is decent.  I enjoyed the gun placements on the character body so you can draw and holster your wepons easily which was fun.  I feel the game probably had more levels but probably got reduced due to development costs which is why it feels a little short for a AAA game.  I also wish there were more variety of weapons but there's really only five.  Would I buy it again?  Yea, probably, it was fun enough to justify the price for me.","Sep 29, 2017 at 6:20 AM",4, 3,

 could be improved. The teleport for one, if that recharge could be taken off of it, that would make the game more fun, Cause im stuck, getting hammered by a Gorefist, and trying to teleport while he's charging and i can only go a few feet after the intial jump to the other side of the room. The holsters could be spaced better, when i have the holsters placed on my chest i kept grabbing the flashlight instead of the gun, and when they're placed on my hips it's his hips, not mine. Unlike in Robo Recall, the guns are placed at my hips not the character's. Other than that the game is pretty great, its just when a main mechanic of the game is a teleport movement system, placing a cooldown on it makes it inconvenient and iritating to use in a fight.

Monsters will appear and disappear randomly.  Invisible monsters will hit you and you won't be able to hit them back.  Those are only some of the issues I encountered.

The game looks good and has the potential to be a lot of fun.  But right now it feels like it's in beta.  I hope the developers keep working on it.  The movement is especially in need of improvement.  Every VR developer should play Robo Recall as an example of how to implement teleportation movement.

You also can't have multiple save game slots.  So don't expect to easily share this experience with anyone else.

For now, I don't recommend buying this unless it's on sale.  Wait to see if these problems get patched.  With some further develepment, this could be a must have VR title.","Sep 15, 2017 at 6:41 AM",3, 3,

Get all 3 endings
Try experimental free walk (but remember to teleport with right hand if you get stuck)
Watch out for the zombies !

Ignore the bad comments from those who give it just one star. Yes there are some glitches (when using free walk) but its not worth throwing a fit over it.

Which would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that teleport is required for some stages. There is a free movement mode but you will get stuck quite a bit and you can't progress through some areas using it.

The game looks gorgeous, the sound is immersive, but the controls... eh... well... If you buy this game hoping for decent locomotion at the moment... you're gonna have a bad time.

1. The teleportation system is awful at the moment. It's very unintuitive and sticky, for lack of a better word. There were many times I thought my touch controls were dead, or that I was missing some special button press to finalize the teleport. It's that bad.

2. If you don't get motion sick, you will be forced to snap turn as your ONLY OPTION. Some folks don't mind, but there's little denying it breaks the immersion for those of us who can handle smooth rotation, and currently there is no option for it. Sure, room scale VR shouldn't need it, but perhaps the player doesn't want to twist his headset cables into a pretzel after spinning around in a game for an hour or so.

3. If you try the experimental free movement, your ONLY OPTION at the moment is WALKING. Nuff said...

Think all that over a second, kay? Do you want to be walking away from hordes of zombies led by a chainsaw-wielding behemoth, slowly snap-turning your way into a tree? Or would you rather escape the horde via janky teleportation that may or may not activate properly before said behemoth buries his chainsaw into your face as your headset cables bundle up at your feet, or above your head in a tight knot?

The number of guns available throughout the game is very limited, with the sniper is available only in Paris. AR is your best bet for all scenarios, and meds and ammo supply are everywhere. The only good thing about guns is that if you can find 2 ARs, you can grab two of them and go rambo. 

The story-line is quite half-life like, and extremely short. You pretty much ""blink"" to a spot, clear zeds, clear some simple objectives, and move on. The bosses are nothing like those in KF or KF2, as you can pretty much hack your way through a scrake or FP with an axe or blade. 

Unlike Killing Floor 2 or Killing Floor, there is not much replayability in KFI, and if you are expecting anything more than a couple of hours of fun (I cleared my first run in 3 hours), look elsewhere.","Aug 24, 2017 at 1:54 AM",2, 9,We are working towards one as we continue to work on the game.

The controls are horrid for a VR game of this price and there is very little variety with the gameplay. Melee weapons are superior to ranged simply because they're more useful to use and actually work properly.

Enemies spawn behind you way too close.  It doesn't make it hard or fun it's just annoying. I'd rather they spawn from all directions at a decent distance.  Boss battles are boring. Puzzles are basic and easy.  Basically my least favourite game so far.  Enjoyed Lone Echo, Echo Arena, Superhot VR, Robo Recall and even the Ping Pong game from Steam more. Way too much money for what's here.  Way better experiences available for way less money.

Update: I'm starting to think the first wave of reviews are from Developer and fake accounts made to make the scores higher than they should be.

Technically sound game utilising Unreal Engine 4. 2 player co-op is a blast. Oh... and it's gory and you can chop zeds up with decapitated Gorefast arms. Superb!

1) I wish the game was a bit longer. I don't really remember Killing Floor having a story mode - so this seems like a first for the game . It was fun and I loved it, but it was really short for the money.

2) Money wise - if the game goes on sell for 25-30$ then it'll be worth the money as it stands now.

Graphics are nice. Atmosphere is crazily immersive. And of course, just like all the Tripwire's games have the powerful feeling of shooting (sound, visual effect, recoil), KF Incursion has that too!
Recommended.

**Edit**
Well, After playing the Catacomb(2nd) and Paris (3rd) Level, I found some problem in free movement system. The blue teleport line is stuck on my right hand and it's not disappearing unless I drop the weapon and do the painful teleport.
Yep, second problem, the teleport system is not working as expected because of the way Touch Controllers are made. Touch Controllers' Thumbsticks are analog sticks so they wear down, thus they don't always perfectly come back to the center axis... And the teleport system on KF:Incursion wants the thumbstick back to its perfect center axis! That's why you lovely Tripwire devs should tweak the teleport system to be more generous about the center axis.
Also, I can't finish the Paris level. I did all the four puzzles on the rooftop, but after that, nothing happened and I didn't know what to do. lol maybe I should try it again but I found out that there's no checkpoint system, which means I have to do it from the beginning.

Negative points :
- Buggy movements! (Sometimes you have to insist 3 or 4X to go to the place you want! When you have a boss in the butt it's very annoying!
- No interactions with the environment! : An object you like? Impossible to take it, a door closed? Well it will remain ...
- Coop mode does not work with me ... (another bug?)
- The enemies that appear ""like that"": it is NUL! And when they are killed they foolishly disappear! Me I like when they are already in the map and we walk on the corpses after having dislocated !!!
- Interactions with enemies is NULL !! : When you put an ax in the arm, it uncorks the head !?
- The ""enigmas"" are stu! : To open a passage it is necessary to simply shoot parasites, or to pick up 2 cranes on the ground, at no moment one thinks ... it is necessary to know: either one makes a game bourrin or one puts ""
- English! : At least subtitles is not complicated !!! .

Good points :
- The atmosphere

- Aucunes interactions avec l’environnement ! : Un objet vous plais ? impossible de le prendre, une porte fermée ? hé bien elle le resteras...
- Le mode coop ne marche pas chez moi... (encore un bug ?)

It gets very hard late game, but over all, it is quite enjoyable, even solo...Provided you're okay with the boss fights.  Rather thankful you don't fight the big bosses you see in Killing Floor or Killing Floor 2.

Plus, I will say now, the game has a very interesting story!  Trip Wire stated they had hidden clues in their maps that tell the story of Killing Floor itself, but not a lot was truly 'seen', if you know what I mean.  This sheds light on the whole basis of the games and helps answer questions I had since I first hopped into the series! Hat's off to Trip Wire for that!  I really would love to see more of the lore of this game, for sure!

I will say now, however, the game is far from perfect.  Again, the short amount of play time in this is quite a pitty.  I personally think Trip Wire should have kept their plans of a full-on survival mode in this similar to what they already offer in the actual Steam games than anything else.  If they had that, it'd have a lot more replay value.  Nevertheless, the satisfaction you get by beating someone to death with their own limb is a satisfaction no other game has provided yet, and for that, I will beat a million more zeds in the head with their own arms all the more!","Aug 17, 2017 at 4:37 PM",4, 6,

The Game itself ha a decent story, short but interactive scenarios, and some really good weapons, even a bolt action sniper rifle that is awesome to use in VR. my issues however is that the harder zombies are too hard to kill. they are faster more scary and do more damage so they don`t need to take 5 headshots with a pistol to die. in fact they should die with one headshot. and i rather see that you lower my health instead becouse i dont Mind the challenge, but if 6 zombies are surrounding and hitting me while i reload i feel like i allready lost, but i manage to kill them all without dying. and it feels like im cheating.
And yeah when i try to grab my pistols i end up with nothing, like they are in the wrong position. and this was not a problem in Robo recall or any other game. so if you are reading this devs. move the grenade to the chest beside the flashlight and make the area where you grab your pistols larger while on the waist. all the issues aside this is one of my most favorite experiences in VR, it has the best guns made in VR and they are so satisfying to use. and vizuals in this game is good they belong in a art museum.","Aug 22, 2017 at 2:48 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 14:34:44.071294,Nikael123,Loved it! But....,"First of all, i have to be honest, i've been playing killing floor games..... since like... 2009... wich might affect my opinion of it alittle bit, the game itself is good, even great, while some complain that killing floor didn't need an story mode... i completely disagree, it was really nice to be actualy having an narrative in your playing, and it was funny, i mean... come on! when you first get to know who's behind the errors... Gotta love it, right? Anyywaay! the game play was nice, i pissed myself both when the scrake first rushed up in my face to bum rape me, aswell as whit the fleshpound. controlls when you pull the shotgun was a bit wonky, so i simply pressed reload betwen shots instead, wich i found more easier (don't really like shotguns in the first place so i mostly used it as a club again the cloths). The sniper aswell, i didn't use both my hands on that, i simply laid my left arm in support under right hand and got a much easier aim whit it, by the way i loved the encounter whit the sniper, maybe because i'm a sniper freak in games i guess? sharpshooter since 2009!...... Anyways... I do think the placement of the left gun vs flashlight could have been better, as i found myself in many an trapped moments where in the heat of the moment i was just turning the flashlight on and off... The last boss was a bit of an disappointment, and i got stuck for a while due to not seeing eye scanner from an distance. Now... I must admit i feelt a bit duped when i realized we don't have an classic killing floor mode, because that's something i've wished for since vr began shaping into what it is, now i don't see why people say it's garbage just due to that, tho i admit they should atleast have added collectibles and diffrent diffeculities for the story mode if they have no plans for a survival mode ( wich i shall wish for, as then i will not need another game ) Anyways, i feel like i had more to say...

Why does everything have to be so dark? I know the other Killing Floor games does this too, but when your flashlight follows your torso instead of your aim this is annoying!
Like other have said, having enemies spawn INSIDE you should really not be happening. You have to be able to chose spawn locations based on where the player is somehow. 

This is probably just me whining, but I had really hoped for more from this game.

Haptic feedback could be better. When melee weapons interact with enemies and the environment. The shotgun also has weak haptic, visual, and auditory feedback making it hard to know when it's pumped.

The positioning of equipment is also annoying. I think Arizona Sunshine had it right. The grenades get in the way and the guns are hard to reach for without looking in either position.

I already own a Vive but Killing Floor: Incursion is what made me want to own a Rift.  The game does not disappoint!! It's like The Brookhaven Experiment on sterioids.  It's what that game should have been.  KFI is scary as f##K! And that first boss, wow!  For anyone who has ever played Dead by Daylight and heard the rev of the Hillbilly's chainsaw, this encounter has that beat.

I would like to see a smooth turning option in addition to the snap rotation and an option to click the analog stick to run faster.  If there's a concern about motion sickness, maybe add an optional blur effect around the edges of the screen while moving fast like some games offer.

The only thing I didn't like about the controls is that B and Y are reload.  It would be more comfortable if it were A and X.  It just feels awkward to reach your thumbs over to B and Y especially when dual wielding guns. You also have to stop to reload w/free move.

The other issue I encountered was in the catacombs.  Experimental free movement will not work in certain areas of the level.  I had to switch back to teleport.  That needs to be fixed.

I would like to see an option incorporated where you can pickup ammo and health packs without having to have a free hand.  I was free roaming and dual wielding while fighting the bosses.  It was challenging to holster my weapon while trying to move so I could free up a hand to grab ammo and health.  Maybe you can run over it to pick it up or just point at it when holding a weapon and it will auto grab it.

What are the 2 bottom holster ""pockets"" used for?  They look like grenades might fit in there but I couldn't put them in there.

I see that there are 12 levels spread across 4 different locations.  I have a feeling I'll blow through them all pretty quickly.  Will there be additional maps, modes or difficulties added.  Based on the first 3 levels played I can say I would gladly buy DLC for this game.

It's pretty short and doesn't offer much replay value.

So see ya later CoOp guy! Sorry I didn't get your name... I did not see if there were difficulty levels or not.. But seeing how a lot of the game is simplistic puzzles and listening to exposition I'm not itching to play through it again at any difficulty level. 

It also doesn't really hold up to the fluid shooting or weapon interaction Roborecall. I would of thought the gun nuts at Tripwire would have allowed us to rack the slide etc and reload realistically(Would be nice to see at higher difficulty levels)...
