Followed by a stage of catching fifteen fish in a time limit. You complete that to end up in a sub room that is under the sea. The fish models swimming by are super cute, but that's it. You can replay the intro, chill in the sub room or replay shooting at fish with rainbows to catch them. 
Any attempts to go to stage two just took me right back to the sub room, So it's pretty but if the full game is there I couldn't get to it.","Dec 1, 2019 at 1:30 AM",2, 12,
