2022-05-28 20:10:17.211266,Ebcdic_Fortran,Doesn’t work over Bunch. Can’t join VR,"This game only appears to work if you play with a friend in VR.     

FEATURES THAT DON’T WORK!

1.  The options to join a VR game from your phone does not work. Password always says incorrect passwords

2. The option to play over bunch does not work. When attempting to play with a friend you get placed in a waiting room, then it says the room closed. There’s no button to start the game!

Shame that so many playing options do not work!","Jul 6, 2020 at 5:06 PM",3, 11,"Sorry that you have encountered these issues!
If you want to play a multiplayer game with mobile players please make sure you select the 'Face to Face' Game Mode option when you Host a Game. Mobile players cannot join the normal Online Multiplayer matches (which may explain the incorrect password error you have been encountering)
If you continue to face issues please contact crew@spaceteamvr.com and we will help you the best we can"

There are so many random aspects thrown in that make each game addicting and incredibly enjoyable.   Communication is key and a blast!,"May 30, 2020 at 1:03 PM",5, 9,Thanks Adam!
