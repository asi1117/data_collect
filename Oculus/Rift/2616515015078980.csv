No so much Myst (this is not an exploration game as such) but the Arxel Tribe and Kheops titles, such as Cleopatra and Egypt games. 
Complete with some stunted voice overs or clunky controls. Sound puzzzles, mirror puzzles, broken jigsaw pieces that have to be found, dials and cogs to be turned, it is all too familiar. For me, being thrown back in time a bit, that's certainly a very good thing, it is this genre that hooked me to gaming in the first place. I love that VR proves to be aan great medium for Adventure Games! 
So if you love wandering around (lovingly made) pseudo-historical surrounding such as temples and harbours, love being stuck some times at a puzzle, well, this is most definitely a game for you. So don't expect jaw dropping Asgarth graphics, but what there is, will most certainly transport you to an ancient world. 
Recommended, worth the price. And just worth it to appreciate and encourage studio's to keep making AG's.","May 24, 2021 at 12:03 AM",4, 22,
2022-05-28 20:45:02.268608,pathmakerjen,Unsatisfying and Clunky,"Escape Room puzzles are of the ""find the object and then solve a simple visual"" variety.  It takes patience more than cleverness.  The graphics are not as good as the advertising, and the whole feel is clumsy.  Make sure you can fetch your backpack from your head, as you'll need it to get anywhere.  Puzzle hints are basically absent; expect to spend a lot of time mindlessly wandering around, or consulting a walk-through.  Later puzzles rely even more on found objects, which makes them frustrating to get past if you can't find the thing.  Pretty boring gameplay even in the few clever parts.  Cinematics are long and slow.","Jun 13, 2021 at 8:10 AM",2, 3,
