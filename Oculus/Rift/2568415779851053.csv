2022-05-28 18:43:20.677757,sambodiaaa,Patch pls! :'( (amazing while it lasted),"This game literally saved my life last year when I went through a breakup with a fiancee and lost everything, my house, my job, my pet. 
I love VR and finally I found a way I could meditate.

Sadly though, the app has deteriorated to the point that it is painful to use now. Loading errors in connecting to server or something cause the various Tripps to crash and I literally want to cry. This app is so important to me, and without a solid source of income I simply can't afford a quest.

I'd forgive, but they are releasing update after update fror Quest users, new worlds, new meditations, a new phone app similar to other meditation apps. 

I genuinely have something like 400 clocked hours in this game. 

And now I feel just as discarded as I was in that traumatic breakup last year.",May 1 at 7:45 PM,2, 4,
2022-05-28 18:43:20.692717,Zucke305,Please Keep PC Support! Fantastic App!,"Let me start by saying that in my opinion this is a 5 star app. The review reflects what I believe and can see that the PC version is on the backburner compared to the mobile version. I appreciate being able to do VR meditation ""anywhere"" but realistically I do it at my desk that has a capable computer with a VR set up.  I've been into meditation for more than 5 years now, and I've had most of the phone apps (Calm being my go to). There is something TRULY SPECIAL about what you guys have done here!

The experience of meditation in VR is truly different and unique.

However, I can tell that the developer has kind of stopped working on the PC version of Tripp and that is deeply sad. Right now there isn't even controller support for the mood survey. Please I love the program, I love the concept, I just really don't want you guys to totally jump ship to Mobile/Quest experiences. 

The graphical difference is just enormous. 

I have a Quest 2 so yes I do access the mobile version of the app often however, the FOVeated rendering in the mobile version is horrific to me (I'm obviously not a typical ""lifestyle"" user, I'm a huge nerd).",Feb 4 at 9:24 PM,4, 9,
2022-05-28 18:43:20.707677,Bob-Rolha,Only in English? No language options?,"Can I only meditate if I know English? Narrative programs of this type should make an effort to add other languages. Just hire a voice actor on a weekend. I live in Brazil.
I like abstract art, but in this case, the graphics and effects of the demo version didn't look very interesting. I believe it get better as the game progresses.
But I can change the rating in the future, if there are improvements and option for the Portuguese language, from Brazil or Portugal, at least.",Mar 2 at 12:02 AM,2, 0,
2022-05-28 18:43:20.721640,spenc.meier,defective,I bought this for my oculus rift S and parts are defective. Portions which link in to a video will stall and then give me a message that my WiFi connection is too slow or non existant. This is clearly not the case. I have super fast WiFi connections. The game is defective. The parts that do work (breathing exercises) are nice.,Feb 23 at 1:30 PM,2, 0,
2022-05-28 18:43:20.736600,gadget124,Breathing exercises,Could you add a section where we can practice different types of breathing. Would be really great for beginners like me.

2022-05-28 18:43:23.860246,bluefeather11,Bravo!,"In a time when opportunities to focus on negativity surround us, the talented individuals at TRIPP focused on creating an experience full of wonder and beauty.  Thank you for your positive contributions to peace and well-being.  I have every meditation program available for VR and this one is my favorite.",Dec 22 at 10:12 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:43:23.875205,TheOutlier8675309,A Skeptic Convinced,"I have had extreme sleep disturbances for years.  One session with Tripp and I slept like a baby for 6 straight hours, which is a miracle for me.  I don't know much about the theory here, but it sure did seem to work.  In addition, it is super fun.  It is like going to a lasarium show that soothes your mind.  And.. all you have to do is sit there.  Great app!",Oct 6 at 7:27 PM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:43:23.890165,mcmahonfx,Fantastic,"This app is beautifully artistic, calming and centering. I enjoy it and highly recommend it.",Aug 20 at 12:22 AM,4, 4,
2022-05-28 18:43:23.904128,douglas170256,This sotware is getting worse!,Most of the 'Escape' section videos freeze after a few seconds. Also it would be good to allow some or all of the sofware to load on to the device for when you are in a bad connection area! This is NOT a calming experience when you have to wait for loading which very often fails!!!!,Jan 13 at 7:53 AM,2, 9,
2022-05-28 18:43:23.919088,TimelordQ,Be Mindful,"Having issues in the past in 'visualizing' with guided meditation, Tripp is something I love because not only does the VR 'assist' with the visualizations, it's also habit building and reinforcing - which to me is perfect for my needs. 

While there's a good deal of variety with the landscapes and emotional reinforcement in the app, it could certainly use more of this handiwork, but what's offered now to me has been well worth the ""lifetime investment"" cost, for this well put together and presented app that delivers on it's promise. 

To be clear though. I've had problems forming habits with meditation and (especially) visualization in the past in doing things that worked for others, which is why this app works perfect for me. It creates the visuals and makes it easy for someone like me to have formed the habit of daily usage with it.","May 9, 2021 at 3:17 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 18:43:27.007827,rogerrobinson,Great for PTSD,"Im doing a regime of breathing exercises twice a day - and altho doubtful at first, this App is backed up by research, cos i looked into it. Very Glad i bought it. Best purchase so far.","Apr 28, 2021 at 4:21 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 18:43:27.022787,Insamity666,"Good on paper, but...","Mostly, it gave me very intense motion sickness and I tradded being stressed out for a headache and a vague urge to vomit. I wish they wouldn't move you around and that they'd stick with the breathing exercices instead of the coin thing. Also, I found the voice pushing you to move on from the breathing phase very annoying. Stop interrupting, I'll look at the light when I want to, and no need to point at it, it's very disruptive from the environment. Not for me.","Mar 29, 2021 at 6:42 AM",1, 5,

2022-05-28 18:43:30.160394,TheMoldQueen,Pretentious hippie crap,"Slow, ineffective, pretentious and boring. Some of the worst things a piece of software can be, but this joke of an app (can you even call it that? it's more like an art student playing with Unity and claiming it's a ""spiritual experience, maaaan"") manages to pull off all of them.


The only thing more irksome than the impressionable, soft skulled halfwits that claimed this thing works for its intended purpose, are the idiots that pay money for the premium version.","Dec 28, 2020 at 11:06 AM",1, 11,
2022-05-28 18:43:30.175355,THOR90X,Dont believe everyone else,Meditation is meant to be simple. This is what this does. It is a tool. Repetition is the point. This concept can go very far. Developers if you see this. Keep up the good work.,"Dec 3, 2020 at 4:19 AM",5, 14,

2022-05-28 18:43:33.352856,Matt19084,Good but needs work,"The actual meditation is good but getting there is painful. Logging in is takes ages, it kicks you out every time and the using the code to pair it with the app doesn't work, so VR typing your email every time is needed. After that it takes around 5+ mins for the daily practice to load. For me I wanted a way to wind down before bed but by the time I'm done I just end up more frustrated. It will be a good app if these painful bits can be fixed","Oct 12, 2020 at 6:02 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 18:43:33.367816,Archemidis,We all know why we really got this game.,"Obviously, the game is intended to guide the user through meditation; guided breathing and what-not. I got this game because I thought it might be an interesting interactive experience with trippy illusions and graphics. My initial experience was chosen by an AI, based on how I was feeling at the moment. Super cool. At one point in the experience, I controlled some geometric sprite (which reminded me of recycled Unity entities) through some weird clusters of balls that didn't pop like I expected them to, only shooting out confetti. Kinda lame. Although the AI is really cool and it seriously calmed me down, I wouldn't ever pay for it.","Sep 1, 2020 at 12:58 AM",3, 18,
2022-05-28 18:43:33.382776,Dephael,subscription based waste of time,"this was a boring game under guise of meditation. from the demo, collecting coins slowly and looking at large 3d abstract objects is not meditation or relaxing.
a kaleidascope and a youtube vid will do the same job. 
we dont need more subscriptions.","Sep 29, 2020 at 7:43 AM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 18:43:33.399730,MMO887,Not for me,"I don't like giving negative reviews and it's not my style. I know making games take a lot of effort, time etc... However, I was surprised at how simple this mediation games is. I will say that this is my first mediation game.

When I signed up; the company had a special for under $20 a year, so I tried the 7 day trial. Without the special, the company is asking for just under a 100 dollars a year. 

The game is full of videos that are filmed in 360 degree . I can get similar videos off YouTube for free, why would I pay almost 100 bucks a year. A lot of the environments are loud or have visuals taht are overwhelming. For example, one location has these bright lights that go flying (very fast) past me and it started to bother my eyes. The other 360 degree video is in a field full of cows with bells, how's are these relaxing? Just to mention a couple, but there are others like these ones.

The company, as I know, has two different mediation environments, uploaded daily. One is for day use; the other for night. But that annoying voice (esp in one video) just interupts and got to me when I was trying to relax. even when I pushed the limiting voice options, the voice didn't let me totally relax; and just interupted me from trying.

I don't know if other mediation games are full of 360 degree videos, but this is not for me, especially at that price. However, that said give it a try and judge for yourself, for a small fee a month. or the 7 day trail.

No, I would not recommend this to a friend.


Reply to your feedback/reply to my review. Yes, here in Canada it shows almost $100 a year, regular price/yr. I clearly was not being sarcastic or condescending in my review.  I stated for people to try it out.","Jul 31, 2020 at 2:06 PM",2, 24,"Thank you so much for your honest reaction to our product. We appreciate you taking the time to let us know how you feel.

I'm only using the trial, but I would love to do that for a LOT longer. 
Very realxing in general, although some of the patterns are a bit distressing at times, one looks like spider webs and I hate spiders lol
Another looks like a razor blades and red is often distressing to the brain.

2022-05-28 18:43:36.530357,Mister.Anderson.2019,orientation problem,"I have tried several similar meditation apps so far. With tripp my problem is that if I lay down in my comfortable chair leaning back the orientation of the display is always in the sitting position so all the menus and all the action is on the bottom and I have to twist my head to reach the menus. I tried to reset the orientation and it works in many other apps. Not so in tripp. If I enter the menu ""reset orientation - now press trigger..."" the default orientation again is sitting position. An option for this would be really helpful.","Aug 29, 2020 at 8:21 PM",2, 1,

2022-05-28 18:43:39.680930,Aemitix,Demo Review,"Reviewing the Demo, so not sure if some of these points are in the full version 

visuals look better than SoundSelf, but like SoundSelf, the name lures the user into thinking it can be a self guided method of meditative trance. There are many in the VR community who returned experiences like this and SoundSelf due to 2 main requests. 

-Allow users to turn off the voiced guidance
-Allow users to use thier own music, and the music can affect the visuals

If this allowed me to take some time to become lost in 180 or 360 visuals with a choice of calming sounds or ability to use my own music, i would buy it","Jul 17, 2020 at 10:19 PM",3, 1,"Hello,
Yes you can turn off the voice in our experience.  We are launching more features in the next few weeks that will allow you to select voice type, etc.  The sounds in our experience have been carefully selected for effect.  However, feel free to play your own music through an alternate device with additional headphones until we are able to allow you to connect your own audio content to the experience.

I recently had a busted stomach ulcer and bleeding due to guess what... stress what else, so I think this will help I can already see a difference. I've already learned a few breathing techniques that I can feel are helping, the general calmness of the whole thing can't be bad once a day. If you feel tense inside, if you stop to think and you can't hear silence, this is for you, don't wait till you experiment the burning and knotting in the pit of your stomach.
I haven't used it much yet but for the price of a stupid game I might not even like, this will be useful for my health as long as I'm willing yo take the time to use it. Some parts are ""to me"" somewhat less useful ( filler ) but what works works, you got to give to Caesar yatta yatta.....
