If it was genuine, then of course I would have heard from them. I strongly recommend that if anyone is to buy any game through this medium; Oculus stores ( Oculus Store is genuine) is to now head to the website of the actual game you want to purchase ask if their game is genuine BEFORE you buy! If you don't hear from them NEVER buy the game from the Store from this platform Oculus.

2022-05-28 13:37:37.497974,DelapierceD,"Gorgeous, Immersive, Needs Direction","Extremely easy to get lost in this. Which is fine if you want to just float through space, but to actually complete the objectives, you need to know where you are going, and the game offers very little guidance in where to go next

I personally find this design choice annoying in that it tries for realism in a misguided way. If you were living on the space station, you would know which way to the power station or whatever you needed

All that said, it is a lovely time to float through and look, once letting go of the urgency to accomplish the tasks","Mar 9, 2021 at 6:15 AM",3, 15,

2022-05-28 13:37:40.656141,SolidRustle,Not worth your time.,"This is an impressive game only in terms of graphics, it is breathtaking and very good looking game for its age.

Other than that, it is a numbingly boring walking (zero g walking) simulator, there is nothing exciting about it, the objectives are repetitive and the gameplay only consists of navigating zero g control which is nausauting due to the poor performance of this game even when im on 1660ti i5 9300H 16gb SSD...you just float and collect O2 tanks and go to panels after panels. 

Personally I have no problem with using xbox controller due to lack of motion control support, still don't like the arogant post by the developer rating his own game 5 stars giving lazy excuse about the game not having motion control support just because it didn't exist when the game launch tho, plenty of other devs have put time into introducing motion control update to their games by pouring their heart into it, this one simply just dont have the passion.

We weren't able to implement Touch Controls for ADR1FT simply because they didn't exist when we made and released the game (Rift launch title). We all moved onto new things shortly after and our publisher wasn't interested in financially supporting the work needed to do the arms/touch controls properly. Sad, but that's life. We'd do it in a second if we could. We talk about it all the time. Maybe someday...

2022-05-28 13:37:46.993964,Metamorpho,Mixed review,"This has excellent graphics, cleanest I have seen yet. I got it when on sale. And it is good for the sale price. I don't know the history of this game. But it seems it was created during the days of xbox controllers, since you cannot use your hands in the VR other than through pure button press. I think some of the performance issues is purely because the author is pushing the limit of the graphics. It's not bad though.  I wouldn't call this a demo you could show to a newbie because they would have a hard time using the pure thrust controls. It's good for 5 bucks but if you already have lone echo your not going to be impressed. two years ago this might of been the cat's meow.

2022-05-28 13:37:47.009921,Refrizor,One of the BEST VR games!,"Heya, ignore the bad reviews. They are just complaining about performance issues (read the specs) and remotes not working.

First off, touch is NOT compatible. But that doesn't matter!

I had an amazing experience playing on a keyboard/mouse with the Oculus Rift! Graphics and quality are downright BEAUTIFUL. The developers did a fabulous job with this game.

The story, graphics, scenery, and quality are like 10/10. I HIGHLY recommend it!
* Xbox One controller and keyboard + mouse are supported. Again, touch is not. Had one of the best VR experiences, ever, with this game! <3

Pssst, to those people who are complaining about motion sickness, I don't think you read the comfort level. Don't buy a game if it says INTENSE and then you complain with a review because your motion sickness was intense. :P

I got this and Robinson in the sale and boy was I glad I did coz they are both diamonds in the rough and show of what VR is about (realism) Now we just need those touch controllers implemented a bit better but dont let that turn you off this game, that was what made me stall from buying this before but I'm glad I got it now and at a great price.","Mar 25, 2018 at 2:37 AM",5, 6,

Why someone made a game for VR where none of the normal VR controls are there eludes me. You can't grab anything like you would in a normal VR game, using the grab button. X is the grab button, it's just automated. And you have to boost yourself around with really unintuitive X, Y, Z controls. I love how Lone Echo lets you grab things and throw yourself from them and the arm boosters are aimable etc. This game is nothing like that. Also, I'm a hardcore Comfort:Intense player, I play all games on smooth turning and non-teleport and never get motion sick. This is THE ONLY game that makes me motion sick!

I love the quality of graphics the feeling of being in space etc. I will have to say that I get motion sickness playing this game. I just take 1000mg of Ginger root before playing to account for this because it is worth it. Also, the game is pretty demanding so if you do not have dedicated controllers for your USB oculus you might experience issues. 

Even after having to get Ginger Root for motion sickness, new USB controller card for the oculus, this game is amazing, and I recommend it.  I always wanted to be an astronaut, and this makes me feel like one!","Dec 19, 2017 at 7:01 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 13:37:56.566714,oandroido,"Loved it, mostly.","Long story short: gets a bit repetetive, but some of the moments floating around seeing the earth below while you drift between parts of the station... really nicely done. Not perfect, would give 3.5 stars, but giving 4 since it's better than a 3. 

Main reason it's not really a solid 4 is due to the repetetive stuff, some lazy modeling (leaves floating in perfect rows), and a somewhat incoherent story (you'll see...).

Also fairly easy/casual, but that's OK.

It's not a game, but a simulator with a more adult rithm and story. It never get old to maneuver in zero-g. It's more realistic than Echo-One and it's a full on simulation down to the smallest details. I never wanted it to end. This thing is constant mental orgasm. Don't expect any action nor congratulation for your actions,  you are alone and on your own. It's a crazy feeling thrusting into the space and realizing you may not have enough air to get to your planned target. But don't worry the game is not punishing with timed air, you get more that you need. I cried at the end because I did not want to return to earth. I will definitely start another game, but now I feel like the world is spinning. For people complaining about motion sickness, VR is not the problem here, this the reality that astronaut have to deal with during space walk.

2022-05-28 13:38:02.914995,WhyKlef,"Sad... *OCULUS, HEARD OF PARAGRAPHS???*","It seems like the people developing this game had one goal, make money and run away with it. This game aims for a very specific goal, put the player in perspective of an astronaut and that it does well. Yes some people will get nauseated and yes it aims for a more extreme experience but get this, that is what this title is about. Not so much a game but instead, an experience, built towards putting people in a situation where every second feels like your last and yet, you carry on the struggle of seeing through a daunting, near impossible task.

So why 2 stars? Let me answer that by a question, why the lack of support devs? You are launching on a new platform, a new era, wouldn't you want to tailor your game as the market constantly defines itself? Where is the Touch support? Heck, where is even controls support? I booted my game, my touch does not respond, neither does my Xbox One controller... I had to play this game with my keyboard and mouse... How sad is that? 

Of course, I probably ran into a bug/glitch of some kind but should the devs be there to support their games, I'd see them respond to some of the reviews, and I could also expect them to eventually respond to mine but nope, that company decided that supporting it's own product was too much to ask for. 

You know, the truth is that maybe the company closed because it didn't make money, or maybe it did and wanted out. Either way, it's bad practices for consumers because I was drawn into purchasing that game after the company was no more, I would expect them to have been paid for that at that point in time so it feels off regardless.

A note to all those complaing about nausea, it's called virtual reality and not virtual arcade for a reason, astronauts train for months and years to deal with the motion sickness that floating in space can create, if you don't want to experience that, play it on a normal monitor, and to the reviewer who comlained about being spun around when bumping into debris, that's what you'd expect to happen. That being said it does feel like a bad port of a 2D game, turning your head should turn your helmet, you shouldn't need to use a joystick to look around.  The game would massively benefit from adding touch control to it and a rework of the navigation system so you had at least some clue of where to go would be good.  One reviewer noted that you don't lose oxygen if you are just floating around, you use it from thrusting which if true (I have no reason to doubt that this is the case) seems a ridiculous idea from the game designers, if your suit is leaking oxygen then the levels will drop constantly anywhere, this is part of the reason that people are struggling as they are trying to do things quickly as they have already been warned that the suit is leaking.

2022-05-28 13:38:12.410950,marciot,Adjust your expectations...,"The game is not as difficult as some reviewers make it out to be. You are not racing against the clock. Except for limited outdoor environments where your suit unexplicably leaks, you *do not* spend oxygen by breathing or looking around, you only spend it for propulsion. So take it slow, plan your moves carefully and then use microbursts of trust to drift slowly towards your targets. The faster you try completing this game, the worse you will do. This is not an action game, this is a game of precision; it is very calming and beautiful once you realize that there isn't a rush -- mastering fine control and inertia becomes a rewarding experience in itself. The few outdoor environments, where time *does* matter, provide an occasional adrenaline rush and time you spent practicing precision indoors will be of tremendous help. My conclusion is that this is a excellent, relaxing game. If it feels like an action-survival game, you are doing it wrong.","Dec 23, 2016 at 1:34 PM",5, 10,

2022-05-28 13:38:15.555170,PathlessNomad,Pretty buy shallow,"This is a very pretty game. The space station has great art design and the graphics are very nice. 

Sadly that's as far as it goes. The levels in the space station are very repetitive. That isn't helped by the fact that you have to visit the same place multiple times. Then you have the nearly non existant navigation aids. It is very difficult to tell where you should be going. Your helmet obscures objective markers on the screen, so if it isn't directly in front of you, you can't see it. And the map just gives you a vague direction.

That whould all be ok if the game was interesting. It's just go from place to place, hold X, and repeat. Every so often you might have to avoid some dangerous areas, but mostly you are playing against the navigation.

And to add insult to injury, this is the only game that's ever made me sick. I mean, take off the headset and go lie down for an hour sick.","Dec 27, 2016 at 2:15 AM",2, 4,

2022-05-28 13:38:18.714839,rabbitovsky,A fascinating but flat experience,"--Reviewer Note: I am still in the middle of the game--

This title is at times awe-inspiring and at others frustrating.  From a VR standpoint the chance to play out your own ""Gravity"" movie is drool worthy.  The lack of real interactivity doesn't by itself take away from this 'experience', instead being overshadowed by an almost non-existant level navigation system that occasionally leaves you utterly confused about where to go next.  This headache makes it much more difficult to push past the nausea that can be induced by this 'could have been great' zero-gravity title.","Dec 7, 2016 at 10:14 AM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 13:38:18.747751,m0bius,Puke-o-rama!,"I have a pretty sturdy stomach for VR, but this one did me in quickly.  There are several reasons why motion sickness is such a big deal here:

1) Because you're in microgravity, there is no up & down.  No frame of reference = bad juju

2) Acceleration and deceleration happen quickly.  Strike two for VR integration.

3) Because you are in space, there is drag to slow you if you end up in a roll or spin.  Strike three.

4) If you didn't already need another reason, there's this bug that tosses you around in virtual space at random.  I think it's a head tracking issue rather than an avatar position issue, but it's definitely a nasty bug.

In addition to the high barf factor, I found it difficult to line up with certain objects in order to use or grab them (like oxygen tanks).  

I'd like to go further in the game, but there are too many negative factors to want to continue playing any longer.  Sorry, this looked like a promising game!","Dec 5, 2016 at 1:04 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 13:38:18.762710,conn0,Mostly Beautiful VR Experience,"The environment and the overall aesthetic of the game is amazing. This is however the first and only game I've felt sick playing, this is not due to the game being in virtual reality but due to the controller constantly vibrating. There is no way (as i know of) to disable this feature. I have tried playing with gloves but it doesn't do much to stop the numbing in my hands.  Played around 30 minutes, what I did play was fantastic. I just wish it was possible to disable the vibration feature, until then I patiently wait before I play this game again.","Dec 16, 2016 at 5:41 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 13:38:21.877538,yellownumber5,,"Hard to play for too long. They get some things right, but then follow it with some nauseating nono's. The helmet works well, but i have to lean forward, reset my view, then return to my seated position to see the full HUD inside the helmet. Camera control is frequently taken away, once in a while with an animation, but abusively common by constantly bumping into floating debris, which is everywhere, making you spin around. An ocassional bump is ok, but the turning! Also if your feet (which you can rarely see where they are) drag against something you are spun forward.  This happens almost every doorway I go through. Not good in VR, and makes it a dizzying nauseating chore to get around.  They were so close to making something special here.","Nov 23, 2016 at 4:27 PM",3, 3,

Bit of a pity it does not have Touch support, I think inside the station most obvious way to propel yourself would be to push away from various handles, not fiddle with EVA suit thrusters.
Also, the camera skips in an unpleasant way if you physically turn around too much. I understand not wanting to show you the backside of your helmet, but still, it's just not nice.","Dec 5, 2016 at 3:12 AM",4, 1,

There's very little gameplay too, by the look of what I saw during the brief period I was able to play before reaching for the barf bag: float between doors and oxygen, and pixel hunt and backtrack through levels until you find whatever you missed that unlocks the next section.  I wanted to like this game, but 
even if you have steady VR legs, it'd still be tough to recommend.","Nov 27, 2016 at 6:33 PM",3, 2,
