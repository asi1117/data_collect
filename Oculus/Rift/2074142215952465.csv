Not sure why you insisted on designing for large room's, something like this should basically be a standing/picking/throwing type experience.  You don't want kids bumping into walls.  Also, the skip button is sometimes SO FAR AWAY that we can't even press it without ""resetting view"" several times to get close enough.  You should consider adding an ""easy mode"" for younger kids, where things are practically done for you, and have a button on the controller that skips so that parents can proceed if their kids are getting bored of the scene.","Jun 16, 2020 at 6:53 AM",2, 1,

2022-05-28 19:17:26.360289,CyberMax007,"Potential, but just meh.","I know a 3 year old is most liekely too young to play this, but daughter tried this game with me and even if we set the height settings in Oculus to 3 feet, the game doesnt adjust to this height and everything feels so big and it becomes unplayable. We managed to find a sutable height to do most things, but painting the uper part of the dress, or picking up the glass shoe was impossible. Some games are easy like picking up flowers and cooking the soup, but some others are just too hard or take way too long to complete. We ended up quitting the game half way through. I'm not a fan of 2D characters. Why not make 3D characters like the rest of assets in the scenes.","Mar 16, 2020 at 8:13 AM",2, 2,"Thank you so much for your feedback!  The game was not originally intended for age 3; however, your feedback around adjusting the height of certain activities has been noted and an update was just released!  We added made the dress adjust to the height and lowered some of the other objects making it more height appropriate for all.  We also added achievements and ""skip"" buttons next to all activities if they ever seem to hard.  Thanks again for your valuable feedback!"
2022-05-28 19:17:26.375249,MrE.Nigma,Very neat and unique experience,"My 4yo daughter loves VR,  but she's a little too young to play, she loves to sit and watch and ""help"" me play MY games. She also loves Cinderella.  This is the absolute perfect game for me to play while she watches.  Even if she doesnt play, she can watch on my screen and ""help"" me make decisions.  Although the voice work is a little rough, I was pleasantly surpised.  I would love to see more like this.","May 22, 2019 at 5:22 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 19:17:29.484931,SmokeyTheKat,Charming and engaging,It was a pleasant surprise to be an active participant in an ages old story that never gets old. The interaction with the touch controllers made the experience one I can't wait to share with my friends and family as an introduction to the oculus rift. Its simple and creative storytelling beats takes advantage of effectively telling a story in VR. Can't wait for more fairy tales from this creative developer.,"Feb 24, 2019 at 10:48 AM",5, 4,
