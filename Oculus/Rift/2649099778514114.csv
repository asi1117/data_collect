2022-05-28 20:44:15.601425,Crow1123,Fun if you're new to VR,"While this game doesn't even compare to games like Doom VFR, I played it when I first got a Quest 2 via Link and found it fun for a little while. Would probably only recommend this to people new to VR to experience a Doom-like shooter game. That's actually how I felt playing this, like I was playing an upscaled version of an old Doom game. If you're already a seasoned FPS player I'd just recommend going with Doom VFR (they finally updated with free-turning which is awesome) for the best FPS VR intense shooting game experience.",Oct 1 at 9:48 AM,3, 2,"Hey Crow1123, We're very glad that you liked the game.

2022-05-28 20:44:15.616385,DiddlyFack,I'm not quite sure if I'm winning?,Cool character designs but the enemies just kind of run up and stand in front of you as you shoot at them then disappear. I didnt expect much for a dollar and definitely got what I paid for.,"Mar 19, 2021 at 9:32 PM",1, 5,"Hi Diddly, thank you for your comment, When you complete a Level you win +1 more Life, when you die, and you have extra Life you can use it to continue from the same Level.

2022-05-28 20:44:15.630348,WatchDog229,"terrible, dont waste a penny",has a lot of mis spellings (I.E Alfa instead of Alpha and many more). The gameplayt feels bland and repetitive. It is just the same thing over and over again with slightly different guns and the same enemies. DO NOT BUY,"May 22, 2020 at 5:10 AM",1, 14,
2022-05-28 20:44:15.644311,ZazitheBeast,Mindless; its not a bad thing,"Sometimes you just want to check out and play something that kills the time for you. This si pretty good for that. I only gave it 2 stars because of all the VR games i have this is the only one that glitches. However it only glitches when I switch guns. If they fix that, I would give it a better rating.","Mar 23, 2020 at 11:55 PM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 20:44:15.658273,DreamerO,A simple yet addicting shooter,"The monsters you fight sometimes feel like they spawned from the Resident Evil or Evil Dead universes, and you fight bigger and crazier looking monsters as the levels go on. For the price this game does a great job","Feb 23, 2020 at 6:24 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:44:18.781919,diemensionx,,in 2020 this is just worth 50p played it unistalled it,"Mar 24, 2020 at 2:37 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 20:44:18.797876,ParadiseDecay,Just another generic wave shooter.,"My Initial Thoughts:
I praise the developers in my video but at the end of the day this is just another generic wave shooter.
Does what it says on the tin.

2022-05-28 20:44:18.811839,kgian76,Fast and relaxing no frills shooter,"This is a basic game but a fun nonetheless. Just grab your guns and shoot down the monsters. It is not pretending to be something else, just lets you vent. The price reflects it. Do not go into this expecting a masterpiece but what (little) it does, it does well.","Dec 24, 2019 at 5:05 PM",5, 19,
