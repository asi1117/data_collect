2022-05-28 18:13:51.434823,nsperanzo,Simply amazing,I absoluetly love the way that VR is heading! What a great way to truely understand history but to actually be in it something that we could have only dreamed of just a few years ago. Although its's just a short little clip this experience lets you truely grasp and understand what was happening in this time from the eyes of a liberator. Fantastic experience,"May 16, 2018 at 2:51 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:13:51.449782,FastLawyer,Experimental VR history done right,"So this is not the best VR experience out there, but it does a good job of what it is supposed to do:  tell a story that gets you interested.  I do wish there had been more details.  But I understand there were probably limitations on what they could present given time and money constraints.  However, I did enjoy the way the presented this historical event.  It's VR done right.","Feb 16, 2018 at 2:34 PM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 18:13:54.621300,nickladd,Great Mini-Doc,"Good visuals, good transitions. Felt like it would have been better as a standing experience  and there were a few times I really would have liked to pick things up in the environment.

2022-05-28 18:13:57.697073,Shon_t,Beautiful,"I thought the visual elements and naration were very well done. I enjoyed the archival footage, and how the story came to life. I liked some of the interactive elements, as well. 

Overall, I found the story to be a bit disjointed, and thought different parts could have been connected better. I also felt that some of the interactive elements could have been enhanced and expanded on.","Jul 14, 2017 at 4:24 AM",4, 1,
