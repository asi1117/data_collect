2022-05-28 17:28:39.164657,Saebri,These places are worth a visit,"roomscale historical experience, its not the games fault if you dont like one of the places you travel to. visuals are are still up to date and it looks great, i saw complaints about visuals but its photoscanned and 3d modelled, its not 1:1 perfect but its top tier for free and small download size. need more locations like this","May 11, 2021 at 6:17 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 17:28:39.180614,BadHombre69,Fantastic learning resource,This is very well done and robust.  A lot of commentary as the guides explain to you the history of each of these sites.  Perhaps about an hour of content.  I hope they port this over the the Quest 2 O/S so more people can experience this.  I also hope the produce more of these experiences.  Really fantastic.  Imagine if we had dozens of these sites to virtually visit!,Aug 2 at 1:35 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 17:28:39.194576,nr6542,The technology just isn't there yet.,"I'm sure they tried their best for the most part. But the models don't have enough detail, neither do the textures.
And something that IS probably their fault is that the scale of some of the 360° shots is simply off.
I also find it questionable that one has to complete the tour of Mount Rushmore before one can move on to other locations.","Feb 28, 2021 at 12:26 AM",2, 1,

2022-05-28 17:28:39.223499,Oldmancrazy,Was cool....,"but not that cool.  Its nice to see *some* of the places and I got a sense for the size and scope but the india place wasn't particularly awesome to me.  The place in the side of the cliff I spent the most time at(maybe an hour).  Rushmore was.. rushmore...(15 minutes and done).

I do fully recommend looking up the VR experience that you get to visit the tomb in the pyramid.  Forget its name but thats pretty cool if for a one shot.

I wish more of these existed because its still cool to see places I probably won't ever get to.","Jul 30, 2020 at 4:22 AM",3, 5,

2022-05-28 17:28:42.352131,FastLawyer,Amazing VR guided tours,"I would have gladly paid $20-$30 bucks for this app.  The fact that it is free and is full of content is astonishing.  The tours are absolutely jaw-dropping.  Amazing use of 3D photogrammetry.  And it's not just great visuals, there's nice ambient sounds and the knowledgeable tour guide sound recordings.  In case you're wondering, you get to tour Mesa Verde (US Pueblo), Peru, Thailand, and Mount Rushmore.   This is a must download, even if you aren't into historical sites.  This is an app you will want to show off to friends and family to get them excited about VR and the possibilities of being transported anywhere in the universe.

2022-05-28 17:28:42.366094,goesBang,Future for learning and experiencing,"This is a great demo how we could learn - in this case history - and visit historical places or monuments in the future.
It's just not possible, that many people on earth can visit all such places - this just does too much damage to the places themselves, but also to the climate etc.
And this here is the nearest thing how to allow this. It's hugely better then some photos or passive movies, where you cannot really experience the place.

Why I call it a demo? 

Not enough places - some of them even not that wellknown.
The resolution is really just too bad - I know the VR hardware is also still lagging, but the textures / photos here don't even use the headset possebilities to it#s full potential, that we have right now.

Some introduction was often missing - where are these places, how important are they, what was there role etc.","Sep 29, 2019 at 4:24 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 17:28:42.381054,PicaVR,Its a great start,"We need more like this to show and describe in detail good places to visit in this world. I think it was easy to navigate, it gives you a perspective of the place, the importance and their function. I would love to see more points to walk so its more natural and complete the experience.","Jun 19, 2019 at 9:45 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 17:28:45.480763,StephenV,This is how to preserve history!,"I finally got around to trying this out, and wow, what an unexpected thrill it has been. Truly high quality production, and the sense of immersion is exceptional. Great photogrammetry, and even the 360 photos are 3D!

Highly recommended.

2022-05-28 17:28:45.496721,BeefProsperity,,"This is one of the most powerful things about VR, being able to sit in your home and have experiences and go to places you wouldn't otherwise be able to. Very cool to listen to the various experts talk about these pieces of history while you're seeing them for yourself.","May 9, 2019 at 6:46 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:28:45.511681,ZEUS_2012,Enjoyable,"This is one of those applications of VR that I particularly enjoy.  Is it perfect? No, of course. The graphics is not always flawless, but overall the quality is good.  Hopefully, more items are going to be added.  Visiting Mount Rushmore could have been more enticing if one had been allowed to move up and down the faces instead of contenting him/herself with just watching them from given positions.  But, overall, I found the experience positive.","Jan 4, 2019 at 1:36 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 17:28:45.525643,Matthewbrennan,"Decent, but relatively uninteresting","This could have been a very, very cool experience. Unfortunately, the environments just aren't very interesting, and you're restricted to a somewhat small area to move around it. The 3D models are a decent quality, but you can clearly tell that the larger environment is just a 360-degree photo. The teleportation grid/surface and constant ""beeping"" for teleporting and aiming at things is annoying and breaks the immersion. It's hard to feel like you're ""in"" a place when it's just a 360-degree photo of a sky for the most part.","Sep 19, 2018 at 3:58 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 17:28:45.540603,Elikal,,"It is truly amazing; you can visit sights you may never see in real life, and still be there! While it is only 4 sites, you see a lot and gain a lot of information. It was worth the while.","Oct 10, 2018 at 10:28 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 17:28:48.662255,Zimmerman88,,"I would recomend this only because I have seen the amount of work that went into making this and I want to see an improved payed version as this version is just too lacking to really show people.

I would pay for:

- Higher resolutions of textures
- Unrestricted movement around the areas you have recorded so I can really explore the nooks
- A few more places if you have them","Apr 26, 2018 at 7:28 PM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 17:28:48.681204,MadMcMatt,"Amazing Potential, Must See!","This is an amazing example of a truly enjoyable and educational experience, I prefer Zombie shooters but this was amazing. I got to go places I would never otherwise see. Sure it could be higher resolution or bigger, but I think with our support programs like this will improve greatly and change how we see the world. I can't wait to see more!","May 14, 2018 at 11:06 AM",5, 4,

I love applications that make use of the technology in an educational way, and this title fits the bill. Nothing like this can ever be perfect, perfect is being there real time in the physical world, but this does as good a job as is possible. Of course I would like to see more content of the same quality and I would be happy to pay a reasonable price for it. No question that this ticks the boxes.","Mar 5, 2018 at 8:03 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 17:28:48.719102,Clickingtoenails,Very well done!,I went through this last night and absolutely loved the 360 views. Puts you right there! Most titles like this are not of this quality but give this an B+ for immersion. I will be returning to this just for the ability to enjoy the view and move around the location. One suggestion. Allow us to turn off the icons so we can return to the location just to enjoy. A simple menu click or something that turns the icons on or off.,"Feb 19, 2018 at 12:32 AM",4, 7,Thank you for the suggestion. We'll look into hiding the icons in future updates.
2022-05-28 17:28:48.734062,Elpoc,Very detailed,"It's obvious a lot of work went into this. There are some really large photogrammetry areas, and a lot of detail in the expert audio clips and comments. Unfortunately the commentary mostly fails to explain the real significance and context of much of what you're seeing, including basic things like not giving a clear idea of what time period the structures you're looking at are from. A better introduction to each of the four sites would greatly improve the experience. Also, the 3D 360 photos you can enter are not well done; the 3D seems like it may be a post-processing effect, and if you tilt your head sometimes it can cause motion sickness. In general, apps like this might do better using Lightfields tech, as Google has recently shown with 'Welcome to Lightfields'. That experience has far better resolution and sense of presence than the photogrammetry here.","Apr 4, 2018 at 1:35 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 17:28:51.821804,josh-hawk,,"I loved the experience this provided, and I can only hope more locations and history is added down the road. My oldest daughter loves history almost as much as I do and she was able to really experience it here. Great job!","Mar 27, 2018 at 10:31 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 17:28:51.836763,da7a,Fantastic!,"This is one of the best experiences on the rift, it really shows the power that VR has to transport you to another location. Its great to see VR being used for an educational use case like this. The sense of presence and immersion is excellent especially if you have a room scale set up. It feels like you are there, walking around these monuments. The audio guides give excellent insights on each location. The video on the Tested youtube channel gives some great background info for those who want to find out more about how this experience was created. I would love to see more sites added in future. Great work, well done to the team.","Feb 19, 2018 at 5:54 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 17:28:51.851723,AFassero,THE BEST VR OF REAL HISTORICAL SITES!!!,"By far the best virtual experience of real places I have ever seen.  Having been to both Mesa Verde and Mt. Rushmore in person, tourists are not allowed inside or near most of the site. This application really let's you walk ANYWHERE! The audio narration is short and to the point, and was perfect to have playing in the background while exploring. If you have any interest in history it is well worth the time!","Feb 16, 2018 at 3:48 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 17:28:51.866683,MarquisDeSang,Increase the res of mesh and textures,"This could have been the best VR experience. 3D lazer scan is not like stereoscopic pictures, it's full scanned exact 3D model (point cloud converted to textured mesh). The only thing breaking the immersion is the low textures and low mesh. And it clearly clash with the 360 images. You have the original data, just reupload it at a higher resolution. I don't care if it takes 1tb of storage on my HD it's totally worth it.","Feb 18, 2018 at 7:10 AM",4, 4,Thank you for the suggestion. We'll look into even higher-resolution versions in future updates.
2022-05-28 17:28:51.881643,Kevin_Brook,Fantastic Educational Tour,"This is a really great title and truly demonstrates the potential of virtual reality as a genuine educational/travel experience tool that goes far beyond a gimmick. I hope these kinds of titles get supported and appreciated because they are quite simply an incredible and uniquely immersive way to learn about the world around us, and visit sites that are out of reach for most of us. For those who like educational experiences like this there are a few decent ones on the Oculus Store. Google Earth is probably the best free app ever made for VR, Boulevard is a wonderful free museum/art gallery tour also available on the Oculus Store and Mission ISS is a truly must see free experience. The Smithsonian Tour of Venice is great too. Love to see more of this kind of content in VR!","Feb 17, 2018 at 9:10 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 17:28:54.981353,andrasek,Very Engaging,"I had low expectations, but I was shocked when I spent 45 minutes enjoying these ancient sites and hearing the stories.

2022-05-28 17:28:54.997310,ubu-roi,Worth Your Time,"If you're interested in historical  & archeological sites.  This gives you audio background while you're exploring a site.  You are able to go to places that are inaccessible in real life.  Great use of VR and can't wait for them to add more sites.  It's not perfect: in Mt Rushmore you need to work to get the teleporting to take you to all the locations, the camera height is sometimes at disorienting heights and other small things, but, overall, this is nice: a good blend of exploration and information.  I actually wouldn't mind more information, maybe a link to external videos explaining aspects of each site in greater detail.

They used photogrammetry, so you have an accurate 3D visualization of each site.","Feb 16, 2018 at 8:57 AM",5, 2,Thank you for the suggestions about Mt. Rushmore. We'll investigate this for future updates.
2022-05-28 17:28:55.012270,MrTee_,Nice,"No big fan of 360videos, but this is not 360 videos. This is like googlemaps down to earth with audiolessons about the place you visit. I like it a lot. I can't wait till they even manage better resoultion on this 3D scans.","Feb 16, 2018 at 11:33 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:28:55.027230,HotWasabiPeas,Neat little virtual museum experience,"Fantastic photogrammetry along with some 360 photos and interview audio clips make this one of the best virtual museum I've seen in VR.
