2022-05-28 16:26:03.390495,Fre3zy,Game is AMAZING,"This game is wonderful, with good graphics, realistic swinging, robots to kill, timed trials, etc. BUT, there needs to be more content, honestly.

2022-05-28 16:26:03.404458,kari_bjorn,"Huge potential, still kinda bad","It's an official Spider-Man VR game, and the swinging is okay. Even though it's just like using a grapple hook, it gets fun at times. The only problem I have is when I create web walls when trying to swing faster in time trials. You can't move left or right or even backwards. It just snap turns you in the direction you moved the thumbstick. Not much to do (except for collecting pins and completing a few challenges) so I'll give this a 4/10.",Apr 13 at 10:06 PM,3, 24,

2022-05-28 16:26:06.573980,jtchain,Everything besides swinging is not good.,"The swinging in this game is great, but the way you move on the ground in this game can get annoying. For example, whenever you try to walk left or right, it blinks your camera left and right, even on immersive settings. You also cant walk backwards. I think its good that the game has settings for people who get motion sick, but it would be nice to have settings for people who dont.",Dec 22 at 1:48 AM,4, 276,

2022-05-28 16:26:09.764447,GalaxyVr,It's Fun but good be better,"This game is great of it being a free game but it can be repetitive. The storymode it about 10-15 minutes long and the only fun and consistant part is the free play mode. After you beat the story mode it gives you a new suit (it isen't very diffrent) and when you try again it just loops and thats it. The free play mode is just you as spider man swinging around Harlem but that is still fun. The quality of the swinging is great depending on it being a free game though. I forgot to mention but in the free mode there are time trails, cobat trials and more. Overall the game is great but good get some updates and better story mode, that would cause the game to be paid but I would like that more if it had more story.",Nov 8 at 9:20 AM,4, 193,

2022-05-28 16:26:09.793369,Rotius,"It had potential, but that's about it.","This game seemed great. I could swing around like Spider-Man. Unfortunately, this was somehow done wrong. The game exclusively has snap-turning because everyone in VR has severe motion sickness and everyone in VR has space to turn their bodies, swing their arms in any direction, and are not attached to a short cable that's behind them.

On top of that, the swinging was half-assed and felt like something straight out of Gmod and the movement is something straight out of a horror movie. By that, I mean I'm terrified of anyone who thinks only being able to move forward is a good thing. The only person I know who doesn't use the A and D keys when on PC or flick the motion stick to the side when turning is my mom.

With terrible movement, the mirror bit, terrible turning, half-assed swinging, and nothing to even hook me in, this was a complete waste of the time I spent playing this game. I have it uninstalled and don't plan on ever trying it again.",Dec 16 at 7:43 PM,1, 12,

2022-05-28 16:26:22.385689,Occpaul495843,Let me choose how to turn,"Ok, first of all this is a great concept for VR,  Actually being in the game and playing Spider Man in the first person view is extremely immersive and the web swinging and mechanics are very fun and done well for the most part. This is also a free program so I am not writing a review to discourage anyone from playing this, it is a cool concept and it is a great demo for the most part. 
 The part that makes me want to uninstall it and never play it again is something that might seem a minor detail, but for me it completely destroys the demo and experience. 
 The way they decided to control rotating your character is with quick instant 90 degree turns. There is no option to shut this off so that you can simply rotate your character, every time you turn you have do a quick, instant 90 degree teleport.  For me personally this turned what started off as a lot of fun into instant loathing. 
First off, I do not like this mechanic in general, I do not like it in VR games period so this is my personal preference. The reason why I do not like it in most games is because it completely destroys the immersion into what I am playin., As human beings when we turn our heads and our body we cannot instantly teleport and rotate our bodies in a 90 degree turn. In this experience/demo it is an extremely terrible design choice because we have to use our stick on the controller to climb walls or run forward so if you are climbing the wall or running sometimes you might accidentaly rotate your character by accidentaly bumping the trigger to the left or to the right and if you do a couple in a row or just wind up at a bad view angle you can lose track of the direction you were going.  Also if you do a quick rotate and you wind up at an angle that is different from the way you want to go you might not be lined up right, you might have the body angled to the left or right of the way you want to be facing. Let me decide how I want my character to turn,terrible design choice.",Sep 9 at 11:14 AM,1, 53,

2022-05-28 16:26:35.015908,mattysparkles,Great game but needs Quest 2 port,"I got to play this game for about 20 minutes the day before my house burned down with my rift s and everything else inside. I enjoyed it so much I went out and bought a quest 2 to keep me busy at the hotel I was staying in only to find out this game and others are only on rift platform. Then I also found out I had to rebuy a bunch of the games I already purchased for the rift s to play on the quest 2 apparently Facebook considers them different platforms so you have to purchase the game all over again. I wasn't happy. Superhot on Oculus rift s is the same game as on Oculus quest 2 but according to Facebook they're different so I had to pay for it twice. That makes less than 0 sense and even after explaining the situation to support they couldn't grant me a couple free games even though it doesn't cost them anything being a digital download and not a physical product, and knowing I just went through a traged. It wasn't enough for them that I then continued to support the brand and l went out and spent another 300$ to buy my 5th Oculus device 2 x Go 1 x Samsung Gear VR 1 x rift s and now 2 x quest2 (first quest2 mic just randomly stopped working after 3 weeks and the following day the video stopped working the support was taking to long between responses I bought another headset) I'm sure it'll take forever to get RMA approval and get a repaired unit back in my hands... Prove me wrong facebook. Also back to the point, please give us a quest 2 port of the spiderman game and make it more robust with an epic  campaign mode. 

go get licenses and make other avenger games in VR that culminate in a epic multiplayer / multi game co op avengers campaign. Do that I'll buy six more headsets and copies of the same games for all of them.","Jun 20, 2021 at 2:35 PM",5, 323,

The main reason 2 stars got knocked off was for the horrible movement system they've implemented. in every other VR game, the left stick works as any other first person game should. left strafes left, right strafes right, backwards makes you go backwards. that is not how this game works. the only movment you have is forward. the right stick AND the left stick will snap turn you if you press anything other than forward. it would be really nice to have the ability to , you know, move backwards and sideways into an alley when both of my webshooters are disabled so i can have an idea of where they are. super frustrating movment system.","May 3, 2021 at 1:58 AM",3, 28,

2022-05-28 16:27:03.459831,IndyGamerTag,Wacky controls and rarely any direction,"It was fun in the beginning when you got to free roam and swing around. Then combat ruins the whole game. When I started chasing and trying to web up the robot, things got frusturating. Both joysticks turn your camera, even though one is supposed to be assigned motion and the other is the ""snap movement"" they both snap you in any direction. Meaning I have to try and move around keeping up with the flying robots while also not trying to snap my camera view and have to reaquire my target. A MUST for any VR game is smooth turning, and for a dang good reason. This game's lack of it and similar ""web wall"" controls to swinging controls break it for me. One minute Im trying to web wall and the next im thrust forward because it thought I wanted to swing even though I never threw my arms back. All that was needed was hold ""enter random button here"" button and put hands together and web wall will activate. Not to mention the lack of direction at somepoints. Ned says to ""destroy the armor"" so I start web shooting and it only chnages to a cracked asthetic. Only when I change it up to a ""web wall"" type motion does it instantly break off. Yet I was never told to do this. Then ned says we gotta run him into a dead end, yet it never comes. The minutes into simply chasing after the robot does a message appear saying ""hey web wall is used ""like this"", denoting what is needed to trap him. In the middle of the street with no dead ends in sight. This reeks of high school computing class and a strict deadline they weren't ready for.",Jul 4 at 10:27 AM,1, 1,

You can't turn smoothly, even in options, and the webs don't allow you to swing from objects as much as they propell you towards them. they feel more like grappling hooks. free is free though, I can't complain, but with a bit of polish, this would be a game worth charging for.

2022-05-28 16:27:06.626362,Expired_Player,Probably the worst VR game I've played,"There is little to none settings that you can actualy customize. The snap turning made the gameplay really bad, I kept getting turned around whenever i wanted to move how you normally would in a vr game. I understand it was free but still godamn. As I beileve it snap turning is ment to help players with motion sickness but this just got me feeling sick to my stomach.  And I never get sick in a vr game so this is a new expirence.


When i first started the game up the height was off by alot. Im not saying the floor wasnt where it should be. or my head was to high. it made my character crouch and arch his back so it looked like i only had hands and thighs. Now I may not be tall (5'6 age 12) But still like are you kidding me?  I cant explain to you how weird it looked. Now this would not have been a problem if they let you customize these things in the setting but again, there were little to none settings.


The reason I gave it a two star is because it found My 2 biggest pet peeves in vr games. Snap turning, and not being able to customize things that affect gameplay. 

But. I will give it credit. Besides all the other stuff it really does have great potential, and I really do think i'd love this game if they had simply let you customize things a bit. it gives you an oppurtunity for those who have always wanted to beat up bad guys and swing out till your heart drops. A childhood dream being lived out as close to real life as possible.


TL;DR: There is 0 movement settings- scratch that settings in general, the snap turning turns my stomach. BUT, I do think it has potential to be a great game being able to live out your childhood dream.","May 16, 2021 at 3:04 PM",2, 5,

The graphics are pretty terrible for everything but the spidey model (which you're the head of) there's no language controls, so if you want it in a different language to what your computer is set to, you're screwed. You can't adjust head height, and for some reason it didn't recognize the height I set my floor, so I was technically playing from inside Spidey's chest which looking at the hands interesting. All in all, it feels like a super rushed movie tie-in that makes no sense considering how long it's been since Far From Home was released.","Apr 4, 2021 at 4:52 PM",2, 3,

 The story is incredibly short - you essentially use a combination of swinging, shooting web, and using a wall ability, and it's just one boss fight.  However, the freeplay mode is pretty neat swinging through and scaling buildings in Manhattan.  There are a few minigames after the quick story - Honestly, I wish there was more!  If the story was fleshed out a bit more, or more minigames were added, I don't think anyone would have have any qualms paying for an experience like that.  

Also, I also appreciate that there are various accessibility options for those who may not have their VR legs, like vignetting while in motion.  You can definitely turn it all off (the Immersive setting does that for you), but be ready for it - I could see many VR users getting sick from that!","Apr 2, 2021 at 9:30 PM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 16:27:44.549930,SplendidFate,Insanely frustrating experience.,"There is a short tutorial at the beginning that works well enough. Then the next sequence you get to swing around the city for about a minute before an evil robot attacks. You're supposed to hit him with your web shooters (which you have to constantly reload), but drones keep shooting lasers at your web shooters and disabling them for 10 or 15 seconds. During which time you cant do anything. By the time they come back online again you barely have a chance to reload them or pull off a shot before they are disabled again. I can't believe that this is supposed to actually be a promo for a movie meant to appeal to a wide audience, including (presumably) users who may not necessarily be all that experienced in VR. I couldnt imagine letting a new or novice user trying this game. By the time I finished that first boss battle, I was done and did not want to even try the free play modes. This game is a total fail. I realize that it was free, but being that it is meant to be a promo for a big budget film, I feel it is more open to scrutiny than other free games. Bullet Train (the free promo for Robo Recall) was way better than this.","Nov 3, 2020 at 1:48 PM",1, 5,

2022-05-28 16:28:16.253135,Kryllic,"Super fun, but a couple critiques.","This game is no doubt fun. I really enjoy swiming around the city and feeling like Spiderman, and the combat and racing trials can give you some stuff to do. But, there is a reason I'm giving it a 4 star, because I have a couple of main critique about this game, nothing ""bad"" though.

The problem I have is with the actual web swinging. It's fun and functional, but the physics feel off. Typically, when you imagine ""swinging"" from a web or rope, the way it works is that you continue to fall downward until the rope's strength catches you, and your momentum carries you forward in an arc fasion. In this game, however, when you shoot your web and it anchors to a point, like on the side of a building, instead of continuing to fall downward until the web catches you, you instead start to ""reel"" toward's the anchor point. So, essentially, you can fall, shoot a web to the side of a building, then just hold it and you'll basically ""fly"" right to where your web landed. Gravity still takes effect, but only somewhat, so when you want to actually webswing, it feels pretty floaty.

The other issue I have, though not as bad as the first, is how you reload your web. To reload, you have to shoot your web out of your sights, like behind your back. At first, I did think this was a pretty neat and fun idea. But, as you get more experienced with swinging around the city, and attempting cooler tricks, you quickly realize how annoying it can get when you want to swing or shoot your web to something off to the side of you, but instead you just reload. I think a very easy alternative, could be a dedicated button to reloading, as right now, all of the face buttons on the controller are just to jump.

I understand, it's a free game, hence why I think it's great for the content it gives you. But, if they decide to actually make a full length paid game out of this concept, I would really like to see them improve the web swinging physics and fix the reloading.","Aug 18, 2019 at 4:43 AM",4, 24,

2022-05-28 16:28:22.580212,Mlepic1114,Spectacular.,"I had my doubts at first about the swinging, but it is actually not that bad. It isn't perfect by any means (the locomotion isn't the best), but it is not horrible. The game is very fun (even though the story is short). The freeplay will make you want to come back, as it has combat trials and racing. It is, overall, a very exciting Spider-Man experience. It is probably the best Spider-Man experience in VR as of right now. 
PROS:
The good parts about it are the movement and webbing. You can wall run (which works really well), and you can use web bullets (quickly firing webs). You can also use two webs connect to a building to create a web wall. This is very innovative and I love it. The map size is also fairly decent (even though, yes, there are barriers, it still feels as if you are in NY).
CON:
The one big problem I have with it is looking around. When using the analog sticks to look around, the screen fades to black for a quick sec, and sometimes it can be aggrivating during swinging. I would prefer is the analog would simply move in the direction you would want with the left stick and the right stick would make you turn, but without the black screen and immediate switch to another position. If you want a good example, there is an option in another VR game, GORN, that can do what I am trying to say.

Besides that, great game. (One problem. The time trial with the short buildings is impossible. No one has been able to beat it because the time you have to beat it is too small. Devs, if you are reading this, fix it!)","Jun 30, 2019 at 8:44 AM",4, 30,

I know at least a good majority of you will say yes. This experience aims to provide that, but remember, this is just a promotion for a movie. First off, hand tracking is pretty off. You kinda dont notice it if you really are going at it but its pretty bothersome. The city is rather... dead. I have seen only ONE pedestrian so far. Cars going sure but I wish the city had been more... immersive. However, unlike the last experience which was more of a tease than anything, we are provided with an actual bossfight... against a giant robot covered in armor. The fight seems pretty intimidating at first until you realize it does nothing to attack you. In fact your just chasing it the whole time, webbing up its armor then pulling it off. I found this rather anticlimatic but hey, not like they are gonna change anything, it is again, a movie promotion. The graphics arent incredible, they are just kinda enough to be immersive... as long as you dont stand still for too long. Still, this is worth a look at all the same. But if you REALLY want a spider man vr experience, theres an avengers game for that.","Jun 26, 2019 at 1:43 AM",3, 23,
2022-05-28 16:28:22.613124,Snake-Plissken,Worth every bit of free,"The story took less than 10 minutes, then free roam just has 1 time trial and 1 combat trial that consists of shooting down drones. The game does not have web swinging, it has web zipping. I have tried all the various settings and when web ""swinging"", you actually just pull yourself towards what the web is attached to. This made the time trial a chore. There are other suits, but besides beating the story and unlocking one, there is no mention of how to get the others. The city also has a barrier, so free roam isn't too expanded.

For a free game, it's not bad. I don't know that it would even be worth $5, but they could easily use this as a base to make a full $40-$50 game.","Jun 27, 2019 at 3:15 PM",3, 32,

However, I would like to see a bit more of a storyline that follows the film a little bit closer. Sure it's got drones, Ned and Peter but that's about it (the enemy in the game doesn't appear in Far from Home. I get that it's only an experience and it would take quite a while to do, but I would love to see a more finished looking New York rather than a generic looking city (the buildings are 6 or 7 different models replicated to make a bigger city). After the detail in Peter's room and replicating the buildings outside I was slightly underwhelmed when I saw the city.
Still for a free game it is absolutely brilliant and it is definately worth a try (maybe not for people afraid of heights).

I would definately be interested in a paid game that had a bit more finish to it and maybe a longer and more in depth storyline.","Aug 28, 2019 at 11:27 PM",4, 0,

You just seem to 'float' through the air slowly rather than swing. The swinging really doesn't feel responsive and the whole climb / jump system is not a good combination.

Was this a full game, this might just be the quintessential VR killer-app. It's honestly that good.

I've had a stupid smile on my face the whole time, even though I was just free-roaming a pretty bland but sprawling version of Manhattan, doing nothing but zipping around and seeing how long I could last before ungracefully bumping into another skyscraper.

I won't repeat the facts about this being a rather simple free-to-play movie ad with very limited story-mode and time trials / shoot-em-up trials, but rather would like to point out the only thing that bothered me a little: even though it works flawlessly most of the time - the swinging could need some improvement. Your web-slinging feels like using grappling hooks and the trademark pendulum motion of the character doesn't really work. Instead of giving you the nauseating feeling of a drop while picking up speed, you just miraculously levitate to your target in a straight line. It works - and with practice you can fine-tune your movement to an elegant workout - but the short (non-interactive) sequence at the end of the last game sold the experience a tad better.

Mind you: this is in no way a deal-breaker, so I can recommend this game to its fullest! Please, Sony, you've got the perfect licence on your hands. All you have to do is point your web-shooters and reel it in.","Aug 9, 2019 at 6:00 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 16:28:35.337092,VR_Ghost,A Four Star Experience With A Flaw,"Another great Spider-Man experience without a doubt, but unfortunately brought down by a web swinging mechanic that pulls you out of the immersion every time you pull the trigger.

There's no denying this is a great and immersive Spider-Man experience that is as close to the feeling of being Spider-Man as we have ever gotten. You can even load up Free Play mode and just swing around the city to your hearts content.

Unfortunately, the oddly implemented web swinging mechanic pulls you out of the experience every time you use it, which is just about the entire time.

For some reason the developers chose to have webs behave sort of like a grappling hook that pulls you toward the webs anchor point while you are swinging, almost eliminating the need to actually swing at all. You can just sort of pull yourself through the air, and the problem with this is, it just feels wrong, looks wrong, and you will probably be thinking that every time you use your web slingers, completely destroying the immersion.

If the grappling web mechanic was needed for gameplay reasons it should have had it's own seperate control, such as pulling the trigger and then pressing the grip button to pull yourself up the web. However changing the core physics of how Spider-Man travels seems to be an overstep on the part of the developers that I think most will not find to be a welcome one.

That issue aside, this demo showing the possibilities of how great a full Spider-Man VR game could be, definitely hits the mark. We get to feel like we are Spider-Man while playing, and if we had some villains, a story, and a more fleshed out city that felt alive, it could be...well....AMAZING!","Jul 17, 2019 at 4:45 AM",3, 2,

While it doesn't make you crave the movie, it might make you crave a Spider-Man VR game. The controls with Touch are a bit weird (push either stick forward to run, push either stick in any direction other than forward to snap turn, click any face button to jump), and I would appreciate an option to change them. 

For some reason, certain actions behave differently on the PS4 version of the game. On PS4, while on the ground, if I web a point on the ground (say) 10m away, and yank at it, I'll fly through the air and land exactly halfway between where I was and where the web was. This unfortunately doesn't exist on the PC version.

Other than that, it's super easy to get into, and could make for a great relaxation app, or even to show some guests VR. This is leaps and bounds more engaging than the Homecoming experience, which felt more like a glorified interactive ad, so I would definitely recommend this if you've got the space on your hard drive, and your VR legs, as this is one of the more motion intensive games I've played.","Jul 4, 2019 at 7:44 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 16:28:47.950356,adam.poole.313,Great potential... with some tweaks,"This is basically a tech demo but a great one.  They could make an amazing open city game with this. The models are all low quality  and its rough around the edges but the core functions are there.

There are a few things that they could change that would help alot. It is bad form to make both sticks control snap turns. Anytime you try to walk forward you accidentally snap turn repeatedly and is borderline game breaking.

The other major tweak is with the way you swing.  If you hold a swing long enough and have enough height then you will actually do an arc and it feels right. But the majority of the time it feels more like you are just flying and have to periodically shoot a wall to keep yourself in the air. It operates more like a grappling hook that just pulls your flight in that direction.

For a free experience there is nothing better. I hope they turn this into an actual game.","Jul 8, 2019 at 1:07 PM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 16:28:51.059042,Leonius,"Worth it, but some truly sadistic design","Free physics-based swinging video game fans have fantasized about since Spider-Man 2 on PS2, you can experience yourself?! Uh yeah, definitely. 

That said, I was surprised to find this short experience has some of the most devilish, sadistic, and because this is VR, literally physically punishing features in any video game I've played. 

What am I talking about? Well, there are 5 time trials and 5 combat trials (not 1 of each like some reviews suggest) - you just have to scan the area for them, and because draw distance is variable based on computer power, you might think there can only be one (#highlander), but just keep swinging and pulling your arms, stopping, and scanning till you see more.

Combat trials are a piece of cake. In fact (and I totally get this was probably rushed for the movie) enemies spawn in one point and you web 'em up no prob. 

Time trials though?! You know how in most games with this, you miss a checkpoint or time, you just get a button prompt to try again? Oh no, not here - if you miss physically swinging through a checkpoint, THAT checkpoint you missed becomes your ""Retry?"" window. You have to somehow make it to that.

And oh yeah, you have about 10-15 seconds before it DISAPPEARS and you have to navigate your way back to the starting point.

And oh yeah, THAT BOX FOR SOME REASON BECOMES SMALLER IF YOU WANT TO RETRY. What? I truly don't understand why this included as a feature in this game.

To summarize, you flap your arms wildly to try to get a time trial, and you miss. Wanna try again? Frantically flap your body to try to make it into a smaller box suspended in mid-air, and watch as it disappears in front of you right as you're about to get into it.

Also, there are 25 pins to collect, they're small, there's no info at all about where they might be, and draw distance dictates you won't see them until you're right on them. The scanner does not scan them.

Anyway, great game, your shoulders will hurt like hell, but you'll be jacked.","Jul 3, 2019 at 10:02 AM",4, 3,

When swinging works, it works great and feels good especially because the game pulls a Spiderman PS4 and the music kicks in when you start swinging, but the fact that I feel the urge to compare it to Superman 64 hurts me to say.

I originally gave this a 5 star despite that, but the more I think about it, the more it blows my mind how awful the controls are. Every time I think of this game's awful controls, I just must lower the score. The inability to straif or move in any direction you are not facing is crippling. YOU CAN'T EVEN MOVE BACKWARDS! However, the webslinging is the best webslinging since that fanmade attack on titan game and that alone makes this a great game in its own right.

I have already played it a bunch of times.  The amazing thing is how realistic the swinging is.  If you pull your arms down faster it actaully flings you higher and faster into the swing.  Very cool.  But probably the best part is getting my friends to try and run off the first roof.  Some just wont do it becasue the heights bother them.  I will admit it is freaky the first time walking to the edge of the building and looking over first before jumping.  Also try climbing the spire at the top of the building for a really cool view.

Also, only fighting drones in the free-roam mode gets a little boring. It'd be great if there was a car chase event or random muggings that you could stop every once in a while, just to change things up. Obviously that is asking a lot for a FREE Spiderman experience, but even if it was a 1$ or 2$ DLC to come out later, the foundation they have created with this tie-in is simply stunning. I've already spent several hours in it and can't wait to spend more! I really hope that when a true VR Spiderman Game comes to PC, it'll have webslinging mechanics like this, there's something truly special here. Job well done, devs! Give yourselves a pat on the back.","Jun 27, 2019 at 8:04 AM",4, 1,
