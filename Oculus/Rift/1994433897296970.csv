2022-05-28 13:37:22.330555,Rageinthecage77,could have been better,This game could have been one of the greatest.at first i almost got a refund but gave it a chance.the game looks good but i feel like after the helm looking out to the ship its just a big screen but once into the game i kinda became use to it idk how to describe it it just looks cheap like a 360 video but this game is fun.its got so much potential,"Jun 26, 2020 at 12:11 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 13:37:22.344516,Alaxians,This game is amazing,Yo we need a quick update on this game cuz multiplayer is unplayable cuz no ones playing it. I think they should add a campaign 2 or maybe even a 3 because the I think the storytelling was really good!!,"Jun 23, 2020 at 8:58 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 13:37:22.359476,JackDiddley,Should Have Been Better,"The most underrated genre in gaming makes it to VR.  This is a difficult game to review.  I wanted to like it more, but I have to admit it is quite fun despite its many shortcomings.
It is NOT the RPG I was hoping for.  There is no progress building, or customization.  The worst thing about this game is how very random it is.  I played through all of the campaign missions, pretty reprtative, and you are locked into the captains and ships available.
For the battle mode you can mix and match captains and ships.  Each ship has three upgrade slots and it takes a lot of grinding to get them upgraded.  Between rounds of battle mode you may randomly get a ship upgrade.  No explanation or comparison to what you have (shouldn't chain shot break sails and masts?), and when you come across one you like you may or may not randomly get it next time you play.  I still have no idea what leveling up captains does for gameplay.  
It is a  fun arcade style ship battle game, worth about half of what they are charging for it... unfortunately.","Apr 19, 2020 at 5:59 AM",3, 41,
2022-05-28 13:37:22.374437,Yofreaky,Blackouts,"I love this game, for the few minutes I got to enjoy it I fell in love. However, right after the third ship in the first level of the campaign my game always crashes with a blackout forcing me to shut down my computer manually, breaking me C: drive. Two times in a row it did this because all other times it has blackouted on launch. Also damaging my C:. I don't think it's an issue with this game but I have never had the issue until I bought the game. As soon as I get this fixed it deserves 5 stars.","May 22, 2020 at 12:09 PM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 13:37:25.513119,Coledaddy007,So much fun!,"I love my Rift-S, and I have a fair amount of games.  This game is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  First off, you can play it standing or sitting, which as a close to 40 year old man, does make a difference when I don't want to break sweat.  The game is very straight forward.  You control a pirate ship from the helm, using one hand to steer and the other hand to direct your cannons, turrets and guns.  You have two special abilities that are easy to trigger, and you can drop your anchors to simulate quick stopping or e-brake-eque turns.  There's a great campaign mode which you can do with another player, and then a battle mode with up to 4 players where you experience increasingly difficult levels (think horde mode from Gears of War).  This is incredibly fun, and a very arcade style of play that lends itself to quickly learning.  Each pirate captian and ship can also be leveled up the more you play with them, so there's a lot of replay value so far for me.   I haven't tried the multiplayer versus mode yet, but I imagine that will be a blast.  Don't hesitate to download this game.","Mar 21, 2020 at 12:52 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 13:37:25.528079,VirtuallyThere,i cant find a match,i tried to play a match but when i join its just an empty lobby i wouldnt even pay money for this game dont waste your money when you cant even play.,"Mar 21, 2020 at 5:13 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 13:37:25.543039,Glitch Fandango,"A lot of potential, but underwhelming.","I've been interested in this one for a while but the other reviews have put me off. It went on sale (52% off) this week so i figured I'd give it a go, and if you can get it at that price it's probably worth keeping. Probably.

The first hour or so was really good. It's quite unlike anything else I've played which is a bonus, and the concept itself has a load of potential. But Survios, as usual, have decided that instead of putting together a really good game for the home use market, they would focus on a really surface level experience for their arcades. Sigh.

With just a few more features and just a little more complexity this could have been a really amazing game, but unfortunately the gameplay ran into very shallow water. This is the type of game that if you paid for a 20 minute session at a Survios arcade you'd probably think it was excellent, but you realise pretty quickly when you've bought it at home that it gets repetative fast. 

All they would have needed would be to add a few more weapon types, a slightly more complex damage system (i.e damage to sails or masts etc effecting speed etc), increased the penalty for running aground/into iceburgs, add 1 or 2 more ships/captains and a few more mission types and this game would have been a real winner.

As it is, only grab it on sale, and even then only if £11 is something that you can spare easily. For me, the question is ""Will i get as much value from this game as i would from 2 pints at the pub?"" I'd say so. Will i get more than that? Probably not...","Jun 17, 2020 at 9:17 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 13:37:25.558996,trgz,Arrrrr,"Excellent co-op game - simple to set-up a friends-only game.
Pretty comfortable - no motion sickness.
About 2 hours to complete the full campaign (as a beginner)
Good value (in a sale)
Should be fun to replay a few times (I've not tried multiplayer)
As engaging to play as that Star Trek game.","Dec 10, 2019 at 5:11 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 13:37:25.573956,Plumpi,Buy this game,"Did you like Furious Seas or other seafaring vr games? Want to live out your dream of stepping into the shoes of a captain in Assassin's Creed: Black Flag? This is it chief. The scale of your ship and the expanse of the open sea makes me feel like I'm playing VR for the first time again. Steering the ship and firing your cannons is easy to learn but hard to master. The campaign isn't too difficult, but you'll want to up your game for multiplayer matches. They don't show you mercy there. The graphics are cartoon-ish, but that's a good thing in this case. Unlocking captains and making your ship stronger incentivises you to keep playing the campagin and the warfaring modes. The multiplayer isn't very active, as I'm writing this review on launch day. However, this game has the potential to blow up--I just hope it does. Thanks Survios for all your effort in bringing us polished VR titles!

[UPDATE]
Just a day after launch, I'm instantly finding multiplayer matches--happy sailing!","Sep 12, 2019 at 12:20 PM",5, 91,
2022-05-28 13:37:28.668755,Slick1984,Different Type of Game,"My goal is to have a very diverse VR library and this game fills a hole in that library. 

I've only played the 1st two campaign missions and enjoyed them. Like just about all VR games, the 1st campaign mission is mostly tutorial. But, I was surprised by how much the difficulty ramped up between mission one and mission two. I completed the 2nd mission on my 2nd play-through. Like I said, I was surprised by the difficulty.

The campaigns consist of four different captains/ships with five different missions each. So far, the first captain is funny. I am going to assume that all of the captains are funny. It's not a straight forward, sink all ships (offensive) type of game. There is a lot of stuff in the water to avoid. There are also, flaming explosive ships, to avoid, that try to ram your ship. Yes, you can ram other ships, as well.

I have not tried multi-player, yet. I like to know what I'm doing before getting my butt kicked.

Motion-sickness - I didn't experience any motion-sickness, at all. The default is to limit the vision on turns, for those that get motion-sickness. I do get motion-sickness on some games, but not this one and I turned-off the assist.

tldnr; It's different and fun. Oh and it looks great, too!","Sep 25, 2019 at 9:26 AM",4, 14,
2022-05-28 13:37:28.683715,Painface95,okay but not for that price,"Campaign gets really boring really fast. Every Mission plays pretty much the same.
I cant find people to play online and even when it says ""game found"" its just an empty lobby.
Also, I would have liked a bit more polish, for example you cant move your fingers. Its a Minor thing I know, but stuff like that bothers me.
All in all the game plays not bad. Cleary there went alot of effort into it, but it is definatly not worth the 30 Euros I payed for it. Wait for a sale.","Oct 13, 2019 at 6:58 PM",3, 7,

My Initial Thoughts:
I'm a big fan of Survios who make some excellent VR games and who know NO limits. 
This is a visually impressive and fun pirate ship combat arcade extravaganza.
I just hope they add bots for mulitplayer/PVP as I was struggling to find other people at the time of my impressions video!","Sep 11, 2019 at 11:54 PM",4, 16,
2022-05-28 13:37:28.714633,xCHRONICxGRIMEx,4 Stars for now.. Awesome game though,"So this game def had potential to be a 5 star game, which I fully intend on making it a 5 rating if people actually start to play it. The controls are awesome, like the previous review its like playing black flag/sea of theives, but in VR. The story seems like its going to be decently long with different characters to play through the campaign and these different characters have their own specials and perks. 

update!!! multiplayer matches found!! totally worth the buy specially if you got it when it was on sale. lets get it!!


I am really looking forward to the online though, it has so much potential the only downfall is no one is playing, there is co op and deathmatch, and one other mode. if you liked black flag, sea of theives or KH3 when you are in the pirates world then you will with out a doubt enjoy this game. Also, its on sale right now so this is the time to pick this game up. I need people to play with lmao","Sep 16, 2019 at 6:16 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 13:37:28.729592,Masamune5454,Not thier best vr game.,"now i dont like being negative in a review about a survios project or game, but i feel this game should have been better. its very shallow, and doesnt offer a whole lot. the campaign is not long, and multiplayer im guessing is just with a second ship beside you so i didnt bother. well i did but after 2 minutes on each i gave up.
the gameplay just needs to be deeper. basically the game has you sit on a boat, point your hands to aim and pull the left and right anchors(for quick turns) and the steering wheel is quite cool, although the 4th characters hands dont fit it at all, like the steering  is 1/5 the size of the circle she makes with her hand to grab the wheel. theres alot of polish to survios games and it shows here.

combat is fun, but shallow agian. the crew cant be interacted with at all and the powers are set to each character with thier physical appearance matching, but the ships are this way too. as i see it the ships have different weapons to and one for each character, they can be upgraded three times. heres where i got dissapointed. the whole game is point and click with your hand, could they at least have made it so the characters or ships(mainly ships) where customizable. it would have been so much cooler to have your own ship that you made, with armor and little personal hand cannons, maybe some items, i mean the game needs some more interactable things on the ship to occupy you. maybe some musical instruments or just stuff to toy with.
all in all its a fun game, but i dont know if its for me. it is a pirate ship VR game after all.","Sep 12, 2019 at 12:00 PM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 13:37:31.841873,Shiro-Nyaa,not worth it,"the game just isnt worth it in my opinion campain is fun but after that you are pretty mutch done whit the game ther realy isnt anything that keeps you playing 
online mode just doesnt work tried to find a game for like 4-5 hours and when it finnaly found a game i got in a 10 v 10 match whit only 1 player... the game doesnt add any AI if i coud still ask for a refund i would do so... this game is add best worth 10 euro woulnd spend more on this and yeah the rest of the game mode is pretty mutch a repead mission evry time","Sep 20, 2019 at 4:46 AM",1, 3,

However, the next day I started the game back up and I was back to the first mission. Is there anyway to gain my progress back, other than having ot complete all the missions again?","Sep 15, 2019 at 2:01 AM",4, 4,"Hey Hecticneo, sorry to hear you experienced this issue with your save progress in Battlewake's Campaign.

2022-05-28 13:37:31.871793,ian.newson,Fun but I have audio issues,"I use Bluetooth headphone with my rift, and in this game I get no sound in them. The only way I get audio is by switching the audio output to separate speakers which isn't great for immersion. I had the same issue with creed as well but in no other games, so it's something specific to survios games.

However what I've played was fun, although maybe not in the same league as creed and raw data.","Sep 12, 2019 at 12:34 AM",3, 5,

2022-05-28 13:37:31.902710,Aqua-VR,Really enjoying this,"I've only played a few missions so far, but this game is unique and fun compared to other games I've played in VR. Can't think of any complaints. Thanks for supporting crossbuy, that's what made me decide to try it","Sep 12, 2019 at 1:32 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 13:37:35.015533,Crazyhair,Not like Black Flag,"Who ever said this game was like Black Flag never played Black Flag. I was looking for a pirate adventure and I still am. This is an arcade wave shooter which still is a decent game with great graphics and some battles. Unfortunatly all the battles are the same exact ones just a different location.

Pros...Good graphics 
good ships and wave experience in the water
Able to improve ships, artillery, and spells some what
Even though its the same exact battle every time, it can be fun.
I'm sure its not easy to make games in VR for which this game has some credit.

Cons..
For myself and possibly others I am looking for a pirate adventure, this is a wave shooter game. 
The ships wheel is very buggy,  too many times the spell would activate without ever pressing the button, I made sure of it. You can't turn the wheel with one hand  and keep it turned so you can fire a weapon. (yes I'm holding on to it.) The wheel is released every time if you don't use both hands. The Oculus main screen pops up without pressing the button. 
Every single battle is the same exact battle in the same exact sequence, the position of the ships, the vocals, just a different location. I am up to level 7 with one captain and its wash, rinse, repeat over and over! Although I win all the battles level 7 seems to be it. 
There is no exploration, or controling the speed of the ship by lowering some sails. Its just stear the ship aim and fire at the same constant speed.
I don't feel its worth the price.","Oct 4, 2019 at 1:47 AM",3, 10,
