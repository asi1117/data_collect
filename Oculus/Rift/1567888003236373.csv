2022-05-28 19:47:15.036274,petr.cina,Needs more development,The controls are a bit unfinished. The controls arent very fluent and navigating through the map is difficult. It would be better if the controls were easier and objective more clear.,"Apr 11, 2018 at 5:44 AM",3, 0,"Thanks, I'll definitely take that into account before I release from Early Access."
2022-05-28 19:47:15.060210,YiKwang,A Potential Must-Have for Purist Gamers,"This is a great new theme for a classic form of game. The 3D update is of course very enjoyable but the addition of VR brings an immersiveness that you wouldn't neccessarily expect from this kind of game. Suffice it to say- the geometry of the game benefits greatly from your position within the game world. However, this brings me to my downside... The camera angles of the game are not very comfortable and personally, I find the player movement mechanic to be incredibly frustrating. One must grip the edges of the 'crust' of the levels and drag one's self around and I cannot for the life of me find a way to rotate around the point I'm looking at. If this game had simple Left Analogue Movement and Right Analogue Rotation, I would happily give it 5 stars - but as it is I am tempted to go down to 3.","Jan 18, 2018 at 12:11 AM",4, 2,"Thank you! 
I'll definitely implement those before I release out of Early Access!"
2022-05-28 19:47:15.077164,foresterr,Great idea but needs improvements,"Basic concept of Lemmings in VR works great. However, the control scheme definitely needs improvements. My suggestions: when grabbing, grab the gnome closest to the center of the hand; highlight the gnome about to be grabbed; USE TRIGGERS (they would be perfect for grabbing gnomes - pinching them by the collar optional - instead of grabbing being confused with use of the special powers). Also, I think using the powers would be much more satisfying if you had to tap a gnome with pointing index finger gesture while keeping the grip pressed to activate it, instead of just tapping grip while pointing from a distance :) I'll keep going back and checking how the game progresses!","Jul 8, 2017 at 4:57 AM",3, 4,Thanks! I'll definitely keep your ideas in mind before I release out of Early Access!
2022-05-28 19:47:15.093121,Ocili_HeiHeiLaiKa,Yes - it's a Lemming Game-so what? Good!,"The principle of the game is quite old, but which game has not roots in existing titles? I would say: This game is GREAT for this price. Beautifully designed scenery and felxibility to position every moving object freely. This offers a huge degree of flexibility to solve a task and is a challenge at the same time! Sometimes it requires multiple tries to find the solution...good fun also for kids as a more advanced game - five stars! Well done ...my kids are looking for more levels :-) Please more of such games for kids but also other sorts of games like Tower Defense etc.","Apr 11, 2017 at 3:35 AM",5, 7,"Thanks! I'll be making more levels, don't worry!!  Thanks for playing!"
2022-05-28 19:47:15.177896,netshaman,A lemmings like game that is lovely,It is a nice looking lemmings style game with a bunch of originality : gnomelings are so cute and fun to play with :),"May 23, 2017 at 7:53 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 19:47:18.381458,avatizer,,"In this game you're an overlord of sorts to a race of gnomes who make up for their lack of survival instinct with comitment to walking in a straight line and following your creative directions. I've had a lot of fun circumventing the gnomes talent for death-by-incompetence through the use of rube goldbergian tools and my 'magic' touch. At this price, the game is a great deal and I can't wait to keep playing the increasingly complex levels.","Mar 17, 2017 at 10:00 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 19:47:18.397417,kgian76,,"A really nice game. Reminds me of lemmings, which is great. The game works great in VR, the graphics are really nice and it is very addictive. Also, the price is right. Grab it while you can!","Mar 20, 2017 at 6:19 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 19:47:18.415368,DanoKablamo,Entertaining and great music too!,This is a fun game that feels like a VR Lemmings homage.  Fun bonus Fairy Catching level too!,"Mar 16, 2017 at 5:29 AM",5, 8,
