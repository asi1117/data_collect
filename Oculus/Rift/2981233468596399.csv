2022-05-28 20:36:04.458434,Cullinarn,The Best Thing in VR as of 2022,"This is the best thing currently in VR. I've gone through over 150 of the VR apps/experiences, including almost all of the relaxation ones, from the DK1 to the present, and this takes the cake. There just isn't anything like it. If you need a fully immersive vacation from real life, this is it. G&G is not a game; at least not primarily. It is a living, breathing world that you become a part of. And the devs have used the years well in perfecting the simulation. Through a series of small compromises here and there, they've fixed a lot of what often sucks about VR. The result is stunning, in terms of both scope and depth: G&G almost NEVER breaks immersion. It begins with a visually stunning, fairly on-the-rails cinematic sequence that is deeply touching, and which can be revisited chapter by chapter. After that, it turns into something that is very close to a huge, open-world sim, which can be travelled by day or night. In addition to exploring the world, you can farm. You can walk amidst the trees on rope bridges. You can enter the homes and workshops. You can paddle down a river, under logs and toward a sacred grotto. Or, if you're feeling lazy, you can hitch a raft-ride with the goblin gondoliers. And so much more. It's like the game knows what I want before I do. Graphically speaking, the world is beautiful, and there is an immense amount of activity throughout. In terms of the audio, it's virtually indistinguishable from what you'd experience in nature. In terms of comparing the impact G&G had on me, I'd have to go all the way back to the first time I logged into an MMORPG in the 90s. G&G is the only game where it feels like the simulation is running whether I am in-world or not. Asgard's Wrath has been dethroned. There is simply nothing like this, and there may never be again.

I should note that I'm running G&G almost flawlessly on a 1080 ti, with the graphics set to ""Ultra"". It sounds like there were some early optimization issues, but they have been fixed.",Jan 12 at 12:01 PM,5, 5,

2022-05-28 20:36:04.489351,b-twice,Beautiful Game,"I tried out this dev's demo from about 4 years ago and now a full fledged world and game has emerged. Very beautiful and detailed world, the characters are too cute for me to bear! I love the way the game is unfolding and look forward to showing this to my friends so they can see what makes VR so special.","Jun 1, 2021 at 10:48 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:36:04.503314,Kristin525,A beautiful world!,"I'd been looking forward to this game for a long time and it didn't disappoint! Yes, the opening scenes are short, and yes, it would be nice to have more guided chapters. However, it's such a joy to explore the world. I love being able to shrink down to the size of a goblin. There are a few bugs - e.g., I keep falling out of one of the treehouses when I try to follow my friend up the stairs - but it's overall a wonderful experience. I have a RTX 2070 (a bit less than the recommended 2080) and I'm able to play on the highest resolution, though sometimes I see black for a short time when I turn. This goes away on lower resolution settings.","Apr 26, 2021 at 3:47 PM",5, 11,
