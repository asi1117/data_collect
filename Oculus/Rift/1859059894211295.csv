The backpack only has 4 slots, but there are so many items you can pick up, it can be overwhelming. there are also like 3-4 guns given within the first 10 mins of the game. for me personally, the difficulties are either 1 shotting zombies, or using entire mag to kill a zombie with a headshot. I was having an issue where some weapon magazines i've picked up dont show up on my belt. This game could be great!","Sep 1, 2020 at 1:42 AM",3, 18,
2022-05-28 15:42:03.056877,AustinRuby,"My issues, based on freeroam experience","Audio: experienced no audio, did a restart of my equiptment problem persisted.

Movement: when attempting to ""walk"" forward I'll either move like a snail or get shuffled of to an odd angle.

Melee combat: Extreamly stiff movment with weapons, very difficult to produce effective swings, I would like to see some punching or grappeling capabilities with ""bare handed"" combat.","Oct 12, 2020 at 11:27 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 15:42:03.071837,Zero3200,A great zombie experience.,"A great zombie experience. 

Bugs and stuff, mostly fixed though. I experienced a freeze crash occasionally in the outbreak scenario. It seems to be on the first time I boot it up, restarting seems to ""warm up the program so it works properly"".

Gun handling is ""realistic""( drop ammo if you reload early and proper reloading and cocking of the weapons.)

Zombies take a good beating before dying. They stumble from gunshots and melee attacks. Gore includes smashing and and desmemberment.

Nostalgic characters and zombie models from Contagion.

Oculus has issues with updating properly so I didnt have the new content for the longest time. I not have the latest version soI have yet to review the new stuff.
(The follow is just the old version content)

New content ""Biotec"" looks good so far ony got 10 minutes into it. They improved Movement speed and shotguns handling. Right on!

 A working tutorial

 two campaign style modes: 
Outbreak- A classic introduction to a zombie outbreak
Vacancy- Tells a story about your character and brother fighting for survival and helping others escape the outbreak. Has a little puzzle solving at the start hopefully you wont get stuck.

 Free Mode: Good for replaying and exploring only one unique level not from campaign so far.

Charlie: I never really got into this one, it plays like a survival horror where you play as a little girl trying to excape from a big mansion Not an action one, more about the horror and puzzles.

Shooting Range: Fun with guns lots of guns, and you can pump shotguns properly unlike that Zero Caliber game(might be fixed but this is not a review of that game).

A great zombie experience.","Jul 21, 2020 at 11:30 PM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 15:42:03.086796,zcom79,Buggy... good graphics though.,"So far I can't get past just after getting out from apartment in first episode, as game inevitably crashes and even though check point was reached once, no save/reload feature, which would have at least made it tolerable.  As is forced to replay same sequence, I can't force myself to watch same sequence for the third time, if crashes again, returning it.","Jun 22, 2020 at 8:22 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 15:42:03.101756,MajorJukes,WOW! Really smooth great graphics & fun!,"I saw that a lot of negative reviews are by jerks who played the game when it first came out and it had a lot of bugs but they all neglected to come back to the game after patches fixed the issues to see that it great 0% motion sickness, really clean and smooth with good graphics for VR! Truly impressed, I see some people who complain about the gun mechanics but I like them a lot! Shooting in real life isnt easy unless you have steady hands and can line up those sites really well just like this game so I appreciate that.

Suggestions:
Some things I saw that I didn't like were how the hands won't grab melee weapons properly sometimes (not a big issues but slightly annoying) and a concern I see myself and many others having is the parts were you do all this cool looting and get a large cache of weapons only to hit a type of checkpoint (without a save) where all your items, weapons, and ammo are gone but right in front of you is a stash of good weapons and ammo which makes up for it but people appreciate keeping what they work hard looting to get and it hurts players who don't go out of there way to find the extra special loot.

Also the 1st mission was AMAZING! The story! The dialogue! The action! The sequence of events leading up to the zombie outbreak was incredible and enjoyable! A couple small issues I had with the first mission was *SPOILER* (when I open my bedroom door the voice dialogue began before I could even see the maintance man and he was saying ""get back! get back!"" before the zombie even stood up which was bad timing and really threw off the great story/game vibe.)  *SPOILER* (also another annoyance I had was at the turret zombie waves part, you can't grab the turret with both hands like you're supposed to; so the game forces you to single handedly shoot a turret which looks silly and doesn't feel good.) 

*END OF SPOILERS*

All in all my overal first impression of the game is amazing! Combat = epic crossbow = FUN! please make DLC I'll pay top$ for it!","Mar 17, 2020 at 4:08 AM",5, 10,
