2022-05-28 19:33:32.481748,FastLawyer,Worst Tower Defense Game in VR,"This is the worst TD game I have ever played. I only paid .99 cents USD but I still feel ripped off. There is no real game here. You just put towers down and swat enemies away. Repeat this endlessly. Zombies tend to spawn near the tower so eventually you die. Plus I don't think the crab / tree works as intended and you're too close to the action by default (you need to reset your room position so you're further away). Even if this game were free, I wouldn't recommend it, that's how bad it is.",Oct 3 at 12:46 AM,1, 0,
2022-05-28 19:33:32.497705,twharrington,Good start,This game has a good idea but it needs lots of work,"Jun 8, 2019 at 2:38 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 19:33:32.512665,Fosya202,"I like tower defence games, but not this","It's not bad for a first game made, but unfortunately, playing this is so painfull. 
- Tutorial don't show such a thing, like Towers are diseappering after a few shots, that was a unpleasant surprise in middle of game.
- You need to shake your hands really often to interact with map, you got no hammers, no instruments, only this huge uncomfortable hands and torso. 
- design is uncomfortable, towers placed on high shelf, and you need to rise your hands really often because of ""melting"" towers. 

Conclusion: you can buy it for 99 cents may be, but I saw really better games, wich were free.","Apr 1, 2019 at 9:50 PM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 19:33:32.527625,Kuraokami,Totally broken,"It looks passably promising at first glance, but the development seems to have stopped about halfway to a minimum viable product. Honestly, I feel ripped off, despite having paid only 99 cents.","Mar 3, 2019 at 6:45 AM",1, 7,
2022-05-28 19:33:32.542585,WWWyzzerdd,The only reason I own this is because,it's free,"Aug 14, 2019 at 2:18 PM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 19:33:35.652316,Feyde,Lots of Repetition,"Once you've figured out the first few minutes of gameplay, nothing changes.  The general idea and graphics of the game are okay, but it's just a lot of rinse-and-repeat motions for each wave of bad guys and nothing changes.  Nothing to work towards or look forward to aside from more of the same.  Might keep the gradeschool kids busy for a while, but it's not for me thanks.","Nov 20, 2018 at 12:18 PM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 19:33:35.667276,MrProtagonist,worth 99 cents,"1 map, 3 towers, 4 mob types, 0 upgrades, no fastforward. 1 game mode: endless. which is flawlessly named, as your lost attention span is what ends the game. it has lots of update potential though, and was worth the dollar it cost.","Oct 6, 2018 at 12:57 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:33:35.682236,bimwhoop,Everything is up close,"I start the game and everything is really close.  I have reset view in Rift Home but it just puts everything close to your eyes.  There does not seem to be any setup screen in the game.

I fake putting myself closer to the sensors then sit back.  Manage to place tower in tutorial but cannot shake shell or bridge.  It says press on scroll but no indication what to actually press.  I even tried to press my nose.  Tried all the other button on my touch controllers.","Aug 8, 2018 at 4:28 AM",2, 6,

2022-05-28 19:33:35.713153,clerythecleric,Terrible...,"Since you want me to ask questions so bad... I'll just post them here. Feel free to answer them. Hopefully these will also help others and give them an idea of whats to come in this game... should they be dumb enough to actually pay for it (like i was)

Why do the towers not grab properly?
Why when i swipe the helicopter one way does it fly in the opposite direction?
Why does the entire room glitch and sway every couple of minutes?
Why is there only 3 towers?
Why do the towers not place properly on the map. having to hold them down so precisely still for 5 seconds?
Why are there no tower upgrades? Was it laziness?
Why are there only 2 map objectives?
Why do the map objectives not active properly when swiping?
Why are only 1 mob spawning?
Why did you just make it 'auto increment' mobs instead of putting in effort to create waves?
Why do zombies randomly spawn NEXT to the base?
Why do the models look like they were made by a child?
Why is there no way to speed up?
Have you ever played a real tower defense game before?
Did you spend ANY time making this game?
Did you really expect a better reaction from this BS game?
Why do you write yourself FAKE reviews on oculus?
Why do you use suttle passive agression when you get a bad review instead of focusing on the actual issue?
Why do you continue to defend a game you have obviously put 0 effort into it?
On the off chance i'm wrong, and u actually tried your hardest at this game... Why don't you just quit developing right now...?","Jun 6, 2018 at 4:17 AM",1, 24,Thank You for your opinion. Let me know if you have any questions. mailto games@vicovr.com

Now, like also other users, I have the problem that the screen is to near in the sight, so I can't use the controllers.

I installed this because it was on the sale. But the miniature world looks really cool in VR. Gameplay is the same as other TD games and gets repetitive after a while. The dark hands are a little goofy. However i realy like this game. Fun!  And you have to improve it.","Jun 15, 2018 at 2:28 PM",5, 1,
