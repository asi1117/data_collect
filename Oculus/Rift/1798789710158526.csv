I have not unlocked the ""Challenge Mode"" let as I have not beat the game.","Sep 5, 2020 at 10:55 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:44:45.664503,wrutter,pretty cool  [edited],"I dont know if it didnt load properly or if I was just having a bad hair day or what, but it works fine now and is pretty interesting so far.  Combination of hand/eye and logic skills.   The tossing motion doesnt react quite the way I'd expect, (I almost think I'd be more accurate with the real thing, have done Ultimate, disc golf, etc.) but once you start adjusting for that, it goes better.  Could see upgrading further if more time and experience makes the mechanics improve, we'll see. 

[edited]  menu selections light up but don't do anything?","Aug 19, 2019 at 3:11 AM",3, 1,"Hey wrutter,

You have to press a button to select a menu item. Hope this helps!"

2022-05-28 19:44:45.708385,Scott-Jon,An Indie Gem!,"Get your disks of Tron on!

Really nice Tron atmosphere and sounds, and a unique premise where you toss the disk to your other self with increasing complexity and challenges.

I'm amazed that this game is not better known, as it's really really fun and addictive! When indies don't have millions of dollars of advertising funds and a PR department, games like this sadly don't get the attention they deserve.","Mar 29, 2019 at 9:31 PM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 19:44:48.846108,TAH78,Very good game,"Very good game, nice graphics and a good physic of the disc. Recommended. Some situations are very challenging - very difficult. The game makes much fun. But on the very difficult challenges you have to play over and over again. That can be a bit frustrating. Maybe an idea for future updates - in some games its possible to skip a challenge, that would be nice in this game. Also - when you succesfully beat a stage it would be cool to be able to play it again, a kind of a level selection for already played stages on the menu screen.","Nov 11, 2018 at 1:32 AM",5, 2,"Thanks for the feedback! I've added your suggestions on the todo list.
At the moment, you can select the levels in the arcade menu after you completed the game once."
2022-05-28 19:44:48.862066,itschriscollins,Great gameplay,"Infinity Disk has a fairly simple premise of playing frisbee, except you have to throw the disk to yourself and teleport to catch it. The Disk has no gravity so it’s all about precision. It starts simple but quickly gets more difficult with enemies, moving barriers, and timed challenges, as well as special challenge modes once you’ve finished the 12 levels. It’s got good graphics, and will hopefully get more levels and a multiplayer mode in the future. Well worth the money.","Nov 12, 2018 at 3:34 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:44:48.877026,gilad.gross,Very fun game!,"Simple and fascinating.
The design is beautiful.
You throw yourself a frisbee !!!
After an hour of play it became quite challenging.
Highly recommend.","Nov 8, 2018 at 10:36 PM",5, 6,
