2022-05-28 19:42:30.469092,jmalmsten,No... Canon... Just... no...,"What was the point of this exercise? What was the reasoning? Ok, putting together a camera simulator might work. But the controls are downright horrendous, you can't view the resulting images in the app, you can't focus, shutter-speed has no effect on motion blur... Why even bother? And to top it all off... A multibillion empire makes a VR app. Using the Personal Edition of the 3D engine. Not the Pro. The personal. The one that is supposed to be used for home use and educating oneself of coding...","Nov 18, 2016 at 9:55 AM",1, 23,

Right now, this app has nothing to offer.","Jun 20, 2017 at 10:15 PM",1, 0,
