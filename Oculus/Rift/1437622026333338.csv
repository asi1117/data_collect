I bought this a while back and I have never been able to get it to run even once. I don't even know who to reach out to for support on this. Every time I try to launch the game it crashes right after the initial startup splash page before it ever gets into the game.","Oct 17, 2020 at 4:20 PM",1, 2,

Keep in mind this is a stand still 180 (athough close to 270 at times) mission based wave combat with boss fights at the end of each wave/ chapter. There is a very brief story about some real battle I think although it's just text and, again, very brief.  At the end of each battle, you teleport to a different node and battle again in that area. Sometimes with the same weapon, other times with a completely different weapon. You'll be using sword & board, dual swords, dual throwing axes, spear, bow & arrow (including adding fire to arrows to blow stuff up), ballista, etc. Action is quick & dirty. What I mean is that for the most part you can ignore all your training and just swing wildly about. Although, you do have to be accurate with the bow, most enemy arrows can be blocked or easily avoided. Also, enemy archers are usually not that good. Boss fights is where the game gets interesting. I was at the third boss and quit after trying 3 times and dying easily 3 times. I was soaked in sweat and that probably had more to do it honestly because I did want to continue otherwise. I do recommend this game, but on sale. I think $10 is perfect for the content available, but $30 seems kind of steep for what's here, even though it is fun.","Jul 29, 2018 at 3:35 AM",4, 9,"Thank you for your play and review.
