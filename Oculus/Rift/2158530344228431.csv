UPDATE 04/12/2019 : After many tries, I tried it again today and it works fine. Seems they fixed it. I raise my rate to 3 stars.","Dec 5, 2019 at 1:58 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:43:37.653770,LeeoSeven,Not optimised for Rift,"So the story & Artwork are obviously very nice but even when downloaded to a quality SSD, it plays extremely poorly. It's suposedly in 2160p but i dont thimk that this resolution works well on Rift? Something definitely isn't right, it's very blurry & stuttery. I presume it's been ported from Oculus Go? A real shame, could have been much better if properly optimised for Rift. The Devs should watch ""The Bond"" (FREE on the Oculus store) to see how it should be done.","Aug 30, 2019 at 11:45 PM",2, 0,"Hi Leo

Sorry for the inconvenience. Did you use Oculus go? Do you mind to send more info to support@veer.tv? We will refund you if we failed to solve the problem."
2022-05-28 19:43:37.668730,TimG,Mixed feelings,"I think I was expecting something more than just a hi-res video, albeit beautiful and enjoyable to watch.  It took a moment or two to figure out where the action was as I often found myself looking in the wrong direction and so often missed things (although I suppose you can just go back and see it again).  I bought this in the sale and so it only cost £1.49 therefore I am not going to complain too much.  It is what it is... a visually pleasing 'experience' in a video format.","Jun 6, 2019 at 7:09 AM",3, 3,"Hi there, thank you for your review.
