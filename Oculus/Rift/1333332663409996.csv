2022-05-28 19:29:07.051191,TechnoMermaid,Stunning Audio-Visual VR Wonderland,WOW!!! Flying around in these magical worlds listening to music is just about the best thing ever. This is truly a feast for the eyes and a complete joy to experience. I miss music festivals more than anything and having these environments to listen to music in is such a nice escape. I love the live painting feature and the ability to shoot fireworks out of my hands is so fun and mesmerizing. The game mode Spectra Dash is super fun too!!! Thank you for creating such a cool place in VR.,"Nov 10, 2020 at 12:56 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:29:07.066151,EndlessDreams,AUDIOVISUAL MAGIC,"In a year where all my favorite festivals and concerts are shuttered, I am so thankful to have found this wonderful program.  The visionaries at Groove Science Studios have created a truly incredible artistic oasis with Soundscape VR.  The images, video, and sounds of this mesmerizing experience speak for themselves, Soundscape contains the most beautiful virtual venues I have ever seen across any medium. 
Even better is that the artists behind this wonder have built this as a free musical paradise with no advertisements.  What a beautiful escape Soundscape VR is.  10/10","Aug 6, 2020 at 7:35 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:29:07.094076,FOREST_FAIRY,Not just the best music game,"The best VR game I've played outside of Half Life Alyx. Simple to learn but massive depth for those willing to take the time to explore. Getting high and relaxing inside is bliss, or just sharing some new music with your friends. My 3 favorite things:

1) The flying locomotion
2) Spectra dash (Better than beat saber)
3) The amount of music options - I usually just use streaming services and don't mess with the UI

If you have a weak PC you will probably need to turn down the graphics, things can get pretty crazy. The game doesn't hold your hand or limit you on what you can do like many other games, this is an ultimate sandbox where your destiny is truly your own.

The live mixed reality concerts are something else. Revolutionary for that feature alone, but is so much more than just that even if you prefer to just play around solo. The devs really thought of everything!

Absolutely incredible for anyone serious about their passion for music, 10/10!","Apr 10, 2020 at 3:03 PM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 19:29:07.109036,hulafam,Simply stunning,"A masterpiece of musical and visual arts. Runs great on my 1070, even though the scope and depth of the visual effects are unmatched by any VR title I've played since 2013. Huge amount of features, equally fun singleplayer or multiplayer!

The menu has disappeared, i cant figure out how to choose which animation i want. developers wtf... this application was so perfect before please please please go back... or make a menu system people can use whilst lost in music to chance between animations without distractions. i beg you to sort this out, i loved this app, now i reminisce  :frowning:","Aug 4, 2019 at 7:22 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 19:29:10.292522,Han69,A lot of potential but,"Nice Things you can do. The best of all Music Apps.

But the important is the Music. I can´t hear my own Music. I must upload the Music. mmh. Also I can´t hear Youtube music. 
Uploading is not possible from another hard disk. Only from the installing Disk. Ok i can life with.
 
Please make more like that.
There are no Rooms in multiplayer what was to see for me. There is no simple entry hall where we can see other people where we can arrange with.
Make a hall where we can hear Staff favorite music. We are alone... :(
I wants to see the App like a disco or event place where we can meet with other people. More then 8 People. 
In a Event can be hundreds or more People in the forest. 
Events must be to see in the hall with Time and Date. A door where we can move in. Nice will be Rooms where will be 70s, 80s, 90s and other good Music in a loop. I don´t how it can work legally.
Please make fast more and you will be in the front of all music apps.
Make more Avatars. They can look like in your Videos or take Oculus Avatars.
Make more Tables or Corners where we can meet with our Friends in the Disco or Event. Not to big.
More Flahes with the rhythm of the music
Reproduce more real Event places or famous discos or places.
Like Loveparade, Ibiza Discos, Mysteryland Festival Netherland, Full Moon Party Thailand and so on. Dozens of Important places.

The app will have much more potential","Mar 10, 2019 at 5:37 AM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 19:29:13.409186,novaspyder,Mind Blown,"Wow.  This is one of the most visually captivating experiences I have ever had in VR, the audio-reactive worlds in this game are simply a work of art.  This could easily be 20 dollars and be well worth it, the fact that it is free is absolutely incredible.  For a music lover like myself, being able to play my music from my hard drive, spotify, soundcloud, etc. makes this music app better than any other.  Put on your favorite songs, slip into Soundscape, and melt away.  Five stars.","Dec 9, 2018 at 5:08 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:29:13.424146,Wembley808,No Options?,"When you join it's a bit confusing as there is not many options. 
It appears that you can't select a Music file but must first load it... which removes the sense of emersion. Other apps allow you to at least select from your PC music to play, I can see this option.

The instructions state that you must first start the song from your device.. ok... by the time I have got into the app the song is already through the intro... did set the review to 2 stars but now 1

Update, launched a song, got into the app (the song still playing) and all I got was the menu.. ah","Oct 12, 2018 at 5:17 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 19:29:13.439106,neuro27,One of the Best Visualizers. In Progress,"There are four great visualizers on the store right now: Vision, GrooVR, Space Dream VR Demo, and SoundScape VR. Of these, this app offers the most interactivity. It also offers a tutorial to learn the controls. It is limited by not being able to select music within the app. There are two areas to explore. The first one, has the earth out in the distance. I was able to fly over to the Earth (took about 5 minutes) and go inside of it. Unfortunately, when you do this, the Earth disappears so you cannot look at it from the inside. There is a secret I was unable to figure out. Also, it looks like multiplayer might be in the works, which would be very cool!","Oct 2, 2018 at 2:08 AM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 19:29:16.617605,gjrocha,,"Soundscape VR is a great way to have fun and relax during your downtime. I used it to help introduce a few of my friends to VR and they really enjoyed it. You can listen to whatever music you want and fly around the level shooting crazy particle effects that can bounce around the environment and destroy floating cubes. Additionally, the ingame environment has a lot of lights and effects that can provide a good amount of variety to the level and its atmosphere. It's a still a little rough around the edges, and I hope they add more VR menu options, but that hasn't impacted my experience. I'm looking forward to later updates that bring further polish to the game. If you find yourself spending time just relaxing and listening to music, you should definitely give this game a try.","Jun 16, 2018 at 9:18 AM",5, 2,

I find something new everytime i play Soundscape. Whether it's the visualy stimulating environment, the fireworks and effects, the draw tool or even the ability to air drift, this game always has something to offer to my creative imagination everytime I play it.","Sep 25, 2018 at 9:33 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:29:16.648522,ronmoes80,,"I have tried the tutorial and i was impressed by the colours, I see potencial for this app but I uninstalled it during the tutorial. I just can't wrap my head around the fact that people actually like to teleport?! I have tried dozens of apps,games that offer free movement and that is the ONLY thing that works for me, people saying otherwise have either very fragile stomage for VR or they are very stupid and like to wast time on clunky way of moving themselfs. Also an 'experimental' browser?? come on developer. have your app be in windowed mode while using it , that would make searching for music and playing your own music alot easier.

Hope you do something with these points of critism because your app is showing potencial. It just needs some tweaking ;)","Apr 29, 2018 at 11:52 PM",2, 6,"Thanks for the feedback, I wanted to let you know we just released a new update today that features full flight for locomotion in addition to the teleportation!

2022-05-28 19:29:19.724295,quicksilver33s,Next level visuals,"Being very passionate about music, I have followed the release of this game closely.  I have been going to Music Festivals all over the world for a long time now and always thought VR would be a great fit for crazy visuals. I’ve used and love programs like Milkdrop and Electric sheep but Soundscape really takes the visuals to the next level.  It’s so amazing being able to add my own art to some of my favorite songs.
I use voice to control all my songs using a system through Google home. I have to imagine this would be the ideal setup since I can play the game with whatever song I want just by asking. Still you can control the music within the game if you want.  I’m running on only a GTX 970 and get better performance than I expected, there is a LOT going on with different visuals going on at a multitude of ranges from within your hands to the furthest reaches of space.
You really can’t go wrong with this. 
 The soundscape world is amazing, and I can’t wait to see multiplayer. It is clear that this kind of experience is going to be a focal point of VR in the future","Apr 23, 2018 at 10:59 AM",5, 5,
