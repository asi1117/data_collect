2022-05-28 19:43:32.614143,TAEKKRA,best 10 bucks I spend in a while!,"I must congratulate the developers for making this game! For me, the perfect shooter!!! I mostly use VR for creative pourposes and research, but some times I just need to blow of some steem, and this game is just perfect for that! sure, there are others like it... but none of them have the beautifull enviroments like this one! If I could, I would just take a rollacoaster ride through this awesome world... and than grab my guns and shoot some alien-droids (LOL) I guess, especially for non- or new-VR gamers this is a very cool starting game! Action, fun, beauty, immersion, fitness... it's all there! and the very long lifespan (in beginner mode) make it realy fun not to die right away, and actually have the chance to improve skills, before any frustration sets in...so again, congrats you guys, keep up the good work (and artistic style) !!!",Mar 26 at 7:31 PM,5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:43:32.629104,LeeoSeven,AN ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE GAME!!!,"I first bought this game on Steam in a sale but it didn’t run particularly well, but I loved it so much that I bought it for full price on the Oculus Store & it runs amazingly well. I own over 60 paid vr games & this is easily one of my top 5 favourites. IMHO on a par with Robo Recall in its own right. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous, the sound effects are very cool & the gameplay is so so satisfying! It’s extremely well optimised & it has great replay value. I love the unique art style, it’s absolutely stunning & looks every bit as good as the screenshots. If you like shooters, stop reading this & buy it, you definitely won’t be disappointed. Hats off to the devs for this highly polished game, it just goes to show how great VR can be with the right people making the games. If there’s ever a sequel, I’ll be buying it on day one. Just perfect.","Aug 30, 2019 at 7:01 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:43:32.645061,Bigelowed,Beautiful taste of what the devs can do,"Sure, it's a bit short, but the price is very decent for the length of play (and replay) this wave shooter is. It's mostly standing but there are a few parts where you ride some kind of hover bike too.

Generally just amazing looking, fairly well polished gameplay (one time a boss disappeared on level 4 but loading last checkpoint is easy to do, and pretty darn fun.

Did I mention it's beautiful?","Jan 31, 2019 at 3:28 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 19:43:32.662015,taquitobuddy,Nice artwork but nothing else,"Pros - Artwork is very nice, stylized yet lavish, the whole game looks like a nice new car finish.

Cons - Everything else.  This is extremely bare-bones for a game.  Played the first 2 (of 5 total) levels in 10 minutes.  There is no locomotion at all, and little of anything else.  For comparison, Blasters of the Universe is the same kind of game (stationary waveshooter) but with 20-30x the content.

Sadly despite the nice artwork, this feels like the free demo you get to advertise a real game.  Can't recommend.  1 star for a game, 2 stars if you are just wanting to admire the art.","Jan 16, 2019 at 2:28 PM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 19:43:32.676975,dnamvoh,,"Very different waveshooter and surprisingly active. The artstyle, music and large environments gives this game a unique feel. The combat is intense! I found that, flayling my arms around to remove the stuff in my face and then shooting at the biggest threat, to be an effective ""tactic"". Its worth going through the shooty bits to see what the devs cooked up.","Jan 13, 2019 at 5:02 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 19:43:35.781722,ParadiseDecay,1st Impressions Video with Commentary!,"*NEW VIDEO:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXLDkUwGDJM (Please Note: links might not work from Oculus so please search YouTube for 'Paradise Decay VR Singularity 5')

*PLEASE NOTE: I have now given this game 4 stars, it was originally 3. The developers have listened to my original suggestions, added some much need game improvements and an essential EASY mode for new players.
I hope they continue to listen to feedback and make this as good as it has the potential to be!

My Quick Thoughts: (From my Orignal 1st Impressions Video)
This is probably one of the nicest VR wave based shooters I have seen since Robo Recall. It's well polished, looks amazing and has a really nice combat feel.
It's well worth picking up for the price and the developers are constantly updating the game with feedback from players on their discord channel.
I feel like the game could do with more enemies!

2022-05-28 19:43:35.796682,FA1CO,One of the best takes on wave shooter,"I loved the art style very unique and really added to the experience,  the mechanics, were okay have a few minor changes I would make but all and all a great game, the price is right and I am enjoying the hell out of this so far!!1","Jan 11, 2019 at 5:42 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 19:43:35.811642,Lucyda,Great look and feel,"I totally fell in love with the white-golden or black-golden colors and the baroque-Vicorianish style of the weapons and machines. Also loved the soundtrack.

But despite that it's just shooting, reloading and kickin some stuff around. This stressed me out and I didn't went through. If Robo Recall looked this way, I'd played it the next ten years :D","Jan 21, 2019 at 5:01 AM",3, 3,
