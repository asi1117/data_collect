2022-05-28 13:43:49.526707,henrystickman08,this game is sooooo hard,i liked nothing about this and hated that the only why to get rid of the bad robots is to throw a knif at them and if you dont have a good throwing arm you will die a lot and to pull up your invatory you will have to put away your portal gun [the thing you youse to move] pull out a knife than throw it so if your not pepared you die and theres a level that gives you 0 knifes and has a bunch a robots and if you hit a robot any ware but the head they will take 2 knifes and that part is nere the start of the game the exit is hard to get to and its locked and the note telling you how to unlock it makes no sense. i think its caled budget cuts becuse they cut the budget for the game in to and took only one part,"Jun 10, 2021 at 3:07 AM",1, 0,

2022-05-28 13:43:49.572585,Danonychus,Finally had a great time,"I played the demo of this game back in the early days of VR and had been looking forward to it for a long time, but after it's release I never really got into it for some reason.  Probably the buggy gameplay, long load times, and issues with locomotion.  Since their recent overhaul update, I revisited it and wound up having a blast.  Sure, the throwing can be a little wonky, but I stuck with it and managed to be effective enough to complete a playthrough.  It wasn't until the final stage that I realized that there was a ""mutator"" that you could turn on to allow for free movement in addition to the translocator gun.  Plenty of options for comfort baked into that too.  I wound up going with ""jog"" speed and snap turning, which peeled off a solid layer of tedium from the gameplay.  Put in about 6 hours, only crashed once, and enjoyed most of the experience except the end game, which was a bit overwhelming until I figured out how best to proceed.   Seems there are some additional alternate challenges to take on in the arcade mode, and turning on some of the more cheat related mutators adds some extra fun to another run at the stages.  It was overall a fun experience with good replay value that left me quite satisfied in the end.","May 17, 2020 at 3:44 PM",4, 31,
2022-05-28 13:43:49.587544,dopingVR,game works again,"Update: Entitlement check has been fixed.
I must say many of the issues that have bothered me to a degree that made this game not enjoyable have been adressed in some way. The once borderline loading times are now more reasonable. Knives don't fall out of your hand when teleporting. At launch and many months after things were still messy. When I played for 45min just now, I only encountered a few non-critical issues/bugs. It is fully playable now.

However I am still not fully satisfied with the knife throwing mechanic. At least now it works for close range throws, that used to be an impossibility. But throwing them further than an arm length still feels inaccurate and random. The physics work better in other games ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

My biggest issues with this game is the ""hidden"" requirement for a generous play area. This is mentioned nowhere. I only have very little space and the game often forces me to move in my room to reach for things like vents. The portal gun can often only move me so close to the spot and real movement is required. I guess I'm smooth loco spoilt, but room movement is really tricky for me.

The menu translations feel like they are the result of google translate. I'd prefer solid english menu over my native language with weird wording.

In the end I must say performance has very much improved. I have not noticed any framedrops and got solid 90 during the entire session. The Performance patch actually delivers!
e: just noticed the long list of additional improvements... Aim assist... must... try.. OK you'll get an extra star!","Apr 28, 2020 at 11:59 PM",4, 17,

2022-05-28 13:43:55.931975,Zyl0,One step forward two steps back,"For every bright point in the game there is a point of needless frustration. The games bigest offenders are bad level design and poor controls. Though the later may just be an oculus thing as videos of people using the vive seem to be having a much better time of it. For me at least, opening drawers, getting things out of drawers, and turning screws were a night mare to get the game to register. The levels are hard to navigate and keep your bearings in, the worst offender being the final level, which also slaps the worst bit of backtracking the game has to offer right in your face before you see credits. Which left me leaving the game with only negative feelings despite the fun I had up to that point.

2022-05-28 13:44:02.198284,MegaBaconSticks,Somewhat Irritating and unpleasing.,"Don't get me wrong, I wanted to get this game badly from my experience from the Early Demo, advirtising, and non-spoiler video reviews, but after beating this game, I felt annoyed at the game's direction and the core of the gameplay. I feel like a fool for not buying any other game on my Wish List than this.
The beginning of the game was catching my attention, and I really enjoyed the mechanics. But after a while, I started getting dizzy moving my head everywhere and ducking around, to the point where it feels worse than playing Robo Recall. Regardless if you have the Rift S or 3 Sensor Setup, don't ever play this game on 360-Degree Room Tracking as the horrifying invention called the CORD will kink up your headset's wires and make it feel heavy and unplayable without accidentally damaging or losing that feel of being immersed.
Going back to the mechanics, it started getting bland really easily. ""Get X Keycard, open Y Door, Collect Z Item."" This game made me feel like an idiot, because I didn't know what to do or where to go even when you ask help from your pointless buddy agent, Winta.  I wanted this game to make me feel stealthy and sleek taking down gaurds and avoiding that wretched boss (Spoilers, name rhymes with ""Shmadam,"") but I only felt like I was being carried by game guides and forums on other people stuck on the last 3 or 4 parts of the game. This game is also very stressful when you can't use your non-dominant hand to fire a teleporting gun. Can't shoot up to the ceiling openings in time? Too bad, we'll just have those guards or Shmadam kill your for a dozen of times until you admit that you're dumb and want a solution to beat this short game to only find out that you're clumsy at playing this intense game.
I wish there was a good enough replayablity in this game, but I don't think the Arcade mode or 3 Different Difficulties seem promising for me to give this game another chance.

In Conclusion: If you have spare money, buy this game.","Jun 15, 2019 at 10:46 PM",3, 16,

I decided to play it again on hard, and it seemed just as easy.

2022-05-28 13:44:11.680191,penguin012,Stealth perfection,"First of all, let me just get this out of the way: I love stealth games. Budget cuts has provided the first good stelath experience in VR. The translocator (innovative new locomotion system) alone makes it worthwhile to play. Essentially, you need to escape robots that want to report you to ""HR"" at your workplace. You can sneak around, or go full psycho and murder everyone, or a combination. Combat is cool, but overhand throwing is basically unusable. Underhand is a much better option. ***EDIT: There was just a massive update that fixes nearly all of the major physics isuues. Overhand and underhand throwing now feel FANTASTIC and make the game even better.***
Stealthing is where the game shines, however. You'll be ducking, crawling, and telporting all over to avoid the gaze of the terrifying guard robots. The amount of tension when you never know when a robot can turn around and spot you is so exhilating in VR. 
Finally, the game world has SO much detail. The friendly and hostile robots all have lots of funny voice lines, and the office is littered with visual humour and objects that you can pick up and interact with. Plates have a frisbee mechanic that's so fun I'm actually doing a plate-only playthrough to kill guards.

You'll be getting at 4-6 hour story mode and really nothing else, but there's quite a bit of replay value. Is it worth it? Up to you.","Oct 23, 2018 at 10:08 AM",5, 36,

2022-05-28 13:44:21.131720,latearrival,If Portal and Thief had a child...,"TL;DR A fun sneak-around-and-kill-stuff game. Playing it in room-scale has already had me lying on my (real) floor and crouching under (virtual) desks. But design flaws detract from the overall experience.

At the time of this review it's lacking a bit of polish, e.g. long loading times with a plain black screen, some objects  make no sound when you drop them, a few graphical glitches here and there, screws that require dozens of turns of a screwdriver to undo, and a scary boss that can't kill you. But I expect these will be fixed sooner rather than later (especially now the devs seem to have fixed the poor throwing mechanic that plagued the Oculus Rift version).

What stops this being a 5/5 game for me is:

1. Killing robots with teleport & stab, or lure & stab, is too easy.  Killing them by throwing knives/scissors is too hard.  Throwing would make for a more suspenseful game but it's just too tempting to stab.

2. The level design gives you lots of different ways of achieving your goal. But it also means I found myself lost and going round and round in circles sometimes. And getting lost once all the bad bots have been killed results in long periods of tedium while you wander around trying to find out how to complete the level.

3. Most drawers and cupboards can be opened. 99.99% of the time they contain nothing useful. Sometimes, while trying to find a knife/screwdriver/keycard the game felt like a drawer-opening simulator.

4. Opinion varies on this, but I didn't like the final level. The pace/style of the game changes significantly from the earlier levels.

Overall, I felt like a lot of love went into this game but it falls short of its potential. I've got big hopes for Budget Cuts 2.

(PS Anyone who says this game is polished hasn't played it all the way through. It's very buggy).","Jul 3, 2018 at 2:15 PM",3, 28,

The game is fairly short(i completed it in about 3 hours), but if you are like me you will want to do a bunch of playthroughs(no kills, all collectables, hardest difficulty, without getting seen...etc) this game reminds me of playing old Thief games back in the day(i know its very different, but the same type of feeling). 

The game has a really colorful atmosphere and feel to it, the whole game is upbeat and chipper, and has a very unique humor about things. Just overall a great VR game, worth getting for sure.","Aug 5, 2018 at 9:22 AM",4, 15,

It's buggy, throwing things doesn't work, the teleport system sucks and the game just gets so boring to the point where it's annoying.

I love the story, I love the world they've created...but when your only defense against the bad guys is a well-placed knife throw, and the knife just stops mid-air and falls at your feet as you get shot, it's really hard to not feel like you're just wasting your time.

2022-05-28 13:44:33.770806,Virtuixx,Lower your expectatioons,"As soon as this game was released, I immiediatly bought it without hesitation. I was really excited, and had been axiously awaiting the release for ages. Having played through the majority of the game, I can say that it defiently didn't live up to my expectations, however.

On my first two boots ups, the game crashed my computer, although aside from that the game has been running smoothly. Hopefully with the latest patch the aforementioned bug will be fixed.

The gameplay is good - althought does get quite repetative. Aside from the introduction of the throwing knives later on, the gameplay remains mostly the same, only increasing in difficulty as the game progresses. During my playthough, there were a few sticking points where I had to look up walkthoughs onliine - which I found to detract from the experience. For example, at the point in the game where you need to find the level 5 keycard, the only way to proceed is to find and teleport through a tiny vent hidden behind a ladder. 

The game also lacks overall polish. The loading screen consists of a pitch black ""Have I crashed?"" screen, and the world feels quite empty and lacking (pens you can't interact with, hundreds of completely empty draws and cupboards). It would be nice to incorperate some more Job Simulator-esqe gameplay elements to give the game a reason to replay or to search and look for exciting objects or easter eggs.

Overall, I would definetly recommend giving this game a try. I definetly enjoyed it, although it certainly doesn't live up to the high expectations and hype set up by the demo and community.  It also doesn't reach anywhere near the advertised ""8 hour"" gameplay, with even what I would consider a slow playthough only lasting about 4-5 hours.","Jun 19, 2018 at 3:04 AM",4, 7,
