I thought it was going to be a comic book style of a story, but thank God that it's actually animated, not completely animated, but it has animation.  The voice acting, at least in English was fantastic.  It had like one or two jump scares, nothing crazy, but done well.  What surprised me the most was the story !  I thought the story was going to be predictable, but it surprised me.   The only bad thing I can think about is that, this is probably a one time thing, I highly doubt you'll watch it over several times, still, it's only $3.  Even though I'm not really into horror, I still liked it.","Mar 13, 2020 at 2:07 PM",4, 10,
