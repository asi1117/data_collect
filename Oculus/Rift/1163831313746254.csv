2022-05-28 15:21:20.706718,fayewray71,Almost perfect,"Amazing game, except it is hard to find people to play - I wish the developers would set up events","Dec 5, 2020 at 11:21 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 15:21:20.721678,Burgeration,Ridiculously fun,"Recomended by a friend - our daughters meet up to play together on this game during lockdown and it is straight up the highlight of her day. Brilliant games, quality production, good learning curve and hilarious sabotage mechanics - so many mor epeople need to buy this game!!","Apr 12, 2020 at 8:21 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:21:20.735641,HarbingerThrace,How Mario Party should be!,"Lots of fun to do minigames like this in VR.  The puzzles are funny, creative and fun.  Some even give you a hell of a workout.  The physics work really well too.  My boyfriend and I play on our two headsets (we have two computers).  Glad we got it =)","Dec 21, 2019 at 3:25 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:21:20.750601,wigwam,Should be 5 stars but...,"This game manages to be silly and challenging at time the same time. Since there never seems to be other players online my son, nephews, and I came up with our own local multiplayer version. Sharing the headset isn't that big of deal since you can watch each others turn on the PC monitor (we do each player gets 3 turns in a row so we're not constantly passing the headset around) but not being able to play the full game in ""solo"" mode is annoying. I don't know why there hasn't been an option added to have a local multiplayer but if thar ever happens I would happily give 5 stars.","Nov 26, 2019 at 12:00 PM",3, 8,
2022-05-28 15:21:23.890204,Ranjen,No People,I have been waitinng for a week and can't get into a game. There is no one playing this game. I have only been able to play not even a full game because everyone left.,"Sep 30, 2019 at 4:30 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 15:21:23.906162,EditCrazy,Fun Party Style Minigames,"Update: Thanks for the Dev response, I have found the box under the table and it works great. It also allows for seated play, which is nice.

Old Review: This is a great game concept, and I would love to play it with my daughter and her friends, however the lack of a height adjustment makes that impossible.  I've had this game for over year now and that simple omission has gotten of the way of playing nearly every time. Devs, don't miss out on the younger market here (especially if you plan on bringing this to the Quest).","Feb 19, 2019 at 9:01 AM",5, 8,"UPdate: Glad you found it and thanks for adjusting your review, enjoy! 1st Update: Hey there - fear not, you *can* play with your daughter! In September 2017 we added the Minor Feature UPdate, which added a virtual height boost when you pull the box out from underneath the main game table and stand in place on top of it ^_^"
2022-05-28 15:21:23.921121,MervinRae,Great Fun.,"Great fun to play. Very funny and well executed mini-games (16) - not too easy, with good replay value. Very entertaining with friends (taking turns locally). Very funny design. It feels like being in a japanase game show! Professional production value. This is really a gem of a game!","Feb 12, 2019 at 5:01 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 15:21:27.124553,o.O.Womb.Raider,GARBAGE,"Nobody plays this.

Like every Rift game I buy, this is dead. Rift sucks, no online community. 

Nice job segregating the online community into the proprietary ""Rift"" community.

Wasting time and money trying to search for one other person in the whole world to play this, but day after day I am loading up and nothing comes.

Rift is a stupid gimmick.","Apr 13, 2018 at 11:17 PM",1, 4,"Our game uses cloud-based servers so there is cross-platform play between Oculus Store and Steam users, the hardware is irrelevant. There are many reddit threads and forum posts with Loco Dojo players looking for games to join in with."
2022-05-28 15:21:27.139513,Ragee,Amazing game but is missing hot seat,"Bought the game as it seemed perfect for a VR party evening. The mini games are absolutly amazing. However, there is no local multiplayer so you will need to keep score on paper. This is by far my most played VR game and I hope there will one day be a sequel.","Oct 9, 2019 at 5:15 AM",5, 18,

2022-05-28 15:21:30.259169,TumbleWeeds,Beat Bats with Sausage Nunchucks,I play a lot of games and never leave reviews for them no matter how good or bad they are but this game....THIS GAME HERE...IS AN AWESOME GAME!  There are 16 different mini games that are all a blast to play and easy to learn but hard to master. Solo play is a fun.  One of the mini games gives you sausage nunchucks to beat off flying bats with. i mean what else could you really ask for,"Dec 7, 2017 at 9:09 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 15:21:30.274129,susan.mcgee.9041,Love this game!,"This is one of my favorite games!  Lots of mini-games to play - by yourself or with friends.  I haven't quite figured out how to win some of them, but hopefully with time...  I wish there were more VR games like this one that I go back to time and again.","Jan 8, 2018 at 7:07 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:21:30.288092,Bane1032,Great looking game.,"Graphics look very sharp for this gen of VR games. It has something like 16 minigames which are fun. some minigames are almost impossible, but always humorous. Still need to try the multiplayer. And I rate games that include multiplayer usually higher. Might get boring arfter awhile though.","Aug 12, 2017 at 11:56 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 15:21:30.304049,CharThundercock,Fun Fun fun.,"I am really suprised. Sometimes there is a game which catches you by suprise. This is one of those, its a great party game. Even with a few people and one Rift you can have great fun.","Aug 3, 2017 at 10:53 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 15:21:30.319009,Luna-NY,"Great game, but be ready to play alone","First thing first, sadly its really hard to find online games and creating games leads to a lot of time twiddling your thumbs.  But the game is great, would be amazing if a future update had the ability to do a local game for just high scores, but I understand its really meant for 4 players online.  Hopefully the community continues to grow, cuz this game is really fun.","Apr 30, 2017 at 11:28 PM",5, 4,"Hey Luna, have you tried the Solo Challenge mode?"

Wow..... even in single player I was surprised at the amount of depth this game offers. I don't think I've laughed so much in a VR game and I can imagine this would be a blast with friends.","May 13, 2017 at 1:50 AM",5, 7,
