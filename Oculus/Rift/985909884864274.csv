These brainiacs thought it would be way more lucrative  (read ""profitable"") to only tell you that you need a joystick or gamepad after you bought their game

Yes devs I know it is mentioned in the specs, legally you are in the clear, ain't that great?
My pov is about common curtessy, the fact that you did think of mentionning it AFTER the sale is proof that you are aware that possible issues may arise

When I am about to buy a 360 game I do get a warning that I will need a min of 3 sensors, not 2
You could easily have done something like that

Oh, also, only telling buyers after they run the game 1st time, that not all sticks/pads work with the game, but leaving it up to them to sort out which are supported is NOT cool

1 star for not giving a ....","Aug 28, 2018 at 2:03 PM",1, 16,"The description clearly says ""Starfighter Arduxim requires a gamepad, joystick or HOTAS"". There's no option I have as a developer to put up a warning dialog before purchase, that would need to be implemented by Oculus.

There's also a demo you could have tried first."

It's very much a hobbyist-made sort of game - but I love that about it - I'm a big fan of the voice acting and the gorgeous retro character graphics that show up when you're being spoken to by someone. I liked it a lot.","Feb 5, 2018 at 10:08 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 17:45:02.786339,rchrdcrg,Awesome value!,"I remember helping the dev out on reddit with the Gear VR edition. I'm SO thrilled to see this on the Rift, and it's definitely worth the price if you want a simple but effective space shooter.","Dec 15, 2017 at 3:31 AM",5, 3,

Also, the campaign is not the longest, but for the price, it is well worth it.","Aug 7, 2017 at 12:33 AM",5, 2,

It could be the start of something decent, but it needs a lot of improvement.","Nov 28, 2016 at 4:18 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 17:45:05.942896,bonarhya,excellent value,This is actually a really good game for the money.  Well worth it.  You can even try it out with the demo version for free before buying this full version.  wish all games offered free demo versions first.,"Dec 14, 2016 at 8:12 AM",4, 5,
