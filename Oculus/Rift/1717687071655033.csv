2022-05-28 18:22:21.560419,HarbingerThrace,Well told true life story,I love how it gives you 2 different perspectives.  Both are so well told.  Hope more films are made in VR as it is such a unique and immersive way of seeing a different world.  Great job BBC and devs!!!!,"Feb 9, 2020 at 4:23 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:22:21.576376,Lanzaboy,Great short with VR issues,"With two great names, BBC and Aardman I would expect it to be good. The story telling is very good. The animation is clever as I'm sure its inteded to run on as many VR platforms as possible. So for a low poly production it works well. 
The issues can and should be sorted. The sitting and standing option is confusing as it does suggests 2 viewing modes of the same thing. It is not. It is the story told from two different prospectives - which is at the core of the whole production.  Also the fact that the visual quality can be improved should be more obvious than sitting behind 'settings'.
The most serious technical issue is in the 'standing story' the software doesn't seem to understand the scale of the VR environment and you can't reach the interactive objects. In order to move the story on you have to interact.  Hence the need to reset the view outside the experience and even then its not perfect.","Mar 11, 2019 at 6:43 PM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 18:22:21.620259,Nathie,The future of storytelling in VR,"So yeah I gotta say. What an emotional but very powerful experience. Being able to step into the role of these twin sisters is very inspiring. You can experience things from both sides. The happy, the tough and the sad moments. With VR you can tell stories in such a next level way and in this case make people more aware of what a brain injury can do to someone.  I just love how they connected these two stories together with different perspectives in the way you were watching it but also dialogue wise.  Its a must try, a must watch, an adventure, a special connection.","Oct 20, 2018 at 5:07 AM",4, 9,
2022-05-28 18:22:24.713984,Zathereth,Great,Lovely TRUE story. It is emotional and the facial animations are great. The abstract design is great and doesn't need a lot of power to run. Maybe one of these days there will be a telltale style game for VR,"Dec 15, 2018 at 3:17 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 18:22:24.728945,itschriscollins,Storytelling in VR is very good,"This is a great example of good storytelling in VR, something the platform will really excel in. You simply can't get an experience like this from a book or movie, and the BBC are one of several companies putting out great content in this arena.

The story is very interesting to experience, especially seeing it from the viewpoint of both girls. You really do feel some of what they were feeling, and it's quite emotional.

There are a few graphical glitches, and if you have an issue like I did where you had to recenter I found the experience reset, so it has to be done in a single sitting and make sure you're comfortable. I also found in one story there were some rendering issues (from Anna's point of view in the park) which was a shame.","Nov 12, 2018 at 7:10 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:22:24.747894,Zimtok5,Thoughtful Biopic with a Twist,This split-session BBC tour through a real life story puts you in the shoes of a victim's story that you won't easily forget.  It's well presented and a worthwhile experience for those who like other BBC VR shorts.,"Oct 19, 2018 at 7:11 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 18:22:24.771830,firkinfedup,Interesting,"It's quite an interesting story about a girl who has suffered a head injury, from 2 different perspectives.  It's interesting enough, but when you consider that it was Aardman that created this, you know the studio that done Wallace & Grommit, it should be of a much higher standard, so I can't give it 5 for that reason.  VR is still in its infancy and we really need ""balls-out"" quality productions, not bits that are thrown together in a few days just for the sake of it.","Nov 3, 2018 at 8:50 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:22:24.786790,Deeperbeige,Fabulous VR storytelling,Heartfelt and emotional! A subject matter rather too close to home for me too. One note: I almost missed 50% of this because I thought there was two modes for the same story. Turns out seated/standing from the menu is actually the stories from each twin's perspective. Go through it in both modes to get the full experience.,"Oct 25, 2018 at 9:47 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:22:27.875529,Red_Prez16,Wow just wow! I don't know what to say!,This is a amazing one. It's based on a true story and where the script is written from their memories. This VR experience is excellent! It's puts you in Anna's perspective after she becomes a victim. I would recommend this one hundred precent. This is truly amazing. It'll make you think about more people like her. BBC you did a excellent job! Keep it up with more stuff like this!,"Oct 19, 2018 at 1:48 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 18:22:27.890489,Satconcook,Pulled the heart string,"I don't even know who these girls are but I was about to cry for them. Having had close family in a coma it really touched home. There are bits of the story that I wish I knew a little more about and the two versions of the story don't necassarily reflect being in the opposite position, but it is a great way to tell the story.","Oct 27, 2018 at 9:44 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:22:27.905450,KikiTay,Inconclusive?,Interesting way of story-telling but I was expecting a story. Instead it only focused on feelings. Quite disappointed not knowing what happened where who and how. It kept me hanging wanting to find out more but there weren't any more. I like the story-telling aspects of it and being able to see the point of view from different sides. But I really hope there was more.,"Oct 25, 2018 at 7:56 PM",4, 0,

Not only was it really educational, but also beautiful, and very very technically sound, no hitches of even the slightest amount.
Strongly reccomended, why is this not a standard experience that people show off the Rift with?","Oct 26, 2018 at 3:47 PM",5, 0,
