2022-05-28 15:33:55.451048,supergroulx,Love it.   So much fun.,All ages love this game.   Awesome that it has height adjustment controls for my little kids.   Why don't more games on Oculus have the basic essentials of height adjustments???   Like going to Chuck E Cheese for free.

2022-05-28 15:33:55.493933,Nikolofton,It was okay,"This game is pretty fun... for a while. this game was so exciting when i started but after you play every game multiple times it gets boring, You might be thinking isnt there alot of games? But the truth is it may look that way but when you play it you may be disapointed. It was fun despite its flaws, but 10$ for about 3-7 hours of gameplay i dont think its worth it.","Sep 3, 2019 at 1:15 PM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 15:33:58.628549,AshleyCarey,,This is my dream game. I never get bored and I love working to beat my friends scores. It's also a bit of a workout which is awesome. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who loves arcades and wishes they could play all the games for free for infinity.,"Jul 25, 2019 at 8:41 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 15:33:58.642512,riotzack,Pierhead Arcade Review,"This game is so fun when you first go on to it and continues when you play each machine but i recommend to play it with friends or on the multiplayer mode since it can be quite boring playing by yourself as you can buy items with tickets and you can compete in rc or tank races and you can go head to head and try and get a higher store than them.The price for the game is right and would be more worth it and a better game if they added more machines and possibly created a mod for users to make their own machines so the community can become a more exiting place and people would play the game more and it might attract more people to play the game.But the reason i put 4 stars is that there are some gameplay issuses,after youve played the game for some time in a sitting it can close the session and glitch out for everyone in it.but alltoghter i think the game is very good and fun to play but can be made so much better and i definatly recommend you do buy this .","Apr 22, 2019 at 1:58 AM",4, 9,

2022-05-28 15:33:58.672432,Suspector,Awesome game!,"Very fun place to just hang out and play fun games. Physics was nice on most games but not the whacker, it had no impact sound and an off angle when you hold the club. It would be awesome if you could use the trophys in your oculus home instead of the shelf in game....","Dec 21, 2018 at 8:18 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:33:58.687392,pabe05,One of the Best,A game I go back to again and again.  Graphics have never given me any issue and look great.  Games are fun and you can win prizes that can be used in the arcade such as a radio controlled car and drone.   Really well done and you can see the time and effort that went into this.,"Dec 29, 2018 at 9:43 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 15:34:01.808045,taquitobuddy,Fun for smaller kids maybe,"While this has lots of mini games, none of them are particularly fun.  I kinda enjoyed the reaction-time-hit-the-lights one, but that's about it.  Might be ok for smaller kids as it is simple to play and fairly polished.","Jan 2, 2019 at 6:42 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 15:34:01.822007,Fliex,Worth the 10$!,"Verry fun to waste time on!
but i sometimes hear a stacker sound or something and that made me think it could be added :)","Oct 4, 2018 at 8:35 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:34:01.836967,NanoDood,Glitchy but not bad,"Textures sometimes dont work and the controls are a little wierd. Most of the time there is some weired stretching at the bottom of the screens that distorts everything, doesnt seem to go away. For 5 dollars I am kind of thinking about whether it was worth it or not but its fun so id say it is. But I wouldnt have bought it for 10. If they fixed all the weird controls, texture issues, screen distortion, and user interface it would be a great game! Just not solid enough of an experience to rate more than 2 stars because of all the issues.","May 10, 2018 at 12:12 PM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 15:34:01.851927,MiniWheats84,The toys don't break when you get them!,Classic arcade fun! The claw machine is as infuriating as ever........ however it's worth the price for those machines alone!,"May 10, 2018 at 9:38 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:34:01.866887,nightcat.mau,Great Arcade!,"UPDATE: I like the Halloween update, the grinning jack o' lanterns are a nice touch.
I honestly got this game for the prize grabber, and was really pleased to find four of the machines, two with a teddy bear and other things, and two with a tiger/jungle theme. These are rigged and you will yell in frustration as the claw drops your prizes that you know you had. Having only two controls certainly adds to the challenge.  
The ball drop was my second favorite, and the games are pretty generous with tickets no matter how bad you are at them.  Then there is a seating area and soda machines, plus the prize corner. 
I liked that it gets you moving, unlike older PC games where we just sat and mashed buttons. For me it was a steal as those tiny claw machines for your home start at twenty five dollars and playing real ones can easily rack up what the game costs.","Oct 26, 2018 at 1:28 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 15:34:04.989535,Bel-garath,Performance Issues are killing the exper,"I agree with the last recent reviewer. The performance issues are killing this experience and unlike over a year ago, I can no longer recommend it until it is fixed. The video jumps around, almost like a connection issue. It is not happening on other games. This includes turning all of the settings to their lowest and disconnecting any extension cables I have. I shouldn't have to turn the settings down at all since I have a Nvidia 1080ti. I'll update my review if and when they respond or if they do a fix. I just want to warn people that when two recent posts say the same thing, there may be a problem if you purchase it.","Dec 18, 2017 at 3:37 PM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 15:34:05.005493,d_wats,,"I experience major performance issues, even with super sampling turned all the way down and the graphics set to low. Joining or inviting friends in multiplayer threw an exception every time. When we did play together, via the quick join option, other players were rendered at sub 10fps and we could not see each other's prizes from the ticket vendor. 

On the plus side, in single player some of the games seemed to be enjoyable.","Dec 15, 2017 at 1:35 PM",2, 1,

2022-05-28 15:34:08.133128,mrmojoman0,not much to it,"some standard games, although weird physics makes it hard to  throw anything with any momentum without hurting your arm. 
more than that though, i can't count how many times my progress was reset because one of my hands got too close to the coin slot, which is usually placed right next to whatever it is you are grabbing things from. 

also, the worst shooting range i've ever experienced. 

i wasn't expecting much, but am still disappointed.","Sep 3, 2017 at 2:10 PM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 15:34:08.150082,Twan103,"Wasn't expecting much, was blown away.",For just $10 bucks you get HOURS upon hours of family fun. There's a huge variety of fun games to choose from. Every time you unlock a prize with your tickets it's very satisfying. I genuinely hope more people buy this app. This would get the developer to keep working on it and adding new gamemodes. Im all for that.,"Aug 22, 2017 at 8:52 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:34:08.165043,cybernettr,Strangely unintuitive interface,"You'd think it would be obvious how to play all these games you've played in real life...but it isn't. Teleporting uses 2 different buttons, one for moving and another for changing direction, instead of a single thumbstick to do both, like in Robo Recall and other games. In bowling, the ball isn't returned to you (plus, the physics are awful...with a huge powerful arm movement, the ball barely budges). The ""crane"" game has only two arrow buttons...an ""up"" button and a ""sideways button""...not like the games I've played in real life. Compare this to Carnival Games VR, where all the games have written and spoken instructions, grabbing and using things works like real life, and the physics are good. Best thing about Pierhead Arcade is the streaming music jukebox.","Jul 19, 2017 at 10:20 AM",1, 2,

Liked the tickets that you can win to buy items...toy plane is fun you can throw it and it flies about.I got that with my tickets..there even a jukebox radio in there....you can listen to music..not checked to see if my own music can be played..would be nice to see some fruit machines in there..its fun dont get me wrong.I got it for the children to play..the bowling game stilll seems to need work as others have said..but its limited as after you played the games for abit.Its more than likely wont be picked up again..but the multiplayer,scoreboard and trying to win toys helps keeps the game fun.","Apr 23, 2017 at 9:50 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 15:34:11.288688,wlcling,Good!,"Lots of machines! some give quite a good workout. Considering you would easily spend more money if you went to an actual arcade, this is a great buy!

2022-05-28 15:34:11.303648,Gordo-,Very fun!,"I liked this a lot more than I expected to. I lost track of time and became pretty immersed in the games. Like others have said, the bowling could use some work, it's a bit unrealistic compared to some others out there (new retro arcade felt better), but still pretty fun to play. The basketball also needs some rework, the ball appears to be too big and the game just feels off, maybe look at nvidia funhouse on how they did it which felt closer to the real thing. Everything else was pretty spot on though. The prizes are a lot of fun, I got a kick out of the quadcopter. Looking forward to more content! This is very much worth the asking price if anyone is wondering.","Jan 24, 2017 at 9:23 AM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 15:34:11.348528,Rod,Fantastic,"What a great game - got today for use with the Touch controllers and man, it's just awesome. Exactly like in the video, just a ton of fun to play, controls are dead on accurate. For the price pick this up - it's a title you can go back and play again and again and it's a great title to show-off VR. Just flat out fun. Completely worth the money as is without question... but they have a bit more floor space, would love for them to add a few more games to finish it out.","Dec 7, 2016 at 3:57 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 15:34:14.443250,ChrisTaz1968,"Great fun, good value for money!","An excellent selection of classic arcade games. My three children especially love the fact that they can play their favourite holiday games, over and over, for free! I'm very impressed with the physics, and apart from the 10-pin bowling (which seems a bit off by comparison) each activity feels extremely natural and realistic.

Really good game, great fun at a low cost.","Dec 7, 2016 at 9:58 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:34:14.459207,loregnum,Great!,"Games like this are really appealing to me and I was not disappointed buying this. I enjoy all the mini games in it and while some need some work, most are very well done and I often lose track of time while playing this.

Bowling needs some work on the feel/ball movement and basketball is out of proportion (basketballs and the net are way too big) and needs work as it just feels off, especially when compared to Nvidia's basketball mini game.

I also find the height scale feature to be wiggy. I leave it at the default middle and some games are too low/small but if I slightly lower the scale then some games and items are too big.

I have no idea if the devs plan to add more mini games but I sure hope they do. Even if they don't, I can easily recommend this to anyone who wants to go back to their childhood and get lost in arcade goodness.","Jan 6, 2017 at 12:19 PM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 15:34:14.504087,HiThere_,Exactly what you should have expected,"You know the saying that ""the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts"".

Well this isn't simply a collection of ~15 mini-games (plus some bonus activities), as much as it one big successful ""pierhead arcade simulator"".

My main issue was also with the bowling, but because I didn't like fetching the ball each throw : I think that one requires room scale to work, so you can just walk over to fetch your next ball.

Check for videos, and if you like what you see, that's what you're getting :)

PS : I'm not sure if he's still doing it, but the Developper has been know to add new arcade game patches to Pierhead Arcade throughout the year.","Dec 11, 2016 at 8:48 AM",5, 2,

The fact that it gets such poor peformance on my Titan X (Pascal) also has me concerned for people with weaker rigs and while you can turn down the graphical options, wow does everything get blurry and fast.
