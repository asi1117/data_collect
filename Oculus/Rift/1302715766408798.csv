2022-05-28 14:21:18.011672,Carlos-VR1,A throwback to Punch out in a VR,"I appreciate the fact that this game eases you into VR  by presenting gameplay that you know and loved in the Punch-out games  which very resently had a Wii version that was awesome.  Like Mike tysons Punch out,  you can often be unsure what to do to break your opponents pattern.  It can be fun and frustrating especially when there are seldom any tips out there in the internet.

There is definetly a lot of trail and error in this game,  that not to say you won't benefit from a workout,  I was surprisingly sore in the middle of my back, feeling muscle I didn't even know I had.  You realize not to treat the game as if it has any sort of artificial intellegence,  swingl freely and the game will just block you no matter what. You can only land punches when the game allowes you to.  Its an 8bit game in a 2020 world.   

You can pretend to be as Immersive as you want, by throwing hooks, and uppercuts,  asside from the reactions the opponents gives you,  it does nothing to the amount of damage given,  it's all the same.  Knowing when to block or bob-weave is the tricky part,  but one thing for sure tilting back will do nothing but register as a hit anyway,  so avoid the back ach!

If I had to replay this match the one I would specifically avoid is the Iron Maiden,  it was like a chore/ boring quick time event, not too fun. other then that when your tired of playing and you just want to finish the game I suggest you straight jabs, and stop being all fancy,  save that for a realistic vr boxing game.","Jan 18, 2021 at 11:47 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 14:21:18.056060,An_Underdog,,"There's a lot good about Knockout League, but the basic design of the game makes it hard to enjoy.  

Basically, most of the game depends on quickly reading your opponent's animations.  By default, you don't get to act.  Rather, your opponent acts and you either 1) read their action correctly, then block/dodge and counterattack (e.g. do fun stuff) or 2) read their action incorrectly, try to block/dodge but get beat up anyhow, and not get to fight back (e.g. not do anything fun).  

Since everything centers around reading the opponent, most of the challenge comes from opponents getting increasingly tricky and hard to read.  This results in a lot of time spent misreading and getting punished, until you figure out the opponent.  Then, once you've figured them out, you can beat them fairly quickly and move on to the next opponent for more punishment.

There is a sort of challenge in all of this that's somewhat engaging, but the ratio of fun to frustation wasn't high enough for me.","Oct 21, 2019 at 8:13 AM",2, 22,

2022-05-28 14:21:24.386772,JackDiddley,Unnecessary and overpriced,"Okay so this was one of the first games I picked up for VR when I first got my Rift almost a year ago.  I thought boxing inVR was a no brainer.  At the time I was disappointed.  The opponents do not behave like boxers, they automatically block anything you throw at them unless you do a special combo, and they have attacks that can't be blocked or dodged, you have to look for an indicator and throw a punch at the right time.  It's like playing a mini game in God of War but punching instead of doing button combos.
I have gone back to many of my original games and learned to appreciate them, this is not one of them.
After experiencing other active games, and boxing games I can say I have gone from disappointed to shocked, confused, and even a little annoyed.
In a world where we now have Thrill of the Fight, and Creed, this game is not only unnecessary, but at a price around $30 it is pure robbery.  
I can highly recommend almost any other boxing game over this one at that price. After spending a morning replaying it with my current VR experience, I'd value this around $6.99 tops.","Mar 31, 2019 at 11:45 PM",1, 17,

To dodge that attack, you actually don't need to move very much as long as you lean to the correct side (he actually only slams on one side of the ring).

2022-05-28 14:21:27.540930,taquitobuddy,"Could have been great, hope for KOL-2","Pros: Polished VR experience with perfectly fitting visuals, good soundwork, and lots of content, modes, and features.  Also an intense workout.

Cons: Terrible punching implementation, lack of leaderboards for the (good) training modes

First let me say KO League is a decent VR game if you go into it knowing what to expect and like active VR games that can give a workout.  If so, I'd recommend picking it up on sale.  It has great overall presentation and lots of content, but it could have been so much better if not for some poor design decisions.  

The main offender is punching, which as you might imagine, is a huge deal in a ""boxing"" game.  Punching in the main campaign is absolutely terrible.  The only correct way to punch in KOL is to throw ridiculous rabbit-like short jabs as fast as possible when your opponent is stunned, because the stun lasts exactly the same amount of time regardless.  They have a ""punch strength"" mechanic that doesn't work (4-inch fast rabbit punches do the exact same damage as a giant hook or uppercut), along with a ""momentum/golden gloves"" mechanic that is supposed to reward punch variety, but fails to do so, since it also rewards pure # of punches.  The end result is boring gameplay where you basically do a reaction test/mini-game to dodge an attack/combo, and then wiggle your hands for a few seconds, and repeat.

What is really baffling is that the game engine can clearly recognize 10 different punches, but the devs didn't make any good use of this in the campaign except only 1 opponent (Iron Maiden) where it actually matters where you punch.  All opponents should semi-block when stunned like Iron Maiden, and momentum should only be gained by punch variety.

The training modes are a bit better, but the best modes have no leaderboards.  All told I was dissapointed this fell so far short of its potential and hope they make much-improved KOL-2 one day.  Something like Creed but with the fun, over-the-top opponents and attacks of KOL-1.","Apr 10, 2019 at 4:07 PM",3, 4,Thanks for letting us know how you solved the Oculus Home launch issue!

Click that, and a panel will slide open which will allow you to check a box next to a ""Southpaw"" option.

One tip is to try mixing in some blocking for the attacks that you're finding difficult to dodge.  Depending on his timing, some of his attacks are easier to block, and others are easier to dodge.

•	weight lifting (dumbbells ,bench press),
•	different cardio (punching bags, rope tug thingy (think it’s called battle rope), maybe tread mill)
•	sparing sessions
•	Different leagues to work up to (rookie, intermediate ect)
•	Combination training seems a bit difficult such as 1 left 2 right 3 left 4 right gets confusing after 4 combos to remember and repeat (could just be me)
•	Punching feel like I have to reach out further then I should (once again could be me)

 doesn’t have to get to realistic but would be awesome to train up your character making them stronger faster ect, some of these probably will be hard to do on vr but I reckon it will blow this game apart in interest wise and marketing

2022-05-28 14:21:37.008952,DreamTamer,,"I've been playing this for a while now, and it's one of very few VR experiences I keep coming back to. Definitely one of my favourites! I'm not a physical or violent person at all, so a more realistic boxing simulator would be completely unappealing to me, but I gave this a try just because it was VR, and was impressed to find that it's more about pattern recognition and reaction time so it's possible to master each unique challenge with practice.

And practice has made a huge amount of difference! A couple of weeks ago, I couldn't beat Barrage at all, despite several attempts. Not just because I didn't really know what I was doing, but because I felt like I was literally going to die of exhaustion, I was so covered in sweat and out of breath! Now, after making it to Sir Octopunch in the grudge matches, I can come back to normal Barrage and beat her without being hit or breaking a sweat. Each opponent took me several attempts to finally defeat, but it felt just right, and the victories felt so much more satisfying because of it.

My only minor disappointment is that we don't get to fight our trainer as some super-difficult final challenge! Instead, I just got basically a ""CONGLATURATION!"" screen, which was a bit disappointing after the weeks it'd taken to get there (especially considering the impressive cutscenes introducing each fighter). There was a lot of fun in the journey, though, and I appreciate the grudge matches as a new thing to work through.","May 3, 2018 at 4:33 PM",5, 7,

There is a timing component to blocking properly.  When your gloves turn pink, it means that you've held your block too long, and your gloves will get disabled if you get hit.  This is a weak block.  However, if you time your block (when your gloves are still blue), you'll be able to block and return a punch of your own (this is a strong block).  This is what Doug wants you to do in the section of the tutorial that you are stuck on.  Holding your hands up without moving them won't work, because you aren't timing a strong block."

2022-05-28 14:21:40.180584,JonardBolante,Potential VR Punch Out!,"This experience is like implementing the classic Super Punch Out inside VR! Of course people can see that there is an octopus with a mustache who is a boxer along with many other strange yet fun characters to play against, the game itself is fun. Mechanics such as ""blocking"" punches, ""dodging"" punches, punching at the exact moment right before the enemy executes his/her own punch, all of that is implemented very well. 

However, I still give it 4 stars and not 5 for a few reasons actually. Many people have also complained a little bit about some ""punches"" to the enemy does not register when the enemy is vulnerable. Perhaps the punches from the user is happening too quickly for the game to register it as a new punch and thus simulates the punch going ""through"" the enemy without any impact. Although this is only a small feature, this can take away a portion of the immersiveness to users - as it did mine. 

Another reason I strongly feel like it's lacking is the ability to punch at any given time. Me, as the user, am only playing as a counter striker and can only apply a hit if the enemy punches first or makes a move. I do not have the freedom to punch at a random time. If so, the CPU AI is going to block it 100% of the time, even on level 1. Among all the punch out games, Little Mac or whoever the player is has the ability to throw a jab at level 1 and the AI does not block it. This is not the case. Even from level 1, the player has to wait until the enemy throws the first punch so the player can counter appropriately.

Overall, its a GREAT game with amazing utilization of visual spatial representation and scaling is a strong factor. As a developer myself (and future VR developer), it's an awesome game and I can't wait to see the updates in the future :) Good luck!","Mar 12, 2018 at 12:12 PM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 14:21:40.196541,Dagrum,Good game with some huge flaws,"The presentation is awesome but theres two things that really kill my desire to play this 

- Out of bounds
You can't move your feet to dodge otherwise the game pretty much stops and tells you ""hey, you moved""  which can make some fights like the 2nd one a real pain where it feels like you have to physically dodge out of the way of some attacks but if you do the game yells at you. the only good thing about it is you can cheese it to pause the game if you need water or something mid-fight.


-Offence and Damage
Let me tell you a story, I was fighting Captain Scurvy using only straights, the time ran up and I lost. I went to training and learned the game had a combo system. I went back to fight him with my new combos I learned and I still lost. Frustrated, I fought him again but this time I just did a slapfight/waggle motion whenever I could screaming ""THIS IS OPTIMAL"".....I won. That was the moment that made me realize no matter what you do you can't beat the sheer amount of hits that waggling gives you.


I really wish this game had a star punch or you could charge up your punch for damage or something. Instead they opted to go for ""in the zone"" (which is basically, don't get hit for more damage) but that doesn't fix my core problem of you can just waggle and win because the sheer amount of hits can't be beat by trying to mix up your punches","Apr 10, 2018 at 8:31 PM",3, 7,

I love a game that makes a good ""Arcade"" addition to my library, something I can pick up and rack up points with great graphics.  This is every bit what I hoped for.
It's definitely like Punch Out in VR.  Very polished and very fun.  Extra attention is spent on textures (which you may not see in youtube videos.)  It is a moderately intense workout for a game, and it keeps track of your calorie usage.  And in addition it has a very positive, encouraging attitude without being cartoonish in the least.  Very good game!","Mar 24, 2018 at 4:11 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 14:21:43.354248,robby.mulvany,Not remotely like real boxing,"Unfortunately, this is more like one big quick-time event than actual boxing. You aren't allowed to attack unless your enemy misses a punch. Even if your opponent reaches back for a punch and you hit them when they're vulnerable your punch will go right through them. Most of yourr blocks do absolutely nothing, and the only way to know if they're going to work or not is just by trial and error. Some attacks can be blocked but mot cannot. It's just a very cheap game overall. And the game is way too hard for something that's completely unfair. I'm not sure why a developer would make something so cheap. The game is actually very well made, but the gameplay is beyond cheap and frustrating.","Feb 16, 2018 at 4:31 AM",1, 12,

The training modes provide a lot of replayability and are fun to boot. The only issue I found is that some hits to the face/body don't register when the opponent has his/her guard down. It's a little offputting, but I move past this by memorizing when the vulnerable spots are open, and time my hits accordingly. Anywhow, this is a great addition to VR.","Feb 20, 2018 at 7:35 AM",5, 4,

I may try to destroy that later. I will however now move on to beat the high score on the 2nd enemy. Really great workout. The score normally is not something I pay mind to, but for this. Oh boy is it a motivator. 

  Its a bit sad that to get better score the calorie counter seem to get lower... You kinda give up on playing it as a boxing game to be more effective. Still, despite the calorie thingy showing a lower number, the sweat that is raining from me would argue that its still a really effective workout. 

 I do think it could make it more clear its not really a boxing... simulator I guess. For a real boxing match game you need to look some other place.

 Oh oh oh! And today It had a free update, no dlc stuffs! :D And I have to say I do very much like the changes. More caracters and everything. I think theres like 9?

And sometimes I hit by enemy even I moved my head to right way.

 I really like this game and prefer its arcade style graphics and sound to the serious boxing game on Steam VR but at the moment it seems like one of those old arcade fighting games, it's impossible to land a punch... even when you clearly see your punch actually land. If it isn't your alloted moment to hit the opponant your wasting your time.

Let me address the complaints people have. (1) One person says the game is boring because you just step left and hit, left and hit over and over. That's inaccurate. Yes, you always have to dodge punches, no you can't just step left every time. You have to dodge left, right, lean back, block, and duck... not sure what else you are supposed to do to dodge punches in a boxing game or in a real life boxing match?? (2) Many people have complained that you can't punch whenever you want. Actually, you can, but your punch will be blocked. No, you can't swing your fists whenever you want and expect to land the punches and THATS A GOOD THING. Have you ever played a fighting game, like Mortal Kombat, with a kid? Notice how the kid will just spam punches and kicks and how annoying it is that spamming punches and kicks can often work? Well having a boxing game that allows you to punch freely would quickly devolve into the user flailing their fists around wildely with no technique and no rhythm. This game forces you to get into a rhythm and not flail your arms around like a child. I like it and I'm a bit worried about how Rec Room plans to handle boxing when they add that update, it could be really chaotic and cheap if you can throw your hands around like a crazy person and win the fight.

One major complaint is that it's pretty unforgiving. You have to learn what the designer wants you to do to avoid a punch rather than just avoid them. Sometimes it's counter intuitive.","Jan 28, 2017 at 11:21 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 14:22:14.968295,mrgreen72,"Good production values, shallow gameplay","Very pretty, great artistic direction, runs great, but the gameplay doesn't amount to much more than glorified quick time events. I didn't expect realistic boxing, but still expected better use of VR than that. Very disappointing overall.","Jan 29, 2017 at 12:15 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 14:22:14.985250,afilion,Love it!!!,"Hit detection is spot on. It's a great workout if you play the game like you mean it. 

Love the style of the characters. The fighting is amazing and every character I have fought has been an enjoyable experience.
(((To the Devs)))
The character skin shaders are great while actually fighting, but the training section needs a little TLC when compared...not much though... reflection captures are hitting the roughness a bit hot (Skylight or Post) and underlighting the shader. Also his lip synch timing is offset a bit with the audio...usual early access stuff that needs polish...super small and minor.  I'm pumped this game is already in the state that it is in.  You guys have done an amazing job.  Highly, Highly Recommend!!!","Jan 31, 2017 at 12:47 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 14:22:18.118021,sbankhead,,"Terrible boxing game.  The oppoent will stick his hands high in the air, you hit him in the stomach and you get knocked out.  Complete crap in terms of real boxing.  Its basically bop-it VR boxing.  Hit the opponent the way it wants you to and you win.  Try and actually just box and hit the opponent like real and you lose.","Feb 4, 2017 at 10:34 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 14:22:18.133978,thekjun1,Great game,"does require a little more space to play, turn boundries off on occulus. but overall it is a fun game, really enjoyed it. great graphics, not easy to beat right away, touch controllers worked fine (I do have 3 Sensors) out right entertaining","Jan 30, 2017 at 11:22 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 14:22:18.149937,OG-KAuss,,"Forces you to a spot to even start game.  Does not let you set ""center"" of your place space.  Forces me to the outter boudaries of my play space while my entire usable space is unusable.

>>>Update<<< you can alter the space a bit by resetting your game orientation in the oculus home menu while in game.  This will give you a bit of adjustment.  I barely fit in the play space required and i have about 6' x 4' space.

There is an issue with the light filter on the right lens.  When in a fight, if you close your left eye, you'll see the right lens will have the light filter 3/4 of the way across the panel, while the left lens will have the entire panel covered by the filter.  What you get is a noticeable line straight down the screen on the right side.

Game it self plays ok, but honestly, I feel I don't have control of my touch controllers half the time due to mechanics.  Block timing can disable your punches which makes this game feel more like DDR than an actual boxing game.  It's polished though.","Jan 30, 2017 at 12:55 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 14:22:18.166890,lesnos4r2,,"I REALLY wanted to like this game & i'm sure i will when it works. 
I have a much higher than recommended spec PC so i know that's not the problem.
I know this is an early access game but after more than 10 crashes in a row without even being able to complete a single fight, i just can't give it a higher score.
Once this game actually works (IF EVER), i will be able to give it a much higher score.
I look forward to that day.","Feb 1, 2017 at 7:16 PM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 14:22:18.183845,Xerphesus,Nice visuals but boring,"you do always the same without variations. step left, hit! step left, hit! step left hit ... after 10 minutes its getting boring. i waiting for some updates.","Mar 1, 2017 at 12:48 AM",2, 1,

2022-05-28 14:22:21.293153,IkusaShadow,Knockout League,Looks already great recommended an it will get the player in a workout nice. but in time your player should have an entry to the ring or you can choose to have an entry like the characters do. the fight can be better when you block a hook your shoot directly have a counterstrike now the characters animation gose on to long. when you calibrate the game take have a step forward so you have a bit more space fighting.,"Jan 28, 2017 at 3:15 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 14:22:21.311106,Farnam7,Cool Game!!,"I have now played 5 matches, as well as the tutorial. Initially, the graphics were ""meh"" but then I turned them up to high. I'm not sure why they were turned onto low settings initially. Everything is great, I can imagine where they are going to polish the game off but it works well. Tutorial is slightly annoying but funny bc you can punch your trainer while he's talking. I got through the first boxer on the first match, but 4 matches later on the second character and I have yet too beat it. She gets more fierce as you get her angry. Looking forward to the progress this game makes and possible multiplayer modes, hopefully? Recommended.","Jan 26, 2017 at 3:56 PM",5, 3,
