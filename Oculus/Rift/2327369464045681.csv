2022-05-28 19:21:14.699563,Saebri,very decent short free game,"im still not sold on the golden ration significance, i think its more of just its the only way to mathmatically descibe the cleanest offset resulting in a spiral or branching system, and a lot of stuff is only just close to it, not exactly the ratio but it gets called the ratio. like tons of stuff is probably 1.5 and 1.7 but no one measures close enough to be wrong. for example, the michelangelo painting with them touching fingers is on the ceiling and needs to have specific cropping to be the ratio

the gameplay tho is solid, i just need DLC or a second game to fully convince me on the golden ratio :P","May 11, 2021 at 3:09 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 19:21:14.758406,Gutspike,Want to try,"Hi, I would really want to try this experience based on the reviews it got from other players. My problem is that I cannot find a way to turn off the music.  It may  be a personal problem with me, but the constant music in the background made me take off the headsets. 

Is there any way that the music can be turned of do that the narrator can still be heard?","Oct 6, 2019 at 10:57 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 19:21:17.886040,Redlightning7777,Thanks,"Thanks for the great experience...   never knew about this stuff.   

Not often that someone would spread their knowledge like this dev., it was a pleasurable experience as well.  More should do this.

School should be taught this way.  Would download hundreds more like this.. if I could.","Oct 6, 2019 at 3:18 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 19:21:17.901000,yamilgonzales,Short but entertaining,"Again, the experience is short but very entetaining and educational. As a designer, I have been exposed to this concept before, but presented in this way felt very refreshing.","Oct 28, 2019 at 2:40 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:21:17.915960,Fliwatt,Fantastic,Shows what educational VR can do and has amazing scaling. I am just missing a note that you have to leave the attic in order to exit. I hope this is being used in education some day.,"Oct 2, 2019 at 6:38 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:21:17.929923,Admiral_ACID,Wonderful,"Love it, love it, love it! Ever since Western art and music history class in college, the golden ratio has appealed to me. This experience captures these ideas so well, as well as debunking the myths.","Oct 1, 2019 at 10:37 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 19:21:17.944884,blairian,1.168 stars,"It is a beautiful piece of art, but only passively interesting. Really takes more time than it's worth and at the end I kind of felt like I was being sold a golden ratio religion.","Dec 1, 2019 at 10:08 AM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 19:21:21.046587,A-Jey,An interactive maths experience,"This is a complete new way to look at such things.
Also a good narration.
Playtime about half an hour.

A must try.
