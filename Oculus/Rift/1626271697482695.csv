2022-05-28 15:19:07.428191,Slenderbrine,Stress relief,"I have beaten this game and it was a trip. Honestly the most fun I had was when I was angry. Just feeling that sense of destruction was powerful. It felt so good to smah a vase with a fish or break things with a chair. I seriously recommend this to everyone! If your thinking about buying it just go for it! You won't be disappointed!

Edit: I'm experincing 2 nasty bugs with the weapon challenges, 1 is suck n chuck and the other is the tomahawk challenge i belive its called target practice, where no matter how hard I try it simply won't work. If you can please fix this in a later patch. Thank you.","Aug 3, 2020 at 5:43 AM",5, 21,

2022-05-28 15:19:13.761252,ell808,great game,"this game is great, it is great for stress relief,
There are many weapons to buy with the money you get from destroying the hotel rooms, but there arent many hotels, i hope that the dev(s) would add more in the future
i highly reccomend this game!","Dec 11, 2019 at 2:33 AM",4, 14,New hotel and Mini-game added in the v1.0 update. Hope you enjoy.
2022-05-28 15:19:13.776212,Silk911,so fun but...,Please add this game to oculus quest I would love to play this on the go I think would be so fun to play this while we’re traveling I love to smash things thank you,"Nov 10, 2019 at 5:32 AM",5, 21,
2022-05-28 15:19:13.792169,neuoc,Extremely fun And i have a recomendation,"if you are intererested in the trailer like me than trust me you will love smashing the hotels to bits.  The physics are really good and you can even punch the maid! 
Honestly you really cant go wrong with buying this trust me. 

Hey just wanted to say all the problems where fixed! I really love this game and played each level dozens of times, the one thing that i think would make the game even better is this. Now when i smash up the rooms i dont get to much time before the hotel staff get in the way, this is fun in its own way but it would be really cool if there was a mode like this. The mode could be called anything ""freemode""  something like that, basicly in the mode there would be no staff or time limit just so you can mess around and take your time I think this would be amazing.","Dec 6, 2019 at 8:01 AM",5, 14,"(Updated) Thanks for the update, happy to hear you're all running as expected! Also we added a sandbox mode in the latest update so you can go wild without any interruption from the hotel staff! support@hotelrnr.wolfandwood.co"
2022-05-28 15:19:13.807130,Masamune5454,game is legit fun,"now if the trailor interest you, which it did me obviously, i think you cant go wrong buying this. smashing the hotels were actually fun, compared to my lower expectations. it definately does alot right and makes a fun gameplay loop.
this in turn makes you want to earn more money and get better items. well the pawn shop has them, and they are mostly fun and interesting weapons. some are powerups of sorts.
fun game, and i definately enjoyed smashing everything in sight. 
there is a few gated areas with signs saying content is coming, so i really hope it does come. more ways to destroy, more mechanics, more weapons, all of those additions would be great to me. also the hotels get bigger and cooler each one, and you have to avoid hotel staff or your arrested. great game and cant wait to see more content. also more story like the start would be cool.","Aug 30, 2019 at 10:11 AM",5, 80,
2022-05-28 15:19:13.822090,Jarkl,LOVE THIS GAME 10/10,"So at first i really wanted to test this game. and sometimes games aren't really realistic but this game makes it realistic, like when i punch a walll or anything i will get hurt then my fingers break. This is a fun good game with lots of things you can do I love this so much.","Oct 14, 2019 at 8:09 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 15:19:16.902850,mEch114,i can yeet a toaster,"this game helps me relieve anger and have fun at the same time, i like the way you can unlock new hotels and get new items to, the trailor looked cool and the youtube videos i found on it made it look even cooler, the main reason this has 5 stars is the fact that i can yeet a toaster without causing damage in real life, but i wish you could make toast with the toaster","Sep 18, 2019 at 5:16 AM",5, 17,

My Initial Thoughts:
Ok, wow! I was not expecting this level of creativity, polish and enjoyment. There's lots to do here as you unlock items and create chaos.
In Hotel RnR you sign a contract with the devil to cause as much mayhem and destruction in hotel rooms as you go on tour. Your tasked with avoiding the staff in the hotels and causing enough damage in order to buy more fun toys, weapons. The game also offers some really cool mini-games.
Superb!","Sep 16, 2019 at 11:40 PM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 15:19:16.932770,VIOLENTNS,was fun,it was fun but they made some things literallyt impossible that should be easy. One infamy chjallenge is to throw the TV in the pool. Seems simple right? No the character can barely even pick it up. fix your game,"Sep 23, 2019 at 8:51 AM",1, 8,"(Updated) Hey, we added invisible handles to grab the TV and Kegs. We also made it easier to do damage early game along with a ton of other quality of life changes in the new version."
