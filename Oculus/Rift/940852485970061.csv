2022-05-28 16:12:54.257621,Benja,NO FUNCIONA,"I bought it a year ago and a few months ago it stopped working, I wrote to Oculus and they told me to write to Insomniac, no one was responsible for the fact that the game does not work, and worst of all is that a game is still on sale that it does not work, like many others for example herobound from rift, the oculus store is a disaster, nobody controls the charge and responsible for all the games on sale to work, we will have to write a joint letter to Mr. Zuckenberg so that know how messy your play store.",Jan 7 at 5:00 AM,1, 6,
2022-05-28 16:12:54.271583,olivierRS,it could be a wonder but the game broke,"i would have put max of stars but strangely affter two hours of play the game not start anymore i changed nothing and it works not anymore 
so a wonder giving us an incredible and cut in the story and all like if we had never played because a new issue as soon i start

2022-05-28 16:12:54.286543,jfarnsworth43,I would have liked to actually play this,"Purchased the 2 games remaining in the insomniac bundle and have been looking forward to playing this game for more than 1 year now.  It installs properly but won't start - I immediately followed the very clear template-driven guidance to contact Insomniac.  They acted like they didn't know what I was talking about.  After five contacts without resolution, I tried to request a refund (because the game never started) - but too much time had passed waiting for Insomniac..  Oculus has been very  supportive and we're working through the  trouble shooting (even though the other 2 games in the bundle play flawlessly ) - But Insomniac, I followed your tech support popups and instructions to a ""t"" and sent in my support request form repeatedly.   I wanted to be a raving fan but they have been remarkably unhelpful - Bad show, Insomniac.","Nov 14, 2020 at 2:06 AM",1, 19,
2022-05-28 16:12:54.300506,mattsinger,first person mode plz?,"i love this game, but I would like a first person mode plz. that way, I will enjoy the game more, and actually feel like i am the character. I mean, it is fun, and cool to play, but... I am not a fan of 3rd person vr games.","Feb 2, 2019 at 8:34 AM",4, 22,
2022-05-28 16:12:54.317460,CyberpunkZoro,Pretty disappointing,"So many better games in this genre outside and inside VR (Moss, Hellblade, Chronos) to name a few. I still can't understand why there is no co-op mode in this game. It wouldn't have solved this game's issues but it certainly would have helped. Such a missed opportunity.","Jan 4, 2019 at 3:10 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 16:12:57.432130,jagfirerwalker,Broken by bad controls and boring camera,"I just came over here after playing Moss (5*), Hellblade (5*) and Carly and the Reapaerman (5*). This game, while the graphics are really good and the story is okay, does fall flat by having bad camera and gamepad controlls. There are so many jump that I failed, because I couldn't tell the distance of a jump. I also walked quite a few time in the wrong direction as the camera changed and I couldn't tell from where I came.","Dec 4, 2018 at 9:56 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 16:12:57.447090,FastLawyer,Feel like I wasted $10,"This is not a bad game, but it's just pretty average. It really doesn't take advantage of VR in any way. You could play this game without VR and you really wouldn't notice much difference, except maybe a better camera. It's just a simple brawler. There's better versions, just look at the Batman series. This pales in comparison. It's just rather mediocre. I stopped playing after less than an hour and don't really want to play again. Maybe if you have small children they will appreciate the simplistic nature of this brawler.","Aug 7, 2018 at 1:26 AM",3, 6,

2022-05-28 16:13:00.577717,im.visualcortex,,"Sluggish and unsatisfying combat system, bad animations, slow pace and the most boring brawler ever (yeah, it's so fun to be interrupted every minute). The game just feels like a mobile port. I can't believe it was made by the creators of Ratchet & Clank.

Meh, I'm tired of the awkward camera, cheap deaths and unskippable cut-scenes. Wish there was a refund option.","Jun 21, 2017 at 5:33 PM",2, 4,

2022-05-28 16:13:00.607637,KyzoKyo,Decent but VR not needed,"A decent game with a simplistic ""lets go beat 'em up"" plot and decent combat mechanics. VR is completely unnecessary for this game as you are just an eye in the sky and hop from zone-load to zone-load. Good for the beat 'em up genre, lost for VR as that adds little immersion.","May 19, 2017 at 5:46 AM",3, 4,

2022-05-28 16:13:03.734274,Redgrave145,A polished game that shouldn't be in VR,"I purchased Feral Rights at the discounted price and even then I feel like I spent too much. This is a game that really didn't need to be in VR, it would have worked perfectly and would have actually been much more fun outside of VR. I can't recommend this game because of how shallow it feels, the combat system is average and the story is boring.","Dec 16, 2016 at 11:54 PM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 16:13:03.749234,DeadlyJoe,From the creators of Ratchet and Clank,"This is a AAA game from a AAA developer, and it feels like it. It has a rich story, excellent voice acting. The combat system was well thought out and very fun. Ripping an enemy in half never seems to get old. The action is fast paced, and the control is tight.

On the down side, it is somewhat short. It takes about 8 to 10 hours to complete. A speed run might take a couple hours. There are side missions, but not many. 

Ultimately, it's a solid game that feels just a little incomplete, but that's largely because we are used to games having a wider scope and longer play time. While Feral Rites doesn't rise the the same level of perfection as Ratchet and Clank, Insomiac's voyage into VR proves that that the genera can be directly ported.  This game is absolutely worth your time.  Get it!","Nov 24, 2016 at 9:40 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 16:13:03.793117,rabbitovsky,I can tell work went into it...,"I hate to not like this game.  But it just wasn't fun.  I have played a lot of games in the genre, like the God of War series, and this sir is no God of War.  Meh art-style, with terribly clashing choice of music, and an annoying camera system forced me to put it down after an hour.","Dec 16, 2016 at 7:34 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 16:13:06.884848,UBSERD,"A simplistic brawler, but immersive fun.","Beautifully created worlds with a stylized comic tone. Brutal executions, cool combos, and just a polished experience. A very optimized game that got a bad wrap.","Dec 2, 2016 at 7:15 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:13:06.899807,lordneep,Great Game!,"So this game came out at a higher price point. And it wasn't worth that price, so Insomniac lowered it, giving early adopters several free games as a thank you.

At it's current price point this game is excellent for fans of brawlers. The camera system can be a little disorienting but the guide feature will keep you moving in the right direction and compensates nicely.

Don't let the early low reviews turn you off. This game has a lot to offer to fans of the genre. Well worth the current price!","Oct 14, 2016 at 8:58 AM",5, 4,
