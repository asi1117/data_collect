2022-05-28 17:40:43.095917,rajiv85,Did not even work.,all we saw was a rotating circle indicating that it is loading. We tried this before from utube and it is a nice video.

2022-05-28 17:40:46.304336,Janred94,Absolutely stunning but resolution low,"When you build something like this, with a stunning environment and lifelike looking dinosaurs. Why limit the experience by the quality/resolution? At least make an option for everyone to choose a higher quality and download the additional x GB. 
It is wasted potential, everything is done in fine detail that you just cant see because of the resolution/quality... 
Try to match the resolution of current devices. It is just a video isnt it? Change the settings and render it again! :P","Sep 9, 2019 at 7:49 PM",4, 19,
2022-05-28 17:40:46.319296,VirtuaLieven,"Well, uhm, duh. okay.","First of all, this is not real 3D, it's just a 360 degree video. The images are nice, but it feels like you're watching a movie. And after about two minutes, it's over. Not much to expect. Worst point: the ground under your feet looks like a black hole. They could have done better, at least here.","Aug 28, 2019 at 4:33 AM",2, 12,

2022-05-28 17:40:49.445933,Mach13-13,Not Upto The Standard of Blue,"(I've added to this review in light of a response from the dev- see update below)
Original Review:
I get it... it's free after all, I should appreciate the workmanship that went into recreating this beautiful creature and the cinematic moment.... But I can't.  Why?  well because when you raise the bar by creating the wonderfully atmospheric Jurassic World: Blue you kinda need to at least match it with the next offering.  I'm a Jurassic fan and usually love this  stuff, but as has been mentioned before the graphics are rendered way to low.  When the Apatosaurus is sleeping its VERY hazy...

It's short but that would been fine if the gfx were as slick as the previous outing.  Sorry guys, but its not clear enough even when its supersampled to 1.5x

Such a shame, but i'll stick to scaring the stuffing out of my friends and relatives with the Jurassic World: Blue version as a superb VR demo

UPDATE:  It was welcome surprise to receive a comment from the dev on this (see below).   So... it's an older video that's been brought to Rift... that explains a lot...  Maybe if that had been mentioned in the description it might have managed expectations a little and not resulted in the negative reactions (like Mine).  I guess it will always score less when compared to 'Blue', but on the basis of the devs comment it can't be deserving of a 2* so I've adjusted my score to 4*...  Thank you dev for your explanation.","Nov 10, 2018 at 9:52 PM",4, 36,"Hi Mach13-13, Apatosaurus is actually our first Jurassic World experience - we released it in 2015 for the Gear VR. We recently re-released it for the Rift because of requests from fans. Thanks for watching!"
2022-05-28 17:40:49.460893,FastLawyer,Free & delightful cinematic short,"Just realize this is a very short purely cinematic VR experience. However, they have that Apatosaurus wake up from its nap and then looking right at you. It was nice and worth the download just for that brief moment of awe.","Dec 27, 2018 at 2:21 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 17:40:49.474856,Ki-Tsu-Ne,"Blue was really better, bad sound qualiy",The sound is not according to the image. The music is well balanced but the sound is only audible on the left side. The sound mixing specialist seems to be probably deaf in one ear...,"Dec 8, 2018 at 7:11 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 17:40:49.489816,Mayonnaiseman,Don't Listen,"All the reviews are saying it sucks because ""Blue"" was so much better.  This is actually a VR video that i am pretty sure is a lot older than blue, because originally it was shown to me last christmas on a Samsung VR phone. This video is extremely awesome and it is a VR demo, and it doesn't cost anything, it's short, but you're not paying for it and nobody is forcing you to keep it installed.  So have your parents over, and show your friends this video, and it will be totally worth the 0.00 you paid for it.","Oct 31, 2018 at 2:17 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 17:40:49.503779,grekb,Finally!,"This video was one of the reasons i bought VR! I saw it on youtube back in 2015 and i though ""that must be amazing in VR"". Unfortunately i learned later that it was exclusive for Samsung Gear and i was disapointed. But now it finally arrives on Rift! Ofcourse its a first generation VR video and you can see that from the first seconds. Still, after 3 years, its one of the very few content about dinosaurs in VR so accept it as it is and be happy about it. Its also free, so YEAH!","Oct 25, 2018 at 9:05 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 17:40:52.598502,Alicia_Wonderland,Only About 1 Minute Long,"It took longer to load this than view it! This is filmed so there is no interaction and it's ridiculously short. Teenagers could easily create this using 3D models and free software from Daz3D! Might be cool as a super quick demo for someone who has never tried VR and has no knowledge of 3D models and software, but even they might be disappointed since there is no interaction. Little kids might like it. so giving two stars rather than one. Glad this was free!","Oct 25, 2018 at 1:30 PM",2, 9,
2022-05-28 17:40:52.613461,inceptional,Disappointing,"I really like the Blue 360 videos but this had some display issues for me, with the image having slightly double vision in places and a lower resolution or quality than the other videos appeared to have. And the sound was off too, with most of the dino's sounds coming from the left side of my headset even though it was right in front of me most of the time. Trying to recalibrate didn't fix this sound issue. So not great. 

Also, I really wanna see versions of all these videos in the new 5K format on Rift too--they're already available in this format on the likes of Go, so there's no excuse for them not being on Rift too. Make that happen and I'll bump the score up a little bit. And if you fix the other issues too then It might even get 5 stars.","Oct 25, 2018 at 3:21 AM",2, 3,
