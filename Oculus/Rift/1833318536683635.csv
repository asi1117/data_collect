2022-05-28 14:37:05.670084,KingGamerLive14,A VERY fun game with Severe problems,"ITs a very fun game, but the tutorial skips out on the fact that wands have effects, and how you're supposed to heal(I've had to teach atleast a dozen ne wplayers how to do it). matchmaking is extremely annoying, because it throws you to the wolves making you go against people WAY out of your weight class(it needs a ""please dont match me against this player for 24 hours"" button). The last wands are too expensive, and by my count take more than 12 hours of grinding to get one(this is a generous estimate), or 48 hours of grinding to get all of them. The developers have ""fixed"" this problem, by scheduling events on specific days where you can get extra dust, but it feels like slapping a band aid on a amputated finger, it's not a great solution. Fun, but REALLY needs to fix it's issues, in fact if the above problems are solved in the future I'll come back and change my review (if possible) to five stars, and actively try and get people to play it, because when you're not dealing with those problems it is VERY fun.",Nov 16 at 5:55 PM,4, 39,"We hear you, KingGamerLive14, and we're glad you had fun with the game! The tutorial could definitely use an update now that there are new features, like the Wand Powers, so thanks for the feedback. 

Regarding the wand prices, I'd suggest checking out our event schedule at wiki.wandsgame.com. You can earn the rare wands (and relic dust) much more quickly by doing well in events."

2022-05-28 14:37:05.729924,Rez.me,Strategic 1v1 Between Oculus Devices,"Played this on an Oculus Rift CV1 with my brother on an Oculus Quest. Gameplay was smooth as butter and neither of us had an advantage over the other in terms of hardware. Different spells are more useful depending on the size of the level. Reaching level 10 allows you to pick another set of spells, which helps overcome the advantage one may get based on the size of the map. Currently, I wish there were more maps or the ability to mod and add maps. The ones that exist are beautifully designed. The VR controls are well implemented and easy to use. The tutorial and a little practice will get you over the learning curve. Every VR game is slightly different when it comes to rotation and teleportation. This one feels natural after some practice. Overall, I recomend this game especially for crossplay between Oculus devices (very few games support this).","May 11, 2020 at 9:47 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 14:37:08.845200,Tiger-Claw,Most addicting game I've found on VR,"I've played pretty much every VR game available, and while some have wow moments, this is the only one that keeps me putting on the headset.  There is definitely a learning curve, which I think discourages some folks when they first give it a try.  But I promise if you give it more than a quick glance, this is the game that's going to keep you coming back.","May 5, 2020 at 11:08 AM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 14:37:08.860159,AwesomeEBgamer,Great for crossplay with friends,"Wands isn't going to absolutely stun you like some other VR titles, especially if you have been playing VR for a while. However, for my friend who just got an Oculus Go, we found this as one of the handful of games we could play between Rift and Go. For that purpose, it is very good, and is probably the best candidate for crossplay between the two systems. However, if you're looking for just Rift/Quest multiplayer, there are better options available.","Apr 3, 2020 at 12:51 PM",4, 54,
2022-05-28 14:37:08.876117,Overlord99,One of the best games you can play,"Wands vr is a chess action pack game were u have to put together a strategy to beat your opponent if you want to get good you can join  the decord wands vr were u can meet top players all over the world 
 Now sometimes  there nobody on but this is rare but if that happens use the A1 to learn and get better because  this game is cross plate form so there are some really really good players and also check out magic vr on YouTube you will learn alot if you have any questions go to the discord

2022-05-28 14:37:08.892074,Theflyinhawaiin23,Great starter VR Game!!!,"When searching for VR games you usually have a choice between military shooters, space exploration and gladiator type arena games to get any semblance of action PvP. Wands was simply a breath of fresh air. Movment is built on a ""click-and-point"" teleportation system that is fast and easy yet can be tracked and sometimes blocked by your opponent, so balalncing isnt an issue. Wands have 4 slots to fit Spells into. They range from fast electric attacks that do alot of damage or slow fire balls in which you can control the path of said fireball.  Where this game really shines is in the maps. Each map is alive. It moves to either help or hinder player. Rising and falling platforms, Gas that fills a room to force you to move to another one and a large skeleton that will rise out of a lake of magma and slaps the harry potter glasses off of you. Player count is a little low and its hard to find opponents passed 8pm PAC. Other than that game is great!","Oct 19, 2019 at 9:24 AM",4, 30,"Thanks for the review, Theflyinhawaiin23! We're glad you're enjoying the game!"
2022-05-28 14:37:08.908032,mdwoith,Best VR Game Ever!,I love this game so much! Though now I have an Oculus Quest and am no longer able to play. Will you guys be releasing a version for Oculus Quest? *crosses fingers*,"Jun 9, 2019 at 8:38 PM",5, 20,"Actually, Wands is now out on Oculus Quest!

2022-05-28 14:37:12.007885,Aphid,amazing game,"this a good game to put a few hours into. However, there are some things that could make this game perfect.
#1: a hub where you spawn and can meet other people, instead of the workshop. It would still have all the features of the workshop, exept bigger and open to social activity.
#2: have team battles, like 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3.
#3: a horde gamemode, where 1-5 players battle against either custom amouts of enemies or endless, with diferent difficulties.
for me, this would make the game absolutly wonderous.","Feb 18, 2019 at 7:40 AM",4, 59,
2022-05-28 14:37:12.023842,Belleamie,Can't find friend,"The game looks like fun but I really want to play with my friend.   We can both see the same people out there to duel but we can't see each other.   I have no idea why she doesn't appear on the list.   I would rate this higher but I really want to play with my friends.


Update:  I saw below that the reason may be that she's on a Go and I'm on a Rift.  Can you explain how we can find each other in a public duel?  I can't find her there either.   She has health issues and I bought her the go since she doesn't have a pc to play a rift.   This is one of the only ways she can kind of get out and do things with people so I'd love to be able to play this with her.","Dec 28, 2018 at 9:14 AM",3, 12,"Hey, Belleamie. It's certainly possible for Rift players to duel Go players. When you host a friend, make sure that you select ""Public Duel"" in order to be visible to players on other platforms. While you're waiting in the Lobby, you should be visible to your friend when they select ""Join a Friend"". If that doesn't work, please contact us at support@cortopia.com or at www.discord.gg/wands, and we can investigate the issue."
2022-05-28 14:37:12.040797,Defink,First duel is already vs 'Dueler' rank,"You could have fun with this game, things I experienced:
-Drawing spells is a nerds dream, but selecting them (like this game) has his benefits too.
-I find it too bad that it's only 1v1 and very limited teleporting (But I guess this works too)
-Player base is too small to have a fair matchup. See example.
-Alot of spells (or even all of them) are available from level 1 (if u can unlock them, which you get a token for at level 2)
-Movement is 90ish degree turns: recenter doesnt work for me.

Played it about an hour, Had 3 different people so far and about 6 Games. First one I face is dueler rank, to get an idea: you start at 'goat hoarder' [level 1- until..?higher than 3, since I'm 3 now and still goat hoarder]. The 3th person I face is veteran: the difference in level is visualised by a bar at the top of the screen in the lobby and I'm at the end of it. So is he/she... The other end though...

You get immediate acces to all(?) spells (good thing), it's fair that way.

Every time I go somewhere (lobby, arena, practice area) I get there with my back to the playing area? Also in survival i'm standing at a 45degree angle, and recenter doesn't work at all. You can only move in 90ish degrees so I have to physically face the enemies (which isn't that bad as long as u have good tracking I suppose).

Customizations are good though. Nice characters and wands look good too. I like how every spell has it's little symbol too.","Feb 19, 2019 at 2:39 AM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 14:37:12.055757,AlmondBrand,Good Game,"I enjoyed it myself but moving was hard to do I had to play two matches just to learn how to move. It doesnt really have a good balance fight you could be a level two and fight a level ten. But it has many spells and many custom people to choose from. But I would like to see if the could make it so the other guy can see what your doing with your arms, I think it would make it a lot better then a guy just staring at you.","Oct 19, 2018 at 11:45 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 14:37:12.070717,DreamerO,Worth The Buy,"Updating my early access review from 3 to 5. Game has improved significantly since it was first released, and the developers actively release updates. All suggestions from previous review have been carried out or exceeded. Now the game is much more intuitive for beginners, and there's a survival mode for practice against the AI. Wands is also an active community game, as seen from the Oculus events.

Hoping it's not too much to wish to see any of these:
Team Battles - 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 queues
Multiplayer Survival - Up to 3 people against the AI hordes
Ghost Tower - This is super wishful thinking, but it would be very cool for this style game to have an AI of our characters to fight when offline","May 24, 2018 at 11:04 AM",5, 29,
2022-05-28 14:37:15.195506,MishkiandaJones,Wonderful game!,"Tons of customization, a really unique battle system, and an overall excellent experience. My only complaint is there's no offline/AI mode. If you want to learn, you've got to either hit a stationary dummy, or play against another person. It'd be great to learn against AI first.","Jun 20, 2018 at 11:37 AM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 14:37:15.211464,DrKevKev,Quite literally unplayable.  Don't buy,When I bought this game the requirements were Windows 7 and later.  Never got a chance to play it but went to install it the other day and saw that they had updated the game and now it requires Windows 10.  I don't understand how Oculus is ok with this at all.  They literally decided to break my game after I had bought it.  I understand some games are Windows 10 only but changing the requirements a year and a half after a games release should be illegal.

2022-05-28 14:37:15.242381,TankMissile,"Love it, but...","playing with friends is a nuisance.  Clicking the ""invite friend"" button in a private match does not do anything for me.  I legitimately had to buy the Steam version just to get some kind of interface to invite my friend to play - and obviously, this reset my progress.  Also I effectively had to pay double for the game, and I'm well beyond the refund policy for the Oculus store.  If you want to play with friends at any point, just get it on Steam.

Matchmaking I understand is limited by the number of players, but I think it's really unfair to go against the #2 ranked player 4 billion times in a row and end up with the Gremlin title (I wasn't level 10 yet for the first 3,999,999,998 games) just because you can't play the game otherwise and don't have the experience to play against such a skilled player.  I'm not bad, I just can't compete with someone who has 3 wand sets, more than 3 offensive spells, and the knowledge of how to use and counter every spell in the game.  I don't mind playing against such a person, but I do mind everybody looking at my MMR and thinking I'm a wood tier player just because every matchup was a ridiculous one.

Other than that, this game is everything I hoped it would be.","Jan 22, 2018 at 3:20 PM",4, 21,"Hey TankMissile. Thanks for your feedback.
Unfortunately, the ""invite friend"" option on Rift only works with other Rift players who you have on your friend list and who are currently online. But you can host a public friendly duel in order to play against a friend on any platform."
2022-05-28 14:37:15.258338,Shemham,Pretty poor,"Right from the off it's unclear what does what, the controls are very clunky. I then jumped into a ""multiplayer"" battle to which no-one joined so I started the Duel against a hord, oh my, how dissapointing this was! If I'd paid any more than £3.99 I'd be upset. If I coudl get a refund I would.","Jan 10, 2018 at 3:20 AM",2, 11,The controls have been revamped and there are plenty of people to play now :)

2022-05-28 14:37:18.392108,ratismal,"Looks great, but...","This game looks great. The graphics are quite good, and there is a great deal of polish. It's obvious that a lot of work went into it. The spells are also pretty neat.

However, the matching system is garbage! My first match, I (a level 1 noob) was matched against a level 108. Huh. That's neat. With my very basic grasp on the game mechanics that was taught to me in the basement, I got creamed within seconds. This happened again and again until I got paired against a level 240, whereupon I gave up.

The worst part was that I had no idea *why* I lost. The spells are quirky, and a difficult to figure out at simply a glance. Sometimes I would randomly take damage, other times my opponent would seemingly stare me to death (I later realized it was a lightning bolt, that had little to no animation - just instant death).

I want to love this game, learn it's mechanics, and be able to play with the other characters. However, it simply dumps you into the deep end with no explanation on how to swim. If there was better matching, or even a single player mode to ease you into the game, this game would have a much higher rating than what I gave it. It's a shame too, because the game itself looks fantastic.","Oct 15, 2017 at 12:20 PM",2, 57,"Update: Thanks again for your detailed review, ratismal. Because of feedback like yours, we've made many improvements to the game (and will continue to make improvements going forward). 

Since your review, we've implemented a matchmaking system that selects your opponent based on skill level. Of course, it's still possible to get matched up with a tough opponent if nobody near your skill level is online, but the game is pretty popular right now, so that shouldn't be a major issue. 

There's also an AI that you can duel at multiple difficulty levels, from extremely easy to extremely difficult. This lets you learn the game at your own pace, before diving in to the deep end. 

I know it's been a while since your review, but if you feel like jumping back into the Beyond, now is a great time!"

It took me quite a while to figure out the best ways to load my wand and fight an opponent, but I got there.  I just got the Rift VR as a Christmas gift and downloaded Wands immediately.  I was bummed that my account didn't transfer over from one oculus to another and that there seem to have been no updates to the game at all.  
Still a great game and I look forward to playing again.","Dec 29, 2017 at 11:42 PM",4, 6,"Thanks for your review and your support, himrent :)
Your account should transfer over to Rift from Gear VR as long as you're logged in to the same Oculus account. You might have encountered a bug. If you contact us at discord.gg/wands or at support@cortopia.com, we'll do our best to help you out.
Regarding updates, the game is patched pretty often (usually about once a month). The last update was just a couple weeks ago and included a new Survival Mode and some significant balance changes. You can find the details at wandsgame.com/journal or on Discord."
