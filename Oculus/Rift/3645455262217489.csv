Teachers and educators will be especially excited by this beautifually designed breathtaking experience! I hope every child possible has the chance to be immersed in the realm of our polinating Earth companions!","May 25, 2021 at 10:30 PM",5, 19,Happy we were able to solve your technical problem. Thank you so much for your updated review... Totally humbled! ❤❤❤
2022-05-28 20:12:01.734123,OzWood,5 Stars for Caring - but left in minutes,"Unless I am mistaken, the only form of movement seems to be teleport ? I had my moments of mild nausea in the first few days of VR and got over it very quickly. I get so frustrated with apps that do now allow smooth movement and rapid turning. Please; if you can't virtually walk around these places it isn't a virtually realistic experience.  It's a scene jump with 360 vision. Let me know if I can explore and I will come back","May 28, 2021 at 2:56 PM",5, 14,"Dear OzWood, thank you for caring and your useful feedback. We've added the free-moving option on our todo-list. Will probably not have it als default navigation system because of the possible nausea-issue, but you will be able to activate it via diary/credits/settings popup. Keep you posted!"
2022-05-28 20:12:01.749083,RuneSR2,Awesome and important learning app,"This app may be considered extremely important, especially for persons unfamiliar with the issues communicated through the app. This app is great for learning - and also shows the great power of VR as a learning platform. 
The app does not take up much space, only 800MB, but looks like a 10GB app - and contains several videos, even 360 degrees. 
There's only teleport for now, but devs promised to add full locomotion later.
I'm suspecting that the app was made for 1st gen oled hmds, at least it looks great using my Rift CV1 with super sampling set to 2.0. 
The app might take about an hour to complete - if you check out everything. Highly recommended!
I had no technical problems, the app worked flawlessly - using Rift CV1 ss 2.0, RTX 3090, i9 10900K, 32GB PC3200.","Jun 6, 2021 at 6:01 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:12:01.763045,UtopiaImmersive,Perfection.,"The best immersive education experience I have ever done. Conveys more words than a 1000 page textbook. If this is the future of VR, then we are going in the right direction.","May 28, 2021 at 2:00 AM",5, 7,

I would love to scope around the surroundings - but the game never launches - the only thing i get to see in my VR headset Oculus Rift S - is the dome and thats it...",Jul 2 at 11:40 PM,2, 0,That is very strange... Do you get the menu in the beginning? Which language did you choose? Feel free to mail us for support wim@poppinswayne.com
2022-05-28 20:12:04.906777,kirkbeckstown,Steer Clear,every timei run this app it locks my screen and controllers dont work I have to restart my PC so i will ununstalling this pretty quickly,Jul 4 at 9:02 PM,1, 0,"I really would like to help fix this problem. When your screen freezes, what does it show? The app does go into pause when the headset is not on your head (Required by Oculus). Could this be the issue?

2022-05-28 20:12:04.921737,Artist3d,Well orchestrated and scripted,"It is always a challenge to convey the sometimes dire consequences of human impact, intentional or otherwise, on the world of nature. This virtual reality tour establishes a decent template with a personalized story and well-developed imagery that delivers a coherent message. I love the flowering option of urban dwellings that suggest these high-rise apartment 'hives for humans' could also be a significant solution to so much concrete and asphast, given how many choose to live in cities. This, along with the general layout of a Pollinator's Park, suggests a natural, expanding and fractal-like matrix of solutions. An excellent production all round. Thank you for the attention to this issue.","Jun 3, 2021 at 3:54 AM",5, 1,

Minor issue when I was in the food room, I put my headset down to have a bb, and I ended up in the lake. It took a bit to figure out how to get back.","Jun 13, 2021 at 1:39 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 20:12:04.950660,Matakage,Wonderful experience for kids and gamers,"If you've got a kid to experience this, it's a must-have. If you're a gamer who just wants to check out a cool looking world for free, get it!","Jun 2, 2021 at 10:21 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:12:04.966617,Mathmatics01,Cool experence save the teleport.,Very cool. Would honestly be a 5 star if it had free movement. Teleport ruins the immersiveness.,"Jun 11, 2021 at 6:52 AM",3, 1,Thanks for your review! We're looking into adding free movement option in our next update.

2022-05-28 20:12:08.105814,Samiel_6,Beautiful,"That was beautiful. I already see the plants and insect disappearing, and it makes me very upset. Trees are struggling, there is less life out there already. I have a very very small garden, but I keep it wild. I think as I can't fit any more in my garden, i'll start planting climbers for the walls.",Jul 3 at 4:10 AM,5, 0,"Thanks, we're also trying to make our small city garden more pollinator friendly... ❤❤"
