2022-05-28 13:44:58.695495,Cmr.rbug,"Awesome game, Solo is ruined by AI helm","This game is absolutely amazing, to be in command of a Federation Starship is out of this world, and the system depth, (while at times not fully explained) is SUPERB. Aside from having to install the Ubisoft software to get it to start, I haven't had any technical issues either, although I haven't played online.

That being said, this is absolutely a game to play with a team. If I had a team of 3 people, this would be 10/5.

But, if you have to play in solo, your experience will be utterly ruined by the absolutely aweful helmsman. I was rescuing survivors of a space station, a Klingon bird of prey drops cloak, so I order my helmsman to approach the target. What does he do? He rams into the nearest asteriod, and sits there. I had to take over to get off the asteroid. Later, 2 more Klingon bird of preys drop cloak and attack. I destroy the first and helm is working fine. I order him to persue the second, aannndddd he sits there. He proceeded to sit there for the next 30 seconds making sure I couldn't get any shots off with my phasers. Just slightly pivoting left and right like he's riding a wave. There isn't even an obstacle in sight. I was manning tactical so I couldn't take over. Instead I just had to fire my torpedoes and try to interupt his targeting while my hull is collapsing around me thanks to my helmsman that didn't gradute high school let alone the academy. That was ONE mission. And that went relatively well. It's like this or worse on every single mission.

So I plan on buying another copy I can play with visiting friends on another computer because I love the game and am addicted, but the helmsman is ruining it.

If you have at least 2 people, this game is a MUST. If it's just you, stay away. It's awesome, but you're just going to get infuriated by Ensign GetLostAndRunIntoRocks.",Dec 7 at 1:00 PM,2, 23,

2022-05-28 13:44:58.725415,aaron.murakami1,suddenly says the services are not avail,So thge first review mfor me personally on the oculus store and it is not going to be a good one. Purchased thisa game at full price not on sale and played it for a bit. Got distracted with life and decided to come back and play some more i went to load it up and keep getting error codes 17-6 to be exact over and over. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling both the game and UBISoft connect which you also need to play stil get the same error code this is not acceptable to make usersd pay for a game and then 1 not have it cross compatible between quest 2 standalone and with the link cable they want you to buy the game twice which will never happen with me at least. Then when you are finally done jumping throughg al the hoops you can't play anyways because the game apparently doesn't exist on the ubisoft servers anymore since i have tried at least a dozen times on different days to get on only to have the same error code come up 17-6 services are unavailable at this time hopefully we can get our money back at least if not i will most likely never purchase another game through oculus and just use syeam to play all my games from now on. if they brick my heradset for speaking my mind then i guess it just proves that even though you purchased the device you don't actually own it if you owned it you could do whatever you wanted to it andf it should still work not have to worry about having it turned off because someone doesn't like what you have to say. This game would have ben good but without being able to play it i just wasted a lot of money and time for absolutely nothing will submit a tcket to see if the oculus team can figure it out or ask them to refund my money since they have sold me aan unplayable game and shouold have informed all users if the service was going to be discontinued for any reason,Aug 21 at 9:57 AM,1, 23,
2022-05-28 13:44:58.741373,fuse99,Would be an amazing if it wasn't broken,Unfortunately as I have figured out after trying to get the game to work for more then 3 hours I have found the game to be extremely buggy on the quest (IE when joining a multiplayer session you lose complete control of any console you are on and desync from the rest of the group) unfortunately Ubisoft no longer supports the game I will not be fixed in the future. Overall I would not recommend this for quest users however for PC it's a great game.,"Jun 10, 2021 at 3:31 PM",1, 13,
2022-05-28 13:44:58.755840,JoelGould,Too many bugs - save your money,"My friends and I all bought the game to try to play as a team. We spent a few hours trying to get through the first mission. 

First of all, there are audio problems, as in during the game some people will not be able to hear selected other people. One person, the captain, count not hear anyone, even though two (not three) other players could hear her. Restarting the game fixed the problem, but meant we had to give up the mission.

Then, the controls for one player would stop working. In one run through, the tactical panel stopped being able to use the system interrupt feature (when it was required). When we restarted, in another run through, half way through the mission the helm offer station stopped working. No way to move the ship. We had two players leave the game, and then rejoin and swap roles, but that did not fix the problem.

It is impossible to complete a mission because of the bugs. Save your money until Ubisoft fixes the game (if ever).","May 3, 2021 at 8:19 AM",1, 22,
2022-05-28 13:45:01.884070,Liasan,Ubisoft knows this game does not work,"I bought the game and it says it has already been claim by someone else when I try to open it. This was Ubisoft's response after the form letter they typed in chat:
Me (2/26/2021, 4:57:50 PM): so what you are telling me is that there is nothing you can do about this? 
Ubi-Sandstorm (2/26/2021, 4:58:33 PM): At the time, we have no recommended troubleshooting. Our team is investigating the issue at the moment. I apologize for the inconvenience! 
Me (2/26/2021, 5:00:40 PM): why would a game that I just bought say that it's claimed by someone else? 
Ubi-Sandstorm (2/26/2021, 5:01:05 PM): I wouldn't have any additional information to provide as this is an issue under investigation at the moment. Our forums would have an update once one is available. 
Me (2/26/2021, 5:01:10 PM): and the error message says to contact you. 
Me (2/26/2021, 5:02:06 PM): I would like to talk to your supervisor. 
Ubi-Sandstorm (2/26/2021, 5:02:56 PM): I apologize for the inconvenience; however, this is not something that can be escalated. 
If you have any additional queries, I would be happy to assist. If not, please enjoy your night. 
Me (2/26/2021, 5:03:32 PM): why can this not be escalated? 
Me (2/26/2021, 5:03:59 PM): is it company policy to ignore customers? 
Me (2/26/2021, 5:04:29 PM): and not care that they spend money on your products and then cannot play your games? 
Ubi-Sandstorm (2/26/2021, 5:06:45 PM): Once again, I am sorry for the situation. As this is an issue currently being investigated, we have no additional information to provide, nor can we provide a key or activate the game on our end at this time. Once any information regarding this issue is available, it would be posted to the forums. 
Me (2/26/2021, 5:07:30 PM): if this is a know issue, then why are you still selling this game to customers that you know cannot play it? 
Me (2/26/2021, 5:07:44 PM): that is the same as theft","Feb 27, 2021 at 10:21 AM",1, 164,
2022-05-28 13:45:01.900027,MezNL,Do not buy this game right now,"I've had this game since it first came out. Within the past week or so I've been unable to play on the RIFT/PC. Says that the game has been claimed by another user. Ubisoft Support is aware of the issue but have no solution, nor are they providing any updates. I also have it for the Oculus Quest 2,  which I thought might be a good option while the first issue was being resolved. It's incredibly buggy there and is unplayable. I've convinced people to purchase a Quest 2 just to play this game. Those folks are not happy with me right now. 

Check the ubi forums for both of the issues listed above, there are many people with the same problems. This game should be avoided right now. Sorry to say as it was a good game prior.","Mar 2, 2021 at 4:04 AM",1, 47,

But when I try to play this weekend, I get a message stating that someone else has claimed my product.  It was working, now it is not.  Ubisoft support was no help, stating that it's a known issue, but unable to answer when they expect it to be fixed.  Unfortunately, this ruins my big virtual gaming night.  And to top it all off, I've now owned the game for 15 days, so just outside the 14 refund period.  :(","Feb 28, 2021 at 2:31 AM",1, 38,

2022-05-28 13:45:01.944907,mpdivo,So much potential but Ubisoft...,"At the start, it's emotional...in VR, on a shuttle to your first ship, it's amazing an immersive.  The game is complex and has the added bonus of being able to be a crew member on the original Enterprise.  Makes you realize how much training has to go into flying a ship using Christmas lights in a wooden set piece (circa 1960s).  Ubisoft...for some reason thinking that they are going to be the next EA or Steam has tied this game to their app.  So, it often forgets your password even though you have clicked the ""remain"" signed in...and this is where the problems start.  I feel bad for the developers because they made a great game but it's hampered by their ubisoft overlords.  It's a decent game if you can get to it.  If you are a Star Trek fan, it's worth trying if they ever get through the bugs (it doesn't look like it).","Mar 14, 2021 at 11:36 PM",2, 13,

Happily collecting peoples money while they know their game barely functions, pretty shameful. Exploiting the Star Trek brand to rip people off.

2022-05-28 13:45:08.268807,DrPhilSwift,"Great, but...","I like this game, it is great don't get me wrong, but it seems that Ubisoft doesn't care about STBC anymore. There are a slew of problems. One big thing is not that many people play it. Also, at the time of this review they cancelled their rental/use of IBM's Watson Voice Command, now you have to dig through menus (or take over) to command your crew instead of just using your voice. They rarely push updates out for the game, and they haven't really added anything to it since 2018. There are somewhat small boundaries in the map too. If you want a space game find something else, if they update the game then maybe not. There are other better games that have more attention put into it, for example Elite Dangerous. I feel they could have done better.","Sep 10, 2020 at 9:23 AM",2, 80,

The direction the game should go with is of the recent film design and graphic which the USS Ageis represents and is remarkable. Yet as i respect the oldies the graphics and interface is off putting (in my own opinion) yet as the ageis is a new ship i would have thought that hull repairs would be better rather than nonexistent; introduce a repair station, longer and more variety of enemies for the Agies would be great update and direction for the game. With Star trek new films and sublime netflix show (uss discovery would be a godsend addition) you have great potential. Also normal travel takes a bit longer than expected from a galatic ship and third person personal missions would put the crème de la crème on what is one of the best representation of space exploration. Please ubisoft make it as great as it should be ive played assassin creed i know you have it in you. Make a compelling game and people will come, this will help the multi-player aspect.

2022-05-28 13:45:14.599100,OrionInHades,Some Frustrating Issues,"I want to be fair, so here is my personal assessment.

Negatives:

1. Why can't we have exploratory missions, or anything without continuious life-and-limb circumstances? I'm so sick of the Klingon's or Borg showing up to try and kill me all the time. It's like this game was scripted by JJ Abrams.

2. Voice commands were working, and now they are not, and UPLAY support SUCKS! Without voice commands the game is not nearly as fun.

3. Star Trek based trophies for the Oculus home would be nice. Something to make the Oculus folks feel a little more special than the PS crowd.

4. Almost no substantial updates or improvements are made. And I have paid for one of them hoping things would get better. This is dissapointing considering the IP we are dealing with.

Pluses:

1. Good graphics. I like the bridge and crew renderings. I like the star fields, and the transitions to warp and impulse.
2. It's Star Trek (So you get a point for nostalgia)
3. I really enjoyed it when voice commands were working (And it isn't me. Even the game sees my mic test. It just won't carry over into gameplay)

Overall: Lots of potential, and a great IP with some really good exectution on roughly 60% of the game. But there are important issues that impact a truly favorable assessment. I don't honestly know that I would buy it again had I known then what I know now.","Apr 25, 2020 at 10:27 PM",2, 48,

Most players actually roleplay thier positions  on voice . The teamwork it requires is a perfect fit for multiplayer and VR and Star Trek!  The single player game is fun also. It teaches you all the postions as  you can fine tune certain things just jumping into the position yourself. This game really sparks the imagination of what games will be like eventually when coding is even more crunched and the depth and scope is greater. Away teams. Maybe a persistent world .

2022-05-28 13:45:20.962285,The_Witchdoctor,A Total Waste of Time and Money,"First off the program crashes more than it does not.  Frequently, at the very begining, it asks you to reset the view, and then does it again and again until you quit without ever playing the game.  But that is not the worst of it.

This game sucks to play by yourself, but it is nearly impossible to find strangers to play with you.  Consequently, unless you have 3 other freinds who are going to sign in together at the same time, forget playing with anyone else.  To find friends, I even searched online to find people who were also looking to play and tried adding their names to freind list...but if they do not know you, why would they accpet a friend request.  If you want to play with others, there is a room with a max number of 4 players that can be in the room.  When you arrive, you will be by yourself and with nothing to do.  15 minutes later, that has not changed.  

I'm a Star Trek fan!  The idea sounded great!  I'm terribly disappointed with this game.  I hope someone else will make a better Star Trek Game.  Until then, don't waste your time or money.","Dec 31, 2019 at 10:14 AM",5, 37,

It's gaming longevity probably lasts as long as the novelty though. The missions are pretty basic on top of that. I recommend it though because it puts you on the bridge of a Star Trek ship and it is amazing! Best played with friends but we know how that goes with the current player counts in VR. And with this being an older game. VR games seem to age very very well though.

 Only 4 stars because I had activation issues with Uplay. I am not one who usually bashes Uplay either, I had legit issues.

When it worked however, you can expect a whole new experiance! when you launch the game you are thrown headfirst into the Star Trek universe! 

Pros:
-Immersive, very detailed interiors and themes!
-Star Trek style adventures! 
-Quite alot of replayabilty
-Exellent atmophere!
-Challenging at times!

cons:
-Very 2 dimentional interface, perticularly in Captain role where you click buttons to complete scenarios. it doesn't feel polished.
-No official Star Trek music (that was a killer :( )
-Ultra dumb AI, it is very common for them to take shortcuts into obsticals as though they arn't there.
-Avatar customisation is somewhat non- existant (verly limited range of features) 

These being said, if you are a fan of Star Trek, you will love this game regardless! it sets the atmosphere perfectly! If you are not a fan, i'd recommend a look but it may not be as enticing.

So Uplay and the few cons aside, i still will give this 5 stars for bringing Star Trek that bit closer to reality!","Dec 6, 2018 at 4:34 PM",5, 11,

The game basically does deliver an immersive experience. You really do feel like you are on the bridge of the AEGIS or original Enterprise.  Grapically, the bridges are well represented and the sound effects are on par with Star Trek. Unfortunately, because of 'Screen Door' effect with the Oculus headset, some of that grapic sharpness and imersion is lost because of it but not overly so. A minor flaw.  The missions range from basic rescue operations to multi stage complicated scenarios.  IF YOU ARE A NEWBIE at this game I will warn you now! Play the AEGIS missions first before attempting the original Enterprise, as the control layout for it has a high learning curve and you will need the help overlay to master it and even then its not highly intuitive. Enterprise is for seasoned vets looking for that extra layer of difficulty.  
But all in all, this game really does deliver on fun! Its even MORE fun in multiplayer when you have a squad that wants to play their roles in a serious manner, not like idiots. Definately 4/5 stars!","Sep 19, 2018 at 7:10 AM",4, 10,

I'm still kind of new to virtual reality so I don't really know what to expect, but this game feels like it could be so much more. It needs lots more solo stuff to do, and pvp would be spectacular. I'm concerned about losing Watson voice support, because right now you can actually have some decent fun playing with an ai crew. I hope they either find a good replacement or extend the support.

Speaking of support, that is why I'm kind of salty. I couldn't figure out how to get the voice commands set up. I submitted a ticket on their support site, and never heard back from them. After dropping fifty bucks on their game I don't think an email is too much to ask. Eventually I got it sorted out myself, but I spent a lot of time figuring it out when I'm sure they could have just given me some directions. Maybe I am just expecting too much, but I'm pretty underwhelmed at this point.

I think the game is worth it though. The visuals are stunning, and what content there is is engaging and fun. I have to be in the mood for multiplayer though, which is why I wish there was more solo content. We'll see how it holds up and what updates might be in store.

The intro trying to recreate the intro of the show is a joke and looks like someone made it with powerpoint . I honestly can't understand the lack of ...everything . 
Gameplay wise , on deck is alot better . The body and distance analogies seem to have been corrected and the crew sitting next to you feel the right size for the distance they are . Also the addition of being able to play standing up when on the tactical station (worf's position) gives this an extra touch . Has a number of glitches most importantly whoevers idea was to have a right handed tablet holding only . I am right handed , but would like to be able to choose which hand picks up the command tablet . More glitches when it comes to controlling the vessel , and in general , ingame graphics are very dated . Ubisoft seriously needs to start thinking of using a modern graphics engine instead of unity . seriously ... 


I pre-ordered this game ! Could not wait to play it as it was basically the only reason i got VR . Ubisoft however nowadays seems to be a synonim to outdated graphics . Bad lighting and texrures give a very childish feel to the game and the general graphics are of almost 10 years out of date . Its sad concidering that Star Trek is about the feeling , the chance to actually feel that you are inside the Star Trek universe , as opposed to Bridge crew that feels like something between cartoonish graphics and some random space app for iphone . Playwise , the single player mode is boring at best with very limited features in terms of gameplay and explorations - Exploration , that one thing that Star Trek is actually based on - . Multiplayer is fun if you and your mates play , playing with random people on the next either ends up with supernerds that it take it waaay to seriously or kids that dont .

Star Trek has always gone against the grain as a storytelling adventure (particularly the first season of TNG) by pitting humans up against forces of nature.  Yes, there are villains and yes, there is combat, but quite often, the heroes are up against the elements and must work the problem to save lives.  An asteroid is hurtling toward a planet: go!  We who play this game have seen the show, seen the movies: shoot a torpedo at the thing, lock on tractor beam, extend a subspace field around it, technobabble the heck out of it.  I've always wanted to control a Federation vessel to solve distress calls with open-ended solutions and unexpected consequences.  Why have I not knocked off a star for this? Well, because that's a pretty tall order.  Most of my complaints are a bit cosmetic, really: the atmosphere is almost exclusivey new Abrams.  They included the retro Enterprise and a TNG Enterprise D is on the way, but it's a real shame the Star Trek I grew up with is an afterthought.  Long and short: it's a fun game and, like most VR games, woefully short.

The feeling you get when you lean back in your captain's chair saying ""prepare for warp"" and your crew members respond with ""aye aye captain, plotting warp course"" ""charging warp coils"" or ""hang on a second I need to find the buton for that first"" is simply brilliant.

2022-05-28 13:46:02.072903,AhsanFireking,Very GOOD Experience,"Well, like some of other players, I paid $4.99 for this (like 90% discount yay!).  Grabbed it fast enough at 60% discount and spending the outage compensation credit.  This game being my first purchase on Oculus store.  Overall experience, has been very good.

Those who are having trouble connecting/finding other players, need to change the region.  Europe and NA are so far have quite a bunch of people playing the game.  And of those of you looking or struggling with training, I'd advised try to focus on a single role for the first 5 games, and move onto the next.  Get a grasp of the game from a single angle will help you much to understand the concept.

Ok, I met somebody, he played captain and I played as an engineer at my 3rd mission.  He guided me well enough to let me pass my first mission successfully (my 1st and 2nd game was a mess).  On my 4th mission I played with a boy and an adult, just 3 of us controlling the ""original enterprise"".  its my first time with the ship, the configuration is totally different with the ""Aegis class"".  At the end, I got my rank to Lt. Junior grade (or somewhat like that).  All of those experience as an engineer are very well memorable for me.  Shifting powers, operating transporters and managing repairs are the critical role of an engineer for the ship.

The game can be call as the platform for a social interaction.  It will be as immersive as the players wanted to be.  Responding ""roger that captain"" vs ""ok"" will make the experience much differ.  So content is not as important.  Despite it is being as a social platform, I'd still doubtly think the game will last very long for me.  In my experience, once you see an 'experience' of a new game turned to be just ""a game"", then it lost its soul on that moment.  Where you start thinking you know all the mechanics, and start swearing to your 'noobish' allies, when all the 'wow' factor depleted.  I'm just hoping this will not be that fast.  But again for $4.99, I'll be content to that.","Mar 19, 2018 at 1:57 AM",4, 10,

In multiplayer it is more of a social VR experience, because the actions of an individual bridge crew member are limited, but being captain is cool and in hot situations every job counts and can become a challenge. Multiplayer has it's moments when you find the right people to play with, which happens quite often (but only in English language, German matchmaking never finds a player match). - This said, in 2 or 3 intensive gaming nights you are done with the game, except if you are a real addictive Trekkie. The campaign is short with only 5 episodes and prologue. The game can radomize an infinite amout of missions and this is fun, especially for showcasing VR to friends. - @Ubisoft it would be totally awesome to have a mission creation tool (no voice needed) and if people could share and rate missions and even self-made campaings.

Why ?

Well the game is pretty boring.. You can select one of 4 different locations where you on each crew station can push a few buttons with either AI crew or friends/community. The goal is to work together and fly the ship. Sometimes you need to work together more than other, example chief mechanic need to give more power to wark engine so pilot can jump and so on... But very simple.

The game is boring since there is not much to do and it is very simple.
There are no away team where you beam down and get out of your ship and explore or shoot anything.. You just sit in your chair on the bridge and click a few buttons.. THough this is interesting at first then it extremly fast become boring and very simple... Depening what other human crew members you have this can either be a good or bad experience.

I am just saying there is not much ""game"", go from a-b... Jump to location A and when you arrive target ship, scan/hide/fight/teleport  repeat., .  I feel truly sorry for people who paid full price for this product it is not worth it...

Buy  ""echo one"" instead, beautifull game.

2022-05-28 13:46:59.225652,chromium21,A mile wide... and an inch deep,"Don't get me wrong: I spent a fair number of hours enjoying this title. My first missions I was full of awe as I was impressed with being on the deck with 3 other crew working closely together to complete missions. I had to rely heavily on every one of my  teammates to be successful, much more so than in any other genres I've played (MMO's, FPS, MOBAs, etc. where underperforming members can be more or less ""carried""). If any one mate isn't performing, the mission can become very tricky (or, in some cases, impossible) to complete. This fact is one of the title's biggest strengths if you enjoy teamwork, but it can quickly become a source of great frustration if your Quick Match with a particularly difficult crew mate.

Given that this title relies so heavily on teamwork, I feel it is important to speak to the quality of the community. I found the community to generally be welcoming and friendly. Most are very enthusiastic about Star Trek (or Sci-Fi in general), and are willing to help and teach others so that they can enjoy the experience. The (rare) times I've had issues are 1) young children playing or 2) a teammate not taking things seriously (or sometimes taking them too seriously!)

My prime complaint is that the game begins to stale once you become familiar with the 4 roles. You'll likely quickly master the 3 ""direct"" roles: Engineer, Tactical, and Helm; then, for those that wish to take on a more leadership and decision-making position, I would recommend playing Captain. It is very helpful to have a keen understanding of the other 3 ""direct"" roles prior to being Captain so that you can give relevant and timely guidance to crew mates, particularly those that require or ask for more direction. But because there are few  story missions, and the procedurally generated missions aren't remarkably different from play-to-play, no PVP, even playing as Captain can begin to bland sooner than hoped.

More like playing the animated series than a more realistic version. The rigging of the models needs some help as well. The movement of the hands and arm are hysterical at times. I had no problems playing with people on diffferent systems. We actually had Vive, Oculus and PSVR all playing together well. Its a little slow moving at times but then Enterprise wasnt always on Red Alert.

2022-05-28 13:47:05.580395,1ce_man,"Could be cheaper, but good game.","Really this is just a VR version of Bridge Commander. The Ongoing mission is a bit of a rip, goes back to the briefing room after each mission. I feel Ongoing means, just keeps going until you've had enough. But really it just means randomly spawned missions based on the storyline that will bring you back to the conference room after every mission.

Overall good game, but it really could be cheaper for what you get. What I would love to see in game is: More sequence interaction for the TOS bridge (Really more buttons to push, those panels are so under-used), Shuttle missions would be nice to see, and I would absolutely love the ability to turn off the Computer constantly telling me whats broken. I got it, the Warp Core is offline, its very annoying. It also takes away from the player giving the information to the Captain themselves. If nothing else, please give us the ability to turn off that computer. Voice commands work well enough, as long as you issue the orders correctly. Wish they added that to the tutorial. I find I spend more time just talking to people in the Briefing room as its socially more appealling then trying to do it while in a session. Speaking of which, maybe add some social games so that we can pass the time while waiting on another player. Needless to say, I have a whole list of thoughts for a possible expansion.","Jul 5, 2017 at 1:25 PM",4, 12,

2022-05-28 13:47:08.780947,CaptainStrongNuts,Updated Review,"When I first got the game I had problems launching the game, those problems are now resolved so I can leave a more fair review.  The game itself is fun, if your playing with people who make it fun.  However the game play is very repetitive as all you can do is stay on the bridge and do your job and work the controls at your station.  It would be nice if you could tour other parts of the ship, or maybe perform sub-missions maybe in the engine room or sick bay.  It would be great if you could warp onto other ship, or planets and get into phaser battles.  In the show, the bridge crew never stays in the bridge, they are always going to planets and sneaking on other ships etc.  It would make the game a lot more interesting if this was a possible update down the road.  Overall, I'd give it a B experinece, you really do have to learn the controls which makes it interesting but due to lack of things to do I can't give it an A.","Sep 9, 2017 at 9:03 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 13:47:08.798899,Dethfuse,Fantastic even for non Star Trek fans,"Before I start my review let me just say I never understood why anyone enjoyed the Star Trek tv series. Regardless, this game is fantastic. There are four positions you can play and each requires cooperation from the others. Thankfully each position is pretty simple to figure out which makes playing with random people go smoothly. The only hurdle I've run into while playing is the difference between warp and impulse but besides that it's very easy to pick up on. The missions can actually become difficult quickly but if everyone is working together you can overcome any challenge (usually by running away lol). The multiplayer is definitely the best part, though the singleplayer is still fine since you can switch between any position. There are AI that will control any seat you aren't in and you can even order the AI around with voice commands. Best played sitting down with the touch controllers.","Jun 25, 2017 at 8:11 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 13:47:15.233927,natswright,"Fun but, Multiplayer broken on release","I was really looking forwards to this game and playing the single player for a bit was great fun.

However the problems started when I tried to invite friends to a game, simply put, I cant, seems a massive day one bug has stopped anyone who buys the game via the Oculus store from joining anyone in a private game. Joining a random game is ok, but thats not the point.

With multiplayer the main thrust of the game, its inexcusable that such a bug could not have been spotted before release. There are many threads online and many affected by the issue, yet nothing has been done to look at this.

You might think me impatient, but other games makers are quicker to respond and aknowledge such problems.

Ironically, had I bought the game through steam, it would have worked fine, no so Oculus store.

Edit : Looks like the cross platform bug was fixed, so i'll update my review to reflect that.

Multiplayer is awesome and this is the best game by a mile for co-op VR games. The campaign is a little short, but there are randomly generated missions that prolong play and all missions have replay value taking on different roles or playing with different friends!","Jun 1, 2017 at 8:00 AM",4, 19,

While visually the game captures the spirit of Trek, it's closer to Abrams version, where the heart and sole of diplomacy and moral philosophy are traded in for phasers and torpedos.  It doesn't help that you are more likely than not to lose 1 or 2 crewman to connection issues during a session, and their AI replacements are incapable of fufilling their duties to complete the mission.","Jun 28, 2017 at 6:00 AM",2, 2,

A few games manage to do some amazing visuals but fail on the actual game - others like this have an amazing game mechanics but the visuals are a bit too cartoon like. 

Surface stuff like voices that often do not sync with the characters that are speaking just feels like the developer was being lazy.  It has a way of disconnecting the audience from feeling it was a realistic experience. Unfortunately, it just ends up reminding you that in fact none of this is real.

There are hard edges on a lot of the polygon models.  The planets and ships could look better with a revised method of lighting and texturing. Space is black - not dark navy blue. Everything, in general, is just too over-lit. Unity is capable of some great rendering and camera effects. There is no flaring of the lights, blooming of highlights, even some very very subtle chromatic aberration would help make the visuals feel a little more realistic. 

I have seen some amazing work done by rendering textures and environments using path tracers to pre-render global illumination to create textures that have all of the advanced lighting baked in then applying those textures to the real-time game engine models. It's low overhead and it produces great results. Ubisoft is normally really on point with the visuals on their AAA titles - I just don't know what happened here, especially given what a breakthrough experience this could have been. 

I hate to go on a nerd graphics rant - this game is something I have been looking forward to - I'm hoping there will be a game engine update or at least a way to re-skin the game in the future.

As long as you don't mind being in a cartoon version of the ST universe you will have a blast! If you want to be immersed in not just the game play but feel like your there visually this version has a bit to go...","Jun 4, 2017 at 11:00 PM",4, 7,

Make no mistake, while it can be played single player, this is very much a multiplayer game. If you play this by yourself, then it really is your loss.

I've generally been a single player kind of gamer (at least outside of gaming with real life friends), but VR is slowly but surely dragging me into playing online more and more. It's games like this that will show off how social VR gaming really is, and not the isolating technology that the nay-sayers continually tout it to be.

When your shields are down and the hull is on the verge of collapse, moments of tension, skill, ineptitude and hilarity will give you a VR gaming experience that, as of this moment, is unsurpassed.","Jun 4, 2017 at 3:57 PM",5, 1,

There probably isn't a whole lot of content in this game but it's literally the most fun I've had in a while. The random missions seem to have replayability. It's cross platform so you're playing with people on the VIVE and on PSVR. I ordered Oculus touch just because of this game. It is, however, easily playable with the XBONE controller.

2022-05-28 13:47:50.100003,BruceWright,A game that VR was made for!,"The concept is a 4-person crew, each playing in a shared vr spaceship, and each with a different job to do.. helm, tactical, engineering and captain.

This seems like a really difficult challenge, to make a satisfying game out of ""ready photon torpedoes"", or any of the other jobs of a starship. If the other guy is firing the phasers... is your job doing something different still fun and challenging?

The answer is yes!!! The game does a great job of balancing the tasks so nobody feels left out. It's INTENSELY satisfying to say ""Warp vector plotted and ready on your mark, sir.""

The fact that it's able to take technobabble from a 1960's tv show that is meant to be background chatter to story, and make it a convincing and even enjoyable set of tasks is kind of amazing.

That said, the heart of Trek is story... and this is a BIIIT more of a Tactical Simulator. You won't be talking to aliens to convince them to hold democratic elections. You WILL be launching photon torpedoes at their klingon butts and sending them back to Qo'noS with their tails between their legs.

This is an EXCELLENT social multi-player game. The ability to jump right in is fantastic, but even better with people you know. Each station is a different game, kind of, and each requires you to master different skills.

Also cool is that mistakes are costly... but a few aren't fatal, they just require everyone to think on their feet and work around the problem. It's not *oh, shoot, you forgot to raise shields in time... you're all dead!*. It's more *you forgot to raise shields in time, now your phasers are offline while repair crews are hard at work. Maybe limp off into a nebula and fix those while re-routing power to various subsystems.*

I hope they keep adding and adding new missions.","Jun 7, 2017 at 7:50 AM",5, 1,

Even the extended missions surprised me since they offer a lot of depth and replayability forcing you to really get used to the deeper systems like stealth and ship signature to sneak by enemy ships. 

The best parts of the game really all are tied to the social aspect which this game achieved in spades! I hope the game gets continual DLC support as I'd buy them.

The game is just a blast in general and even for non-Trekkies will be a mighty good time just trying to keep the ship together. For Trekkies, this is a must buy if you've ever wanted to see and feel how it is to be in a starship.

Haven't tied multi-player yet, but I'm thinking it's just going to be more of the same, just faster paced.
