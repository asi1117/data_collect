2022-05-28 20:02:18.252923,bbbrrromez,Great fun - a new take on time crisis,"This game is simple but fun, the mechanics are executed really well. The graphic are cartoonish but there is plenty of rag doll effects and attension to detail, like when you shoot a baddie their mate looks at them in horror! Music score is good too. I have just purchased the 'Mongoose' and the game gets too easy - i hope they can fix this- i think a more realistic loading mechanism would add a lot more challenge!",Dec 8 at 4:20 AM,5, 10,
2022-05-28 20:02:18.267883,BigJoDangle,I like this game,"Super fun game to play. Especially when you want a more laid back, but still exciting game to play. PATIENTLY waiting for more levels because I beat them all quite quickly. My only suggestion was, I didn't notice much of a difference from Easy to Hard on most levels. Not a deal breaker by any means however.",Dec 14 at 11:27 AM,5, 3,

I have a few sugestions such as primarys such as a M16, Spas12, M60, AK12, AA12, M4A1,M1A1, M1 Garand, Springfeild 1903, And the Browning Automatic Rifle or BAR.

2022-05-28 20:02:21.436479,Slick1984,Interesting Game,"This game is in short, intense, bursts of action.

The AI moves around to try to shoot you, so shooting blind from behind cover, works well.

Ususally, multiple places in which to jump. I usually prefer standing cover, when it's an option.

It takes multiple shots to take out an AI, unless it's a head shot. Sometimes they will run up on you. Always be ready and loaded. Lower the gun to reload.

Fun, intense, game.",Jan 4 at 5:57 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:02:21.450442,evidee,A future must have title,"For now its really too short but the game itself is really fun. Increase the difficulty more (like maybe an optional true reloading mecanic with bigger reward for using it). Add more bad guy (make them smarter) per level, some boss battles like an helicopter, make the additional life harder to get (disapear after a really short time) and of course more levels (many more), a path choice and some car chase level like virtua cop 2 , then we have a winner. for now 4 star , 5 soon i hope. Also a short story (with different ending ) behind all that shooting could be awsome.",Dec 28 at 12:44 PM,4, 0,
2022-05-28 20:02:21.465402,StreetwiseCrew,Time Crisis hits Vr,"I love a game that I can just pick up and have fun with, a simple concept but just great fun. I am a massive Time Crisis fan so anything like that is a winner for me.
Anyone can jump into this, no need to find your Vr legs, the teleport option just works well, be prepared to move and duck for cover.
Who knows where the developer can go with this but the options are limitless


An early access game and cheap enough to download and support the developer. I paid just £7.99 for the Pc version. I hope cross buy becomes active when it gets an official release.",Dec 23 at 7:21 PM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:02:21.480363,MarkoffChaney,Great Arcade Light Gun Game,"Stellar game that reminds me of peeking around the Time Crisis cabinet back in the day. It has teleport movement that allows you to choose different lotcations to taking out the bad guys and is in active development. My biggest concern at this time is that I saw that had Cross-Buy. I purchased it with this in mind, but don't seem to be able to download it from my Quest without purchasing it again from the store. I have reached out to the developers to see if they can resolve this.",Dec 20 at 5:48 PM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:02:24.599641,RatedR74,Time Crisis VR - Killer,"Honestly one of my best PCVR shooting games.  It's fast paced, re-playable, forever changing with new guns and EXTREMELY good fun. 

Developers : You've done a Stella job with this title.  More levels would be nice and a flowing story mode would be amazing like Time Crisis and Virtua Cop series.   All in all best shooter I've played on Quest 2/ PCVR",Dec 15 at 8:36 AM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:02:24.615598,WilgaWild,Fun little shooter !,"Great little fun shooter. Worked up a sweat ! Graphics are nice and crisp, sound is great and mechanics are simple enough that you can enjoy the game straight away.  I look forward to more levels being released.",Dec 9 at 5:00 PM,5, 1,
