2022-05-28 15:03:57.713352,dylanhusted,My favorite game,"Gameboard racing with arcade shooting is sooo much fun! This game is surprisingly fun. I bought it on a whim without expectations. I now play it more than all the AAA stuff out there.

Thing is... I rarely boot up the rift now that the quest 2 is out. 

I'd gladly pay again (or even double) to get this on my quest. It's perfect for that device.","Jan 7, 2021 at 11:50 AM",5, 2,

Turns out (after much frustration), it was reading my PS4 controller that was plugged in as the primary device. Pressed ""x"" on the controller and sure enough it went to the next screen. From there, I just unplugged the controller and went back to touch controls and it worked fine. Love the game! Annoying bug, hope this helps anyone with similar struggles.","Aug 15, 2019 at 2:59 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 15:04:00.932742,Satconcook,Racing Micro Machines in VR.,"I bought this game a while back after one of their free weekends because it was a lot of fun. There were several lobbies of people to play with and voice chat made it even more fun. It is like they took a post apocalyptic Mario Kart style racing and put it on Micro Machines and brought it to VR. It reminds me a lot of the old game RC Pro-AM for Nintendo. However, after that free weekend the lobbies were few and far between. If you were lucky to find one with international players, the lag was game breaking. The game is still fun, but after you get through the campaign, the only replay is with other people, if there are any online. It also seems like they made one last update and abandoned it.

Audio only works if Windows default is the RIft S and the game is on top of any other windows.","Jan 25, 2020 at 5:35 AM",4, 4,

There's something so novel and fun about playing a standard top-down racer in the Rift. The cars feel like toys. You can lean into the racetrack and weave around cars and obstacles.

2022-05-28 15:04:04.106254,PGATI,NO ADVERSARIES!,"Translation from portuguese to english! PLAISE:The game it self is great and addictive, note 10, everything in the game is great from start to finish of a match! Working with windows 10 was almot perfect! Well, I already had this game on Steam, and it was 99% of the VR games that worked with w 10 and only this specific game with windows 7, and it was horrible to have to change the operating system at every invitation from a good opponent! Now it´s almost perfect! Well, from here, I descrive the bad part of this game! Bad part about the game is the lag (dlay, slowness) when palying with people from other contries! PLAYING PART OF THIS game:YOU CAN NOT PLAY WITH THE FRIENDS of Steam that have this same game! Note:Many of the good players in this game (BlazeRush) do not have oculus VR, but they are gret opponents. And if you enter to play online (version sold on Steam) 10 times, at least 06 times, has opponents to compete. Well, as important as having a good game are the opponents to compete! With the new version (sold by Oculus) has the good part of working with the W 10, BUT, when entering to play online 10 times, 10 times there is no one to play! Morl of the story:even with an oculus CV1, I still keep changing system and making use of the DK2. My favorite game now works with W 10, BUT, without Steam´s friends to play and no other oppoents too! Well, the online game (of ocuus rift), more like a desert, we rarely find someone playing online! That is, new version to work  with Windows 10 almost perfect!","Aug 28, 2018 at 8:58 AM",1, 2,

It reminds me of old games I use to play when I was young with some friends and family. But the VR is soooo freakin coool !

I wish I could go back in time and show my friends this game. They would be blown away. The single player alone was a lot of fun with all the explosions and constant action. VR really makes this game come to life with stuff flying to your face etc. Brilliant.

You find yourself laughing constantly even when it's you that has been knocked off. The physics feel great screeching round corners, the main PvP mode keeps respawning your cars to keep the whole race interesting, and the isometric god view over the race track works brillintly in VR. Very glad I found this as it wasn't the sort of game I was expecting to be so great in VR!

It's a battle royale race to the finish line.  You get powerups if you're behind to get a leg up on the competition.  Definitely recommend playing this game on Xbox controller versus anything else so you can pinpoint drive around the tight curves.  Boost your way past enemies or blow them up.  Multiplayer is frantic and anything can happen.  The difficulty curve is actually not steep at all, once you get the hang of driving (it took me a few races to get ""it"").

Truth be told, the fact that they allowed it to be free for a couple of days lured me in.  Then they brought the price down to $4.99.  I felt with the amount I played I had to support the lower cost at a least.  The game is really worth $15.00 at least.  I would pay another $20-$30 additional for an add-on that allowed me to jump into the car first person.  That would be crazy fun.  Also, when passing the cars you would see the characters face   in sync with multiplayer movements.   Touch controllers could be used to steer the car.  Just another level to the game. WOW.  Anyway.

But after the big update with the added voice chat and the mode BlazeBowl, it really got alot better. The multiplayer is absolutely fantastic in every kind of way. The matches starts fast, all the cars have their own unique ""feel"", and all the people I've met through the game are all great, behave and laugh with and compliment each other.

The VR works perfectly for this game, and it's the only game to date where I have reached out my hand to catch a falling football or a car. I love the physics in the game. The cars have these little detail that they are always moving/bouncing, so they look really alive and at the same time toy-like. Only in a positive way.

I can only come up with one thing that can be get a little bit of critic, and it's the music. It's actually okey, but I much prefer to use the playlist of the classic SNES game Rock N' Roll Racing in the background while I play BlazeRush.

The simple immersion of it in VR adds way more than it has any right to. Explosions and debris flying towards your face, and even after countless hours playing I still expect to smell burnt rubber and oil every time it happens. The single player AI can get brutal towards the end of the single player content, but it never quite feels unfair. Overall 5/5. Should be purchased before you even install Lucky's Tale.","Nov 15, 2016 at 6:16 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:05:20.000264,karrtoon,Great game!,"A lot of fun, the mutiplayer stadium football mode and ""deathrace"" are the most fun modes. It's cool seeing these tiny cars in front of you and the gameplay is something that makes you want to keep coming back.

The only downside is a lot of times there are hardly any players on (like 3 or 4 during slow time) depending on the time of day. Weekends are better it seems. So be prepared for that before you purchase.","Nov 14, 2016 at 6:06 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:05:20.017220,KRX1,,This is the sleeper hit of the entire Oculus line up so far. It's a game you will keep coming back to again and again. Laugh out loud moments in multiplayer (do NOT miss the multiplayer!) and the devs are still adding content. DO NOT MISS THIS!,"Nov 30, 2016 at 9:04 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:05:20.034174,chbarth,Micro Machines with Mario Kart,"Great game which is like a mix of Micro Machines and Mario Kart.
Really fun and I didn't expect having so much fun. Great atmosphere in VR! Thanks for this great game!","Dec 21, 2016 at 3:21 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 15:05:20.051128,Leeringapple,Really fun,This game is the vr version of Mario Kart and it looks great. The game is surprisingly long but repetitive but doesn't stop being fun. Definitely worth the cheap price.,"Dec 15, 2016 at 2:39 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 15:05:23.164800,K.Jeffrey,Surprisingly a lot of Fun!,"Total blast of a game to play - seems so simple in 2D but in 3D (especially Death Race) it’s so much fun! I was laughing all night with a few buds as we tried to run away from that machine and its devastating grinder haha This game totally shocked me, the online servers get populated fast after playing a few rounds (if they say empty) and no, this isn’t a Rocket League clone so don’t get confused by the cover/media like I was. Happy I got it!","Nov 15, 2016 at 9:36 AM",5, 1,
