Clean graphics, fun mechanics, replayability, opportunities for improvisation, kinda ll therre.  Imagine two-player sly-cooper.  CON: sometimes the comtinue option will stall your game, and leave you and your hacker on endless load screen.  Fix: when resuming, just start the level over from the top.

Nov 2020 Update / I have had this game for months, and I still cannot get through one single level without the game crashing or stalling, or booting me out of the session.  I have contacted Oculus support and the game devs.  No response from the devs, and oculus did not have a fix.  Over it, and wishing I bought beat saber.","Nov 26, 2020 at 10:41 AM",2, 1,"Hi, sorry to hear that you are having issues.  Please email us at hello@WhiteElkStudios.com to see if we can help you out!"

The main issue is that their seems to be no mechanisim to allow people you don't know to play with you. So if your friends are not intereasted, you just can't play the game. Still It's very enjoyable and unique. I would love to see this type of game become a genre.","May 24, 2020 at 11:42 PM",4, 0,
