Simple game, Overall it'd say it's good.
One hand is a sword and the other is a trowing star.
Dodge the incoming melons by moving side to side.
Try not to attack the innocent bystanders that run across the map.
Great way to pass time and compete against friends or online leaderboard.
Second game I ranked #127 which is considerable.
My rank will probably not last long but I could definitely get a higher score with some practice.
It is multiplayer but I couldn't demo it as no one was online to go against.
It's currently on sale half off on Oculus store. $2.50 from $4.99
I would consider $2.50 a reasonable price for the content.
I wouldn't recommend it at its full price.
There is more content to it then the arcade mode I played.
