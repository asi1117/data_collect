2022-05-28 18:34:19.930064,FA1CO,Different & Fun take on FPS Wave shooter,"I have been enjoying this game quite a bit. The Setting (1890's London) is very cool, the weapons are very different and cool. There is alot of content here and I think well worth the $14.99 price tag. a definate buy!!","Jan 8, 2018 at 4:56 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 18:34:19.949013,CherryEngine,Steampunk fun!,"This is real Victorian London adventure. You can use total free movement and see scenes in details. Rich story more, arcade dynamic missions + many different type of enemies to fight with with. I recommend to use voice commands - they works great and make gameplay more cool!","Jan 8, 2018 at 9:00 PM",5, 5,
