2022-05-28 20:14:41.879635,SombraTheShiba,Best Arena Shooter. Works on Quest 2!!,"Hands down - best arena shooter on VR. If you are old enough to remember games like unreal tournament - this is it - but in VR AND OH SO GOOD! 

Rail Gun? Yeah its here, can you combo the primary and secondary fire? Of COURSE! 

Flak Cannon, Yeah, its here - but it is the shrapnel cannon. 
Rocket launcher. Yeah. Load 3 up at a time? Yeah. 

Health Packs. 
Shield Packs. 

Awesome Maps. 

I can't say enough about this game. I know they are working on an ""official"" Quest 2 port - due out in Q2 2020....But I downloaded on Oculus store on PC and played using Oculus Link - worked like a charm. 

The design is nice, cell shading style kinda like Borderlands. Bots, No Bots, Parkour Map, leaderboards, weekly leaderboards, practice ranges and private matches....This game has it all, and it is still in early access.","May 26, 2021 at 11:25 AM",5, 3,

The graphics are great the frame rates are great, the movement is great,  there’s not enough great things I could say about this game.","May 9, 2021 at 5:44 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:14:41.910553,V3TheViking,Extremly fun but very imbalanced,"This game is in early accses so imbalance of weapons is very usual in the beginning of a game. I still love this game and its fun to learn the mecanics of everything, but the weapons need to change a bit.

here is my idea to maybe balancing some weapons:

First of: the plasma lazer pistol? (the one that automaticly connecs to a target) is way to powerfull. This game should reward people for good presision and timing, this weapon goes agains all of it. Its very unfunn to fight against, and its a weapon you can have in you loadout, making it easy to wip out mid fight to finish someone off. My idea to this weapon is to not make it accsesable to you loadout and nerfing the damage, other than that i think its fine.

The bow: even though the bow is seen as the worst weapon, it can still 2 shot somebody. and is very spammable, making it a great tool as a primary in manny fights. i think it should be nerfed from being able to 2 shot to 3 shot a player.

this is just my opinion, but id like to hear some thoughts from the developer :)

other than that, great game! 5/5","Feb 13, 2021 at 5:26 AM",5, 10,"Thank you very much for your review. We have been constantly balancing the weapons based player feedback and will continue to do so.

We are designing every weapon to have pros and cons. The Laser Beamer seems OP but it is actually a skill-based weapon too because it does higher damage only if your aim is right on target. What is more it has one of the lowest damage output. The bow might be 2 shot eliminating players but it doesn't have a crosshair and you will get tired if you use it all the time.

With all that said, come, join our Discord (https://discord.gg/A4fUKDC) where we regularly ask balance questions and tweak values of the game based on the most popular suggestions."

2022-05-28 20:14:41.940472,MONSTERMINDED,why is no one playing ?,Well' This is sad. I can not get in any game at all. I played the demo and really wanted there to be players but I don't think it's right to wait never knowing if your going get in a game or not. The game is fun with bots but it gets old real fast. I have no idea why no one is playing but if I can't play online i just wasted 16 bucks. I would advise you guys to let people have access to online from the demo maybe just one map just so there is players other wise I'm just going get a refund and i don't want that...,"Mar 10, 2021 at 2:27 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:14:45.050768,wheresJeremy,Fun but not enough players,"This game is one of the best games ive played but you cant play with steam players, I recommend bying it on steam instead of oculus or else you wont find a multiplayer game.","Feb 20, 2021 at 4:05 PM",5, 6,Thank you for the feedback. The game is cross-platform with Steam so you can play together with them however there can be cases when the client can't find games: either when there are only full lobbies or the players are playing private party matches. The player base is growing each day but for now we recommend playing during the evening hours (US time) and on the weekends. On Discord (https://discord.gg/A4fUKDC) we have a ping feature so you can notify others when you'd like to play.

2022-05-28 20:14:45.095155,john.kernelle,Game Is Great,"very fun game, already in my top 5 vr games ever played
if you cannot find other players, you can play single player againtst bots, unlike Solaris, AI is also pretty good

I dont really play FPS games but this got me hooked instantly,

just wish there's a way to instantly switch your grapple from your left hand to your right hand and vice versa","Mar 25, 2021 at 7:09 PM",5, 3,
