New standalone lite version for Oculus Quest is coming soon!
I hold a PhD in VR research and I don't recommend Kids below 13 to play the Game.","Jun 9, 2021 at 7:48 AM",5, 0,

The alien robot concept is fun and the batting works really well. Especially impressive since Lionel Jayaraj developed the whole game himself. Defintely recomend the game, especially to other Cricket fans.","Apr 3, 2021 at 8:45 PM",5, 3,
