The only way you can interact with the game is by looking around as it does not support a gamepad or Touch. This does make the game feel a little unnatural compared to the rest of the Rift's game library, but at it's heart it is a decent game.","Feb 2, 2017 at 7:44 AM",4, 0,

Giving only 4stars because I think the app is way too simple for this price (even for a gearVR game).
On the other hand, it costs a price of a box of cigarettes, and this minigame provides fun for lot longer than it would take you to smoke that box of tobacco.","Feb 2, 2017 at 8:10 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 19:48:59.012895,FrozenPea,Nice little retro game,"DISCLAIMER- I was given the game for free by the dev.

Its a good use of 360, I'd recommend playing standing up so you can turn around easily or use a spinny chair. The gameplay is very simple and fun.

I'd recommend adding some sort of small prompt at the start so we know how to actually play the game. Also on the menu there is a small halloween looking icon, I can't seem to exit it with the Rift + remote. I wasn't really sure what that was all about!

It's very obviously a Gear VR mobile game port for the rift but if you like retro arcade style games but in 360 and VR then you'll like this :)","Jan 19, 2017 at 5:31 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:48:59.027855,glasgowgooner,I love cubed Review - XlordB Oculus Rift,"Disclaimer - I got this free from the developer. I played up to beating the first boss.

Visuals - nice visuals from the days of nintendo type graphics (imho). 
Gameplay - The concept is great you basically defend a block (princess) inside various points in a sphere from incoming blocks (enemies) and bombs from a boss. You do this my moving your block character by looking around the sphere. If you die you get to upgrade either damage or the princess health. you can continue from where you died.

The performance is fine on my Gtx 970.

So why four stars and not five?
The story is a nice touch its a lot like the days of mario etc.
The gameplay is actually good however moving your head to move the block is a little bit extreme. I say this because you are working from inside a sphere and the boss battle tended to have the boss at the opposite side of the sphere from the princess. This sort of makes it difficult when spinning around (a lot) while your tethered to the rift headset. Touch controls would greatly enhance this aspect of the game.

Optionally It could have more of a 180 degree circle rather than a sphere to save peoples necks.

Apart from this the game is really good and with a bit more development could be the first mario esque (reverse - asteroid) type game to reside on the store.

Final verdict 4/5 mainly due to controls. Easily fixed so well done to bigimmersive. Looking forward to seeing their future titles.","Jan 17, 2017 at 8:33 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 19:49:02.147152,kgian76,Polished little game,It is a polished little game. You move your guy or girl with your head and try to knock the enemies. There is a simple story and a nice artistic touch. A bit repetittive though.,"Jan 21, 2017 at 6:55 AM",4, 0,
