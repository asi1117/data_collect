2022-05-28 19:20:53.477325,DJHeroMasta,I Just Use It As A Benchmarking Tool.,"It's a high quality scene that's being rendered in real time. One day, when have HMD's with a high enough resolution and the hardware to properly drive them, these graphics will be the forefront.","Jan 14, 2019 at 8:10 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 19:20:53.492285,VirtuaLieven,Duh?,"A photo would also do it.  Don't expect anything, it's really just about ten seconds of watching a very high quality designed person with no interaction. It's worth a look, yes, but once you seen it, you can delete it again because... well... yeah - why keep it?","May 7, 2018 at 3:20 AM",3, 6,

2022-05-28 19:20:56.673775,uKER,A truly beautiful scene,"My only gripe with it is that the tear that she sheds appears to be black, instead of just a more reflective area in her skin.
Other than that, the character is just captivating.","Jan 19, 2018 at 2:38 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:20:56.689733,HeyJesseAe,Average,"A good demo that shows the quality of NPCs you can expect from some titles. Very brief video of a well made model. Visually appealing, simply a demo.","Jan 21, 2018 at 11:03 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 19:20:56.704693,richmondjw78,WOW,"Incredible detail, and emotion conveyed in the character.  She's beautiful. The energy, realism and subsequent sense of connection is amazing. Superb job people, if this is where, the focus, is upon this development, I am sure it will be amazing, ground-breaking, game-changing and all those superlatives. Sensational job so far on your characters. Superb.","Dec 2, 2017 at 10:37 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 19:20:59.828338,blazinsriftgames,Short but sweet.,"It's 1 minute long, but the model herself is truly beautiful and gives you an overwhelming sense of love. Well atleast with me, i would suggest you try it for yourselves, but its really a unique and beautiful creation.

I would like to think she really exists.. my mind is telling me its just a model but my heart is telling me otherwise. lol","Nov 7, 2017 at 12:51 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:20:59.842301,OJustinO,"Short, but sweet.",They are playing on the fact that I am of the opposite sex. If it was anything other then a pretty girl I think people wouldn't be rating this so high. If you like pretty girls you should have a look.,"Dec 16, 2017 at 3:26 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 19:20:59.857261,NeilChil,Awful,"Seriously dont know what everyone is talking about, its just terrible music and tacky clouds then some asian woman stands in front of you. The whole thing last 1 minute...not worth the storage space.","Nov 12, 2017 at 4:48 PM",1, 4,

2022-05-28 19:21:02.979910,tonyfromsyracuse,the first steps to having custom women,"Simply amazing. you really do see the possibilities with creating realistic looking humans. and this is just the baby steps. someday, they will perfect interaction with these virtual women if you know what I mean, and if you think games will be big sellers...you havent seen anything yet. these developers ..I'm not sure if they understand the power of the notion someday you could have women anytime you want...custom made...and someday with AI personalities, to do with as you want. the day they perfect this..will be the day every guy calls in sick to work. its ALL about women. thats what fuels pretty much every guy. tap into that, and you will be billionaires.","Nov 7, 2017 at 11:12 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:21:02.994869,innovacy,Short but astounding,"This is truely short, but it's so astounding, that I had to replay this one minute it lasts, several times. It's so nicely designed, beautiful, very detailed. The animations very real life like, not just of the girl, but also of her clothing how every part of it waves in the air. I can imagine immediately a personality behind the girl in it. You almost feel a connection, that she may have to you and you to her.  Amazing detail, beautifully made and simply wow. I would buy the game, based on this, right away, if all in it were so beautifully done. Even without knowing what the game is about! I'm sold by just this short intro! ;)","Nov 2, 2017 at 6:07 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 19:21:06.103555,thekthepthe3,Impressive but short,"A very impressive experience graphically but very short. The intro and credits are almost as long as the actual content.

That being said its free and if, like me, you just got your headset and you're downloading all of the content to try out, this one is well worth a look.","Nov 5, 2017 at 4:13 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 19:21:06.119512,rooitou,Beautiful,"I can only imagine how much work must have gone into creating an almost life-like image of that young woman. It is beatiful, but very short and nothing to do. Hope this develops into something with more substance. But then we'll have to pay.","Nov 8, 2017 at 9:52 PM",4, 0,
