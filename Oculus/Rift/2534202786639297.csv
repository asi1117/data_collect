2022-05-28 20:46:43.810020,RowdoggNZ,Great VR Flying Game,"Very good experience, only played a few hours so far but seems to be a fair bit of content so I don't think it will get boring too quickly. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a flight enthusiast or likes VR flight sims with VR Touch flight controls that do not require you to have a HOTAS setup. 

Only other game I have played with similar control scheme is VTOL VR... this has a far more arcady sort of feel albeit definitely with some combat I found!  The flight controls and how the flying feels in the first 2 planes you unlock is a fantastic experience.

I can't wait to see what else this game throws at me as I play more.",Apr 23 at 8:58 PM,5, 12,
2022-05-28 20:46:43.823983,JonnyJamesC,Great Flight,Defintely a big step up from the excellent Quest 2 version. The game just feels bigger and chunkier on PC with superb visuals but not so much that you will never play the Quest 2 version again. Two excellent versions and a great upgrade over the original game.,Apr 22 at 4:10 AM,5, 15,
2022-05-28 20:46:43.839940,Thynebrother86,"Amazing game, game breaking bug though","While I LOVE everything about this game, so much content and great optimization. Unfortunately I have personally encountered a bug that doesn'tet me perform the essential functions to take off. Specifically the actions where you have to extend a finger to flip a switch. Aside from that bug, great game devs!

Once this is working for me again, it will be a 5 star review for me!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update, the game is now a 5 star review for me! Thank you for getting back to my comment so quickly devs, it fixed the problem right away. Its unfortunate that oculus had created the issue, but atleast there was a work around for it. Again, thank you for the quick response.",13 days ago,5, 0,"*sigh*

Oculus broke capacitive touch in the latest version of the their beta drivers.

Revert to previous version by going into the Beta tab and unchecking Public Test Channel in Oculus Home.   This is will revert to the previous drivers. 

This is Oculus' fault not ours."
2022-05-28 20:46:43.853903,Freddynz,Great as expected !,"Loved the Quest version but held off playing it to wait and see how much better this version is. That was the right choice.... its the same game but its the little things that really add up, esp lighting !  Am finding the 1st lvls easier than b4 which is nice as it's a very challenging game, also.... get a fan on your face as you fly, makes a heap of difference with motion sickness !
  It is a pity there doesnt seem to be cross platform progress, sometimes you just want to play the quest version (you're away from PC) but don't want to go back to the beginning !",Apr 26 at 5:54 PM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:46:43.868863,GreenTeaCB,Broken controls fixed,"Updating my review, my original problem that made the game unplayable;

""I can adjust knobs that require rotating them, like the gas, but I cannot flick the magneto on. Maybe there is something I am missing, I've spent time trying to figure it out but there just doesn't seem to be any other ways to do it and at this point I'm left thinking this is just some bug that affects my setup for one reason or another""

The dev's response did completely fix the problem, the problem was with the Oculus software, not the game itself.

So now that I've been able to play the game it is incredibly good. It's that balance between sim and arcade fun, not too simple that you lose interest but also not too complicated that you have to spend hours learning to fly. Absolutely worth playing.",21 days ago,5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:46:46.983532,ApocalypticKFC,An amazing game from an amazing Team...,"Firstly I would like to say wow just WOW!!!! what a visual improvement over the quest version. 
It's the little details in the lighting, shadows and textures that do it for me. The experience just seems so much more immersive / intense.

Gameplay is well thought out and balanced with a ton of replayability. 
Its like a Flight simulator had a baby with Angry birds I love it.
There is so much room for expansion e.g. new islands, planes and game modes that I would happily pay for as DLC.

I did have a rare bug during my first day of play that spawned me at random places on the map. The studio director spent the evening helping me and a patch fix was released in less than 24 hours!!!.
Thank you Chris Stockman and your team. 
You are all legends I have never received such amazing customer service in my life.",Apr 29 at 5:41 AM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:46:46.998492,iirunningmanii,Very fun casual flight simulator,I enjoyed the first and the sequel is even better with the new planes and helicopter which makes it more fun with many diverse missions to challenge the best pilots.,10 days ago,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:46:47.013452,Quest787,Surprising,"The Quest version is good. But this looks better and, more importantly, feels better to play. More premium. More solid. A big enough step up to play through the campaign again.",Apr 23 at 7:05 PM,5, 1,
