2022-05-28 20:31:06.849378,DarkSol91,Brilliant for a good scare,"this game hits the nail on the head for jump scares, I have only played in vr so far but my wife and friends seemed to have an extremely good time scaring me haha . i had one issue where they could only see a quarter of the screen but upping the picture quality seemed to have fixed that and they could see exactly what i could see. so anyone with this issue i suggest trying that and if it works then please write a good review. i would love to see an update with some extra levels. the people that have worked on this game have done an amazing job... well done!!!","May 29, 2020 at 5:36 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 20:31:06.863340,hoochilee,,"Spooking the person in game and watching friends freak out is pretty satisfying. it's a really good game to have at a get together and you can even play together on streams regardless of where you are. If you're looking for a scary game to scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of your friends and then laugh at them, look no further.","Apr 4, 2020 at 1:32 AM",5, 22,
2022-05-28 20:31:06.878300,omwASAP,Great game! One major bug.,"The game was great to play with friends! Unfortunately there's a bug that prevents the Non-VR friends in the room to only see a quarter of what the VR friend is seeing. Specifically the top left corner. 
While friends were walking through corridors and hallways, we'd only see the top left. Not necessairly game breaking, but still a pain.","May 24, 2020 at 2:22 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 20:31:06.893260,DreamerO,HELL YEAH,This game hits all the right buttons for fear and craziness--but the multipayer capabiity for people at home to join in and spook you puts it over the top!,"Apr 9, 2020 at 10:14 AM",5, 11,
