2022-05-28 19:29:28.379147,maxwell.bloeser,Great,"Fantastic, especially for being made by one person. It was perfect because the game was not only scary but it also told a story. Good if you want a free horror game.","Jan 25, 2021 at 8:18 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:29:28.394107,DelapierceD,Live a Maori Folktale,"Fun to be in an outwit-the-dragon faerytale, and learn about Maori lore as you go

My two critiques:
The first maybe ten minutes are set, so to play through for other endings you have to go through that first bit. I would offer skip options

Also: Not a fan of making cops protagonists. And the Maori community has some tension with them as well. But it seems to be set in a more Maori-honoring scifi future, so...","Dec 10, 2020 at 2:19 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 19:29:28.424026,FastLawyer,Hey it's free at least,"This is free, and a passion project, so you should temper your expectations.  It's a nice narrative, cinematic experience in VR.  The visuals are just okay, if a bit outdated for 2018 VR.  I think there is a nice, if brief, story here.  You certainly learn a little about Maori mythology.  And of course, it has jump scares.  I think I enjoyed the store page video of watching people's reaction more than the actual game.  This experience is a mix of using touch controllers with gaze to look operation.  I do recommend this title for VR enthusiasts, but it's nothing I would playthrough a second time nor would I show this off to friends or family.  It's fun for what it was, a nice little short VR experience.  But it wasn't fun enough that I would try for the different endings.","Jan 17, 2018 at 1:41 PM",3, 5,Thanks Superattorney for the critical response. Will take this feedback and hopefully improve with my next project!
2022-05-28 19:29:31.561635,Jezza3D,Amazing peice of work,"Considering this was created by one person it is quite an achievement.
There are a few easy things that I would suggest to improve it. Find a friend who does voice acting, this is atleast 50% of the perceived quality of any film.
Follow the Oculus VR best practices guidelines for simple ways to improve the VR experience.    https://developer.oculus.com/design/latest/concepts/book-bp/

Thanks for sharing for free.  Definately worth a play","Jan 18, 2018 at 4:53 AM",4, 2,"Thank you for the kind words Jezza3D! Unfortunately, I don't have many friends who are voice actors! Thank you for playing!"
2022-05-28 19:29:31.576595,demotricus,Baffling.,"Seemed very slow and the controls a bit sluggish and unresponsive, I`m still trying to work out what I did as the game seemed to do its own thing apart from the multiple choice answers and it played through like a movie.  I achieved ""ending 3"" apparently and a bravery award and coma for my partcicipation, but I`m still confused... oh well.","Jan 27, 2018 at 7:39 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:29:31.591555,nightcat.mau,Amazing!,Your choices really do make a difference. Beautiful graphics and excellent atmosphere. It's like getting to play a choose your own adventure book in VR. Very good use of the limited flashlight and player choices.,"Jan 17, 2018 at 11:51 AM",5, 3,Thank you nightcat.mau for the kind words! I am glad you enjoyed it!

2022-05-28 19:29:31.621474,PixelTrips,,"Nor bad for a 15 minute narrative.  First play through I got the second ending.  As others have said the graphics are dark, and you do not contol locomotion.  I seemed to always be at least a foot above the floor.","Jan 21, 2018 at 8:38 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 19:29:34.748112,Parallaxed,Nice Atmospheres-But Choose Wisely,An interesting story driven experience.  Choose incorrectly and suffer the consequences.  Certainly worth a try although the dark visuals tend to obscure detail in the Rift.,"Jan 17, 2018 at 12:33 PM",4, 2,Thanks Parallaxed for the feedback! Will use it and improve the next project!
2022-05-28 19:29:34.763072,Funkygamer78,,"Using gamepad, right trigger did nothing for me. Game started I was at a desk and felt like i was 2 feet tall... could barely see over desk","Jan 18, 2018 at 6:24 AM",2, 1,"I am sorry for the inconvenience Funkygamer78, I just tested this and the gamepad worked fine for me? In terms of height, you should be well above the desk. My only solution would be to increase your Oculus height in the settings, it may fix the issue. 
Sorry again for the problem."
2022-05-28 19:29:34.778032,DerWolf123,fun but terrifying.,Very well done but since I don't do horror very often I won't be playing this for a while.,"Jan 26, 2018 at 6:25 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:29:34.793989,Jaaq,Nice story driven game,"Especially for a free game this is a very nice story driven experience. It's great to see one of the lesser known (out side of NZ I'd guess!) creatures making its way into VR. Made me jump at one point. I thought the voice acting was fine.  Only thing was I seemed too tall, kept having to duck to allow it to let me pass through caves and such like (although that kind of added to the experience I guess) and was floating way above the bed. Was kind of alarming to see my head was apparently detached from my body. No wonder I was in hospital! (j/k).  Anyway, keep up the good work, I liked the game.","Mar 16, 2018 at 4:30 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:29:34.808949,becklarae,Oh my,"Wow this is a must game, I jumped I don't know how many times. Wow!!!!","Jan 17, 2018 at 9:15 AM",5, 1,Thanks becklarae for the kind words! Made my day!
2022-05-28 19:29:37.883726,hamzah.ali.18,Great Atmosphere and Storytelling!,"A very nice job of creating atmosphere with the environments and sound design. I felt a lot of moments of tension and anticipation which really helped with my immersion! 

The story is also dynamic, with multiple endings which are different to each other. 

The riddle section was by far my favourite moment from the gameplay, I spent a very long time thinking about which answer it could be, which was nice. 

Impressive work from a solo developer, would reccomend giving this a shot.","Jan 25, 2018 at 9:40 AM",5, 2,
