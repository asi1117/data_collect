2022-05-28 20:38:19.075006,skateninja,work in progress ?,A good concept and an interesting description of the game which is why I bought it.  But this is no where good enough to sell at this price.  Would love the developers to finish this as it has potential to be a useful self-defence tool.  Any news on an updated version ?,"Apr 29, 2020 at 7:01 PM",2, 5,

2022-05-28 20:38:19.103928,shashkes,Loved it,"I loved the physical module the most as someone with martial arts training it was very cool to see the my left hand is slower and weaker (i knew it but was cool to see the numbers).
Also enjoyed shouting at the opponents! make sure your microphone is working for that part!","Mar 13, 2020 at 7:58 AM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 20:38:19.118888,matthewh913,Awesome!,"I love how this app demonstrates and empowers you to practice so many different aspects of self defense. I found the module on setting boundaries verbally and physically great practice, and a very healthy exercise that I think can benefit me in my life.  Its very easy and natural to freeze in these intense moments, but EmpowHer helps you to train yourself to react with confidence in these situations. I found the exercises to be very practical and applicable in these fight flight or freeze situations. You don't need to become a martial arts master to learn skills and gain confidence and safety in your life with this app!","Mar 19, 2020 at 3:39 PM",5, 8,
