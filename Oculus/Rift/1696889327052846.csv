2022-05-28 19:42:14.862552,PsyberBill,Still in waiting of a great idea.,I gave this a try because this is an important subject context. however the app is not quite there yet. there are many bug fixes that need to happen before anyone can use this app. i really would like to use this app however it is just not useable yet.,"Jun 5, 2020 at 1:57 AM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 19:42:14.878509,KikiTay,Just a little Encouragement..,"Reading all the negative reviews from people grilling at the developer and reading the developer's response I can tell that the developer had good intentions at heart. Although it's a little distance away from being perfect, I hope you'll continue to work on it cos you'll never know one day your app might save a life. We definitely need an app like this, and what better environment to learn it than in VR? for better or worse it serves as an awareness. I had to perform CPR on my dad with no experience but just a voice instructions from over a mobile phone line. I sustained him just long enough for the ambulance to arrive but unfortunately lost him at the hospital. The feeling of helplessness and regrets for not learning a life-saving skill is something I'll remember for the rest of my life. Should I had the opportunity, even if it's just an experience from a ""game"" would had given me the little confidence I needed and perhaps a slightly lesser sense of guilt that I had to live with for the rest of my life. Please, I hope you don't feel discouraged or give up because of the bad reviews. I hope to see th full app being developed and more people downloading it as an experience that one day might be put into use. You have my full support and I'll be behind you, cheering you on!","May 2, 2018 at 10:23 PM",5, 11,"KiKiTay i just wanted to say thank you for this. seriously thank you. i was about to give up on this concept until i read your reply. i hope your father is ok and that same situation is all too common. you're the best, thank you for the positivity"
2022-05-28 19:42:14.894466,DAN_di_WARhol,,"I teach CPR and advanced life support. It is harmful to frighten people away from doing this because they ""won't be doing it right"". In the real world nobody ever ""does it right"", and it doesn't matter whether it's 30:2 or 15:1 or whatever combination pops into people's minds when their adrenaline is going. 

The important thing is actually that all of this does not matter. Just do what you can and compressions and breaths will help towards saving lives whether done correctly or not.

If this program helps confidence, then it is saving lives. The negative reviews here are frightening people, and are RISKING lives.","May 21, 2018 at 4:04 PM",5, 13,"hey dan,

thank you for understanding that this is more important than gameplay, negative reviews, etc. you put it best, there are lives at stake and all im trying to do is spread a little knowledge through an interactive experience. thanks again for this observation about real life situations, and how any practice at all will help your chances at saving the person.  thanks again

2022-05-28 19:42:14.909427,neuro27,Bad App,"First of all, there is no Touch support. They do have Leap Motion support for the five people who have that. Instead you use the space bar on the keyboard to simulate compressions, which amounts to spamming it as fast as possible when it tells you to. The app does not even teach the basics of Basic Life Support. When you first approach someone, you're supposed to check to see if the scene is safe, then to check for a pulse. This app will never be used to teach chest compressions, simply because a simple YouTube video already goes way further towards teaching than this bare-bones application.","Feb 5, 2018 at 12:29 PM",1, 10,"""When you first approach someone, you're supposed to check to see if the scene is safe, then to check for a pulse. ""

this is great feedback, thank you. i will incorporate this into the next version. i didnt think this app would get any attention i was just kind of playing with LeapMotion integrations. if there's any additional feedback please let me know"
2022-05-28 19:42:18.018680,Killmaster,CPR is dangerous if taught wrong,"I understand this is a just something very basic and not a full product. taking this into account. It is not something you can release a beta version on - right now anyone following this example in reallife would end-up killing the person not helping.  Even with good intention if CPR is taught wrong you risk your self and the patient.

I am certified with the Red Cross and I have performed CPR on mutliple ocassions including my own mother.  
1st of you wouldn't perform CPR like this in the hospital not the ""first aid type"" that you wanting to attempt teach. Plus the method and everything changes year after year that unless you keep up todate this will be out of date with in the 1st 30 days of realize it just isn't practical.

Such as the number of compressions, to how many breaths have change, when you are suppose to call help has changed. 

It used to be 2 breaths for every 15 compressions, now that is wrong. Fact is any CPR regardless of how out of date it is, is better than non. Which I know contridicts what I originally said - The difference is this simulation is teaching people the wrong way.

1st of all you approach - the scene, access  Danger -  If clear proceed,
2nd. You check for a response -  shaking of the shoulders.
3rd You check for breathing by place your cheek over their mouths and watching their chest, their breathing could be shallow enough you will just hear/feel it but not see the chest rising by much. 
4th, you check for any internal bleeding or external wounds (there is hidden pockets or areas the first aider checks , you also check for a pulse on the side of the neck.
5th.  -If you are on your own and no one heard your shouts go call for ambulance. otherwise proceed.  - IF there is no pulse n no breathing you have 3 minutes before brain death occurs.
6th. You tip the head back slightly by placing 2 fingers under the chin and push back, open the mouth make sure nothing is obstructing the air-way.  if you can get it out.   Soo much more !","Mar 23, 2018 at 6:06 PM",1, 2,"Hi Killmaster,

Thanks for the feedback it is very valuable. Especially thank you for detailing the steps required for a successful CPR experience. I really appreciate the listed out steps and am currently working to improve Version 2 based on people's feedback. Thanks again and keep the feedback coming! (Still need step 7 - ...)

2022-05-28 19:42:18.034145,FknNuts,CPR desaster,It simply did not work.  Too bad I was looking forward to learning something useful through this app. I hope they fix it,"Feb 2, 2018 at 1:19 PM",1, 1,"hey man sorry about that. still working out the kinks, version 1 is never pretty. if you have any feedback that can help out gladly appreciated."
