It starts in a lobby with several rooms leading off and interconnected. It is fun to get up close to the paintings in VR. When the field of view is taken over by the paintings it almost looks like I am in the painting since the images are so high resolution. One thing that wasn’t very clear was that for some paintings you have to teleport right next to them for them to appear. There are brackets on the wall indicating where the paintings are before they load in. I think it would be better to have low resolution previews of the paintings. I really like the idea of this VR Museum. It is still Early Access and I look forward to updates.","Sep 16, 2020 at 4:51 AM",5, 8,
