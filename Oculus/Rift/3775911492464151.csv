I have a rift and my best friend has a Quest 2 and we play a lot of games cross platforms but cannot seem to work out if it will be possible with this game.  Can anyone help with this???",Nov 5 at 7:47 PM,4, 17,Multiplayer between Rift and Quest 2 runs smoothly on a cross-platform basis. Have fun playing with your friends.

WHICH IS STUPID . PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD WAY OF MAKING IT A STRATEGY NOT VSING BOTS!!!!!!!!",Oct 30 at 9:25 AM,1, 18,"First of all, we are sorry to change the single-player bowling and basketball games to a 5-level AI match without notice.
In the meantime, through Steam and App Lab, we have been constantly receiving feedback from users, and there have been many requests to make single-player match with AI like other sports.
However, I overlooked the idea that a single player capable of managing personal records like yours.
To be honest, I'm sorry to tell you that it will be difficult to restore it to the original state as quickly as you want due to the recent update.
Instead, we will add a training mode that allows single-player in a short time.
Please understand this situation with an open mind. Thank you."
