2022-05-28 20:00:11.294082,TheEarquake,"Very orange, very cute, very good",A fun little game with lots of nice ideas that challenge your three dimensional puzzle solving but remains accesable enough to be fun.  A good sense of humour to it too.  This has a feel of the early days of gaming in the 80s when lots of games were made by smart young folk in their bedrooms making uniquely daft and enjoyable games.  Not enough games have this kind of personality.  Well worth the time mucking about with it.,Apr 1 at 5:42 AM,5, 1,"Thanks for your kind words.

Daft sums it up pretty well actually! Although it wasn't built in a bedroom - it was made in an office converted from a... bedroom"

Just download it you won't regret it.,Apr 19 at 12:56 AM,5, 0,"Check the little monitor in the credits room for the story of how it's free, if you like. Or TL:DR, it's part of my recovery from brain cancer.

Thanks for the lovely review, much appreciated!"
