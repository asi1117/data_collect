2022-05-28 20:28:42.095354,MattSamiA,Umm what? Excellent but like 7 mins long,"Barely even makes sense. Was awesome to watch maybe 3 action scenes for 5 seconds and a bunch of talking for the remaining 6.9 mins..... Am i missing something here? or just a emo I paid money for that I will be asking to refund?
So much potential, so little anything :( 3 stars for the quality only.
Make a full movie of it and i will pay $30 to watch.","Feb 18, 2020 at 9:05 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 20:28:42.110314,grekb,Fun and interesting,"Thing you should know before you buy:
-Its a 10 minute short movie
-Its 360 + 3D video (its not a flat like youtube 360 videos, it has depth, but its not VR, you cant walk into space)
-Quality of the video is ok, but could be better
To be honest i really liked it! It has some really cool action scenes, bullet times and other fun stuff in it short length. I didnt like the position in 3D space of some of the actors, i thought they were out of place (could have done a better job there). I highly recommend it though, its a cool experience and i hope there is more to come!","Dec 26, 2019 at 3:36 AM",5, 12,"Hello grekb,

We are very happy to hear that you had fun and enjoyed the film!"
2022-05-28 20:28:42.125275,Red_Go,Nothing good,"I'm a big fan of Movies and VR. So whenever I find VR contents in movie format, I buy and watch them without hesitation.  But every single time.... it's so disappointing.  Agent Emerson was one of the worst.  

The ratio of VR image is wrong that I feel like I'm a giant.  Focus is wrong that most of the image is too blur.  The resolution is wrong that it feels like watching an old VHS tape.  Acting is wrong that the extras don't even know how to hold a rifle.  As a VR movie, the only things it can be better than a game content were those mentioned above.  So basically it did nothing good.  

I think I can still request a refund since it's been less than 10 minutes even after watching the whole movie.  But I won't, just to leave this comment. Makers of this movie! Please play a lot more VR games to see how much VR contents evolved now days before you make next one. Please!","Jan 22, 2020 at 9:15 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 20:28:42.141231,rjnmd70,I liked what I saw but way too short,"So here's the thing at the title screen there an option there that takes you into chapters. Is this whole thing just chapter 1. I want to say there 10 Chapters in there and there is no way I ran through 10 chapters unless there are diffferent branches in the story I didnt see. Without giving anything away it basically consisted of the parachute, the elevator, the katana scene, and out on the patio. Am I missing something?","Dec 31, 2019 at 9:18 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 20:28:42.156191,toddeklof,Outstanding!,Turns out my audio drivers weren't completely up to date when I fisrt purchased this. Make sure yours are because you don't want to miss out on this action packed emersive story! It really takes advantage of the best VR has to offer when it comes to storytelling. I can't wait for more!,"Jan 18, 2020 at 9:22 AM",5, 2,"Hello toddeklof,

So sorry to hear about the technical issue you've encountered. 
1) Please go to ""Devices"", select your VR Headset and make sure that in your sound output ""Use Windows Settings"" is selected. 
2) Select your desired audio playback device in Windows settings.
3) Restart the application.

That should resolve your issue, but if it doesn't please contact our support email and we'll be happy to help you further."

We're glad you enjoyed the experience!"
2022-05-28 20:28:45.308311,Angelina Starr,"Too short, Amateur Fight Scene",I see promise here but clearly the tech is a long way off.  And the fight scene was pretty lame.,"Dec 29, 2019 at 12:55 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 20:28:45.323776,Marcolia,Immersive!,"The story is interesting, the action is very immersive and very cool - it is fun movie experience where you are the main character. 

Haven’t seen anything quite like this.","Dec 25, 2019 at 1:31 AM",5, 5,"Hello Marcolia,

We are happy to hear that you found yourself immersed!"
