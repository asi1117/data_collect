2022-05-28 19:55:36.854450,Lalle75,Feels very good,"A nice and uncomplicated setting for killing monsters. The only problem I have is that I constantly press the Oculus menu button during fights. When hacking through the hordes I often touch the button, and then the game is over.

I don't know if it's a problem with my technique or these kind of games in general. You do not really fight the enemies, but waving your hands in the air. And when doing this waving movement, my thumb hits the button.","Jul 3, 2020 at 9:41 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:55:36.870408,SirCodes,Lots of Potential Here,"*** If you like Nazi Zombies and exotic weapons, BUY THIS GAME!!! ***
This game is still very much an early access experience; however, it has the potential to be something very awesome. The core of the game feels like a Call of Duty Zombies experience, but the atmosphere, enemies, and unique exotic weapons make it stand out from the typical repetitive gun-shooting experience that so many other VR games have. There is truly no other VR game like this on the market. I am really looking forward to seeing this game improve.","Apr 23, 2019 at 6:09 AM",5, 7,"Thank you for all the encouraging feedback, it really means a lot to us. We’re sorry for the late response, but rest assured we’re still busy at work on “Hollow Remnant”. I’d just like to say that the experience you described while playing perfectly encapsulates everything we wanted to translate into our game. We plan on doing another big update in the near future, to briefly summarize, the update will include a tutorial, new weapons and abilities, updated player hands, plus making the rest of the map accessible. Some polish and bug fixes will also come during that time. Figured I’d also mention we’re in the process of making the game cross platform ready. If you’d be interested in hearing more then please check out our public Discord and Facebook page. Links to both are in our description, we hope to see you there!"

The weapon models and such must've been updated since they did that video as they look way better then the stuff shown. The weapon handling is this game is really solid too, bow handling especially is some of the best i've seen in any vr game thus far. Overall i got a real call of duty zombies feel to this game more over then any other vr game i've played so far with wave based mechanics, which is a big selling point for me since that's always been one of my favorite game modes.","Feb 18, 2019 at 12:22 PM",5, 5,"Thank you for the encouraging feedback, we're glad to hear that you're enjoying the experience. In regards to the trailer it was indeed outdated at the time, it's since been updated, and will be updated from time to time while remaining in early access.
