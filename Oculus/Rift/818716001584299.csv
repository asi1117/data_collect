2022-05-28 14:17:08.342974,Pandacatgamer,Amazing!,"I dont know what epople are saying about it being really complicated. It only might take a couple of minutes to understand. It's an amazing game, I play it everyday with my family. If you dont understand something, just look up a tutorial on how to do the module.","Jun 13, 2020 at 4:11 AM",5, 17,
2022-05-28 14:17:08.357441,Comrade_Ivan,Really conflicted about this game,"On one hand, this game has great potential. Being locked in a room with a ticking bomb, and nothing but friends to help you out is a great recipe for a ton of fun when you have a bunch of people and only one VR headset.
On the other hand, figuring out how to play the game, especially when you're surrounded by friends who are new to the experience, is exasperating.
I played this game with 4 separate groups of friends, and after getting continuously blown up, they all eventually interrupted the experience on the objection that it's just too complicated.
I tend to agree - there should be an easily-accessible wizard guiding a player through a decision of how many modules (and which) they're going to play. That way, as an experienced game owner you can assess which module(s) from the manual to give to your visiting friends and set the game up for a possibility of success.","Jan 6, 2020 at 2:38 AM",2, 27,
2022-05-28 14:17:08.373398,Spectre-One,Great Party Game,Lots of fun for both the bomb defuser and experts trying to talk them through the process. As the defuser youre talking to your experts '60 seconds no rush' and as the experts your flipping through the bomb defuse manual trying to find the right page. Highly recommend.,"Oct 18, 2019 at 9:18 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 14:17:08.387361,NinJackRobot,Great game but....,"I love this game! It has great elements where both the bomb defuser and the expert always have fun! However A online multiplayer addition to this game would be a five star kind of game! This would be helpful only because sometimes you don't have a second player to play with and I think playing with random people could give even more hilarious results! Thanks, and I love your game!","May 14, 2019 at 5:27 AM",4, 47,

2022-05-28 14:17:11.560487,Kappa_Chino,One of the true staples of VR,"This game, in its simplicity, stands on top of the VR mountain. 'Keep Talking' is a standout for any occasion. It's fun with two people and it's fun with ten people taking turns. After playing this in VR, you almost forget it was originally a pancake game. With it coming to Quest, it will be even more accessible and easier to get into. With the ability to bring it to a friend's house, I really believe 'Keep Talking' will sell its share of Quests.

This is one of the best games available on the VR platform. If you're on the fence, just do it!","May 20, 2019 at 11:30 PM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 14:17:11.589410,taquitobuddy,"Fun in small amounts, great party game","This is one of the only VR games that can be played with a non-VR person, and is a great party game.  I gave it a bonus star for those alone.  Unfortunately while the VR implementation is fine, VR doesn't really add much to this experience compared to flat play.  Another way to phrase it would be to say it is a great game, but not a great game for VR.  That said, excellent game to play at parties or try from time to time, but my wife and I found it isn't a good game to play nightly or for long stretches as it quickly stops being fun.  So basically, 3-star game but gave it a bonus star for being one of the only good asymetrical VR party games available.","May 10, 2019 at 10:07 AM",4, 1,

I sent an email to the developers, asking if i need to pay tiwce to get it for oculus GO, they answer with a LIE ""While we wish this wasn't the case, I'm afraid that because the two stores exist separately, cross-buy is not supported between Rift and Go. Purchases are non-transferable.""  
I answer they can send a code to get it on GO, then they answer they do not do that... so the ""While we wish"" and the are two different stores is a lie, i prefer a simple, ""Sorry, you need to pay for each pataform"" than an stupid lie like yes we wish we can do taht but...
So too gready and lies.","Jul 25, 2018 at 8:24 AM",1, 7,"Hi David. The support email we have listed publicly is correct: support@keeptalkinggame.com. But it looks like we missed your email. Apologies! We've sent you a reply.

We ended up spending over two hours just on this! It's a lot of fun, a very simple and seemingly repetitive gameplay, but the panic of looking through the defusal manual while a ticking clock quietly (and then loudly) reminds your friend that they're going to explode in the very near future, is exhilerating.","Jul 22, 2018 at 2:06 AM",5, 12,

And you don't even have to be at the same house because of the website!! One downside is that you have to have someone else to play, it isn't single player. The biggest downside is the price, i think that this game is very fun but it is a bit expensive in my opinion.

The one and only downfall is that it DOES REQUIRE you to have at least one other person to play with.  Therefore, do not expect to be playing this game by yourself.  This is clearly made in the description of the game, so don't be disappointed and knock it after you bought like I have read from some of the other reviews.","Jan 15, 2018 at 3:36 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 14:17:24.220168,Jawwwshh,Best game ive ever bought,"This game is just simply fantastic. The only real downside is trying to find someone who wants to play it with you at the same time but aslong as you take turns you can be assured they wont be leaving anytime soon once you get going.
The manuals are so simple to understand but yeah technical and confusing enough that missing a minor detail could end in disaster which makes it all the more exciting. 
Playing this with a sense of urgency and panic while you try and describe what you see to your friends and family and they try to help you out is just classic. So many funny and stupid arguments come out of it but its worth every penny.","Jan 4, 2018 at 7:54 AM",5, 4,

It could simply be a toggle which allows you to see a copy of the manual in-game (and disables high-scores and such, obviously).  I know I'm being picky, but unless you have at least a couple other people to play with, who also want to play this game, it sits in your library untouched.","Nov 23, 2017 at 2:35 AM",4, 7,

The puzzles are challenging, as they should be, because it creates fun tension trying to figure things out before you explode. The fact it's a two player game makes it fun to take turns and have a different role to play so just adds more to the whole experience.

Although if you have experts that have read and understood the whole manual, it gets quite a lot easier than with noobs.

My suggestion is that people who have played this before are the experts and keep the noobs in the defuser role, most fun that way :)","Mar 4, 2017 at 7:35 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 14:17:33.684772,theSHHAS,Fun for the whole family!,"(Update 1.3.0 with Touch support) 
I love this game so far! 
I played it with my brothers for about an hour, taking turns to be the diffuser and manual experts and even got my mom to diffuse a bomb! 
She had some trouble grabbing stuff and kept dropping the bomb everywhere but that's probably because she's old and not too good with new technology. 
But she still managed (With my expert help) to diffuse the bomb with about a minute left. 
The only thing that annoyed me was the constant re-adjsuting of the straps and the ipd slider on the Rift when we were taking turns, but that's just how it is when a lot of people play together with one Rift. 
I highly reccomend this game for anyone who has at least 1 friend or family member to play with! 
I would also love to see some kind of single player mode or challenges maybe in a future update. 
Love the game, good work!","Jan 28, 2017 at 4:59 AM",5, 6,

The bombs get increasingly more difficult to defuse and you need to depend on your friend who is reading the bomb defuse manual. Adding 3 or 4 people to your bomb defusal crew will make this game pretty hellish when everyone is trying to bark orders at you to finish the level in the time limit.,"Dec 15, 2016 at 2:44 AM",4, 4,
