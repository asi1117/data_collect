2022-05-28 19:16:03.971649,RikkaKami,Only good for Miku fans,"So far the worst  VR rhythm game I played. Callingit rhythm game is actualy streaching it, since you dont need to have any sence of rhythm. All you do is swing your arms to touch swarm of rings going in your direction. The only good point of this game is that it looks good, even though its quite old game.","Jun 7, 2019 at 11:33 PM",3, 65,
