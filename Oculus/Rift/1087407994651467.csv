It was fun to weave through traffic and dodge the goofy cars. I liked the train level where you had to cross the tracks at the right timing. The sound effects were funny. Getting hit by vehicles was intense in VR but also funny to see my guy ragdoll through the air. 
Great for the price.","May 31, 2018 at 9:37 AM",5, 5,
