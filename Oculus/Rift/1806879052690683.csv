2022-05-28 19:21:25.246354,sgtslaughter603,IDk what the bad reviews are about,"Its a lot of fun. Repetitive, but still doesn't get boring as the scenario changes (night/day/ one, two, three lane traffic/ oncoming trafic) . Lots of bikes to upgrade to. It is a blast and has great potential as there are not many good racing/driving games for VR. Driving mechanics could be a little better, but I enjoyed it a lot. Also, please impletment a way to center the view of the headset. The bike is always offcenter and I have to move physically to reach the handles.","Dec 10, 2020 at 8:04 AM",5, 3,

If you could elaborate what were you expecting just let us know, and remember that you can ask for a refund if you haven't played the game that much!"
2022-05-28 19:21:25.277271,TboneSnake,i felt like crying,"definatly the very worst pcvr game ive ever played , one super hot blurry blocky mess , even the bike is way way way out of scale , im glad i got it on sale for 70p but i still feel like weeping .
To the developers...... there is nothing wrong with my pc it is powerful enough to run all my games at medium to high settings with super sampling at 1.2, the problem is your game is simply terrible both to look at and play.","Jun 15, 2019 at 5:34 AM",1, 10,"Hi Tbone, thanks for purchasing our game. We are sad that you could not play the game with sharp resolution, would you mind to contact us in facebook to understand if this is a problem of the build your are running or some specific config on your pc?
Thanks for the review anyway."
2022-05-28 19:21:25.292231,FastLawyer,It's not as bad as the review scores,"This isn't what I would call a good game. However, I don't think it's all that bad and it can be fun. I got it for .99 cents USD and think it was worth it. It's a simple arcade bike racing game. You grab the handle bars and then use your motion controllers like you had an imaginary steering wheel to guide your bike across the arcade-like simple tracks. The only thing that I did not like, was how grindy the game is to get upgrades or buy a new bike. See my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/zF7F_OyiTsE","Mar 2, 2019 at 7:16 AM",3, 11,"Hey man, thanks for the review. Indeed we got some mixed ratings and tried to help everyone who had troubles, but it is hard to please all. I too think the grinding is too much and probably will be updating that in a next version. Cheers!"

2022-05-28 19:21:28.422858,ParaLoader,Mixed feelings.,"Edit: Seems to be working for me again.
Indeed a simple arcade ride game. Will play again to update the review to a proper one.
My frustrations at the beginning below (the motor cycle snaps to hands if you extend them and squeeze even without touching the steering).
====================================================

Couldn't play the game, as the bike's handles are way past my playing area (2x2 or 3x3 meter). So it's weird, becuase to drive the freaking thing, I have to grab something PAST THE RIFT SENSORS (I have 2) on the desk!
:c
Please fix this, at least make it possible to adjust the position of the motorcycle at the beginning.","Jul 17, 2019 at 4:22 PM",3, 5,"HI ParaLoader, thanks for your review. Usually the handles are relative to your own position when you start the race, so it depends on when you select the Ride buttons. It is not fixed in your own space. I will ask the team to take a look into that and make it near, but as far from our tests it wasn't past the sensors, only if you start the game at the edge of your area..."
