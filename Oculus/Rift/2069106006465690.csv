2022-05-28 17:21:42.839179,price_kelley,The last Oculus Premiere?,"Never having played the first game I missed all the hype for the second completely, to find out what all the hype was about I installed this and was dissapointed, regardless of how the first ended or what the sequal promises ill rate this ""trailer -demo"" for what I found it to be, DULL. I state this because of the speed in which the demo playes out, ive been more captivated by a sand timer! seriously, to captivate and drag in a new audience that may also go ahead full steam to purchase the first??? Nah... didnt do it for me, yall gonna have game fans true and fact, people that lved the first title and are maybe over hyped for a second but for a newbie to the genre - this sucked bug time! Ill give ya'll a good example of how to do it the right way: Assasins creed (Xbox360) picke dup the second game and was hoocked never having played it before or even heard about it, went on after completion to purchase the first and then followed the game for years to nextgen console, I have the stack of physical discs as evidence! (like a library yall) - and thats how its done!  Graphics seemed pretty good but not the best ive seen, there was no user input throughout ( apart from you can turn your head ) and theres nothing more to say, hope ya'll enjoy the game when its released, apparently this is the last piece of software the facebook people will make or promote specifically for the Rift and gen1 Quest because it appears they are throwing the towel in on supporting all us ""old gen"" CV1 owners (thanks) and with that upsell new hardware or rather forcefeed it when the older tech shouldnt even be an issue because only a very small minority own or have ever used VR and iif you want more people to get in to it give them all the options (not just ""here you go"" ""you need the latest edition at the highest price tag that might last a few years before its worthless""). Anyway.... thats my review, go away now.",Aug 13 at 1:02 PM,2, 3,

Lone echo was the first VR game that made me so immersed that i got super scared when i was supposed to, got heart touched when nessicary and paniced like i was actually there.

And this trailer looks amazing and I know it will be as amazing on Rift as the first one was and I’m sure worth the wait! I can’t wait. I got caught up in the urgency of Liv’s voice in the trailer.

I am however a huge fan of Lone Echo and I'm eagerly awaiting the release of Lone Echo 2, like everyone else. But this ""experience"" is hardly worth downloading. I'd recommend just watching the ""VR"" video stream of it on your phone.

I know LE2 has been on the back burner, but I hope it releases soon. There's a lot of loyal fans out there that are feeling a little jilted by the delays and lack of news. But we also know a masterpiece can't be rushed. No pressure devs.","Sep 12, 2020 at 8:59 PM",3, 5,

Come on people.  It's a trailer.  It's not the game.  It's a trailer.

2022-05-28 17:22:11.263154,tommosaur,Can't wait,"Lone Echo is one of my all time top 3 VR games so far, so much better than most other things out there, and actually so excellent, that it is among my favorite all time top games list, no matter if VR or not. 
Such a stellar package of great story, excellent presentation, very good controls and gameplay, very well done locomotion, i could go on and on, just love it.
(While so many aspects are so good, most of all one really feels like having a connection with the other person and experiencing something together, quite an achievement)
Weird i somehow missed this part 2 preview VR experience so long (why don't you recommend it to me Oculus! :) )
Oh yeah, maybe i should also say something about this part 2 preview experience: =)
So of course visually it is again great, the directional 3D sound side very good, too and with its great story presentation wants me to jump into the game right away. I was initially a bit sad that one could not move at all, but makes sense of course regarding the story portion of it.
Overall of course still at worst A+

I have a Rift and am also getting a Quest, so i can play the self contained quick in and out things on the Quest, but games like Lone Echo are why i love also having the Rift, things on this level will just take a few more years until doable in an all self contained device this nicely and i hope Oculus doesn't stop to support getting such awesome things created.
Things like Lone Echo are what makes one not just dream of but really dive fully into an amazing world and show how one can experience things in VR like not possible with any other medium or technology.
Thanks to the creators, you really made something that gives people memories one looks fondly back to for a long time and i'll buy part 2 day one for sure =)","May 10, 2019 at 10:30 AM",5, 26,

I just hope for a longer game (even if the first was much longer than average title). I also hope the gameplay will be deeper: have like 10% or 5% of the game with fight could be better for me. L.E. is not a shooter but have some extra feature could be better for him to me. The first one only have repair/cut/scan... and even if it's one of the best VR game, this one deserve much!

I will buy it for sure with eyes closed! :)

NB: Please Oculus make AAA title like this one every month! Because to me, yours, are better than every other game on this store.

2022-05-28 17:22:14.415722,BLUE_S1X,"2019, a lonely year for VR","Of all software available for the Oculus Rift, nothing (so far) even comes close to the must-have system-seller nature and quality of Lone Echo. And there's no reason to believe that Ready at Dawn will not upstage the original in every way in 2019.

From the brief non-interactive demo it is already clear that visual fidelity will be getting an upgrade, with Captain Rhodes hair being animated with real time zero gravity physics and an even more expressive range of facial animation, both elements that will surely apply to whatever new characters players will get to encounter in the sequel. The added character and personality of the cubesats also hints at a finer level of narrative design, because after the theme of the first title having been isolation and loneliness, players are probably about ready to make some new virtual friends on their next adventure.

But the far biggest and most exciting upgrade on the horizon, will surely be Lone Echo 2's combat mechanics, currently going through an unofficial beta test in Echo Combat.

I absolutely cannot wait for this game to launch, because I never spent as much consecutive hours in my Rift as I did playing the original, and sadly that experience has also spoiled me for most other VR games, that still appear to be stuck several generations behind Ready at Dawn's absolute landmark achievement.

See you in 2019 Jack! I hope Olivia can also wait that long...","Oct 26, 2018 at 5:15 AM",5, 98,

I'm a deafie software developer, and really need to see software such as these gain subtitles.   As founder of Blur Busters and inventor of TestUFO, I actually had a contract with the Oculus Kickstarter (pre-Facebook) to help them with low-persistence for virtual reality.  But, myself, I am a deafie!

Oculus Store gets docked a star because it does not have a ""Subtitles: Yes/No"" field like SteamVR does. I heard through a friend that some group at Gallaudet University (deaf university) is considering a lawsuit to Oculus to humbly request Oculus to make a minor change to Oculus Store (a Subtitles Yes/No checkbox) to get them to at least tell deaf gamers whether a VR game has subtitles or not.

This is the future of game trailers basically, imo, at least in VR.

Edit: Well, the actual ""trailer"" experience in VR isn't particularly exciting or anything. It's actually quite slow and nothing really happens at all. But, I still absolutely feel this approach to trailers in VR, making them actually be VR themselves, is the future of this kind of thing, especially for game trailers. I just hope that if more companies do it the Oculus adds a clear and seperate ""tab"" for these VR trailers. Mixing them in among all the other stuff will just fill the store pages up with basically ads.","Nov 13, 2018 at 8:22 AM",5, 1,

So good I bought the original....  Why? primarily because this gave me the appetite for something special, and I wasn't disappointed.

This is effectively an excellent 360 video which I assumed was rendered on very high end hardware so I didn't really expect the original Lone Echo to be quite so perfect, but it was! I was totally blown away by it and so now i'm expecting big things from this one when it finally arrives... 
 My Rig:  i7-4790/ 1070Ti

I have to say what I've seen here looks very impressive. This is defo my kinda game.  They're not giving much away here but the character animations and environmental detail looks as tho we are about to see VR being taken to a whole new level of immersion.

So the big question is...  WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN will it be released?
