2022-05-28 19:44:52.897881,Sanka31,Interact with sacred geometry,"May only interest people who already know a bit what sacred geometry is... Very interesting to manipulate 3D objects to get a better 3D representation of the shapes, and also about Pi and Phi ratios. Liked the video too (made me think about Nassim Haramein's theory), and ""El Castillo"". Thanks to the developer for sharing it, knowing probably that so few people would be interested !","Dec 22, 2017 at 9:33 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 19:44:52.913837,morland914,Awesome Concept no WMR support,I would give it a ten if the designer could make it work on Windows Mixed Reality. For now I can only walk around the area but can't interact with the objects. I think a puzzle game that requires knowledge of these geometric concepts would be amazing. I hope you incorporate it eventually.,"May 6, 2018 at 2:59 AM",3, 0,
