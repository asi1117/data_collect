2022-05-28 20:46:41.742550,Satconcook,When 2D meets 3D,"I like the effects of taking a comic book and bringing you into it. It has an interesting 2D/3D mix with music and some sound effects and some 360 degree scenes. Certainly makes a basic comic book more interesting. There are few comics that are in English, Japanese and Korean, but more in Korean. Most of them are just 1 or two short stories but would love to see longer series in English. I could see this eventually leading to in app purchases to more comics. What it has now is worth checking out if you enjoy comics. Had a weird thing where the hand would keep jumping to the center of my face and I think it is an intermediate tracking loss of the Rift S.","Feb 7, 2020 at 2:04 PM",5, 6,
