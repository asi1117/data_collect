My Quick Thoughts:
A cool and very cute puzzle platforming game in the style of Lucky's Tale but with a Zelda vibe.
The ability to grab the terrain and move it around to work out where to go and what to do is a really cool mechanic and works great here.
This is not just a straight forward platformer, you will need to manipulate the environment to help you succeed.","Apr 27, 2018 at 10:44 PM",4, 18,

And it is even worse not to translate it into the most spoken and extended language in the world, Spanish","Apr 28, 2018 at 4:11 AM",1, 2,
