2022-05-28 18:07:42.955373,WG1,Very Excellent Overview of Mars Mission,"Inspirational , Dr. Aldrin quickly explains the concept of a perpetual cycling shuttle system to support multiple missions to Mars. Excellent use of VR to set the presentation stage.

Advise to ignore the sad little ignorant trolls sending negative reviews","Feb 20, 2020 at 7:28 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 18:07:42.970333,Billorean,Great free educational experience,"Firstly I was sitting when loading this, but upon seeing Buzz stood in front of me I felt compelled to stand. It was a treat to be opposite such a pioneer and look him in the eye, albeit virtually. I really appreciated that and would love to see more with the likes of Sir David Attenborough etc. It's another marvel of VR where we can meet our heroes.

The experience lasts maybe 10 minutes, I found it fairly inspiring but I don't need persuasion for us to colonise the solar system, for educators able to share this experience with their learners it's almost silly not to.

A 5 star review system is limited, and I'm a tough critic, but for what this is, and it being free, I will give it 5/5. I can only hope this is just a taste of things to come.","Feb 10, 2020 at 5:28 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:07:42.984296,HarbingerThrace,LOVE EXPERIENCES LIKE THIS,"Was super informative, fun and on top of it FREE.  Buzz seems like a smart and cool guy.  Thanks devs for making something like this.  Keep 'em coming.","Feb 7, 2020 at 3:46 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:07:42.999256,Angelina Starr,More power to Buzz and the trip to Mars,"I can't help but smile as I watch Mr. Aldrin still show the same awe and excitement I had at six years old when my dad let me stay home from school to watch the launching and landings in 1969.

His idea for colonizing Mars is presented simply enough for the layman and interesting enough for those of us who have more than a keen eye on this upcoming era of exploration.

For me, everything flowed smoothly, with zero glitches.  For those who complained about Buzz appearing to high on the screen, you do know you can reset the view right?","Mar 11, 2019 at 10:19 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:07:43.014216,Redcomet,What a time to be alive!,"He was born Edwin Eugene, but he loved to be called Buzz. So he made it his first legal name by 1988. Even though if we should pick a date that marked his long career, that would be 1969. July 21st to be precise, at 03:15:16 UTC. When he became the second human being to set foot on the Moon.
Today I met Dr. Aldrin, not in person of course, but through this amazing VR experience, called Cycling Pathways to Mars, that shows exactly what virtual reality was made for. It was made by dreamers, for dreamers!
I know I come late to this, but I'm wondering why this wasn't talked out loud! It's a primer in holographic VR. And it's wonderfully inspiring. As much as an 88 years old - who's not tired of exploring the bounds of space - can be, when dealing with his own dreams.
He's a visionary. And an engineer. Even though he addresses himself as ""someone who will be remembered for just kicking some moondust"". But his idea for traveling to Mars, albeit seeming scifi-ish, it's worth being experienced first hand, through this free VR experience. Cause watching a trailer can hardly convey the sense of awe when watching the Cycler cruise over your head!
I pray for the impossible to become possible","Jan 19, 2019 at 6:30 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:07:46.149829,Bachus65,"OK, for what it is  : /","Good video, did not set up correctly, Buzz was standing slightly above me. Over all not the worst, not the best app. but enjoyable none the least.","Dec 3, 2018 at 7:20 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:07:46.164789,SirZartan,I wanted to like this,"I wanted to like this title but this is the most glitchy, horrible, unpolished experience I've EVER had on oculus.  I have played content on both Steam and Oculus and this is the ONLY title I've ever gotten that simply does not work well AT all.","Oct 11, 2018 at 2:42 AM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 18:07:46.178752,Captain_Howdy,What you need is a rocket experience,"Hehe, Buzz ""I do anything for  a buck or two"" Aldrin is fittingly portrayed as the ghost of the man he once was, a walking stiff
Just one of his many money grabbing schemes

We won't go to the moon an we will neither go to Mars, just ain't gonna happen, for one the Martian soil is not rich enough in nutrients for food to grow in
They'd have to import tons of minerals, stuff like phosphorus and potassium to at least make the sterile soil of the dea.... uhr red planet yield any crops at all.

About the presentation, Buzz is kinda hipping and hopping on his feet as if he could burst into rapping about the ""rocket experience"" in this reviews' title
He actually  made a rap with Snoop dog, really, here take a look https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRI6BghJ1PU

What more proof does one  need that Buzz does anything... I said anyy thiiing for a couple of bucks (just like Mary in Joe's garage)

Pretty much a boring uninspiring video","Sep 6, 2018 at 2:16 AM",1, 4,

2022-05-28 18:07:49.316360,BugLord,"Cool Presentation, Silly Idea","I look forward to more VR content of interesting ideas, documentaries, and displays of technology. This is interesting and fun to watch. The holographic Buzz Aldrin is a little wonky, but it's ok. The Mars plan though, it's just silly. Why is it better to send the first humans to Io first? Poor Buzz only has ideas and no tech. The cycler plan will never happen, but it is neat to see the proposal.","Apr 19, 2018 at 12:47 PM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 18:07:52.502837,MaddogMcCree,Nice... and weird,"Summarizing: Presentation 6 out of 10, Content 2 out of 10. As an avid space fan i felt i just had to see this. I have huge respect for dr Aldrin, and therefore i feel i must leave an honest review. It was an... interesting experience. The graphics are quite nicely done but on the content front it just lacks punch. My main gripe is with the content. It is never explained what the proposed spacecraft exactly do, why it is such an ""efficient way to travel"" and why there are even called cyclers (other than resembling a wheel i suppose?) There are a few scientific flaws in the presentation (like seeing stars from moon surface)  and mr aldrins eyes look unnatural. As if added in postproduction or something. Judging by the discription i supposed this would give me insight in mr aldrin's plan for going to mars, but it did not. On the positive side, this experience shows the enormous potential for educational purposes. If you are a space fan like me, thirsty for knowledge i can recommend Apollo 11. IT.IS.BRILLIANT.","Oct 15, 2017 at 5:02 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 18:07:52.517797,DWinner9971,,"This is an interesting short experience that is much better than a 3D 360 degree video would have been. Using supersampling (as I always do), I was also pleased with the graphical quality, once I had maxed out the included settings options. I would like to see a longer, more in-depth version, and I would love to see this kind of content from the likes of NASA and SpaceX as well.","Oct 14, 2017 at 1:39 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 18:07:55.679341,neuro27,"Impressive, Inspiring","For about 10 minutes, this app lets you experience a VR presentation about Dr. Buzz Aldrin's crazy idea to go from Earth to the Moon to Phobos to Mars using spaceships he designed. He gave a few reasons for wanting to carry out this plan, but nothing very convincing, as if becoming a multi-planetary species was an end in itself rather than a means to some other end. The audio/visual quality is top notch. Clearly many talented people were involved in creating the art and design of the experience. If you can spare the time to download this hefty app, you should definitely check it out!","Jun 22, 2017 at 7:56 AM",5, 6,
