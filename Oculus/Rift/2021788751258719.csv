In level one, the  barrels and such are exploding all over the place, taking away points.  I grab the cubes as quickly as they come and toss them in the bin but there is no way to end in the positive.","Feb 29, 2020 at 12:50 PM",1, 6,"Hello Foxlover,

2022-05-28 16:48:44.632175,marc.dugue,Very very bad,"TL/DR : DON'T WORK ON PC (Rift Q) !! Works fine on Quest

This game looks cute but is very bad : I have not been able to go through the first stage. There is maybe something that I have not understood but after many trials I think that this game is a scam. To succeed the stage you have to reach a positive score, but while you are scoring point things happen in the background that are substracting point on your score and you have no control on those things. I have not found a way to score more point than the amount that is substracted in the BG. Each time you fail the only working button is retry, so you can't exit the level. After about 15 fails I had no choice but to kill the app ...   I will google a little to see if there is an obvious solution that I have missed but so far I think that this game is a shame
___EDIT___
After a little investigation on youtube : on the youtuber version, none of the stuff in the BG explode, so he does not receive huge amount of random negative point. On my version 100% of the things in the background explodes, making the game totally unplayable. It's probably a bug, so I will check again in a fex days  if it is fixed, if so I will edit this message again.
____EDIT AGAIN___
On the Rift Q version 100% of the elements in the BG explodes, making the first level unplayable. On the Quest version the level is perfectly playable.

I don't know how to reply to the dev so here is my answer : 
My computer is a blade 15 using a Core i7 with 64Gb of RAM and an Nvidia RTX2080 Max Q. I don't think that it's a performance issue ... but I'll send you an email if you want me to run some tests to help find the bug.","Jan 21, 2020 at 6:56 PM",1, 10,"Hello Marc.Dugue, 
This sounds like it might be a performance issue, please send in a customer service ticket to support@armature.zendesk.com and we can see if we can figure out what is going on here.

2022-05-28 16:48:44.647134,General3571,Good fun for everyone,"Buying this game for 8 dollars I wasnt expecting much, as I bought it mainly for the kids, but the cute characters and music create a fun parlor style game set in an immense factory as you test your skills in different activities. The game doesnt boast a massive amount of content but still has plenty to offer as you progress through the levels and skills get harder and harder.
My only criticism will be the controls for the massive robots, as you push forward it wants to go backwards and you change direction it goes all wonky and can be very frustrating (please pass on info if you know anything about this). However these levels are only a fraction of the game. Worth a buy and good game for the whole family.","Jan 24, 2020 at 2:39 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 16:48:44.662094,pabe05,Be  a factory worker like you dreamed of,"Same guys that made Sports Scramble. 
The environment is really well done and looks massive. Far out idea of working in a factory far far away.  Alot of mini games that you can go back and try to improve on as you get better at the game. Controlling the huge robot gets more complicated as you go up in rank. Worth the measly amount of money they are asking.  May look kiddish but gets real challenging. Cross platform if own Rift (s) and Quest. Go version is separate. Go to their website to see what other games they are envolved in. (Fortnite ...). Hoping more vr games come in the future from Armature.","Jan 19, 2020 at 11:36 PM",5, 5,
