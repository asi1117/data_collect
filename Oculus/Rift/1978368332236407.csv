I'm just beginning to explore but wanted to give my thanks to the developers.","Apr 26, 2021 at 3:39 PM",5, 1,"Hi Kristin!

Glad you're enjoying Mind Labyrinth VR Dreams! Comments like this makes our day. Thanks for playing our title!

Best!"
2022-05-28 18:51:35.303809,giladbauman,Very very meh,"It's cute, but not very good. It is easy to get stuck in geometry, and particles are always turning towards your head, which makes large particles very distracting. Overall I wouldn't buy if it wasn't for the great reviews, and therefore I am adding my own.","Sep 2, 2020 at 7:19 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:51:35.318769,wefoundjorge,Underwhelmed,"All of the positive reviews had me expecting way more. Its decent and the art style is nice but theres a weird bloom effect that goes on all the time that ruins it for me ( im playing it maxed out and no its not the godrays im talking about). Music is good but again, it could be better specialy since it plays such a huge role in this game/meditation app. id give it 2.5 at 10$ or if you find it on sale for 5 bucks id say its worth a 3.5/5","Jul 8, 2020 at 3:40 PM",3, 8,

Beautiful, subtle, simple and poetic. Perfect for relaxing after a hard day, a great space to unwind. 

Thank you for this app!","Aug 20, 2020 at 4:13 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:51:35.348690,DTH,,I love it.  The problem that I have is that If I'm holding something in both hands I can not soot for the sayings.  Witch is the most importent part of the game.  If I drop one of the items I can touch my RL floor but can not reach the item.  I love how each area has their own bright color theme.   Sometimes I like to just sit and listen to the music and watch what is going on around me.  I look forward to more scenes.,"May 1, 2020 at 11:52 AM",4, 6,"Hi DTH!

I'm really glad you've enjoyed Mind Labyrinth! To make it easier for you to reach and grab objects that fall on the ground make sure to recenter and recalibrate your position! The real floor should match the virtual floor and you should be able to reach objects on the ground more easly.

Thanks again for your kind words!"

You have a selection of ""worlds"" to explore or relax in.  The  music is great, but you can turn it off if you want.    There are natrually a few things that could be improved and/or explanded upon and I'm sure they will be .","Oct 11, 2019 at 11:48 PM",5, 7,

2022-05-28 18:51:38.488292,shogunmn,Great Expirence,"The environments, music and graphics are spectactular. I really enjoy freedom to explore and relax. However, and hopefully there is  a fix soon but this is nearly a deal breaker for me: The meditations, breathing exercises etc. appear to be either broken or stuck loading. I was unable to  get any of the ones I found to load. Everything else is excellent. I hope that area has an incoming fix if I'm not missing something. Great work even with this current issue. I seem to replicate the same issue each time and have exhuasted all options I can  think of.  Is there something I am missing? EDIT: Thanks for the response. This makes sense, I understand now. I think the menu screen with the image of a load screen is what threw me off.  User error. Thank you again and also testing, awesome application, this has soo much potential!","Jun 3, 2019 at 8:31 AM",5, 11,"Hi shogunmn and thanks for your kind words.

We've looked into your issue but we aren't able to reproduce it. Basically when you approach a meditation refuge (those one with the bright spheres) you need to get close enough to them until it asks you to press A to enter them.

Then press A one time only until the fade starts. When the fade starts in about 2 to 3 seconds it should fade out again and you should find yourself inside the refuge.

Then to start the breathing exercise you just need to point and shoot the bright rune in the middle of the circle and after few seconds the exercise will start.

To exit, just press A again.

We just tried multiple times in multiple refugees in the current publicly available build and everything works at it should. Are you sure you did everything as I just explained?

If you're willing to further explain the issue and gives us more info please feel free to reach us at: frostearthstudio@hotmail.com .

If you could please specify what menu options you had selected like (Graphics,Language,movement options) and so on it would be really helpful.

Thanks!

2022-05-28 18:51:38.504249,BJJ_CAT,Great game,"I really wanted to have something like this game. 
Awesome music and graphics. 
Great for relaxation and mind cleaning, loved way that touch controllers programmed (i prefer smooth sticks movement rather than teleporting) 

What would be really great if you can make worlds bigger!","Dec 16, 2018 at 3:35 AM",5, 15,Many thanks! We will release very soon a free new music DLC with exciting new tracks...
2022-05-28 18:51:41.609943,DisplayVRC,relaxation,"Very Relaxing Game 
Im into horror games and some good hardrock music.
This game is none of that. And i give it a 5 * rating.
The graphics are a little low even on ultra settings but once ur in the game and you start listening to the music you forget about that.
Play this game before u go to sleep instead of some jumpscares game and you will have wonderfull dreams ...","Nov 14, 2018 at 3:18 AM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 18:51:41.625900,nightcat.mau,A Proming Start,"This game is stupidly pretty, provided you can run the graphics on high. Medium seemed meh and low was all right, but nothing to write home about. But I appreciate different levels of graphics are needed for different rigs. 
To save you reading the instructions you are going to need your A button for almost everything. Menu, selecting the orbs, etc. And be aware that some items can only be interacted with using your right hand. That said it is a wonderfully pretty and relaxing game, though there are some bugs. 
Once you’ve unlocked the secret area and gone where you think you need to, don’t move! I did and had an interesting burgee experience. I also got body-slammed by a rhino, so I’d be wary of petting the nice animals since they turn abruptly and don’t interact anyhow. Overall it is a good experience though I think labeling it as emotional exploration is a big stretch.
There are no cues on how a piece should make you feel and music is a very personal thing. What calms one person down can give other people the serious jitters. All that said, it’s worth the asking price if you can accept it for a meditation app with light adventure elements like exploring, finding orbs and playing with various props.","Oct 28, 2018 at 9:32 AM",5, 24,"Hi,

We are very happy you like the title and thank you for your precious feedback. 
We agree with you about the music, it's a personal emotional experience normally connected to the events of our life and our personal culture. 

In an totally immersive experience like Mind Labyrinth VR Dreams everyone can find the right balance between music and environments experiencing the high quality of the 30 different music tracks that you can change at any time in any level from the menu. Just open it with the left touch menu button and change the music through the arrows on the right... Do this until you will find the emotion that you feel better. 

Mind Labyrinth VR Dreams is a project that is continuously improved and developed in order to give the better experience possible. 

We're just working on a new patch that will coming soon and that will improve some aspects of the title.

Thanks for your review!

Kind regards

2022-05-28 18:51:41.640860,Blue_Snowflake,,"This game has enchanting atmospheres, something that makes you want to sit on one of those beautiful flying rocks and just look around in pure relaxation while your mind empties of all bad things.
I mostly play first person shooters yet this game quickly made it to my top three.
10/10 would totally recommend.","Feb 26, 2019 at 11:36 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:51:41.654823,Littlenightmarez,,"I have tried few other meditation and relax experiences and games but this one has something more. Most of the meditation apps you can not walk, you just have fixed spot where you can look around. 

On this one you have free locomotion and you can interact with the environment,you can find some hidden secrets and if you find all the pink spheres you unlock a unique scenario.

And the music.. just awesome.","Feb 9, 2019 at 5:02 AM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 18:51:41.670780,RuneSR2,Not good enough - feels like PSVR,"I really wanted to like this app, but in the end I didn't. First of all textures are generally far too low res, feels like PlaystationVR resolution - check out Xing if someone wants to know how textures should be done in PCVR. Levels of polys were low too - again reminded me of PlaystationVR. Of course low res textures and low poly count aren't all bad, but meant that I got solid 90 fps even when forcing super sampling 2.0 on my heavily oc'ed GTX 1080 :-)
All in all this app feels like some dude having tried to make a game, but then gave up after designing about 10 levels - and then released these dead and lifeless levels as an app where you can walk around and ""relax"" to different kinds of music. For meditation, mindfulness and relaxation there are far better apps on the Rift, even where professional therapists guide you. This app has none of that. Ok, maybe the levels aren't all dead and lifeless, I did see something like two birds, but you get the idea. The app needs far higher poly count (and much greater view distance), greatly enhanced texture resolutions, more life - and a proper voice over - quoting different thinkers isn't good enough, the quotes felt like a cheap way to cover for the content that simply isn't there. Currently I would consider paying more than 5 ot 10 bucks for this experience.","Feb 24, 2019 at 1:34 AM",2, 2,"Hi and thanks for your feedback.

As always feedbacks are truly important to us and we always take those kind of feedbacks in mind when deciding how to improve our title. First of all about the low res textures, have you tried chosing from the Menu (left Touch - Menu button) the highest level of quality?

Also I think it's worth noticing there could be more life than what you may see at first in many levels. We have some really colorful and wonderful animals that only spawn after a while while you explore a scene to give you that sense of reward and surprise of keep exploring.

It's also worth noticing that besides revealing quotes, relaxing and hearing the music there is also the chance to find and collect all the Opportunities you'll be able to find in all the levels which will unlock a new one that you may find really interesting!

Last but not least we're already working hard to release our first and newest content update which will greatly increase the content of the game and that's just our first patch. More will come in the near future...

Music therapy and chromotherapy:

Mind Labyrinth is about emotions that you can only get through really great music and dreamlike environments - based on serious and consolidated psychological studies - and not directly through technical oriented meditation exercises (we have preferred to show some meaningful quotations to allow everyone the freedom to orient their thoughts).

Our goal is to reach your senses with music and colors and we hope you'll be able to appreciate the true emotional side of this product that find in music research and atmospheres its own uniqueness.

Thanks!
