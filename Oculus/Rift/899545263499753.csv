2022-05-28 15:34:59.514700,kriszvandaar,Cool tower defense game...,"I loved this game a lot. Looks very cool, and it's funny either. I didn't have problems with the controls so I enjoyed it a lot, but after a few level, I just can't go further anymore, and I admit that I m not a genius, but still don't get it what I supposed to do... I love it, but I reached a level on the first day, that I can't beat, even I try so hard... Thanks for answer to the developers! I'm glad to see that some creators  cares about their product after years! It's not a well used thing on Oculus, so I give the five stars, and I'll try to beat that beastie game again. Cheers!","Mar 17, 2021 at 10:07 AM",5, 3,"Hi! Hopefully, you will beat it soon enough! But, if it is a bit too much, be sure to contact us at support@zenstudios.com so we can help a little!"
2022-05-28 15:34:59.529661,FastLawyer,Looks like a fun TD arcade game,"However, I am using the Xbox One Controller (that comes with the Rift) and it's almost impossible to aim with either the bow & arrow or the ballista because the controls are way too sensitive. There is no option to slide the sensitivity of the joystick controls. Makes game almost impossible to play. Even then, I would say it doesn't control as smoothly as it should, janky controls overall. That's a shame because I was enjoying the level designs and the TD elements, but with spotty controls at best, I have no choice but to stop playing and uninstall.","Nov 30, 2018 at 3:18 PM",2, 4,Hi Superattorney!

2022-05-28 15:34:59.545617,Creolucis,One of the greatest tower defense games,"This is a full fletched tower defence game with a lot of content. A lot of campaign missions, levels and fullfilling upgrades, troop management, castle editor, and half decent story.  Been playing for 5 hours straight when I first bought it and theres a lot of gameplay left. Really replayable too!

Works with touch, but is really meant to be played with a controller, as 3d hand movement is not used.

If you loved the ""Age of war"", ""Defend your castle"" and other stick castle war games on browsers/mobile.... and you want it without any microtransactions? This is your game!

YUUGE creds to the devs for NOT making this an another microtransactions game.","Jul 13, 2017 at 5:26 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 15:34:59.581522,Ayatoldya_muckhuck,meh,"Ok game, didn't really hook me in. I love tower defense games, but I wouldn't really call this a traditional tower defense game. Action rpg? definitely not. Overpriced IMO, more like a browser game.","Sep 8, 2017 at 12:03 AM",2, 1,"Hi meh! Thanks for your feedback! What do you think, how could we improve our game, so you'd have a much better experience next time?"
2022-05-28 15:35:02.748052,armoden,Touch controllers?,"Is this supposed to work with touch controllers?  It does not.  First task is shooting a ballista, and that's a complete fail with touch.","Jul 11, 2017 at 9:20 AM",1, 2,Hi armoden! Could you please contact us at support@zenstudios.com?
