2022-05-28 19:35:54.834907,byteframe,Lots of medical knowledge.,"Training stuff, 360 videos, quizzes etc. Requires account registration. I wanted someone get surgery and it was smelly.","May 15, 2021 at 12:48 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:35:54.848869,Annubus,,Why is this even on my system and why cant I uninstall it?  I do not want to see this app so dont force me to.,"Sep 26, 2019 at 7:37 AM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 19:35:54.863829,LibraryCube,They won some awards???,"Why do I have to sign up for something? Why can't I use my oculus account info? Why, after I jump through a bunch of hoops to sign up, I still can't acess the software? I was going to demonstrate this to some of our healthcare faculty but not now... I can't even get it to work, Im not going to suggest it to someone else.","Dec 11, 2018 at 4:19 AM",2, 10,
2022-05-28 19:35:54.878789,obarryon.king,will not work,"After a hassle getting the account set up, since the website is about as broken as the interface of this app is and clicking ""resend"" didn't appear to do anything when it actually was, I found that the touch controllers aren't detected or are not used, and pointing with the headset wouldn't click 'Refresh' to go on. It may have refreshed, it was difficult to tell. In any event, it never connected, even though the website for the app said that I was. I would have clicked 0 zero stars if I could.","Jul 20, 2018 at 4:47 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 19:35:54.893749,badwolfx,Think yourselves lucky,"The reviews so far have been about how bad the experience in VR was...well I can't even get that far. Created account and never received the validation email so cannot login. In a way, I am glad, after seeing some of the comments. There is an enormous amount of free medical training material out there, I think I'll stick with that for my CPD, this company is just taking advantage of med students and HCPs and trying to make a quick buck.","Apr 29, 2018 at 5:41 PM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 19:35:58.025484,ReisJD,Bad design,"I want to like the app and I did the one time that it worked.  You have to switch between the headset and PC to login each time you want to use it, so it is a bit tedious.  After my initial use, the app gave a new login code and confirmation email which has yet to allow access for a second use.

It's a great idea to supplement study, and one I'd pay for, but not until it has a smoother user experience.","Mar 26, 2018 at 9:22 AM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 19:35:58.041947,becklarae,Have to subscribe to it,"You have to subscribe to it, for 9.99 per month, and if you want a free trial you have to put in all your credit card info, no thanks.","Mar 25, 2018 at 11:28 AM",1, 18,"All users who create a free account are given access to the platform and to a few free modules, no credit card is required to access this content. However if users enjoy the app they can upgrade to a Premium account to access all other present and future modules."

2022-05-28 19:35:58.072864,cheesepantz,Not designed for the user,This is a very bad way of getting money from people. You have to jump hoops to get into the app. Then they offer you more content before you even try this. Oh and there is no touch support. Please add support for touch. I did not buy oculus to go back to xbox controllers. Very shady way of getting people to try your app. I would have had free content up front with no login then a purchase buttton to get more content and login. That way people can see your work. The more work people have to put in to see free content the more upset they will be. Or they won't see it.,"Mar 24, 2018 at 9:47 AM",1, 12,
