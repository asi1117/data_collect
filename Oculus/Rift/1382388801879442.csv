2022-05-28 15:06:18.164696,TwinFlow,"Great game for VR, but lacking details","I've played the real game with friends and via table top sim, but having this is VR is great. Although its lacking in some areas which could really make this game the one in VR. 

Here is a list of what I think could make this better..

Some character animation would be good, mouth movement when players are talking. 

Dice rolls could be controlled by the player and rolled onto the table. Rather than the computer already RNG'ing the outcome.

More interactivity with the cards and clearer instructions of what cards do what. 

More board animation and details

Hopefully the devs continue work on this and expand on it now we have the quest 2 version.","Feb 7, 2021 at 6:35 AM",3, 8,

2022-05-28 15:06:18.242487,Cyion,,"This game is great!  If you like board games it is a must have.  The multiplayer community for this game has increased since oculus go and PSVR support has been added.  If you are looking for players to play with, the best place to find players is on the Catan VR League discord where we have friendy competitive games and also fun games, then you can join the discord through the website https://catanvr.club/ and there are players at all times of the day looking for games.  As well, you can go to the catan VR discord server https://discord.gg/A8WpAKq (Experiment 7 is the name of developer and name of discord server).   The game just has so much polish and the tavern room that is the background looks so great and there is also like a Japan style room too.  The game itself plays perfectly and I have only noticed like one minor bug that happens and I will tell you how to fix it if it happens to you.  If you take your headset off during a game sometimes there is a bug that causes you to lose the ability to communicate (hearing and speaking to others) and the only fix is to leave and come back.  So if you are waiting for a game to start and this happens, leave and come back and it will be fixed.  If you have already started your game, then you must finish your game before you can communicate again.  Now if you are in the later situation, you can still communicate by using the trade windows so the game is still playable just less convenient for that current game.","Sep 29, 2019 at 3:59 PM",5, 5,Glad that you are enjoying it - and thanks for the report.

one thing I noticed, the AI players seem to be programed to trade with each other first , giving them an advantage","Sep 14, 2019 at 8:26 AM",5, 2,"AI players trade with players that treat them well - human and AI. So if you're blocking in a particular AI, not responding to their trades, or are well in the lead, they will not be as eager to trade with you. On the other hand, if you've accepted past trades or aren't competing for locations, they'll treat you as a more preferred partner. Each AI also has a unique personality, one trait of which includes willingness to trade (with all players/AI). Play around with it some - I think you'll find surprising depth.  :)"
2022-05-28 15:06:21.382090,babyaby1,Great game - expansions?,"This is one of my favourite VR board games. I think it is the perfect use of relaxing VR.  However, my question is to the developers - is there any intention of taking this further?  There are so many variations of this game in the board game version. Any more VR titles/expansions on the cards? Would love to hear from you. Thanks","Jul 11, 2019 at 9:35 PM",5, 5,"Glad that you're enjoying the game. 

Our goal has been getting this on more hardware (we started on the Rift and Gear, and are now also on the Go, Vive and PSVR). As the VR community size is still modest, we've focused our efforts on hardware ports (with cross-platform play) to help get more players for multiplayer games rather than expansions."

2022-05-28 15:06:24.557597,XtremeHardcoreGamer,Good game.,"I never played Catan before but learned it on the fly during the free weekend. I ended up buying it. Catan is an addictive game and there is a good atmosphere to it-- good environments-- although I wouldn't mind a few more environments and a few more avatars (for the AI). The AI avatars have a nice look to them. 

I only give it four stars because- as I only played against the AI, I realized at some point the AI knew what cards I had. No point hiding them at that point. 

The other thing is-- I know this will be controversial, I am not sure the dice rolls are random. In one game I had no settlement bordering the number 11. The 3 AI sure did. 11 has two dots on it, indicating that statistically it wouldn't come up often. Sure enough- almost once per round the number 11 kept being rolled. The next game, I happened to be the 'only' player with a settlement adjacent to 11. I went almost the whole match (hour long?) before I got a hit!!! What are the stats on that? Hundreds of rolls. Before each roll I'd say, ""Come on eleven!"" and noticed it was never 11 although the prior match it was almost always 11. Whatever, I am sure the game is great with friends. It is fun against the frustrating AI too!

Don't take my word on the dice rolls being crooked-- it's just my unscientific impression. Play the game and decide for yourself.","Oct 21, 2018 at 10:15 PM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 15:06:24.573554,Slick1984,New to Catan,"I recently played Catan on the original board game. Although, I lost two out of three, I had fun playing. So, I thought that I'd give this a try. Having the board set up for you is a plus. The game flows easily enough, except for when it's my turn. 

When the game is won, it doesn't show how. I have to assume it was from victory point cards, but it doesn't show the cards. I counted three cities and the largest army, that's 8 victory points. They had two development cards, but it never showed them. It needs to show ALL of the victory points. There is plenty of room between the edge of the play area and the edge of the game board to show the victory point cards.

It's a solid 4 stars. If they tweak the AI a bit and show ALL of the victory points at the end, it may get changed to 5 stars.

***UPDATE*** In response to the devs reply to my review. After playing the AI a little more, I do find personalities. Predictable personalites. The dice rolls are pretty predictable, too. Whenever I make a good play (not always, but too often to be random), the next AI player rolls a ""7"", the next AI player then plays a knight card AND rolls a ""7"" and the final ""7"" of the round is rolled by the last AI player. Yes, I am frequently cleaned out of up to four cards. Some form of this happens nearly every game. Also, nothing was mentioned about the showing of the Victory Point Cards to show how the victory happened. Please put some attention on these issues and you'll get a ""5"" rating from me. Otherwise, a solid ""4"" rating.","Nov 24, 2018 at 9:34 AM",4, 13,"Hello Slick, glad that you're enjoying the game.
Our AI acts a lot like human players - they tend to remember and play favorably towards those who have made favorable plays (trade, settlement location, etc.) to them, and to play unfavorably towards those who have made unfavorable plays to them. They also, like humans, tend to be a bit more aggressive to players in the lead. (this is reset each game - unlike humans, they don't have meta memory that stretches between games)
That being said, each of the AI's has their own unique personality that sits on top of this, with variants around generosity, expansionist tendencies, preference for development cards, cities, and more. These personality quirks also mimic human player preferences, which is why most players end up with AI's that they like more and those who are great rivals.
As an extra note on trade, AI players, like humans, have wants. If you see an AI that has no access to lumber but is lousy with sheep, you'll probably be able to trade them for sheep but see them unwilling to trade away their hard acquired lumber."

Fell in love with game!! Playing online matches has been great and shown me the real charm of CATAN. CATAN VR beats flat screen boardgames hands down because you feel transported to a beautiful room sitting with new or old mates having some friendly rivalry fun. It's my favourite game now.","Jun 19, 2018 at 3:29 PM",5, 5,"Thanks, we're glad that you're enjoying it!"
2022-05-28 15:06:27.751055,PoolfanVr,,"I bought this game being a huge fan of Civ.  This is a lot shallower than Civ but some of its charm is in its simplicity.   I like the game, it was well worth the money but deep thinking strategy does not play a big part in this , it is largely a game of luck but there are strategic decisions to make. Bear in mind though you may play the perfect strategy and find the roll of the dice is not with you.

The game does not gain much, if anything for being a VR title.  You may as well be playing it on your desktop.  As there is a real shortage of real people to play against perhaps the developers could release a desktop version and allow VR players and Desktop players to pitch against one another ?","Jun 6, 2018 at 2:47 AM",4, 12,"Hello PoolfanVR. This is Geoffrey (Creative Director) writing this, and I'm also a huge fan of Civ (1711 hours on Civ V, 498 on Civ VI so far). 
Randomness has always been an element of Catan, but like other combination dice/strategy games, a lot of Catan is about positioning yourself so that when the dice go your way you can capitalize on the event. If you Google ""Catan World Championship"" you can find some pretty advanced strategies. 
As VR is a growing technology, we've focused on the device cross-play (Rift to Gear and Go, and soon to Steam/HTC) to get the biggest multiplayer pool that we can. Sadly, we don't have the license for Desktop/Mobile play (that was given to another company before VR commercial hardware existed), so we contractually aren't able to do VR to PC/Mobile. As more people get their hands on VR our matchmaking pools will get better and better - this is one of those things where as a developer there is a limit to what we can do about audience size.
We hope that you enjoy your Catan VR experience!"

If you're playing single player the AI seems to pick on you a little, but it's still fun.

2022-05-28 15:06:30.921576,McNabb,Great game with minor issues,"Love it, one of my most used apps, and I wasn't familiar with the game before. Just a couple of minor issues: If you select 'Build Settlement' then change your mind, the 'Cancel' button doesn't work: You *have* to build the settlement or quit the app (UPDATE: Problem fixed!). Also, Candamir wins what seems to be about 95% of the games (ALSO AN UPDATE: I'm fine with this). Even with that it's beautiful, really fun to play even though I still haven't figured out all the little details, the portrait representations of opponents is very unique, and I hope it gets other board games (Ticket to Ride, Monopoly, etc.) translated to VR.

One other thing: Sometimes I'll have all the necessary materials and still can't build a village or city, and don't know why. The tuorial isn't very helpful, so maybe some details on the build screen explaining *why* it's not available to build even though the mats are there, or at least some help / tips built into the game.","May 11, 2018 at 8:22 AM",4, 4,"Hello McNabb - Each of the AI has a different play style. Lin is my personal nemesis. If you have the necessary materials to build a settlement/city but can't build one, you might want to make sure that you have a valid placement location (a location touching a road and that is at least 2 intersections away from all other settlements/cities). My guess is that that is the scenario you bumped in to."
2022-05-28 15:06:30.940525,JoshKarlowicz,"Easy to use, but need expansions!","I really love the aspect that you sit around a table with your opponents. This is very easy to use, meaning the controls are point-and-click, you can drag your mini-menu around your FOV, and with touch controls you can play one handed - unless the other hand is occupied by pizza.

BUT I really need to see this game gain the expansions. Seafarers/Cities and Knights would be awesome; If you can find a way to make managing a larger board easy that is.","Apr 19, 2018 at 8:57 AM",5, 10,

Regarding the online community, we have a great group of people on our Discord channel who are waiting to play games! You can find the link to that channel on our website (www.experiment7.com).

Thanks,

Producer Coray"

It is a great app from a gameplay standpoint, but playing with the AI feels like you are being cheated. Red numbers are not rolled as often as you'd think, your opponents will place the robber on your best hex when you are not winning, and one AI player seems to dominate in terms of resource rolls. I was not able to match with anybody after waiting about 5 minutes. If this app becomes popular, it will be by far the best way to virtually play Catan with others.","Mar 22, 2018 at 7:40 AM",5, 6,
