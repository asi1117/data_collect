2022-05-28 17:28:19.147196,BeatzCreations,Unable to use Logitech Wheel (UPDATED),"ive always played this on quest standalone but seen today that it has wheel option on pc version so hit download and jumped in! 

Selected the logitech wheel option in settings, started a race and the wheel and pedals did nothing. I then also never had a button option to quit out as normally i think its the left controller that does that so had to fully quit out the whole game and reload.

Loaded again this time the car was stuck in reverse with the wheel locked to the left so i was constantly going in backwards circles, dont understand what is going on. Will just go back to the Quest version as it seems this doesnt work properly.

(UPDATE)

i use the Logitech G293 with pedals.  I have the G Hub software also as use it for other racing games.

i understand i can set change the settings there but the wheel didnt work at all even though it was selected in the controls page. first time i was sat and didnt move at all, 2nd and 3rd time the car was in constant reverse to the left with no controls changing it.

running game on a RTX 3070 using Oculus Air Link with the Quest 2.

thanks",Apr 13 at 12:57 AM,2, 0,"***UPDATE1***
Hello, Thank you for the information. As far as I understand the G293 behaves very similarly to the G29. We will use this information to dig deeper. Is it possible for you to contact us via support@DashDashRacing.com or Discord https://discord.gg/mHSgbsA ? There I can assign a team member to take care of this case for you.

***Original Comment***
Hi, We officially supported G29 for Logitech. May I ask about the model of your steering wheel?  The game also requires G hub software, from Logitech, in order to function. There you can set operation range, sensitivity, and centering strength. 

For the quit button bug, we have already verified it and should be able to fix it soon. As for the reversing, we are investigating this but if we can confirm the software and hardware you use, we can better verify and fix the bug for you. Sorry for the inconvenience."

2022-05-28 17:28:19.178113,RoEKoN,Better than you're imagining it'll be.,"Hi, my very first review here!
I waited on this one for a week before buying. I feared it would be too cheesy or more for little kids. I knew after the first race or two the game was worth the price. I've still only done about 10 or so races altogether, and while it isn't perfect, it does a great job of making you feel you're really in the car racing and truly captures the MarioKart feel, much more than I would have bet on before buying. 
It's more of a 4 Star leaning towards 5. Main problem being a personal issue with me being too old for the intended audience perhaps. Any other small gripes about this game are easily smothered out with the immersiveness and cool parts and backgrounds on each track. There are no better games in this category and I can EASILY imagine how far these developers will knock one out of the park in the future. It's a solid game that hits the spot.","Jun 20, 2021 at 2:27 PM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 17:28:19.192076,Squadaloo,"Not Perfect, but Shockingly Polished","I picked this game up a few months ago and began playing it again recently. While I'm giving it a 5/5, I wouldn't say it's perfect:  the AI difficulty is a little too high at times and some of the tracks have just too much going on.

However, I still give it a 5 because those issues aside, this is the closest thing to Mario Kart in VR as you can get.  The game actually handles very well, the mechanics are pretty on point, and the track designs with a few exceptions are fun.  I've played kart racers from major studios that didn't feel as good as this game does.  They've kept up with the content and made balance changes since the last time I played a few months ago that have only helped.

Honestly, more people should play this because it's I'd say it accomplishes what it sets out to do with a level of competence one would expect from a much larger developer.","May 9, 2021 at 6:00 AM",5, 14,

2022-05-28 17:28:22.337663,DoppGanger,Pleasantly Surprised,"I'm not big on racing games, I find them to be quite boring, but after finding out about it on BMF's channel (youtube) and watching a few videos on this game it peaked my interest and I decided to take the leap and buy it and boy am I happy I did! 

The art style, sounds, music and graphics are great! The gameplay just feels... right, is the only way I can explain it. They pulled it off well. It's so fun! Love the customization! (Hope they continue to add more customization items to unlock!) People love chasing something new to unlock, as do I. Absolutley love being able to use weapons/boosts/etc which really enriches the gameplay (This and the customization is what really intrigued me). The maps! Very well done, the more difficult ones get pretty wild, looking forward to them adding even more, which they have already stated they plan to do. 

There are many things to do in the game (including online multiplayer!) and lots of things to unlock/achieve, I can see this game having longevity for sure.

The developers seem very passionate, great at communicating with their player base and seem to be on top of things. Heck I was so impressed with this game and the devs I bought it for a friend as well.

I have not ran into any bugs so far, the only thing I've seen is in career mode some of the first few missions when it shows the comic there is a weird yellow glare under the pages, doesnt show up in later missions, though I'm sure thats something minor that will be fixed soon.

Its's cross-play, cross-buy and only $25, buy it and thank me later.","Dec 28, 2020 at 4:54 AM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 17:28:22.353620,Skyjogger,Great game - question on steering wheel,"Update: thanks for the quick reply, I really hope the t150 will be supported!

—

Great game, devs, congrats! Nothing else to add on that front!

My only comment is that I don’t find the user menu very intuitive. 

Anyway, once I managed to get to choosing the controls (I want to use a steering wheel - I have a thrustmaster t150), I obviously selected the thrustmaster option but the wheel doesn’t work (nb the wheel in itself definitely works fine, I use it for project cars 2 for example and have no issues) and there don’t seem to be any other sub-options except for “thrustmaster” in a general way. 

So in a nutshell, is the t150 supported and, if it is, how do you configure it? If it isn’t, please add it because I think that it’s a pretty standard wheel which many people have. To be honest, I only decided to definitely buy this game because I saw that thrustmaster was supported. 

Thanks a lot!","Jan 8, 2021 at 8:30 PM",5, 4,"It's great to hear you liked the game!

We are revamping the UI.

Also, we tested this with T500. However, we are going to buy the T150 to test this for you but it will require about 3-4 weeks to complete. Sorry for this inconvenience."
2022-05-28 17:28:22.369577,MurkyPancake,ABOUT AS CLOSE AS IT GETS,"While this is the closest thing you can get to a VR mario kart. i have concerns. the UI is a bit more than rough trying to navigate. It does get a bit old after a while playing the same 6 maps unless you want to goto the advanced maps which in themselves are tough. I also kinda of feel the game is somewhat dead. like i within my first few matches i was forsure going against AIs done up to look like actual players
BUT the comfort level is pretty nice, the game feels decently put together and not some thrown together trash that some of these VR games are
OVERALL i dont know that i would purchase this again without having a friend to forsure to play with me BUT if you are looking for your mario kart VR game this is it","Dec 29, 2020 at 4:36 AM",4, 1,"Thanks for the review! We are revamping everything on the UI navigation but it will take 2-4 weeks to complete. This will be much easier to use especially the party system.

We are introducing more extreme tracks that are easy to drive such as the Slushy Slope and the Onsen track. Please give it a try and see if you like it.

We have a matchmaking preference that only waits for players instead of AI. You can use this option and keep playing offline matches while waiting too."
2022-05-28 17:28:22.384538,VRCauldron,The Kart game we've been waiting for!,"***Crossbuy is coming!**** read on...

Full transparency I did get this for free and I was kinda worried it would be bad because I gave a free game a bad review before and I felt terrible. But this game is great. For a kart game you get a real sense of speed and I had a lot of fun in the multiplayer.

The single player is really deep and there's a tonne of customisation that is all unlocked during the game for FREE yes, no micro transactions here.

It hurt them that they're getting bad reviews due to lack of crossbuy because this game gives so much value and they have put so much effort and time into it.

 I've spoken to the devs of this game a LOT and they really are putting the players first. They WILL be releasing crossbuy so if you buy it now you will get it on both Oculus platforms eventually. It's takes a while to get enabled on the store but you WILL get it eventually.

For my full review check out my video. There are a couple of niggling issues with the game itself but nothing that stops it really shining. Honestly I'm really impressed and I really want it to do well.

2022-05-28 17:28:22.400495,SemTeKx,"question, more than review","not a review as such, more of a question...
I really really really want to like this game, every review I read, or watced made me purchase it. I do already own touring karts I should mention.  Right... here goes...

I want to grab the wheel and steer with one  or both hands (uising oculus rift controllers). check,   :) nice
I want to let go of steering wheel with one hand  and grab a weapon while still using steering wheel with the other hand check  :) nice.  so far amazing! Good work . 
Now here is the Problem/Question:
for me,
The button to Accelerate is the same button that makes the hand grip the steering wheel (oculus controller trigger). So, if your holding the steering wheel, your accelerating as well!!!!!!!!!!! surely they should be independent and this is a localized glitch for me aad no one else?
Is this just me that is experianceing this? and / or Is it me that is the only one that thinks this is a terrible idea if it was ment to be like this
if this is the way it was ment to be. fair enough, but I will for sure requesting a refund.  if not please help!!!  4 starts if this is a glitch. 0 stars if it's the way the controls were programmed.  so at the moment 2 stars as, in my opinion it's only playable using the joystick on the oculus controller
cheers.... 

oh and wheres the tracks????? not many for a £20 game?

update: 
Firstly many thanks for the fast reply and explanation.  Yes I am referring to the immersive mode, as this is the only real mode i'm interested in.  I only played the game for about 20 mins as the accelerate and grip function I thought was a bug! So I am unaware that all the buttons have been mapped to something else. I will give the game a blast a bit later and let you know if there is a button I can sacrafice.  Maybe include a mapping function in the game menu?  Do you have an e-mail address I can forward my ideas to rather than here? This game has real big potential in my opinion. It  could be as people are saying The VR mario kart.","Nov 22, 2020 at 9:28 PM",4, 2,"***UPDATE1***
We plan to allow custom buttons in the future but we want to make sure we tested everything well first. (Currently, we have to handle Oculus, Steamvr, PSVR, 3 brands for steering wheels, and more)

You can email support@DashDashRacing.com and you can just remind us of your username so we can keep track.


***Original Comment***

Hi, I assumed you are talking about the immersive driving mode right?

Due to the limited number of buttons on the controller we choose to make the car auto accelerate when you are grabbing the wheel. However, we could easily make a preset for you. Can you let us know which button you want to sacrifice for the accelerate button and we will test the idea :)

We are revamping immersive mode from the ground up right now and it will be much easier to use! This should take about 2-4 weeks to perfect.

Also, you expect a lot more tracks this year and beginning of next year :)"
2022-05-28 17:28:25.483249,thejono,Best VR Kart Racer,"Easily the best VR racing game I've played and one of the best VR gaming experiences in general.

Pros
+ Beautifully handcrafted tracks
+ Tons of unlockable customization items
+ 6 comfort options as this is a very intense VR experience
+ Well optimized for a variety of PC systems as it is being designed to support the lower speced Quest as well.
+ Multiple controls options possible, including a more immersive mode that involves motion based controls.
+ A variety of powerups to use during races
+ crossplay enabled

Cons
- Some may find that 7 tracks is a bit too small, however they are very replayable and fun and more are on the way before the end of the year.
- No cross-buy option may be a dealbreaker for some","Oct 11, 2020 at 2:49 AM",5, 11,"We are going to add at least 3 tracks within the next 3-4 months along with new weapons and customizations!

Unique and well designed Tracks with such a detail. Smooth gameplay (on Rift S, can not speak for Quest here). Multiplayer wokring out well, no weird feelings when it comes to lag or anything. Great customization. Story mode, leaderboards, etc.
