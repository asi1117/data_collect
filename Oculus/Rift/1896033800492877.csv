2022-05-28 12:28:22.352603,Spy_Miro,Good game but,This game is really awesome and then I saw they released the quest version and I wanted to download it and then I saw that it asked for 19.99 which means that I don't own it because they're different games. Is there a chance you'll do something about it? Because I lost my link cable. But the game is 5 out of 5 stars,Mar 9 at 4:14 PM,5, 40,

2022-05-28 12:28:31.882514,DinoNick2009,Fun game but...,This game is pretty fun to play by yourself. The combat is pretty good aswell. But the movement in the game is not very good. You have to turn your real body to look another direction and it doesnt go very well with my corded headset because ill step on it all the time while playing. Walking is also a problem instead of joy sticks you kinda have to lunge yourself with the grip button. But other than  that this is a fun game to enjoy.,"Dec 4, 2020 at 1:03 AM",4, 83,

I sweating buckets right now! just finished final level. If you ask me about my opinion on which to get, Blade and Sorcery, or GORN, I would say get both. they're both unique in their own way. this however is a must-buy.","Nov 14, 2020 at 5:49 AM",5, 36,

2022-05-28 12:28:35.055640,Sammysky711,Very good! but it hurts my arms,Gorn is one of the best vr games the only reason it isnt a 5 star is that it hurts my arms.,"Dec 28, 2020 at 3:13 AM",4, 19,
2022-05-28 12:28:35.070600,NotTwitchKidd,B&S or gorn? Here’s my opinion,"If you’re looking for buying blade and sorcery or gorn I would recommend a lot more gorn,I had blade and sorcery and you read it correct I had it, I refund it because I found it really boring, really repetitive and well b&s feels more violent but it’s way more boring and repetitive, in B&S you choose the level and play different type of modes ( if I’m honest the “different modes”are all the same s**t)
Next let me say my opinion about gorn:
 it’s really fun and really immersive for real( I have hit the walls with my hands just trying to kill someone) the levels may look repetitive but you get and get more weapons of different types and also when you finish one floor they appear different bosses, the map changes and also the enemies , even if you finish the game you got the totally customizable level, or you just can play the game again at it’s not boring at all.
I think this is all about personal preference but I had B&S and have gorn and I would totally prefer gorn over B&S but my true recommendation is to try both and see what you like the most.","Feb 18, 2021 at 11:32 AM",5, 125,
2022-05-28 12:28:35.085560,CyborgRazor05,please add to quest,"got this game the second i saw it and loved it eversince but i replaced the rift with a oculus quest since the rift stopen one day but was sooo dissapointed to see that gorn wasen't on the quest store.
if the developers see this can you please add this to the quest.","Oct 3, 2020 at 6:15 AM",3, 78,
2022-05-28 12:28:38.187850,MeliodasTheToadus,Gorn and B&S,I like the combat of gore more than blade and sorcery because you can kinda just smash in there heads. B&S graphics are way better but it is just in too early stages to be intersting. With mods both games are better though,"Dec 16, 2020 at 1:30 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 12:28:38.202810,Motymor,Just some insane fun.,"Mutilation has never been so fun! Theres honestly not much to say about this game exept for, its fun. The enemies are fun to fight and the armor system adds some welcome complexity to viciously extracting their organs with swords, maces, spears and a variety of other weapons. The artstyle adds a nice layer of charm and makes the immense violence more fun than horrifying. I only really have one nitpick, i just wish some weapons were a little less floppy but honestly, the floppy weapons add more to the fun than they take away in mose cases. I am exited for any new content.

Pros:
+insane, fun gameplay
+doesnt take itself too seriously
+interesting art style

Cons:
-I only slightly dislike the floppy weapons
-I kinda just wish there was more

Overall gorn is pretty great and deftinately worth a buy.","Sep 12, 2020 at 7:41 PM",5, 13,

2022-05-28 12:28:44.590030,BananaPantBomb,Really just not a good game,"I had spent weeks on this game and had 20 hours of work put into it.  Then I went in and saw that my game had completely reset.     Edit: Ok.  That last part is true, but here is my full review:  This game is incredibly unfinished.  I mean, it released and everything, but it is not even close to being called a game.  The reason I had 20 hours in the game before is because I played for 6 hours at a time not progressing.  At most, expect maaaybe 8 hours for the story.  And the final misson *SPOILER ALERT*  is one big dogs*** pile.  The final mission never saves, and they decided to add this ramdom mechanic for health, which doesn't make you feel like a bad***, it makes you feel like a man dangling off of a cliff with his pinky, bound to die at any moment.  Every single mission leading up to it is easy as cake.  I believe that the devs wanted you to feel like an unstoppable force, but it just feels like you are fighting infants with an LMG.  Not much 'Bad***' in that.","Oct 29, 2020 at 9:47 AM",1, 8,

2022-05-28 12:28:50.849545,Sir.HugsForDrugs,I love every second of playing this game,"It is extremely immersive, and yes, while there are tracking issues (sometimes) all the mechanics work flawlessly, i am genuenly concerned that this game is turning me into a serial killer by this point. I was strolling in the park the other day and i saw a guy with a toolbox fixing a lampost and i saw a hammer inside his toolbox... my mind instantly went ""oh this would be a great tool for bashing someone's skull in"". I was playing and I went controller first into my PC monitor which i haven't even gotten remotely close to doing with other games like arizona sunshine or budget cuts. This game is pretty much the VR alternative to a stress ball and it just works as a college student, waking up, making ramen, and letting stress override you for your whole crappy monday just to get to play this game at the end of the day and realise ""wow, i'd really make for a good Ted Bundy when stress is all on me"". 10/10 recommended, oh and you can impale opponents and leave them to hang impaled from the big arena walls.



*UPDATE* this game is extremely gory, I mean if you didnt already know that why are you still here? But in case you are a small itty bitty child there is a low gore mode in which candy flies out of your opponents when you rip their heads off. Fun game for the whole family. My grandpa almost fainted from the physical effort he put in for christmas at out party when he played this game.","Jan 25, 2020 at 5:57 PM",5, 31,

But everytime I moved there would be these black eye things that(in my opinion) would make the game more agitating. When I noticed this I went to the settings and couldn't find anything to turn it off.

Despite that, the lackluster AI and lack of overall content keep the game from being something to play for more than a few hours or once every now and then.  Adding lots more progression content (currently 3 floors, needs several more if they go this route), converting the game into a fun gladiator management sim where you can participate, or just adding better local multiplayer (better control as the non-VR player, etc.) - any of these 3 routes or I'm sure other ideas would give the game some ""legs"".

You will have enemies constantly coming at you from all sides which is dizzying. The combat system is very clu ky too. picking up weapons and holding they is way more difficult than it should be. Watch some videos and you will see the weapons bend like they are made out of rubber and most of the time you pickup a weapon you end up holding it all wrong. upside down or even backwords.

The movement: Yes, it's a bit wonky at first but with a little patience I got used to it, and with a few selections I was able to modify them to my liking. An insult*? FFS get a grip.
The gameplay: Love it, the warriors rolling around like ""retarded monkeys*"" is what makes the game for me. I lose it so hard sometimes I actually get creamed by a warrior I didn't spot. This game is hilarious to play and at the same time I'm able to feed my aggro side. It's almost like being a hybrid of the Joker and Wolverine. 
Changing the blood and gore setting to nonviolence is brilliant. Instead of chopping and smashing the ""retarded monkeys"" I get to smack them around until I see some lollipops! I hate having a game that I can't share with my kiddos, with that setting alone I can. Thanks for making that option available.

2022-05-28 12:29:44.743610,sephethus,Great Potential Needs Work,"First the positives:

I really like the concept. I like the idea itself. I like the crowd of heads. The animation style. The weapons. The gore. The PVP and Solo games. I like that you can put your hands up to signal end and begin like you would if you've won any battle. I like the option controls in the lobby room. The levers. Even the movement is kind of cute, dragging yourself around like an ape though I turned this off because it's slow... It's all really going to be neat. All that gets 4 stars but would get 5 if...

Ok I realize this is a pre-release beta situation. So that's why I'm giving it a lot of passes on this stuff because I hope they improve all this.

First off, this game should cater to the Oculus Touch. I don't think they have a handle on those even if it says that's what it's for.   

1. The grasping of things is just plain buggy and broken. It sometimes gets reversed where pressing the grip and trigger buttons opens the hand and letting go closes them, or grasping a weapon is backwards.  
2. Grabbing weapons or levers is really badly tracked because I can aim for the mace handle but it just won't grasp it and pick it up. It takes several tries despite being right on target.  
3. Your own arms and hands are invisible, hands only sometimes, like when you're grasping a weapon. I think it should show everything, like Lone Echo, Vox Machinae and other games do. As cartoonish as this game is, the immersion would be better.
4. Punching rarely works. I can be a perfect aim but it won't register that I've punched the guy in the face repeatedly. 
5. I figured out that if I get hit once, I'm out unless I knock them out before losing consciousness. This seems odd to me, because it doesn't happen to the opponents, but maybe it's only part of the AI solo games.
6. The match starts slow. I see the typing on the chart that unrolls but it'll just sit there for a while and then finally continue. Speaking of the typed text on the scroll, voiceovers would be better.","Oct 15, 2018 at 3:09 AM",4, 6,

2022-05-28 12:29:47.916717,Chiives,"Annoying bug, lack of guidance","I love the gameplay and trhill of this game, and I only really have 2 complaints. One is the lack of guidance, because it took me a while to figure everything out, when they couldve easily explained all the mechanics, and the other is this annoying bug yhat ive been coming across recently. That bug is that almost every time I hit the Oculus button on the right touch controller, whether it be on purpose or by accident, the game crashes. This has gotten very annoying, and hope its fixed soon.","Aug 27, 2018 at 2:17 AM",4, 22,"Hey, I believe that that crash issue is fixed now, sorry for the inconvenience!"
2022-05-28 12:29:47.934670,supatrupa,Mindless Fun,"This 'game' is utterly pointless with next to zero learning curve and basically one environment. That said, for some reason it stays entertaining for hours figuring out different ways to slice and dice the incompetent baddies.... really stupid and yet really fun. $20? Not sure... but I did play it for a couple hours straight after purchasing and I will definitely be back for some blowing off steam in the future.","Oct 24, 2018 at 12:47 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 12:29:47.950627,CheesyMcGriddle,Small Space? No Worries!(w/Note to Devs),"When I first tried Gorn it was last year on the Steam version, however I had a much larger (Garage Sized) play space so it was easy to get lost in the game without fear of hitting anything, fast forward to today and ive moved and my play space is significantly smaller, it is the ""Optimal Size"" according to Oculus, however I have 2 counters on both left and right from me so I cant really venture out of my Chaperone boundries to much, which for most games is not a problem, this game however I was so worried based on my previous time playing it that It would be a major issue over head swinging just to smash my hand right into the counter.

NOPE NOT AT ALL! The developers have done an ABSOLUTELY AMAZING job accomodating small play spaces, with both the ability to walk and rotate with the controllers joysticks I can literally go all out in game without needing to move much at all in the real world, having a smaller space has not dappend my experiance. And also that ability to turn on ""Strict Chaperone"" is also a highly appreciated feature, as anyone who has played Gorn knows, when you get in the zone, your IN THE Zone lol, so to have the game pause if you reach out of the play space, only resuming after a breif countdown when your back in, is amazing!

NOTE TO DEVELOPERS: All that being said, the 1 things that I would love to see as it would make the experiance even better, would be to have the ability to adjust the quick turn radius when using the joysticks, currently its set to a default number (which feels like it may be 45deg, im not sure), however having a slightly smaller turn radious option would be very welcomed!

Love the game, this is my GO TO party game when I have company!","Sep 2, 2018 at 9:25 PM",5, 9,

There are tons of weapons to choose from and tons of champions to beat and once you have finished beating the champions you can go to the custom game and mess about with that, for example i like to increase the knockback and damage and turn into one punch man :) Definetly worth the money if it seems like your kind of game","Aug 31, 2018 at 7:55 AM",5, 9,

The game will also crash if I take my headset off and put it back on. Other then this bug the game is great and the movement can be clanky but i have gotten ussed to it. You can also switch the movement type in the game to the joysticks whoch are a lot smoother to use.","Aug 29, 2018 at 4:02 AM",5, 7,"Hey, I believe that that crash issue is fixed now, sorry for the inconvenience!"

Its more polished than most of the games I've played in VR and it makes you want to come back for more. A word of warning though...Know where you are in your room.

2022-05-28 12:29:54.222076,UglyFish819,Very buggy and a bit booring,"The default locomotion, which is swinging your arms while pressing a button is so terrible its insulting that they even put that in the game. This is enhanced by the fact that there is vey little guidence in the game, and you have to move to get to the game settings, but the default movement is terrible.

Initially the game seems fun, but then you realize that there are a ton of bugs. Weapons do not hold in your hands correctly and many are difficult to use. The enemies often just flail around like retarted monkeys. And in the end you end up just wacking them in the head with a ax or mace like some kind of human wacka mole game.

Quickly this game becomes repetitive and booring. I will be asking for a refund, while it seems fun at first in the end there is very little replay value , and this is little more than a buggy game with bad graphics and booring play.","Aug 30, 2018 at 11:30 AM",3, 9,
