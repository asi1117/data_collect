Following points need to be improved:
-the desert is too bright not good for the eyes
-the control of the vehicle ist not so good
-the biggest problem for me is the motion sickness","Sep 28, 2020 at 3:23 AM",3, 0,"Dear Shaorin,

Thank you for your comment ! 

Regarding the motion sickness/wagon control, it might seem challenging/impractical at first as there is no ""traditionnal"" introduction. But it's a game in which you develop skills through time, getting more experience with this wagon/airplane. When you do get better, getting around this open world and defending yourself against foes is much more fun and satisfying. One hint I could say is that you have to see the direction arm as a big controller joystick (mimicking an airplane handle). It's very sensitive but that's what allows you to move/turn quickly while defending your chickens. 

Sincerely,

Marc"
