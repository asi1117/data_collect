2022-05-28 18:03:50.506092,BlexBlames,Awesome,This was one of the best expiernces i have had on vr. Narrator was kinda cringe but very cool to explore. And FREE,"Dec 30, 2020 at 11:53 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:03:50.521052,Stunning Wheelchairguy32,Sound issues,"For me there is sound but it doesnt play in the headset, instead on the laptop.","Mar 23, 2021 at 6:13 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 18:03:50.536012,Regomar,,The narrator talked down to the viewer and treated the viewer like a child. It would be better if the narrator script was rewritten.,"Oct 15, 2020 at 11:33 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 18:03:50.551970,HarbingerThrace,LOVED LOVED LOVED IT,So cool to be able to 'see' the universe in all of its wavelengths and to see its history.  Educational and super fun.  Will be telling everyone about this.  Please do more of these!!! =),"Jun 14, 2020 at 6:33 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:03:53.694564,StormRising,Relaxing Entertainment,"What more could you ask for? Sit back, relax and let the entertainment begin. No jerky movements, loud surprises, or awkward infaces to deal with. I recommend it to all ages. Great introduction to VR as well for beginners.","Apr 27, 2020 at 8:31 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:03:53.709524,RocketOfDoom,Loved it!,"I reeeeeeally enjoyed this movie/game. So beautiful. 
You have 1 free story about Big Bang  and 1 payable story (2€) about the types of light rays. 
Both of them were great. Personally I think the cosmos one was more amazing to watch but I enjoyed and liked both of them. 
If I had to point out something to improve is that while you are playing in the cosmos movie, you can see your virtual sort of manly hands and I think it breaks the magic because first of all; you are in the middle of the cosmos so seeing your own hands isn't very realistic, and secondly; if you are a woman those manly hands feels a little bit awkward to be honest. x) Maybe they could choose a more gender ambiguous hands. 
Also, it would be very nice if it could be translated to other languages. I'd love to show this to my family but sadly they don't understand any English. >_<
Overall, I highly recommend this educational stuff to everyone! :D","Jan 21, 2020 at 8:44 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:03:53.724484,Omnipotency,Great Intro to VR or Astronomy,"This app is a wonderful way to introduce either VR or Astonomy (or both) newbies to the subject.  

It's interactions are limited to a few key moments that aren't time sensitive to allow for those not quite familiar with controls.  With that in mind, it allows people to look around their surroundings, which are quite intricate in some scenarios.  Feels like every time I run through it I find something I missed the last time.

From the Astronomy/Science standpoint, it's spot on with current understandings and somewhat like an interactive ""How the Universe Works"" episode.  As a science nerd, I really enjoyed the story as it played out.  If you've got an inquisitive child (or an obstinate adult) that you know, this would be a great demo for them.

Overall, the episodes are short, but a good value for the price point.  The devs aren't over reaching here.  For the few bucks it'll cost you, this is a great addition to your VR library!","May 31, 2019 at 10:04 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:03:53.738446,FastLawyer,Big bang,"It does feel like a lecture sometimes and the narrator is trying to be a cool, hip instructor / narrator but comes off like a corny dad instead. However, the experience is otherwise very good. Ideal for anyone interested in the cosmos and a brief history of our universe and planet. I've definitely seen it done better, but pretty good production values nonetheless. I'm interested to see how the second upcoming episode goes.","Mar 18, 2019 at 12:21 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 18:03:53.753406,utopman,A great VR experience,"This app made the job : I travelled in my mind with the narrator through the time and space. What is said and what is displayed looks to be done with love, sincerity and wisdom. This is something I greatly appreciate from story tellings. What's more, even if this is not top notch AAA graphics, the rendering is consistant does the job and is simply immersive. For a free app I think it's a really great job. Thank you creators.","Apr 18, 2019 at 5:29 AM",4, 2,Thank YOU utopman. You nailed it; definitely created with love and sincerity.
2022-05-28 18:03:56.844140,Chadd-Westland,I enjoyed It : ),"I believe in God not the big bang, but still it was well done and free, which is good : )
I only wish there was more none violent content., VR has gone the same way as video games, probably just a reflection of our world, or it it the other way round now ?
God Bless","Apr 30, 2019 at 5:54 AM",5, 0,"Hi Chadd, I think it's really cool that a self-proclaimed believer could still give an experience about the natural, scientific cosmology five stars!! It says a lot about you, the experience, or hopefully, both. I don't see why a belief in God, as you put it, needs to be in conflict with the story of the universe. As far as I can tell, it's all part of the same awe-inspiring story and I'm just grateful for a chance to be a small part of it.

And by the way, we agree, too much violence out there in general. That's why we create non-violent experiences. Maybe some fundamental cosmic amazement can help ease some of the anger and fear that people feel."
2022-05-28 18:03:56.860097,Angelina Starr,Geared toward 5th-8th graders,Just not something an intelligent adult would find interesting but I think it would appeal to middle schoolers.  Information presented is very low-budget and it sounds like a high-schooler talking to some grade-schoolers.,"Mar 8, 2019 at 1:00 PM",2, 10,
2022-05-28 18:03:56.875057,Dagoneti,A Great Cosmic Nightmare,"I have always been facinated by the cosmos, while its also been the stuff of some of my worst nightmares. The breathtaking beuty, and the scary places near a hostile planet or sun, that you get to behold in this app. While i loved all moments of the journey through time, it left me wanting more details. A Big bang of a start, that hopefully evolves into something truely,... Marvelous!","Mar 28, 2019 at 4:35 AM",4, 2,"Hi Dagoneti, THANKS for the thoughtful feedback. Yeah, some places and times in the universe certainly are inhospitable to humans. Makes me feel lucky to have evolved on such a precious planet. Hopefully we'll be able to make more Oika VR experiences to deliver on the details you seek."
2022-05-28 18:03:56.891014,Richooal,No Sound,There is no sound at all for me. It's the only app I've had this problem with. Makes for a looooong wait between scenes.,"Apr 23, 2019 at 2:24 PM",2, 3,"Hi Richooal, Sorry to hear that, sounds like a configuration problem (no puns intended). If you can share some info about the settings of your system, perhaps the community can offer some guidance. Let us know if you can't get it sorted out and we'll see if there is anything we can do on our end."
2022-05-28 18:03:56.905975,Plurr,,"I've tried the first video as it is the only thing available so far. It was a nice, ""low-budget"" presentation about life and our planet. Neat vistas, but the visual quality was somewhat limited. Things took a somewhat ideological in the end, but nothing too quirky.","Mar 24, 2019 at 10:39 PM",3, 3,"Hi Plurr, Thanks for the constructive feedback and you're right, we definitely produce these with a low-budget (but high-effort). And to your point about ideology, that's not what we're about. So your point is well-taken. It's always hard to find the right balance between storytelling and message.  I'll try to tone it down."
2022-05-28 18:03:59.981748,skribog,,Very good and beautifull story =),"Apr 26, 2019 at 7:24 PM",5, 1,"Hi skribog, thanks for the positive feedback.  We agree! It IS a beautiful story and we hope to keep telling more and more parts of it."
2022-05-28 18:03:59.996708,Dragonbait,,"a great visual narrative, with new stories to come.
highly recommend checking it out!","Mar 17, 2019 at 10:29 PM",5, 4,"Hi Dragonbait, THANKS for the positive feedback! We're working on the next experience, ""In the Light of the Forest"" now and should be launching this Spring (2019)."

2022-05-28 18:04:00.030618,ToriMW,Contemplative VR that inspires wonder,"I love it when VR creates a contemplative space and this is a great example of that, giving pause for thought and reminding us of the magic and majesty of the universe. I think this would be beneficial and enjoyable for all sorts of people, from school children to curious adults who'd like to be taken out of the bubble of everyday life and reminded of the wider world we're all a part of. It certainly added a dose of wonder to my day.","Mar 9, 2019 at 2:00 AM",5, 12,
