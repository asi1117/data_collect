Thank you very much for trying out the app. As we mentioned in the description, this is a collaboration application that you need a few players to work together. It is a basically a virtual meeting room to replace a telepresence robot (https://static.bhphoto.com/images/images500x500/double_robotics_1011dr_double_2_robot_1479134730000_1288972.jpg)"
2022-05-28 18:21:44.958317,alan.ryden,Nothing happened,Installed and tried to start. It crashes and you end up back at Oculus Home Screen. I assume a major bug somewhere! Also tried reinstall. No difference. One point I noted is that only 58MB install file size yet it says 2.1GB required. After installing it is still fairly small (180MB or so).,"Feb 10, 2018 at 2:06 AM",1, 2,"Hi Alan, Thank you very much for trying out our app. and we are sorry that the app crashed on your setting. What kind of hardware setting do you have (CPU, GPU, etc, laptop/PC). Would you please share your crash log from (C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\inlight-interactive-inlight-spark) to info@inlight.ai?"
