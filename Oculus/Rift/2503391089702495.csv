My Initial Impressions:
This turned out to be quite interesting and fun, a lot better than I was expecting to be honest and I certainly was not expecting the progression in the game.
My only gripe is.... In VR I have 2 hands, why can't I use both hands to model the clay?","May 7, 2020 at 8:53 PM",4, 25,

My only ask would be to enable the right hand for an even more realistic experience,  Good job!","Jul 5, 2020 at 11:41 AM",4, 1,
