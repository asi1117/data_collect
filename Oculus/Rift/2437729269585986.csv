2022-05-28 18:12:45.205961,Alicia_Wonderland,Am I missing something?,"A long period of audio only with a black screen just saying “Please return to your seat.” What seat? How? I pressed A and nothing happened. I looked around but saw no seat, just darkness everywhere. So finally after a long period of darkness, a super short kinda cool sci-fi scene. I don’t get it... The dialog seemed interesting but I was so busy looking for a seat that I missed most of it, but it seemed a bit dated talking about 2020 as if it was the future. Very confusing but could be interesting if there was an update.",Jan 22 at 9:16 AM,3, 3,

2022-05-28 18:12:45.239870,QueenVictory,,I really loved the aesthetic of this piece. The message was also very powerful. The world needs more AfroFuturism and I hope we see more stuff like this. I just wish it were longer. I would love to spend more time in this world! I hope to see more experiences from the creators.,"Aug 25, 2019 at 1:27 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 18:12:45.255828,XtremeHardcoreGamer,It's Okay.,"Unique short art project/experience that is free. I didn't get it and it did nothing for me emotionally. It's not for me. It's about on par with other mini experiences in the Oculus store though. 

Definitely nothing offensive about it. Someone said it was 'sexist and racist', so I was on high alert for that and found nothing of the sort. I'll spoil it. You sit in a beauty salon with black women. That is what reviewers are upset about? Another reviewer got 120 helpful votes and cries about ""Social Justice Warriors""--- why are these people brigading a small art project?","Apr 9, 2019 at 8:12 PM",3, 33,

2022-05-28 18:12:48.412385,fricknPoltergeist,Creative idea! Love it,Forget these bitter reviews they're sourced from the narrow-mind zombies of the narrow valley. The experience was unique and had a cool idea for a transition the wide open landscape. No technical difficulties either.,"Mar 10, 2019 at 6:54 AM",5, 11,

2022-05-28 18:12:48.459261,theCuttlefish,Nice start to an art project,"It's pretty short, but the idea isn't bad.  I think the general audience (myself included for the most part) won't understand what it is trying to say.  The bad reviews getting upvoted on here are nonsense and should be ignored.  The only part I really didn't like was the 3DOF head tracking.  It will keep telling you to move back in the body in stuff like the Rift.  Even turning around my head moved outside of the area it expected me to be in.","Aug 21, 2018 at 11:28 AM",3, 14,
2022-05-28 18:12:48.478209,nightcat.mau,Soul Soothing,"I never thought I’d talk about anything related to VR as empowering women, but this beautiful experience does it. And to have so much information passed on in such a short space of time! This concept makes me long for it to be a full experience. Women need more soul-nourishing works like this in the current wasteland that idealizes violence and male dominance it is so soothing to enter the sacred haven of the salon and just be. And that it nourishes African American women who have so little representation in VR or gaming in general? Perfection!","Jul 26, 2018 at 7:22 AM",5, 19,
2022-05-28 18:12:51.595870,sumakproductions,We need more pieces like this in store!,"I first saw this piece at SxSW in 2017. I ran through it twice then and twice now. So glad to finally see this piece in the store. I always wonder when really fun VR experiences that do well at festivals, like this one, will make it to the store.  

The music, the thoughtful design, and the world building in this experience are awesome. My only complaint is that I wanted to spend more time in the world! Which is one of the best complaints a dev could get, in my opinion.","Jul 26, 2018 at 12:14 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 18:12:51.610830,GangstaClo,"What a unique experience, I want more!","I went through it twice, I really enjoyed the graphics and the unique setting. There is no other content out there like this and I've been playing in vr for years. There's definitely a reason why this has been winning awards and making noise in the media. The potential for this to be a really cool series exploring the 'free experience' with a nsaf perspective and the technology has me intrigued and leaves me anxious to see what happens next.","Jul 19, 2018 at 3:14 AM",5, 17,
2022-05-28 18:12:51.625791,CELLARPAPER,i loved it!,"i've played this a bunch of times at art installations and i was so excited to download it and play it at home. it's such a unique and awesome experience, one that really pushes feminsim and speculative design to new limits. it's also so rad that it focuses on afro-futurism and women.","Jul 19, 2018 at 10:08 PM",5, 13,

2022-05-28 18:12:51.654713,FastLawyer,Unbiased review,"So unlike jutjut, the Trumpster whose review is just filled with buzzwords who gives you a biased review because it wouldn't matter if this game was good or not, because you know like most Trumpsters, all they have is hate for anybody not like them, I can give you an impartial review.  This is not a good game. It's not an interesting experience. It's not a good use of VR. However, it does have some merit. I could see what they were going for. But I could also tell this was a a dev who doesn't have much experience in VR. They basically had a scene in mind. But it wasn't fully developed. I thought it was an interesting idea. It just went nowhere. I would call it totally experimental. I don't think it's worth the download unless you just want to show your support for what I hope is a first time dev. I hope they learned lessons from this experience to make it a better one in the future. It's not easy to make a game or an interesting experience in VR. In the end, this just went nowhere, but at least it was an original idea. I think it was probably rushed. It needed to be better fleshed out. So dev, if you're reading this,  next time, think about how to engage the player better into this world. Make the player a participant in this world, that's the real magic available in VR.","Jul 18, 2018 at 4:40 PM",2, 34,
2022-05-28 18:12:54.746444,jutjut1134,A flaming dumpster of wasted time,"Poor animation, almost no use of VR, oh and no plot line. Terrible. A 5 minute video of sitting in a barber chair listening to propaganda for some reason that isnt clear. But hey you get this swooping video sequence which showcases the tech the devs didnt develop well. 7 minutes of life wasted for one 30 sec vr sequence that was replaceable and done better. booooooooo Social Justice Warriors have no business making VR. Just Stop it already.","Jul 18, 2018 at 9:43 AM",1, 147,
2022-05-28 18:12:54.762401,Nuthor,,"It's just sexist and racist.

2022-05-28 18:12:54.776364,autocrat.numero.uno,It's unique,"Have been paying attention to VR since it's inception and I have explored the Oculus Store on my kid's headset.  I have never been on such beautiful/trippy voyage.  At last, some diversity delivered in the form of interesting women of color as main characters/protagonists.  The setting is unique. The classic hair salon where women share secrets and aspirations, becomes a parlor of optimization for change and dreams.  The science of the Octavia Electrodes takes us on a gorgeous voyage to a place both long past and far future.","Jul 31, 2018 at 9:26 PM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 18:12:54.791324,myers.nicolas,Thought provoking and different,Finally a VR experiment that actually tries to push the boundaries of this new medium. Games are fine but the potential to bring to life new narrative experiments are amazing. This project is a perfect example of this new genre being explored in a creative and thoughtful way.,"Jul 25, 2018 at 12:09 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 18:12:54.806284,Matthew1280,More controlling female dominants,"Ok ok we know these people have gods complex and there should not be no men in the world but for slaves because these god complex people want to be in control of all and be constant nurtured like babies .
OMG Get Rekt im not changing your diapers eww would not want no one to do it for me .","Aug 9, 2018 at 12:06 PM",1, 24,
2022-05-28 18:12:57.898014,TMVRTX,,Beautiful work. Excellent idea. Amazing to see more representation of people of color in the VR world. Such a beautiful alternative to violent + male dominated works.,"Jul 20, 2018 at 11:50 PM",5, 15,
