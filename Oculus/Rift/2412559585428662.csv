2022-05-28 18:51:59.993773,DeemanInSpace,Wow ! Update is a hit !,"i forgot about the game months ago because it just wasn't much fun, you could hardly win and the immersion was relative. But now not only the administration optics is extremely improved, but much more detailed and really cool. I happened to see the update and I have to say that it's no longer just any fuzzy racer, but is developing into a real race game. Above all, the steering with the body, which is very similar to motorcycling, was very successful.
Music is awful but can be toggled off and the engine noise is a bit embarrassing for such great graphics! But I have the impression that the developers have found exactly the sense for how the game really rocks! Carry on Great!
That's the way to work in the VR world, develop and improve things, thanks !",Feb 10 at 5:30 PM,5, 0,

And that coupled with the SFX, ouch!

The sound here really hurts the success of this title in a BIG way.

Custom soundtracks would be very much welcomed.","Jun 22, 2021 at 8:52 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 18:52:00.024690,Skyhawk613,Amazing but...,"This is an amazing racer Wipeout style. (I love Wipeout) 

Developers please don't give up on this amazing racer!
This could be better than wipeout if you add shortcuts and more dramatic tracks (going up and down a skyscraper overlooking a city for example) With good graphics, you'll have a winner! I truly recommend to any wipeout fan!","Dec 28, 2020 at 11:26 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:52:00.040647,stcooperr,Initially fun but lacks replayability.,"It's a fun enough game if you liked Wipeout 2097. It has many similar game elements and there's plenty if tracks to race, two modes (time-trial and battle mode) as well as a free-race mode.  There's  decent degree of tactics involved for this kind of game (You'll soon work them out) but with no real ' campaign' mode or any way to upgrade you bike, it goes nowhere, albeit very, very fast.  It's a great trope that deserves to be re-invented for VR but it doesn't live up to it's genre's predecessors and nothing about it really stands out at all.  After about 5 or 6 hours you'll be uninstalling it to make room for something else.  Shame, really.","Apr 10, 2020 at 1:58 AM",2, 4,"We've listened, and with the recent MEGA UPDATE we've worked on providing more depth to the whole experience, with engine upgrades, bikes, suits and helmets to unlock, a career mode, and a total revamp of the menu system."
2022-05-28 18:52:00.055607,EvilFlow,No other game like it.,"Awesome original game that has very good game machanics. Leasderboards, multiple tracks, weekly challege, etc... I though I would get VR sickness with this but I don't... Amazing game.","Apr 13, 2020 at 1:05 AM",5, 3,
