2022-05-28 20:02:56.774944,MattSamiA,Devs HELP! - Game is broken cant play,"Update: Guys the Devs have actually so far been great. I have sent the information required along with videos, specs and pictures. THEY ARE TRYING TO ACTIVELY HELP! Which is awesome. Issue still not resolved for me, but I can say they are really looking into it. PLEASE dont put this game off your radar yet, as it is seriosuly amazing from what I have experienced so far. But I just need to somehow get the broken part resolved.

And thanks Devs for the fast replies.

Update: Tried absolutely everything now. Uninstalled and reinstalled the game. Changed guardians. Changed sound in case that had some weird effect. But this game is BROKEN on Oculus. You can ski down the mountain fine, shoot guys, run, but as soon as the start level wants you to pick fruit it WILL NOT BREAK OFF AND THERE IS NO WAY TO CONTINUE FROM THIS POINT. I havew watched 20 Playstaion reviews and I can clearly see how easy it is just to gran the fruit and it comes off. I have submitted help to your website and here. Still waiting on a responce. Otherwise this will be a REFUND + Letting all my VR friends not to touch it. Its broken. And yes im annoyed, wasted a day trouble shooting your or Oculus NO PLAY bug.

Hey Devs, this game is amazing. I know its been on playstation but the port to Oculus is incredible. I want to actually give this 5 stars. BUT, 1st mission still in learning after escaping the landslide you want me to pick fruit. No matter what I do, grab it, shake it, swing it, stroke it like my cok.... It will NOT unpick! I've tried shooting the thing. Everything! I am stuck at that point and cannot pass (10 mins or less into the game). It seems there is a 3 second timeout that the plant gets released. I can stretch the hell out of it and it wont pick. Please fix, this seems like an awesome game. I dont want to refund it over a bug. The tutorial words simply state, grab and hold.",11 days ago,1, 14,"Hello, We are terribly sorry to hear about this experience and thank you for bringing it to our attention.
