2022-05-28 17:48:13.218999,Captain_Howdy,a nice tour of the iss,"Since the other reviewers already told you almost all there is to know, I will add this ""juicy"" little detail (hehe), when you enter the station in the Columbus module click on the laptop, you will be treated to a big high def camtoe.... lady... wear a panty liner for heavens' sake, will ya, there may be kids watching and you may traumatise them forever

Also, hail Paxi, beloved emperor of the ""people"" of Zeta Reticuli C

2022-05-28 17:48:13.233960,Kenny8800,Controllers are switched,It is a little confusing using the touch controllers since they are switched in the VR experince. But good picture quality. But It would be nice to be able to float around in zero gavity.,"Oct 21, 2018 at 9:37 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 17:48:13.249917,Aetherius,Very interesting and educational,I was bored one night and wanted to check this out. It is very interesting and educational and give you a first person look at the ISS with 360* image and videos. After exploring the modules for about 10 or 15 minutes and watching the videos about specific items for the ISS you will start to feel like you are there for just a moment. It was certainly worth the time to experience this! Thanks.,"Apr 18, 2018 at 4:35 PM",5, 7,"Hey Aetherius, thanks for this review. We love to hear the feedback, especially when it's so positive and insightful."
2022-05-28 17:48:13.266871,Adrianus1996,Seamless work,"Made by fans for fans. It's pretty obvious this title won't suit everyone, but if you're space buff, you will love it. Plus it's free, which is stunning especially for me who paid fistful of bucks for Everest VR and got almost nothing. Here you receive more than two hours of pure fun.","Mar 26, 2018 at 4:21 AM",5, 5,"Thanks Miczowicz! 
We're really glad you liked it. If you want more VR fun, be sure to check out other the cool projects that we're currently working on, in particular - Trains VR."

While the height may not be adjustable, the picture quality's great! Thank you for this!","May 16, 2018 at 5:57 AM",5, 6,"Pictures are indeed of amazing quality DrHeroMasta. Also, who wouldn't want Samantha Cristoforetti as their science teacher?!"
2022-05-28 17:48:16.417444,DrHobo,Out of scale.,"I seem to be out of scale in this program, being very tiny with the floor and walls so far apart and my controllers are gigantic.","Mar 25, 2018 at 6:52 AM",2, 2,"Hi DrHobo, thanks for the review. When it comes to the scale, you have to remember that taking and obtaining these photos was a very challenging task. After they were sent here from the skies, we had no effective way of rescaling them or making any substaintial changes since they're all 360°."

2022-05-28 17:48:16.464319,FastLawyer,Well ... It's not Mission: ISS,"I only recommend this app if you're really interested in the International Space Station. The whole experience is about an hour long if you want to experience everything. It's a mostly educational experience. VR really didn't bring a whole lot to the experience. If you want a good VR ISS experience, then I recommend Mission: ISS (Oculus). Also, what is up with that hair (download to find out what I'm talking about)?

This app is mostly 360 still photos of each module of the ISS. Within each module are clickable icons where you can see 2D vidoes of an explanation of some of the things done in that particular module. Most of the videos are of this one Italian female astronaut. I think there are only 2 videos involving any other people. 

The ISS is divided into the USA, Russian, and Japanese side of the modules. The experience mostly deals with the USA modules. Although the Japanese module is pretty small in comparison and there was a video on that. While the Russian modules are pretty much not explained at all (there was 1 video), although it looked like crap that Russians would make, kind of like the games on Steam they release.

Did I have fun? Not really. But I do see value in the educational experience. But if you've experienced Mission:ISS then this app is a waste of time in comparison.

Rate 3 stars because of decent amount of educational content, even if not all that entertaining / VR worthy material","Mar 23, 2018 at 2:46 PM",3, 15,"Hi Superattorney (also known as very Fast Lawyer)! 

First of all, thanks for this robust review, both here and on the other store websites, we always appreciate the feedback. From the very beginning, this project was about one thing only - to spread knowledge about this awe-inspiring technological wonder through the popularity of VR headsets."
