2022-05-28 20:14:09.756281,holyraine1,fantastic,"this game was truly a fantastic experience. the art design, the combat, the story, they were all blended together in such a great way
first, the art design:
this game is in a comic book art style and they REALLY got it right with this one. ive seen games try to capture this art style before (telltales the walking dead, saints and sinners, ect) but this is probably the best game that has managed to capture the art style correctly, it genuinely does feel like im playing a comic book whenever im playing this game. i liked it how the text was portrayed in boxes with comic book style font too, that added some nice emmersion.
the combat:
the combat is fairly good. could have been a bit better but i would say that overall it was handled right. i didnt really like how your guns pointer would always magnetize to enemies weak points, but other than that i dont really have any major complaints. thankfully it wasnt too sweat inducing like a lot of vr combat games, and you can even play the game sitting down if you want.
the story:
the story is, although pretty cryptic, fairly interesting. you dont really learn much about the games current ongoing narrative, nor do you learn anything about what happened to this town and why its inhabited by freaks. its mostly about learning about mae's life stories and how she grew up. sadly i feel like it fell into the same hole that most story-based horror games fall into, where instead of explaining everything towards the end it just gets more cryptic, always bringing up more questions than answers. one final complaint i have is how the story transitions were portrayed by reading a giant comic book instead of witnessing the things yourself. i feel like it would have been easier to internalize what was happening if it actually happened to you instead of seeing it second hand.
so overall, its a pretty good game. art style was amazing, combat was well done, the narrative left a bit to be desired but it wasnt too bad.",Feb 16 at 8:49 AM,4, 14,
2022-05-28 20:14:09.770948,Roasted,Stylish Creepy Shooter,"Entertaining game with very cool comic book presentation. I played the Rift version and then booted up the Quest 2 version and there is very little difference apart from some aliasing that is much more visible on Quest.  The combat and inventory system is fairly bare bones, and the game is very linear but the story is interesting, if very cryptic, and over all I enjoyed myself.  One complaint I have is the uneven difficulty curve.  I had a fairly easy time on normal difficulty with some occasional deaths until I hit a couple of sections that were suddenly frutstatingly hard and once I hit the ""cabin"" section, where you get the shotgun, and died 10 times in a row scraping my hand in the process, I gave up and lowered the difficulty to Easy out of frustration.  Once on easy I did not die once for the rest of the game.   So I wish there a difficulty level between Normal and ""Casual"" or that the difficult sections were a little toned down on normal.",Oct 21 at 9:36 AM,4, 5,

2022-05-28 20:14:09.801865,TonyStonks,Amazing survival horror.,"The game was spooky, the combat although slightly easy was engaging and fun. The stroy was slightly weak but i didn't care as i played it for the spooks and gameplay. The last area of the game in my opinion scaled in difficulty immensely almost out of no where but i beat it eventually and it frustrated me for a little while.
Overall a great spooky vr game and if the Resident evil 4 vr remake is anything like this then i will be happy.","Apr 25, 2021 at 4:48 AM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 20:14:12.918622,AlexanderKani,First 5/5 I could give in this store,"I have owned different VR headsets over a year now and played a lot and I mean a lot of different titles, some better than the others obviously. 

I'm afraid my grasp on the english language is too flimsy to put into words how good this game and the athmosphere is, so I'm just going to vomit out my thoughts below.

When I picked up a weapon and finally defended myself I felt really relieved for a brief while before I got the rug pulled away under my feet and went back to be tense and intrigued by what is going to happen next. The different areas you explore are beautifully horrific and the themes and enemies fought were never lacking. The visuals are very unique and helped to convey what this game was supposed to be, I'm sick of the ""realistic"" VR graphics that only a few developers could really nail so far. 

The gameplay is just great, the sound is always appropriate to what is happening, the shotgun was great fun to use, albeit a little too ""small"" in scale. The pace is amazing aswell, with more intense scenes appearing just when you feel even a shred of getting too relaxed. 

Just play it, I really do not want you to miss out on this game!","Apr 24, 2021 at 8:19 PM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 20:14:12.933582,kf2010,Could have been great if not for...,"..the SUPER CLUNKY weapons mechanics! What were the devs thinking?!
I will no longer state the obvious, which is that the ambiance and graphics are superb and the sense of scale is great as well. I will just focus on why I had to rate it a 3 instead of a 4 or a 5.

The weapons mechanics try to make combat as frustrating as possible especially when there are a boatload of enemies. Guns suddenly need reloading while you are pressing the joystick and running at the same time, and you need to use that hand to reload the gun, and in the case of the 9mm, to chamber it. And as you get all these movements jumbled up, lo and behold, you drop the gun because you accidentally released the grip button. Freaking !@#$. And the melee weapons? Well, you hack happily in a panic, and guess what? You suddenly lose the weapon! And why? It gets stuck in the enemy's body! Now this would have been nice if the enemies are commensurately adjusted to make this a hectic and yet fulfilling experience, but no! The devs instead chose to make the enemies quicker than you can even load a gun or change weapons in the middle of a fight. The mechanics is so biased towards dying that it gets frustrating rather than enjoyable especially in the later levels (chapter 5 and above). If the graphics and ambiance and production value weren't excellent, I would have given this game a 1 just for the sheer frustration it gives me.
Don't get me wrong. I had my share of difficult parts of games in over 20 years of gaming, but feeling accomplished is a lot different from feeling annoyed as well as finally relieved when this game lets you move on to the next scenario.
I want to hate it, but I will give credit where credit is due. Yes, production value is very high. And this at least makes it a 3 or average when it could have been a great game. What a bummer!","Mar 15, 2021 at 12:40 AM",3, 11,
2022-05-28 20:14:12.948542,D_K,Solid original horror title!,"Really enjoyed this game, great to have an original title that's a decent length, although its a little linear.   As others have mentioned, some of the melee mechanics can be a little flaky, but certainly not game breaking.  Some areas (like the one someone mentioned about burning dolls, there are a few of them) can be tricky and require a few goes to realise you really need to make a dash to get to the dolls, but when you figure this out you can progress steadily.  Some nice puzzles later on change the pace and mix things up.   Would like to see more/ sequel with more open style areas, a VR styled like Evil Within 2 would be epic!","Mar 14, 2021 at 5:34 AM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 20:14:12.979966,oneiros5321,Really not a great game,"This game has a few things for it...the ambiance is pretty cool and I really dig the visual style.

From what I've played it's not very scary though but that's not where my problem stands.
First, why are you so small in the game? There's no height parameters and it always feel like I'm 1 meter only above the ground.
But if it was only that, I'd give it a pass, but the gunplay is extremely poor and really not satisfying.
9 times out of 10, heading for the head with a melee weapon will end up with said weapon getting stuck in the chest of missing entirely.

And, worst of all, the game rely a lot on saving ammunition and therefore, having to run from enemies...but your character literaly gets stuck on everything, all the time.

But mostly, why are you so small in this game??

Roughly played a bit more than an hour, twice, one time on release and one time today (a few months later), thought I'd give it some time and see if I'd change my mind about it, but it just doesn't work for me.
I was also hoping that some of the issues I had with the game would've been fixed (the height, the character getting stuck everywhere), but no, the game doesn't seem to have received any support after release...or if it did, that didn't fix anything.","Nov 24, 2020 at 12:34 PM",2, 12,

2022-05-28 20:14:16.063822,morningland,Gonna Return it,"The art style was really cool and I was enjoying it for the first hour but the game got very annoying very quickly.  About an hour in, you come to this shed when you have to burn these dolls quickly to stop the enemies from spawning.  It was very frusterating, no challanging and the developers decided to put a check point way before this point. So every time you die, you're forced to play through the same area over and over just to get back to the spot where you are one shotted. It really sucked the fun out of what was a really cool VR experience at first.  Maybe there is a good game past this point, but I'm hesitant to give it much more of a chance if it's already throwing cheap game mechanics at you.","Sep 17, 2020 at 6:50 PM",2, 10,

2022-05-28 20:14:16.094739,Veare_,Very good VR game with a few annoyances,"The core concept is awesome ,innovative story deliverance, and gunplay is great. 

The shotgun is super satisfying and so is the revolver. The normal pistol feels a bit whimpy despite supposedly being an upgrade. Melee weapons are only useful in the beginning and I found myself using it less and less as the game progressed, however they have a satisfying hack and slash vibe. Throwing them is also fun but as you can only carry 1 with you, it rarely ends up being used as you can just shoot. The game is scary at points and very tense throughout.  Atmosphere is very well built and the art style compliments it. Really feels like walking around a nightmare. 

I have 2 minor gripes, these are:
1. The lighter is an essential item you use to lead the way and light checkpoints. This is a cool idea and for these elements it works well. What I dislike about it is that it is supposed to be used when shooting. When the lighter is lit you can see exactly where you're pointing, it reveals weakpoints and the gun will auto lock to them. Once again cool, but holding a lighter in one hand for the entire game gets super old super fast. The combat is still really good. I just think it could have been so much more if it wasnt restricted by this little gimic.

2. There are 3 very irritating bugs, although they dont necesserily break the game, I got super fustrated with them. The first is that sometimes when re-holstering a melee weapon, it just dissapears. When you've got no ammo this means restarting the chapter.
The second is that the lockon of the lighter doesn't work against some very late game enemies. It locks onto the wrong part of the weakpoint, meaning instead of being garunteed to hit it, its impossible. 
Lastly during the final boss theres a very common bug that allows enemies to attack you while you're unable to do to anything. I actually got the achievement for beating the boss then died to one of these enemies, having to do it mutiple times dying to the same thing each time.","Jun 2, 2020 at 6:54 AM",4, 22,
2022-05-28 20:14:16.110697,JakeBlunt,"A Short, Sweet and Spooky Experience","TL;DR - 1 jump scare and a whole lot of amazing atmospheric moments with intuitive and impressive combat and aesthetics make this a brilliant addition to a VR library. 

As someone not too keen on VR horror reliant on jumpscares, but eager to try something to get the heart rate up, I took the plunge and dove in to Lies Beneath. Controls are innovative, and the visual style is striking. It took me half the campaign to realise you can stash weapons OVER YOUR SHOULDERS! Felt very annoyed that until then I was fumbling. 

You can wedge axes, knives and melee weapons into boxes and trees to free a hand up during combat which feels AMAZING! The game's combat is tense and exciting and rewards you for sacrificing a weapon to instead hold a lighter. Dual wielding is tempting, but methodically pacing along with a knife and silenced pistol or lighter and revolver can totally change how you play. 

The game's story and atmosphere are top class, and I loved it! It will certainly stay with me for a while. Certain parts were frustrating due to a lack of clarity, but the ""A-ha!"" moment of realising what I had to do made it satisfying to overcome. Several moments had me rolling my eyes inside the HMD thinking it was going to be a generic storyline but it kept me guessing all the way to the very interesting final chapter and I loved it. 

I've held off from giving it the full five stars, as I found myself occasionally getting totally deleted in combat on Normal difficulty by enemies clipping through me, and certain aspects of the gameplay being needlessly obfuscated. But once you get into it, the game will draw you in, and keep you on edge with thoughtful, considered worldbuilding. A delightful, conscise little adventure I'd play again.

2022-05-28 20:14:19.206031,stankyboyo,Rough Experience After Alyx and Saints,"EDIT: I originally gave this game 3 stars, but after playing it for another 20 minutes and then watching 90 more minutes of a ""let's play""from where I left off, I have to give this 1 star. 

Do not go into this game thinking that you are going to get a horror game. You're goign to get a monster rush of a shooter with a ""horror"" aesthetic. After playing Alyx and Saints, I know that VR can be so much more than another wave based shooter. Which is why this game dissapoints me so much. I went into this game wanting to love it. There are three major issues that I have with the game. 

1. Combat doesn't feel right. It's not very responsive and there is no ""OOMPH"" to my gunshots or axe swings. The hit detection seems to be hit and miss when it comes to the axe as I was giving some power swings and it still wouldn't connect with the monsters. The pistol isnt difficult to aim, but knowing exactly where the gu nshot is going could be wonky. They also just seem to throw monster after onster after you. Making this more a wave based shooter in which you go along a small pre-defined path, than a horror game where resource management is necessary.

2. Pacing is just horrible. You walk along a pre-determined path, pick up some resources, light a fire or lantern for a save point, then walk into a monster closet. I got to a monser closet where enemies kept spawning and I had to grab these voodoo dolls and burn them to get to stop the enemies from spawning. It wasn't difficult, it was just tedious and uninspired. 

3. This isn't a horror game. I was expecting to go into a game that would at least give me some spooks and thrills, but that's not what I got. I got a mediocre faux wave shooter with a horror asthetic and very little interaction in terms of what I could do in the world. 

Maybe you will absolutely love this game, it seems that many people do. Just make sure that you know that you are not getting a AAA experience and you are not getting a horror game.","Apr 16, 2020 at 8:13 PM",1, 55,

But it's more intense than anything else. Very few jump scares.   And more than that, there is a real story.

2022-05-28 20:14:19.236948,Masamune5454,Triple a quality horror. one request.,"First off my request is please make it so i can put the machete over my back, or better yet any weapon. i hate choosing to throw down weapons all the time becuase i cant carry one more even though i should be able to hold it.

ALSO THE LIGHTER IS YOUR AUTO AIM AND OR SIGHT DOT. i see playthroughs and nobody is using the lighter like its supposed to be used, then complaining that there is no way to auto aim. With the lighter it will highlight weakpoints and blow arms and stuff off easy.
i want to update my review. this game is scary, it is long, and it has a robo recall like combat system. imagine if robo recall and killing floor had a baby, then a demon came by, and adopted that baby.

some say it isnt scary, but the title screen has scared me 2 times already, both so bad i had to quit the game for the day. i wont spoil it, but jeez that was the worst jumpscare i think i have had. i thought there was only one.... thing happening, and when the bodys disappeared i was like why arent they here, where, THEN BAM. same has happened multiple times in game when i turn around and run, suddenly a gate pops up and traps me and im forced to deal with the horrors. 
Sure the combat isnt scary. Its not really meant to be, its more fun filler between very intense set peices. i do love the combat, and its actually whats pushing me forward, becuase im not hugely into horror thats overbearing like this, but ill deal with it to have the fun combat. Still wish there was a more manual reload system, but they got the main thing right, and thats interaction with the guns being most important. so i actually think they did it well, becuase pushing the magazine back in is enough to keep me happy.
Throwing works good, and ussually hits where i want it to.
all around great game and i hope to see more talented stuff like this. i think this is probably too intense for some people but others will love it.","Apr 22, 2020 at 4:00 PM",5, 12,

2022-05-28 20:14:19.268863,owen.tabler,Worth while buy! Trust me on this one,"Ok so after playing many vr titles, from gorn to Alyx, walking dead, sairento, tons of others, this game is absolutely worth it.
First, it's only $30 and has much more content thatn games like Journey of the Gods (whatever it's called) and Walking Dead. I think both those games are $30. 

Lies Beneath has a great amount of content and is really fun at the same time. I won't ruin the fun but this game is really, really fun and engaging. There are a few small issues, but overall I have been playing for about 10 hours or so, and have only had a few frustrating moments.

2022-05-28 20:14:22.380663,Tylersmahaa,"Amazing game, with insane story, and...","Anyone who says this game is anything but amazing would be lying. I finished this game in around 8 hours on normal mode and I dearly wish I could relive every second! Although it is not a true ""horror game"" it is still very intense, extremely sinister and almost morbid in some parts. Also the game develoupers made the story tie around completely which really impressed me! The comic book style of the game is also truly stunning, and alothough the color sceme mostly stays the same it never gets old... Also To not spoil to much the bosses are just imaculate! If you are looking for an exilently crafted story with horror elements and perfectly comic book combat, I could not recommend this game more! Please just pick it up, I have over 200 games and this is by far my favourite!

Pros: creepy characters that never get old, a pulling in, come back for more anytime story, very good dificulty, a good amount of true horror, amazing combat and creepy very cool bosses!

2022-05-28 20:14:22.396621,RaShayRitto,Competent VR experience,"Its fine. This is more of a horror-themed action game with lots of narrative delivered through floating comic book panels instead of acting. The visual style is really interesting to see in VR, but the arcadey and questionably unresponsive combat and world interaction leaves me wanting a lot more from the mechanics. I had difficulty getting immersed because of how melee hits register and how reloading your weapon doesn't require any thoughtful physical interaction with it.  The story seems like it will be pretty cool, but I'll likely just refund this and wait for a more solid game to come around.
