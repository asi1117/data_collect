2022-05-28 20:58:18.521915,AnimeBro4Life,Needs work,"Ive played this game for 2 hours and all i can say is that it was really buggy.
the items in youre hands would dissapear if you raise your arms up to combine them with another.
the bananas would go way too far when thrown lightly.
You cant hold the bazzuka, as soon as you get it, it will fire quickly.
Everything in the store to upgrade youre vehicles are way too expensive. making you play for a long time just to get a new piece for the car that doesnt even enhance it performance.

2022-05-28 20:58:18.536875,tonyfromsyracuse,its a blast!,"Once you get used to the controls and the intitial set up process which can seem a bit clunky, this is actually a pretty fun game. I like the little worlds they have created and the eye candy that materializes in the game as you make your way around the track.  just a couple things....I dont know if its just me but I notice that the view becomes a bit washed out, I think as it switches over to something new on screen and it can seem kinda jarring as you take in the scenery and then suddenly it gets a bit foggy looking...it then gets clear and sharp but then goes washed out again. also,  and I wish there was more straight aways to sort of open er up rather than twisty turns all the time....otherwise its fun!  oh, BTW, I wish Oculus would add to the review area a ""tech issue"" box, because sometimes if someone gives some game a 1 star review you think its because the game stinks but you read the review and it turns out its because they couldnt get the game to run correctly. well, I think its unfair to review a game if theres a tech issue.","Feb 10, 2020 at 7:07 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 20:58:18.551835,wirelitesoft.dev,Needs steering set to low sensitivity,"For new comers to the game steering being this sensitive is a turn off, Suggestion: Set the steering defaults to the lowest sensitivity, then once they
know how they can change the sensitivity to higher if they wish to make it harder.","Feb 28, 2020 at 5:28 AM",4, 4,"You can adjust the sensitity and check the buttons in the configuration menu of the main menu. In any case: The best way to play with motion controllers is with the default values, pressing the elbow on some armrest and above all: Much practice."
