2022-05-28 19:23:38.562780,Dodofsrt,Amazing game just one problem,I love this game and his cool way of playing the game but one thing I'm kinda scared of dark deep water so when  the water was rising I was freaking out maybe add different stages. One without water rising?,Jan 10 at 8:44 AM,4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:23:38.576743,Cybermerlin,Awesome concept needs tweaking,I love the idea and how the interaction with the puzzles worked but the only problems I had were not being able to reset a puzzle. The ball and maze puzzle where you had to blow the ball around... I could not  adjust my position because the game starting position was halfway through my computr desk so some sort of game field adjustment wou;d help. Because of this I lost he ball to a corner and could not carry on so a method of resetting the current puzzle would be a great help.,"May 25, 2021 at 7:43 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 19:23:38.592700,Malachiel87,Super Good! Quest 2 support?,I can ask if you  can port this game also to sidequest store? or quest 2 :3,"Jan 25, 2021 at 1:13 AM",5, 6,Thanks for the review and suggestion. I've now started work on a breath-based Quest game. See https://twitter.com/JumbliVR/status/1373281098080387077
2022-05-28 19:23:38.606663,DrifterThorn,Amazing Mecanics,This was such a fun game to play. I hope to see it made into a longer game. The vibe was so creep and cool.,"Sep 10, 2020 at 6:45 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:23:38.623617,Boemkool,doestn work,doestn work,"Sep 22, 2020 at 4:39 AM",1, 2,"Please read the instructions in the game carefully and take your time with it. When calibrating it's important that you move your mouth close enough to the spheres so that they start to spin. If the word in front of the sphere doesn't light up when you make a noise then there is a problem with your microphone. Maybe you have other microphones on your computer (you can press the spacebar to toggle between the one being used in the game) or maybe you have disabled the microphone or have it turned down. I've checked to make sure the game still works, and it does. The other positive reviews also confirm it works. Sorry you have an issue with it."
2022-05-28 19:23:41.731306,AXKK116121,"Great Mecanics, Great Game","I really liked how the entire game works. using microphone to act as breath in VR. The puzzlers were verry fun and I got lost on the lower water. I loved it so much. My only wish for the game is that there was more puzzles or you go somewhere new after that, just more. Great job on making this game, If I could I would leave a tip. But it is my dad's card so I can't.","May 27, 2020 at 3:55 AM",5, 1,"Thanks for trying the game and I'm pleased you enjoyed it. Taking the time to leave a review is as valuable to me as a tip, so thank you :)"
2022-05-28 19:23:41.746266,HarbingerThrace,Very cool use of tech,"To let you use your breath in vr to do puzzles is so awesome.  Hope more games use it.  Also, I loved your game dimensional.  Keep the games coming guys","Jun 22, 2020 at 9:11 AM",5, 1,"Thanks for the review, and it's great to hear you liked Dimensional too. I've started a few other projects and am currently focused on one called Voxel Vibe. You can find out what I'll be releasing next at twitter.com/JumbliVR :)"
2022-05-28 19:23:41.761225,EchoExclusive,Absolute Genius,"Excellent use of voice input on the Rift and the puzzles are easy enough that anyone who tries on VR for the first time can enjoy but hard enough for VR lovers to try to solve. There are also enough tasks to try our ""Breath tech"" on. Fantastic work!","Feb 18, 2020 at 8:04 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 19:23:41.775188,Max_Immelmann,very interesting idea,"i like this idea a lot.  no other VR app i have uses the mic in this fasion.  it is short.  the puzzles are eay, but the idea is genuine and it is free.  you can op to donate at the end.  i hope to see more like this.

i play skyrim VR, and this might be a great idea for certain ""shouts"".  like frost breath!","Sep 22, 2019 at 5:59 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:23:41.790149,RotparJesus,OMG!!!!!!! Try this quick!,"Man O Man. I want this as a base feature in every vr game. The next time you play blade and sorcery you will wish you could blow out the candles, or use foosra da magic with your breath or something. Top notch.","Sep 23, 2019 at 11:23 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:23:44.886866,Ysiu_,Great experience experiment,"I've seen few games / experiences that are more or less old game mechanics put into VR with very little proper VR experiences though.

This is definitely not one of them. Really creative approach that results in great immersion.

I've actually got bit scared when water started pouring in and tried to work the puzzle really quick. Top notch.","Sep 16, 2019 at 6:57 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:23:44.902823,redtango5,WOW,"I was really impressed, by seeing the capabilities this kind of control can have,that could be impelemented into so many games, well done Jackson, exellent work.   this is definatly, a must try,  and see were the future is heading. top marks , once again","Sep 16, 2019 at 7:35 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:23:44.917783,Fguillotine,Awesome experience!,"Breath mechanic works pretty well, although ocarina puzzle looks a little diffcult...
I'm a big fan of Dimensional. Hope you are working on a new game/experience combining this with more classic mechanics. Great and innovative work!!!","Sep 18, 2019 at 2:03 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:23:44.931745,Mithros,"Brilliant idea, needs to catch on",The immersion of having your breath mist in front of you and being able to blow on things/affect the world around you adds a whole new level to VR.  This concept should definitely be included in other games.,"Sep 17, 2019 at 11:33 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:23:44.946706,ThetaGraphics,,"Impressive work!  In addition to the overall immersion effect, I could see these mechanics being used in games for breath attacks, like fire breathing!","Sep 19, 2019 at 1:03 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:23:48.044420,uneedpuns,very good,for its first time it is brillant the calbration needs to be set with a bar or something that you can controll more,"Sep 15, 2019 at 5:30 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:23:48.060377,Mightydjgoat,Almost passed out... :/,BUT IT WAS WORTH IT! I love the use of the microphone and amazing graphics!,"Sep 17, 2019 at 3:51 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:23:48.076335,XtremeHardcoreGamer,Interesting,"I like the idea-- I almost passed out a few times (sort of joking) trying to get my breaths to register. Kept recalibrating trying to get the sensitivity just right. I guess this is due to the limitations of using the mic as the input device. When it works it is terrific- when I first tried VR- having breath detection wasn't on my radar but seeing it in actual use has convinced me that it is pretty important. Blowing on cloth or a ball in a maze adds a little bit more immersion than not having it. I wonder what else is out there that isn't on my radar that could also add immersion.

I give 4 stars because I was expecting a nice demo but sort of got the jump scare vibe at one point. Overall though it is worth your time-- download it and check it out!","Oct 15, 2018 at 10:13 PM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 19:23:48.091295,simonindelicate,Brilliant demonstration of fab mechanic,"A wonderfully realised set of puzzles that show off the immersive effects of using the rift mic to detect breath. This really shows off the potential for VR mechanics to operate at an intuitive level - everything here behaves as it should and this really helps with presence. In a lot of ways, this kind of breath presence is a more convincing illusion than hand presence because the physical act of breathing kind of generates its own haptic feedback. When the virtual world agrees with the physical sensation of breath leaving the lungs, passing the lips etc. the effect is very powerful. Can't wait to see where this idea goes.","Sep 29, 2018 at 9:54 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:23:48.106255,Praxeos,Creative and Unique!,"The clever use of breath as a means of interacting with the environment added a surprising layer of realism. As odd as it sounds, I could envision breath becoming a standard calibration for Oculus and being used across various games and applications. Something as subtle as seeing the mist of your own breath greatly enhances the sense of reality and I'm sure it could be worked into game plots in meaningful ways. Imagine how it might be used in a horror game, for instance, to signal the otherworldly chill of an evil presence.","Oct 16, 2018 at 9:26 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:23:51.211949,suprea,,"Very interesting mechanic and definitely something that can be used in the future. A word of advise, deep breathing, fast breathing and so on can cause dizziness and also cause shortness of breath (caused by exhaling CO2 faster than the generation). I'd definitely slap on a word of warning as it may not be medically fit for someone to do some of the puzzles in the game.

In any case, I can definitely see this kind of stuff being used in stealth games or games where you're in first person and you can see your own breath (in cold weather). Sounds like a neat addition.","Oct 6, 2018 at 10:18 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 19:23:51.226908,Seri-oke,Yes!!!,"I give this review a 5 because of what it could be. Add this to all games!!! If you are doing a dungeon crawl it would add to the suspense....If you were superman you could use the ice or wind breath without using buttons...If you played as Indiana Jones you could blow off the dust of an ancient relic. 

Basically, this adds to the emersion of all games and should be a staple of what we as the VR community should have in all experiences.","Sep 17, 2018 at 7:40 AM",5, 4,"I'm very pleased to read this. I developed the short experience to inspire developers and encourage hardware companies to add breath sensors. I love hearing other peoples ideas on how it could be used and also want to see it in all experiences one day. Other ideas I have include fitness apps changing your work rate depending on how out of breath you are, steaming up a window and writing your own message for a friend to see, meditation apps where you see your own breath. It also gives a flexible input method for people with very restricted mobility - especially when partnered with eye tracking. I think one day it will be standard but I'd like it to be next gen rather than in the distant future."
2022-05-28 19:23:51.242865,TAH78,New experience,"Good idea, nice graphics and gameplay. Developer from Dimensional. Who played till end of Dimensional knows, the develeoper had already at this time the breath idea. Keep going on the good work. Already tipped. But i had some problems at the tutorial and at blowing out the candles. The environemnt was not stable and i couldn't reach all the time everything. I reconfigured sensor / sensor setup and guardian system, but there seems still some bugs. Also some problems with turning fast around - cableproblems :-)","Sep 17, 2018 at 12:14 AM",4, 0,"Thank you for the feedback and tip. Also it's always good to hear from someone that finished Dimensional :) Just to let you know, on the last challenge with the candles you don't need to turn around quickly. It's about doing them in the right order and the correct order is hidden in the level. When using the correct order you can take as much time as you like. Thanks again."
2022-05-28 19:23:51.257826,Aquavemo,Amazing concept!,"Fascinating to see how easily you can trick your brain to think you really used your breath. (thanks to the well implemented physics) But it had one downside: i got dizzy after a while. I saw a similar game on steam called ""Prana"", though im afraid the developer abandoned that.","Sep 15, 2018 at 4:09 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:23:51.271788,Splinks,Wow,"This is amazing, I really hope that this is incorporated into many games in the future. Seeing your breath is so immersive it is next level guys. Check it out.","Oct 9, 2018 at 7:48 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:23:54.354543,Outsider427,,"Just finished it... made me dizzy from running out of breathe though lol but very different use of mechanics using the mic, i enjoyed it.﻿","Sep 14, 2018 at 2:54 AM",4, 4,
