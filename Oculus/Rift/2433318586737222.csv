2022-05-28 20:49:03.830516,Blu377,the first few times.,"The first few times i played this it was magical, my friend loved it I had to fight for the headset :D. 
then some updates hit and now it refuses to stop the tutorial, 
So I tryed allowing the tutorial to run, it then gets bugged when your asked to open the bug book in said tutorial meaning the only way to shut it is to close it from the taskmaster..

*Update 28/04/2028*  the game still won't allow me to skip the tutorial or Play the tutorial still,  The tutoral asks you to open ladybird book, you do that and then nothing, the tutorial pointer remains on screen and you can't press anything to progress, 
I feel my time and hopes for this product is gone at this point.
If I can't play this game due to this bug at all then fun and ZEN of this game is gone.","Apr 28, 2021 at 9:34 PM",1, 0,"Oh no! We fixed the bug, so it really should work now. Could you try one more time to uninstall the game, and reinstall it to make sure you get the new version? If you still have problems, please get in touch at https://www.lighthaus.us/contact.  We really want to make this right for you! Thanks so much."
2022-05-28 20:49:03.845476,CmdrRiker,Great concept has gotten needed tweaks,"UPDATE 1: The previous update to the app added all 3 features I requested in my original review. THANK YOU DEVS! GREAT WORK! Changed my review from 4 to 5 stars.
UPDATE 2:  The newest update adds more scenes (THANK YOU AGAIN DEVS!) but adds to the frustration. When a string/wire of holiday lights and all the bulbs are the same single object it looks rather odd. Can't these have been split more logically?","Dec 16, 2020 at 6:32 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:49:03.860436,GreatWizard,Intuitive and fun. + some suggestions,"The scenes are all really pretty and immersive. The controls are intuitive. Kids enjoyed playing with it. 

Important feature request : Most often several people (or kids) will want to color the scenes in one household. So either allow saving a colored version of the scene into a gallery, or allow named profiles each with their own colored scenes.","Jun 16, 2020 at 5:58 AM",4, 12,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuX-STWTyxc

My Initial Thoughts:
A chill and relaxing experience that comes alive with a click and point mechanic, however I would have liked to have seen the developers take this one step further and actually allow us to use a brush to color in the worlds ourselves.","Mar 22, 2020 at 12:31 AM",3, 27,
2022-05-28 20:49:03.891353,TiggerLarue,Very cool but room for improvement,"There’s definitely room for improvement, but since I can’t give half stars and 3 seemed too low, I went with 4. Coloring can be therapeutic, so this couldn’t have come at a better time. Love the available scenes, resolution is very good, animations (especially the “Easter egg” ones) and the music add to the experience nicely. Wishlist: more expansive color palette (sometimes grey or black is good), allow coloring of smaller elements or stroke vs fill (the experience was a little less satisfying with the man fishing and the birds), allow walking through the scene (please say this is coming), give me a way to just enjoy watching the animation without having to worry about “selecting” an area that would be colored if I hit the trigger (I could do it, but had to be very specific about where I could hold the controller), give me the option about whether to color the mirror side of the mandala the same. More coloring books, please!!!","Mar 24, 2020 at 5:51 AM",4, 27,"Thanks for your feedback, TiggerLarue -- we listened to it! We just released a new build with grays, black, and a near-infinite range of colors on the new advanced pallette.  Let us know what you think and if this influences your overall feeling about Color Space! 

We have more scenes on the way, too, but it'll take a couple weeks."
2022-05-28 20:49:06.990065,mginni15,It opened but thats it,After repeatedly trying to open and close the app nothing worked. The app would launch and I would be taken to the main menu and asked to begin the tutorial but none of the buttons worked and nothing happened. I would try pressing the triggers to select a book but I would get no response as well as from the other buttons and was destined to stay in the main menu indefinitely. I was looking forward to try this app but dissappointed from a game breaking bug. I  uninstalled then reinstalled and kept getting the same issue of nothing working.,"May 19, 2020 at 11:02 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 20:49:07.005025,PappaBravo,Amazing!,"I really liked this game, it is so cool that once you color something more things may apear, like the robots ot the giant crystal structure! However I wish there was a way to slow time because some moving objects are fast. Over all I had a great time!","Jun 1, 2020 at 12:42 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:49:07.018988,FastLawyer,Every color zen,"This is a very relaxing coloring experience. You don't need any artistic talent. The minimalistic coloring mechanic makes it a zen experience. Some animations will play as you color along. It's point & click operation with paint fill operation. There's ambient sounds & music in the background. There are 13 different coloring scenes from nature, to planetary, to city scapes, to abstract patterns. 

I think it may be too pricey given the limited content. I wish you could use a brush. I wish you could mix & match colors and color outside the lines. However, as is, it's still an enjoyable experience and something that would be fun for the whole family.

2022-05-28 20:49:07.033948,Clickingtoenails,Great experience! But suggestions!,This is what I have been waiting for in VR. Couple of simple suggestions. Include the color black please. Next - Allow movement. And finally allow coloring of the small spaces independently. If these things done - 5 star keeper for sure!,"Mar 21, 2020 at 7:54 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 20:49:07.048908,Suspend,Great Low Stress Coloring Game,Tired of shooting monsters?  This is a great way to relax.  Very cool interface and lovely scenes.  My daughter just can't get enough.  We can't wait for additional scenes to come out.,"Apr 29, 2020 at 10:54 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:49:10.144628,j3steven,Beautiful and relaxing,"This is an adult colouring book in VR, and it NAILS it.  If you're looking for the full Bob Ross artistic experience, then you should get Tiltbrush. 

The environments are beautiful, and now that there are unlimited colours, I can get pretty much exactly what I'm looking for each time. I love that they come to life as you colour them. The interface is easy to understand. This is a great way to calm the mind and be creative without expending a ton of mental energy. Can't wait for more worlds to colour. Well done!","Mar 27, 2020 at 10:42 PM",5, 2,Thanks so much for your review -- more worlds on the way!
2022-05-28 20:49:10.159588,Cadwalader,You owe it to yourself to get this app!,"This is crazy peaceful and zen-like. I figured I have nothing to lose and I bought the app on a whim. I spent the next hour just trying out. Now I'm showing this app to anyone I can get my headset on! Really, ... GET IT!","Apr 8, 2020 at 1:54 AM",5, 2,"Thanks for the fantastic feedback, we're glad you like it! Stay tuned for more scenes coming soon."
2022-05-28 20:49:10.174548,Celiac112,Really Relaxing experience,"I really liked this, it's relaxing, and there's definitely replayability if you want to recolor things youve already done. I'm excited for more things to be added, but right now it has kept me busy for a little while!

2022-05-28 20:49:13.340081,taquitobuddy,"Super basic coloring, maybe for kids","This one might be fun for small children.  It is a very basic coloring app with a handful of scenes you can color in.  The basic palette needs far more colors, including stuff like glittery, metalic, color shifting, etc.  And the scenes need more livliness.  As it is, there is so little here I can't imagine recommending buying it.  Would be ok as a free app.","Apr 3, 2020 at 10:21 AM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 20:49:13.355041,RyanH290,More limited than I was expecting,"It's a cool idea and seems on the right track in terms of execution, but there are too few scenes to paint, also the scenes are almost entirely concentrated to 180°, and as said by other reviewers there are too many objects that are treated as a single 'fill' block when you would assume you could colour different parts.

I thought about refunding but I think I'll keep it and hope they build on what they've got.","Apr 3, 2020 at 12:14 PM",3, 0,
