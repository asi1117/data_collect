2022-05-28 19:51:48.858646,OpticFox26,,I really like the idea of doing this kind of game. But I found myself wishing that I could manually move the platforms instead of clicking on them and having them move to a predesignated angle. I thought I would be able to create my own paths with what was on the board.,"Dec 15, 2019 at 12:30 PM",3, 0,

You should use that explanation in the game. - The puzzles are ok, some of them are quite hard to solve. However, that wall is not very pretty, really needs a different texture like concrete or wooden planks. Right now it looks like an ugly laminated flooring. Besides that it looks alright. //Edit#2: Solved all puzzles now, most of them with pure trial and error - good puzzles should never require me to do that, its like giving up = not fun.","Sep 17, 2018 at 1:47 AM",3, 0,"You have to look (gaze) at the planks and use the controller thumb-stick push button to rotate them. Once they are in the desired position, press play. The goal is to guide the ball to the hoop down below
Edit: Thanks for the feedback. Will add a tutorial as well as review the textures to see how to improve them! Some of the levels may need a lot of ""trial and error"" to find the right combination, but they all are solvable. If stuck, let me know
Edit2: Thanks again Aquavemo for your inputs so the experience can be made better. Btw, glad you could complete all (though with lot of trials - I know how frustrating it can seem at times :) )."
