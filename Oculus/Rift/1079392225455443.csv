2022-05-28 17:30:01.598176,FastLawyer,Halloween update is awesome,"So this is basically a music experience with a stationary viewpoint of a vibrant world around you.  The normal and Halloween mode have the same basic scene, however all the details are different.  There is a day and night cycle for both experiences.  I hope they do a similar update for winter.  That will more than justify the normal price.  What sets this app apart from many others is that you can listen to your own music as well.  I was slightly disappointed that my touch controllers did not do anything, you have these wooden things as your hands but I didn't see a function for them.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed the experience and easily got my $3 worth of entertainment.","Oct 30, 2017 at 11:33 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 17:30:01.613136,Catnip2,Enjoyable,"An enjoyale fantasy travelling, pretty colour & scenery. Under $3 will be a reasonable price for this app.","Oct 19, 2017 at 7:27 AM",3, 3,

We're looking forward to making more levels/experiences for ITA in the future. Right now we're working on a new project, ""Seance: The Unquiet"". You can check out our preview (it's free) if you like. Thanks again! We really appreciate your kind words."

2022-05-28 17:30:04.771689,NAME CHANGE BITCH,Completely disappointed,"I debated buying this for a while.  I can't believe I paid for it.  I was looking for an experience I could kind of meditate and relax to.  

All I could think of was the terrible graphics and design.   The world was full of physics flaws, such as the two moons being half moons, even though the sun was right underneath them, and the comet was flying sideways even though it wasn't tracking with the stars. 

It doesn't help that the music got angry in the middle

Also, I expected more than one experience.   WTF?","Nov 14, 2016 at 2:20 PM",1, 19,

2022-05-28 17:30:04.801608,Chain200,Not impressed,"I'm glad i got this title on sale and even so I don't think it's worth the money. You can get more interesting experiences for free.
To be honest, i was bored on the verge of falling to sleep.","Dec 22, 2016 at 3:46 PM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 17:30:04.815572,frostedbuns,Too much,Too much money for what was basically a few minutes of standing on some cliff spire thing. I expected at least a few scenarios to experience.,"Dec 29, 2016 at 7:19 PM",1, 2,
