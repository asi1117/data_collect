2022-05-28 19:47:05.052594,Mach13-13,Could easily be 5 stars,"So why isn't it  5 stars just now?   Firstly I appreciate this is free and I guess that's because its a work in progress and the dev wants feedback on it.. Well there are a few things which distract and therefore detract from what would otherwise be a positive experience.  

Rather than focus upon the story I found myself trying to fix things like the video stutter and audio pops and crackles (my Rig specs are at the end of my review)

 
This is effectively a 360 movie which you can either stream or download to your rig.  I've got to say the download option is a faff, as the download stops immediately you take your headset off (and it takes quite some time to download)   I did try the streaming option first but it was too glitchy... The downloaded video appeared to be an improvement but still suffered from motion blur (when the mom flys passed in the caverns)
 I had to bypass the sensor on my headset whilst the 1.3gb movie downloaded verrrry slowly.

 I tried the lower res options but they look awful and i'm not sure whoever is going to use them...  

The audio is well done but for the constant popping and crackling that occurs spatially around you.  Its as though its suffering from digital clipping and is very distracting.

Now if these things were fixed it would be a 5 star item... The story is interesting, well presented and a novel approach towards helping us understand the impact of dementia.  That part was really quite moving.

I look forward to an update in the near future at which point id happily watch it (properly) again.

2022-05-28 19:47:05.070545,HitchRogers,Poor UX Limits Otherwise Good Experience,"The trailer video does an excellent job showing off the reasons you might want this, so I'm just going to focus on the UX issues that really need to be fixed:

If you cannot continue downloading while the headset is not actively being worn, just package the download with the executable and remove the streaming option. The download option is painful to use in its current form.

Oculus Remote support did not kick in for me, perhaps because my Touch controllers were not asleep. Please look for Oculus Remote button press when Touch Controllers are active, in case user prefers to switch controllers for your experience.

Audio popping during periods of relative quiet (like the beginning of the Desk scene) was literally painful. Lots of very loud audio pops.

Sometimes when  scrubbing (to go back and re-watch something that happened a few moments ago) decoding gets messed up and everything goes all white. Recommend forcing the player to the previous/nearest i frame.

I used only the right touch controller, and noticed that the controller's position in virtual reality was not accurate. Resetting the view helped, but it drifted until manually reset again.","Jun 24, 2019 at 4:07 AM",3, 0,"Hi there
Thank you for your review and precious suggestions. Some of the problems seem like bugs (e.g. we support download while your headset not being worn). Would you mind to send e-mail to support@veer.tv to better report them? We will need a screen recording to see what is going on. It would be really helpful for us. Thank you in advance and have a good day!"
2022-05-28 19:47:05.095479,FastLawyer,"Good story, not good video quality","This is a really good VR cinematic experience hampered by the poor 3D 360 video quality. There is a streaming and download option. Unfortunately, downloading the 1.3GB video requires you to stay in the app using your headset until it finished downloading (it pauses otherwise). The story is really good though.","Jun 8, 2019 at 4:21 AM",3, 2,"Hi there, thank you for your review.

2022-05-28 19:47:05.113432,neil.nathanson,Excellent storytelling,"I very much enjoyed this vr story. The art was great, the story was well written and the voice acting was engaging and professional.

1 star off because the download was a problem. I blocked my sensor so it would download without wearing the heasdset. It would be better if the original app download included the full res video in it so the video would be available when we first open the app.","Jun 9, 2019 at 10:02 AM",4, 1,"Hi there, thank you for your review.

2022-05-28 19:47:08.244207,Aquavemo,"Heartwarming story, but...","some things should be improved:
- it took 2,5 minutes(!) to load the menu (without any loading bar or text like ""please wait"" - first time i thought the app crashed)
- wrong controller model is displayed (rift s shows the rift controllers), and the position is off (feels like a ""go"" implementation)
- ""more stories"" just closes the app
- download is rather slow - over 15 minutes for the 1,3gb
- most importantly: the download stops when the headset is taken off! (i ended up covering the proximity sensor as i didnt wanted to sit around for 15 minutes doing nothing)
EDIT: - had the same audio problem Mach13-13 described","Jun 7, 2019 at 12:30 AM",3, 2,"Hi there, thank you for your review.
