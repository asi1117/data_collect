The marketplace in the quest is quite limited right now.But i think something like this would work great in a portable system. Works fine for me .I just wish the moment controls were a bit more flexible.But its already quite good. Instruments are fun. I think this is a great little zone to be in were you can sit around and think of a song you want to make. The app deservers 4 stars for value for money and .

Movement was confusing at first but once you get used to it it's no problem. Also, you might consider using the trigger instead of the Grip for the laser shooting.

After working out the finger mechanics for the harp that was great, having a super affordable sequencer kit is also super great!
Would love to see some haptic support put in to help users 'feel' an instrument, and work on stringing and tuning the guitar so it can run chords and base scales.
Also, MORE THUNDER AND LIGHTENING!!  :)

You can sequence music without really understanding any music theory, making it more accessible. I would like the option to make several different loops, and flick between them to form a song, aswell as change the key of the song as it seems to be fixed. The guitar is also quite unresponsive. But overall, quite fun for a mess around, and can't really complain too much at this price.","Mar 2, 2018 at 7:00 AM",3, 3,Lol yeah the guitar sucks.  It's one of those things that's just wayyyyy tooo intricate to play in Vr. I'll keep working on improving it though!

I can't imagine the sticks disappeared. They just stay where you left them.   I'll be implementing drumsticks like the timpani mallets that always come back when I release out of Early Access."
2022-05-28 18:52:24.028489,XtremeHardcoreGamer,Potential.,"This has potential, but right now it is fun to play around with for a few minutes up to an hour then never touch again-- like a toy. The price reflects this reality I suppose. The ""virtual instruments"" that try to mimic a real instrument were sort of useless and non functional. Except the harp, you won't be able to make any particular tunes with it but it was relaxing to pluck away for a couple of minutes. Real instruments require fine finger motor controls. VR doesn't have that right now. ------ Where I saw potential was with the basic sequencers. These were very basic but it was great interacting with the different modules. If they make another version, I'd like for it to be nothing but sequencers. Sequencer don't require fine finger control. Allow the user to summon and delete modules at will. Look at what many tablet sequencer apps have done, and just recreate that in VR. I know, not easy at all to do-- but I thought I'd throw that out there. I'd pay lots of money for a robust music app like that btw. One other thing I wanted to mention was the performance was pretty bad on my 4770K and Gtx 1080 system.","Jan 30, 2018 at 10:02 AM",3, 0,"Hi, I hope you get a chance to try again and see if you are satisfied.

Not to mention the laggines. And it gets worse the more instruments are playing at once.

Yeah... optimization is needed...

But I kind of liked the blues-like chord progression (I bet the programmer is a blues lover)

And btw... you totally have to be on acid to fully enjoy this... although I do not do drugs I can imagine it helps...

1 star... hmmmmm... if you can manage a latency of like 30ms it's 4 stars.. 20ms would give you 5 stars...","Jan 24, 2018 at 3:42 AM",1, 1,"Hi, I hope you get a chance to try again and see if you are satisfied. I've completely overhauled the game.

2022-05-28 18:52:24.058409,FastLawyer,Not sure what negative reviewers expect,"So I got this app for $1.49 USD on the flash sale.  It normally costs $2.99.  Either way, how can you expect a full fledged pro audio app?  I had very low expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the amount of content included in this app.  I thought it was just a few instruments and that there would only be canned sounds with very little player input.  In fact, there's quite a variety of things to play around with.  Not just drums, but guitars, keys, harps, bass, theramin, steel drums, and all kinds of synth sounds.  The drums actually respond to your velocity.  I found the drum kits to be very responsive to the touch controllers input.  The harp is also amazing.  You can pluck each string with each finger that you can move on your touch controller.  You can pluck 1 string, 2 strings at the same time or three.  With a little practice, I was able to make the harp sing like an angel.  I just wish there as a more intuitive way to record your sounds and save.  Either way, with just a little bit of music creativity, you can make amazing compositions with this app with several layers in the loop.  All for less than a good cup of coffee.","Dec 10, 2017 at 2:47 AM",5, 3,

While the composition tools are pretty limited and simplistic ( its just a looper) theres surely enough capability to let you see what this medium will be like some day. I am really looking forward to it. Even now I have the riff I composed in there running through my head.

2022-05-28 18:52:27.227931,Jordan,Basically Electroplankton VR!,"Have you ever played Electroplankton?

This game reminds me a lot of that. For those unaware, Electroplankton was a cheap, nifty experimental sandbox game where you can mess around with various chords, instruments and sounds.

This app is exactly that. Is it the next music compositional tool? Um, no.

Will you have a fun time messing around with the instruments and getting them to make funky music? Probably, if you go in with measured expectations. Like a VR Electroplankton or Wii Music, it's a nifty toy, and should be treated as exactly that - a toy to mess around with.

I have no doubt some crazy guys are going to make full songs out of this, but if you're less  less musicially gifted, you can still have a blast messing around with virtual instruments. Just keep your expectations reasonable - it's $3 - and don't expect any sort of precision. It's a game, not music creation software.

Personally, I think some sort of MIDI integration would be a fun feature - perhaps you could play along to MIDI tracks or something similar.

NOTE: This was originally a review complaining about the sound quality - there was abug where it would distort heavily and hurt my ears. The developer reached out after fixing this, and the review was edited accordingly.","Oct 11, 2017 at 10:50 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 18:52:30.393464,neuro27,So Much Fun!!!,"Really recommend this app. This is exactly what you would hope someone would make for VR. There are 6 scenes with different styles and instruments to go along with them. It's a lot of fun to drum and pluck at the harp, although you quickly find out its hard to do precise motions without force feedback. Noting that it is still in early access makes the bugs and lack of features forgivable. My wishlist: record your music; adjust individual volumes; better visuals on 8-bit world (too hard to see several things); display notes on what is played above it (such as C# above harp as example); better ability to drumroll... just to name a few. Thanks to the developer for providing such a cool app at a great price!","Jun 29, 2017 at 2:47 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:52:30.408424,cdroulers,Good job!,"(Update: all the issues mentioned below are resolved now)
Most instrument work pretty well but there are some bugs. The steel drum and the 8 bit xylophone have too much latency. The hihat pedal button doesn't make any hihat sound. 8 bit mode is awesome. It's hard to figure out how the guitar works. I recommend you to get some inspiration from VirtuoPhone on Android (for the guitar). The head position isn't calibrated with oculus home. If you start the app with your headset in storage far from the center of your room and you put your headset, your head will be far from the center.","Jun 3, 2017 at 9:23 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:52:30.424382,CoolDown89,Nice game and a fast programmer,"After the first 15 Minutes of playing it looks really good and it has a lot of potential.
Two functions attracted my attention because they doesn´t work properly.
First: The ""On""-Buttons doesn´t have any effects on each machine. Notwithstanding the above if it´s enabled or disabled.
The activated sound effects (buttons) are still playing. 
Second: The displayed value (counter) for the Tempo BPM isn´t changing after
speed it up or down.

But for Early Access it´s a good game.

#################################################################### UPDATE 05/22/17: Great job Dano, thank you. Boost up to 5 stars.
Now I found a ""visual"" bug.
At the beginning the displayed BPM-value is set to 100 but
is changing to 123 or rather 117 after pressing the UP- or DOWN-Button. 
The labels ""UP"" or ""DOWN"" on the Buttons are missing except for ""Rock and Roll Stage""
Is it intended that the ""Hi-Hat"" doesn´t make any sounds when pressing the X-Button?","May 23, 2017 at 1:20 AM",5, 0,"I see! Thanks for the find!
And yes I haven't added high hat functionality yet. That's a big update because I'm going to have a system for playing open and closed so that's coming later.
And good catch on the init value not being set! I'll make sure that happens.
