2022-05-28 18:27:37.960678,RuneSR2,Wanted to like this game...,"Admitted, I only played this game for an hour and did not pay the full price. It was fun to shoot opponents and to draw the gun as quickly as possible, but it felt repetitive very fast. Graphics are poor, just barren textures - no grass waving in the wind like in The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. It looks like a game from 1996 or 1997 due to the very low polygon count - maybe that's the price of developing for the slow PS4 cpu. It does not feel like a proper PC VR game by far. On the positive side regarding the low-end graphics, using my oc'ed GTX 1080 and i7 7700K (4.2-4.5 GHz) and 16GB 3200 Mhz ram I had no problems running the game forcing super sampling at 2.0. I have little time to spend on VR gaming, unfortunately this game did not impress me and I don't plan to spend more time on it. I'm going to ask for a refund, thus I will not be able to update this short review.","May 25, 2018 at 4:28 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 18:27:37.975638,allendixon,Great for what it is,Other reviews are right about graphics being on the low side...but it's also priced accordingly and plays nice on lesser hardware. Gameplay is where it's at here. Fun duels that slowly introduce puzzle elements and an entertaining story with great voice acting. Little on the short side but happy to see the collectible statues and minigames. Overall very happy given the price I paid.,"May 25, 2018 at 5:00 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:27:37.990598,comedybingbong,Worth it!,Really great game that surprised me. Been playing VR games since DK1 and this is one of the most challenging. It's on the short side but to me that just means I have time to play my other games too. 5 out of 5,"Feb 2, 2018 at 9:36 AM",5, 19,Thank you! Free updates with more content are on the way :)
2022-05-28 18:27:38.005558,emilito9000,Poor experience,"Some levels are too easy, and there are some crazy levels, with no chance to win. Needs some work to be a good game.","Feb 18, 2018 at 5:30 AM",2, 4,"Hey there! Our latest update includes new training games, difficulty options, and an exhibition mode where you can practice each duel. Thanks for playing! :)"
2022-05-28 18:27:41.130201,FastLawyer,Challenging gun play,"I wasn't sure about this game but I took a gamble based on the all the positive reviews on Steam.  It's definitely a challenge.  Not just in solving some of the puzzle elements, but in being quick and accurate on the draw.  I thought this game would be your standard gun draw game, but it isn't.  There's a lot of story here and the puzzle elements keep it from becoming repetitive.  I'm actually stuck in one of the duels, but I think I can solve it.  When I first fought the bow and arrow elf, I thought that fight was impossible.  But after defeating that elf, I was wondering what I thought was so difficult about it.  Warning:  your eyesight/ peripheral vision, hand-eye coordination, and hearing will all be challenged to complete some of these duels.  Note: I did not like how you have to do some of the duels again after defeating them to get back to where you were.  I recommend this game on sale (I bought for $10) because of content and graphics are not the best and the bonus rounds could be better.  Definitely this is more a game for competetitive people than anything else. Anyways, Good luck and shoot straight!","Feb 23, 2018 at 2:04 PM",4, 5,"Thanks for the review! Our latest update includes a bunch of new stuff, but I think you'll be most excited for exhibition mode which allows you to play specific duels without restarting the world if you die. That mode also includes custom difficulty options--a great way to earn trophies and practice for the story mode!"
