2022-05-28 13:09:54.071354,DamnedEstra,cool story great work out,"Needles to say how fun to dance over the music but this game also has a pretty cool story and the way to open new character, the antagonist mostly. It has very pleasant character design and you kinda want to move on and on on more difficult levels just to dance with your fave but also it has some move for the desire to win and to go on. I think it costs all the cents and I would be happy if devs would work on the lore of the game more because as the dynamic gamplay the story itself tricks you to stay longer. I think it would be also cool with wins to get step by step some characters stories, parts of it so it would stay competetive to achieve","Mar 10, 2021 at 11:53 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 13:09:54.085316,Lotalu,Fun workout!,I'm trying to lose weight and when I saw this I knew I had to get it.  I'm glad I did because it's a really fun form of exercise. I like that they have different levels of difficulty and different characters to dance with who have their own level of difficulty and style. I was sweating worse that Rudy Giuliani at a press conference after playing this.  Totally worth it 10/10.,"Nov 28, 2020 at 12:45 PM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 13:09:54.116233,liamf777,Great workout Great fun,"This game took a back seat to beatsaber untill recently when i decided to go through my older games in the library. I wish i had realised earlier how great this was and it doesnt deserve to be compared to beatsaber as this actualy gets you dancing and rewards you even further if you actualy hit the targets rather than just move through them meaning you get an incredible workout on harder difficulties. If your on the fence, go for it !","Nov 24, 2020 at 6:07 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 13:09:54.131194,ZombiesWithCoffee,I bought the Oculus to play Beat Sabre,"But now I haven't played it in over a week.  This game is so addictive, fun, and frankly a bit beautiful with some of the fluid movements that you have to perform.  A bit artistic dance poetry at times to complete some of the longer strings of notes.  My go-to game when I want to get some aerobic exercise.","Dec 4, 2020 at 10:52 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 13:09:54.146154,Icedovexbox,My Favorite VR Game,"This game is awesome. My go-to-VR-Game. I love the music and the gameplay. The songs are by F-777. Check out if you like his music. To the rhythm you will hit beats and hold cascades flying to you from up and own, left and right. (Similar to what Beat Saber introduced as 90° Gameplay.)

The game is well worth getting, even if you own Beat Saber. You move your body and arms a lot more. In contrast, it requires less precision (like hitting the node in a certain direction). This makes it easier, but you will sweat nonetheless. There is also custom songs.

PS. I will get a Quest, once it gets a release there. When?","Nov 21, 2020 at 3:11 AM",5, 5,

After all this years, I have played many games with different amount of phisical activity needed. I thought I was more for the less movement ones, but that was cause I did not know Dance Collider yet. Now I have to wash my headset fabric cover almost every day.  The time for sedentary games is over, let yourself go with Dance Collider, have fun and stay healthy and fit at the same time. Now I am trying to learn how to edit my favourite songs for the game. THIS GAME ROCKS!!!","Sep 21, 2020 at 4:50 PM",5, 10,That's awesome! We are so happy you are enjoying the movement in Dance Collider. Please edit some custom songs and post them on our discord!!

I have played thru it and gone back to it time and time again. really fun tracks and so much fun dancing that you don[t wanna stop even when you're sweating rivers and out of breath. a nice change from beatsaber ( which is an excellent game btw ) but this really challenges you in differnt ways.

2022-05-28 13:09:57.306345,auhfel,This is the funnest game I have on VR,"I really liked Super Hot, but it got stale after awhile. Dance collider has so much more replay value, and dancing to the music and feeling the vibrations in the controller as you hit notes just feel so cool! 
I finally finished one song on extreme and it was so fun and exhilirating and just so worth it! Get this game!","Sep 30, 2020 at 3:16 PM",5, 3,We are so happy that you are having fun with Dance Collider! Extreme mode is very tricky so getting to the end is quite an achievement. Well done :)

2022-05-28 13:09:57.335268,cheeto79,,"I just got the Rift S and this was my first purchase. This game is exactly why I wanted to get VR in the first place - super fun, high energy, time flies and the fact that I'm getting a good cardio workout in is the icing on top. My main problem so far is I'm not in good enough shape to play  for as long as I'd like! Once it get's a little easier I'll probably add wrist weights to increase the challenge.

I am having a little bit of problem with lagging on some of the faster levels (I notice it most when going from a side-to-center section) and the trails sometime make it hard to see what's coming next. The arrows telling you when something is coming from the side are not as helpful as they should be... the placement feels a little off to really help. Other than that, great game, highly recommended!","Aug 15, 2020 at 8:29 PM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 13:10:00.456534,droberts1,Great Workout and Fun...,"Yeah, I only bought this at half price, but having played it I would pay normal price; actually I don't know why it is so cheap, it's fantastic game. It is no Beat Saber, which I play a lot, but it is not meant to be. This has your whole body moving, esp at higher levels, and like the guy below said, you get a workout and SWEAT! I really like this a lot, only played 4 hours worth so far, but I hope they keeping adding to this. Only suggestion I have is that they make the arrows that tell you where the next lot of orbs are coming from more obvious; I know they are big already but I just don't notice them because I am so busy dealing with the orbs!! Get this for a workout! Great fun!","Aug 13, 2020 at 7:56 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 13:10:00.471009,EIGHT-ZERO-EIGHT,JUST BUY THE F*****G GAME! SERIOUSLY!,"Hi! Just wanted to thank you guys for making this game so enjoyable.  I love that I can choose to play it like a boxing game or add in some flava to my movement. It not only FEELS good in-game but also LOOKS good from the outside perspective if you watch someone play it IRL., No disrespect to BeatSaber, but I know I look like an idiot from the outside view when playing that game^_^

Hitting beats feels so natural aside from the cascade trails, however I feel these trails play such an essential role in catching your breath before you get hit with the next flurry of colliders.

YOU WILL SWEAT! BY THE GODS YOU WILL SWEAT! Never thought cardio could be this much fun, seriously. 

JUST BUY THE F*****G GAME! ! - *Samuel Jackson Voice*","May 27, 2020 at 10:59 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 13:10:00.486959,Irony79,The next best thing to real clubbing,"I'd say avoid the game if you cannot stand electronic music. Otherwise, get it  NOW. 
From the moment the club with dark dancing figures appeared around me, I knew I was in good hands. It felt a bit like Tron. The tracks in-game are sweet. The characters, while cheesy, give the game a lot of - well, character.  And when the evil all-controlling A.I. challenged me to a dance off, it was hilarous (and its tracks are some intense ****)
I never played a dance game before, and thought all you do is reach out with your hands to touch the glowy thingies. It's not like that at all. There are lots of parts where you totally need to move your whole body. At the game's best moments, you can groove with the beat and get into a very intense flow. At its worst moments, it's still a fun, sweat-inducing test of your reflexes.
The more you are into electronica and clubbing, the more joy you will get out of this game.  I miss the club days!","Oct 24, 2020 at 3:18 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 13:10:00.500923,ShawnDigital,,"Lots of fun but could use some updating. I bought this forever ago but mainly use quest these days but rekindeled some old games with the quest link and still had fun in here. Its been replaced by quest games where untethered is helpful for movement and exercise, but I like the story / narrative and the visuals during gameplay are good but the characters do start to be annoying and repetitive and the limited tracks can be redudant. The ""hardcore""  AI update I found more an annoyance than fun and it feels a bit dated compared to whats out now so really could use some updates. Stilll a good game though","Jun 20, 2020 at 1:44 PM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 13:10:03.609259,TortoiseBoy,Really gets you moving.,I've logged hundreds of hours in BeatSaber and am still going for the top 150 UK but I absolutely love this game as something of a companion game that gets me moving in different ways. This really is like dancing and the way it gets you to accidentally learn coreography is incredibly impressive. Nice work guys!,"May 5, 2020 at 5:27 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 13:10:03.625217,NotaHumanResource,Best game in my library.,"I have about 25 titles in my Oculus library including beat saber , pistol whip and super hot but I love this game the best (and I don't even like dancing).  It feels like beat saber and a boxing game all in one.  Lots of characters to choose from. Great music and once you get the hand eye cordination and rythums down you can choose a more difficult level.  The boss will break you LOL.  My ONLY complaint with this game is that each character makes the same comments and I really wish there was more variation in their little quips and challenges.  These comments can get repetative after a while but you can just turn the character's sound down in settings.  I have to stop about every 4 rounds and clean all the sweat off my headset. Great workout!","Apr 1, 2020 at 10:49 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 13:10:03.640177,skullflash,Wicked fun,"This game is so much fun and looks way better than Beat Saber.
I really enjoy the different character dance styles and the music is wicked, proves you don't need named labels to have good music.

This is now my new favorite as I am fully hooked.

You need to port it to Quest.

A cross between boxvr and beat Saber. Visuals are great and you can get a proper workout even in normal mode. Music is also brilliant and not had one issue using link. Easily 5 stars.

2022-05-28 13:10:06.775430,IrishShaun,An Incredible Game!!,Well I never write reviews but since this game almost gave me a religious experience I probably should. I had never even heard of it until the day I purchased it. This puts BeatSaber to shame. To total shame. I have never felt immersion in a VR game like I have this one.  The music is to die for. I had never heard of f-777 before but I loved so many tunes so much it's hard to even describe. This is what I wanted in a VR experience. This game is worth so much more than its asking price.

2022-05-28 13:10:06.791388,Seeknoise,Challenging and really fun!,"A really fun and probably overlooked rhythm-action game! It's more challenging than Beat Saber, Audica and Pistol Whip, especially in the sense that you need to move around quite a bit more, but the easy difficulty will ease anyone into the play style efficiently enough. I kinda love the campaign storyline; it gives you a little bit more of a reason to play than just working your way through a track list and perfecting your scores on indvidual songs.

There aren't any licensed songs but the composer (or composers?) has done a really good job of creating great-sounding original tracks that span multiple EDM genres. I also really like the idea of each in-game character you compete against loosely representing a genre/style. Oh, and there's an option to add custom songs, which I haven't tried yet but will no doubt cater to anyone who'd like to use tracks from their own library.","Feb 23, 2020 at 5:42 AM",5, 7,

The Virtual invironment is uninspiring to me. The music is no Funk. It doesnt HIT IT like it should. But maybe I get old :). I really do like the custom feature. At least in this way you can correct the music and bypass the silly characters dancing like eighty year olds. Then this game is a great exersize tool. Exhausting! Only eight euros.

2022-05-28 13:10:09.903215,Bunnyfoofoo30,"Better than BoxVR, Beat Saber & Audica","I have many workout games in VR. NONE of them come close to the level of sweat and more importantly FUN that you'll enjoy with this game. I'm not a dancer and wish I was, this game makes me want to move and boy does it do that wonderfully. I sweat in 15 mins what would take me 30 mins in BOXVR with the level of movement in this game. 
TIP FOR RIFT S OR QUEST:  I made a custom plastic bag mask which ends just above my nose, cutting out eye and ear holes and used duct tape to reinforce the bag, no sweat whatsoever on the headset foam padding. Just don't wear it around your friends haha. But hey it works great and is reusable.","Feb 11, 2020 at 4:26 PM",5, 10,Hey Bunnyfoofoo that is awesome that you are sweating up a storm and enjoying DC!! This bag mask idea sounds interesting.

I liked the way the music floated in the air and connected with me.  With the great squating I wondered if I had messed up the view but then I realized it was a great design.

Update: Developer thanks for quick response!  Nice fix.  I unchecked some of the affects and gameplay is nice now.  Really enjoying the game.  Thanks!

Update 2: I've been playing this for awhile and still enjoying it. I like the some of the new updates. I would have liked the theme to be less dark though, something more cheerful, or at least an option to select some brighter themes.

2022-05-28 13:10:16.277963,goesBang,Awesome,"For me it's not really like Beat Saber, just the same game category: Rythm Games.

At the beginning it felt off because - following the tutorial - I wanted to jab the balls for more points - but when they come very fast in a row this feels very strange, not like dancing, more like working. Yes you can get more points - but it sometimes takes a bit of the fun away. For beginners: Don't jab too much...

The ball cascades in wide pattern - low and high, circling each other are really fun.
The music is just great (for me) - on the other hand - there aren't that many songs.

To improve:
The particle effects of the fast balls sometimes make it really hard to see the following balls.
Some stages have purple/black in the background - you cannot really see the purple/black balls that well before this background. Also these black triangles leading the ball cascades, sometimes very hard to see.

I finished all stages in normal mode at first try with A+ - it seems rather easy (after lots of Beat Saber), didn't even try easy mode after this. In pro mode I had to redo some rounds and there is lots of room for improvement. This is very exhausting! The progression isn't like expert to expert+ in Beat Saber, where some songs in Expert+ are just insane.

And you need space in your room, something like 2 by 2 meter is not enough!

4 stars because it has much less replay value than Beat Saber.","Oct 23, 2019 at 1:19 PM",4, 9,

Now I don't just hit the dots I actually try and dance (looking like a complete idiot to the real world). Still enjoy this game its so much fun. The game continues to get updates which get better and better. I'm the type of person who would never even consider dancing in a club so once I got over the who gives a **** what you look like phase I was wobbling about in vr ""dancing"" *cough* hitting blobs *cough* and standing still. Now I'm playing the pro setting and actually moving and dare I say it dancing. My wife says I look good now compared to when i started. I still think I look ridiculous  but odly epic?, especially if you find a song that you can get in to the rhythm of. 

Devs and more songs! Maybe get some popular main stream songs if ya can but keep the current trend of music comming.

Maybe earn the next song from completing the last last song to a particular level or something would be cool.

I'd even be happy to purchase ""special"" music to play in game to support continued development and support. (however still give us decent content for purchasing the game in the beginning.

It‘s such an amazing experience on my Rift: the visuals, the sounds, the overall feel of the game.
The only thing missing is ‚cutting the cable‘; I hope there will be a release for the Oculus Quest and maybe cross-buy. This has the ability to break the Beat Saber cycle if ‚let lose‘. I can only guess that without barriers, the game elevates to another level of experience!

devs: can you plz make the hit response of orbs a little more responsive? my only gripe is the [HIT] needs to have a little more oomfp. thnx! otherwise, kudos to you and your team! this game was/is an instant favorite!","Sep 21, 2019 at 4:16 PM",5, 3,Thanks for your review Jhunta! Really happy you are enjoying the game. We are updating Dance Collider all the time and have some big new features coming. We will look into the hits as well. Keep an eye out we have a new character going in very soon... it is pretty intense :)
2022-05-28 13:10:22.561924,Sztrovacsek81,Best fitness game,"I'm using this game as my daily fitness program (tried Beat Saber, Moonrider, Box VR, Power Beats VR). It's awesome, I think much better than the base Beat Saber and there are much more effort in this game from the developer side. I wish we could download community made tracks. Or at least some kind of automatic song creator would be fine (like under Box VR).
I hope it will come soon to Quest (like promised). Right now I'm playing it through (the newest) ALVR.","Nov 5, 2019 at 4:49 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 13:10:22.576884,paris.granville,Loads of Fun!,"This game is so well designed that you feel it in your heart. The long chains that you hit are exciting. The punch patterns are more complex than BoxVR. Also I like the Big Dance Bosses. They are hokey and cheesey in a way that adds lots of fun.  (Non native English and all) I can't believe that I didn't buy this earlier. 

WishList:
A Quest Version
A coop or side by side version with VRs
Add my own songs with AI designing the beats (like BoxVR)","Jul 17, 2019 at 12:20 PM",5, 3,"Really happy you love Dance Collider Paris. We are working towards releasing the full version of the game. More everything going in!! Thanks for your suggestions, we have been looking at these for a while, especially the AI song generation. That would be a cool feature to add in :)"
2022-05-28 13:10:22.592842,Detumaki,Wont load,"Hoping to get someones attention to fix a glitch. Oculus Rift, the game will not load. I open it, I can see it on my computer screen but my Oculus just shows it is loading.... and loading... and 20 minutes later still has not loaded anything beyond the music. It's been like this since I got it a couple hours ago. Interested in the videos I see but completely unable to do anything.","Jun 4, 2019 at 10:38 AM",1, 2,"Hi Detumaki, that is certainly not what we want to happen!! Can you please email me if all your other games are loading. Also your machine specs? Email tim@emergeworlds.com              We will figure out a way to sort this problem for you. Cheers, Tim"
2022-05-28 13:10:22.608307,PorkSwords,This is awesome,"What an absolute blast and a hidden gem. It's up there and even better in most ways than beat saber and other VR music games because of the flowing cascade  moves, selection of music, VR song editor and graphics.  I gave the song editor a few goes and tried with a some Chemical Brothers, Eminem, and some heavier tunes like Korn. It took me a while to get used to but I haven't seen anything near as good in any game.  It's all in Virtual Reality so you don't ever need to step out to the desktop. 

I would love to see a bit more character story as I felt the world needed some explanation. Multiplayer would work well for a game like this, and being able to challenge your friends face to face. Sharing capabilities. Song editor could do with a copy paste option. Some of the easy songs are pretty hard esspecially when you first begin. Definetely a Quest version would suit this as well.","May 26, 2019 at 10:12 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 13:10:22.624264,CYBL4DE,Cyber future club done right,"Pros:
- absolutely best sci-fi/cyber design I have seen in VR game
- I like those big holographic characters. Feels like (dance) battle agains bosses
- really cool soundtrack. 
- you can choose your style, but even styles like pop and hip hop sound like songs from the future

Cons:
- few performance issues - settings tweaking fixed the problem

Tips for new players:
- start on easy, no shame in that :-)
- do not jab incoming balls, try to swing your arms to the rhythm
- best way to score cascades for me was mowing my arm closer to body / head and just flowing
- get into the music and dance","Apr 21, 2019 at 7:52 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 13:10:25.709147,nosevole,,"Fun, however section of the dances go a tiny bit out of sync and spoil the rhythm making it feel more like a hit the target game than a dancer. The music is godawful, despite the musical categories it all sounds the same, and it's very arcadey. The little 'trash talk' bits remind me of SSX, which was quite nice :) Definitely good exercise, but not as accurate, satisfying or customisable as other dance/punch games.","May 8, 2019 at 12:58 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 13:10:25.726102,Casepb,It's decent.,"I was wanting some more music games similar to Beat Saber and Audica, so I decided to give this a try because I saw it was on sale.  This one isn't bad, but still needs work.  It's not nearly as satisfying to hit the orb notes as it is to chop the blocks in Beat Saber.  It needs to have more visual and audio feedback when punching them.  Hitting the big yellow orbs felt cooler though.  That's really my biggest complaint, the other visuals are fine, and the music isn't bad.  It all just needs to feel more satisfying.","Apr 22, 2019 at 4:47 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 13:10:25.741062,MAC_MAN86,Promising start,"Love the environments although these could also show some progression for each 3 rounds. Thought the ""snow"" should come towards us and found it weird to fall backwards in effect. Like the giant dancing avatar but these surely should be showing us how to move and follow rather than us waving arms about. Perhaps it does but is not obvious! I like the 8 styles of music only not sure yet how they all differ in moves.
What I do hate is the LOUD HIGH BEEP at the starts to begin and that must go!!!
I do like how it rewards for punches than just contacts and the repeated balls are way cool to manage 2 hands when they twist. Is the Big Star supposedly a 2hand block? It's not clear! You could add items that forces us to MOVE and yes we should be copying the dancing avatar else what's the point of a ""Dance"" title and it being there! I really like the music is VERY LOUD. Audio Settng for Voice does nothing but gets auto-adjusted for whatever reason. Needs a 2 Player Dance-Off (opponant becomes the Avatar and follows their moves) which can work as the rounds continue to the end rather than stop after a few misses. I like that you're adding player's song lists too soon!!! Open the Lobby to all Online Players to meet. Say up to 8 in a group and provide us similar avatars with proximity mic.
UPDATE today hasn't fixed the loud beep and nothing new. Want the dancers to follow the course. Also pressing Start then Begin is just daft!","Mar 30, 2019 at 4:35 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 13:10:25.757019,Tagget,Fun to play,Enjoy playing the game caught a few parts where the game would hang for a second but that might just be my computer will look into that later. One issue I have is some of the orbs where a little low for my height causing me to bend at the knee to hit and after a while my knees where hurting from the strain mostly in part of an old injury on the knee if there is a way to fix that it would be great. Other than that would recomend to any of my friends who have VR.,"Feb 10, 2019 at 2:39 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 13:10:25.772977,mjeezy23,Great game hoping for multiplayer,Great game. The learning curve is high. I am wondering if I have the stamina to make it past normal. I get my blood pumping after just 2 songs because I have to move my hands so much to keep up with the objects coming my way. I am hoping to soon compete against other players if multiple player mode gets added. The dances don't match up to the actual moves that the computer dancers use but each song has a unique edm dance genre and its close. I feel like the ai dancers make me want to dance longer since their competitive banter challenges me. This is a way better deal than beat saber since objects come at you from all directions and there are more songs as well. Each song has 3 stages.,"Jan 16, 2019 at 5:17 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 13:10:28.869863,jdukeOculus,Dance Design Feels Off,"I really want to show this game off to my friends and family by saying ""Hey, you have to try this, you'll feel like you're dancing with the orbs!"" Instead its going to go like this ""Hey this game is worth trying, but you're mostly whacking orbs with electronic background music""

It was really rare that I felt great synchronised combos. The reaching to the sides was obnoxious at best and punching sporadic orbs you could barely see hidden behind themselves keeps me frustrated. 

That being said, the cascades are REALLY cool, especially on the advanced mode (though I think even they could use improvement). I still prefer BoxVR for a music collision game but for music selection you guys killed BeatSaber and their raunchy disgusting 12 song playlist. 

3.5 Stars if I could give it. Not a bad game to add the genre. Great First Effort!","Jan 4, 2019 at 4:44 PM",3, 5,Thanks for your review jdukeOculus. We are working on improving the dances and timing in DC all the time. Happy that you loved the cascades! Also we will be adding in a song editor and free dance modes in the coming months so you can create your own dances in VR and dance to any song you like.
2022-05-28 13:10:28.885820,remark3d,Absolutely Fabulous ;),Same amazing as Beat Saber or BoxVR. Only one what I am missing is a better graphics setting. Resolution is realy on low level. I recomand OculusTrayTool. Anyway it is just Alfa/Beta version...,"Feb 7, 2019 at 7:09 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 13:10:28.900781,WonkyJon,Has promise,"As a regular Beat Saber player I thought I'd give this a go...
The Plus points
+Excellent graphics
+Excellent music
+'Rounds' is a great idea
+Global leaderboard
+The devs listen to their customers and interact!

Negative points
-Maps expect you to be able to use your prepheral vision. This combined with the small targets means some streams are more guesswork as to where your hands need to be. Not great when you need to be precise.

Overall, I can see why some might love this game but personally I couldnt recommend it at this stage. If you have the money to spare, buy it, you might love it. I can see the devs have put a lot of effort in so I dont see my money as wasted, I'll just let this game sit on the shelf and see how it matures - It could be wonderful!

02/11/18 This is an updated review, bumping from 3 stars to 4 as the devs responded to my review to let us know they have fixed two of my main gripes. The avatars can now be toggled off (yay!) and the high pitch noise when you fail is gone (Hurrah!!) thank you to the devs for taking on feedback and making changes.","Nov 2, 2018 at 10:43 PM",4, 35,

2022-05-28 13:10:32.061989,RE_86,Cool take on rhythm genre,"I didn't know what to expect when I bought this game. I wanted something a little different and the art looked cool so I purchased it. Let me say I am not dissapointed. It's got awesome music in different electronic styles, characters that taunt you as you play, and dances that get you very sweaty (on pro mode esspecially). It is a mixture of beat saber and audiosheild but it is different with the way it uses its patterns and the characters. I failed quite a few times on pro so it has me hooked already.","Sep 30, 2018 at 10:20 PM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 13:10:32.076949,Beezkneez74,Great rythym game,"Not just poking targets to music.  The targets are choreographed to make you move in line with the dance style.  Thoroughly enjoyable, and the expert levels may leave you needing a rest.","Nov 23, 2018 at 2:09 PM",5, 4,

I failed a few times which made me want to finish even more. This game has some different moves from other rhythm games because of the hand cascades and notes coming from different angles. The music is also top quality. Dance Collider has a lot of potential and I am looking forward to a beat editor to be added and more songs.","Nov 1, 2018 at 8:00 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 13:10:32.109861,BulldogBoy,Awesome arcade dance battles,Dance Collider is like an old school arcade game but in VR. It's the closest game in VR I have seen to DDR with the way it sends down dance patterns. It's got a 90's feel with the characters chiming in with dialogue. The use of its cascade nodes make you move your body and arms in very different ways to other rhythm games. Favorite characters are Remi and Dre. Their songs rock too.
