2022-05-28 16:55:56.673618,CinemaLeo,The Wonder of VR Cinema,"From engaging, potent documentaries to boundary-pushing experimental pieces, Within boasts an impressive (TOTALLY FREE!) array of VR cinema to please fans of the medium and newcomers alike.

My only qualm with the app is that the download times can be incredibly lengthy.  There is an option to stream directly within the app [although I have always found downloading to lead to a more stable, HQ experience].

But for a free app offering up literally hours of quality, varied VR cinema, that is a small price to pay.

Huge kudos for the team and filmmakers behind the platform!","Dec 24, 2020 at 9:25 PM",5, 12,

2022-05-28 16:55:56.702540,Gargom,Nice video VR content,"It's a very good hub for videos 360 (some of them in 3D). You can stream or Download to have the best performance.
A Question to developers: Where is  Hallelujah video? I can't find it. It is one of the most impresive videos. I always show it to everyone who try VR.","Jul 28, 2019 at 5:03 AM",4, 13,

2022-05-28 16:55:59.874058,Marchewiusz,Nice app with a variety of videos.,"As for a free app with free videos I have to say it is totally worth checking out. 
360 3D video eats up bandwith like Paula Dean eats spoons of butter, so make sure to download content beforehand. There is an option to do so.

On that note, it would be nice to be able to queue download and do something else, like play other games, because at first when you open the app, without any videos downloaded yet, you basicaly have to stand and do nothing since download works only when the app is running.","Oct 7, 2018 at 2:33 AM",5, 18,

2022-05-28 16:55:59.903977,Parallaxed,Good Media Platform,I found Within a good VR content app due to the ability to download the videos.  Streaming 3D content is spotty at best and downloading first is the best way to view the content without pauses or buffering.  While not all of the content is 3D most of what I've seen has been compelling.  Making the home menu screen positionally tracked is a big bonus.  I just wish that the content was positionally tracked as well :)  I found Within to be the go to app on mobile and the Oculus version is much more fluid as s to be expected.  Video resolution can be lower than desired but the content quality makes up for it.  Be sure to check out the Boston Dynamics feature.,"Jan 22, 2018 at 5:32 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 16:55:59.917940,rh_galaxy,Whats to complain about,"Of course the videos are not fully 3D, for that they have to be rendered in real time. Best we can hope for is stereo 360, and many are just that. I think it has some good contents and it's free, also the streaming works ok for me. Sure I would like better quality and framerate. Others suggested having 180 videos instead of 360, and thats probably a good idea.","Dec 22, 2017 at 9:41 AM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 16:56:03.063527,nightcat.mau,Terrible,"If you don't have hyper fast download speeds skip this one. After waiting what feels like hours you will be ""treated"" to a blurry video plastered with corporate logos or a blurry animation or other shovelware nobody cared enough about to convert to VR. I don't like sounding like a VR snob, but I'm sick of these attempts by greedy companies to use the Rift to spray us with terrible content nobody cared to quality check. My 3DO has better content than this.","Oct 7, 2017 at 8:21 AM",1, 14,

2022-05-28 16:56:03.093447,MarquisDeSang,This will make you hate VR (it's not VR),"No positional tracking, If you tilt your head you loose the 3D effect, The scale is always wrong (too small or too large), ugly image quality, extremely low frame rate video (below 90fps), Distorted image, No interractivity. On the PSVR there is the ""Joshua Bell Experience"" and this is how it's done. Videos are not VR and they will never be so stop it.","Sep 23, 2017 at 5:45 AM",1, 7,

2022-05-28 16:56:06.244020,Worpath,great attempt,Good controls.  But sadly IMHO 360 videos are just too compressed and low res looking.  Apps like this must get off the 360 hype and focus on 180 until better hardware is available.   180 real video content can be made barely acceptable...SLR for example.,"May 28, 2017 at 2:35 PM",3, 6,
