2022-05-28 19:56:48.974133,krisvdvijver,almost 4-star,"This could easily have been a 4-star game (I really love the Space mission!), but it would need a bit more polishing (the menus and tutorial are a mess, and they're ugly), some bug patches, a better interface (at first I didn't know how to leave the tutorial), an English translator to correct the spoken text (unless it was intentional?), and a clear direction for the game (the intro feels like a different game from the Space mission which feels very different from the intro).  Anyway, if the developers don't abandon it, nothing is lost!","Nov 3, 2020 at 10:18 AM",3, 2,

Developers, a suggestion to make this game better.
Use more weapons from the War Pack like the 50. Browning and the buzzsaw as well as the RPG. Additioanly allow the player to use saved currency to upgrade weapons stats. Use simple colison volumes where placing a weapon in a volume and paying increases a selected stat such as ammo capacity, damage or accruacy.
Just a thought, I'm gonna get back to kiling zombies so got to go.","Feb 4, 2020 at 7:14 AM",5, 19,
