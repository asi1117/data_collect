2022-05-28 12:22:30.936644,HomicydalHermit,Surprisingly boring.,"The hype around this game is one of the reasons I bought my Quest 2 (I use Quest link with a gaming PC). Unfortunately it’s a let down. The rock you’re facing during gameplay looks great. The scenery? Not so much. It’s doesn’t look realistic at all and the immersion is just not present in this game. 

And why is this rated “Intense”?! There’s no walking or smooth turning, there’s nothing falling towards you and there’s no fast-moving scenery. This rating just adds to the undeserved hype and fails to deliver. 

There is nothing jarring to the stomach and absolutely no fear of falling whatsoever. I would be terrified to climb rocks in real life. 


The jump mechanic is awful. I usually fall 3 times before I can get past any jump section. 

I can unrealistically climb hand over hand in some sections (seems like the only choice) where this would be impossible to do physically in real life. 

I don’t understand why this game got such high ratings. 

2 stars for rock graphics ( not scenery) and trying an original gaming idea.","Feb 18, 2021 at 9:58 PM",2, 117,

MULTIPLAYER WOULD BE AMAZING. Could you imagine you and a friend climbing together, tethered to each other and all of a sudden you have progress to be made with a brand new set of online mechanics.

2022-05-28 12:22:34.188064,Manydoors,Disapointed.,"I have had this on my wishlist for sometime and thought I would finally buy it while on offer.
Everyone talked about how bautiful the graphics are.  All I see are some blurry low rez textures poseing as a landscape.
The controls are awfull.  Example, if your going to jump or swing you don't press the B button, you swing or push of with your hands.  The stamina thing is a bit stupid, my granny could hand on longer.
I mean the whole experience is vastly underwhelming.  I suffer from vertigo in rl, but never once did I feel it in the climb, that shows how unconvincing it is.

I wouldn't bother unless it's very cheap and you want to fool about.","Nov 30, 2020 at 12:30 AM",2, 29,

2022-05-28 12:22:37.323815,eracerhead,,"I've owned this for two years, and every time I come back to it I'm playing for days.  Yes, there are only four environments in it (looking forward to more in Climb 2) but each has numerous different paths to take.  And even if you know the way up each one, there is always a continuing challenge to take new holds or skipping past others, esp. as its necessary to unlock the 5-minute progress awards.  

I especially enjoy climbing in the Bay environment, as I vacationed in a very similar spot in Thailand three years ago.  The scenery is spot-on, and the launch of the paper lanterns was very much part of that trip.  It's like going on vacation all over again.

The North trail (""Icebreaker"", I think) is fantastic in its sense of scale and terror.  Climbing along the side of a rusty ship hull, lodged precariously above a stream of lava, there's a sense of immediacy to every grip you take.  Especially as some of those aren't easy to see, and you have to commit to a jump that could easily spell doom.  Reaching the top of this stage leads to a striking cinematic event, and I found myself sitting down on the platform for five minutes watching it unfold.

All in all, this sort of game is unique in that it doesn't focus on fast pace or  immediate reward.  Well, small rewards in that the each grip is an accomplishment.  But the pacing of each climb makes for a very different experience than most other games I've played.  Bring on Climb 2!","Sep 16, 2020 at 10:12 PM",5, 58,

I am one of the 4 in 10 that experience motion sickness so was expecting the worst with this game, however I am yet to experience any motion sickness. This game also supports cross-platform-buy which was a life saver for me as the game does not seem to function correctly on the Quest either via Link or via virtual desktop. Getting into a climbing rhythm in these great backdrop environments is simple fun and somewhat carthic. This is a game where you rinse and repeat, looking to increase your score, unlock content and find hidden objects. Glad I took the plunge and tried it out.","Aug 9, 2020 at 7:13 AM",5, 12,

2022-05-28 12:22:43.635683,RaveJesus,Laughing at the low-reviews,"The lack of intelligence never ceases to amaze me with some of these people. The most recent review behind mine is complaining about having to ""Rush"" through when literally no level requires that. Guess he forgot the part of the tutorial where it teaches you to use both hands, OR half-press the trigger to not use any stamina. 
Another person complained that the game is ""Too easy"" because he played the FIRST TUTORIAL LEVEL. 
Finally, another guy is giving it a 1-star because he's not smart enough to turn off his Anti-Virus. I love it.

ACTUAL REVIEW FROM SOMEONE WHO ISN'T INEPT:
Game has some nice visuals and really provides a good sense of scale when you're climbing around or just looking at the scenary. The later levels get a bit challenging with the half-grip and rechalking your hands. Plus, some of the jumps are taunting as heck. Atmosphere and Audio are also pretty good too, and the ambient sound is nice to listen to. The levels progressively get more and more complex, with different routes and some shortcuts if you are up to it. The whole point of the game is to complete the climb as fast as possible, but there's a gamemode that completely removes the timer and stamina if you just want to enjoy the view.

Only negative I have? I want more locations. I need more. As someone who used to free-climb in Arizona, rock-climbing/mountain-climbing is such a fun and thrilling experience. I really wish they'd continue to add more stages, but alas, you get what you get.","Jun 9, 2020 at 12:02 AM",4, 325,

I finally was able to purchase this game and it was not entirely what I had expected. I am presonally VERY scared of heights, yet this game didn't seem to scare me.. at all. I'm not sure if for some reason It's just that I don't feel that VR feels real, or it's the game. I'll give the game the benefit of the doubt and say that It's just a me problem. Other than that the game is simple and very good for exersize. 
Also, I just do not think that this game is worth the price. For $15-20, it would be decent, but for this specific game, $30 is a bit much for the average consumer.","Jun 10, 2020 at 7:04 AM",4, 30,

I've already tried this kind of game in VR Rooms and I really enjoyed it.
But honestly it lacks a certain something in my opinion, we should be getting a feedback in the controller when holding onto something. A vibration even a tiny one would give a better immersion.

2022-05-28 12:22:49.894682,ItzHazzer,Amazing!,"This games graphics and detail is top notch amazing. I love this game even though ive only played it for 10 mins. I really do think this game has true potential. The amount of realism is as best as it can get. I do know however that if you are expecting to feel like you are climbing like real life you will get a slight feel of that but not the full thriller. When playing VR you are sitting or standing. This game is taking the realism of climbing mountains etc. You cant float whilst playing VR although i got really scared when a beam i was holding on to started to break. Really gave me the shivers... All in all amazing game great purchase. I would not pay the asking £22.99 at the moment but hopefully with more updates coming that would be the price i would pay. I would however pay £14.99 for this game at the moment. Do not take what i say as a bad thing because of how its worded.

The game is a little bit hard and sometimes frustrating to find where to go, but eventually you will find a way. Overall, I think that this game is worth the price.","Jun 22, 2020 at 3:15 AM",4, 24,

This app is that and more. I've never gone climbing before and probably don't have the upper body strength for it but this app simulates all the aspects of climbing that I think I would enjoy except for the wind and fresh air.

It defaults to graphics so low I could only tell what I was looking at because I saw the same assets on Quest first. If you want it to look better, enjoy spending a half hour tweaking settings to figure out how to make it look even close to acceptable compared to a MOBILE HEADSET.

I could probably get the PC version to an acceptable point, but it’s clear they gave up on modernizing this game and I don’t care enough to brute force an acceptable experience.

Also this is a minor thing but it bugs me, the PC hands are COMICALLY HUGE! Seriously, they look realistic but are at least twice the size of human hands and it’s very unsettling.","Jan 10, 2020 at 11:46 PM",3, 7,

But I have one main problem that's nearly enough for me to delete it. After a fall, it never, or nearly never, sets me back to the last savepoint, even if that save point or accompliment was a big one. After a fall I get set back many savepoints, and I have to go through those climbs again. I can't figure out why this is happening, but it is ruining the game. I see others asking the same question.  I think I'm past the refund time limit. I'm not sure what I'm going to do. It was an expensive game. I'm willing to ignore a lot. But the savepopints must work. They just plain must work. The game has been out for how many years now? And the save points still don't work properly? Seriously? I also have trouble with the sound stopping abruptly after a few minutes.

The way some people were describing it in their reviews made it sound like it wasn't worth $40.00.   It went on sale for $20.00 and I grabbed it.  It was totally worth it.   Its really fun and has beautiful scenery.   I'm only 1 level away from finishing the game on hard and I have to say out of all the VR games I have, this is definately 1 of my top ones.  I'm really surprised by that too since this was one of the first VR games released.   I could see myself replaying this in a year or so.

Update: Fast foward a couple years later and I got a new computer (12th gen Intel CPU) but this game was crashing on load.  I found the solution on Reddit.  It has something to do with OpenSSL and newer generation CPUs.
Follow these steps:

Go to System --> Advanced System Settings --> Environment Variables (You might get to this differently in different versions of Windows)

In THE SECOND window (""System Variables"") click NEW

Enter name ""OPENSSL_ia32cap""

Enter value ""0x200000200000000""

Then click OK

You must REBOOT SYSTEM

I've had my rift for over a year and have played a lot of different games on it but this is easily one of the most impressive. Honestly, I hesitated for so long buying this game because I doubted they could pull off the feeling of climbing a cliff in VR and also thought, how challenging and fun can it be? It turns out that it is QUITE challenging and fun! First of all, they nailed the mechanics. You really feel like you are hanging precariously from a cliff and forget you are standing in a room of your house. The fatigue system works quite well and the number of different handhold types and precarious situations you get into make it quite thrilling. Nothing like having to jump to an out of reach handhold across a chasm and just managing to grab it with one hand. Also, the graphics really make you feel like you are in an exotic locale. The game also has high replayability improving your score and unlocking achievements in the various locations and difficulty levels.

Lacks in gameplay and as such, replayability since there are only 12 main levels with several shorter ones, though I am not saying the game isn't difficult, some levels took me almost half an hour to beat. Most of the gameplay as expected comes from just getting a better time and score, so if you aren't the type who like climbing scoreboards, best give this game a miss. And though I have seen few VR games with such detailed environments, it is hardly worth $40 if you aren't going to be fully impressed by it (for those with a few dozen hours in VR, for instance).

2022-05-28 12:23:30.904178,faitch,Favorite so far,"This is by far, one of my favorite titles so far.
Being pretty new to VR, i was a bit reluctant on getting it because some of the games with Comfort level higher than moderate makes my head spin but i couldn't resist getting it anyway and that was an amazing choice i did.
The comfort level INTENSE is mainly due to the fear of height which is very well represented in this game but, for me , since my feet are grounded on the floor, i can easily counter this fear. 
The feeling and the view are incredibly crafted and if you play with touch controller, you can really feel what the game is about. 
Speaking of touch controls, you can easily simulate the real experience and feel the strain in your arm if you simulate your body weight by always having your arm in the air as if you were holding on to something and only resting at checkpoints or a 2 hand grip.
Works very well on the Rift S and i recommend everyone to give it a try.","Jun 10, 2019 at 2:10 AM",5, 23,

This idea has great realization using interesting mechanics. I dont know if possible to make VR climbing more intuitive and challeging at once. The game leads player from easy start to real master of climbing growing difficulty smoothly and represents absolutely polished product.
Beautifull nature around you is stunning sometimes, tricks you got to make will make you sweat =).
I recommend to take the game in bundle as fare deal. And dont forget to play only with touch pads - using gamepad you will loose 80% of fun.

2022-05-28 12:23:49.858194,Tomatenmann,Very immersive with a few flaws,"I kinda have a fear of heights and the game takes full advantage of it. Hanging on a cable over a deep valley valley looking out for the next grip and realizing there is none within reach... unless I make a huge jump to that cable car. I actually didn't want to believe that I had to make that jump. This and other moments were pure adrenaline. 

The Climb is a looker. Beautiful environments, detailed rock surfaces and quite some events happening around you. Graphically it's also a very demanding game and it really shines if you crank up the supersampling.

There are only a handful of different environments, but each contains a couple of stages and challenges which feel varied enough.

The climbing mechanics feel good, especially if you know that the game could only be played with a normal controller when it was released. The later added touch controls improved the experience a lot. Like it's almost a different game now.

But it has its flaws. The black screen when your head collides with objects, especially important things like ladders or beams can get very annoying. The approach Lone Echo has taken with pushing you away from the object is way more convenient.

Also the risky jumps you have to make are pretty tough to estimate. A lot of times I bumped against the rocks above me and fell. You also can't control intensity of the jump.

Other than these issues and that the nature of the game is kind of repetitive, I can only recommend the Climb. The developers tried a lot to keep each stage fresh with new and surprising routes and challenges. Also making it to checkpoints often rewards you with some nice events like skydivers rushing above your head or an erruption of a mountain in the distance. Or you just enjoy the beautiful vista.

Can't wait to try out the Oculus Quest port which is also a cross-buy title and free if you already own the Rift version.","May 10, 2019 at 11:09 AM",4, 3,

Must say the first time i played it i was using muscles that i probably rarely get to flex so i did actually give myself bad back ache and a sore shoulder the next day so new players be careful it can be quite a work out. 5/5 this game is worth the money for the experience in my book.","Apr 1, 2019 at 6:22 AM",5, 7,

Fantastic graphics, great VR implementation now with the Touch controls, lots of content, challenge, secrets to find, stuff to unlock.  But one completely unavoidable mechanic really spoils the game for me - virtual jumping.  First, while they have a way to do more realistic jumping where you push yourself off something, in many places this isn't functional and you have to use the ""A button"" jumping mechanic.  I could overlook the lack of immersion (and complete lack of realism that having 95% of these jumps brings) that causes, but it is just so incredibly unreliable.  From hitting your virtual head on objects and immediately falling, etc.  The mechanic could have been made playable if when holding the A button you saw a ""ghost"" image of where your body would go/the arc of the jump, but unfortunately at this point I'm sure nothing more will be added to the game.","Aug 7, 2019 at 10:37 PM",2, 6,

I bought The Climb based on reviews, and I'm glad I did. I LOVE this game. I LOVE the controls of the Rift and the tracking. I haven't touched the PSVR since. I'm afraid of heights, and after finishing the first level (after falling MANY times)... I took the headset off and I was shaking and my legs were a little weak. My fear of heights elevated the intensity of this game to the extreme. I highly recommend this game.

The gameplay is quite arcadey in progress with some aesthetic unlocks to add a little personal touch, and the menu style is very reminiscent of games like Dirt 3. At least the menus look just as good as the environment. The gameplay is fun with some challenging holds to learn to navigate but nothing too complicated.

My few quirks are small, but noticable. The menu can sometimes be a little convoluted needing lots of button presses to go forwards and backwards and it's not always intuitive. You use trigger to grip, which although feels weird to me because I'm a rock climber and it feels more natural to grip with the whole hand grip, I find this weird in all VR games when there's a grip button - trigger grip is a very much the Vive style. Lastly the peformance can be ropey sometimes, some active elements like rocking ladders and little scenes like bears or birds can make the game drop frames, but most of the time it's okay. The spectator view is for some reason portrait, like a phone screen, and is absolutely abysmal for recording or showing friends.","Nov 12, 2018 at 7:07 AM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 12:24:46.860760,Howardhorst,Exciting game with an exasperating flaw!,"""The Climb"" is easily one of the best VR experiences I've had and it alone is worth the price of the Oculus. The concept and gameplay are simple; but it's far from boring, especially if you have a fear of heights.  Not that the devs needed to make it more involved; but they added fun pick ups on some of the mountains to keep it interesting. When you fall, you feel it. When you get to the top of the mountain, there's a genuine sense of accomplishment.  This would be a five star game if it weren't for one terrible flaw. That is, when your virtual character ""clips"" with an object in the game (a part of the mountain behind you, for instance), the screen goes black and you'll get a message stating that you've intersected something and you need to move.  Ummmm....ok; but I'm hanging on the side of a mountain and because the screen is black, I can't find the next handhold.  What's bad is that, by design, you have to climb under things that will naturally clip you (an overturned ladder, for instance). This is EXCEPTIONALLY bad when trying to jump from one handhold to the next (which you do a lot) because in mid-jump, the screen will go black (because you'll clip an object above you) and it's impossible to aim for the next handhold.  Grabbing onto it is a matter of blind luck.  I don't mind failing if it's a misjudgement on my part; but if it's because of an obvious flaw on the devs part, it's maddening.  Either allow the player to clip objects or show the message at the bottom of the screen and give the player the ability to find their way out of the situation. Despite that rant, it doesn't take away the fact that this game is frikkin awesome!","Mar 22, 2018 at 12:16 AM",4, 9,

However I got this as part of a christmas game pack and in a moment of boredom decided to install it and have a go.
The game it's self is simple mechanic's, you reach up to one hold after another, sometimes jumping to make the next hold. Eventually you reach one of the stages, then the top. Each climb unlocking another climb in one the four places you can visit.
After a while, looking up with you arms held over your head can make your shoulder and arms ache but otherswise simple stuff.

What got me though and made me play for hours at a time was the general sense of peace and tranquility. All you hear all the way through your climb is nature around you and your alter ego's breathing. It creates a feeling of oneness with the environment and is genuinely relaxing.","Feb 2, 2018 at 6:12 AM",5, 36,

2022-05-28 12:24:50.104178,carlo.wikinson,"The ""interupted"" Climb","I gave this game 3 stars, some may feel this is a tad negative. not so based upon first hand experience I was a myself a rock climber years ago, yes also a poor head for heights and thus i yearned for a realistic experence in VR as promised by many reviews and of course the high ratings on here, so im not being biased. 

So let see its positive points. The Climb does has amazing scenery for Vr for myself it brought fond memories of staring at rock , the back of finely manicured hands and occasionally when i felt brave the churning depth. The Climb has fairly good sound with the music off of course, for myself its great upper body excersize and yes for 15 mins or so was fully immersive and enjoyable. 

Now for the bad, of course there is the occasional clipping which is forgivable and common in Vr, however by far the worst thing and i was using the touch controllers, is that everytime you make a leap across, move upwards or round corners there is a highly perceptrble shifting of the scenery away from you, a quite ugly fault in fact, almost like i have a really bad tendency to lauch myself backwards off the cliff face as i had suddenly spotted an alligator at 500ft or so, a definate poor perspective 
 for an ex climber.  As for the timing of jumping itself very poorly simulated with the leap of backwards often here too and then theres the real ""intended"" immersion breakers, items you climb suddeny breaks that many have ""apparently"" climbed before which is actually quite rare in climbing except in movies, I suppose its apparently all designed for that addictive false spurt of adrenaline or to cover up an inconsolable bug ,what utter gaming nonsense as the climb itself would have been way good enough without breaking items and of course makes it highly improbable of ever really enjoying a full climb. in fact all deal breaker for me, as I didnt die once on a real climb and very rarely slipped although i did see a Crocodile onna clifface in the lake district once.","Mar 25, 2018 at 4:52 AM",3, 2,

I find myself continually coming back to this game. The controls are intuitive, and the immersiveness is second to none. But what I like the most is the replayability. Not only are there multiple paths through every single climb, there is a myriad of challenges and achievements to keep you busy. Four different ""Biomes"" with 3 climbs and two boulders (short, challenging climbs with no save points and no chalking!) each. And when you're done with all of those, you can race not just against the clock, but the entire community.  If I could only have one game on my Oculus, this would be the one!! I'm so hoping that the devs release more climbs!! Perhaps some lush rainforest climbs? Maybe some pacific northwest bouldering? Incredible experience. 5/5 stars.","Jan 25, 2018 at 7:10 PM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 12:25:15.438279,CharveL68,,"As a rock climber that climbs 5.12 lead and boulders around a V7 grade I avoided this title like the plague since getting the Rift.  Climbing is all about the physical aspect guided by climbing technique.  There is no way that a VR experience can reproduce even the slightest nuance of what it takes to climb.

That said, I saw it go on sale and thought 'what the he11'.  So I fired it up to see what it's all about and although I just did one level I was a bit taken aback how it might actually turn out to be a fun experience despite initial misgivings.

The first thing I noticed is how big, clumsy and creepy the hands look and feel but I got over that.  The other big thing that's missing for any type of climbing simulation is feet.  It's probably not possible to implement feet - or say 98% of any real climbing motions at all actually - due to the lack of physical feedback, but I wasn't really going in expecting that anyway.  What we're left with is a 'campusing' (hanging from your hands/fingers no feet) simulator puzzle.

Despite those major limitations it does manage to give some idea of how to think your way through a route/problem, and manage your strength to some degree.  Having to sometimes awkwardly reach for holds is as nicely done as they are able to and can be a great introduction to the sport to people who wouldn't otherwise realize how much more better and fun it is as a way to get in shape than crossfit or weight lifting.  Watch any of these ninja warrior like competitions and see what training style dominates. ;)

Dynos (jumping) are awkward but give you a taste of the thrill of them, and it's pretty cool to stand on the final platform and enjoy your virtual accomplishment.  The graphics aren't bad either.

I think I will enjoy the rest of the game and environments for what they are and hope that it will introduce this amazing and surprisingly safe, sport to more people.","Jan 5, 2018 at 4:46 AM",4, 6,

I found it to be a bit glitchy though.  I regularly get knocked off rocks depsite having moved in the proper way with enough stamina, chalk, etc.  It randomly lets go.  Also the the movements like cleaning off a ledge, don't always work.  Since you are on time hanging there, you don't have time to deal with the glitch of wiping off the dirt and it not working.  Also, climbing on platforms can be a bit glitchy.  You may have to try a couple of times and keep catching yourself, even though you are up on the platform in the view.","Jan 8, 2018 at 3:16 AM",3, 1,

So I got some wrist weights (0.5 kg each) and it became quite an interesting workout, plus, I get some sweat for getting to the top.

The view from the top of the climb is very rewarding and you almost feel like you have really earned it.  You can crank up the supersampling to sharpen up the graphics a hell of a lot as the resulting lower framerate is not really an issue because you are not moving around fast.  There is only one issue I have with the game; while playing it I thought what a fantastic experience it would be for people not physically able to do this in real life such as wheelchair-bound etc.  But there’s the rub; there are several times where I had to physically jump to get hold of the first hand hold from a staging platform.  The A button on the touch controller that can be used to jump during mid-climb does not make you to jump from a stage platform.  Unless I am missing something this makes it impossible for those not physically able; am I wrong, or does this need fixed?","Jan 6, 2018 at 12:54 AM",5, 4,

Just don't take it seriously.  It's nothing like climbing - although, your arms will ache.  It's just fun - more so with family/friends and does have a competitive leaning with timing/scores, which aids the fun more so.  The graphics, although neat, are too cartoony/bright to convey a feeling of actually being there, or being at height - which is a shame.  All this game has going for it is competitive fun and at £40 - just not worth it.  The sale price £8, for sure, worth it.","Dec 27, 2017 at 7:57 PM",3, 7,

But ultimately, the environments are beautiful, the feeling you get from climbing is amazing, the sense of accomplishment topped off by some sort of show (be it fireworks or crumbling ice-caps or whatever) is stellar and even if you don't enjoy it enough to play it often I still think it's definitely an experience worth experiencing!","Jan 6, 2018 at 11:16 PM",5, 0,

Oh well, guess what... this is LIT. It's fun, it's beautiful, it's original. You even have that good old progression system where you unlock new cosmetics (gloves, watch etc). Wasn't expecting that at all in this game. But what stroke me the most is the attention to the details. You are not progressing in a dead environment made of just a few rocks and heights. There is actually a life going on there : animals, helicopters... for me, the immersion was real. And finally, when you achieve your climb, you can see that beautiful landscape you deserve.

Anyway you dont feel like actually climbing. Second, your hands can only hold on certain points on a single ledge, the game just teleport(sorta, it's moving fast) you into a confortable position accordingly--which causes a lot headaches. Third, when you fall, you dont stop or got hold onto the nearest safepoint, you just fall straightly--with FREAKIN SCREAMING. Seriously it's a little disturbing. The last is visual, they modified with cartoony style, it hurt immersion, and personally: it is my headache's second main source.  I still believe the experience can be enhances if they made a Climb 2 just for touch controller. For this early OculusRift game, just wait for a discount (And it's like 80 percent off on 2017 WinterSale).

You climb mountains in xyz location and they throw in some difficulty moves as you progress. There's no story or anything...just climbing. 

The game is beautiful, but I think it should sit pricing-wise in line with most other good VR games: $40.","Oct 1, 2017 at 3:32 AM",3, 4,

2022-05-28 12:25:50.383475,john_rossitter,A Well done game for the most part,"I really looked forward to playing this, so I bought it and installed it while I was at work. Once I got home to play it, I spent a long time inside the environment and really enjoyed it. Overall the experience is really great, the sense of immersion is very intense and at time can actually be a bit too much. I did 4 climbs on the first level and feel that I understand the mechanics of the game well enough. Visually, they did a great job on it, the Physically Based Shading is really nice to see in a VR game.

Here is what I didn't like:
1) There are quite a lot of times when there is HDM collisions with rocks, and it causes the screen to just go black.
2) It's too easy to accidentally hit the Oculus home button when trying to use the Jump command
3) There was a good bit of stutter, which is quite a shock to me running on a 1080.
4) The pace of the game is not designed to really let you stop and admire the scene, if you stop, you die...I think it would be nice to have the ability to just explore the world and look at the level they created.

I have never in my life experienced VR Sickenss, but this game caused me to feel quite ill after about an hour of solid play. There is quite a lot of head and arm movement in this one, so if you are not keeping track, it is easy to stay in the game too long and make yourself dizzy.

I will continue to play it for sure though.","Aug 29, 2017 at 9:48 PM",4, 8,

Unlike games like Chronos or Edge of Nowhere which I played through to completion and then stopped this is a game to dip into when the mood takes you. There are four zones each with 5
 climbs and you need to complete the easy ones first to unlock the next. I find tremendous replayability in each climb, I've probably done the first climb in the Bay zone twenty times or so. Actually as somebody who is scared of heights I don't really enjoy a climb until I've done it a couple times and feel comfortable then it becomes a nice Zen experience. I love the mechanics of the climb with the touch controllers, the graphics are awesome and they have packed it with extras such as unlockable watches, gloves, cameras to discover, a global leaderboard and achievements. You may not play this game for hours at a time but it's one that's always fun to pick up and climb for 20 minutes a couple days a week and I reckon I'll still be doing that a year from now.

The main problem for me is how the game handles the view. The black out caouse by the head hitting objects is very frequent and annoying as hell. You basically die everytime because you jump and your head enters the mountain and the game promptly blacks out to tell you you are clipping inside the wall with your headset, the game doesn't pause, you fall, it breaks immersion and flow. Really you need to get rid of this feature because it's game and immersion breaking.

There is the odd bit of glitches with the controls but very seldom and not a significant problem. The climbs can end up being fairly long and you actually get just a little fatigued from scrambling and flailing through them.

2022-05-28 12:26:03.024634,Sitruz,Beautiful and engaging,"I bought The Climb in the latest summer sale special multi-game pack, and I've been playing it every evening before bed. It's so relaxing and the scenery is stunning. It's suprising it can get you sweating a bit having your hands in the air reaching for ledge after ledge. It must look like I'm performing some kind of tribal war dance to spectators!

On my GTX1080 it seems to running nicely. I have the framerate drop warning on, and only every so often do I get a glitch moment and drop a bit low. I'm on medium settings.

I like the unlockables as you go on, and that there are multiple paths to each finish point. The progress section makes you keep going to get that next award and possibly unlock something new. I don't know if the unlockables are cosmetic only, I'd like to think if I've achieved something, I'll get something thats going up my game (extra reach, better/longer grip time).

My only grumble would be whilst the locals are beautiful, most of the scenery is extremely blurry. I know blurry, pixelated graphics are the norm for VR, but even close up stuff could look a touch clearer even with SS on 1.5.

Graphics are really good, I bought a 1080ti just to play this on highest detail.

A few times I've thought nah its just climbing and doesnt have anything else to it, which is true. I've found however that everytime I want to kill a bit of time I load this up just so I can climb the alps before I go to bed. Every level is worth climbing because of the final view you get, it doesnt actually get boring seeing whatever is at the top, and theres always something happening :-) Ive literally stood there for about 5 minutes just looking round, and you genuinely feel a small sense of acheivement when you make it to the top.

The levels do actually get progressively more difficult to climb and you find you'll end up falling a good few times. What I will say is after you've fell about 30x it doesnt phase you anymore. First few times really get you though  ;-)

My only ask would be that it was multiplayer, it would carry this game so much further, climbing and talking to your friends. They really missed a trick there.","Jul 19, 2017 at 3:43 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 12:26:22.089812,Dheacon,Intense... Intensely FUN!,"Wow.  This game fully delivers on the promise.  Yes, the intense rating is very much correct.  I often find myself having to pause on landings to wipe sweat off my real hands.

The scenery and mountain-scapes are excellently rendered, and the small touches with moving/live ambient environments make the climbs feel truly immersive.  

2 very minor issues for me are:
1) the chalking motion seems a tad gimmicky (I would much prefer to dip the hand in a chalk bag rather than wave it wildly ""in time"")
2) The side-jump is just a tad awkward .  I would like th be able to keep a hand extended for the catch while jumping.  To be sure, this may be a function of my coordination as the user for the ledge grab, but it seems still somewhat inelegant given the remainder of the control mechanics.

All in all, the quite minor issues do not deter me from giving a fully enthusiast 5-star rating.","Jul 6, 2017 at 8:43 AM",5, 4,

The gameplay itself is engaging and really gets your heart pumping. I have to commend the small details like the bugs flying around or finding hidden eggs in nook and crannies. 

There's a sense of accomplishment in the game when you reach the top that not many games are able to do.

Unlike other reviewers, I think the levels are the perfect length. Any shorter would be lackluster, and any longer would be painful. I only felt motion sickness once, but I've never been prone to it. Though I do agree with others, one climb is enough per play session because this game is taxing. I stop after one level and have broken a sweat and need to sit down. There are 4 mountains, each with 3 climbs and 2 tumbler maps (which I have yet to unlock) and an endless mode for practicing. Plus, there's hidden items to collect and new gear to unlock.

Almost a must buy for early VR adopters.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visually its stunning. Its smooth, a very comfortable VR experience. There are a few technical hitches like getting stuck in objects and jumping 180 is jarring because it snaps your viewpoint. They happen very little, and I cant think of a better way to get around it, so I cant complaint oo much. Its Crytek, and they delivered a Crytek bar of visuals.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay, its fun, its easy. I found in the more challenging climbs I was more struggling with controls than struggling with the difficulty, which I wasnt doing early on. That was a bit frustrating, but again, its hard for me to come up with ways to make a basic concept more 'challenging', so its hard to fault the designers. Game wise, its okay, its nothing to call home about. But its a rock climbing game, you sort of know what youre buying. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At that price, it seems equivelant to the market, and good value. Its not too deep, just a bit more than a tech demo. But very polished and very enjoyable.

After a couple minutes I just want to take a quick break but it keeps going and going.  I am a rock climber and this is probably the closest you will get from your living room to real rock climbing.  I'd say give it a shot if you have ever wondered what climbing is like w/o actually doing it.  Who knows it might make you want to go to  a climbing gym in real life.  I'll give it two more stars if some how they magiclly fix the dizzyness issue.  I'm not the only one.  Shorter levels?  Add a timed pause feature for people like me.  You could pause for a few min and show videos that give tips and tricks for real climbing.  I don't know - I really WANT to love this game but I don't.

2022-05-28 12:27:09.810572,Veraxus,A must-have for Touch owners,"This is absolutely my favorite Touch game, and I own them all. The early levels are a little MEH, to be sure, but once you unlock the medium and hard difficulties, the game turns into a first-person, VR Tomb Raider... challenging you to take chances, pay close attention to the scenery, and get creative.

My one complaint is the the lack of DLC. You heard that right, I'd happily pay for new mountains if they were available... especially if they were composed entirely of higher-difficulty climbs, where holds might not be obvious and levels are littered with adventurous set-pieces.

If you have Touch, do yourself a favor and buy this. Stick it out through the easy difficulties, because they're just preparing you for what comes later. Also, this game is very comfortable in VR with Touch, but can definitely cause some motion sickness if you're only using a gamepad. But again, this is a game that really has to be played with Touch to get the most out of it.","Jan 20, 2017 at 9:27 AM",5, 11,

Movement wise it felt like a comfortable rated game to me or at most, slightly moderate. I am happy for this since I was expecting to get sick and not be able to play it.

I enjoy the game and I am probably one of the few or maybe the only one who sort of prefers it with the gamepad. I much prefer being able to reach for holds with the touch controllers but it feels more like you are pulling the mountain down towards you than pulling yourself up....just feels very weird to me and kills a lot of the immersion since there is no sense of body weight as you move. This is especially the case when you're just in one spot and move your hands and the mountain moves. Maybe if they had the mountain move at a slower speed or just got rid of that when you're stationary it wouldn't be so weird to me. I felt more ""there"" while playing it with the gamepad than I do with the touch controllers.

Another thing I dislike is the blacked out message whenever your head intersects with the mountain/objects. Instead of making the screen black and giving people that message, maybe they should have made it so your head can't go through things. 

All in all a fun game although I don't feel it is worth the full price they charge so I'd say wait for a sale or get it in a bundle which is what I did.","Jan 6, 2017 at 12:09 PM",4, 1,

Although not everyone will be able to handle The Climb's unique form of locomotion (using your hands to move the world), it is a title that manages to capture much of the emotion of actual climbing - the sense of danger, of struggle, of achievement. I really appreciate their attentiveness to options for gender and skin tone, and the new Touch support feels great. This is a game where Touch really works better than Vive because it feels more like you're using your actual hands to climb. Although it does not begin to emulate the actual strength and athleticism required of actual climbers, there is a lot more effort in standing and raising and moving your arms than sitting in a chair with a gamepad. My only issues were minor: there's no tutorialization of mechanics (it only shows you which way to go), and I was slightly annoyed at my character's celebration audio at the top because I preferred to celebrate myself.","Dec 18, 2016 at 6:52 AM",5, 2,

Also, for beginners, make sure to grip things with two hands if you don't want to fall. I don't know why but it just didn't click in my brain that if I use two hands I would not fall, I thought there was fatigue when using two. I must not have followed the tutorial properly.

But The Climb is surprisingly playable with just the XBox controller and gaze-aim (which I think was greatly improved a couple of weeks ago). Once you get the hang of it, start doing jumps to get upwards (and downwards) faster you really forget that it is a standard controller in the hands. And once up on a checkpoint or the top I find myself stretching my fingers because I've been gripping it so intently. I actually fear that the Touch might not be the best control for this game since with touch I would probably venture too far down the uncanny valley since my hands won't be holding the weight.

My Thoughts:
Ok first things first.... Crytek is one of my favourite game developers so I was very excited to be able to play this game.
WOW! This game just totally blown me away.... it's 'by far' one of the best VR experience I've had since purchasing my Oculus. The sets and locations are stunning and the gameplay is exhilarating, a word I hardly use for any game. If this is the type of quality and experience we can expect from future VR titles, then the future is very exciting indeed.
