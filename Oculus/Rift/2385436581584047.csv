2022-05-28 20:49:28.219285,Xquatik,"Honestly, Best Sandbox VR Game There Is","I will be honest, I'm a stickler for graphics within VideoGames nowadays - if it isnt smooth, I won't bother buying it. This game however, shocked me. Utterly shocked me. In the beginning I had my doubts, but BoneWorks proved me wrong, in not only the graphical design and storytelling fashion, but everything else! From the smooth and realistic physics engine that makes you feel like the experience is one of your own, to the insanely fitting and overall genius score (credit to the sound wizard that is Michael Wyckoff). This game has truly revolutionised what Virtual Reality should feel like, sound like, be like. Stress Level Zero are un-friggin-believable for what they have done for VR Gaming fans and especially the VR Market, they have essentially set the bar so high for future VR Games/Experiences, that we cannot help but expect out that same level of 'wow factor' out of the big, rich games companies from now on after seeing what a relatively smallish team (in comparison) of dedicated programmers who truly appreciate the craft can accomplish. Hence my undecided vote of this being the best game on the VR Market.

(P.S I highly recommend installing mods for sandbox and the story as soon as you finish the game, it totally revives the experience and keeps on giving. I will link first a youtube tutorial on how to do so and secondly the website that will provide the mods

Tutorial (Downloadable Content) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOhVxKEiZM

Hope this helped, sorry it was long-winded :)",Apr 29 at 12:52 AM,5, 44,
2022-05-28 20:49:28.234245,Mrwolfy12,worth it 100%,"ok ive played it for 2 yrs and idk where i see how many hours.but this game is amazing its quite well optimized too everything is just mindblowing to look at i tried running it with a mobile 1050 non ti and it ran fine little laggy but that was a cpu bottleneck cuz of the heavy phycics calculation the cpu need to do. now i got a gaming pc just cuz of this game i have a 1080 fe. and had a  i5 10400f now for some reason it was chuggy via link and i diddnt know why bc well i have a 1080 
. i then switched to a i7 4790k and it runs at 120 fps all max settings buttery smooth. i love this game my personal favorite. now the mods. some mods are buggy but that may have too do with the phycics nature of the game. the mod config strenght just straight out makes grabbing any sort of pipe or anything other then weapons and npc gliches real hard. now i need the strength mod cuz not being able to yeet a npc trough a window is boring but yes everything is 10/10. and do mind that there will be a while where u will get bored of the game it depends how much u play it generally.",Apr 17 at 2:43 AM,5, 55,

2022-05-28 20:49:31.376839,Silver_Scarab,HELL YEAH,"I played the first hour of this game up to the streets level and found myself bored because I was expecting an action packed game, and then I refunded it.. probably one of the worst desicions i've made. After a couple months I saw videos that made me want to play again, I repurchased it and i'm so glad I did, The music by Micheal Wykoff is one of the best video game soundtracks out there and despite my original issues with full body hit boxes being janky as hell, I ignored it to focus on the brilliant enviorments and immersive moments. Gun play is nice after getting the hang of it, Crablets are a big no no for me still terrifing. game can be scary but i think its because of how realistic it felt. I could go on with this review but what I think should be said is that if you love VR and can handle some intense gameplay I highly reccomend",Jan 24 at 8:18 AM,5, 417,
2022-05-28 20:49:31.392797,LionheartUK,I have to give this one star Currently,Having owned this game for quite some time. Its great to play it was on my CV1. However Currently with the Oculus Quest 2 Via Airlink. The Right controller has the wrong bindings. The trigger does nothing. Selecting menu items happens with B rather than trigger like the left controller. You cant take anything out of the inventory with the right controller and you cant force grab anything with the right controller. Not even shoot. This is not a controller issue as controller is perfect in every other experiance. As there is no way to change or update the binds this is a game issue and not one i can fix making the game unplayable. Will update if a fix is added.,Apr 16 at 2:53 AM,1, 10,
2022-05-28 20:49:31.407756,holeshot123,TAKE MY MONEY STRESS LEVEL ZERO!,This game has become the most played game i own! It has: | a soundtrack that makes me want to cry from how perfect it is | Physics based combat that will keep you coming back to the game long after you have beat the story | a story that feels nice to move through and it ties in will all of Stress Level Zeros other titles | Physics puzzles that are sometimes not the only way to progress like ( intsead of doing the puzzle you could climb to area then jump over the entire thing!) | Sandbox thats insanely fun to go into and play with the physics for awile | Movement that once you get used to can result in some really cool takedowns | Modding is so cool and will add hours and hours of extra playtime | Over all this game is a 10\10 must play and i can't wait for BONELAB.

2022-05-28 20:49:40.879423,MrJasonOZ,Too many glitches but could be amazing,"Way too many glitches for such an expensive game. From falling through floors to barriers getting stuck around your neck. This game is not for people who expect value for money.  It has potential to be a lot of fun but not worth the stress with all the glitches. My son is playing it on HTC Vive pro through steam and he has no glitches so far after over 12+ hours gameplay. So must be a very bad oculus build or untested.

2022-05-28 20:49:47.215476,rennytpla,AMAZING,"The game has realistic physics and player have much because of what you can eliminate enemies in different ways, see this piece of wood? BREAK IT ON THE HEAD OF THE ENEMY. And this can be done with all objects in the game. In the game you can grab everything and everything, you see the fence, but the entrance is too far? Just pull up and get over that fence. Do you have gUN but no ammo? Just beat him with your gUN.In this game, you can put your weAApOns in a bucket and walk freely with them, nothing will fly anywhere. Climbing. BONEWORKS has very interesting climbing mechanics. You can climb pipes, fences, and various surfaces, just like in climb 2, and it's not just for fun, it's an integral part of the gameplay. BONEWORKS also has puzzles, but you almost always have multiple options to solve them. Problems with the elevator? Climb up the pipe leading to the same place. And so with almost all puzzles (I'm not talking about the fact that your elevator always breaks down and you have to crawl through pipes) I love this game too much. (i spent 25 hours playing this game) You will spent 5-7 hours to complete the story, if you look for all the items, then it's somewhere +10 hours.

It is so good. This game has realistic physics, and many weapons and puzzles to do. Many puzzles aren’t too hard to solve, but there are some that require some thinking. I like the arsenal that you can make. You find weapons and items that can be spawned in a sandbox. There are many graphic ways to kill enemies, like impaling them with a spear, shooting their legs then stabbing them, or using a crablet to the face. (A crablet is this vr headset with legs). The graphics are pretty nice, and mods are possible. It also has a story too. Plus an arena where you can fight endless amounts of enemies.

The guns feel great to use because the main developer loves guns so he made them feel great the guns and the physics makes the best gun mecanics I have felt in any other vr game good job.
I hope you add a shotgun to the game because i've wanted to us a realistic shotgun in vr and boneworks seems like the best game to try it on.
The climbing in the game is great because you have an entire interectacteble body making it fun to grab a ledge and then pull yourself up.

2022-05-28 20:50:50.233925,storm.2.exe,Great,"Boneworks is a physics puzzle game where you are able to fight lots of different entities in many different locations.
Pros: In all, this game was pretty good. The weapon physics are really good.
I like the how much of props is in this game. I also like the sandbox mode, Where you can play with physics. I like that there is alot of weapons too. Soundtrack and visuals are amazing. Literally the best game on the Oculus store.
Cons: Not alot of cons though, still good to include them.
 It's a bit glitchy. I get my hand stuck on the outside of a wall sometimes. And the story has alot of puzzles I didn't understand, and the story is confusing.

2022-05-28 20:50:53.349591,Golswor,One of my Favorite VR Games,"This is by far one of the best vr games, and possibly favorite *game* game I’ve ever played.  Everything in this game like the physics, level design, mechanics, lore, and soundtrack is just amazingly executed. It’s a pretty long game, and there are more things you can do after you beat it, like collectibles, sandbox mode, and arena. However I do have some minor suggestions. First of all i think that the debris from the cardboard boxes and wooden crates should be adjusted to make them look like they just broke from the box, instead of making it look like a whole new object coning out of the boxes. Also, some things like the weapon cases i think should weigh a little more, as sometimes when you open them they may fall backwards.

Whatever you thought was the best now takes a second to this. The OST matched with the gameplay together make one of the most complex immersive games to exist. I might have to write a whole seprate review about the musical score. Imagine floating through space laced with an ungodly amount of psycadellics. That is the effect that this games music has on you. The graphics and visuals are insane, the actual physics of the game are incredibly deseigned, and the story itself is a masterpiece. The combination of these aspects produced what can only be called a work of pure genius. Its aweinspiriring, its complex, its beautiful, its BONEWORKS.",Aug 31 at 11:52 PM,5, 56,

2022-05-28 20:51:02.818266,Kombat_Plumber,This is awesome!,"I've only played this for about 12 hours... straight. I looked at my watch after my headset started beeping at me because of low batteries and I couldn't believe it was almost 5 in the morning!?

Pros
1. Gunz!!!!
2. Kill non-human entities!!!
3. PHYSICS!
4. Beautiful world full of stuff to explore/search through.
5. CLIPBOARDS!!!! You'll get it when you start seeing them XD
6. Cool story.
7. AI is pretty good! They WILL bum rush you when they hear you grabbing magazines to reload!!
8. Fun and not too terribly difficult puzzles :)
9. Really sneaky and fun tutorial. You almost don't even realize you're in one at first.

Cons
1. Getting arms stuck because you have no spatial awareness.
2. Can't use your prison pouch. Actually, a backpack or something would be nice. Only having 5 spots to store things sucks. Maybe a fanny pack? Trousers with cargo pockets? 511 Tactical pants. Nah, I get it. Gotta add to the asthetic. It's a flimsy complaint at best.
3. That's about it, I just don't like having a list of 2 things :P

All in all, this game is well worth the money. I'm fairly new to VR and the game didn't make me too terribly uncomfortable at first and it just got better as time went by.",Sep 26 at 7:16 AM,5, 16,

More VR games should use Boneworks as an example when it comes to defining their mechanics and gameplay. Heck the only critique I can really give is something the devs already made a fix for and that was me getting my limbs stuck in objects lol.

I was really looking forward to something on the level of half life alyx after reading and seeing some reviews comparing the two and saying this was better. Lone Echo was way better than this. 

They say a youtuber and a team of 20 people made Boneworks, and you can really tell. I would say its better than other VR games, just not even close to half life or lone echo. I'd rather play onward, pavlov, asgards wrath etc out of all my games id rank this around 10th best. However, if I had played this maybe 2-3 years ago or I had played this as my first VR game, I could see why it was so highly thought of.",Jul 31 at 4:34 PM,1, 7,

2022-05-28 20:51:50.224471,TimeRed,Not very fun,"The campaign is incredibly boring to play because all you do is just walk around and hope you went the right way. The campaign also just feels more like a grind than an actual campaign. The puzzles aren't fun either. The climbing can also be very janky at times. The combat is really good though. You also have to go through the campaign to get items for the sandbox which can take hours just to get a few items. If you could just have everything unlocked for the other gamemodes then this game would probably be a lot better but you're forced to go through the horribly designed puzzles and map layout first.
Overall I just found this game to be really boring and frustrating most of the time. Wish I was able to refund this.",Aug 16 at 4:03 PM,1, 3,
2022-05-28 20:51:50.241426,moonorama,Fantastic VR Game For Any VR User,"Before I had a Rift S I wanted this game so bad. Now that I got one this was the 2nd game I bought. 
       
       Right out of the box, this game is great. You begin to learn how to interact with the world and objects and learn the physics before the main part of the story begins. The physics are incredible. Period. Interaction with the world is fun and you need to be very involved with it. If you are a new user to VR it may be difficult to grasp how to interact with the world. But with practice and gameplay it becomes much easier. 
       The audio and music is excellent and it changes based upon where you are in the game (if you want to listen to the music look up ""Bonetones"" online). 
       You need to solve lots of puzzles and difficult tasks in this game. It gave me the same feeling when playing Portal 2, having to think heavily and really stretch my brain to find a solution. Sometimes it's best to take a short break and clear your mind if it feels overwhelming.
        This game performed really well on my computer (GTX 1060 3gb, i5 4590). I worried I would be unable to run the game, but it ran beautifully. I set shadows to low, 2x MSAA, half textures, and disabled Ambient Oclusion. 
        In terms of motion sickness, I did not feel sick during gameplay. If you have a not good PC the game could lag and make you feel nausous. But in my case I felt fine playing.","May 14, 2021 at 4:47 AM",5, 95,

2022-05-28 20:51:56.584461,Maeday04,A Mixed Bag of a Game,"TLDR: this game is a mixed bag. I played through the entire thing, just to say that I played what amounts to a technical marvel with no personality to it. If a player’s only goal is to finish a game, then the game itself isn’t fun. And what’s the point in playing something that’s not fun 

So. This game was a huge mixed bag, elements of it were fantastic while others fell flat on their face. To make it easier to write my thoughts, I’ll separate it into Highs and Lows. 

Highs: 
- Soundtrack: I’m a sucker for a good soundtrack and holy heck it sounds beautiful. Ethereal tracks for inside buildings and high-octane battle music. It always feels like something is trying to play in the background, which makes the quiet sections of the game even more painful to sit though. I just want to hear the pretty music, not deafening silence while I struggle with the puzzles. That was more of a low I know, I’ve got a couple nitpicks with everything. 
- Body Physics: I’ll give credit where credit is due, the body you have ingame is a technical marvel. It moves the same way your actual body would. It can jump decently, and move decently. All of the guns are weighted to THAT body. Another nitpick here- but while the body was impressive, it didn’t feel good to control. I’m a women of fairly tall build, mainly long legs and arms, and I couldn’t for the life of me feel comfortable using the body. 

Lows: 
- Level Design: okay first off, why the color palette? Everything had the same gray and boring texture, making it virtually impossible to keep track of everything, and the game having a lot of back tracking makes it a hell of a job to move from place to place. 
- Puzzles: now, I know what your going to say . “Oh Mae, is the puzzles too hard for your stupid head to  comprehend?”. To that, I’d say your pretty much correct, but I’d add to that saying the extra things in each puzzle makes them more difficult to solve. Now  to give context to this, there’s one part of the Runoffs section of the game where you have to somehow pull a dumpster into this pit to create a bridge to go to the other side. It’s a fairly small room, and the pit was somewhat close to where the dumpster was. Also in that room is a lever to open a huge garage style door, I saw the door and immediately pulled the dumpster outside and tried for about 20 minutes to pull it over to a ledge earlier in the level. This might have just me being stupid, but for the sake of us stupid people please don’t make your puzzles needlessly complicated. 
- Item Physics: I don’t know why, but everything except for weapons has horrible physics. Like for example, picking up a crate. For a game praised for its amazing physics, it’s a real pain to pick up something and have it spin around like crazy while it flaps into your body. It’s just so weird for a game like this to have problems with its physics. And  still on this topic, why do items like clipboard have to be held in the worst way possible? Is it just me or are they just hard to hold ? 
- Combat: Couple things and I’ll keep it brief, add an hp bar and some visual cues for when your out of ammo. I’d rather not have to guess whether or not my gun needs more ammo, waiting for that little outline of the clip to come suddenly. Also blunt weapons are a complete joke, with the physics the way they are you’re more likely to wake yourself with the mallet rather than a enemy. 
- WorldBuliding: this is also minor, but the monomats need some context. I’m pretty sure they weren’t in the museum, so when I came across one in the Streets I had no idea what it was or how to use it. Maybe to add to the worldbuliding, have a poster  on the side of it explaining how to use one. Nothing fancy but something like “It’s easy! Turning ammo into Money! The system of the future”. I didn’t figure out how they worked until super late into the game, probably another stupid Maeday moment but it still stands 

So in conclusion, this game is a mixed bag. I played through the entire thing, just to say that I played what amounts to a technical marvel with no personality to it. If a player’s only goal is to finish a game, then the game itself isn’t fun. And what’s the point in playing something that’s not fun",Jul 31 at 6:57 PM,3, 1,

Im 39 years old and quite new to VR..... this being said anything that involves motion would give me a slight sickness feeling if the game doesnt offer the ""teleport"" movment.
I unfortunately had to stop playing only after an hour due to feeling unbearably sick. I'll re write the review when i've gotten used to it, in the meantime this is a warning for the older people who arent used to VR!!","Jun 14, 2021 at 12:25 AM",2, 1,

2022-05-28 20:52:28.195912,ManmadeGalaxy83,Pros and cons,"I was originally on the fence about buying this game, since the reviews are fairly mixed, and eventually I got it. I’ve played through most of the campaign, and I decided to write a review.

Pros

Weapons—it’s amazing what the devs did. Each one is as smooth as butter and works exactly like I want them to.

Locomotion—also pretty smooth, but also not for the faint of heart. I’m pretty experienced in VR, so I had no trouble using it. However, if you are prone to motion sickness or are new to VR, don’t buy this game. It’s not as bad as Rec Room, but can still make you sick.

Enemies—fun to fight, as each is different, though a suggestion would be to have the nullmen have weapons like guns or axes so they’re harder to fight.

Levels—fun to go through, and I like that it’s got alleyways and stuff and chests with new guns and ammo. 

Puzzles—fun, yet challenging. I like how you can solve them in different ways than the intended way even if you cheat or do something new.

Slow motion—actually a neat feature. It totally makes you feel like an action hero as you leap into the air, slow-mo, do a 360, all while shooting at enemies with the accuracy and precision of John Wick. I was skeptical of it when it was introduced, but it is awesome.

Cons

Story—they call it a “mysterious narrative”, but as you play it, it becomes more of a confusing narrative. No spoilers, but some of the actions your character does in the story confuses me, and contradicts what the main plot is about. It’d be nice if they actually gave Boneworks a solid story that’s easy to understand. Once I complete maybe I’ll understand it better.

Grabbing things—it’s kind of annoying how you have to use the grip button and the trigger to grab things, but you get used to it.

Enemies—they lack variety and they don’t get stronger. They don’t introduce new enemies into fights to make them tougher, they just throw more of the same in there.

That’s all I have.",2 days ago,5, 241,

I love the secrets in the story that add on to the sandbox mode.  You can do whatever you want. In every other VR story game they have limits and there’s only one way to beat the level. In Boneworks, you can beat the level in virtually any way you can! I have never played a sandbox/ story mode game so much! 100/10.","Feb 8, 2021 at 4:05 AM",5, 200,

Pros-
Good graphics
Great enemies/combat/weapons
Endless replay ability 
Amazing campaign 
Physics and full body 
Fun puzzles
A lot of secrets 
Great soundtrack 
Love how you can interact with anything

Cons-
The story can be a little hard to understand sometimes but if you play Duck Season first and/or watch Game Theory’s videos on Duck Season and this game and you will understand better.

Definitely not for the faint of heart in terms of motion sickness, but love the physics and the sandbox/arena a lot. If the game is still getting updates, I'd reccomend being able to arm enemies with weapons of your choice possibly so you can have gunfights with more than a few kinds of enemies, and maybe add some more arenas/ arena modes.

Pros: 
1. User friendly "" beginner or advanced players""
2. movement is smooth and therefore not nauseating
3. ""FUN""
4. great humor
5. lots of content
6. unique experience
7. heavily styled
8. replayable
9. decent graphics
10. not many bugs
11. weapons handle well
12. physics consistent
13. many more small things you should discover on your own. 

Cons: 
1. combat is lacking difficulty "" only after slowly scaling up ""
2. weapon variety is meh, mostly same weapons with attatchments variable
3. control SETTINGS not customizable , and locomotion controls are awful
4. lacking some puzzle complexity
5. does not utilize mechancs after showing you they exist
6. probably my 2nd biggest issue is variety in enimies

I think praying everynight might be good now, for a sequel. 

Bought this on a whim as a lot of people include it in good vr games but its not really delved into. I wasn't sure what i was getting into because of this. I looked at the oculus video and read the description.  Meh, I jump into it and could tell in seconds it was heavily stylized and was gonna be a cool unique lookking game. 

As soon as the gameplay actuallyh starts its reminiscent of portal , theme, sounds, humor, general feel.  Which when portal came out blew my, and everyone elses, mind. It invoked a bit of nostalgia whilst simultaneously feeling unique. It never feels derivative, but somehow plays familiar.  I can tell you that although its not the greatest game ever made, nor is the one im about to mention: the last time I had this much fun, which is the point of games I think, was Dishonored. 

I was surprised at how quickly it feels natureal to move and interract with the environments and items. This game is jut a blast all the way through to the very last second. I found myself glued to my oculus for several hours at a time. A few times I literally cracked up  laughing so excited and happy about finding things, making stupid easy mistakes, or just finding rad items.","Dec 7, 2020 at 5:52 PM",5, 309,

What it does well:
The guns in this game are smooth as butter, nearly every time I use one it works exactly as expected and is better than any vr game I’ve played so far
It is very replayable unlike many other vr titles 
The graphics are crisp and the game runs smoothly
It feels satisfying to play and do stuff in game
What it does poorly:
Boneworks markets itself as a game for vr experts only and I found that this was just seemed to be a cover up for bugs and wonky mechanics many vr players have started to overlook 
The two most noticeable being climbing and the picking up of heavy objects. Whenever you try to climb it will bob you up and down and temporarily make you loose control of your body and despite this being more realistic to simulate the weight of your body, it isn’t fun.

then you NEED to read this
this game would be a 8 or a 7.5 if there was no modding or anything outside of the game if you hate the story and just wanna play sandbox then just download a save file of a tutorial video and if you want updates go watch a mod video about bonetome the app gives everything like new guns/weapons/customweaponsnpcsmapsgunscode and more and i saw all the comments about i HaTe the story and puzzles when it cleary states about the puzzles. and if you have problems with motion sickness than you shouldint even own a vr and if it wont download then thats not the games fault its probally corrupted files find help and watch a utube vid and you can change controls if you have the steam version idk about oculus 
but my overview of it its a 10 because there so much to do with mods/story and everything in the game everything u can interact with and the graphics and fps run so smooth if u have a pc thats not a potato and one that dosint cost all your orgins. and if you dont like anything about the game change them with bonetome or any other mod source. and i read alot of the 1 star reviews and honestly its just sad how impatient people are. and i understand if the games isint working u dont have to rate 1 star thats not the games fault try and ask for help or try and fix it dont cry about it through ratings. And the people that are just saying its sucks and its sh*t/trolling its because they cant play this game the reason they tried to get is it because its great and it wouldint work for them and if it dosint work refund redowload or switch to steam version and half the people rating one star sound like angry stans on twitter that dont stfu and the people crying about lag its your dogsh*t pc

Comfort is intense and please and take note of that as ive seen videos/reviews of people hating the game because of motion sickness now if you have only got vr this shouldnt be the first game but everything is awesome, from movement to grabbing. (I understand the story fully but to do so you should watch 'game theorists' on youtube. 


Also this game is a sequal to Duck Season but you dont have to play the game to understand everything it just has a few easter eggs 

replayability is ok as the sandbox/ gamemodes are limited but fun 

there are a great variety of enemies (as you proceed) and a great number of weapons 


Highly recommend this game ( before you play, play a game that uses the analog stick NO GAMES LIKE BEAT SABER were you dont move before playing this) 

Remember to not leave negative reviews on story as that can be explained in youtube videos and the story is only part written as it is part of a series the story will be finished in the final game 
And dont leave negative reviews because of motion sickness as it is an INTENSE comfort

2022-05-28 20:53:12.507394,Butthead3000,Its good but could use more content,"This game is ""good"", good means something else for different people so these are the reasons why this game might be good. The game mechanics are simple and easy to understand an at the end of the campaign they introduce some new physics items that have a variety of effects that are expensive. The tutorial is pretty long compaired to other games I have played but it explains how to play to a good degree but misses a very important tip. To use vending machines put clips of ammo into the slot then open the hatch (the required quantity of ammo is consumed upon opening you can get the extra back).

Like another person has said this game doesn't have a solid story (or a story at all to some people) and it mostly revolves around the sandbox an arena modes and these also lack content. This game also has a small range of enemies and guns that work smoothly after a bit of practice but it is missing three very important types of weapons that would make his game far more entertaining and funny: shotguns, explosives and flamables. Another good feaure is a backpack hat can hold secret tiems in the game (excluding guns).

The campaign's main feature is the opening of something called "" Bone crates"" that contain items for the sandbox mode. If you aren't a fan of looking for secret items don't buy it. overall this game feels like a 7.5/10 for me.","Mar 16, 2021 at 1:35 AM",4, 1,

At first I thought it was worse than what I saw but then I starting getting used to this. For some people, It gives them motion sickness but I have not experienced this. I will say some things that you might want to get used to or might not like.

Objects: They feel weird at the start and flimsy but you'll get use to it

Enemys: The combat is difficult with enemys so I prefer to use a gun

Diffiuclty: The game is pretty difficult, I'm on the warehouse map and the others are hard. Later on, you'll be able to learn each enemy and how to kill them faster or easier.

Overall, this game is very fun but I highly recommend you to check the specs and make sure you have them or higher. This game is also for people looking for more combat and puzzels. I would recommend this to a lot of people, but not for newer vr users.","Jan 5, 2021 at 3:18 AM",5, 1,

Now when they said this game is for vr experts i thought i was fine, i have a couple hundred hours in vr, but oh my god they meant it. first 20 minutes of playing i got so sick and thought about refunding but i decided to just pull through and play because i heard so many great things about it. This was the best decision i have ever made when it comes to vr.

This game showed me how immersive single player vr games can be, getting lost in this world was just incredible.

the physics in this game are top notch so it makes for some great and immersive times.

combat is a bit limited but still pretty fun.

puzzles are lacking a bit. there are many ways you can solve the puzzles while not doing it the way intended ( like being able to jump super high by pressing the jump button while also jumping in real life.) i was easily able to pass levels by doing this. 

story is amazing. if you have time there are a few videos by the youtube channel game theory ( yes i know they are a bit cringe) but none of the story is very in your face, you have to do some digging.

no bugs to be honest. except for the fact that the right controls gives out some times.

graphics are great, especially when you use the flashlight.

lots of replay ability.

This game is pretty much flawless if you can over look some small things. please if you love vr check out this game. it is well worth the money and i would pay double for it.

The rest of the levels were amazing and the sandbox/ arena mode is one of the best parts of the game, if u get stuck on a level I recommend putting the headset down and letting ur head clear.

You can unlock new sandboxes, NPCs, Weapons, Gadgets, Props, and more. Even after you beat the game you can try to get a ton of ammo to buy some of the ""dev weapons"" you can get the utility gun, it's the sandbox gun thats spawns all the stuff in, you can get a no clip gun, you can get gravity cups, and more! After you beat the game you can play arena which is also really fun. 

The only really problem is that some people can get stuck on the puzzles, and there is a couple glitches that happen around in the game but it's still 5 stars out of 5 stars in my opinion

Story is extremely long and addicting. You want to stop but you can’t because you’re so close to figuring out the puzzle! I also like how big the map is. Prepare to go into cardiac arrest when you enter the sewers or encounter one of the spider VR headsets. 
It’s a rollercoaster of a journey and after the story there’s so much more to do after the story ends!
Only problem is that the physics weapons cost a LOT of ammo and require you to do lots of grinding to get them. Expanding your sandbox and finding new sandbox locations and battling your way through the arena is so much fun and satisfying.

For £22.99 this is the best money I’ve ever spent. Think about it. Most new games with this much story can cost over £60. For one of the best games I’ve ever played, I can officially say it’s worth it.

Its a puzzle game (half of the stuff you do arent even puzzles but just hard to do with the wanky physics anyways) and its a bad one. I feel like it doesnt even have a genre, its just walking around and trying random stuff until you find your way to the next scene. I would not reccomened this, or even mention it to anyone I know because its a waste of time. If you want a physics-fighting game, go to blades and sorcery or something. If you want a puzzle game, go to I expect you to die. This isn't what is was hyped up to be. It reminds me of douchetubers with the developers attitudes. Its still an ok game (kind of?) but the developers hyped it as something else. The developers dont listen to the community either, and its just pathetic. They really only want the money. Duck season was good, but this was a mistake, stress level 0.","Aug 7, 2020 at 6:22 AM",2, 3,

Then all of a sudden you find an enemy that your not really sure how to fight so you find yourself slapping the guy till hes dead, oh and if you die you lose your guns so expect to slap some more. The game isn't very instructional on where to go to contiue the story most of the time, so you find yourself just wandering around and going in circles. The physics are great and definitely live up to what is said about them, though some things are wonky. To grab an item that is far away you have to press the trigger and the grip, which I understand is like closing your fist, but it feels unnatural. This is how I felt after playing for about 3 hours, but maybe it gets better so I would definitely watch videos of play throughs not just the fun moments that youtbubers post.","Aug 19, 2020 at 4:07 PM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 20:54:41.278962,IkoTheCat,Promising but...,"That's an interesting game that have a lot of good moment but can be very frustrating at times.

I don't get the point of the first level. It's boring and confusing. It nearly got me drop the game. I'm not the first to complain and it really should be redone or dropped completly and begin from The Museum.

There are too many moments I wish I could go back and retry something but there are too many one way path that forces you forward. That's a shame for a game that wants you to try the mechanics and experiment while leaving you hanging without any information but punishes you for going in the wrong direction too early.

Devs also have to understand that we can't all wait 30mn or more for the next check point and people have to be able to quit the game in less than 5mn without losing progress. I once ""lost"" a gun after a save and had to finish the level with my fists which made the game a pain. Sometimes I only have 30mn to play and that's definitively not the game for short sessions. 

The physics are a bit too bouncy for heavy or large stuff and the decision to have most of the body react with the environment made some movement like climbing a real mess. While trying to climb a scaffold I got in an oscillating mouvement and started bouncing up and down like a mad pendullum. I also got stuck in the environment or between multiple movable objects a few times, unable to move, jump or teleport.  I had to revert to the game men, losing my progress.

How can the main USP be the most dissapointing part of the game. I liked the game, but I mean C'MON the whole thing needs work. If your new to VR this is cool to see all the things you can do in VR interaction however, the opening title mentions this is for expert VR users. Most of the physics in the game have been produced way better if you play what I'd consider to be 90% of the games out there. The developers need to play Onwards n get some pointers on gun effects and sound. It's all way to generic and if im honest quite boring. If I can get my money back from Oculus I will.

2022-05-28 20:54:44.468431,t1mok1ng,Physics Playhouse,"I have been incredibly hyped for Boneworks for probably close to a year. Watching videos of gameplay over the months, mixed with the reception of Half Life Alyx, saw me recently build a new PC to invest in the next wave of VR games.

For the first evening (1-2 hours) honestly I didn't enjoy it much at all. It was giving me mild motion sickness and the big open levels had me doing a lot of running about. On top of that, the physics felt way clunkier than how they appeared in videos - it just wasn't the experience I was hoping for.

I plugged in again the next day and after another 1-2hrs the gameplay started to click. I grasped a better idea of how to move my body within the gameworld and became quicker at performing tasks. This improved my enjoyment dramatically as I became more creative with the environment. By the end of the game the controls felt second nature and I was able to run around without feeling ill - trying to throw as much style into my combat as possible.

I wasn't blown away by the story and I didn't feel particulary invested in the world. The pacing and level design felt off at times, with some puzzles more frustrating to complete physically than they were to actually solve. I think the game struggles with it's identity at times, drawing itself uncomfortably close to Half Life but without fully capturing the things that make that franchise great. Ultimately it's a comparison that doesn't flatter and possibly does more harm than good.

It's a shame too, because Boneworks has some great things to offer but it doesn't explore them enough. The physics here (once you get used to them) are absolutely the star of the show but they could have been used in more interesting ways. 

Overall I had a good time with Boneworks and I'll enjoy going in to do the arena/challenge modes some more.  It's an impressive physics showcase that unfortunately doesn't capitalise on it's best ideas. A definite game to try out and play with - just not the killer app I once hoped","Apr 30, 2020 at 10:15 PM",4, 23,

Boneworks is probably if not one if my favorite games out there. There are mostly pros with a couple of cons.

GRAPHICS:
The graphics are really good. It is so good, that the game on the lowest graphics settings still looks amazing. When the graphics are downgraded, sometimes the textures become very blocky, but this is usually for surfaces and walls and stuff like that. 9/10

GAMEPLAY:
The gameplay is better that any shooter or combat I've played. The guns reload realistically, the sharp weapons penetrate objects, and even blunt weapons are satisfying to use.
The weight simulation is very good as well, might I add.
Climbing is fine for the most part, but sometimes limbs might get caught in whatever you are climbing. This happens rarely however, and it has an easy solution to get yourself unstuck.
The campaign mode for Boneworks took me about 8-10 hours to complete, so it is not just a tech demo. Not to mention, after you complete the game you get an arena mode, where you can fight off waves of enemys, do challenges, and other stuff like that.
Sandbox is also a mode that you can unlock, and you get to play around with whatever you have collected in the campaign mode.

Unfortunately Boneworks ignores a lot of advice made by other VR dvelopers when it comes to locomotion and as a result, I can get like 30-40 mins tops of gameplay before I'm feeling pretty sick, and it takes over an hour for me to feel normal again.

It's a shame because the concept of the game and the detail put into the physics is outstanding.  I'm not sure I can recommend it, not unless they introduced some options to make it less vomit inducing.

As a comparrison, I completed Half Life Alyx and didn't feel sick once, it's all down to how locomotion is handled, especially vertical and horizontal in combination which just leaves my stomach behind.","May 8, 2020 at 11:00 PM",3, 2,

Keep in mind I have an oculus quest with link and a non supported 750 graphics card. All I did was lower the graphics and it still looks amazing! (Also I think all VR games should have graphics settings.) Plus the physics in this game are on a different level of insanity! Just being able to pick up a broom and see the bristles bend when pushed against the floor would be such a mundane task but in VR it shows that the development team really worked hard on this game. In summarization this is a great game, totally recommend it.","Apr 15, 2020 at 9:28 PM",5, 3,

People complaining about jank clearly haven’t gotten past the learning curve of having an actual body and an actual presence (no ghost hands etc.) the one janky thing that becomes a problem after the learning curve is guns clipping on your head, but it’s not too big a deal. Movement in this game is phenomenal, it feels really good running around and interacting with things, breaking glass and getting over obstacles, great job slz. The interaction possible is great and really gives a sense of presence, Heavy objects are heavy and you have to treat them like they’re heavy or your bound to have a hard time, moving things feel real. The physics mean that any problems can be solved with creativity, if it could be done irl you bet you can do it in boneworks, crouch jumping makes you jump higher too, god the game is an absolute blast and your guaranteed a smile.

2022-05-28 20:55:06.707949,StemForeal,Very dissappointed,"I bought this game about 2 weeks ago. It was 5-star awesome for the first couple days. They pushed a new update that effectively turned the game into a non-playable brick. The update removed the abilities of crouching and jumping, both of which are extremely necessary to play the game. I made it halfway through the game, and now it is completely unplayable and I'm just stuck with no recourse. 

I have the exact recommended hardware and settings and the game worked flawlessly until those knuckleheads ""updated"" it. I even deleted it all and completely reinstalled it from scratch and still no change. These folks basically just stole $32 and change from me.

There are plenty of people like me who have pointed all this out here in the oculus reviews, along with steam reviews and reddit, and yet the developers still haven't rolled the update back, they haven't pushed a new update to fix their flawed one that broke the game, and worst of all, I haven't seen even one response from the developers apologizing for their slack oversight, or letting their customers know that they are aware of the problem and fixing it. I get the impression that they just flat-out don't care that they have screwed a bunch of people that spent money on this game.  

I paid $32 anticipating having a cool new game, but I just got teased with a cool new  game for a couple days, and then they took it away from me and stole my money. This had the potential to be a 5-star game, but now I'm giving it 1-star regardless of whether or not they respond or fix their problems, because this has already left such a bad taste in my mouth. This game in its current state is not only not worth $32, it is not worth paying even one cent for; it is unplayable. I feel scammed.

Having a body in vr just gets in the way more than anything, like trying to pick something off a table, then it flips because the game thinks your virtual knee is sticking out, is just a pain in the butt.  And the jumping doesn't work half the time as your fee get in the way.  All this makes for physics puzzles that are more annoying than fun.  It feels like a proof on concept for a future game.

2022-05-28 20:55:09.906394,Tekohusky,Fantastic VR experience,"I have been using VR for a couple of years now so I feel that I should add my two cents. Ryzen7 2700x 16gb ram 2060 Super

I have played Blade & Sorcery, Robo Recall, Pavlov VR and other previous titles and I was hesitant to buy this game, but after Half Life Alyx came out and just brought complete and utter sadness, I purchased this (It was half the price!).  I don't regret it at all.  

I love being able to grab, climb, interact with objects, use weapons, USE the weapons as a helping hand when climbing or breaking things or melee against enemies.  Blade & Sorcery got the climbing physics down, but this game pretty much is its competition, though the sword fighting mechanics in B&S are better, melee weapons in this game are a little clunky (Like swinging balloons).  The gun mechanics are perfect, especially compared to Pavlov VR.  I REALLY wish Half Life Alyx adopted Boneworks physics, you can't do anything in Half life Alyx in comparison, its like Robo Recall in terms of mechanics, but visually it is great (And so is Boneworks).  The story takes a few play throughs to actually get it down, but if you beat the game and didn't pay any attention to the story (Its VERY vague) You can always go online to a forum for the lore.  A lot of people complain about having to play through the ""Tech Demo"" in order to unlock Arena or Sandbox, but IMO, I actually enjoyed the playthrough and don't care much for the sandbox or arena.

If you truely want to experience VR physics, PLEASE buy this game, you can't go wrong with the price.. it is an absolute STEAL.  I don't play the Arena or Sandbox (Unlocked both) because I enjoy B&S more for that aspect.  Tons of people hate on Boneworks, I can understand a few complaints such as:

-Weapons getting stuck in chainlink fences
-The Clip getting ""Jammed"" in the machine gun
-Motion Sickness (This is a given, this game is great for people with VR legs, not beginners)

Levels
Most of the levels are visually very similar, and the only really memorable levels were the museam and the fantasy land.
Puzzles
The puzzle design is a glitch mess, and most of the time it isnt puzzle design as much as ""look everywhere until you find the solution"" design.
Physics and the Body
The physics engine, while interesting and allows for a lot of interesting things, is buggy as hell. Your body is also a nightmare, with your arms sometimes getting stuck inside stuff which takes a bit of craftyness to get out. Also, climbing is a messy nightmare that makes you want to die.
Enemies
The enemies are all very similar. There are pretty much 3 types of enemies: 
Ones that shoot projectiles, Ones that just melee you slow enough you can just sprint away from them, and the little  robo spiders. All are easy to take out but very annoying in large numbers.
Weapons
Every weapon exept for guns makes you feel like a 10 year old kid fighting his friend with a balloon sword. All of the melee weapons but the knives all feel like garbage. Fightfighting is cool but super weak.
Story
There is barely a story, but what they do set up is sort of interesting. It plays with the fact that you have barely any information.

But everything else, while good enough and impressive for a small team, isn't the top tier experience it was made out to be in the community. It felt very indie, in not the best way, like their reach exceeded their grasp. Like they wanted to make a AAA experience but didn't have the resources so it feels like a full-length shell with not enough filling. It could have been fine if the story was compelling but it was thin and made very little sense. Why was anything in this world they way that it was? the enviornments, the enemies, the regualr real-world guns; no explanation that I could surmise. On top of that, the perfromance isn't well optimised and ran poorly on my system that typically can run most anything very well.

I 've seen enough (cheap) physics applications
The cluncky grabbing, jumping, bending over to grab things from the ground are bugged at best
Snap turning with a ""container"" (i.e. a bucket/small crate) in your ""hand(s)"" makes the bolts at the bottom fly out all over the place and needs a lot of work still.  The avatar turns so  violently, you'd think it's having an epileptic seizure or, late stage Parkinsons' disease
DEV(s?) responsible for this (tutorial?)
""Your programming is correct, but your physics is atrocious."" (paraphrasing Albert Einstein)

I always miss the ""long"" jump by a (virtual) millimeter
Then, to get back to that 2nd gap is so annoyingly easy, but grindy, and generally  a total waste of time
Jumping through ""hoops"" by no means add the intellectual challenge that puzzles are supposed to be
Being ""forced"" to play through totally irrelevant content merely adds to the annoyance
It's just put there to waste some time and give the player the idea the game takes longer. Which it does, of course, by forcing the player to waste time on sh.. ehm stuff that doesn't add any enjoyment to the game
The physics ""challenge"" here is ""bend ur knees b4 u jump"", but I just seem to be too short to jump all the way over

2022-05-28 20:55:29.018277,YourFavFem,"Great game, but...","I've bought Boneworks about 4 days ago and when i got the game at the beginning i noticed a lot of stuttering and lags even tho i have a really and i mean a really good gaming Laptop. The only recommended thing i was missing from my pc was a i7 7700k processor, while i've had a i7 7700hd. The game concept is great, but when you have these FPS and stutter issues it is unplayable and unenjoyable. Another issue i have with the game is you get lost so often, when you try to finish a level sometimes you just dont know where to find certain things, like a key and that would make you search for 30 minutes until you find the answer.","Mar 28, 2020 at 1:16 AM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 20:55:32.152892,taquitobuddy,Incredibly over-rated even for tech demo,"I've played ALL the major VR games released to date, and I went into this one with only moderate expectations despite the hype.  I was basically expecting a Blade and Sorcery-style physics sandbox, except with guns and a narrative/puzzle campaign.  Instead, this plays more like VR QWOP.  Everything about it is incredibly janky and clunky.  In something like QWOP or Surgeon Simulator the jankiness is intended and is supposed to be funny.  Here it is just frustrating and makes an already boring game even worse.  Nothing is explained properly, maybe to encourage you to explore on your own.  That would be fine, except exploring is, like everything else here, slow, boring, and clunky.  

I honestly tried to give this one a fair shot, but having spent  maybe 2 hours, I'm not sure I can bring myself to play anymore - it is just that tedious.  Maybe this game was meant to be played on the Index and isn't so terrible there.","Feb 28, 2020 at 11:00 PM",1, 37,

It has some relitivly long load times which are sadley just black screans but the games good enough to where i dont mind much and the later levels are long enough to where you kinda forget abouit the wait at the start and end of it. Over all really nicely done and the full phisics envorments and character make the world feel  far more tangible and emersive.","Mar 5, 2020 at 12:12 PM",4, 2,

My Initial Impressions
Boneworks is a MASTERPIECE in VR Physics, Design and Interaction.
I've seen all the trailers and was a little bit worried going into this game that it would just be a glorified tech demo. It certainly is a tech demo, but an amazing one at that. Being able to interact with everything is a monumental achievement for VR.
I am no longer worried about Boneworks, I'm more worried about up and coming games lacking these amazing physics and interactions.","Feb 21, 2020 at 7:21 AM",5, 157,
