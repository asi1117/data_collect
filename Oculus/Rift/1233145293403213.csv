2022-05-28 16:17:15.098487,Hungus1975,Great for tennis practice,"The physics are great and if you're a tennis beginner, this is excellent for practicing your forehand and backhand in your living room. 
If you turn off the annoying ball people (press O on keyboard), you can concentrate just on your strokes and footwork. 
In terms of being an actual game, it could use a bit more content.","Jul 10, 2019 at 3:15 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 16:17:15.114444,VibrationsOfDoom,**UpdateOctober of 2021,"** UPDATE **

Re-writing my review once again, as I have been picking this up more and more lately... Still my go to game for tennis, since I can't seem to find tennis partners anymore, this does it for my indoor exercise... Not much to say really, apart from adding a menu screen to this I can't think of much more they need to do. The game is solid and almost bug free... You'll get a real understanding of real-life tennis physics; as I stated in my last updated review my backhand has gotten SOOOO much better... I plan on going to play tennis in real life in Savannah to see how the VR tennis skills translate to realtime...

I also said in a past review that I wish the racket had a bit more power, but with the Violin ""powerup"" and a few other rackets this is okay. Sometimes you get a good workout trying to aim at the hearts and tennis ball headed people... Still one of my popular go to games for a workout, that and Elven Archery...

Actually, now that I think about it, there are a few things you could do that would enhance it. Have the day slowly switch to night and have court night lights come on, maybe even give us the option to save the ""high scores"" you get for continuous rally and number of hearts collected... However, I see why that isn't implemented, but make it so you can save or reset the scores every session. Powerups would be harder to get if you had to keep ""beating your score"" every time... Fantastic game that a few years later I still spend lots of time on...

Kudos to the reviewer below that pointed out you could hit the letter O on your keyboard to turn off the ball headed people...",Oct 14 at 2:32 PM,5, 3,
2022-05-28 16:17:15.129404,cybernettr,The cutest VR game ever!,"I’m 55, and this game made me feel like a kid again. Every time I accidentally knocked down one of the avatars I broke out laughing! I played another VR tennis game which also had good graphics, but that wasn’t first person, this one is, and to me, first person is what VR is all about! Caution: even though the game will automatically position you in the right place to hit the ball each time, you do need a decent sized play area, at least large enough to swing your arms around wildly, and even better if you can take a step left or right.","Apr 16, 2019 at 5:10 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 16:17:15.158327,Nukemarine,Only VR can improve on wall ball tennis,"Back in the early 80s, I played a Pong clone video game at home quite a bit. One thing I remembered doing was playing both sides. Now, almost 40 years later, we're have the surreal VR version of that.  Or, as my title points out, it's almost like playing tennis against a wall with all the weird benefits VR offers. Throw in spectators with tennis balls for heads, weird power ups, interactive tennis court and various ball and racket upgrades for fun. 

Wouldn't have paid full price, but the value of the game easily surpasses the $6 sale price.","Dec 30, 2017 at 9:17 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 16:17:18.293940,nrosko,Boring,"It's not great tbh, i have no idea why anyone would rate this 5 stars. You can play tennis with yourself you can do a bunch of novelty VR activities. The surreal enviroment is cool but nothing really changes. If you are easily entertained by novelty phone apps its about at the same level so you might enjoy it.","Jan 20, 2018 at 3:41 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 16:17:18.308900,datablob,Not worth it,"Bought it on the basis of good reviews, it's not very good. The characters emit very annoying noises, there's no way to balance out the sound to a pleasant level. The gameplay is not really there, the physics feel meh. At best a tech demo, not at all worth the current price.","Jan 4, 2018 at 11:34 PM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 16:17:18.323860,ninjaman89,Adorably Bizarre,"I cant say this is a game for everyone.  I can only hope it is.  This is one of those 'only in VR' experiences.  You play tennis against yourself, the field and POV switching when the ball crosses the net.  And you are a Unicorn.  2 unicorns technically.  The court is floating above a giant megacity and the judges, ballpeople, and gallery are all... Tennis ball people.  They like to dance like freaks, are horrible at being ballpeople, and prefer to instead ride on each others shoulders, occasionally donning tophats, and run onto the court.  They will climb the various architecture surrounding the court for what I can gather as no real reason and tip toe on the edges of everything dangerous.  From what I can see there are a large number of unlocks (which I havent figured out how it works completely, just got done playing my first session) and of course a selfie stick.  I dont want to spoil the fun so I will leave the rest up to your imagination but I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants a chill fun 'do whatever you want' experience thats unique and delivers quality controls and performance.","Dec 30, 2017 at 1:41 PM",5, 4,
