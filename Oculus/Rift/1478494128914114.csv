Funny commentary while playing as well (although it did get a little old after a while--wish there were some level-specific lines). It is perhaps a little short and repetitive for the full price, but if you can find it on sale, I'd say go for it!","Sep 6, 2019 at 11:25 PM",4, 0,

I have only seen two of the levels so far but they are nicely done and different. The enemies are not varied so far (one guy and one girl model with various clothes), but they run around a bit shoot and throw dynamite at you to mix it up. You can buy a range of weapons (pistols, shotguns, rifles, spear guns, mini guns, sawed off shotgun, maybe a couple fo more) and upgrade the weapons as well.

My only complaint is you need to unlock levels for the quick fight mode by completing a set number of waves from the previous level in the ""campaign"" mode. I personally prefer to just have access to all of the content from the start.

Overall I feel like I got a bargain getting this at $5, well worth it.","Sep 21, 2018 at 11:49 AM",4, 7,
