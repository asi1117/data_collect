This is one of the few VR games to actually have multiplayer with voice chat support. I was using the new Oculus Quest 2 with Virtual Desktop, and I was able to use all the functionality perfectly. I can't wait to see what other game modes will be come available in the future.","Feb 22, 2021 at 10:12 AM",5, 3,
