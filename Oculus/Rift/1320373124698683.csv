2022-05-28 17:07:15.989691,WickedInsignia,Lack of graphics settings,"A neat little modeler with a lot of potential that I cannot recommend due to a complete lack of graphics options. Antialiasing and dynamic lighting are always on and my PC turns into a pizza oven in even an empty scene. Completely unnecessary in a creative app, with no option to turn it off.

Please implement graphics options so those of us with lower spec (or summer climates) can benefit. I have no issues with Medium/Gravity Sketch/Quill/Tilt Brush.","Jun 13, 2020 at 12:21 PM",1, 24,

2022-05-28 17:07:16.018613,Ethan,Awesome for what it is,"I have seen many reviews saying it crashes after a while. I think this app shouldn't be expected to be used for long periods of time, it is merely a simple model creator. I have not ran into any problems, and being able to import images is really nice. If you want more from it, get a different app. Adding a component of animation would be awesome, just some auto key frames, nothing too much. Like I said, it's great for what it is.","Oct 20, 2019 at 10:48 AM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 17:07:16.034570,SamuelAB,Love this buggy app,"I love this app.

However there are a few improvements to be made on the Rift. With the latest update (4.0.0O), I am unable to log in. Two updates ago, the app would crash when saving. There are also no support forum, so communication is minimal.

When you don't wear the headset, the screen flashes constantly. To select colors, you have to twist your hand in the most uncomfortable way. This makes me wonder if the developpers only test on Vive controllers and if they have a QA list to check off, like loging out and in.

Overall, I love being and doing art in Blocks. I wish there was more support and communication for Rift owners. I can't wait to see how it evolves.

-

UPDATE - Now I cannot log in and there is no support..... I may have lost years of VR artwork and this app is no longer being updated. Very annoying to have zero communication from the developpers, no way to contact support for major flaws and no updates.","Oct 10, 2019 at 5:01 AM",1, 12,

2022-05-28 17:07:28.631877,CaitlynXx,"Easy, fun, low-poly geometry","There is power in having a limited toolkit and palette and Blocks plays to that. It's fun, fast, and produces low poly geometry.  Being blocky by nature and confined to a certain range of colors, things made with Blocks tend to fit nicely together.  Combined with the Blocks repository of UGC, it's very easy to quickly hash out a 3D space.  Because it's low poly, your work will render quickly in any vr or game engine, like High Fidelity or Unity.","Sep 17, 2017 at 1:16 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 17:07:28.646837,JadeKVR,JadeKVR reviews Google Blocks,"First time gameplay on the YouTube channel at JadeKVR. -  

Blocks is a creativity app by Google VR, available for both the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Blocks lets you easily create 3D objects in virtual reality, using six different tools. The app is so simple to use that anyone can just jump in and create in a matter of minutes. The app offers a simple and quick tutorial so that the use is immediately familiar with the six tools available. If you wish to you can save or publish your creations. The app is not only ideal for VR creatives, but would also serve as a great introduction to creating virtual environments, for younger users, or for someone with limited time to create. Unleash your imagination and creativity in the Virtual world.","Dec 14, 2017 at 5:30 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:07:28.661797,Brengles_Beard,Great!,"This is a great low poly modeller. It seems too basic at first, but it just means that you have to be more creative. Just look at the galleries to see that there is plenty you can do.

Some features that I would like to see added in no particular order (and which may already exist but I just don't know how to do it):

- Infinite canvas 
- Edge dissolve
- Joining objects
- Merging vertices
- Inset faces
- Knife tool
- Make the minimum sizes for objects much smaller
- Loop cuts","Jul 28, 2017 at 1:21 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 17:07:28.676757,mrjimmyos,3D artist point of view,"I've only spent a few minutes with this so this is to be taken with a grain of salt but I wanted to give my point of view. I've tried tilt brush and that's been really fun to use but I've wanted something more 3D model oriented and this seems to be it. There's a ways to go but you can do a decent amount with what's here right now and I imagine google will keep adding to this. I've been a blender user for about a decade now on and off and I think this could be a really nice addition to the mouse and keyboard way of modeling (it saves .objs with colours in an .mtl file in D:\Users\YOURNAME\Documents\Blocks\Models\zbbnck). It's a different and more artistically oriented way to model and it's more accessible too which is nice in itself. Will keep an eye on this one and probably use it for tubular extrusions and block out work. 

P.S. do check out the featured models, really shows off what can be done and you can see how cool it is to view models with the scaling method that tilt brush has (via holding the inner triggers and dragging the controllers apart/together)","Jul 7, 2017 at 3:44 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 17:07:31.759512,tejasdude,Good basic low polygon modeler,"A good basic modeler for someone with no experience in 3D modeling which I believe is the main purpose of the application (ease of use). My suggestions for a few things to add in this free version would be a inset tool. The ability to select multiple edges to cut at one time plus selecting multiple faces, edges or vertices to move/extrude.  I would be willing to pay for a more advanced modeler. There could be the free version (limited) and a more advanced paid version for experienced artist.
Edit:
Thanks for the response. I added a star. I would suggest including about selecting multiples faces, edges and vertices in the next tutorial. I did not even try as the tutorial only showed copying objects.","Jul 12, 2017 at 8:23 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 17:07:31.774472,Numloch,Fantastic Low Poly modelling,"This is a deceptively simple looking low-polygon modelling tool which makes you think about keeping things low-poly for VR sake. The 6 tools have additions which allow you to be more creative than it initially appears. There is a level of complexity which can be achieved if you spend more than 5 minutes with this app. This is a must for all people interested in 3D modelling in 3D, it is so intuitive and allows you to ""virtually"" touch and alter your model. I can't recommend this highly enough as a starting entry into the world of modelling.","Jul 29, 2017 at 12:38 PM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 17:07:34.915072,romanguro,it's OK.. but,The lack of tools is a big problem here. Even for low-poly modeling this is not enough,"Aug 29, 2017 at 7:11 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 17:07:34.930032,DaniBittman,What I've wanted since last year,"It's simple, but thats why it's appealing to me. There's less confusion around how to use the tool, and more focus on just creating. Plus, even though things in Blocks may seem low poly and ""toyish"", they have a lot of profesional potential once brought into an application like Unity. rendering does more to an object than one might think... Still buggy, I experience frame drops every so often, but honestly I don't care, I can now 3D model with my hands instead of using a mouse on a 2D screen. Frame drops are a million times less annoying to me than using a mouse.","Jul 9, 2017 at 3:11 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 17:07:34.944992,lillybaeum,So close!,"More intuitive than Medium definitely, but slightly less powerful overall. Something's missing. Most frustrating elements are how imprecise/touchy the stroke painting option is, the fact that the tutorial doesn't go over stroke painting or many other elements clearly enough, etc.. overall feels like an alpha version that they wanted to get out in the wild because they were excited over what they had. Rightfully so, but still a little underdeveloped, and I hope this thing does have a renaissance soon, I just don't think it'll happen in its' current state, regardless of how cool it is.","Jul 9, 2017 at 4:11 PM",4, 2,

After that, I jumped into the game, and began to make some objects. That part went great, and I really like the tools/objects that you can use. Upon finishing my creation, however, I looked around for a screenshot button, but could not find one.
