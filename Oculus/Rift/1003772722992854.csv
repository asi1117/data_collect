Really well made, fantastic frame rate and beautiful colors.  And free flying, without doing any missions, is the best ""meditation app"" available for VR.","Mar 11, 2021 at 8:14 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:02:51.608160,Jadon,"15 Days w/ Ubisoft Support, Not Worth It","I purchased the game on clearance for $5, but Ubisoft's copyright protection will not allow the game to activate which will require you to email customer support.  After going back and forth a dozen times over the course of 15 days with their support staff who just sends scripted answers that will not work.  They eventually manually added the game to my Ubisoft account after I had to take multiple screen shots of my reciept and game folders and attempted to follow their instructions of clearing a cache file which does not work.  All that work and it's not even that good of a game.  

The multiplayer server does not work for Oculus.  The graphics are locked into Playstation VR's ultra low resolution for all cutscenes, and it's runs poorly for such low polygons and texture detail.  Worst of all the game play is extremely repetitive.  You do the same mission of either flying through rings or shooting down other birds over and over again, that's all there is to the game.  You can beat the game in around 3 hours, but if you played it for 15 minutes you've already seen it all.  Also, there are no settings adjustments, I wish you could remove the bird's head from your POV and stop the vignetting whenever you're close to an object.","Dec 12, 2020 at 1:42 PM",1, 21,

My major issue is that after the 45 minutes required with support to get the game working there is no option to disable the stuffed eagle's head they stick under your cam but there's also no option to deactivate what I can't describe otherwise than a simulated cerebral commotion as it sometimes decides that you just shouldn't have periferal vision!!

2022-05-28 15:02:54.755741,EpiXRGames,What a ride - without even playing it,After downloading there have been authentification issues with UPlay that you will need to create an account for in order to play the game. UPlay basically said that I don't own the game and closed it before I could play anything. I got the game with a discount so I thought okay I just gonna buy it a second time on UPlay so the authentification could not fail anymore. Oh boy was I wrong. Creating the account was annoying as hell as they managed to program a website that litterally didn't load 7 out of 8 times. The email verification had a very similar success ratio and took literally forever. As I finally finished all the signups I continued to buy the game (a second time on their platform). Buying it surprisingly worked as expected until the point where I had paid everything and received a message that the game will soon be available in my library... Soon? On an online platform? Anyway... I waited... for around 30 min... to receive an email... with a registration code for the game (not the game in my library). I copy and pasted the activation key just to figure out that it was NOT working. I tried a couple of times but the key is surely not working on their store... so who know what they actually sent me. Not willing to purchase the game a third time it was finally time to accept defeat... Which now leaves me with 2 copies of the same game that are NOT working and I haven't even seen the menu screen yet. Anyway at least I got a good 45 minutes of doing something from the 2 purchases which leaves me with a praytime of very annoying 45 min in total and the strong impression that this will be the last Ubisoft game I ever purchase. If you decide to buy the game I wish you good luck with it and hope that you will be more successful than me.,"Dec 23, 2019 at 7:06 PM",1, 46,

This solved the problem for me, but it took tech support over two weeks and a refund request from Oculus to suggest this to me, so minus two stars for that. Minus one star because the game gets boring rather quickly. It's easy to control and the missions are all different excuses to fly through certain ""hoops"", at least an hour into the game. The graphics are mediocre but I do like the recreation of the city. It's just not enough to keep me interested in the game. Glad I got it on sale.","Jan 14, 2020 at 6:24 PM",2, 7,
2022-05-28 15:02:54.785662,nnsense,After 4 days I still didn't play it,"4 days since I've rised the ""authentication of ownership"" issue to ubisoft and no answer yet. This is really annoying. I've bought the game on the Oculus store, and another platform is preventing me to play the game I've bought. This relaying of one platform on another is disturbing, why not doing like steam, you buy the game there, not on Oculus just to be forwarded to Ubisoft (which is NOT working, not only for me but for many other users!).
I cannot review the game since I cannot start it!! As many here I've tried Ubisoft support chat with no luck, it keeps disconnecting me and no answer on the ticket.

2022-05-28 15:03:01.072845,MVShaw111,"Boring, half baked controls and concept","The concept is cool but not executed well. The environment is done fairly well but the controls are very lacking, as you can only use the xbox controller. The only thing you can do is turn your head to steer, climb or dive and only the trigger on the controller does anything [give a slight speed boost]

Also, the ""eagle"" looks more like looking out the hole of some kind of eagle kite. What's up with the ""feathers"" above the eagle's head?...they simply look very out of place and limit your vertical FOV 

You can't look around while flying without steering [moving in that direction, which seriously confines your sense of being an eagle and absorbing the scenery. I feel like an Eagle wearing blinders who's head is somehow locked to its steering ""rudder"". If there were simply the option to temporaraly unlock the look to steer the experience would be improved.

This feels more like an unfinished work in progress to me guys.

There needs to be a free look, no feathers above the eagle's head, and definitely more controls, and more maneuvering control, like the ability to land on buildings and use ""eagle vision"" to zoom in and target/track moving objects or catch prey in your talons.

Bottom line, this feels like an early demo if the potential of vr.

As far as the Ubisoft thing. I already had Ubisoft installed and simply had to hit the A button to link it up to launch.","Apr 2, 2019 at 10:48 AM",2, 12,

My Thoughts:
It was a big surprise to discover this game had a solo player campaign. I was always under the impression it was multiplayer only.
Flying in VR is amazing and the quality of this title makes it even more so. I was smiling like a Cheshire cat diving in and out of the city and environments. Surprisingly the game world reminded me of 'I am Legend' featuring Will Smith.

2022-05-28 15:03:04.202475,MillenniumGhost,Almost Perfect,"The only thing holding this game back is an annoying prompt to login to an external Uplay account (which is really a minor hiccup if you love the game as much as I do).

Everything else is flawless.  Somehow, Ubisoft figured out how to do the flying thing without inducing any VR sickness.  And because of that, this is THE BEST flying game for VR.  The story mode is pretty straightforward, allowing you to take racing, collection and falcon attack challenges at random throughout a fully replicated Paris (which has a breathtaking amount of detail for VR).  But just simply flying around the city is never a dull experience.

There is also a cross platform (PSVR and Vive I believe) multiplayer option but since this game seems to be outside of most peoples' radar right now, I've never had any luck starting a match.

Ubisoft, REMOVE UPLAY LOGIN, and I will add a fifth star.  Also, if anyone at Ubisoft is reading this, MORE CITIES/SEQUELS, PLEASE!!!","Oct 12, 2018 at 6:14 AM",4, 22,

Nevertheless it is a fun game with plenty of mileage in it - the method of flight where you tilt your head to turn works really well - particularly as the more you tilt the faster you turn.  There is a technique to it which takes practive.

The game is simplistic but fun.  There are tons of missions which slowly increase in difficulty - some have you flying through hoops in the fastest time possible whilst others have you collecting objects.  I guarantee you will spend a lot of time pulling your hair out looking for that one missing object.","Mar 7, 2018 at 4:11 AM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 15:03:07.377981,Killmore101,UPlay,"I simply cannot recommend any game that has UPlay - the game does not even start because of it.

Edit1: I am getting the ""Unable to authenticate ownership of product"" through Uplay. Still unable to play game after contacting Uplay/Ubisoft. Refund is not available for this game and there seems to be no way to contact Oculus regarding this issue. I would advise: Buyer beware.

Edit2: I did manage to find a link to create a ticket with Oculus and they have responded with some basic information such as ensuring the Oculus store is installed as well as the Uplay client then running Eagle Play but I am still getting the authentication error.

After Googling the issue, it appears to be a common problem. I am not sure if the issue is caused by Oculus or Uplay but I don't appreciate being in the middle of it.

Edit3: Finally got the game working by providing proof of purchase to Ubisoft and, in turn, they manually added the game to my Uplay library. But this was only after 6 emails of following steps which included a lot of ""delete this, delete that, reinstall this...etc"". It was indicated to me that part of the issue may have been attributed to the fact that my Uplay and Oculus are installed on drive C while my Oculus library is on different drive. I suggest any who are having this issue to simply go through Ubisoft and follow their directions (aka jump through some hoops). I'm liking the game (except for the FOV blocker) but will not change my rating because of Uplay. FINAL EDIT: For those of you who want full FOV (no blinders), modify the savegame info located in your Registry as follows: Open Regedit and backup your registry. Navigate to: [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Ubisoft\Eagle Flight], Open key ""XXXXXXXXXXXXX_SaveGame_XXXXXXXXXXXX"", which is the savegame file. Edit this by searching for ""blinders"" and replace the following ""true"" with ""false"". Credit: Atlan20062007.","Nov 21, 2017 at 9:59 AM",1, 27,

2022-05-28 15:03:20.088984,feldenstein,This one,"Since it dominates the reviews here let me first address the whole Uplay thing. Yes, it's the stupid work of stupid managers who are sadly making far more money (for themselves in salary, surely not for their company!) than the wonderful people who actually made this lovely game. And I can't speak to people who had difficulty with the game working, or with Uplay. I had no problems, but I won't dismiss these complaints, though I question some of the people bothering to write a review of fury based on the way too simple condemnation: ""Requires Uplay"".

The fact is that thereare still some somewhat slim choices for games on this incredible device, the rift. And as for games making smooth, real use of VR, being fully realized and understanding the joy of the thing they're dealing with, I don't have a long list. This game has joined that list. Lovely, smoothly working, charming, and oddly immersive (""I'm an eagle!!"") it is one of my most succesfull purchases here in VRland. You play an eagle, fly around Paris by moving your head, you do stuff... flying stuff... There's a story mode. The whole thing is not over in an hour. It's Paris as an attractive ruin, with animals! And you're in it.

To me the Rift is a way to play games that adds about 30 points to an out of 100 score. What would Eagle's Flight be as a 2D game? A cute indy game worth maybe 55 out of a hundred. Translated well, as a VR game it becomes something more like an 85 and ranks up there with Lone Echo and I Expect You to Die as my favorite games.

That said, I don't like the 1-3 star ratings on the ""missions"" and would rather play through the game in a more open world story mode without the arcade affectations. I haven't tried multiplayer and never will, and I haven't finished the game. I bought it on sale for 20 dollars. I think I'd still like it for more, but... full price would be pretty steep.","Sep 25, 2017 at 1:11 PM",5, 8,

Game has  great use of VR , The free flight is worth checking out on its own. Not sure what the immertion breaking tunnel effect even means, its not destroyed the game play like others would have you believe. Sometimes I wonder what hate train the internets on but its nothing new. I'm only a few missions in but felt it I need to give you a more balanced oppinion. 

So, game works fine.
Great VR experience.
Logging into uplay no a probelm.(takes longer loggin in to sream VR for me)

2022-05-28 15:03:23.184704,Aquavemo,Fly and relieve your neck tension!,"I did not expect that just flying around and exploring the wonderful looking city of paris would be so much fun. There is actually a lot to explore and to see in the open world, which was bigger than i thought. The relatively short and very simple story mode gives you 23, somewhat varied missions and even an ""end boss"". I liked the flying missions, but the fights can get confusing and even a little hard later in the game.
Some other points to consider:
1 - Requires uplay (I don't mind)
2 - You have to get used to tilting your head, instead of just looking left/right. (Good thing, you can set the sensibility of that)
3 - There is a dark ""border"" around your field of view when you turn or fly fast or get close to a wall/ground. Very distracting for me.
4 - Having ""feathers"" on top of your vision (to feel more like tan eagle?) was not the best idea.
5 - I got this 50% off, i would consider the full price a little too much.

Besides these points, i really enjoyed this game. I never got closer to the feeling of flying like a bird. Just a great experience made possible by VR! I will definitely come back to fly around in paris. (or when i got neck pain)","Oct 1, 2017 at 2:43 AM",4, 4,

Can honestly say this is the first game I've played where you are in the shoes...talons? of a bird and its done perfectly. The free roam alone was worth the $27 I paid, there is plenty of easter eggs to hunt for as well as you can replay the missions so I can see a good bit of replayability here, if not to hunt the easter eggs or replay the missions, then to just hop in and fly around is enough fun in itself. The story is interesting but nothing to get excited over. Only thing that kinda bothered me was the tilting your head to make sharp turns, definently doesn't leave the neck feeling great. The multiplayer isn't there but honestly I could care less as I typically play all VR titles alone.

Whenever you turn or fly close to any object or the ground the game imposes an awful vignetting effect which halves your FOV making it look like you're playing on a VR headset from 20 years ago. Considering that you spend almost the entire game turning or flying close to stuff this means that your FOV is almost never what it should be, and even on the rare occasions when the vignetting isn't active there's also an ugly overlay of black feathers around the top of your vision, permanently obscuring your view.

Worse still, these idiotic ""features"" can't be disabled in-game so what should be an exhilarating experience of flying at breakneck speed through the ruins of Paris instead feels like you're barely moving (and looking at the world through the ends of a couple of toilet roll tubes whilst doing so).

The irony is that the sort of people these forced comfort modes are pandering to (those who've been convinced that artificial VR locomotion = instant sickness) aren't going to buy a game where you fly about as an eagle in VR anyway (no matter how much the experience is watered down). Meanwhile, the majority of actual potential customers aren't going to want to play a game which literally halves the capabilities of their expensive VR headset.  As a result the multiplayer component of this game is DOA, leaving only a short campaign consisting of a few time trials where you fly through hoops or tunnels or kill a few AI vultures before a timer runs out.

When I first heard about Ubisoft's VR games I intended to buy them all the moment they became available, but after the teeth grinding frustration of having my headset compulsorily crippled by the Eagle Flight devs I won't be touching any of the rest with a 10 ft pole, at least until I've heard confirmation that any ""comfort"" modes are optional.","Nov 14, 2016 at 11:59 AM",1, 21,

Playing story mode, I thought it might be so exciting experience to multiplay because single-play mode was great fun. But as to multiplay, unfortunately, I could seldom play a full match, that is, 3 on 3 match. It is because there seems to be so few online players there.  I know the multiplay mode is based on cross-platform, but in many cases, I'm all alone in the waiting room for several minutes.
 Although it might be because of regional matter(I'm in Japan), the experience about multiplay is not worth its price.

They'll tell you everyone will be fine with it after owning VR for a while. I've had my rift for months now and I still get sick with artificial locomotion on just about every game not in a cockpit or with very smooth, slow movement.

Except for Eagle Flight

I can play this game for a long time and not get any sickness. In fact, the only sickness I get is after long play periods, after taking my rift off my body doesn't like head tilts for a bit :)

They've heard you crybabies on reddit, here in reviews, and on twitter. They'll add an option to take the blinders off for you basement dwellers.

Anyway, the game itself is a lot of fun, and will have you pulling high speed moves through the back alleys of Paris in no time. The subway system challenges are intense and awesome. You'll be attempting them again and again to get the best times possible. The combat is visceral, and the online play will have you jittery with adrenaline. 4/5 only as it's a little light on content for the price point.

2022-05-28 15:03:42.224779,DoctorBambi,"Solid Foundation, But I Want More!","I'll start by saying Eagle Flight has been one of the best VR games I've played to date. It manages to be freeing and relaxing while offering a nice level of challenge in the later levels of single player, but the game is not without problems. Much like the original Assassin's Creed, Eagle Flight sets an incredible foundation with fairly lack lust content sprinkled on top. What this also means is, Eagle Flight 2 could be absolutely amazing if given proper attention and funding. The single player campaign follows an eagle from birth up through adulthood, but comes off more as a shoehorned way of teaching you the game's controls than an actual story. I think there was a real missed opportunity to incorporate some survival mechanics here. Things like finding your own perch, defending your nest, and hunting for food could have added some more personal stake in your eagle's life. Instead you fly around doing some different challenges around a beautiful overgrown Paris. It's not terrible and there's some fun to be had, especially if you like to explore.


The multiplayer is where Eagle Flight really shines and also falls short. There is only one mode currently available, 3v3 capture the flag, but a surprising amount of depth awaits you under the simplistic nature of the controls. When you get beaten, there's a deep sense that your own skill is to blame and keeps you coming back to try new approaches. Sadly, with no sense of progression from match to match outside of your own personal skill, no statistic tracking or achievements to be unlocked, essentially only one map and one game mode, the multiplayer lobbies have been left barren. All in all, what you have is a great start, but it needs more nurturing. A more realized and fleshed out single player and multiplayer could lead to an absolute hit in a sequel.
