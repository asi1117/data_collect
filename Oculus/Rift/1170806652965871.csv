2022-05-28 17:48:21.415078,Prangle,great game for the price,when i saw that this game was for only 13 dollars i didn't have high expectations but the game was great. it was short since there were only 3 bosses but 3 really fun bosses are in my opinion worth the price. also the graphics and animations are great.,"Jun 29, 2019 at 11:56 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 17:48:21.430038,Nonebetter,Super fun! can be scary,"I scared the pants off my friends when I had them play this game, totally worth it just for that.
The game is simple but really fun, the graphics are great too.

Play how you want, its got old weapons and new ones, guns, swords, bows, whatever you like, try not to get sqished or eaten ;)","Mar 26, 2019 at 7:49 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 17:48:21.444998,Iron2Diamond,Exciting But Short,This game is good with the dodging and attacks but is very short.You have 2 weapons origionally and you gain more weapons as you complete the levels.There are only 3 levels and they are almost the same excapt for the bosses.Since it is so short it is easy to learn attacks and stratigise to beat the levels easier.,"Mar 17, 2019 at 2:46 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 17:48:21.459958,FastLawyer,Buy on deep sale (< $5 USD),"This can be a fun game if you accept it for what it is. It's a silly, dumb arcade hack'n'slash / shoot / explode game where the focus is just on the feeling of fighting epic monsters and getting a good workout. Yes, you will start sweating if you play this game for 20-30 minutes. You will dodge left, right, and crouch down while hacking or shooting or throwing nades at giant enemies. That's where the game really shines. It's not Dark Souls. So if you expect anything other than silly arcade fun, you will be disappointed. There's very limited content. You can finish the game in 30-40 minutes. Buy on deep sale only.

2022-05-28 17:48:21.473920,grekb,Whats up with the personal data gatherin,"Alright that personal data gathering at the start made me sick. Not only you gather oculus data, but you proceed to gather data from every inch of my life, my computer, brower data, what sites i visit, what i click, what i buy, and thats not enough you move on to my phone personal data, emails, and if my TV is smart you gather what shows i watch. Oh, and then you spread it on the whole internet to know about it. Why? Because you made an fps game???? ARE YOU FOR REAL??? Also there is no decline button about your policy, only accept. I had to reset to oculus home to exit. And obviously i didnt play your game and i REQUEST A REFUND!","Dec 7, 2017 at 7:17 PM",1, 127,
2022-05-28 17:48:24.581608,nrosko,rubbish game,"zero skill involved, rubbish animations & looks a mess.","Mar 1, 2018 at 6:20 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 17:48:24.597566,AccidentallyMental,Wow.,"I've been searching for a swordfighting game that has lots of dodging and moving involved but I never expected this! It's very repetitive though, but when you overlook that it's very fun and it made me shudder at the final bosses of each stage. I recommend getting this game when it's on sale, because it's not quite worth 12 bucks. I got it on the anniversary sale and it's so worth it!","Dec 7, 2017 at 1:20 PM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 17:48:24.612526,simone66,Awesome,"this game exceed my aspectative, i must say it is a must have on every oculus rift possessor, expecially for those who love sword and shield play, you can also shot with guns ok, but this game make oculus concept shine,  the only reason i don't give to it 5 stars is because this is more like a demo, it is very short, but contents is something simply fantastic","Dec 7, 2017 at 8:38 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 17:48:24.626488,Markwittz,"Fun, but very little content.","I beat this game in 20 minutes. It is an awesome concept that makes a great game, but if you are like me and dont usually feel the need to replay games there just isnt enough. If the game updates with more content i'll gladly play, but until then it will sit in my library.","Dec 7, 2017 at 11:35 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 17:48:24.641448,HectoriousDaGr8,Fun game and scary!,"I got this game on sale for less than $5 and it shocked me! Yes it's a bit repetitive with the combat, but facing down huge enemies isn't an easy feat...it can be out right scary! Still, this was a very fun but short experience.","Dec 7, 2017 at 10:56 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 17:48:27.728193,jim1709,STAY AWAY,"For anyone that might be new to VR and not understand what this game is let me  explain it real quick. 1 year ago I bought this game and gave it 4 stars cause I thought to myself ""with some polishing and a lot of new content this game will be amazing"". Nope. When you load the game for the first time it gathers personal info and spreads it all over the internet without your permission. Actually you paid money for that. Pretty neat right? So before you go off buying this for some reason know that the devs have made this game for the money, then abandoned it and let it slowly die. Dont let the stars trick you. If you simply dont care for all the above and just want a game with giants also know that the controls are bad and the game itself can be finished in about 30 mins maybe less - 0 replayability. Enjoy!","Jul 30, 2018 at 5:52 AM",1, 8,
2022-05-28 17:48:27.744150,Xelimos,I think i know the fear of SAO players!,"This game, upon completing the tutorial and fighting the first boss, i thought the game would be slow, boring, and not something for me, BOY WAS I WRONG! I felt actual FEAR when i fought the stage 2 boss. (Not giving away any spoilers.) The SIZE of the bosses are something i felt was the reason the people in SAO were terrified. My GOD!!!! This game is freakin amazing, i hope to see other titans soon! To the developer of this game, this is a very unique type of fear you can instill in players. I believe you can do so much more with this game, SO MUCH MORE. You and your team have a brilliant idea, please make something much much more with this.

If i have one teeny tiny complaint. The tracking with pulling your weapons out can get really bad at times, IE me reaching for the guns on my hips or swords on my back and pulling out nothing at all. That really needs tweaking. But thats it!","Jun 19, 2017 at 7:01 AM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 17:48:27.759110,Wonzel,Nice graphics but bad physic.,"Well, the game itself is not really good. If you compare it with Valcyre VR (its for free) then this game here should be for free. The physic is a joke. Just move the sword to the enemy and move it soft and a bit left and right and its already a strong hit. Maybe after some Updates it will become a better game but up to now I enjoy the free Valcyre VR much, much more! Important: It brings no SFX Sound on my Soundblaster Card, only with onboard sound. Dont know why! :-(","Jun 3, 2017 at 5:24 AM",3, 9,
2022-05-28 17:48:27.774070,lbonasio,Fantastic graphics and amazing gameplay!,"This game is a WORK OUT! WOW! after paying it for 30 minutes you will be as sweaty as if you were on the gym for 30 min!

Graphics and gameplay will get you hooked within 2 minutes. Immersion is perfect! Sucha fun game to play!

Yes, it's pretty short. But I feel it is a gret value fot the price I paid.

DEVELOPERS: PLEASE add more content!!!","Jun 17, 2017 at 10:21 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 17:48:27.789030,frdjck,Worth it!,"It's a very fun game. The monsters are big and imposing. The dual use of gun and sword is really fun. You have to dodge attack,so you have to move a lot. Recommended.","Jun 3, 2017 at 8:41 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 17:48:30.876771,neocaleric,Great ideas and execution.,It works really well. Only thing is it makes you wish it was longer. Hope enough people buy it so we can get more levels or a sequel with much more content. Still for the small price they charge it's a good buy to have fun a few hours.,"Jun 11, 2017 at 2:04 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 17:48:30.893726,eternity575,MEH...,"Nothing more. graphics are fine, but gets repetitive. not a AAA class game, but worth the money for some fun.","Jun 12, 2017 at 11:24 AM",4, 3,
