2022-05-28 16:53:26.707724,FastLawyer,Ends with a whimper,"I was looking forward to The Villa. I had enjoyed the first part of the trilogy (The Hospital) and was looking forward to each installment. However, although this has better graphics than the first, the controls are worse than the first game. This experience also took away the key finding & finding the correct path gameplay elements of the second. However, although I do appreciate linear gameplay, the problem here is that there is almost no story. It just shows some quick past events from Allison's childhood while you walk around the Villa (that leave nothing to the imagination). There are some jumpscares mixed in. About 12 minutes in and you get your last jumpscare. Then it's game over.

2022-05-28 16:53:26.732656,Metalsech,Oculus Touch Not Working Right,"This game would be great if it wasn't for the fact that the stick on my right Touch controller keeps deactivating whenever I press any other button. The only way to re-activate it is to go to  the Oculus menu and then go back in. Has anyone else experienced this, and if not what's going on with my controller, as it works fine in other games...","Oct 26, 2018 at 7:58 AM",1, 6,

Some games drag on, this one wraps up well. Graphics need work... on the models, but still a greate game.","Jun 14, 2018 at 10:36 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 16:53:26.762576,nightcat.mau,Short But Spooky,"I'm giving it four stars instead of three because of the ladder mechanic and flashbacks. The game has some good elements like the previous title, and a lot of horror game nods. That said, the graphics can get a wee bit murky at times, but I'll forgive that for a 1.0 build. I like that there were no puzzle elements (I'm lazy) but didn't like having to turn my wrist oddly to open and close doors, it just felt strained.  

Twenty minutes at a brisk pace, would be longer if you meander. I think it could honestly work as an on the rails seated attraction, it felt a bit like walking through a funhouse, and the graphics need some polish, but overall fun. And short isn't bad if it spares us a padded game. 
I did a let's play so you can get an idea. Keep in mind I did not adjust the brightness for YouTube. https://youtu.be/MBPFBH4ak3s

EDIT: Did a second run through with the graphics set at high, and much nicer experience, though it was really hard to get the setting to switch to high and stay there.","Mar 23, 2018 at 2:36 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 16:53:26.777536,DisplayVRC,NR 3 is great again!,"Very good horror game ,
To bad its a very very short game.
Finished it in about 15-20min.
But still if you like horror games and you like the other 2 games before then this one is a must have.
For me personal its the best one from the trilogy.

Recommended but.... very short game.","Mar 25, 2018 at 4:55 AM",5, 5,
