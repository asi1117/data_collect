2022-05-28 20:00:28.052361,He-man_Skeletor,is it available on oculus or not?,"omg this is so confusing the store sends you to quill.art, and that site sends you to the store, and at  the end I dont know how to use it or even how to install it. this so frustrating because it looks really amazing on the vr player so I want to create my own content,",Jan 8 at 10:02 PM,1, 30,

2022-05-28 20:00:28.083278,TK-361,Unusable because of traces bug,"I was excited to try this version of Quill, but unfortunately traces appear across the display whenever you or something else moves. Sounds like this is a bug related to AMD GPUs.",Dec 31 at 11:40 PM,2, 8,
2022-05-28 20:00:31.222488,kocg957,BUG/ ERROR: No text boxes and traces.,"There are no words in the whole app, all buttons appear blank and you can't read what each button does. This is a serious problem, you can't navigate the interface if you don't know what each button does. 

This added to the fact that there is a trail (traces) of everything you see on screen as you move around, makes it unplayable.

I have an AMD RX580 gpu and AMD Ryzen 7 2700x and 16 gb of RAM, I don't know if it has anything to do with it.

Please fix this, because this is an amazing drawing and animation app, the art people make are amazing and I would like to keep enjoying talented people.",Nov 28 at 11:12 PM,1, 16,
2022-05-28 20:00:31.241438,iouart,amazing,I've been working in the games industry as a 3D character artist for 7 years and used most of the art creation tools out there. While they all have pros and cons Quill has been the most fun and enjoyable. It lets me get into flow faster than any other tool apart from pen and paper. I haven't been this excited about a program since zbrush. For being so light weight its surprisingly vast and powerful. It opens up a lot of possibilities,Sep 17 at 5:48 AM,5, 26,
2022-05-28 20:00:31.257395,Gillgamesh,limitless potential,"Quill breathed new life into my artistic journey. It brought together all my different interests; 2d, 3d, animation, storytelling, and even cinematography and made me grow as an artist in all of these areas simultaneously. We even have an active fun and supportive discord group (Virtual Animation) where we share our work, learn and improve together. I recommend this to every artist out there!",Sep 17 at 4:40 AM,5, 19,
2022-05-28 20:00:31.272866,nickladd,My favourite art software,Quill is my favourite art tool both in and out of VR. It combines everything I love about 2D with everything I love about 3D and allows me to quickly create and animate whatever I can dream up!,Sep 17 at 3:39 AM,5, 25,
2022-05-28 20:00:31.287821,Serwilij,bug with traces,"when using Quest 2 by oculus link, when moving your head, traces of any objects remain, which prevents you from using the application comfortably",Nov 3 at 4:39 PM,3, 4,
2022-05-28 20:00:34.372633,Volterra,This is the future of 3D animation,"If you love to create 3D or 2D animation, just give a try! and say goodbye to clicks and commands on the keyboard and mouse. This brings the opportunity of bringing your art to live in a 3D enviroment with your own hands.",Sep 17 at 5:09 PM,5, 5,

2022-05-28 20:00:34.418019,Henri,Excellent for animation creation,"First you ""buy"" it from here and then it appears into your Oculus app on Windows. From there you can install it too.
I am not good artist but this is very interesting tool to create - not only virtual worlds but make also objects to move.",Jan 20 at 9:18 PM,4, 0,
