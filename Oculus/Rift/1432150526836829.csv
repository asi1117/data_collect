2022-05-28 19:30:01.190389,Nightlore,VR Home,Failing to load up backgrounds within this app.  Dev you really need to test such programs before putting it up for download.   Please fix all your issues.,"Jun 12, 2020 at 3:14 PM",1, 11,

2022-05-28 19:30:01.218314,Satconcook,Long forgotten,"This looks like a concept that has recieved 0 attention since it's release. The Touch controllers do work as a gamepad, only if the application is in focus on the computer. Other than that, it looks like you can't get the content anyways.","Jan 3, 2020 at 11:57 AM",1, 3,

2022-05-28 19:30:07.512479,Vishnu,Oculus Home Room,"I've totally enjoyed using  Oculus home room. It's the best home room out there to date. I love being able to visit home rooms of my friends and those open to the public. I like the ability to express myself in my own home room.  And when visiting other home rooms, you get a sense of who and what the owner of the room  is like based on how they decorated their room. It makes for a better human to human connection.","Feb 6, 2019 at 4:54 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:30:07.528436,V_Anand,No Touch Controls,On here it says - touch controllers supported (as a gamepad) - but in Game it says i must use oculus remote to navigate and push any button. Therefore i cannot open any of the rooms and cannot use the app...pretty pathetic,"Feb 23, 2019 at 9:10 AM",1, 2,

2022-05-28 19:30:07.557359,Zencala1,Horrible,On oculus rift the forward and backward movement are incorrenct. I press forward and it goes backwards with no way to change controls. Graphics are nice but need to fix the controls.,"Apr 16, 2018 at 10:46 AM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 19:30:07.572319,wei.lee.3,"Good rendering, but...","The rendering is high quality, but the camera movement makes me very dizzy. It is a good concept to add the movement in the VR, but not in practice.  The motion sickness really turn me off.","Jan 14, 2018 at 10:50 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:30:10.660060,Abhinashs,I Love the app,"Specially Different homes and area to look around, if real estate guys can provide this kind of  experience, it can save a lots of hassle which i can relate to. Would like to see more items added in the app.","Apr 20, 2017 at 3:02 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:30:10.675020,neuro27,Proof-of-Concept,"This is a neat demo of 5 scenes. The first scene is a hyper-realistic European home; it takes forever to download (and you have to remain in the rift the whole time), but it's worth it. There are 2 more scenes of homes, one scene of a hotel room, and one scene of a guided tour through a supermarket. This app looks like it can accomodate more scenes in the future with icons in place for missing featues like favoriting, sharing, and view count.","Mar 19, 2017 at 7:24 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 19:30:10.689981,subramaniyanvg,Nice idea,"App is really good especially with 3 homes (Neighbourhood,European,Hotel room) that provides high quality detail and I like the feature of color changing the environment and allows you to move,rotate and scale the object that are in the enviroment. Unlike other Vr apps where they allow you to see the environment from different spots but wont allow you to do walkthrough but intrestingly in this app you can walk around the environemt thats really cool.
Supermarket experience is good where they take the tour around the market but the quality of supermarket is not that much detailed enough and in future if they keep home instead of supermarket it would be nice since app is for home users. Waiting for more experiences in future realease and also expecting to view experiences in VR for realworld homes . Overlall the app is good and serves the purpose of what it says","Mar 23, 2017 at 2:05 PM",3, 3,
