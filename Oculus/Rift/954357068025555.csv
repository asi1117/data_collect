2022-05-28 18:24:45.423637,HaHaYesIDid,Pretty fun but dosent last too long,"Ok, for ten bucks its not bad. But content is lacking and there is no variety. It is one level and one mode. The graphics are good, everything is smooth as far as gamplay and the idea is great but if it can have more depth to it, this could be a hit. Multiplayer with other people would be a great idea. 4 stars because it has a good concept and is put together well. Since it is early access i hope more is to come.","Jan 10, 2017 at 1:10 AM",4, 0,"We have updated the game with several more levels, a trophy system and some new power ups, give it another look! Thanks for the review!"
