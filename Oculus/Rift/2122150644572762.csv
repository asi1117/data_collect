2022-05-28 20:59:26.994774,MachSchnell,Really cool experience,The museum itself was built in a very interesting way with a lot of creative exhibits. My favorite was the Spirit/ghostly room and the comic book style worlds that these artists spent a lot of time and care on. Hope this gains some traction in the VR community.,Feb 7 at 9:29 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:59:27.008737,leoI3ug,Great experience!!!,"I was looking for a a nice concept, well executed design for VR art. On the negative side the Teleport / walking system is too short/slow and not confortable,""dizzy"".",Jan 22 at 3:49 AM,4, 0,

2022-05-28 20:59:27.037660,DarkMofo,Its a great concept and well executed.,"It is really well done and I would like to spend some more time in the app. However most of the new exhibits have a sign stating does not work with Occulus, why even sell the app on the Occulus store then?",Jul 14 at 6:03 AM,3, 2,
2022-05-28 20:59:27.052620,Molokan,Phenomenal app,"Best of VR,  hope the creators keep adding to it. The multiplypayer works great, that I wish many other VR apps had, hint hint AirCar, Together EP. 

A  truly unique app that's fun to hang out in with friends and the occasional what's that stranger.","Feb 15, 2021 at 10:52 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:59:30.170281,JohannesMeyerVR1,"I love this place,","It shows a broad variety of art and VR specific experiences while using space, proportions and movement in creative ways.  It does not only display new immersive and interactive forms of art but also host interesting events. I also got great support from the developer when I had a technical problem with the app. We could solve it quickly.
I will return here very often.","Aug 15, 2020 at 8:12 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:59:30.186238,macpatrick,Wow,"These days when museums are closed, this is the next best thing - actually better.  The artists behind these works of art are incredible.  The museum is expansive.  Really hope they have plans to add works in the future.  Cool VR interaction and the virtual runway show is out of this world - literally.  I'm now a big fan of VR artist Danny Bittman - check out his work.","Aug 3, 2020 at 12:15 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:59:30.200201,krisvdvijver,One of the best museums/galleries in VR!,Visiting this museum is a fantastic experience.  I hope development is still ongoing and that more works will be added in the near future.,"Sep 16, 2020 at 7:45 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:59:30.215161,firesion,Not a Game,If you look at this as a game you will probably not be happy.  If you look at it as going to an Art museum its AWSOME!  The presentation and the instalations are fantastic and the design is very well done.  I would recomend this to anyone who likes to visit museums.,"May 5, 2020 at 1:32 AM",5, 19,
2022-05-28 20:59:30.229124,Han69,After some Problems I must say WOW,"The Programmer will help me with the Problem that I can´t go in the Museum.

Now all works. Very nice. I hope there will come more and more Objects with the time. Wow I must say to some Things, and i will in VR with one of the first, that are very beautiful. In contrast, LSD is crap. That is an enrichment. Keep it up and THX for your work.","Jun 5, 2020 at 2:44 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:59:33.319858,SPAC3R,Love this,really loved this. I've been making and looking at VR art for a bit and this is the best way I've seen it displayed. Such a nice space to explore with some really impressive work. Perfect for art junkies.,"May 30, 2020 at 7:29 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:59:33.333820,rheo,EPIC,"A paradigm shift for museum culture and an wonderful, inexhaustible experience. We need more VR of this nature.","Jun 11, 2020 at 1:16 AM",5, 2,
