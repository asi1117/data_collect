2022-05-28 17:29:15.301005,tylller101,misleading?,"Rated 5 star so that it will most likely be seen im a little concerned i curious as to why they left so much of the tamir rice story out (the boy shot in the video in this documentory) the reason the police were called was from a concerned bystander that states that there was a man pointing a pistol at random people in the park. the caller also said repeatedly that the gun is probably fake and that the person was probably a juvinile however the 911 disbatcher never relayed this information to the responding police officers the ""gun"" was later found to be a black airsoft pistol nearly indestinguishable to a model 1911 the problem with it however is that the orange barrel tip indicating that it was a toy was missing pictures can be found online for those wanting to do there own research just wanted to provide an unbiased list of events not mentioned in the documentory hope you find this usefull and remember DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH not because there are wrong informatin being portraid because there is little to none here but because it should be a habit so you know your getting the full story and not spreading or believing only half truths","Jun 27, 2020 at 1:12 AM",5, 57,
2022-05-28 17:29:15.316962,OS2Heller,Not inaccurate but not the whole truth.,"Got this just to see if there were political messages. Not really but kind of. All the stories seem to be factual and quite sad. However, America is being blamed inaccurately as the reason for opressino. This ignores the fact that America, Republicans specifically have fought against slavery and the opression of all minorities throughout history. There is no better country on the planet where this is concerned. 
I saw a poster in descretely placed location while in VR while stories of opression were being told. The poster said  ""Make America G###E Again"". There was something ontop of the ""Great"" where you couldn't really see it. It really was not ment as a complementary thing. Overall, there are some valid historical points here but the full story of what needs to be told is conveniantly disreguarded. Because of this, it turns thin into a mild race bating propaganda piece which I was hoping it would not be. It's a discrase! If you want history, this is not for you. If you want to keep playing the victom and keep your hate alive, Hit play.","Sep 25, 2020 at 10:40 AM",1, 41,

2022-05-28 17:29:24.848469,CinemaLeo,Phenominally moving short VR doc,"This short film truly displays the power of VR for cinema. Seamlessly merging documentary with magical-realist transitions into the past, often within the very same frame. 

The style and detail, from syncing in the same or different crowds in the restaurant to the effortless leaps between 2d and 3d film, is really staggering, and the fact it was produced in VR only drives the point home further. These are real people and their lives have been profoundly effected, they sit here with you telling you their stories and experiences-this is a feeling that, up to now, is exclusive to VR cinema.

It just pains me to read through many (not all) of the negative reviews here to see the exact forms of racism and bigotry the film is advocating against.

No, the space depicted is not a racist one. There are diners from many different ethnicities, and it is simply exploring the hardships endured by these real people.

Watch it, feel it, and experience it for yourself. But this is truly a heigh point for VR cinema.","Dec 21, 2019 at 4:48 AM",5, 47,

I don’t need to be reminded of it all the time and don’t want my kids to keep seeing these kinds of things and feel bad about themselves. Production value was just ok, nothing great, really no reason to be VR and I’m a little surprised/offended that Oculus even has this in the store. It’s things like this, especially the Tamir Rice part at the end, that increases tension and divisions between blacks and whites, and it’s totally unnecessary.

Usually I'm looking all over the place in VR to see what defects I can see, but having a room full of people looking at a speaker makes that tougher when you feel like you are sitting with them.  

The other thing that really impressed me were the small details like the reflections in the mirror either changing between time periods or removing people.  I almost didn't even notice that, but it really ephasized what was going on when I did.

I didn't know about the green book or the Tahir Rice shooting until watching this, which made it more engrossing as a white guy who isn't as familiar with these issues.  I saw another review point out the kid that was shot had an airsoft gun which I do feel changes that narative a bit, but I think the fear and separation that the green book was about is still felt in that story.  I still highly recommend watching it.","Aug 24, 2019 at 7:24 AM",5, 22,

2022-05-28 17:29:34.249325,liquidhot,Quality videography. Lacks story focus,"This video looked good for a 360 video in VR. The environments were very cool and mood was great. Good compostion throughout. The menu setup is a little cludgy, but for what amounts to basically a 360 video, it's fine.

At the beginning they talk about the green book. That part of the story is fascinating and well laid out. Then they come to the story about Tamir Rice who was shot by the police, but if you don't know the story they leave out the fact that Tahir was holding an airsoft gun without the orange safety tip and had been pulling it out of his waistband and pointing it around prior to police arrival. It's still a shame what happened and the police did NOT handle the situation properly. Even though it was a story about racism the narrative never relates it back the green book or what it has to do with Traveling While Black which is supposedly the whole point of the documentary. I'm not denying that black people probably do face dangers today while traveling, but this story seemed just thrown in at random and to me totally distracted me from what should have been the real story and instead it was just a more generic, ""these bad incidents happen to black people a lot"". Which, while true, doesn't keep focus on the narrative. 

I wish they had modern stories today about traveling and dangers black people face in this video. Or being a VR story, actually have an experience of what it is like to walk down the street being black in an unfriendly neighborhood. But this Op-Ed chose not to do that and left me feeling as though it was lacking.","Apr 30, 2019 at 1:00 AM",2, 18,

I wish they had kept the documentary about traveling while black instead of trying to live while black. The last story was heart breaking, but I could not understand what it had to do with traveling. It would have more impact to either relate the last story to the traveling theme more clearly or use a different story. That one point aside, it was still an amazing documentary. Also, it is better to view it on the Go.

It perhaps could have been a bit longer, since the scope is pretty large - covering several decades.  
It does rely a lot on visual effects to aid the storytelling - but the most powerful scenes don't rely on these.  In particular, the relatively simple scene in the diner where a mother recounts the death of her son is one of the most moving I have seen in any medium, and VR clearly adds to this.  This comes from the ability through VR to see not just the mother and her emotions but her audience of other diners, who have stopped what they are doing and are clearly deeply moved.","Feb 11, 2019 at 6:38 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 17:29:40.550472,FastLawyer,Best Documentary in VR,"Powerful & riveting documentary by Roger Ross Williams and Felix & Paul Studios. It's about driving while black in America and I know this will probably get some hate from right wingers. However, it's beautifully shot and directed. You start off at what looks like a movie theatre and you're watching old, black & white 2D footage when suddenly you're transported into Ben's Chili Bowl, in Washington D.C.

It's shot 360 and you're put in the middle of the restaurant where you sit and listen to the voices in this community. I've never been to D.C. or this restaurant, but after this experience, I feel like I have been there. I'm not Black, but there is something about being in this chair and having the people talking directly in front of you. You feel like you're really there and you're part of this gathering and the stories are powerful and carry that much more weight. I definitely felt impacted by this experience.

If you look around at the mirrors you can see some differences. You also are put into a bus and there are scenes when you're in the empty restuarant with lighted images surrounding the darkness. The whole experience is a little less than 20 minutes long.","Jan 26, 2019 at 6:03 AM",5, 42,

It's a first person POV in a life-like setting and told by the person who experienced it. The VR part is just to add to the immersion, which is does quite well. There was a lot of information in these life stories that I never knew people had to endure (it was quite shocking).

********SPOILER BEGIN******** One such example was when a child traveling 10 hours via train/bus, had to hold their bathroom breaks until they arrive to their final destination, hold it until they can stop somewhere to search for a spot in the wilderness (like an animal or something less than human) or until they can't hold it any longer and they have an accident right there in the seat of the train/bus (absolutely inhuman). ********SPOILER END********

TLDR:

Bottom line, it’s worth your time, either as a stark reminder of the cruelty of man or as an eye-opener to a reality that people had and continue to endure within a lifetime. I for one do not want this to be any human’s reality for the rest of existence and beyond.","Jan 28, 2019 at 2:43 AM",4, 9,

2022-05-28 17:29:49.984240,XtremeHardcoreGamer,Nice informative mini doc.,"It was well paced and had high production value. The video shots were well thought out and there were nice creative touches sprinkled throughout. Like the diner's reflection. VR has a unique ability to put someone face to face with individuals telling their stories. It's more compelling than a flat screen in many ways.

Why anyone would find this offensive is odd, and telling. One guy said he played games for fun, not to be ""lectured"". What? Did he think he was downloading Call of Duty or something? Bad faith reviews.","Apr 9, 2019 at 1:04 PM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 17:29:53.178695,Trevor4ever,Utmost detestable title screen,"Your title screen depicts the most false narrative in history. A stick figure in the shape of a police officer, holding a pistol, standing at the door with the driver holding his hands up. All this makes me believe is that to be an African American or black male in society today, you must have a strong distaste for law enforcement. Hands up don't shoot; or perhaps, obey the law and don't commit violent felonies. Not one single person holding an oath seeks the day to take the life of another, especially for who they are or what they look like.

If this hadn't hosted such an awful front page image, I would have considered it an appropriate educational viewing. However, you sunk as low as you could get. Rise above the unsophisticated. One black sheep should not and cannot represent a population. Just as you shouldn't judge one man's actions on their race, ethnicity, age or gender.","Feb 6, 2019 at 4:01 PM",1, 66,

Whoever made this should be ashamed of themselves. This could have been so beautiful, but instead all i got from it was ""WHITE MAN WAS RACIST. WHITE MAN STILL RACIST"". 
As a white man all i can say is I LOVE ALL PEOPLE. 99.9999% OF WHITE PEOPLE LOVE ALL PEOPLE. You will always have the racists on all sides, but they are the tiny minority.
