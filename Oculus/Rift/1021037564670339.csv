2022-05-28 14:58:33.226239,BeardyMcGee,My favorite game so far,"Love this game. I was worried I wouldn't enjoy it that much because it was a wave shooter, but the strategy involved makes this excellent. I'm not very big on RPGs and loot collecting, so the gun/upgrade system in this was great. Quick and easy yet still very fun. Me and my friend had a blast taking turns trying to beat the missions together. Highly recommend.","Feb 10, 2020 at 10:06 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 14:58:33.241199,SkScotchegg,Devs_guns only available on planet 1&2?,"I bought this game in sale for £15 a few months ago. I was imeditely very impressed at the gameplay, graphics and mechanics, this game is extreemly fun and awesome to play, I put off buying this game for a very long time, I wanted it for over a year but didn't want to paỳ full price. I wish now I had bought it earlier as it's really great.

Just one thing though, each planet has like 4-5 waves, when I tried the first two planets I could use a whole range of weapons, lots of differant awesome guns, but then when I got to the 3rd, 4th and 5th planet it only let me use a sword, sniper rifle and shield? And I really don't like those weapons, I only want to play with the guns, rifles, shotguns, machine guns, rocket launcher, pistols etc, how can I play planet 3, 4, 5 with those weapons?

If it's not possible then that's dissapointing as that means theres only two planets for me to play on which is not enough levels? I would expect at least 10 levels/planets to play on?","Mar 9, 2019 at 7:33 AM",4, 13,

but in my opinion, there are already oh so many shooters out there with more depth to them than this, i just don't understand why people like this so much? i bought this game before gunheart because i read reviews saying it was better, but gunheart was wayyyy more interesting and engaging. 

this is not a roomscale game. you stand in one spot and shoot various hordes of the exact same monster coming towards you. 
i'm not saying it's bad, just not what i wanted.","Jun 25, 2018 at 5:33 AM",3, 18,

2022-05-28 14:58:36.423687,WindShear25,Excellent game play!,"This is my current favorite game. Lots of ""fun factor"". 

This game requires more strategy than just good aim. You have an awesome assortment of weapons to choose from and there is also a wide variety of different kinds of enemies that come at you. And certain weapons are best against certain enemies. So you have to be smart about which weapon you use throughout the mission, switching constantly as the oncoming enemies change, and to save ammo in that weapon for the next time you'll need it. In a particluar mission, the oncoming waves of enemies are not random. Where and when and what enemies appear during that particular mission is predetermined. So you have to learn and develope the strategy you are going to use to beat that mission. This is what keeps the game from being dull. When you first start a mission you will die shortly by a seamingly impossible onslaught of bad guys. But with each renewed atempt you will learn, for example to first shoot that skeleton with your bow, switch to explosive arrows to destroy the incoming helecopters to your left, then quickly look to your right while switching to your minigun to take out the oncoming flood of spiders and then quickly activating Slow Time, one of your dozen special abilities, just as the flying insects come into view at 12 o'clock, take them out with the minigun and then switch to your rifle to take out the snipers that already spawned in the distance, etc etc etc. Once you think you have the strategy figured out you progress a little further into the mission and realize that you need more ammo in your plasma gun for the enemies that just killed you. So you need to figure out how you are going to change your current action plan so that you conserve plasma ammo for later on, etc etc. Trust me, its addicting and fun!","Feb 28, 2018 at 4:22 AM",5, 18,

You unlock weapon upgrades, and nodes in a skill-tree as you complete levels, which is needed (for me at least) to defeat the levels on the ""Serious"" difficulty.

The forced use of the bow is what degrades my scores from 4 to 3 stars. It's such a gimmicky weapon that shouldn't be necessary to master in a Serious Sam title.","Jan 15, 2018 at 9:47 PM",3, 8,

2022-05-28 14:58:39.604181,mirakhe,A wave shooter - no running,"I was under the impression, perhaps hopefully, that this was a run and gun kind of game. Instead, you stand there, and shoot at waves.
That's disappointing.
However, the upgrade system, and the fluidity with which the game performs is fantastic.
The difficulty level is a little high, but I can see that it is meant to be that way so you build up your arsenal and upgrades so content becomes less hard as you go along, and you start unlocking higher difficulties.
The mechancis are good, the system of gameplay is good.

The depth of interest and playability is low. 
The same thing happens constantly, and in the same order.
Which is nice, because you are able to mitigate the difficulty by becoming familiar with spawns.
But it isn't nice because... no element of surprise after a while.

Overall, I think the price point is too high for the content.","Dec 20, 2017 at 11:30 AM",3, 8,

All the monsters you remember in a fantastic hectic playstyle just like the Serious Sam you remember.  Hordes of enemies coming at you and you have lots of guns with tons of ammo to deal with them.  This playstyle is exactly what Killing Floor as a PC game was and what the Oculus version should have been.  As disappointed as I was with Killing Floor, I'm elated with Serious Sam.

There is one negative.  As far as I can see, there are no ""Player Slots"" so multiple players can save their individual progression.  This is especially important when showing new players or if multple players use the same Oculus.

It just does not fit into Sam and makes the new planets boring and bad for me. Please, dear developer, give me at least a pistol. ;-)

UPDATE June, 2017: Yes, the new Planet is nice again. You can choose also a gun if you dont like the bow. However, its a very hard Planet and the new Boss is really a big peace of a cake but hey, SAM IS BACK!! ;-)

The shooting feels good, alien designs are interesting, loads of enemies to shoot down without any dip in framerate, and the upgrade system is really solid. When you're spending money on ammo and health, it definitely raises the stakes for being efficient and careful.

It lacks some of the cheeky humor of the PC version of the game, and over time it can get a little boring just shooting and lots and lots of things racing toward you. Not a bad game to show off the power of the Touch controllers, however.","Dec 12, 2016 at 1:00 PM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 14:59:11.165765,JoshBeard,Fantastic!,"While not complete, they make it clear what to expect in the final product (5 planets with 4 ""waves/stages"" on each.  Right now, only the first two planets are available, but I can't wait for more!  This is the first game in a LONG time to capture the epic feeling of the final ""Citadel"" level of the original Serious Sam, and it manages to do so by the 4th level!  

The huge difference in difficulty settings may be off-putting for most.  Easy is too easy (to the point it doesn't feel challenging at all and I managed to clear everything without dying).  Normal feels about right other than the final wave of each planet.  The difficulty spike feels like it comes out of nowhere and I ended up dying quite a few times just at the boss.  Anything higher and you probably won't live long!  

Yes, you are stationary for each wave, and yes, instead of feeling like I was losing due to skill, it felt like I was losing due to lack of ammo, but every round felt very satisfying in the end.  This game will have regular play for me.  

New stuff is coming in the VERY near future.  They already announced (On November 24th) that a co-op mode, the third planet, and an unlockable skill-tree to aid progression is currently in testing.","Dec 11, 2016 at 1:38 PM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 14:59:11.211642,Wildlyfe,Practically a 2D game for Oculus,I really wanted to give it one star but it works great as far as not crashing and bugs but the game is basically stand in the same place and shoot.
