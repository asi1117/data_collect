2022-05-28 21:00:46.243812,rocknrolz,I'm hoping this app is sensational,"I would love to experience this app. I have been trying to run this app for exactly a year now, but it is always the same issue... black screen. I can only hear the man's voice in the background. I'm giving it five stars because I'm assuming this app is sensational. Please fix, I can't wait to try it any longer!",Apr 4 at 3:16 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 21:00:46.259769,Thyion,Black screen Problem  - Please update!,"Hi, I really want to ""enjoy"" (as much as you can enjoy this kind of experience) The last goodbye, but I have the same problem as the others: Oculus Quest 1 plus link-cable (also tried another cable) didn't work. Black Screen, just hearing the first voices. Please fix this problem, so we can all experience The last goodbye! (I have a Radeon 5700XT graphics card)",Jan 30 at 11:01 PM,1, 3,
2022-05-28 21:00:46.274729,BadHombre69,"Blank screen, doesn't work",Like many have reported I get the initial setup screen then a blank screen.  I hear audo only.  Playing on a Quest 2 with an RTX 3060.  Tried both with the Link cable as well as with Airlink.  Video drivers up to date as is Quest software,Aug 2 at 12:25 AM,1, 2,
2022-05-28 21:00:46.290686,spitsbergen,Quest 2 + Link Cable / black screen,"Ran into the same problem reported by others. Can launch, see initial floor and controllers, but when the voice starts there is content displayed. I'm a software developer, if you share a contact email, I'm willing to help the development team to debug what the error is. Believe as many people as possible should be able to experience this app.
My graphics card is NVidia RTX 2070, display is Dell Ultra Sharp DisplayPort UP2715k with Display Port 1.2 connection, Windows 10 Pro Version 10.0.19041 Build 19041. Oculus software and ROM are all up-to-date.","Apr 4, 2021 at 2:23 AM",1, 8,"Hi there, thanks for the message, we appreciate the feedback. We had fixed one round of issues with Oculus Quest + link, but the problem has returned and so we are now reviewing again.  Can we ask (if no trouble) what gfx card you are using? This seems to be a variable with link.  Thank you."
2022-05-28 21:00:46.306644,Stav81,Moving,"Video footage is not the best quality - but you're not watching this for the sights. This was a very moving story experience, and helps us to not forget the past. What an amazingly strong man to share his very sad past with us. Thank you for sharing your story","Jan 25, 2021 at 2:40 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 21:00:49.443254,NariousTalonborne,Does not work. (quest 1 and 2),On oculus quest 1 and quest 2 does not work. Very dissapointed because I really want to hear and experience the story! :(,"Feb 26, 2021 at 10:51 PM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 21:00:49.458214,DelapierceD,It seems really wonderful...,"[Update: Problem continues. Will keep checking in]

But I am also having the problem where it shows no image, just a black screen. I lay on the floor to listen to it, which worked for a bit, and still very moving. At some point, the playback stopped, presumably because it required some interaction on my part that I could not perform

I see the amazing reviews from those who could watch it. I hope it works for me soon. Will check periodically. (Using Oculus Quest via Link)","Mar 9, 2021 at 5:55 AM",5, 1,Hi there @DelapierceD We have just updated this experience to fix the Quest + Link issue. Please try viewing again and let us know if any issues. Thank you.

2022-05-28 21:00:49.487137,TechieTypeGuy,Make sure you have some time afterwards.,"Although the experience is only 15 minutes long, you may very much need more than that afterwards.  Very well produced with the only missing element the musty smell of being there personally.
On a side note there are times when being able to pause and ""leave"" for a moment would have been nice, but given that was never an option for the countless victims of regime, I guess staying in despite the claustrophobia is a good thing.","Nov 16, 2020 at 8:09 PM",5, 3,Thanks for your message. We do actually have a 'pause' on button press if you would like to try it.  Thanks.
2022-05-28 21:00:49.502097,P3ndulum,Vr at its best,"This is what I appreciate Vr for, not games but actual experiences and this Short film nails it. 
Excellent quality graphics except for the raw 360 video but the narration is very moving and will stay with you after the credits roll.
Thank you to everyone involved in making this. 
All I can ask is please do more!!","Sep 22, 2020 at 12:57 AM",5, 28,
2022-05-28 21:00:52.584851,aquacraft2,"What a Shame,","It doesn't work for me, just for reference, im using an oculus quest with the link, so i dont know if thats the issue, and everytime I tried using it, it went to the screen with the floor, I was half way through it, at first I though it was an artsy intro that started black with a narration but it never came in.
Im not sure if I should give it a lower review for it not working, but I dont want to be that guy, so if you see this yeah, at the time of writing this review, it just doesnt want to work on quest, which is very weird considering the floor section worked.
Im thinking that maybe i should rate it a number that doesnt have any reviews on it so theres more of a chance for people to see it, odds are if your reading this as a user, you probably already can try it for yourself.","Oct 16, 2020 at 8:16 PM",5, 10,"Hi there @aquacraft2, we have just updated this experience to fix the Quest + Link issue.

2022-05-28 21:00:52.599812,Cheburashka666,A chilling and ominous experience,"It's ironic how there are so many ""video gamey"" experiences that are intended to fright and scare based on fictional premises, while this short experience based on real life of Pinchas Gutter, who survived the holocaust tops all the others in the horror factor of it. 
Yet this is indeed such a wonderful application of VR technology and goes to show that while playing astronauts in outer space has its time and place, it is also important to be grounded in real reality and history because as time passes fewer survivors can give us the first person account of a truly despicable acts that happened to people (ethnic minorities, political, LGBT) , as Mr. Gutter said in the experience ""for no reason"". This is as close as you can get to seeing the walls of them mass-shower rooms, the smallness of the cattle cars in which hundreds of people were crammed on the way to their demise. 
Thank you all who contributed to this important experience.","Sep 29, 2020 at 6:26 PM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 21:00:52.613774,HotWasabiPeas,Moving and emotional VR experience,"The VR experience is a mixture of 3D 360 videos and roomscale locations. The visual quality of the 360 videos is not impressive, but the roomscale portions are very well done. The app very effectively mixes in high-quality 3D videos of Pinchas Gutter in the roomscale portions, so in addition to the feeling of being transported elsewhere in VR, you feel as if Pinchas Gutter is there with you. Small warning: I'm not a big fan of forced motion in VR, and the app does include forced movement in the 360 videos as well as during a couple of sections of the roomscale experience.","Sep 20, 2020 at 10:49 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 21:00:52.628734,eesh88,Won't work on quest 2 with link cable.,I really want to experience this app but it only plays a little bit of audio narration with a black screen. 3 stars because the speach at the start gave me chills.,"Nov 11, 2020 at 9:41 PM",3, 3,"Hi there @eesh88, we have just updated this experience to fix the Quest + Link issue.

2022-05-28 21:00:52.642697,Angelina Starr,Hard to watch,"Very powerful and very emotional.  Goes well beyond the surface of your typical holocaust documentary and into the heart and mind of one man, one survivor, as he takes you on a walking tour of the extermination camp where his family was murdered at Majdanek.  

It's important to see this but I don't think I can go through it again.  It's just too much.","Oct 10, 2020 at 9:56 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 21:00:55.733430,RuneSR2,A moving and important experience,"You'll visit a concentration camp and hear the emotionally moving story of a child who lost everything but his own life. Many of us may not be able to visit the remains of the concentrations camps, but now you can in VR - a great thanks to the devs for making this possible.
The cons would be the very low-res 360 degrees video quality, which probably was done to keep down the app size. The pros are that many rooms/locations are made in normal 3D with textures and look great using my Rift CV1 with super sampling set to 2.0 - and performance is also great using GTX 1080.","Sep 23, 2020 at 2:23 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 21:00:55.748390,euriel,Still crying after this.,This was more impactful for me than any Holocost documentary I've ever seen. Absoloutly soul destroying. Such an important experience that has never made me appreciate the utter sadness before like this has.,"Oct 10, 2020 at 5:55 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 21:00:55.762353,alexicon3000,Volumetric filmmaking classic!,"This is an expertly made and now classic volumetric film. It represents a seamless blend of a host of techniques; merging 360 video, with photogrammetry and a novel combination of stereo cards and geometry created by the great team at MPC. Congratulations to all. 

That feeling of losing the face of someone you've lost is gut wrenching.","Oct 3, 2020 at 7:27 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 21:00:58.918910,Tanzaemon105,Bad Video Quality,"Short experience, but interesting to listen to that old men's memorys.
The roomscale parts are good and impressive.
The video parts though destroy the immersion and with it the experience, because of their extremely bad quality.
A pity.","Jan 26, 2021 at 5:32 PM",3, 0,
