2022-05-28 16:44:25.019545,1MadTheSlaYer,good game but,"this game is one of the best games in vr period, so why not 5 stars. Well I would if the game was not so buggy it can become unplayable. you could probably go on listing ever single bug in the game at the moment and it  would probably take 2 hours or more. This will be a great game once most of the unplayable bugs get fixed. Next there are no new event/game modes after 2 years of playing there has only been 2 uniqe events as I can remember, the dark pj red core, and light or dark event other than that its just a repeat of past events, and game modes also fallow this path with the 2 game modes we have not seen in forever solos, and war. Luckily we are getting war back but no news on solo, we just get team death match reloaded 203. Match making is a bit bad for new players but as the game gets bigger that will most defiantly be fixed . This game is a master piece being ruined by bugs, and we only get a major bug update once a month or 2. Big box is try to fix them i hope, but they need to push out more major bug fix updates instead of only updating the game when a event happens and what I mean by this is updates where we need to update the game not updates that are hidden. ps bigbox add more permanent gun please. UPDATE: i forgot to say the servers are so bad the game renders unplayable",14 days ago,1, 1,
2022-05-28 16:44:25.039492,PickL3-RicK,Ultimate freedom of movement !!,"The guns are great. They all have a different look & feel - literally, down to the reload mechanics, punchy audio, and recoil patterns. The squad based gameplay and tactical map considerations bring a TON of depth & strategy to a super polished game.

But it's the INCREDIBLE freedom of movement - climbing, falling, and FLYING - that pushes POP: ONE over the top. You have to try it. It's what VR was made for.

Please devs !! Make the game F2P (free to play), dropping the price by $10 at a time. A gradual F2P transition will get many more people into the game, growing sales revenue, without ticking off the full paid players. Ultimately, more players = more in-game purchases, more free (social) advertising, and a deeper community base. Valve did a F2P transition with Team Fortress 2. Obviously Fortnite has had incredible success with free to play, and there's no reason that can't be duplicated in VR despite the smaller hardware ecosystem.",Mar 4 at 2:54 AM,5, 14,
2022-05-28 16:44:25.053454,Tip,NOT FOR LEFTYS,"Don't say I didn't warn you. If you play any other shooting games and are left handed, this will be (at least for me) unplayable. I play Contractors, Onward, occ Pavlov, and I am searching for a good BR for quest. This looked perfect. But as a lefty, if you want the gun in the left hand and to ping with your left, the weapon wheel, ping wheel, and quick swap, all stay on the right hand still. OR, you have to flip EVERYTHING, including your movement sticks. Unplayable",Apr 15 at 1:56 PM,1, 2,

2022-05-28 16:44:37.750494,RevinJev,Just read.,"Hello reader. Before you skip, just read the whole thing. I absolutely love this game, dont get me wrong. Climbing around and shooting midair like something right out of an action film, and being able to make plans with teammates on what to do and how to win. I'm gonna give off some pros and some cons here.

Pros:

-Nicely made, good mechanics

-Easy reloading and very smart with the guns

-Being able to fly into windows and easily get good guns off the bat

-Being able to climb around and get the advantages against your enemies, or to just travel

-A storm, to keep things going

This game is all out amazing, but I have some very bad cons everyone should read before buying.

Cons:
Im just gonna write this out instead of naming different things.

The majourity of people who play this game are extremely sweaty tryhards and can snipe you out from 100 meters away. People can shoot you midair with a shotun while flying around you making it physically impossible to fight back. Speaking of ""physically impossible to fight back"", people can headglitch you from long distances. For people that dont know, headglitching is basically hiding your entire body in cover except your hands, making it next to impossible to even see your enemy by the time they have drained your health all the way. I hate to write this, because I know everyone is thinking ""get good"" or ""youre just bad"", but there is no way to even get better when you instantly die to level 60's. Thank you for reading this and goodbye all.",Jul 1 at 12:18 PM,3, 241,
2022-05-28 16:44:37.765454,unripenedskull,OK. In all honesty,"I have mixed feelings about this game. It's relativly hard if you are more recently introduced (because of the players not the gameplay) and gameplay is not really exciting. The guns are simple (but impressive in a way). And there is a BIG crosshair in the middle of the ""screen."" But then there is the fact that this is the most well made VR battle royale ive played so far in my VR experience. In conclusion, if you have other games you want to buy, buy them instead, but if not buy it, it's a game that is not horrible to play for new experiences( And i cant believe its 30 bucks!)",Sep 22 at 6:07 AM,3, 4,

2022-05-28 16:44:40.920017,Rocketman52,"Great Game, Terrible Support","This game is a TON of fun... When it works. Every time the game updates, PVP becomes completely unplayable on the Rift and Rift S (I don't know how it performs on Quests). The game disconnects, crashes, lags, boots you, or otherwise cannot perform. It will not allow you to interact with weapons, items, place cover, or communicate. More often than not, when we eventually spawn into the game the match has already started, and our characters are left within the zone, already being drained of health. Not uncommon that by the time we get into the match, we've died and our teammate(s) are left to their own. The pattern seems to be that the new patch makes the game unplayable, and it's only after a few weeks do things start to stabilize out and gameplay becomes steady enough to be fun.

This game is a TON of fun, by far the most fun I've had with any VR game in a very, very long time... When it works. From my experience, the Bot Battles don't seem to be as glitchy or broken after updates, so we'll stick to those and see if things eventually iron out, but the devs could use some QA before pushing patches.",Aug 13 at 10:31 AM,3, 3,
2022-05-28 16:44:44.008755,STARGÅTER1,Will keep u coming back for more,"This really has such potential to be the best mp on quest2 but it is in need of a few key things. Fix wall glitching, fix matchmaking to be fairer much more than already attempted, I also don’t understand why I die with 3 bullets when I empty a clip in my enemy and they’re still walking around even with full health and shields. On the good side of things Graphics and physics are spot on for the quest2 controls are ok. Aiming is a little bit janky especially with free fire reticles “I don’t see the point” however I’ve had some good play sessions with a good chatty word wide community. Had a total blast and made a ton of in game friends. I recommend this if you love VR shooting games but the competition is very hard for sure due to the matchmaking. My advise is find a couple of people in game to play a few games with and stick together and just learn how to mark enemies in the world. Share resources and communicate tactically as much as possible. It has a great community but it’s not noob friendly. You will die and die and die etc. Fortunately there’s a single and coop bot game to play so you can learn the mechanics of the game and I urge you to just play a couple of hours in that first. It’s much fun especially in coop with other noobs. Fly around drink pop eat bananas and build walls like in fortnight. What’s not to like. There’s various age groups that play including very young kids so try to keep language suitable when matchmaking until you build your friend list to play as a team. I’m really liking pop1 every game is different and there’s a ton of unlock-able skins for characters and weapons. I now have a cowboy hat lol yeeehaaa obviously from this season. That’s another great point. It has season passes which pays for variation for everyone every season. It just keeps everything fresh and brings new quests and customisations and new game modes. We’ve been flying through rings like sonic the hedgehog to get a new character skin. Got mine👍",Jul 22 at 12:28 AM,5, 7,

The reality is there are many Battle Royale games out there, this one was extremely late to the party and in the truest sense - yet another clone. While it has some nice mechanics, it lacks atmosphere. It's the McDonald's of battle royale games, predictable and consistant but ultimately cheap, bland, tasteless. It has been put on too high a pedestal by a customer base whipped into a frezy by facebook funded influencers. If you have never eaten steak - then burgers taste pretty good.",Jul 5 at 1:25 AM,3, 5,

2022-05-28 16:44:47.204209,Flushgogo,"Solid base game, dissapointing support","Theres been a few moments that have made me question if i really want to continue playing pop one. Currently i am not playing the game anymore but do see myself returning if i hear that improvements happen and they start caring.

My reason for this is a buildup of overpromising and underdelivering.
The competetive aspect of the game is barely supported by the devs, balancing of the weapons happens rarely, when a tournament was anounced that they were going to run it ended up being invite only where it was so pre chosen teams not even based of of community tournaments or anything.

Since the game launched i have seen them say ""we do care about competetive"" however throughout all this time i havent seen them actually show that they do, i have seen them add a lot of skins and season pass content, some map changes to keep the casual players active but dissapointing to me in the end.","Jun 2, 2021 at 5:14 AM",2, 5,

2022-05-28 16:44:47.235126,PhillyFab5,Pop one is the best game I ever played,"I got the quest 2 in August of 2020 when they released the pre-orders. I downloaded 11 games in the 1st 2months and of all the games I played, they all left me feeling like it was missing something. I was so excited to get the quest 2 but none if the games out on it met the expectations I anticipated. I saw the previews to Population one and was hesitant to buy it, not because of the price but because I thought I would play it once and never play again like all the other games I bought. But I am so glad I did because I never played a game that had me so hooked and have me looking forward to play again whenever possible. There is only 1 map but sometimes they add different modes or change the map but it honestly doesn't matter. Every game I play gets my adrenaline pumping and I love every aspect of the game. The reaction time from real life to the game is almost instantaneous and there is so many ppl that play the game, you never have to really wait to play a match. Even in the early am hrs theirs ppl from all over the world that play. You also become friends with ppl almost every match you play with someone new. Bigbox hit it out the park with pop one.

I was hesitant to spend so much, but most VR titles come at higher prices so I went for it, and I haven't been dissapointed yet. I haven't played much, but the fifteen or so games I have played have inspired me to write this review, so it must say something!
Population One is fast-paced, thrilling, but also casual: you win some and loose some, and learn and have fun along the way. Being an online game you can expect a few jerks, but the people I've met so far have been awesome. Unlike Fortnite the building mechanic is more of a utility than a skill NEEDED to be mastered and overused (though the shotguns are still overpowered!).
The reloading and gun handling are choppy but fluid and very fun. The locamotives (flying, climbing) make for a more exciting and varied playstyle. Suprise enemies! Take flanks! Throw 'nades and take down squads!

  Each time they update the program it destroys more of the PCVR functionality in this game, including things like microphone.

The pain only kicked in a day or 2 after, so i didnt realize it was the game causing it... My girlfriend hasnt played in a week for the same reason.","Feb 24, 2021 at 9:14 PM",4, 17,

2022-05-28 16:44:56.684852,Liamh1,A really fun and good game.,This game gives me a Fortnite VR kinda vibe but old Fortnite from season 2-4 when players wheren't as sweaty and the game haden't changed too much. I have seen people complayn about sweaty players but I have not seen any one build a five star hotel in under two seconds like in Fortnite. I can't complayn about sweaty players in this game becuz every game has sweats. This game do not have the best controlls. (I wish Big Box VR adds a function to change your controlls and if you know how to change the controlls please tell me) I can't see any big problems in this game but I have some pet peevs like I don't really like the sniper scopes. This game is also a game you could watch on twitch or youtube with no VR experience and undrestand what is going on in this game so this game is a really good game to stream.

I have two important questions for the team:
1) Why is there no menu screen while im in game? If I have to leave mid game for any reason, why do I have to either quit the game entirely or wait til I die/win to get off? Better yet, what if I want to mute someone? What if I want change control styles or movement styles? That is a very frustrating aspect that I have with this game.
2) Why is there no option for contoller remapping? What we have now isn't an issue but I'm not used to it, not when literally ever shooting game has a tried and true method of using a gun. Its ok to use the same shooting mechanics as other games, its not gonna be the death of population one. 

To reiterate, I like this game so far, it plays well, even on quest one and thats great. But please, take the time out of your day to address these problems. I can guarantee you, giving players options and the freedom to play the way they want to will bring more people. Its hard enough to play multiplayer games with almost 0 players because the dev team doesn't care about the users enough to change stuff. I don't want your team to fall into that pit...what you have is great, just please give it the love that it deserves. I know my score is kinda harsh but its done with love because I love VR and I want devs to feel like they are working on the next big thing...because they are.

However it is so much better than Fortnite. It has a huge and beutiful map, the reload macanicks are really good, the game runs ver smoothly weither on Rift or Quest, and... It has the nicest community i have ever experienced in a battle royale game. The game is really adicting as well. The pin actions are great, and the best thing is the climbing. OMG. You can legit climb anywhere on the map. However there are 2 cons that I would like to get fixed. Con 1, there is this huge tower in the middle of the map that is soooo annoying. It is litterally just there, there is nothing on top of it, nothing inside it, its just in the way of everything. I would rate the map of population one a 7/10 just becuase of that stupid tower. Con 2, I wish their were more weapons in the game. When i just started playing this game when it came out. The first thing I did was go to the combat trial and i was like. ""Wow there are so many weapons, {2 shotguns, 3 pistols, 3 ARs, 2 snipers, and 3 SMGs, also a grenade.} Ans i know that sounds like a lot of weapons but it really isint.

Maybe I could even enjoy the team variant, if the game stopped changing audio devices by itself. Even in the audio device selection in settings, the outputs don't match menu positions. Also, my mic doesn't work most of the time, but this might be an Oculus Link issue.

Other than that, collider bugs (bullets stuck in invisible doors or enemies' ghosts) take away from otherwise fun shooting sessions.

These sorts of things could be forgiven if this was a $4.99-$9.99 game. But it isn't.

Edit: Since none of the aforementioned issues were fixed and now I'm stuck with an additional motion-sickness-inducing bug (head is not tracked vertically unless it leaves the general area of calibrated height), I'm forced to update my review.

2022-05-28 16:45:09.320057,Yucci,This is what VR was meant to be,"** REVIEWED ON THE QUEST 2 USING LINK **

This is by far one of, if not the best VR shooter. First of all, I wanna say I’m super picky with VR games. Whenever a game is “pretty good” that usually means it’s a pretty bad game in my eyes. But this game, is so well made. You can clearly tell how much the developers have cared about developing this game. 

Here’s a pros and cons list:

Pros:
- Variety (this game offers variety, you have climbing, building, gliding, reviving, progression systems with skins and very well made weapons which all make up for a fun and non-repetitive game)
- Beautiful graphics on the quest (I’m surprised by how well this game looks on the quest 2. This is PC quality right here.)
- This was made for VR! (Amazing implantation of VR, example fist bumping someone in a game will add them as a friend)
- skin system (like I mentioned earlier. There’s a progression system that rewards you with skins for both your character but also weapons. And they actually look good compared to other games that feature a similar system.)
- Big map on a small quest (there’s a lot to discover here. What will be your favorite landing spot? Honestly, I love just landing in new areas and discovering everything, I’m pretty sure that the devs mentioned that they will update the map  in the future which adds even more to the replayability. 

Cons
- Bad finger / gesture tracking (I’m really nitpicking here, there really isn’t much bad to say about the game but there’s not really a way to point or to make a thumbs up)
- Nothing that tells you about how weapons work (when I first played this, I had no idea how different guns worked which resulted in me dying. For example i picked up a CX4 believing it was a full auto, held in the fire button and it was a single fire weapon and i died lmao. This is a good thing if you like exploration and surprises in games. So this might aswell be a pro lmao

2022-05-28 16:45:15.660099,Ham_VR,Fast paced arcade Battle Royale,"The good: 
- Addictive arcade battle royal gameplay  
- Awesome climbing and flying mechanics and balanced weapons 
- Cross buy on Quest/Rift and cross play with Steam players 

The bad 
- Addictive arcade battle royal gameplay  
- Only one map and only one squad mode currently (3 players)  
- Annoying lobby system of people screaming/shooting  

Having played both the Quest version (on Quest 2) and Rift version (Quest 2 via link) I thought I would give you my thoughts on the Rift, as this version I can be more critical. 

If I could give you a (2D) PC game comparison I would say it's cross between Fortnite & Ring of Elysium. Currently it's 3 player squads, with 6 squads = 18 player Battle Royale. Like Fortnite, you can pick up resources and build shields/plates to protect yourself and climb on. 

The mechanics for climbing and flying are totally nailed, and the game feels very fluid. There are various VR comfort levels, including the essential option to turn them all off and have smooth turning.  

The weapon mechanics are decent and feel balanced. The sniper scope is a bit 'meh' and this doesn't look that great even on PC with the highest graphics settings. Shot damage is displayed like Fortnite, where hit points are displayed when you hit your opponent. 

PC performance on an Intel 9900k and 1080Ti and Quest 2 (link) runs very smooth on highest graphics setting, although for some matches I've had random performance issues for about 30 seconds which tend to settle down and disappear.

Finally, a minor point if you plan to live stream/record this game, there is no easy way to manage the very noisy lobby start area (other than muting every player). FAO: Dev Team, a setting to pick a seperate audio device for voice chat would be very handy for content creators on PC

I would give it 3.8 in its current form for PC. I hope the player base grows and more maps and modes are added. Oh and having played it on Quest 2 (standalone) it plays brilliantly on that too","Oct 25, 2020 at 3:44 AM",4, 19,

You will not win often without team tactics. Communication is very important. The PUG's that I was in, did not communicate, at all. There was no plan. We wandered about trying to find guns, ammo and shields. But, not as a team. We went our own way without regard for the others. Both of my PUG's were like that. Yes, I was guilty of it, as well.

If you have people that you KNOW, to team with, you are at such a big advantage over PUG's. Your communication alone will win that battle. 

But, there are even better teams. They not only communicate well, they move as a well oiled machine. Everyone knows where everyone else is and what they are doing. The military units.

If you are killed your ghost sight is about 10 meters and walking speed and flight times are both Halved, making you useles now and a detriment to your team later when you finally catch up to them, begging for a heal while they're surrounded by a tennis court sized play area consisting of the few teams still left trying to destroy eachother.

I didn't think it was going to be anything special though I thought it was just going to be another VR game that was meh, but the moment I stepped in with my friends I absolutely adored this game we played around 19 matches and it was really late and we kept saying one more game. This game will make you want to hop in another match. Plus this game does one thing that Stand Out battle royale, Pavlov, and Onward could not do it keeps the players coming back for more. Once I got off all I wanted to do was to hop back in and play. This game is the game VR needed.

The maps lack any sort of detail, it all looks like it was built out of lego or designed by a 10 year old.  Imaging Battlefield were about to release the next title and the graphics looked like this, it would be all over,  every gaming mag would be calling for blood.  STOP accepting this crap guys.  Half Life Alex is a prime example of how VR games can look and still run smoothly, and thats the level of experience I want everytime, not this cheap, non emmersive fluff from second rate games developers !!

On to the game play.  Meh!  Whey am I having to use a F***ing rose to select weapons in VR.  There are so many prime example of how invantory can be accessed and swaped and they chose a rose!!!  I want to put my pistol on my hip, my riffle on my back and a grenade on my belt like I do in nearly every other decent VR shooter.  Hell I'll even slip and banana into my pocket, it might just scare the enemy, but hell no to the rose system!!

Guns Suck!! The gunfire looks and sounds hollow!

Is it perfect?  No, some bugs noticable--how do you exit without basically having Oculus close program (or end task)?  Why does it not set my sound to my Rift S, instead sending it through the desktop speakers unless I manually go into my PC's sound settings before I launch the game and do this (don't have to for other games in my Oculus library).

Yeah this game is tops. 

Most social game I’ve played and by far the most fun I have had in Vr in years. So much fun I had to buy it again on quest so friends can play over at my house with me. Yes the graphics are not your Triple AAA Cod graphics most console players are used to but they are still above decent, and it’s not the graphics your buying, it’s the amazing experience of slapping on that headset and forgetting the real world and this game really does this. The community is awesome find my self squading up with the same teammates almost every random game I get into.

Game looks great and performs well, Frame response times were good ( No nausea ) and in game performance was on par. Far distance viewing was easy. 

  Quest 2 standalone review
Game looks great and the fidelity is very close to the pc tethered version. Performance was excellent and equal to my PC experience , also no nausea. Viewing distance was good. Might switch to playing standalone exclusively. 

  Quest 1 + Link review (fidelity set to max)
Game looks good but definitely takes a hit due to the Quest 1's lower resolution, otherwise it performs well and frame response times were good ( No nausea ).

  Quest 1 standalone review  
Game looks rough, but that’s understandable due to the Quest 1’s hardware. The performance isn’t bad but I did experience slight nausea which no other version caused. Still playable and fun.

I know this may be to keep performance balanced, but please, i would love an option to use a regular zoomed scope on the gun.

2022-05-28 16:45:53.582670,ItzChubbs,Best VR Battle Royale right now,"I had my eye on this game for months now and like many other games in 2020, I was cautiously optimistic about it. Many games now show you one thing and you receive something else. Not with this game. From my first drop i was hooked. The pregame lobbies are fun and give you chance to feel out the guns or be silly and hug and high five your teammates and enemies. Dropping into the game it is your squad of 3 versus 15 other people. Your objective is to be the last squad remaining. The game features 11 guns for you to use and for the most part they're all pretty balanced. The game also features a gliding mechanic. You jump and spread your arms like you are using a wingsuit. This is a very unique and fun way to traverse the map. I found myself in a couple of games fighting another team in the sky, it didn't end well for my squad but I had a heck of a time. The game feels super rewarding for getting a win. The game also features a leveling system where you can unlock skins and weapon skins for free with the purchase of the game. So no $15 battlepass purchase necessary. It is limiting but it's a start. One thing I love about Population One is the game has so much room for you to perfect your play and grow as player. What's causing me to not give this game a 5 star review is a couple of things and I am knit picking at this point. I'd like to see an improvement in the friends list compatibility. What I mean by this is if you add a person in Population One you'll then need to re add them into the Oculus friends list. Another issue I have is not that the game is short on content by any means but adding a Solos, Duos and Squads mode I think would really increase the games life. Also increasing the player count to 30 would be a added bonus sometimes when you're getting right into the game and you get your first squad wipe as a team the game ends. My last point would be I would like to see a increase in the customization options for your characters. Adding hats, different gloves, or even pants and shirts make a huge difference and really make your character feel unique. Right now there are just preset character modes you get by leveling up. Again, I am knit picking here and these are just my opinons. Overall this game is tied with Zero caliber as my favourite VR FPS game and have meet so many amazing people with this game.

Then the news came out that this game will have Microtrsnactions. So you need to buy the game just to play and have a deafult avatar. Then thats what kinda took away my support for the game. But at realase Population:ONE will not have any microtransactions. I think if you buy the game you would get a couple of free ""Battle Passes"" like if its 9.99 MSRP for a Battepass then you would get 3 free battlepasses or they might never have any microtransactions at all.","Oct 26, 2020 at 3:47 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:45:56.765158,ChadwickTheCrab,Best Multiplayer Yes,"This game is so fun, the mobilty is amazing. I'm like a shotgun equipped flying squirrel. If I were to ask for anything more, it would be better graphics and sound. I'm assuming it's toned down for cross platform support. The smoke and explosions look like N64 sprites. Rocks are low poly models. Building interiors are barren and empty. The sound could use work too, footsteps are hard to place exactly where they came from.

Thankfully the gameplay more than makes up for the graphical and sound nitpicking. I hope it becomes popular and funds the devs to put more work into it.","Oct 26, 2020 at 1:12 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 16:45:56.798070,Palieus,Glad I took the leap,"So, I was a little reluctant to buy because of the price and inexperience with battle royale type games but because of the high ratings I thought “what the heck!” I’ll do it. So, after the quick introduction to movement and weapons training, I was gunning in no time.

Just some advice for new commers:
(Tip 1.) Stay with your team. This isn’t a solo thing. So, if you think your goanna squat alone in a tower with a sniper rifle- think again! The battle zone shrinks every minute or so. So, it’s fast paced and loads of fun. 

(Tip 2.) Spend 10 minutes or more killing battling bots in training mode until you get use to picking up ammo and navigating the controls. 

(Tip 3.) Your team may not be from your part of the country. So be mindful, respectful and enjoy the open mic chat. 

*Only downside, I wish they had over the shoulder weapons storage instead of a pick and click menu. 

It’s a lot of fun and worth the price.","Oct 29, 2020 at 3:00 AM",5, 1,
