The bad news is that you don't actually have to jog to move fast, just move your hands fast.  In fact, your hands guide the way your avatar moves in the track, so you can definitely game the jogging without much physical effort.  There's powerups along the way and obstacles to avoid.  You're racing against 2 other avatars and also gunning for the top spot in the online leaderboard.  The problem is that there are only 4 tracks at this time and 3 of them are very short (~25-30 seconds long).  On top of that, I found it relatively easy, to get the top spot in each of the tracks.  You do get to to randomly choose the name and look of your avatar (although those choices seemed limited).  I maybe played the game 20 minutes and didn't get much of a sweat and I think there's nothing left for me to do.  So I think $9.99 is a bit too much of an asking price.  I think kids might enjoy this game more, especially if they need some sort of light exercise.","Sep 7, 2017 at 10:10 AM",3, 3,
