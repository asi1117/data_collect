2022-05-28 20:09:49.384802,Ironbug78,Escape from a prison deep under water,"In A Rogue Escape, you have escaped and are on the run for freedom, only problem your deep under water somewhere. 

The only way out is to learn how to pilot a giant mech (Nauticrawl) and navigate your way out. 

You will have 5 different control stations to pull leavers, flick switch and figure out how they work. Just starting up the machine is a challenge, you left to figure it all out on your own.
  
The game uses room scaling to move around the very interactive stations, where you will have to solve how to work the machine, and keep it working when problems pop up.

This game will test your intuition at each station. The stations look and sound great, and is a very immersive experience. This game will have you stumped, but keep drawing you back to solve just one more problem and take a few more steps closer to freedom.

2022-05-28 20:09:49.398765,Golan-Trevize,A very odd machine.,"The same thing is the worse and the better of the game.  I mannaged to start the engine and move the machine a very short distance. Quickly the fuel tank got empty and I wasn´t able to do anything else. I have to play more. By now, i have enjoyed the time i was playing.  The challenge of the game is to understand the working of this odd machine.  
The game works OK, but you need a minimum real space to play it. I haven´t found teletranspotation options in the game.  

I will update this experience later, when i finish the game.","Jun 14, 2021 at 6:35 PM",3, 14,
