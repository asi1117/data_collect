2022-05-28 13:53:46.462560,jroc777,"Lots of fun, but maybe a bit overpriced","A lot of fun, but on par with a lot of demos in terms of amount of content.  I feel like it ought to be priced no higher than $10.  Some of the controls can be a bit glitchy, but overall it's very immersive and achieves it's intent.  A fun experience to share with friends, and mild replay value.  Great if you want to kill 10 minutes.","Apr 3, 2021 at 6:25 PM",4, 143,

2022-05-28 13:53:49.622235,PaisleyDig,Buy it!,Your mind thinks ur in the game and it tricks you. You should definetly try it out if you're looking for a great game to vr. Its scary but fun. Personally the spider part is the best even tho i really hate spider i made my mom play it she is very scared of heights and i made her play the spider section she screamed and took the headset off. And it doesn't matter of you're in a small room. Theres a option where you can use the joystick. Very helpful Worth it you should totally buy it if your on a budget of 15 bucks.,"Apr 5, 2021 at 2:14 AM",5, 32,

You can use the Plank Setup option in the menu which will set the spawn point inside the elevator to minimise the amount of movement you need to do, but you still need to have enough space to safely play without obstructions in the area."

Not worth it if you have a small space","Feb 19, 2021 at 7:01 AM",1, 15,"Hey there, if you're having issues with your play space, try using the Plank Setup option in the menu. It will start you in the elevator, minimising the amount of movement you have to do. It is really important though that you give yourself enough space, at minimum the roomscale play space size that Oculus recommends."
2022-05-28 13:53:49.682075,Shackelfordian,Worth it!,"I didn't expect to react like I did.  I remember watching a youtuber review it and he REALLY didn't want to walk to the edge.  I thought he was being dramatic, but NOPE, he was being genuine.  

I thought I was going to be frolicking to the edge and that walking off would be no problem.  In reality I was shocked at how hard it was to get myself to even raise one foot over the edge, let alone walk off the end.  My palms started sweating big time when I considered it.  

I will say that you only get one first time with the plank, after that the magic fades as your brain finds comfort with the scenario.  This is sure to be a hit at my family holiday gathering this year!

4 Stars for the experience + 1 to offset all the recent negative votes.","Dec 24, 2020 at 5:46 AM",5, 63,

2022-05-28 13:53:59.118731,TheReviewer,An Honest Review,"This game is genuinely scary, but a must have for parties.  This game is a true test to see if you are scared of heights, and a true sensation that you are falling.  The game allows you to control the plank size, so you could use an IRL plank.  


Here are the pros vs cons

Pros: 
1. Everytime I have a friend over for a party, this is the game I start with, it makes the people know how realistic vr could get. Everyone enjoys watching your friend scream as they are high up… Right?  
2. This game is genuinely scary, and great for everyone.  
3. The game offers hidden game modes like SantaClause and a hidden 666 feature.  Along with that they have other game modes like superhero academy which you press the button on the side for.  
4. Very good for newbies.  On the side, you push the elevator button with the controller, and you don’t need to use your triggers at all! (only if you are using the cake or other tools) 
5. Be ready for people who could not walk on the plank!

Cons:

1. The plank setup is very precious and you need to know the exact length, width, and height of the plank.
2. The game may not be scary to users who play VR a lot.  (had a kid walk right off the plank, no issue)
3. Game may glitch sometimes, EXAMPLE when dropping then pressing “Call elevator” at the bottom, teleports me to the top where I am unable to jump off. Easy fix on computer, just pressed reset game. (also can do this in VR by press left control menu button)
4. For some it may cause dizziness
 
As one can tell, there are more pros than cons, and if the cons don’t bug you much then go right ahead and buy it!","Feb 28, 2020 at 2:30 AM",4, 87,

I think I just threw away 15  bucks. Couldn't the developer have made this even remotely intuitive?,"Apr 18, 2020 at 9:29 AM",1, 10,Hey mcat! Richie's Plank Experience is a roomscale experience that encourages you to make the most of your play area. Just pop on your headset and move around with your (real life) feet :)
2022-05-28 13:53:59.165605,RuneSR2,Complete waste of money - beware!,"The app feels very empty - not sure this works even if you're scared of heights! I'm actually scared of heights, but this app did not trigger any fear. $14 is laughable - I'd say this app is worth $1 or should be free. It really has no content. And the devs can't even get the app to correctly reset your position - it was totally IMPOSSIBLE to press the elevator button using default controls, because it was inside a wall in the real world - and I could not reset my position in the game no matter whait I did. My play space is 7 x 10 feet, but it did not work with this game. I could not teleport nor was there any free locomotion - you need to walk in the real world. Seems like the design of pure amateurs - no one in their right mind would produce such garbage today. Did get the game to work using hands controls, but controls were still incredibly poor. Feels like an early app from 2016. 
I'll be refunding this totally overpriced garbage. Performance was nice though - did get like solid 90 fps ss 2.0 using CV1 and GTX 1080 - but this is quite far from Lone Echo graphics, although graphics aren't bad - but unfortunately the rest of the game is a complete waste of time and money.","Mar 15, 2020 at 5:40 AM",1, 10,"Hey Rune, you definitely should be able to reset your position, but you can also use the Plank Setup process in the menu to ensure your start position is always at the front of the elevator.

2022-05-28 13:54:05.408136,M-Capone,Good experience...but I have issues now.,"Ever since getting the Valve Index, the experience is unplayable. Perhaps someone (devs?) can help?? Everything looks great, I set up the plank, but when I step into the elevator and hit a floor...I ""shrink"" down until the floor is eye-level. When the doors open, it looks like the plank is coming out of my face, and I immediately just fall. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game, but it didn't fix it. I'm of course playing through REVIVE, but I haven't has issues with any other games, and I haven't seen anything that says playing this game through REVIVE is an issue.

REVIEW UPDATE 09/27/2019: I've updated my review from 3 stars to 5 stars. The dedication by the Devs for this game shows, and I wish more games would reflect this. It's a simple experience, but they've added enough to keep it interesting, and I still have family members who absolutely WILL NOT walk the plank.

It feels somewhat ""flat"" - dunno why. You look down and think: ""Ok, I'm up here"". You fall down and while you are falling you think: ""Oh, ok, I'm falling"".  It doesn't turn your stomach over and it doesn't give you an involved feeling. You never get that ""PLEASE DON'T FALL DOWN-feeling"" in this one.

Easily the best flying/jetpack/superhero simulator I've experienced... I just want this flying mechanic (which is insanely intuitive), but with different environments to fly through.","Mar 15, 2018 at 6:50 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 13:54:21.263319,Sarrick_,"Okay, but short lived.","When I first saw this game, I thought it was pretty cool so I bought it. But after around 15 minutes of testing everything, it was pretty boring. I know they have ""mini games"" that you can play around with but those get boring after 5 minutes. So I guess you can show this to your friends and watch them freak out, but anyway don't have high expectations to play this game for long.","Feb 13, 2018 at 9:24 AM",2, 25,
