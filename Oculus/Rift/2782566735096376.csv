I feel that it should at least zoom in showing the perspective of how micro this really is. If we are concerned about the microplastics in the water by showing them as full size items, then maybe there should be some piles of poop, maybe some pots and pans for the iron, might as well be some shells and dinosaurs for the other minerals. For something free that might get someone to possibly consider using less plastic bags, bottles or t-shirts? I suppose it is a good thing. Play wise it is a simple mini-game that a kid might enjoy.","Feb 14, 2020 at 11:05 AM",2, 6,
