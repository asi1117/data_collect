2022-05-28 12:01:08.851314,Prophetzzz,meh,"fun game if you like repetitve gameplay, predictable stories, nonstop bugs that completely break immersion. The game took me about 2 hours to complete (including time exploring everything the game would let me) and the funnest part was finding the masks strewn about the linear paths this game has. I started this game with excitement and intrigue and walked away with pretty lukewarm feelings, if you like zombies, the walking dead vr game is much better and more complete. The reason this review might sound a bit harsh is because I played about half of this game years and years ago and absolutely nothing is different now, nothing is fixed and nothing is improved, seems like a dead game that's been given up on.",Jan 18 at 1:16 PM,2, 11,

2022-05-28 12:01:15.170610,EthicalGoat,"Great campaign, not much else.","I had played AZS years ago, before either of the expansions came out. Powered through the campaign with a friend in three hours, thought it was amazing, and that experience was one of the primary reasons I bought an Oculus. There were a few bugs here and there, some clipping, yadda yadda; but I found the game immersive, the mechanics easy to grasp, and the difficulty progression to be appropriate.

Despite having completed the game previously, when I procured my own VR Headset, I bought the game and both its expansions; hoping to revisit the amazing experience I had before. I was sorely disappointed.

Funny thing about EXPANSIONS, you'd expect that the game would be EXPANDED upon, with new things to do and play around with. Unfortunately, they were nothing but new maps with old mechanics, leaving me with a feeling like I had wasted my money since I had basically already done this before.

Horde mode is additionally disappointing. 50 waves later, drowning in extra ammo, and no noticable increase in difficulty, I suicided next to an exploding barrel after my 1000th kill, feeling like I could have carried on perpetually without breaking a sweat.

A fun story, and a great intro to VR, but once you've got the hang of it, it's replayability goes down to zero. Probably gonna uninstall this sucker.",Sep 3 at 2:54 AM,3, 7,

I can't aim down the site of my guns when they are transparent so annoyingly I have to keep switching my guns while getting charged by zombies.

Mechanics are bland and basic, with no ability to really interact much with the environment around you. Pick up a hammer and you just clip through anything you come in contact with. There is no melee so you can only rely on shooting the zombies.  These are updates that should have been implemented into the game as time went on, but alas. The game is also poorly optimized and struggles to perform when there are a lot of zombies piling up.

2022-05-28 12:01:37.294338,NotaHumanResource,Best VR Zombie game out there.,"First off. I was not happy struggling to install this game on my new quest2 after already paying for this game on the rift. It would download to about 50% and fail. I finally realized that I had to re-purchase this game under the new updated release for the quest 2.  That complaint out of the way. I have been using and purchasing VR for over a year. Arizona Sunshine continually gets updates had a huge DLC fanbase and there is always someone to play with. The unfolding story and game play is excellent and the graphics are pretty good on the quest 2.  I played about 8 hours with a friend who just got his quest 2 and we finally finished the main campaign. A lot of fun!  My only complaint is that I wish you could find other weapons such as knives to use on zombies and not just guns. Maybe a health pack to take with you or a backpack to store items. Even better if you could get in one of the vehicles and drive them to run over zombies.  At any rate if you want a AAA vr zombie, story game that has been around and improved upon for several years this is the game you want. Also, the 3 dot glock sites work just the way they do in real life and I like the eject and reload mechanism implemented.","Oct 24, 2020 at 6:00 AM",4, 25,

In fact, I would have given it 5 stars. But upon disconecting from my PC to move to go wireless in a larger room in order to enjoy the fullness of the game, you seem to be asking me to purchase the game again on the very same day, with the exact same Oculus headset. Am I getting this wrong? Am i just not understanding this?Please explain either how I am mistaken, or explain why it is reasonable that I should have to pay double, to simply move from my computer room, to my kitchen. I will be looking forward to your prompt reply. 
Wow! 
I received a prompt reply, I'll give you that. But you should let people know that ""crossbuy"" is even a thing.

They offer the same content, but the Quest version was rebuilt from the ground up and to run standalone and made specifically for Quest. I hope that answers your question."

2022-05-28 12:01:49.913555,moonorama,Old Game But Still Fun to Play,"Story:
You are stuck in a zombie apocalypse somewhere in the middle of the desert. You must get out of the area and deal with zombies in the meantime. Grab pistols, shotguns, smg's, grenades,a sniper, and even a minigun to ward off the incoming waves of zombies. You make your way across many different segments of the map, including a terrifying mineshaft, a prison, and many more locations each stuffed with new weapons, excitement, and more zombies! Plus there are DLC packs that you can purchase which expand upon the story and add a bit more gameplay. 
   GAMEPLAY:
You can choose between multiple different movement modes, including snap turning, teleportation, or smooth locomotion. I have Boneworks and for those of you that don't know, it has the most realistic interaction physics ever created. And that kind of made the interaction in this game underwhelming. In Arizona Sunshine you can't climb ladders, you simply walk up to a ladder and are teleported up or down. The mechanics in this game are kind of old in my opinion, but this game was released in 2016, at the start of VR gaming popularity. 
   SOUNDS:
The gun sounds in this game I think are really well done. They are loud and differ with every weapon. By the way your in-game character talks quite a bit, which is kind of entertaining listening to. Especially during the big f-bomb hurddle. If you play multiplayer you can chat to your partner. Something that is pretty cool is that your voice echos in certain places of the game, like long tunnels. +1 for immersion. 
   All in all I think this game is pretty great. If you want to get more comfortable to VR gaming I think it would be a good idea buying this game. For veteran vr users this may not satisfy everyone, but satisfy me it did!

2022-05-28 12:01:59.388084,Sodaraptor,"Decent zombie shooter, lots of bugs","First off, I got this on the Quest and really enjoyed it. The campaign is what I played most and it's your typical zombie story. Go from point A to point B while finding keys, opening car doors, and shooting zombies. The gunplay is fun and simplistic. That being said, there are a lot of issues with the game.
- Voice acting. Your character sounds good and you can tell the guy was into the role, but after an hour or so he gets PAINFULLY annoying. You'll be rolling your eyes at every little comment he makes on every single thing.
- Glitches galore; I've run into guns getting stuck in mid-air, zombies attacking me through walls, not being able to fire one of my guns, LOSING one or all of my weapons on loading a save, not being able to pick ammo up. There are tons of bugs throughout the game.
- No melee combat. You'll find that you can throw objects at zombies with little to no effect, but if they get too close, you have no option to punch/hit them. Missed opportunity here, as zombies do crowd you frequently and the only way out is to wildly shoot before you die.
- No 2-handed weapons in the campaign. All of the guns you encounter are either pistols, SMGs, or a tiny shotgun pistol. You do get to use a sniper rifle and minigun, but both are tethered to a barrier. The only place I've found rifles are in the endless waves mode. You get a bunch of them there.
- No option for realistic reloading. When you run out of ammo, you just push a button to release the magazine, and put the gun to your chest. An option to allow you to actually push a new one into the gun would've been great.

Other than that, I'd only recommend the base game if you can get it on sale between 20-15 dollars. It's a rather fun, but barebones shooter with a bunch of bugs if you can bare them. I beat the story mode in about 4 hours on hard difficulty.","Jul 13, 2020 at 11:43 PM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 12:02:05.634581,PenkLimon,Worst VR Game EVER,"I'm saying in full confidence that 90% of these reviews on this page are fake. I'm saying this early in the post, please, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. 
Here's why:
Let's begin with an overview, you're a guy that walks through a couple towns shooting zombies and eventually get rescued. Is there a story? No. I don't mean that the story wasn't good. There literally isn't one. The narration of the player was so annoying and obnoxious that eventually my friend and I turned off his voice. 

The bugs: My friend picked up a glowstick, dropped it, game wouldn't let him grab it again which made the map very difficult.
We constantly got stuck in doors and ladders.
Touching sniper rifles and the machine gun will break your hand and make it to where you can't grab your guns anymore. 
It took a straight minute to climb one step because of how glitchy it is.
The lighting in this game must have been done by someone who has never made a game before because it was broken constantly.

This is a 40 dollar game, I can't stress that enough. This is a disgrace. All the models are just ripped from an asset store and slapped in, some of the models are resized to be giant like an SUV we found that was twice our size, for some reason they put some model of a graphics card like everywhere?? What. Then there is NO STORY, I can't stress that enough. Aiming is horrible, you have to almost aim down to get head shots, there's maybe 5 different guns in the game, every time we would load into a new area it wouldn't even have the same guns we had before the load. Oh and the load screens OH MY GOD. Each load screen can take 1-2 minutes. Nothing in this game makes sense, you see a thing that says ""Come to the mine Lucy"" Your character doesn't know anyone named Lucy but he goes into the mine and he's like ""Gotta find a way out"" WHY DID WE GO IN THEN. And how long is this game? We finished in exactly 2 hours, just when you can't refund this garbage. This is the biggest VR scam ever.","Apr 11, 2020 at 3:32 AM",1, 74,

Deal Breakers:

I am constantly losing the ability to grab weapons after pulling a lever/ turning a crank - basically ending the game. Setting a weapons down sometimes results in them being stuck and unusable.

No in game menu - why? my gosh, why? Should people have to exit a game to recalibrate their controls and than start at the last checkpoint...no, they shouldn't.

I would love to finish the game, but I keep on running into crashes or my hands randomly lose the ability to equip my weapons. If I quit the game and reload the last save - the same bug will be present and I am unable to progress.

UPDATE: Now I'm loading games and my weapons will be different than anything I had during the last playthrough - keys for doors can't be picked up and my right hand constantly loses the ability to equip my weapons, but can still pick up useless opjects. Have to restart the game from a new file to resolve and it will do it again eventually.","Apr 14, 2020 at 6:09 AM",1, 2,

A friend also has the Quest now and I can’t even recommend he get it because we won’t be able to play together. 3 headsets and we’d at most be able to play 2 player if we both purchase the game (me for the second time). Beyond disappointed with how this has turned out. This would be an easy 5 star game if I could actually play it with friends.

Add cross-play with single account and I’d even consider paying another $20, but another $40 just for 2 player while one headset collects dust is just absurd.","Jan 6, 2020 at 11:54 PM",3, 54,

So many other developers are cross plat forming their games so you can download on both oculus rift and quest VRs if you have it, example The Climb just came out free for quest to those that already own it on rift.

So why only one star? In my personal opinion the biggest point for buying a game in the oculus store is the ability of using it with the pc and also mobile with the quest - aka crossbuy. If a game (like Arizona Sunshine) doesn't support crossbuy I dont have to buy it here - I should buy it in an independent store to be independent from hardware in the future. I only bought it here because I really HOPE that the devs decide to make it crossbuy in the future but I will DEFINITLY not spend another 40 bucks to get the mobile version for the quest - thats for sure.

Getting it at a very substantial discount puts this game into the ""almost worth what I paid"" category. Had I paid full price, I'd be quite disappointed. If half-stars were possible, my actual rating would be 3.5 stars. That said, it's a fun FPS.

The options/setup could be less ""labor intensive"" - like going directly to a menu of options and getting all of that out of the way before gameplay begins would be my preference. But that's me and I have to remember this game is 3.5 years old...

Having lived in AZ and now living in a ""cold, grey place"", I do enjoy the ""sun and scenery"", even if a bit clunky by today's standards.

This is a complete, lengthy campaign, with good writing and story, great action, well developed systems, and plenty of replay value. It has mutliple free updates, and, a feature lacking in much of VR - MULTIPLAYER. 

When looking for a game, I often ask if someone can recommend something that plays like Arizona Sunshine. It is the reference point for good shooting. So much on VR is experimental - half game, half tech demo. This is fully fledged and well thought out, from locomotion through to gameplay. 

I still go back to Arizona Sunshine every few months, and now more of my friends are getting Quest/Rift S, I'm looking forward to playing with them too. I am more excited about the sequel than any other title, to be honest.","Jan 19, 2020 at 11:47 PM",5, 1,

So it seems they've finally fixed the camera positioning issue, but now if you die, because of a lack of checkpoints in the campaign, you get set back an hour or so of progress. Do not buy until more checkpoints are added.

Dead Man DLC: 3.5/5 - Not too much too it, you play as a different character and go through a military base. Definitely worth a 2nd playthrough.

The [Censored] DLC: 2/5 - This was just disappointing after being hyped a new DLC was in the works. You play as a new character and have to go through a [Censored]. It's not exactly the most exciting environment, as it's dull and just boring to be inside. There seemed to be a huge lack of interacting with the environment this time around; can't pick up cups, nudge phones, open desk drawers, etc. It was a dull experience and honestly would say skip this if you're questioning whether or not to buy it.","Oct 4, 2019 at 4:07 AM",4, 17,

Objects in the foreground stutter and jump (some stationary objects even change their orientation as your head moves back and forth.)  Zombie movement is not smooth.

It completely ruins all sense of immersion.

I tried lowering the graphics quality to the lowest possible settings and the problem persists. (All other Oculus games run fine at the highest quality.)

Next thing was disappearing items... you set a weapon down for a second and look back to find NOTHING there. which REALLY bones you in the mine when i set down my flash light for a second... GONE. So i had to fire off bullets randomly to light my way through the mine and eventually got stuck and gave up...
And finally, i keep getting a weird black screen when i walk{IRL} more than 2 steps. it starts to fade out. if you back up then it goes back to normal, but several times i reached the black screen and it wouldnt go away AT ALL. I'm not sure why everyone is so inlove with this game considering the absolute game breaking issues i had just in my first hour playing it. please for the love of the VR god, fix this game.

2022-05-28 12:02:59.536339,Goffik,Not nearly as good as the reviews say...,"The fact that this game often still appears on ""best VR games"" lists really shows what a dire state VR gaming is in nearly three years after it's initial release.

Arizona Sunshine is a mundane, linear shooter with an uninspired and totally unoriginal zombie apocalypse storyline which we've all seen before. The VR gunplay is average at best, and the game's levels are rather boring and reuse the same bland environment throughout. The entire game involves just popping zombies from as far away as possible, with the occasional highly predictable ""swarm"" to offer some kind of challenge. In addition, the protagonist is an annoying idiot who's ""jokes"" are lame, predictable, and not remotely humorous.

The long and short of it is that they may as well have done away with the so-called ""story"" and just made this game a pointless wave shooter. It did almost nothing to show off the capabilities of VR three years ago, and it does even less now. You're far better off spending your money elsewhere, unless you can grab this in a 90%-off sale. There are much, much better VR titles out there.","Sep 21, 2019 at 2:04 AM",3, 7,

But given the success and vast number of recommendations, I thought I'd give it a try.  Probably the most surprised I've ever been about a purchase.  Tremendously fun, super well put together.  My only complaint is that you cannot really play this well sitting down.  From an accessibility standpoint, folks who cannot stand upright struggle with lots of VR games, and the calibration system isn't enough to make things ""work"" for a seated player.  My suggestion to the devs would be to please add a seated option to the calibration system, so that you could first pick standing/seated, then calibrate your hand positions, and the game would organize the inventory belt at an appropriate location and make your player apear to stand upright.  Without spoiling anything, the very last ""event"" in the game essentially requires you to be standing upright; if you cannot, and you've managed to make it through the entire game, you'll simply die at the end and never be able to complete it just because you cannot reach.","Jul 25, 2019 at 9:15 AM",5, 2,

I really love zombie games (eg:Dying Light is one of my all time favorites) and I knew this wouldn't have the same depth, length and gameplay as other AAA 2D zombie games...but I'll point form some thoughts.

Pros
Zombie theme - a favorite gendre of mine
Good controls

Cons
Sometimes a little glitchy with movement being it's weakest link.
Story...well, so far there are funny moments but the story is fairly bland.
Few gameplay elements...would love a more fleshed out version with more items to use, craft and give more to do...this is primarily a very straightforward shooter.

It's got the bones of a good game, but ultimately is relatively average. Maybe if there are future updates, DLC etc then the game will grow into something more special but right now it's not necessarily a must buy.","Jun 18, 2019 at 9:32 AM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 12:03:24.908798,BainPD,One of the Greats!,"Story: 5/5 The storymode is one of the best out there; sets the mood of despair accurately, the zombies aren't really a challenge until they're groups of them which makes them formidable.  Voice acting is great and once you play through the game you do feel a sense of completion.

Weapons: 4/5 There are many weapons in this game, all of which have their pros and cons.  Weapon damages seem logical even though the ammo is shared, which does however make certain weapons more dominant.  4/5 because there's no MELEE.  Needs melee.

Multiplayer: 3/5  Low pop, but still present.  Campaign mode is 5/5 with the story mode.  Not much changes there.  However, the Horde mode (2/5) is lacking, but still fun for quite a while.  My gripes with Horde mode is lack of map options and the desert map IMO is the only challenging one due to small space of operable play.

Conclusion: 4/5 stars for me.  My suggestions are add melee, more multiplayer maps, DLC (spending the extra cash is worth it for this game).  Maybe another story line for DLC.  Dead man was good, wished it was longer.","May 20, 2019 at 2:05 AM",4, 17,

Turned the speeds back down to stock speeds and the game started working for me. 

There were other bugs I couldn't fix.

-Once you get the hang of the guns it makes it fun to double trouble fred's day
-Reloading makes you constantly check that you have a full mag
-I'm pretty used to jump scares and horror games, but this game had me swerving fred hardcore.
-The storyline is great in my opinion. Even the ending didnt leave me feeling like I got GoT'd.
-Horde mode although simple is another level of fun because they come from all sides so anxiety is through the roof.
Alright now the improvements.
-I would highly suggest adding unique dialogue to the horde mode waves so it doesnt feel as a recycled.
-The game crashed on me 3 or 4 times throughout the campaign which was ultra frustrating when i was in the middle of finishing a level.
-Also would like to see some improvement to item throwing mechanics. There were too many times where I would try to throw a grenade and it would just stay in my hand for a split second longer and then just fall right at my feet.
I can't wait for graphics to improve, and for the VR to become more fluid.

My only complaint so far is the occasional horde attacks. I managed a few, even though it often times felt like the volume of zombies rushing me was intended for a group of players instead of a single player. Now I'm in a mine with little to no light to see. So, I'm stuck with only one gun and a flashlight in the other. A horde of zombies spill out on me. I've got the basic pistol in one hand, the flashlight, and a shotgun that constantly forces me to reload. I try to also jump around a bit to avoid them getting close only for my screen to turn black while I'm getting ganked.

I started messing around with AS again and discovered the full loco option. Wow what a difference it made in how much fun the game was. I was planning to wait to play it when I get the S, but now I couldn't resist. Just finished it. Game has it's flaws/limitations, but still far better than a lot of early VR games. I'm sure AS2 (if there ever is one) will fill in most of the blanks that were in AS, like jumping, more animation, melee, deeper, minor bugs, etc. Getting better weapons along the way felt great, and the occasional mounted super weapons (snipes, gatling) were brilliant.","Apr 14, 2019 at 12:44 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 12:03:43.944077,ksn,Must play,"VR has just a little bunch of good quality shooters nowdays. Arizona and DLC is definetely one of them.
Simple, immersive, good balanced meat shooter with large variaty of weaponry give you a freedom to put into rest loads of zombies. Various settings, multi languages support, interesting zombie waves trials as addtion to story line mode and enjoy black humor jokes your character permanently creates. You can play all mods solo or with your friends and get tonns of fun. All of in-VR moving and turning types in settings.

As negative is too simple story and set of a bit annoying moving bugs scattered over the world that probably never be fixed. No any kind of training to learn about your in-game capabilities (for example i found i can RUN in game much later i finish story line just because i could never think i should PUSH thumbstick for that). Graphics isn't perfect, but still is good enough.

The storytelling is sparse and well placed, just enough to keep a shoot 'em up style game on track and give you a little direction. The only huge flaw that my friends and I have noticed is that multiplayer gameplay is pretty sketchy. Our likelihood of getting through the campaign without one or both of us getting dropped from the server or just totally locked up was basically zero. Luckily there are quite a few drop in points, but it's frustrating to lose all your hoarded favorite weapons and ammo.  If this issue were fixed it would be an easy 5 stars.

And it's the opposite of the killer application. It 'a game that, despite the many updates, remains mediocre under many aspects: with the free locomotion I feel nauseous, and this is one of the very few cases in which it happens to me, because usually I feel more comfortable in vr than in the real world . Textures are very poor: grainy and little various. Same thing for the models: in Arizona there must have been many plurigemellar birth because the zombies are always the same: two or three girls in bikini, a middle-aged employee, a bald sports boy and a few others.. The levels are linear, boring. I paid this game € 17 and I regret it. If I think it usually costs more than twice, I feel like crying.

Between the crashes it's a decent game (with fairly nice graphics (although still a bit wobbly/buggy now and then), sound design, etc), with a decent narrative, but it's absolutely not worth its full prize. Since I purchased this for a couple of bucks (with some of the highly valued Oculus credits we received recently), it doesn't hurt me too much, but overall I'm still pretty disappointed (cause I was looking forward to playing this). There are a number of VR-games out there (f.e. Lone Echo, Arktika.1) that are way better in my view, regarding graphics, interaction level, sound design, narrative, weapons design, atmosphere and the overall quality of build. Sorry to say that I cannot recommend this game (and I certainly wasn't expecting this when I bought it, also due to the fact that I'm more forgiving towards VR-games cause of their experimental nature). So for now I'll give it a 1-star rating, but if build quality would be improved substantially (f.e. by removing the bugs that make this game almost unplayable), I guess it could go up to 3 or maybe even 4 stars, who knows ;-) [edit: since the last time I've played this game, maybe a year ago, it has become a better, more stable game, so now I'm finally able to enjoy this game, 4 stars it is).","Jan 18, 2019 at 11:58 PM",4, 4,

But if you've played the more polished games before (Gorn, Robot Recall, etc) you will really feel how old that game is in VR time. Locomotion is pretty bad, I got stuck just at the end of the game with no options but to restart the whole chapter. There's a lot of things you would expect from a VR game that this game has not, melee combat, multiplayer head movement, smoothing of multiplayer movement, better physics and handling of world objects (if you have a key, you don't get to put the key in the hole for example) and other things along those lines.

Melee weapons don't work even though you find axes/shovels and hammers here and there.

Teleporting does suck sometimes cause zombies will block your path or when you move up a staires your back is to them.
I tried switching from teleport to free movement and after 20minutes of playing got so motion sick that I had to sleep for over half an hour and still woke up sick (the turning doesnt work for me, it makes my head spin. TIP: Eating some cocktail nuts helped for me)

First of all, I am really enjoying Arizona Sunshine and despite A LOT of things I could want to point out, the overall experience and gameplay is very solid and fun.

QUESTION:

Can you please add melee combat, a lot of different melee weapons, and great mechanics so when you wack, slice or whatever.. the zombies, it feels responsive and ""real""... if you do that, it would be 5 stars, THOUGH.. more (and better designed) horde maps are also VERY welcome.

The story isn't really all that great, and mostly you just flip some switches, lower some bridges, and move on to the next area for a new wave of zombies. It is a bit short if you're good, and the DLC is super short, though not expensive. 

There's not much going on in the game besides ammo, guns, and zombies. There are masks you can put on, and some ducks hidden around the maps. Zombies are fun to kill. Aiming is mostly precise, allowing you to hone your skill in aiming down the sights. Ammo management can get tricky. Reload mechanic is very simple (empty clip, move weapon to belt), and makes it easy to get out of sticky situations. Weapons of the same class are pretty interchangeable. I do feel like sometimes I shoot the head and it doesn't register, or they barely block it with a limb. I use smooth turning and walk locomotion. The teleportation was frustrating to me.

Horde mode is fun, but once you get the feel for it, it's possible to get to high levels pretty easy. I played for like 3 hours straight and just wanted to die already (was around 30th on the leaderboard). I'll keep going back to horde mode and co-op campaign.

But I still had this feeling that just when the game is about to get started, it ends. The game really makes you feel like a lone survivor in an undead wasteland and get's really intense in the more zombie-dense area's and scripted sequences. The shooting is tight and responsive, and the guns all feel impactful and fun to use. I did have issues with my character clipping into objects and the game freaking out, spinning me around or at weird angles, this seemed to happen most in areas with lots of objects and ground clutter, I tried reorienting, repositioning, and recalibrating my sensors with no luck and it was frequent enough to be annoying when it was happening.

Sadly, the simple fixes it needs to get over its flaws not being addressed yet probably means they will go abandoned in favor of a new title. When the game paces itself to suit its own mechanics it really shines. Exploration and looting is really fun and immersive, as is pulling off ammo-conserving shots. Problems come to light during the many instances when you deal with a wave of enemies, zombies charging at you and not being shot if the end of your barrel touches or goes past their polygons. The problem is that zombies don't stand at a distance to accomodate this while they swing their limbs at you. They will actually stand INSIDE OF YOU leaving you helpless to move and have to shoot at your own body to hopefully put them down. Its really very goofy. When I die in this game it is from zombies standing so close that they are out of my camera view, or floor crawlers as you check around you first when you take damage before thinking to look down.","Nov 14, 2018 at 9:02 AM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 12:04:21.971141,julianperrott,Could be better,"I've played this a few times and my initial thoughts are as follows.

Zombies are hard to shoot in the head, sometimes you get it perfect, sometimes it takes a few shots unless they are really close.
The movement mechanism is horrible and ruins the VR effect, jumping from place to place is not natural, most of the time you don't even end up looking in the same direction after a jump. This is particularly bad in the dark parts of the mine. Also getting stuck on doors or other stuff is annoying. Lone Echo's movement is far nicer.
The gun is a pain to use, it is not obvious when you run out of bullets and need to reload. This means I die a lot when a horde of zombies attacks, trying to eject the mag, move the gun to my belt then re-aim with 10 zombies flying at me is not fun.

Opening doors with keys or using handles etc is confusing/unnatural when you are holding a gun/torch and I usually end up accidentally shooting my gun by mistake.

Picking up the ammo and putting it onto your belt is kinda stupid as sometime I drop them.

Normally I run out of time when gaming session, with this game I just give up and do something more fun.

VR is in trouble if this is one of the best games.","Nov 9, 2018 at 11:09 PM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 12:04:25.213588,SgtHK,Great Atmospheric Experience,"I agree with every positive review about this game, most notably its great atmosphere and realistic guns. However I do like to point out its flaws and what could be improved.

ALIASING: Although the game's graphics has realistic textures and lighting, it has the WORST aliasing problem I've seen in any game I've played in VR. This is especially noticable in dark environments with bright spotlights overhead; the jagged highlights shimmer like fireflies in the distance and are very distracting. This is less of a problem in daylight areas. Thankfully the immersion aspect of VR makes up for this problem; if this was a regular flat-screen game it would score a 1/10 in graphics for today's standards.

CATCHING MAGAZINES: When in-between zombie encounters I'd like my gun to be fully loaded. So I eject the magazine currently in the gun and reload with a fresh new one from my belt. But the ejected magazine still has bullets so I have to pick it up from the ground and return the bullets to my belt. I just wish I could catch the magazine as it falls off the gun, instead of having to bend down and pick it up.

GRENADE THROWING: I am a fully-grown adult with a trim, athetic body. However I feel like I have the muscle power of a 3-year-old child when I try to throw grenades in a normal overhand throw. Tossing them in an underhand makes them go further for some reason. They really need to put more acceleration into these things.

To conclude my review, I'd give this game 5 stars. But the aliasing problem in the graphics is too much of a concern for me, graphics-wise. So I subtract 1 star. 4 stars in total.","Sep 27, 2018 at 1:18 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 12:04:28.378247,EaglesStrike,Exactly what I was looking for,"Motion Sickness,
I am happy to say this game brought no such issues, and plays much like Robo Recall. (Motion Sickness stopped me playing Mage's Tale, so is a big concern when trying out new games)

Campaign,
No complaints, I didn't want it to end, but I couldn't stop playing until it did, and I don't feel like it was too short either.

Story,
Not, much to say, it is a means to justify your zombie killing spree not much more.

Gameplay,
At any one time you can carry 2 weapons on your belt, and 2 in your hands - I would have liked to be able to carry more but it doesn't impact the game by not.
The momenent uses teleportation, or free move (though it is not true teleportation as you must teleport to somewhere that you could have walked to in a straight line, thus you must teleport round a table not over it, and you can't teleport past a zombie) Both methods of moving are much the same in terms of gameplay, so don't expect either to handicap you.

Issues,
From my experience anyway, the two handed weapons dont work that well. I found myself often just weilding the bigger weapons with one hand anyway, as there was very little difference with aim, and it allowed me to use a second weapon.
Also, there isn't much in the way of a tutorial (Not that it really needs one) but there are little things that I missed as a result - I didn't know that you can store Grenades on a seperate section on your chest until I googled it afterwards.

Overall,
Brilliant, I am recommending this game to friends and family, and hope to try out the multiplayer stuff soon.","Aug 14, 2018 at 8:59 AM",5, 16,

2022-05-28 12:04:34.778894,Revving,Enjoyable but...,"This game is enjoyable but not by much. What this game does right is the voice acting and environments. It helps you to understand how the protagonist feels. I enjoyed how they made a somewhat short game feel longer than it was by adding various areas to the game. The graphic quality and sound quality are decent and the gameplay is enjoyable. However, the houses are lacking diversity so don't expect much there. There are issues in this game and they start with the aiming, it's pretty lousy. You gotta be dead perfect to hit from a distance. You pretty much have to shoot zombies at close range. This was the best and easiest way to deal with mobs. The sniper rifle is awful and needs to be fixed. It's like your sensors can't detect it properly; it's also fixed to the place where you find it so don't expect to carry it with you. Then there's the gernades, I mean seriously... You can't throw it more than 4 feet in front of you. Who designed that? The multiplayer aspect of this game is non-existant, either no one is online or the network is down. One other gripe, and this one is what got me mad, is that the DLC is not included. You have to buy it separately from the game. That's seriously a bad move on the developer's part. This game makes you wish there was more to the story because the story is weak. Aside from these cons, the game is enjoyable enough to play the campaign at the discounted price, but definitely not at the full price. In regards to the DLC, it's much better than the main game. There are new weapons with better sights which makes aiming better; and the intensity is there too. However, the DLC is very very short. Don't expect much for $2.50.","Jun 17, 2018 at 3:30 AM",3, 8,

2022-05-28 12:04:37.912615,Raunhofer,"Base game OK, DLC half-broken","The base game is a quite decent zombie shooter for you and your friend. This game is best served as a co-op game. Performance is OK, graphics are OK, level-design is a bit lacking but the biggest problem is bugs. The game has a lot of unfixed issues. Some zombies are visible only to the other player, you can get stuck in many places, teleport to oblivion, and at times the game just crashes. The game is playable, but feels rushed. Interaction with the game-world items is very limited.

In DLC you can't finish the silo mission if you and your friend die/fail at least once. After that, a crucial door for finishing the mission is locked for the non-server player, breaking the game. DLC is barely worth the 2 bucks.","Jul 14, 2018 at 6:07 PM",3, 3,

2022-05-28 12:04:37.990408,Pandahman,Zombie Shooter with a Story,"Arizona Sunshines was one of the reasons why I wanted VR.  Though the game is a bit predictable (pick up key and a waves of zombies come) it is a lot of fun.  It's not exactly challenging but the gun play makes it worth coming back too.  You have your solo story, COOP story, and solo/coop ""horde"" mode (keep fighting different waves of zombies).  The environment is great and plenty of weapons to choose from.  My only complaint is the way you reload is a bit annoying ONLY because I like having to grab the magazine and load it myself.  Also, the shotgun is extremely tiny that it is off putting.

Recent update brings in two handed rifles.  My only complaint is that they are not integrated into the game.  You either choose 1 handed mode (that has all of the pistols and sub machine guns) or 2 handed mode (that only has rifles).  Feels a bit weird not to just merge them together.  The DLC is very cheap because it is very short but I do not mind supporting the developers.","Jul 7, 2018 at 4:20 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 12:04:41.098232,PROJ3CTALPH4,Not Bad,"Arizona sunshine is pretty fun. But Its not exactly my top choice or style.it is really nice to have a campaign though. My biggest gripe is the dam teleportation crap. Okay if you insist on doing it then make it have a reason, like sorento does it cause you are a ninja. This game could of easily been a real amazing shooter with true horror, but nothing is scary about just teleporting around the map. Not to mention when a wave comes you can barely move around, or you are blocked from going to certain spots you just entered breaking immersion even more. Also would of been fun with so many blunt objects you can find laying around it sucks it's just cosmetic props and you HAVE TO always resort to using a gun.  I say stop focusing on DLC crap and work on the game you got already. Let us walk around freely, let us at least throw a punch at em lol. Some rifles would be fun also instead of sticky one handed weapons. Although I get it you got things like the sawed off shotgun which is clever. I can say if you are new to VR this will probably blow your mind. But if you have been doing vr for some time then in my opinion it's not my next best shooter for Oculus. But I did enjoy the campaign, especially when you find the glock variants.","May 30, 2018 at 3:46 AM",4, 6,

2022-05-28 12:04:41.137128,semanis,Excellent Zombie shooter!,"In my opinion,  this is another ""top 10"" game for the Oculus Rift.  I love that the main character (you) talks out loud to himself as you go through the game.  He really helps give you the feel that your a 'sole survivor' who's just barely holding on to his sanity, subject to fits of semi-macabre humor,  anger, and even depression;  all while fighting zombies, zombie hordes, and trying to find his way to a human enclave.

I also love that the weapons in the game feel realistic and there are no fancy gimmicks like laser scopes and other high-tech features;  you use your iron sights like [insert favorite deity here] intended.  The weapon variety is interesting too,  where you'll get a gun with night sights and not think much about it until later on when you're in a dark mine shaft.  You scavenge around for ammo,  which thankfully is fairly pentiful, and find interesting pistols (of all varieties, calibers, and with various features), sub-machine guns, shot guns, etc.  You're given an ammo belt that holds all your spare clips, shotgun shells,  grenades, and grenade launcher ammo.  When you find ammo,  you have to pick it up and put it on your ammo belt (where it auto attaches) and to reload,  you have to click a button to eject the spent clip from your weapon,  then touch the weapon to your ammo belt.  It's a good loading mechanic that gives you more of a real-world feel, without being too tedious. I also love that you can dual-wield and even easily switch weapons between hands should you want to.  In total you can carry four weapons;  one in each hand, and one on each hip,  where you simply reach down and 'grab' to swap weapons.

The story line is fun, funny at times, and keeps you interested in moving forward and trying to find a human settlement.  10/10 would buy again.","Jun 23, 2018 at 5:37 AM",5, 6,

Parts where you traverse the landscape with a few limping zombies here and there to triggered events where hordes of zombies come rushing at you... The gunmechanics are a good... A simple combo of arcade and realism where you have to eject every spent magazine but you insert a fresh mag by just moving the gun to your torso... The voiceacting is also superb and helps with the zombieapocalyptic atmosphere... It is kind of short but then again so are most VR-games and I would recommend picking this up on sale as the regular price is a bit steep for the time it takes for a playthrough...

2022-05-28 12:04:41.176024,Rezon8,Edited with Comments for Deadman DLC,"***Edit for Deadman DLC:  Recently played through the new content and enjoyed the experience.  It can be completed in about 60 to 90 mins depending on your skill and how much detail you want to observe in the game environment.  I also tried the multiplayer / coop horde modes through the player match feature and it seemed ok for the first few rounds but in some cases, there was a network error possibly from their servers, but I was able to jump back in fairly quickly.  I have't played the game in awhile and it did bring back a sense of excitement and tension I felt when I played AS the first time around.

Movement options are the same and generally smooth walkthrough in the command center except for certain areas where I seemed stuck as I maneuvered around and collided with the game assets.  Two handed gun play was satisfactory but the bullet count seemed off and I seemed to be able to shoot rounds without having them deducted from my ammo belt.  Not terribly bad bugs that I'm sure the developer will probably address in coming updates.

The story itself and voice acting quality were on par with the original although the main character wasn't as entertaining as the original.  End of Edit****

I still come back to this game even though I've finished the campaign months ago.  The developers keep updating and adding more content and I love the immersive feel being the protagonist in Sunshine.  The freedom of full locomotion added with realistic gun mechanics and a constantly changing environment were well done.  I wish they would have added melee suppoert since there were many objects scattered throughout that could have come in handy in combat.  Multiple horde maps have been added to keep the game play novel and fresh.  I have yet to try the multiplayer option because it keeps timing out during the search to find other players.  So after 5 months of Sunshine, I'm still impressed with this title and would highly recommend it to others looking for a quality FPS.","Jun 7, 2018 at 3:43 PM",5, 3,

However I already feel like this is better than the original. Its a lot scarier this time around. The environments are a lot more dark and ambient. The duel hand weapon feels great even though my hands are not mounted on a physical prop like PSVR.
Also the internet system has finally been fixed. I can find a game lobby right of the bat and join in. No need to find players on reddit first. 
There are however a lot of glitches. Specially in horde mode. The addition of leader boards don't matter much if every match I enter there is some eleven year old kid unlocking all the doors in the Undead Valley even before the game has started, than proceeds to provide me me with tons of ammo and equips himself with 2 machine guns in each hand that shoot without ever needing to reload.
There are still no psychical props that are able to hit other objects or zombies while holding them. Seeing your hammer go straight through a zombie is quite emersion breaking. I don't understand why as a developer you wouldn't think people who realize they can pick up a hammer or bottle aren't going to try and attack a zombie with it leaving them disappointed.

The protagonist's dialogue is laid-back and droll, the controls are positive and (to me) pretty logical.  Iron sights are useable after a little practise then preferable once the knack has been learnt.
Graphics are very good and play remains smooth for me so far.
I really liked the ability to interact with cars, cabinets etc. but agree with some other comments about the lack of melee combat, this doesn't detract from the game in the least - but would have been nice for some of the 'tight corner' encounters when you have been careless enough to miss the ample supplies of ammo!

There's not a whole lot of variety in weapons. Pretty much just 6 or 8 different pistols, 6 or 8 different submachine guns and they all seem pretty interchangeable. A pistol is a pistol and a submchine gun is a submachine gun. 

The graphics are not bad for a VR game but the environment is fairly repetitive. And the world just seems lifeless (and I don't mean the zombies).
Also the lighting seemed glitchy at times, especially in the darker areas. And the bloom was just stupid bright in areas.

Interactable objects seem arbitrary, some are, some aren't, and they don't interact with each other either. Try picking up a melee weapon or something similar and hitting a zombie? It won't work. The gun mechanics aren't great either. The graphics and animation are low effort, and the core gameplay is not very good.

It's a VR game, so I feel people often overlook the flaws that they wouldn't for other titles. Overall, if it was free I'd think it was ok, but don't spend any money on this.

Bought it in a duo, requested a refund but couldn't get one because of the duo pack. I'm sad that any money goes towards what is obviously a cheap cash grab.","Mar 26, 2018 at 6:24 AM",1, 4,

2022-05-28 12:05:09.817644,Slinky1331,"It's okay, I guess...","Formatting of this review is not my fault! O.R. WTF is wrong with you!
First off, buy this game on sale. 2 hours of single player campaign. 

Cons:
-The iron sights on the guns are useless and requires you to use a laser type sight instead. If you've been trained to use iron sights, like myself, it Effs with your head as you'll constantly find yourself shooting low. 
-Bad performance. I7 4.GHz & 1080 GTX. Zombies look like a slide show as they're running at me, frame drops and general shuddering.
-Terrible tracking. This is the only game that I've played that looses tracking of my controllers, constantly!
-Bad, Terrible, God Awful lighting. Some places are like playing in a vacuum where there is only light and complete darkness. The flash light is creates just a little circle of light while everything else is inky blackness. This hurt my eyes and my head. Also, some of the light sources in the game are better left turned off. All they do is blind you and hide enemies behind the blinding glare. 
-Clunky Locomotion. You'll find yourself handing up on almost every rock or edge. Be careful if using room scale as a simple step in any direction can cause you get caught in the game geometry, especially with a horde of Freds after you.
-Graphical glitches. It's like playing Fallout 4 VR all over again. Shimmering textures, buggy geometry, clipping issues galore. 

Pros:
-Funny dialog.
-Zombie damage is entertaining
-Decent game flow. I think this may be this games strongest asset as I found it with just enough casual exploring verses frantically shoot at zombie waves. 
-Story drives player progression. I found the single player story just compelling enough to make it through the whole game (a whole two hours) in one session. 

This game pretty much ranks just above some of the other poorly developed indie VR trash in the OR and Steam stores. This game has been out for a while now and still riddled with issues. Guess the devs update the code just enough to keep it playable.","Feb 20, 2018 at 7:56 AM",3, 6,

2022-05-28 12:05:12.997223,EddieNanakase,Amazing game ! A must have ! !,"I had already bought a couple of zombie shooter games. With the amount of shooting games that are available in the Oculus store, I wasn't too thrilled to play this game, boy was I wrong !  The game started like any other zombie game, you shoot one zombie here and a couple over there and the game makes you feel like there's nothing new you haven't experienced. It's after the first level that I started to play for longer periods of time. The graphics are really good. You get the opportunity to experience the use of a good amount of different types of firearms. The voice/dialogue is amazing ! The controls are really good. If you get stuck on a wall, try to move your face away from the wall to regain control of your character.  If I remember correctly, there's an automatic save check point half way through all the levels.  Oculus games aren't that big in general, sure this game is not as big as a console or PC game, but it's still decently bigger than most Oculus games. There's only music playing in certain parts of the game, giving it a really good zombie apocalyptic atmosphere !  Even though it's a horror game, they opted out from using jump scare elements, which I think it's better, they didn't have a need to use them. Instead, you get this creepy atmosphere.  Although you could put yourself in scare jump situations. Even though there isn't much of a story, it's fascinating to see how your character's story unfolds as he tries to survive. Also, the Campaign title screen shows that there's an option for 2 players, don't know exactly how that works. There's also a "" Horde Mode "" that I haven't tried. No wonder they don't lower the price for this game. Even though I bought it on special, this game is worth it at full price.

The story is okay, but that doesn't really matter. Every zombie-survival anything usually follows the same-ish story(surviving and killing). The gameplay is really fun, dodging enemy hordes and mowing them down with a decently sized arcenal of weapons. There are even different game modes to keep it fun, and even includes 2-player. $40 is kind of a hefty price tag, but if it is on sale, or you want to buy the douple pack with SuperHotVR, I would highly recommend this game to anybody that is looking for a fun game in VT, and/or enjoys shooters/zombie shooters, and would say to give it a try.

The graphics are solid, interaction with the enviromnment is okay, shooting mechanics work fine and the freedom of movement also is acceptable. The only downside to his is, that this game gets crazy too fast. And with that I mean as soon as the runners come in the difficulty explodes. It's too much stress to be enjoyable. And stress isn't same as horror. Shocking elements are nice and all, but as soon as you have no time to stuggle with VR controls it just gets unfair and less fun. Unlike keyboard and mouse or controller, the VR controllers are less responsive and sometimes refuse to do what the player tries to do.

Wandering the highways and looting cars by physically opening the doors, bending over and rummaging through the stuff inside brings a weird sense of immersion.

Pure gameplay wise, it is a bit barebones, but this game is definitely more than just the sum of its parts.

It especially shines if you have a friend to tag along and share in the sense of panic when you get swarmed, or to stand with, back to back, as you make your last stand.

This one is almost not a shooting gallery game, if it wasn't for the teleporting it wouldn't be one. The problem with this movement type is that when they unleash hordes of zombies you have much greater difficulty dealing with them than if you could move smoothly. With very small areas to fight the zombies in, you'll constantly be having to take focus off of the brain eating zombies to look at where you're able to teleport to, or to teleport behind/backwards. It ruins the immersion of the game severly, and what would have been an awesome immersive vr experience was turned into a clunky arcade style experience. You'll pretty much need to turn it into a shooting gallery to win, finding a single location to stand in and mow down the horde before they reach you.

I always get swarmed and killed by zombies and there is no way out, I can't even pistol-whip enemy's or punch them.

There are many spots that I felt could've used more pizazz or polish imo. Maybe it was because I played co-op on my first playthrough which had some stuttering/performance issues and the vibe is different when you are with another person. I played a half hour solo---- and there was definitely a better vibe and the performance (and graphics- weird) seemed better too.  

One thing that really bugged me though was that the main protagonist was, in my opinion, annoying. He was constantly yelling whiney things. Maybe a few times would be okay but he was relentless. IDK, maybe it was just me.","Jan 20, 2018 at 12:20 PM",4, 0,

Its actually quite short, finished it in one sitting over about three hours. And while it was exciting in parts if it wasn't for it being VR, I'd have turned it off after 30 minutes. 

The mine level is really good and worth experiencing. But please note. The game has a nasty habit of locking down your movement and trapping you in area's when you have clear stairs you could climb or other areas you can move into normally. this limiting of freedom artifficially can be annoying.

I knew it from when I put the winch in and rolled down the bridge,opened up doors and trunks to vehicles and closed the door on approaching zombies when I was in an office.these developers obviously meant business. I have to also say my heart skips a beat how, yes VR works, it puts you IN the game...but even better, some of the zombies like the faster ones, man...you really feel they ""see"" you and they look like they are very determined to get at you how they focus on you and you see their distorted faces and it appears they lock eyes with you. seriously it sends chills down my spine when one of the taller or faster ones get near. oh, and just hearing the character cackle when he finds grenades...that was certainly a moment LMFAO  .yes...it has flaws, looking far out things appear low res, and you dont have alot of roaming abilities,its a small game area and gun aiming is off...but you have to hand it to the developers for creating in my mind one of the first games that leads the way on the possibilities of VR. oh, one more thing developers....THANK YOU for implementing regular locomotion. I will never understand why game makers create these game worlds and then....leave out the ability to walk/run as we do in regular life. it totally defeats the purpose of VR. I understand some get sick in VR. well I dont, so thanks for not punishing me. one more side bonus...as someone who lives in an area that is bombarded with snow...it really had an unintended ability to give me an escape from the depressing grey skies here with the sun bleached look. and my ceiling fan simulating wind sealed the deal.another consequence of the power of VR. great job developers. cant wait to see what you do next.","Dec 31, 2017 at 9:55 PM",4, 5,

This is a full-blooded FPS adventure that’ll see you travelling across Arizona in search of other survivors of the Zombie Apocalypse. The shooting mechanics are excellent, the touch controllers work wonders in it and the whole game feels polished.

It would have been nice if they had added some human foes. As the zombies don’t do much more than run/walk at you. They can still be pretty dangerous when they come as a horde, and on normal difficulty the game gave me a good challenge. But I would have liked to have things mixed up a bit with a few fire-fights with hostile humans and the like.

As for the complainers?  Graphics? crank up the supersampling as far a your system can take it (goes without saying by now).  Short single player?  Play it on a harder setting and get your moneys worth.  Bad aiming?  Use the sights, all I can say is that if you use the gun sites correctly you will get a head shot every time; they may have corrected something or people may be used to some sort of auto-aim mechanic in other games, but seriously there is no issue with aiming.","Jan 6, 2018 at 12:27 AM",5, 1,

I first got this game on steam as I was given a gift card for Steam, but could not get the game to work on my Rift touch controllers so ended up getting a refund and buying it from Oculus store now works great (in single player only)
The reason I wanted this was to play co-op with friends, but every time I get a invite all I get is the steam store page coming up asking me to buy it?? I try to invite friends only to have no one join??
So for me as a single player game it is fine and a good VR game as a multi/co-op game it needs tweaking/fixing so no matter what store you get it from it will work as it should, and thats why it only gets 3 stars as I can not play it as I wanted it too.","Jan 4, 2018 at 5:16 AM",3, 0,

The horde mode looks great but matchmaking is broken, once again it takes the fun out. This game has been up nearly a year and it looks like nothing has changed. Note to devs - Fix the little bugs, fix multiplayer and make a new free mode with something a little more than just killing zombies. Now with the bad stuff out the way. I enjoyed this game alot in terms of killing zombies. The realness of going underground and it being so dark was scary. There is alot of really nice guns to handle including a glock 17 with a flash light, an m9, an uzi and many more. The way you scavenge for ammo is awesome, i love it, but once again that is all you scavenge for, apart from the odd burger you can eat to gain health. I dont reccomend you pay £30 for this game, wait till the price drops or until the devs update the game. This is only a play once game, there is nothing to make me go back and play more since the multiplayer dont work and there is no free mode and you cant do anything but kill zombies.

Playing in co-op is definitely worthwhile, forcing you to carefully ration out who takes which weapons and ammo (except on easy where bullets are plentiful)

I chose to play without teleportation, finding the independent movement to be more fun for me.

For those who suffer from motion sickness, the teleport system appears to work well.

Aiming can be a little wonky at times - where the touch controllers feel like they should be straight is generally a few degrees off for the guns.

It has good ingame vr support, but nevertheless feels like another Unity beta zombie game for me. Playing it with a friend who has a Vive is possible but required me to put the Rift on and off a dozen of times. Activate Portforwarding, sending friend the IP. Ingame the voicechat was broken. Friend did the calibration at the beginning wrong, so we restarted the whole game. Ingame there are random objects flying around attached to the other character. German voiceover destroyes the atmosphere quite often. The dark mine level was no fun at all. It's just complete black without flashlight. Your friend has no orientation if she does not look at the small light cone coming from the flashlight. Technically I think this is just Unity standard absence of light, which I have only seen in cheap alpha-stage games until now.","Oct 18, 2017 at 2:04 AM",1, 3,

- Scaling !! Cars are biggers than tanks. Objects are all over the place in terms of dimension (bottles etc..)
- Throwing Grenades: I can not for the life of me properly throw a grenade. I mean come on, how hard should it be to throw further than one foot away
- Interacting with objects: you can pretty much pick up anything and then.... do nothing with it. Food an drinks ? well you can only eat burgers, forget about drinking cans. 
- Melee fight: About interacting: You have hammers, axes, giant (see scaling ) pans, all sort of things that scream ""smash me in that zombie's face"", except that everything that is not a bullet with just go right through them. 
It doesn't have to be robo recall level of collision detection, but please, at least something !
- Polish or lack thereof. Interiors of cars are 1990's level of details. Stray out of where you should you end up staring out the world's sky box
-Zombie movement: there's something off about the zombie movement when they're close to you. I don't know if its bad depth management or jerky movement patterns, but I find it hard to shoot them point blank.  Feels like I have my gun right on their face and somehow it misses.
- Menus: this is common to other VR games. Yes having the menu part of the VR world's experience is fun, the first two minutes, then I don't want to have to fiddle with objects for 5 minutes everytime I want to change a setting or load a game.
This is not a bad game, and all the good points raised in other reviews are valid but I wish that expectations were a bit higher and devs encouraged to go the extra mile to deliver a finished product.","Oct 18, 2017 at 4:49 AM",3, 6,

I wanted something with a little more ‘story’ to it and Arizona Sunshine fit the bill perfectly. Some genuinely terrifying stand offs and gun fire that feels really well done. Some great mechanics too (picking up ammo and pocketing in chest and opening draws / car doors, to name a few) that really add to the emersion. I’ve not finished it yet, but I’m really enjoying the story and the somewhat light-hearted script makes it stand out from ‘just another horror game’. My ONLY issue and reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that of all the games I’ve played, this is the only one I have tracking issues with. Not all the time, but every now and then the screen will lag or hands will jump around, even when in perfect view of the sensors (I’m using 16GB Ram, i7 & GTX 970). The game has been more than engaging enough for me to see past this however and I’m really hoping there’ll be some DLC at a later date for more replayability.

2022-05-28 12:06:26.310904,jxjcksn,Awesome Game !,"I have been looking at this one for a while, browsing through the positive and negative reviews, but for someone that has a busy life and just wants to enjoy some crazy zombie shooting and isn't a counterstrike expert sniper, this game is a BLAST !

The campaign mode has just enough to get you going, but enough to let you figure out what you can and cannot do.  The movement is great with the warping, however, it does take a while to get the hang of positioning yourself to open boxes and doors and sometimes you can get a dim screen when you warp into something to deeply and have to try and get out again.

The WAVES you experience throughout the game, had my heart pounding, and when eaten alive... wanting to go back and try it again.  (*Sign of a well balanced game imo).

One critisizm I have is the lack of saves.  I was playing it myself and lost my progress on the first night because oif not shutting the game down properly.  The second night I tried Multiplayer, and seemingly, because of that, all my progress was lost AGAIN ! meh !  The game is that new to me I dont care, but I would like to see Multiple save slots or at least profiles in the game.

In short, great graphics, smooth gamplay (Playing on Alienware Laptop with 1080 Graphics Amplifier) scary sound and accurate shooting IMO.  When they get close you will crap your pants and start scrambling.
Oh and the narrative on the campaign was enough to make me smile and laugh all the way through.  Suppose the game merits Kudos or Critisizm based on what you call a Zombie shooter.  But with Robo Recall being the only other VR contender I feel that this game if polished further could be as good.

Great Game...  worth the VR experience !

Annoyed it went on sale on Friday 13th when I payed full price Thursday 12th :-(  Oh well !

2022-05-28 12:06:29.494531,FPS_LK,,"As some have stated, the iron sights are off a bit which at times proves to be a little frustrating. People are saying that the story line is great, but there quite literally isn't a story line. It's a L4D type game where the end goal is to escape. The zombies glitch out occassionally. Firstly, they have a stumble animation and when they are in that animation their model lags. To illustrate if you ever played L4D with a low interp and played on Valve's crap servers then the common would lag... it's like that. Secondly, on a few occassions I've had zombies go through walls even on obstacles that are a part of the objective where you have to blow up a wall. The audio in the game is decent, not impressive by any means but not bad. What is bad however is the positional audio. Often you would hear zombies behind you even though they are in front of you. Additionally, the environment doesn't impact sound at all. For instance, in the mines you could hear zombies and have it sound as if they are stuck IN THE WALL. There were a few times where I'd reach a dead end and still hear zombies... makes no sense at all. In terms of immersion breaking, especially in the early stages of the game, zombies would spawn out of these little holes and sometimes spawn in your line of sight. The game obviously has a ton of flaws but I'd say a 3 star rating is quite reasonable. Despite the flaws it is a really fun game and I don't regret buying it. I wish the single player was longer though (it's really short). That being said, if you're not dieing to play this because of the post-apocolyptic setting then maybe wait until it's on sale to purchase it.","Oct 6, 2017 at 11:28 AM",3, 3,

It took a second for me to get accustomed to the reload functions, but once I did it turned into a symphony of zombie death.  When I got a good hold of the teleporting, I could manage to move through and clear buildings of the undead in a proper military fashion, and precision worked until the horde descendes, lol.  However, when I had my brother over and gave him a test drive on this game, one thing became clear.  He is red green color blind, and so am I, but to a far lesser extent.  He had trouble seeing the very usefull red dot.  At close range he could see it, but the same shots I was making, he had trouble with because the iron sights don't sync well with the red dot.  I tested this myself in the game.  My prior military backround tells my iron sight aimed shot should of landed a perfect headshot, and when I lined up the red dot and peeped down the irons the sights didn't match.  The solution is either produce better iron sight aim with the dot, or randomely place different colored dot sights through out the game to give different color options.  Would have helped my brother a ton.  All that aside, an outstanding game!","Sep 30, 2017 at 6:46 PM",5, 5,

This negatively effects gameplay and greatly breaks immersion for me.

Despite all those problems that would get it a pass rating from basically everyone on a monitor, it is in VR and so judged differently. I still don't think it's a great game, there are far better VR shooters out there, but it is passable.

Lots of fun to shoot the zombies, searching for ammo and trying the different weapons.  Really creepy to walk throug the dark mine only with a flashlight in one hand and a pistol in the other.
I would recommend a 3rd sensor, because it could be difficult when you you are surrounded by the undead... btw, I never had a crash, lag or something like this. (Nvidia1060, i5-6500, 8GB, win10)","Sep 12, 2017 at 1:38 AM",5, 2,

The mine section was especially frustrating having to hold a flashlight in the most uncomfortable way. The controls feel clumsy, and where there are plenty of zombies there is not enough time to aim for the head for each one.

The zombies are simple enough to dispatch until you start getting rushed then things go crazy. I wish there was melee in this game.

2022-05-28 12:06:48.746722,FeraRelax,And okay experience,"The first thing I noticed was that moving around in the game, which is done by a teleport system, is a very jarring experience.
And you have to move around a lot. The teleport system is often blocked by objects in its path, and a general fickle to deal with to align the view to the direction you want to face. It would have been a much better experience had I just been able to walk around using the oculus touch joystick.

The second thing that got me a bit frustrated, was the unintuitive controls, I often end up holstering my weapon without intending to do so, or had it switch hands, in a critical situation. Throwing an object, such as a granade, feels like I'm about to let go of the touch controller, because of the controll layout, so I'm holding back on the throw and would rather not use such objects at all.

The general shooting feels good, and leave me wanting to go back. 
The exception is when the zombies gets close to player, the aiming feels off, my first response is to (want to) jam the gun up right in it's face, but the game doesn't really work that way.

It's an okay experience, but feels a lot like a pre-1st generation game, where the controlls have not yet been fully figured out. 
Yet, you can overcome this by teaching yourself the muscle memory required, but it is far from intuitive.

The price is a little steep for such an experience.","Sep 1, 2017 at 10:41 AM",3, 0,

At first play, the zombies are awesome as in VR, they are lifelike so giving the scares when they get close enough to attack.

Both movement techniques supported so you can move around your way. The only thing that doesn't quite fit in this game is the weapon management and it's potentially personal choice; you can't drop anything once you've picked it up, so you will fill your holsters and your hands until you have 4 handheld items and you can't change what your holding without picking something else up.

playing in free locomotion really makes this game shine, and horde mode gives the obligatory infinite replayability. 

im not certain about the full price tag, considering how long its been on the market, but at the regular sale price of 30 buckeroonies its definitely worth every penny.

i had no performance issues with 8gbddr4 ram, i5 7500 series processor and 1060(6gb)gpu. load times were maybe about 10-15 seconds long, not really certain about what everyone was complaining about in that regards. sometimes picking ammo off the ground is wonky, but you learn to make your palm flat to the ground, or to swap mags on top of objects.

You can pick up many objects but they don't interact with the environment i.e can't smash a bottle on table etc...  Overall I like the story but the gameplay doesn't feel polished.  Also, no ability to melee which is frustrating.

2. Zomibies animate poorly, stutter and frame skip constantly, and have wierd sudden  lighting changes when they die.
3. Aiming is really difficult - more so than any other shooting game out at the moment.  You have to aim down the sights, closing one eye to do so.  When zombies get into melee range, even when firing from the hip your guns clip through them.
4. No melee.
5. Loading guns means dropping the clip on the floor, then fishing around to pick it up again.  This is tedious as hell.
6. Opening doors can sometimes be awkward, and almost always has the door clipping through you if you open it towards you.

2022-05-28 12:07:07.828791,Vicarian,"Great Shooting, Short, Some Tech Issues","I'm sure this is in keeping with current VR game design, but the campaign is far too short.  However, there is an arcade-like Horde Mode, where you can test your skill against as many waves as you can handle.  This is fun, but I always find campaigns to be more worth it.  The Horde mode gets repetitive after a time, especially if your trackers decide they're just going to jitter.  The best part of the game, though, are the shooting mechanics.  I shoot in real life, and marksmanship fundamentals play a major role in how accurate you are.  Extremely well done.  Finding a SIG P250C in game was cool.  It's front sight post was a bit thin, though.  I carry the P320C daily, as a point of reference.  Speaking of the weapon models, apart from the 250 and the Beretta 92FS, the other pistols and shotguns seemed improperly scaled.  The two Glocks and the 1911 are too thin, and the shotguns seem small compared to the real life guns they imitate.  The subguns seemed fine, but I haven't held any subgun, so I wouldn't know for sure.  

On the VR sickness front, I was totally fine with locomotion.  Not a single instance of nausea, but I don't get VR sick.  Your mileage may vary.

On the technical side, performance seemed to dip when zombies would enter a stumble animation state, and the trailer park level had incessantly flickering shadows after collecting all the items needed.

TL; DR, Arizona Sunshine is great fun to play, with some of the best shooting mechanics in any VR game I've tried to date.  It does have some minor technical issues, but they don't wear on you.  Extremely well done, and worth the price.","Jun 22, 2017 at 11:28 AM",4, 6,

2022-05-28 12:07:23.803129,Deeperbeige,Flawed but fun nonetheless,"Load times are absurd, even running from SSD drives. Occasional framerate issues, even with decent processor/gfx. I often get stuck in walls/objects by walking up to them (with the sliding controls), leaning over the object to see if there's ammo etc stashed in it, then I can't move again until I lean right out of the object. The biggest sin of the whole game however is putting invisible walls up when a hoard attacks. Why can't I run up those stairs to the obviously strong defensive position? I could climb them just 30 seconds ago before I pulled the lever that triggered the hoard.

If you can get past all of that, the positives are strong. The gunplay is interesting and feels pretty good. The settings are decent and the narrative works well. It manages to be continuously tense and never really let you feel safe, while also not being unfair or too difficult.","Jun 19, 2017 at 5:06 PM",4, 3,

Guns and aiming feel great and gameplay is intense without being annoyingly hard.  Very satisfying popping zombie headshots.  You have to take a measured approach and save ammo and let them get in close.  The movement options are also very well implemented.  I find this to be the best transport system and it gives you silloettes of your sensors to help orient you. The movement option is also good and not nauseating if you have smooth framerates.  Only major annoyance with the game is the absurd load times, but the gameplay is so fantastic its forgivable.

The main hero is really funny, locations are well done. Inside you will find  many hours with good game play, especially thanks to ""Horde Mode"" and multiplayer.

What I dislike:
- You can't kill zombies with: hammer , shovel , or hard object - this is truly disappointing...
- Long load times
- Zombie animation are not smooth sometimes (it looks like  a bug)

 it makes you panic i like that and not many game can drag you in this much, aiming and shootting is brilliant looking down the sights for those headshots are challanging but satisfiying (at range). the game dosnt hold your hand at all you have to make stratagies to not be eaten alive this alone is changing because the point to move is a little clunky but not a game breaker. allso i love the fact you can have a torch in one hand and a pistol in the other. graphics and scenery is very good. best of all is the imerssivness of it all and your charecter helps lighten the mood with his jokes lol!

the bad; 
getting used to the touch controlls is hard enough but the in-game loading takes a fair bit of practice especially in chaotic times with zombies all around you. grenades are hard to throw sometime they land at your feet others land well theres just no feedback or levle of strengh put in the throw. blank loading screens! theres no need! put somthing to look at or atleast watch a loading bar i hate haveing to see if its crashed (only on startup) in game if fine.
movement like i said is clunky but you get used to it its not a big deal can be a little finicky at times but its OK.

if you have a small area to play in like me it dose brake immersion and i loose tracking but i have to take it with a pinch of salt i have a small room but its still fine hit my walls a few time :( i have 1.5m wide and 2m lengh, width is the problem for me 2m squared would be perfect. just bare in mind this VR is still in infancy it has many years to grow and for that reason is why i never knocked of a few stars :)

Shooting zombies in the face has never been so much fun, and at times I felt like I was Rick Grimes.
The game has a great atmosphere helped by a winning performance by the voice actor.
Graphics can seem a little rough. I had some issues with the models as some car scales were way off and the zombie horde was really a zombie group just repeated, popping the same ten or so zombies over and over just felt cheap.
If I tried to up the textures to high the game would just hang on loading, but on default settings load times were not too bad.

1) This game is overpriced. It is not worth $40. Worth maybe $10.. if that.

2) The graphics are mediocre. Models reused alot. I noticed this just playing a few minutes (the only few I could stomach playing due to lag, load times, etc)

3) The load times are ATROCIOUS. I've never seen a game take so long to load unsatisfying results.

4) The UI is extremely annoying. You have to pick up the 'settings' VCR tape and physically put it in a VCR to go to settings. Same thing to play campaign, horde mode, or whatever else.

5) Can't grab zombies or pistol whip/melee them... although this is a minor issue compared to the rest.

6) It lags in game which results in that weird nauseating feeling you get from VR sometimes.

What's not fun though is the crashes, usually when loading the next area. It doesn't seem very well optimized memory wise since it uses 8GiB of RAM + 8GiB of VRAM with ""very high"" textures (which are not very high quality at all, merely acceptable). Also, it takes a very long time (almost two minutes) to load, and seems frozen while loading. And sometimes it really is frozen and after a few minutes you remove your headset and see a crash report on the PC screen... Not fun! I solved most of the crashes on my high end PC (GTX 1070 with 8GiB of VRAM) by going back to the ""high"" textures setting (which results in blurry unreadable text). Once it runs though it runs well (no lag except when a ton of zombies are present). Also, the optional free locomotion is sickening at first, but you get used to it after a while, then it becomes much easier to move around than teleporting while trying to physically stay in front of the Rift's sensors. The story is pretty much inexistent, but the voice acting is good and gives the game an additional dimension. The campaign is quite short for the price (about 3 to 5 hours for $40), but it offers some replay value with the horde mode where you kill as many waves of zombies as you can.","May 12, 2017 at 5:48 PM",5, 1,

Apart from the fact you can shoot guns that don't ""alert the horde"" so to speak? For me it has to be the atrocious save points set before insanely difficult sections that are made to make you fail, and when you do force the player sit through them over and over and over again. A game that could be a fun power trip (like the Bullettrain demo) turns out to be annoying beyond belief.. and thats on easy! An irritating reload function, the fact you can't move at all when the horde surrounds you and a severe lack of ammo ruins the experience almost completely. Getting gud is not something I can be bothered with sorry. Next.

Edit: That review was for the original version. Since then the developers have improved things, added a free movement function and increased ammo drops which have voided some of my original statements.

---------------------------------
I got this when it was on the daily sale.

As a quick review of playing for about 2 hours there are very good parts of the game and some annoyance that I personally found.

1. Graphics are amazing
2. There was moments where I legitly got jumped by a zombie and freaked me out
3. Excellent voice acting in the campain
4. My biggest annoyance is the fact that the laser dot is red....in Arizona....with red stone everywhere, why a red dot? I'm normally very good in real life in aiming, but this part only annoyed me. I learned to get by, just getting nice and close. Lose too much magaiznes just waisting ammo. Easily a in-game practise use, but first out in the gate, was annoying

There are 2 game modes, each offering co-op/online multiplayer or offline singleplayer.  There is your campaign mode, while it is short and starts off slow, does picks up speed and ends on a note that leaves you wanting more. In fact the last mission was by far the best and was incredibly fun. Then you have Horde, which honestly for me, is slightly disappointing as the space in which you fight is tiny and the weapons you start with are very weak. The more waves you complete give you better weapons but because of the lack of space, it is not very fun for me. I do have one serious con and thats the grenades, throwing them is like throwing a 10 ton anvil and usually are more dangerous to player then to zeds. They seriously need to address this.. Game is still actively being patched and updated though and my hopes are high for the future. Just about everything is good from graphics, realistic weapons (except a couple), variety of zombies, immersive enviroments and amazing music.

Some of the iron sights are tough to see in the dark, but duh. This game is so rewarding because the guns feel realistic, and that makes it challenging. If you can't aim a gun then playing a game where you have to aim guns might not be the best choice. As for me, I love this game and come back to it more than any other in my library. The only complaint is the lack of mele. You can pick stuff up but it will only hit enemies if you throw it, not if you try swinging it at them. Otherwise, this game is well designed and very polished. A definite must for VR gamers.","Apr 18, 2017 at 10:27 AM",5, 0,

It took me a while to get used to the controls because with 2 sensors you have to keep your controls in front of you and try not to turn around. The game also wants you to look down the gun sights rather than shoot from the hip so I was missing a lot. 

I love how Arizona Sunshine builds adrenaline without being scary. The campaign is not too long but since I played 1 level max in each sitting it still took me a while to beat it and I felt like it was worth the money.

As we all know, VR is an emerging platform, so it's hard to compare games at this point. This would easily be a two or three star game on a console or PC due to all the little missing things that make a game frustrating. You can't melee, it's hard to join a multiplayer game, you can't pick up certain objects and the ones you can don't make sounds and don't interact with the environment, zombie AI and ragdoll is rudimentary but passable, etc. But all those negatives are outshined by brilliant gun mechanics, rewarding gameplay, and a fun and unique environment.

Now with freedom of navigation, as opposed to teleportation it's even better.

Now that I have, I have to say that, while I enjoyed it compared to a lot of other VR ""games"" out there, I wasn't as impressed as I expected I'd be. First of all, the graphics are okay... but, even turned up all the way, kind of meh. Robo Recall blows it out of the water, for sure. Secondly, I experience a LOT of judder in this game, even after turning the graphics down a couple of notches. I don't have that problem with any other game, VR or not. In fact, I bought a beast of a computer and have been able to crank every game up to Ultra with no problem whatsoever. Only Arizona Sunshine struggles. Thirdly, the design feels a little unfinished. There's no melee, and there are useful-looking objects sprinkled throughout that you can pick up but which don't do anything. For instance, there are medpacks everywhere that you can grab, but they don't do anything. Just props. You only get health from burger patties. There are water bottles that appear full but do nothing. Backpacks, canned food, etc. Look useful, but all just decorative. As a dev at major studios since 1995, I can say it feels like they intended to have more pickups but then either ran out of time or balanced gameplay down to only a couple of pickups w/o removing the universally recognized ""useful"" objects (why have an obvious army ""medkit"" that's grabbale but useless?). Beyond that, the game is repetitive. Move from A to B, picking off stragglers. Fight a big horde at the checkpoint. Rinse and repeat. Searching cars is cool, though the only thing to find is ammo. Also, the aiming feels wonky. Overall, it feels like *most* of a game... but is not quite there. I hope they keep developing it, but because it's not marked ""early access,"" I assume this is it.

The gunplay leans too much on ""realistic"" accuracy -- other Touch titles have done better balancing challenge vs. ""I am a BAMF"".

2022-05-28 12:08:31.088670,y4n0_Vh_Qc,Its the best single player but...,"So I have 5 VR games.
I think that they are all cool in their own way.
I love VR and I'm a impressed 30 years old man that was dreaming of this as a child.
I don't regret my spendings to be able to get VR but sometimes I get to wonder if it would have tasted even better if I would have been more patient...
What I mean is that after the fifth game that I own I was feeling like is there a game that I will feel after playing it that it is deep and complete without it being a sports minigame, multiplayer only or free to play but not to be pvp competitive game. 
For the sixth game that I was going for I decided to take my time before investing because I guess that I'm very impatient when it comes to VR stuff.
After spending hours of search to find the game that would have me win over as a gamer, I decided that I would put my money on Arizona Sunshine. 
I found myself in awe once more as all my other VR game experiences but the game ad to go and piss me off with missing something and its the fact that this game is multiplayer but doesn't offer public servers wich means that we have play this based on us getting Oculus friends and inviting them so here's my score for what would have most likely been a 4 star otherwise because if you reach perfection with me then your greatly different in a good way even more so that I own other games on Oculus that have public servers and this apply as well as if the cost related to server maintenance would have bump the game value by 20$!

This game is a classic first person shooter with some really great VR ideas. Your weapons inventory is on your body so you have to grab the gun you want. Likewise if you want a grenade and reloading is done from your ammo belt. Much better mechanism than in left for dead. The guns 'feel' different and the [optional] teleporting doesn't detract from the first person feel. Best VR game I've played so far.,"Feb 28, 2017 at 4:08 AM",5, 1,

The game honestly requires a room-scale setup, something that's not advertised during purchase. While the teleport mechanism works okay, it's simply too slow for the pace the game sets for itself. You WILL die because of the mechanism is bad, if you do not have room-scale.

Campaign mode also has a lot of bugs. Flashlight light doesn't bounce. Sound stops working and game must be restarted. Controller will not buzz when shooting.

I will happily change my rating once the game improves. But until then, expect a somewhat buggy (but still enjoyable) experience.","Jan 22, 2017 at 2:47 AM",3, 4,

That is, until I tried this game. VR has taken a genre that I've never really liked and manage to make me not only enjoy the experience but replay it mutliple times. 

As a side note, this game also helped me get over my locomotion sickness. The first time I played the game without teleporting I felt sick after about ten minutes. Then I tried it again the next day for 15 minutes and came back to it later in the day and didn't have any more motion sickness. Bonus!","Feb 20, 2017 at 5:40 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 12:08:40.661461,LowlyKnight,A MUST BUY!!,"There are 3 must buy games with touch controls right now and this is one of them!  The other two being Super Hot and Call of the Starseed.  I really enjoyed Starseed, but its very short, Arizona Sunshine on the other hand is the first VR game with touch controls I've played that feels like an actual, full-on game experience.  The control scheme is fantastic.  You can hold a gun in each hand, with an additional gun holstered on your right and left hip.  By looking down you can see how much ammo you have of each gun, and you'll see your grenades hanging on the right of your chest.  Once you start to get the hang of things the more intense fire fights will have you quick swapping your left gun for the one on your left hip while you fire with your right hand gun, grab a grenade, toss it, reload, destroy zombies.  After playing starseed I did wish I had a backpack so I could throw excess ammo and food into it, but it turns out that there's enough food and ammo located near spots where big fights happen that you'll be fine.  If story is what is most important to you, play Call of the Starseed, a short but pleasant story.  This games story amounts to your character talking to himself throughout the game.  As a fan of apocalyptic Walking Dead type fiction I enjoyed being a loner who talks to himself and is most likely a little batty.  The gameplay is where this game shines.  Once I found a revolver that looked like rick grimes' gun I never put it down.  You'll pick up some other fun weapons as well, I won't spoil that.  Nothing super crazy but after finding multiple pistols it truly feels empowering to find some weapons more powerful than pistols... I still stuck with my Rick Grime's Revolver for the most part.  The game looks beautiful.  I typically can't handle horror games, and I liked that this one isn't about horror and scare tactics. I love this game and highly recommend it!

It doesn't get that last star because it needs full locomotion! While the movement system is fine, a full locomotion option for those of us with strong VR legs would make this game easily one of the finest games so far - there were so many times that I wish I could have just walked around to explore the well made environments! Even very slowly!

Also, had two crashes, though not as bad as what some others have been experiencing. Literally launched right out of the gate for the first time by crashing. Lame, but didn't crash again until THE VERY LAST ACTION OF THE GAME. 

Still though, so very well done guys. 
Must buy.

You did it, you added the full locomotion! Whether you guys had planned the implementation from the start or did it because many of us were requesting it, THANK YOU.

Really fun game and definitely one of very few titles where you can enjoy shooting so much.

I decided to purchase after I saw that locomotion had been added which is a real bonus as I prefer to not break the immersion with teleporting all over the shop. 
I found the interactions brilliant, the voice acting pretty fun and the visuals are fantastic. 
It seems like a high price for a game that isnt very long, but I can say with conviction that it is worth it. Took me a few evenings on and off playing and I only have a small play area but I managed to move my sensors in such a way that I could be detected when picking things up off the floor.

Now, I only have 2 sensors and a 4'x6' rug I play on in my basement, so when I say I don't have any issues with tracking maybe that is the reason.  Yes the teleporting kind of sucks but honestly for people with minimal play areas it's the only way you're going to play a game in VR.  Using the teleporting controls with myself just standing and turning to look and shoot I have had no problems, and when I do it's simply because I have wondered off my play area.

I was able to get used to ""teleporting"" system in less than 15 minutes! With Oculus Touch its even fun and I like the idea that you can easily set your view direction before you teleport. On the other hand, level of immersion is great. The way how you open drawers/doors in live scale by grabbing handles and pulling them. Having ""your own"" hands. LOVE IT! Keep those mechanics and I will be coming back for more your games. Can't wait for moment we will pump enough money into industry so it will start producing ""real"" AAA VR games. (And I mean it.

Locomotion is a welcome addition but smooth turning is way too slow and induces motion sickness in my VR hardened stomach but thankfully incremental turning is sufficent.  You can get stuck in the game world with locomotion and it is frustrating especially during combat but you can just lean into the play area and you will be able to move again to get unstuck.  This game does demonstrate very well how flipping amazing AAA games of this nature will be in the future.  If Fallout 4 is anything close to this it will be amazing for sure.

Pretty decent voice acting coming from the character you play as who can be just as believeble  when cracking jokes about the dead freddys as he can when he sounds optimistic, and sometimes desperate, to find other survivors. Shooting in vr is solid, although i would like to have some option for a  crosshair or red dot sight/laser, without having to change the overall difficulty of the game mode (turns out im a pretty crappy shot shooting at most zombie's heads further than 10 meters out it seems lol) the game is a little on the short side but still very fun to replay regardless. Had quite a few crashes on my when trying to boot the game up or when transitioning from one level to the next but other than that i havent noticed any other significant bugs  *UPDATE 1/26/ 2017* The addition of full locomotion for movement makes the game feel surprisingly fresh! traditional duel thumbstick fps controls feel great for those that can handle it without getting motion sickness. It certainly makes positioning yourself much easier especially when doing things like getting ammo and opening doors which was a bit of a chore with teleporting even after you get used to the teleportation system. Also the game feels so much more immersive with it.  the only downside technically is that it makes graphical stuff like texure pop in more noticiable because the game wasnt  made to release with fluid movement. Also, gameplay wise, teleportation is obviously faster than thumbstick walking/sprinting . Despite these issues, im not going back to teleporting.

The graphics are not the best or most polished I've seen, but they do the job.  The interactivity with the environment, however, is fantastic.  Rummaging through cabinets and abandoned cars to find weapons while zombies surround your space is thrilling and well executed.  Note that the experience is significantly improved with a 3 camera setup and room scale VR.  I can hardly wait to play this game again when full camera movement is an option (the game currently uses a ""blink teleport"" movement system).

2022-05-28 12:09:15.916074,flute111,Dont be fooled,"I am an avid supporter of vr and technology but I must say that I bought this title to support the above statement in terms of if us as consumers dont embrase the new tech and support game makers in their endevours it will all go to waste for another few year.

I read with anticipation all the reviews and moved past the ones that had issues installing or crashing as this is not the game as intended.

However this is not the holy grail,  it is a simple and straight forward shoot em up from a static position.  The guns are as accurate as you set them up to be (I have spent longer doing that than playing) and is not as special as the delusional reviews that you may read previously. 

Buy this to support a failing industry if like me you desperately want this to be the next great thing for gaming.

However an inteligent review would say, its not bad, it does what it says on the tin, but it is flawed, the movement is rubbish, the engagment is not perfect and as a game it is 20 years ago brought modern by the new tech.  

This does not even get close to what is possible so forget the others saying that developers have something to learn here.

If I could be so bold as a simple consumer that is onside to give advice to developers.

DONT rehash stuff that was ground breaking years and years ago to put in vr and call it new.  Its NOT new. 

There is no creativity here its a cheap and here is the worst,  the best at the moment,  way of using vr to sell a title.

If this title was not in vr it would of received a massive ear bashing even if it was an indi title for .99p

Truth as I see it,  harsh yes, honest...very.

VR can be a game changer,  we are no where near that point yet.

Keep going and good luck to developers,  I mentioned before I bought this crap to support you.  But I will be honest with my appraisal and I believe you already know my points.

See you soon,

Regular crashes and I had the '3 feet tall' problem where you had to spoof the height in the Steam setup to get it right.  The aim was way off and it studdered a lot.  I got a refund.  I then saw it played at a friend's via the Oculus store and his worked fine.  I purchased it again via Oculus and it works great.  

Aim is right on now (you can test this by using the laser sight on easy) and I was even able to shoot zombies off cliffs way above me.   I would put this in the top few with SuperHot and I Expect You to Die.  I only experienced one bug (I could not get into the mines after killing all the zombies, I think a zombie was stuck behind an object on a cliff), but replayed that part and it worked.  Not a single issue since.  The mines are very scary and the environment is spooky too.  I definitely panicked a few times to the point I dropped my guns and flashlight.  

Not sure why others are having issues, but I'm using Windows 10, i7 3930K OCd to 4.2Ghz and a GTX 1070.   I ensure no other programs are running in the background (that includes setting your anti-virus not to do idle auto-scans which crushes your CPU during games).  Using 3 sensors and tracks perfectly.  Again, I did experience issues with the Steam version when it was first released, but the Oculus version seems to work very well now.  I play short chunks of time, checkpoints allow for that and game length seems reasonable.  Compared to other VR releases, this is a great game.

Hope this helps someone!

UPDATE:  Updating from 4 to 5 stars.  Upon completing the game and considering all the VR Oculus releases to date, only Superhot VR gave me the same sense of immersion (for a shooter) and the feeling it was a complete game rather than a 'preview'.","Jan 5, 2017 at 7:39 AM",5, 1,

The aiming is terrible, you can barely see the iron sights so you pretty much have to learn to shoot without proper sight aiming.

It's basically a wave shooter with a tiny bit of tacked-on freedom of movement. It has alot of potential, I just hope updates can correct some of the fatal flaws.

Well done to developers for listening to their customers and reverting a dumb decision.



UPDATE 15th Dec 
Have now played the game a substantial amount, and not only am I glad I bought it, I strongly recommend everybody do. It's one of the few full length singleplayer experiences in VR right now.  

It's an intense experience. One minute you are a sharpshooting badass, calmly headshotting slow zombies one at a time as they advance towards you. Next minute you are a shrieking child, blindly hip-firing entire magazines of ammo into a clump of fast zombies that are charging at you, wishing you hadn't used your last grenade.

The shooting is juuuust difficult enough to feel rewarding when you are headshotting the aforementioned slow zombies. But also juuuust easy enough that when you turn around and get surprised by that pack of fast zombies, you can still come out of it alive without burning through all your ammo.","Dec 15, 2016 at 2:10 PM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 12:09:44.911584,VulpinePanther,"Triple A in VR, But Not Perfect","This is the first game where I felt like I was playing a non-experimental VR title. This comes with a interesting narrative, plenty character and quality visuals. --- The game has a real aim mechanic that requires you to actually line up the shot, and pick off the zombies one by one (preferably via headshot.) Getting the shot just right is incredibly satisfying. Scavaging I found to be quite rewarding and fun as well, opening doors and trunks of cars made me feel like a Walking Dead character.

 --- However, it also comes with the lineararity and diluted mechanic quality of said triple A titles; Teleporting around proves to be an even bigger hassle than the potential simulator sickness of locomotion, especially in tense situations when your teleport beam is obstructed by invisible and obscure bounding boxes, leading to your death more often than not. Giving the option for artificial locomotion is a MUST for games like these, as the teleporting system actively prevents me from enjoying the game a lot of the time. I also end up accidentally hitting the analog stick and turning ninty degrees when I two hand handguns for much needed aiming assistance during waves (the option to turn this off would be amazing for this reason.) One other big gripe I have is that there seems to be no way, to my knowledge, to pause the game without exiting, which is a pain if you need to briefly exit VR and haven't hit a checkpoint yet.

 --- All in all, I'm really enjoying the game. But the control scheme shoots itself in the foot for the sake of comfort. If we were allowed to turn these comfort features off for something that is more responsive, it would significantly improve the game.","Dec 23, 2016 at 11:48 PM",4, 0,
