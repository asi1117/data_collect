2022-05-28 20:09:36.771643,Issur,It feels amazing !,"Some people don't realize how difficult it is to get to these different locations and have developed the high technology to capture these incredible environments and allow us to ""be there."" I appreciate and recommend it to anyone to try.

Also, it is nice that they are constantly adding new places for us to visit.

It's an inspiring and, at the same time, relaxing experience.",Oct 8 at 2:15 AM,5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:09:36.786603,XLINE99,Overpriced,You can Just play Google Earth VR.  And the interface and control is literally broken,"Jun 23, 2021 at 10:53 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 20:09:36.801563,BProcter,Stunning and enlightening,"A truly exceptional piece of work. I have only browsed a fraction of the locations but already I have been giddy with awe at so many things I've seen. I really like the meditative pacing and subtlety of the piece as a whole, which encourages a slower, more attentive approach to the content, which is worthy of it. We have all looked at so many photos of the Antelope Canyon slot, but nothing prepares you for the sculptural force of its actual shapes - you can imaging the flow of the water around you making those forms, as you stand in it. And the hanggliding experiences are a hoot, allowing views and experiences not even possible in reality. Well worth the purchase!","Dec 10, 2020 at 8:38 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 20:09:36.816523,BLADE_13,Great experience,Keep adding more content. Maybe a option menu to increase resolution and smooth turn.,"Jan 2, 2021 at 7:35 PM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 20:09:39.930348,kimblarsen,Magical virtual visits to places of awe,"I have had the great pleasure of being to a few of the many awe inspiring sites featured in Blueplanet VR like Yosemite Valley, Grand Canyon, Iceland, Gamble House, the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest of the White Mountains, an unnamed ruin or two and Upper Antelope Canyon. Many of these places are usually very crowded when visiting, and some are near impossible to get to and other are for all practical purpose inaccessible. While one could want for higher resolution on textures in some environments it is the experiential quality and sense of presence and feeling of grandeur that makes this title shine. In particular I would like to recommend the Upper Antelope Canyon, the Carlsbad Cavern, the Indonesian temple and the unnamed ruins that allow the highest sense of presence for their technical quality but more importantly for their restorative power and feeling of awe!","Jul 5, 2020 at 4:11 AM",5, 20,
2022-05-28 20:09:39.945308,nikolang,"Nice places, broken controls","The places look very nice and there are a lot of places available. Much better detail than google earth vr for example. 

But the controls are one of the worst I have ever seen in a VR-Application for this price. They should really work on that. If they do, this could be a really nice experience.","Aug 15, 2020 at 6:59 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 20:09:39.960268,vfxfun,Must have VR experience!!,So happy this came out now! Being able to visit sights like these in what I would say is true VR is just Amazing! This is not a 360 image or 360 video this is 6-dof experience where every single part has been scanned in made into 3D models. This is a close as you would ever get to the real deal!,"Jul 6, 2020 at 5:06 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 20:09:39.975229,Natyskillz,Not worth it,"yes there are many spaces, but within those spaces you can move all of 5 ft? I definitely thought for the price it would be better than the free google earth Vr in street view. Would not recommened.","Jul 15, 2020 at 3:00 PM",1, 12,
2022-05-28 20:09:39.989191,Clickingtoenails,Very immersive,I could literally feel the coolness of the caves and rock areas. Very immersive! Music is perfect. A very meditative experience I will be coming back to often.,"Jul 6, 2020 at 9:50 AM",5, 7,
