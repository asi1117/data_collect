Congrats!!","Feb 16, 2021 at 5:51 AM",4, 3,"Hey KomoKaru!
Thanks for the review. There is a gate in the dynamics plugin. A better sample editor is on the list. Not sure what you mean by make loops, you can record in the avatar/audio recorder and choose one shot or not to loop. Join our discord to discuss any requests at https://discord.gg/mg6ZJHx"

It is the most sophisticated DAW in VR that I have ever came across. I definately recommend Tranzient for those that want to make music and create cool visuals. 
I look forward to seeing this app progress and what the future holds for Tranzient. This is definately the macdaddy DAW of virtual reality.","Dec 11, 2019 at 10:54 PM",5, 10,
