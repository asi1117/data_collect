2022-05-28 20:47:15.594010,Artist3d,Can you give anything but 5 stars?,"Ok 11!!! This is the eye candy of metadata that really makes VR so compelling. While we have all seen 'Cosmic zooms' over on a screen from a couch or movie theatre chair,  who knew we would be ensconsed in the first-person perspective of Olaf Stapledon's great StarMaker novel --- loving the manual mode of rotating & zooming, stopping by star clusters, suns and galaxies innumerable out, out out - in in in so deep and so far, the perfect active meditation for a really joyful self discovery of just how easy it is to realize all of what you can be aware of in the pure relativity of consciousness. The shorter review of this application would simply read: Thank you.",Jul 31 at 5:12 AM,5, 3,

This is just unbelivable!,"Jan 15, 2021 at 1:40 PM",5, 1,Hi Louis. Thank you very much for your positive opinion. I am happy that you enjoyed the Orders of Magnitude.
2022-05-28 20:47:15.654847,Angelina Starr,Incredible interactive ride!,"Beautiful, interactive, engaging and dare I say - quite humbling.  As the son of a professional astronomer, I have always held the vastness of the universe from the smallest scale out to the edge of the cosmos in utter awe.  This VR journey really accentuated that feeling.   

I have only one very minor suggestion - improve the looks of the ISS and the astronaut whose brain we borrow for the inner space ride.  After witnessing the beauty and detail of the rest of the fantastic voyage, I found the lack of detail on these to actually be a distraction.  I was mildly surprised to see the apparent lack of attention given these two integral aspects of the journey.

One more thing - if the devs do decide to add narration, I hope there is an option for taking the ride without it.

Anyway, notwithstanding the very minor caveat of graphic detail on the space station and astronaut, I still give this a solid 5 stars.  Well worth the view.","Sep 3, 2020 at 11:58 AM",5, 1,"Hi Double_Shot. Thank you for your honest review! I am glad you overall enjoyed the experience. Yes I agree, the ISS and the astronaut are lower quality. I am currently working on an update and they will get improvements! Stay tuned :)"
2022-05-28 20:47:18.782482,blueperfluous,,"From the infitely tiny 6-dimensional matrix of string theory folds to the ultimately vast outer radiation rim of the known universe, this VR experience allows you to take in the broadest perspective of scientific magnitudes currently known or proposed. Your human point of reference for this journey is an astronaut floating near the International Space Station. Your hand controllers move you into the smallest realms of his brain cells and out to the edge of the observable universe. Every step along the way is beautifully rendered and interactive, allowing you to pull objects in and view them as pop-up text explains what you are viewing. The controls take a little getting used to, and some items may escape your attention on initial viewings but, with repeated use, you will continue to be amazed at the mind-boggling truths of our shared human understanding, proven, tested and exposed by decades of scientific observations and analysis.","Jun 23, 2020 at 8:06 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:47:18.800434,Clickingtoenails,Amazing experience and very well done!,"I have been through a lot of these educational experiences and this one is really good! I love the fact that you can grab and look at things. This is awesome! I am going to be going through this again and will be showing others. Can't wait for additional enhancements, but not sure a voice over would be that welcome. You kind of want to just be in awe.","Jan 25, 2020 at 12:45 PM",5, 19,Thank you a lot for your feedback! I am glad you enjoyed the experience. I will be working on adding more content soon.
