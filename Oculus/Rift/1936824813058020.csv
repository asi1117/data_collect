(?!?!?) This is out of early access right?","Apr 2, 2019 at 6:53 PM",1, 0,"There was no need for a start in the menu, because you were already in the game and in the ruins of Summerwind.  I don't make games to hold hands of gamers.  It is not at all an easy game to solve, and only a few have taken the time to solve it in full.  I like to think of this game as a VR coin hunting game of collecting achievements and avoiding ghosts.  Each time you start, you always start on level 1 like an arcade game.  The more you play the faster you get and eventually uncover all the achievements. If it ever broke $500 in sales, I was planning to add an update with a casual play mode to just explore the house.  But after a year it has only made $180. So I agree with your review of 1 star.  It could be better.  But it is hard, and I feel your frustration."

This is a fun horror game where you have to zoom around the map collecting coins and avoiding the enforcers that will dump you elsewhere if they catch you. You also have to find runes to use as keys and the jump scares are mild but fun. Summerwind was/is an actual place, so it’s nice to see a game built on the haunting legend. But whatever you do, don’t break the bottles! The only suggestion I'd have is to have the enforcers despawn for longer times as they can find you almost instantly and running doesn't always work.

EDIT: This game was tough, but the haunted house was the best part. I liked the spooky dolls and other surprises, though the caves beneath were a nice touch too. This is more action/adventure right now, but it's still a fun game though a little out of my wheel house.","Aug 5, 2018 at 2:41 AM",5, 5,
