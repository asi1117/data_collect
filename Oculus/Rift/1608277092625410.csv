The rules aren't even close to real life, the AI is extremely dumb and the physics are really stupid. I got the game on a discount and even then this game isn't worth it.","May 12, 2020 at 10:04 PM",2, 3,

Get Eleven Table Tennis if you care about physics, or even any of the other options are better than this. The physics bear no resemblance to reality.","Dec 1, 2019 at 9:38 AM",1, 13,Thank You for your opinion. We will do it better and try to fix bugs.
2022-05-28 18:52:06.029630,MadMaxToo,"Nice graphics, some fun, but broken","The vibe and the graphics are quite okay. I really like the trail of the ball.

However, there are things wrong with this game that need attention, before I will play it anymore.

Firstly, and I guess foremost, is that rules of table tennis are simply not followed at all. 
You could bounce the ball 5 times across the table in a serve and it will still be a valid serve. 
You think you are about to hit the ball off the other end of the table but the AI hits the ball back, on the full.
The ball appears on a trajectory that would likely just go over the net or tip the net and go over, but instead the game frequently gves the animation that you hit it straight into the net.
Want to win? Just lob the ball even a tiny bit, and the AI will miss it.
Want to serve how you serve in real table tennis? Forget it, you will need to serve standing facing the table and sort of dropping the ball from above the bat so you can serve. I found it impossible to hit shots when my body is not facing the table.  You can't serve by tossing the ball up as you do in a real game (not with consistency anyway).
Try the hardest setting of hitting and I can't even make contact with the ball at all.
Don't bother trying to smash the ball by swinging fast, just swing slow.
Keep serving until you lose a point? Not heard of this method of play in table tennis.

I want to like this game due to the nice look of it, but, sorry, in its current form (Sep 2019) it is too broken to play against AI and I honestly can't recommend it unless you enjoy frustration.","Sep 21, 2019 at 9:29 PM",2, 3,Thank You for your opinion. We will do it better and try to fix bugs.
2022-05-28 18:52:06.045586,SultansOfSwing,It SUCKS!,The ball goes through my racket every time I try to hit.  And the bot turns the ball invisible so I can't see it.  I don't recommend this game!,"Aug 4, 2019 at 5:34 AM",1, 4,Thank You for your opinion. We will do it better and try to fix bugs.
2022-05-28 18:52:06.060546,tacojack,zero challenge,the game is too easy. i got to the iron man guy beating each one 11-0 everytime i go online to play against real people and it said there was only 2 people playing the game.,"Jul 21, 2019 at 12:50 PM",1, 2,Thank You for your review.
2022-05-28 18:52:06.075506,VibrationsOfDoom,Pretty solid paddle physics...,"I am a pretty good ping pong player, so far all the robotic opponents haven't given me much trouble. One thing I learned early on is that a very light touch to returning shots is really all that is needed. Whether I play with the front or back side of the paddle it is all supported. The only major detraction is the serving; in real life I never drop the ball on the paddle and serve that way; I always hold the ball close to the paddle and serve, which has varied results. Serving is still incredibly difficult and even the lightest touch sends the ball over the table. Fortunately, the higher leveled opponents return the ball anyway, which almost makes that a moot point. 

Still, the opponents are incredibly easy; the first few cannot return more than a shot or two. However, by level 17 or 18, they are all holding their own somewhat well. Unfortunately, even the higher leveled characters cannot return high bounce shots, but I usually try to keep those to a minimum for a more ""honorable"" gaming experience.  Haven't done the ""superhero"" mode, because I'm having too much fun with the regular version!

One caveat: after playing the game with the lightest of touch with the paddles, I decided to experiment and slam the ball really hard. Seems that the ball doesn't fly away like it SHOULD, the negative comments forced the designers to ""get unreal"" so that when you smash the hell out of the ball with force, it won't fly away at a great distance. Seems to me like the update made realistic settings a bit too unrealistic. Still, as I always play with a light touch, this isn't REALLY an issue for me, it's just an oddity that I find strange. People obviously don't get that you don't NEED much of a force to return a ball being hit towards you at fast speeds. If the developers would go back to things the way they were, it would be more realistic I think. Much fun! One thing the developers could do; make it so we can move the table closer to us.","Mar 3, 2019 at 3:06 AM",4, 5,Thank you so much!
2022-05-28 18:52:09.190176,Randy747,Recent update isn't working well,"Hello,
   I started this game again today, and I find that it is suddenly very difficult to control where the ball is going.  Serving is much more difficult than it used to be, with the ball going off to the side or behind me as often as it moves ahead.  Also, returning the ball sometimes sends it straight up almost 30 feet, even when returned very softly.  Something happened with the physics in the last update.  Four stars again once the ball begins to behave.

Thanks,
Randy","Feb 25, 2019 at 7:09 AM",3, 4,Thank You for your review.
2022-05-28 18:52:09.205135,kir1t0,terrible game,at least to get started is stupid. no instructions on how to play. the tutorial doesnt explain how to play. it says nothing but what buttons to push to activate abilities. i just want to play the game but im furious after 10 minutes. jump in the game and play. no matter what side of the table i hit the ball to on the first shot the opponent gets a point. i dont understand. you cant hit the ball hard because it just goes way out. the table is too low with no way to adjust. i really like playing in real life so was excited to see this in VR but was terribly disappointed.,"Jun 13, 2018 at 7:47 AM",1, 7,"Thank You for your review.

Didn't manage to play with anybody anyway. This is probably the first game in the store I'm gonna try and get my money back for.","May 27, 2018 at 1:13 AM",1, 1,"Thank You for your review.

I just can't stop. Graphics are wonderful....nice rooms to play in. I need to play some more to get all the avatars, but I'm very curious as to how they play. I love the music which is being used here!  I applaud the developer for working on and tweaking the game to this quality. The game is fun, and the players are fun too ;)
p.s. and i can play to my friend with GEARVR! ^-^","Jun 15, 2018 at 2:15 PM",5, 2,Thank you so much!
