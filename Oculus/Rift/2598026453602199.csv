There are leaderboards to keep you trying to beat the guy just a few points ahead of you! and of course just gliding around is fun, intuitive and very majestic. The games also gotta really nice, chill soundtrack too!","Jul 16, 2020 at 1:09 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:22:27.422056,evilStimpVR,I love this game! Exhilarating.,"My secret VR addiction. I always begin and end a VR session with a few rounds of Glider Island. The dev has done sterling work creating a vertigo-inducing thrill ride that keeps the adrenaline pumping, but then it all becomes serene once you get into the flow of flight and all feelings of vertigo disappear as you soar over some very pretty landscapes.

The online leader board is great fun too and the competition keeps me coming back for more.

This plays so good now that it's on the Oculus Store, compared to previously having to load up via Steam, so makes it so much easier to get in for a few quick spins.","Jun 28, 2019 at 6:11 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 19:22:27.436019,TomCgcmfc,Problem with touch controllers -Fixed!,"Fantastic hang gliding game.  Works much better/smoother than the Steam version imho.  Unfortunately after running it again later today I got the same left drifting problem I got with the Steam version.  I needed to hold either grip button to centre the view. 

UPDATE; I found the problem was that my HOTAS was causing interference.  Once I unplugged it from its usb port and restarted this game, all works fine.  This is the first VR game/sim that I have ever needed to do this but at least it now works fine.","Jun 27, 2019 at 9:07 PM",5, 7,
