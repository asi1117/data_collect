2022-05-28 19:34:09.075615,Nonebetter,Simple but good - shoot all the blobs,"Yes the game is simple, but still fun. you point/hold and shoot, and have a shield for defense.

I love it, its very frantic at times, but its pretty fun to try and get good and efficient at it, I go back and playt whenever I was to chill and play something simple.
It has a lot of levels and some variety, 

yes its very simple, but you get what you pay for haha. (was free for me)","Mar 26, 2019 at 7:43 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:34:09.090574,pathmakerjen,Simplistic boring arcade shooter,"You stand in the center and fire a gun at targets around the periphery.  If you’re too slow, they rush you. Yawn.  Boring.  No change to the battle area (just color changes), and the staff and shield actually behave as a gun and shield.  You can upgrade your health and damage but can’t really see its effects.","Jan 18, 2019 at 10:12 AM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 19:34:09.105534,beccaberri,I enjoy it,"I mean, it's no Robo Recall but hey, it's free. It's basically a wave shooter where you have a magical staff that shoots plasma balls, and a shield in your other hand for defense. I use the shield a lot because I like to charge up a power shot and kill 2-3 baddies when they rush me. It's just clean, simple fun and it's free so you have nothing to lose by trying it out. It's not going to keep you occupied for weeks, but it's faily entertaining for a few hours.","Aug 15, 2018 at 5:22 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 19:34:09.120494,CptSabre,Cant even start the game,"Really? An entitlement issue? I thought Oculus got through this problem. I don't even want to bother fixing this because of the reviews on this game. Waste of space, rest in peace.","Apr 11, 2018 at 8:16 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 19:34:12.227220,HeyJesseAe,Average,Simple wave based shooter. Environment changes based on in-game seasons. Surprisingly well done models.,"Jan 21, 2018 at 10:30 AM",3, 3,

2022-05-28 19:34:12.258137,valdark2,,It's not bad but it's also not spectacular.   The kids got a kick out of it but I wouldn't recommend it for adult users due to the lack of challenging gameplay.,"Aug 21, 2017 at 9:54 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 19:34:12.273097,BluePlayer,Point and click against meatballs?!,"Ok so here is the game:
You hold a wand and a shield, the wand is pretty much a laser gun you shoot with the shield bumps the meatballs away

you can charge your laser but that's pointless because just shooting quickly is way more damage and accuracy isn't really great in this one so might as well just rapid fire, you can upgrade your damage which I didn't see do anything at all and I cranked it to level 13... you can increase your health but I tried really hard dying and nothing seemed to happen so I guess you don't really have any healthbar, anyway you point at 3-5 meatballs that can't harm you, and you click to shoot and when you hit them a couple of times (literally.. always 2... ) they die, yay.
They change colors between stages but then they start cycling, every 6? stages something like that there is an ice boss meatball, he also dies really quick but... at least his levels are quick..?

That's it, that's the game.
Want a way better version? Rick and Morty got a shooter mini game in it, it's way better, not the entire rick and morty game no no no, the tiny  little mini game within it is infinitely better than this.

Someone opened unity, figured how to to make enemies spawn and decided to call it a day, there is nothing else in here.","Jun 3, 2017 at 2:55 AM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 19:34:12.288057,DBPops,Not bad,game was ok. it was free so that helps. I've paid for some that were worst.,"Jun 15, 2017 at 10:18 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 19:34:15.395335,theawesometheory,This is very unfinished,"I get that it's free, but there is no reason for this to be on the store as it is clearly an unfinished experience. 

* You cannot get hurt yet there are health upgrades, no way to die or 'loose'

 * Every enemy is the same mesh

* Shield does absolutely nothing

* The world scale is so large that everything appears monoscopic

* Enemies 'attack' by flying into you and staying there, forcing the users vision to clip into them. (half of your head stuck inside an enemy half out)

This app is like a terrible gam jam entry that doesn't win anything because it isn't even a game.","Mar 18, 2017 at 3:59 PM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 19:34:15.410295,neuro27,Wave Shooter for Toddlers,"This app has potential for being a good app to introduce VR for little kids. It's limited depth and cartoonish visuals have little appeal for an older audience that has free access to Robo Recall. However, the marketing currently is against the target audience that the app would most likely appeal to, using profanity in the app description. I would like to see the developers redirect the marketing of the app to match who it appeals to the most - little kids (5 years - 10 years).","Mar 6, 2017 at 3:08 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 19:34:15.425255,Traxxas1,A Good Idea,"The base is pretty solid, it feels cool to shoot stuff as a wizard and I think this game does a good job of showing that. On the other hand its very repetative, sometimes the shots dont register, it doesnt seem like you actually have health even though you can upgrade it?? Id say its a fun 20-30 minute experience to get you hyped for things like skyrim on oculus one day.","Mar 5, 2017 at 8:44 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 19:34:15.441212,elijahjns,3 Because It's Free,I think you should try this game if you can.  It's not very good but it is free.  It's not bad for a minute but then you get tired of it quickly.,"Mar 25, 2017 at 9:20 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:34:15.456172,vernes,small child's intro to oculus touch,"Game play is stupendously simple, graphic meh, it's.... it's nice if you need a low effort intro about Oculus Touch.  
Don't use this if you want to blow people's minds about VR.","Mar 11, 2017 at 11:02 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:34:18.559997,thorgan,I missed the point,"I feel like someone tried to make a game here but honestly, it feels so unpolished I didn't actually knew what to do beside randomly shooting at things.","Mar 20, 2017 at 12:05 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 19:34:18.576952,cdroulers,Not bad. At least it's free,Games mechanics are good but there is not enough content.,"Mar 28, 2017 at 8:59 AM",3, 0,
