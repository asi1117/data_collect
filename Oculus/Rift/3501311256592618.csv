The game doesn't save your progress after each level, only at the end of the world. If you restart the game, you restart whatever world you were last in (even if you'd made it to level 5 of that world).

Worlds:
- I found the intro world to be about what you'd want from an intro. It's fine.
- The 2nd world is really interesting, right from the beginning, with the quirky little log creature who seems like a pest, but can sometimes help you. I really enjoyed this and it made me look forward to more of the game.
- The 3rd world seems like a bit of let down at first... until it became amazing. I almost quit before the snowman showed up, because the scenery didn't really change, the levels were long, and the music (which you cannot shut off) looped too quickly and became maddeningly repetitive. But then, just when I was going to quit, the little snowman appeared, and the last two levels took all the delight of the 2nd/Halloween world and amplified it! Suddenly the setting was more interesting, charming, and well-integrated into the game mechanic. Maybe this was more impactful simply because it was a surprise and not that way all along.
- I was able to finish the 4th world, but it was stressful and not fun. Perhaps more water or a more generous timer on the portal levels should be considered. 

The earthquakes and all end of level animations were hard to watch and felt inconsistent with a 'Comfortable' rating.

The game's ending was beautiful, adorable, and memorable. Thank you. Glad I got the chance to linger before 'waking up' (it would be nice to add a button like that for each world ending, too).

Hope to see a sequel with additional interesting characters. (Tooth fairy? Leprechaun? Easter bunny? New Year's dragon? A trickster fox? Lots of possibilities!)","May 24, 2021 at 5:58 AM",5, 3,

My Initial Impressions:
As a fan of pancake match 3 games I was not holding out much hope for this game, but I was pleasantly surprised! 
The developers have added new mechanics and features to this already popular genre, and I have to commend them for that!","May 12, 2021 at 1:35 AM",4, 4,
