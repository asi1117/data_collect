- It does not have a colorblind more as far as I know.
- I haven't figured out the scoring yet. No idea how it works.
On some levels, you get a time bonus for completing a level early. It's rather small. On other levels, the red orbs turn into positive orbs. That's easy. But there doubles (is it a double if you hit 2 different colors at the same time?!) and you can raise your combo ratio while targeting similar orbs. I have no idea if it's better to first double shot 1 color, then the next etc. and let the time run out or if you can easily change colors and still get a good score. What about accuracy? Is it hit/miss or are there aim zones?
- Some levels feature hidden orbs. I have had trouble finding all of them. I do wonder: Do they only appear when a certain condition is met? I. e. hitting certain balls? Or am I simply blind and I have to look more accurately?

Overall this game runs smooth and i had a lot of fun playing the game.","Oct 3, 2020 at 10:08 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:58:38.792698,goesBang,Great small game,"You collect orbs by shooting at them. The differently colored orbs are swirling in fantastic and complex patterns (depends on level difficulty) with proper background music.
The colored orbs come in pairs, hitting pairs gives more points and increases combo counter etc. Then we have forbidden orbs that give negative points or decrease combo counter etc. The balance is, to hit pairs without hitting the forbidden orbs - use small gaps for high rewards or fail...
It's a simple principle but it feels very polished and the level designs are fantastic.
The leader board works really well and is an important part of the game - just get into the top 10 or 20 for this level and for that - you can spend hours with this.
Also different mode, flying through orbs, rotating orb constructions by yourself etc.
It's a simple / small game - conceptually. But there are so many levels and modes - it's not so small after all. Very relaxing.","Jul 22, 2020 at 1:15 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:58:38.806660,PsychedelicKarma,Amazingly ADDICTIVE Relaxing Brilliance!,"This game took me by suprise, I had no clue what i was buying into but i have had hours of endless fun for such a small price! The game does not feel unfinished nor does it have bugs! it runs very smooth and the gameplay is perfect & original i mean me and my girlfrined just keep trying to beat each others scores and have now become GODS! and its SO satisifying to complete a level without making a mistake or just hitting the double shots risking the tiniest gap hoping not to lose your combo! Never mind it has loads of game modes with working leaderboreds giving it that competitive edge.  Its also relaxing. This game is just simply fantastic. Well worth grabbing! Glad my curiosity got the better of me on this one.","Jul 16, 2020 at 2:45 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:58:38.820623,Zef_Oakleaf,Can't overstate the great!,This game is nowhere near as popular as it deserves to be!  It's compelling in its polish and game mechanics.  Leaderboards give that competitive twist for all so inclined.  Fun for a quick few rounds but then it draws the player in and the time evaporates into an overall great experience.  I knew after the tutorial ended and my first level started that it would be a sure favorite and so far it's the game I've come back to the most in my whole VR library.  It's very easy to play but skill and familiarity are met with more elusive goals within tons of levels.  Get. This. Game.,"Jun 21, 2020 at 3:07 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:58:38.835583,EvilFlow,I’m glad I pulled the trigger on this,"Good arcade game. Good leaderboards. Fun game I will continue to go back to.

Devs: please add controller config. Finger gets sore after awhile pulling trigger so many times. Would be nice to have option to just press a button with thumb instead. Thanks","Jun 27, 2020 at 2:24 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:58:41.959228,jdiviant,A physics masterpiece!,This is one of the most beautiful games that I have played and it has been an absolute joy to have access to so many levels! I would rate the replay value as being very high!,"Jun 19, 2020 at 11:45 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:58:41.973191,Creepyz.76,Wow,Gotta be one of the most immersive games I've played. advice.....stand up it's much better,"Apr 6, 2020 at 8:28 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:58:41.988151,Clickingtoenails,Get this game! It is surreal!,"I keep going back to this to try to improve my scores. Most often I do worse than before. LOL. But the point is, I keep going back. The scenes are amazing, the music is relaxing, and the challenge is good with a lot of different levels and modes to choose from.  Also, play standing up. It is a trip!","Jan 19, 2020 at 10:54 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 20:58:42.004108,fayewray71,So Much Fun,"This game is great because it is challenging, but not too frustrating, and fun to sit back after a day of work.  There are levels not too hard, and some really hard!!  Great game, well worth it!","Nov 23, 2019 at 10:11 AM",5, 7,
