2022-05-28 15:00:29.431432,Sarxis,Pretty Good Story,But quite a dark story.  The voice acting is SUPERB!  The story itself is post-apocalyptic.  Seeing everything in VR makes it better.,"Dec 27, 2019 at 6:42 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:00:29.447389,StormyDoesVR,A Display of Unreal Storytelling,"This was absolutely incredible, and worth every penny I paid for it. I had heard the premise of the Great C before, when it first came out, but since it was an immersive short film, and not a game, it took me a while to purchase it. Man am I glad I finally did. the story is so compelling, sombering, and mysterious, I just can't get enough of it!

Now, when can we get an action-adventure/rpg retelling of this? Like, in the same art style, just with the mc's crafting crude weapons as they progress towards the Great C, and then several boss fights thrown in there intermittently? The story, and the animation, is so worthy of a game adaptation, it would be gorgeous and thrilling! Quite like Chronos VR, but with more of a sci-fi spin.

Anyway, the only gripe I have is that I feel like not enough time was spent on the character's emotions for this short, especially in close ups it can seem like only their eyes show emotion, but the mouths and eyebrows don't move a lot, and sometimes the emotions they do show are mismatched. (For instance SPOILER: in the scene after Tim's second straying, Clare finds the gun and looks straight at the camera, which is usually where we'd either see her eyes flicker with rage, her face contorting in anger as she plots revenge against the C, or a firm seriousness as she concretes her path to report. Instead, her eyes looked slightly irritated at best, and her teeth weren't bared, something very easy to do to show anger in a character.

However, in more pulled out scenes, such as the bird eye view scenes, or scenes where the camera is pulled back to allow room for tim and clare both to have ample screen room, the character animation seems to have much more life and emotion (although at points it is still a bit choppy, mostly in arm movements that seem to lack follow through in some scenes)

But all in all, this was a serious joy to watch! Now please give me an action-adventure game based on this, stat!","Oct 25, 2019 at 11:15 AM",5, 6,

The design and and animation of the 3D world created by these artists is top notch and well worth the low price. I'm really looking forward to more stories told in this format as it is involving in a way 2D can't compare with.  So bottom line when you want to relax from gaming a bit this story is a fantastic way to kick back and enjoy a great tale.

VR movies are incredibly hard to execute.
There are many factors that you need to take in account or else things will collapse quickly.

 There are several (minor) issues with this movie, but It's not too big to distract you from further watching.

2022-05-28 15:00:32.617910,tommosaur,Nice story excellently told,"I liked the whole plot and the presentation was all around on highest level. The modeling, texturing, character and effects animation, whole environment, sfx, voice acting and music, all to the UI and everything, all around great work. I'd love to see way more stories in this format. The characters were charming and there was an emotional touching connection there throughout which made one feel for the people. 
At first i was not fully sure about how to feel that in longer distance/wide angle shots etc it felt more like a diorama than as if the characters and world were in real world human scale (, it feels like real world scale in closeups), but over time i really liked that a lot, too, because in the closeups they feel more real human like which enhances the  feel of being in a real world with real characters and so that also enhances the connection with them and the environment, while the distant diorama feel causing shots not just let one see more of the world and also make the characters feel much cuter and adorable so one then for that reason feels more for them, too, but also then in a very physical believable feeling way it enhances the feeling of how small and lost they feel in this big dark cold uninviting world, which fits very well with the whole story. 
That actually enhances the feelings to be conveyed in the story in a very physical feeling way in the presentation which one would never feel if it wasn't in VR.

2022-05-28 15:00:35.807379,Dropla,The Raddest movie on Oculus!!,"This was SO RAD! It was definitly worth the tiny price tag! Honestly, im not sure why it wasn't more!! I was not expecting this to be anywhere near this good! Like, pinhead and cthulhu had a baby and they live in fallout 4! I will be watching this many times, I will have to try watching at 4:20 ^.~

 Also, some people are complaining about the scale changing, I think that is kind of strange, because, when you watch TV and movies, the scale changes all the time as does the angle lol, not really understanding that gripe. Someone literally said ""Why can't it stay still like normal cameras in movies. Cameras in movies don't ever stay in the same position, angle or distance the whole  movie. Like never. xD In fact, there were many times, when I was watching over while they were smaller scale that I was really happy that I could take more in view, it made it so much better in my opinion!

 Also ~ those talking about a price difference on steam, that's most likely because of a currency exchange price being representedon steam, but, the proce is represented in only here. The price was the same on both platforms for me.

 I am seriously pained thinking I will have to wait for the next, I wish I could buy like weekly or monthly episodes of this!!","Nov 6, 2018 at 12:27 AM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 15:00:35.823336,Plurr,Good VR film,"This is a VR cinematic of fair quality. It's not up there with Henry or The Invisible Hours, but it's adequate. At about half an hour long, it's among the longest VR films to date, which is very welcome.

One thing I didn't quite care for was the shifts in size and me ""sticking out of the ground"". I think one needs to be less creative with the cinematography in VR compared to in traditional cinema.

A previous reviewer said the Oculus store is more expensive than Steam, but at least for me they use different currencies. On Steam this was €4.99. On Oculus it was $5.99, which is €5.21. So it seems close enough.","Oct 10, 2018 at 10:35 PM",4, 24,
2022-05-28 15:00:38.916064,Popcorntech,An Absolute Masterpiece,"I have now viewed this tale many times and I just can't get over how amazing The Great C is. THIS is where I thought VR would go when I first read the Oculus kickstarter. We follow Clair, daughter of the chief. The chief was forced into obedience by The Great C at a young age, watching everyone he knew slaughtered before his eyes. The Great C demands compliance.

Then, right when we are getting settled in and attached to our main characters, a hearbreaking turn of events unfolds. That's just the setup and I don't want to spoil this, but I have spent a lot of time studying science fiction. The dystopia that the experience displays is straight from what I have pictured in various novels. It's like it was just plucked straight from the imagination and fully realized in a beautiful environment. 

I tried to come up with a criticism to make this review less fanboyish, but I really can't think of a single thing wrong with this. Some have commented that the various scale changes is jarring, but I actually really dig it. It keeps the experience  feeling fresh throughout. 

The subtle facial animations really added to it for me. It was obvious what the characters were feeling even when they weren't speaking. These rendered characters are acting circles around what I could do in real life. 

I will never, ever, forget that I had this experience. It's that good. Please, please make more. I don't know how you achieved this, but keep doing it.","Oct 25, 2018 at 11:13 AM",5, 5,

The story is very straight-forward - and feels as if it's written by young adults who are yet to gain more life experience and wisdom. Maybe this movie is great if you're 15 to 30 years old, but probably not that great if you're 40+, but I like to support new ideas and to experience new methods of communicating stories to a wide audience. The movie is like a 30 min realtime rendered game intro, it worked flawlessly using super sampling 2.0 on my oc'ed GTX 1080 and i7 7700K.

I guess they must have been inspired by Fallout at times. The scenery was like taken right out of Fallout 4. What I didn't like was the constant changing of scale. Sometimes they made the people like ants, and the background did not change scale. It felt weird and the changing was way to often for my taste. Also some weird camera angles at times.

To me it even breaks the immersion - i feel like i am a camera instead of an observer. 2 Constant camera movement and weird angles: This is why I strongly recommend the version without it. Like in normal film, there is no reason in VR to move the camera all the time. Also, sudden positional changes like facing down does not work well in VR, other than producing instant motion sickness for some people. 3 No subtitles.

2022-05-28 15:00:48.385736,Mutant-VR,"£4.49 on Oculus Store, £4.79 on Steam","Superb as one of the first VR films. Easily can to be watched at least twice. 1st time with more focus on the story and generally facing the front, 2nd time following the story again but paying more attention to the environment, looking around, looking behind you, etc., because graphically it is also superb. Great soundtrack too. I hope more people give VR films a try, and not just stick to gaming. VR films have a lot to offer. The more people purchase VR film content, the more & bigger VR films we will get. This VR film is a great example of what is possible.

Also someone was complaining Oculus Store is usually more expensive than Steam including this title? That's a totally wrong statement, wrong not just for now but for a long time too. I've had VR since summer 2017 and Oculus Store prices are generally & mostly always cheaper than Steam (in past Oculus gave even more deep discounts on titles than Steam ever has during sales). This misconception arose, as someone else has also confirmed, because that guy who complained has one currency for Steam (Euros) and another for Oculus Store (Dollar). So quite foolish of him to not convert the currency, & instead take the absolute figure as is. Even more sad is that so many people have marked his comment as helpful without verifying it first.

This one sets a high standard and I'd happily pay AU $20 for an hour and a half movie just like this, and I'm sure a lot of people would.  For those whining about the price, get a grip, it's a large coffee ffs..

If you like any of the following:  VR, short stories, Sci-fi, then you should pick this up for sure.  It's polished, looks great, has AWESOME sound design and music (Junkie XL) with an 80's neo noir synth thing going on that I love.

Trying not to sound like an advert here but I can't fault it.  +1

2022-05-28 15:00:54.723784,FunkyLasagne,Great stuff,"Good film.  Interesting story.  It is similar to the original short stidy with some important differences to make it its own thing - more ""inspired by"" rather than a film of.  Scale is a little small for my liking (I prefer life-size), but I can see why the makers made the decisions they did.  Some small technical issues towards the end - lip synch for one of the characters (and only one funnily enough) is out, but it doesnt detract too much.  Overall I really enjoyed it and at a fiver it is excellent value.","Oct 11, 2018 at 3:20 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:00:54.738744,nickladd,Worth Checking out,"I don't believe that this film has played to the strengths of the VR medium. I think it's an interesting short with a good production quality. But as a ""VR film"" it doesn't offer much that you wouldn't get watching it flat screen.

This is treated more like a regular film than any other VR film I've seen with hard cuts, changing angles, pans, etc. It doesn't usually work that well because it either makes the viewer feel a bit queasy, confused after a huge scale change  or disoriented. Other than taking in the environment there is little incentive to look around. The action is usually directly in front of the viewer. I felt more like I was a camera and not immersed in the world.

There is one shot I did really like where the two main characters climbed up a building each taking a different route. This was interesting because there were few cuts during this sequence allowing you to follow either of the protagonists. This can make for interesting VR storytelling and encourages rewatches to see areas you might have missed. I wish more of the film had been shot this way.

It's not expensive and if you're curious I'd say it's worth checking out.","Oct 11, 2018 at 9:25 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 15:00:57.843440,HurricaneZulu,Rated G for everyone,"A little boring, story is OK, not going to be as exciting as PG13 block buster. A kid would probably enjoy this, at this no ""thrill"" level.","Nov 28, 2018 at 10:42 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 15:00:57.859397,Anomalous2141,Marvelous Tech | Not So Great Story,"I'm breaking this review into two categories because the technology is still new:

The Tech: This is gorgeous to look at, and the way the story is told sets a gold standard future story-driven VR cinema should aim for.  Other people mentioned the shifting scale; I noticed it too, but assumed it was for resource management.  If there was another intended effect I didn't see it, but it didn't bother me much.  The world this story creates is fantastic to experience and I look forward to future VR films that put you in the world.  Bravo!

The Story Itself: I just wish the shiny wrapping paper disguised a better gift.  The story was dark, dreary, depressing: I did not enjoy it at all.  Not sure why this story was chosen or even what the takeaway is supposed to be.  It felt like reading a bad community college short story in beginner fiction.  I realize it's based on a story by Philip K [LAST NAME REDACTED; OCULUS THINKS IT'S PROFANITY].  I think the guy was phoning it in that day.  Call me crazy but I like to enjoy the movies I'm watching.  Still, I'm sure others enjoy a darker experience more than I do, and the pricetag is perfect if a little on the cheap side to be honest.  I was tempted to give this a three-star review because I hated, hated, hated the story, but what the heck: it was worth every penny.  All five hundred of 'em.","Oct 23, 2018 at 12:59 PM",5, 0,

Always just shoots me out to my home screen. Paid $5.99 for a frustrating afternoon instead of a 30 minute joy filled video.  :(","Oct 24, 2018 at 1:54 AM",1, 1,"Hi Mandroid0, we're really sorry to hear you're having issues with The Great C.

2022-05-28 15:00:57.891312,Lotom,Amazing VR Movie,"I am so glad they released this to the stores and didn't keep it just for the film festivals. This is a really good experience, especially with full cinema mode enabled.","Oct 10, 2018 at 3:03 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:00:57.906272,vdwtanner,Very cool experience!,"It was really neat to see an animated film in full 3D, and I must say that I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the art and the amount of realtime lighting! I think I only had one or two hitches on my GTX 970, so hella props to the team! My only complaint with the experience was that towards the end the voices got out of sync with the mouth animations. Other than that it was really great though :) I watched it in the cinematic camera mode without getting any VR sickness, but if you are really prone to it they have a version that is supposed to reduce the chance of feeling ill.
