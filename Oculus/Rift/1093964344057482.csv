I did go back to see if I could score higher by completing each scenario with a faster time. Adding the stress of trying to do the run faster didn't enhance the fun factor, it just added stress. Also, the maps are far too similar. I had no problem with the controls, they worked well for me. I do feel that I got value for what I paid. There just isn't enough to bring me back. There are many more games that will occupy my time. It's a solid 3 stars for the effort.","Dec 21, 2017 at 5:44 AM",3, 6,
