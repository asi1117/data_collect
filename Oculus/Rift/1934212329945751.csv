Firstly, the Settings menu is bareboned, and the Music can only be enabled or disabled. I’d like to see a volume control for the music, ambient noise and the narrator.

Second, the controls to rotate the puzzles are counter-intuitive, and would like to see an invert rotation axis in the Options. It’s been very difficult to rotate the puzzles because they keep turning in the direction opposite of what I thought they should be.

Lastly, a few more speed options on the boat, as going at top speed, doesn’t make for a very relaxing game. You get around quickly, but it’s very jarring to go from a dead stop to what feels like a boat race. A slower, cruising speed would be most welcoming.","Jun 5, 2020 at 6:11 AM",3, 2,

Can be quite a tough puzzler, you can just drive the boat around too, however can you please tell me how the hell to get into the settings menu as music is crazy loud and voices are crazy quiet I can barely tell what hes saying also boat seems to be able to go breakneck speed or stopped, hardly relaxing!   Rotation puzzles are a joy to beat, giving you some great 'oh my gosh' moments!  Just give me the settings menu and you can have a star or 2 more. (can see a settings tab in the book that I cant get to : S)","Nov 7, 2018 at 7:56 PM",3, 6,
