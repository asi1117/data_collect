2022-05-28 17:22:59.567956,apelio,Amazing.  I would pay for a full version,This is amazing.  I wish somebody made a full version game like this.  The 3D captured actors looked really good too.  I've never seen that in any other game.  I love futuristic cities.  It would be my dream if someone made an open world futuristic city RPG like this.

2022-05-28 17:22:59.581919,TBirdo01,Fun but very short,"I found this an entertaining experience.  The visuals are pretty good, and it has an interesting concept.

2022-05-28 17:23:02.678636,Rob_Milliken,A must for any Bladerunner fan!,"There is a recognizable character, in game, that has to be based on the looks of Philip K. Dlck. He originally wrote ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sleep"" which Bladerunner was based on. The infomat said the character is 52. PK Dlck died at age 53. Chills.
This short game is too popular -too good- to just be left the way it is, lost - like tears in the rain. It has to return in some form. From the perfectly recreated Spinner (air car) flying in the rain to the holographic like guide that helps you during the game, you'll be agape through this entire adventure.",Aug 19 at 2:21 PM,5, 5,

There was also a Part 3 planned, according to VRfocus.com:
""Created by Turtle Rock Studios, this is actually the first of three Blade Runner VR experiences with two more due to be released prior to Blade Runner 2049’s release later this year. These will be coming to both Gear VR and Oculus Rift.""

So right off that bat, I kinda knew and felt there wasn't much to this app, and I was right.

It always pretty good, but I wish there was more to it.

2022-05-28 17:23:15.320823,Gabriel_Prime,Interesting presentation.,"This short demo displays some impressive technology. It would seem far more impressive with free movement—and the teleportation does GREATLY hinder the experience—but I was still more struck by the immersive possibilities of the mixed reality capture technology for the characters. Far too many Oculus games come in at a paltry few gigs, and it really shows in the detail and presentation. I believe much of the VR community is hungry for a huge game of deeply immersive detail and content and are more than willing to take the hit on their hard drives and bank accounts. Like many, I’m fed up with the cartoony nonsense pushed on the VR community. Unreal 4, paired with mixed reality capture and free movement, seems already poised to create a next gen experience.","Jul 17, 2019 at 6:12 AM",5, 9,

2022-05-28 17:23:18.457434,below_light,"Stunning, but short","This exploratory experience (it really is more of an experience than a game, as such) is visually astounding, making use of some brilliant motion capture and some awesome looking graphics that make use of the BR2049 world. However, it's just far too short - it feels like it should be perhaps a 'first episode' or a teaser for a full title, and it ends rapidly without much of an explanation for the whole thing, and a rushed effort to tie the events you're investingating together. My only other criticism is the method of locomotion - I really hate teleportation, it's such an un-natural way of moving about and it feels like the one thing that really breaks the illusion of this otherwise 10/10 VR experience. That aside, I very much hope the creators of this release a stack more in the same style!! An hour or two worth of this format would easily justify a £15-20 game. But for free, you can't fault this one. Five stars for sure. Thanks to the devs!","May 6, 2019 at 12:45 AM",5, 9,

2022-05-28 17:23:21.659868,Satconcook,True 3D live capture,"Absolutely loved the volumetric live capture for this short but great example of what VR can be. Unlike many other VR shorts that have live capture, you can actually walk around these characters and I feel that added even more to the environment. Having options for locomotion would be a great addition, but the rotate in teleport worked well. If something like this can be turned into a full blown game it would be amazing.","May 29, 2019 at 10:26 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:23:21.674828,Gordon_Freeman,Best VR game ever but too short,I understand how hard it is to make VR games but this really needs to be longer. The second I stepped in it was like I was in the memory lab and the whole use of mocap is amazing. When I got to the ending I though we were just getting started but then the credits started rolling and I was very dissapointed but in a good way. They game and its story is amazing but thinking the game was just getting started then having it end was a let down.

2022-05-28 17:23:24.814431,Stone240cold,One of the best ever.,"The producers have really put together a top notch game, truly worthy of the Blade Runner name.  Better than the Blade Runner remake movie.  At certain points in the game I felt like I was there, right there on the street.  I wanted to just stretch my arms out and feel the space.  The game was easy and well guided, no frustration what so ever.  Also with room scale you could kind of walk around outside of the limits of set game parameters.  You could touch and examine people and things, just not interact with them.  All they need to do now is take this one step further with more interactivity and they could reach a whole new level of vr gaming.","Mar 7, 2019 at 10:18 PM",5, 6,

One of the tricky things for our poor actors is that capturing them with volumetric video requires putting them in a green room and surrounding them with 100+ cameras.  And we captured them before we had the environments or the story fully developed so that wasn't helping them.  We think we can help the actors more in the future and our subsequent work with volumetric video has been more successful in this regard.

2022-05-28 17:23:37.457615,ricardus,Impressive,"Reading the other reviews I'm slightly confused as to the reasons some only gave it 1 or 2 stars. This is quite exceptional, the character modelling/animation is top notch, probably the best I've encountered in VR to date. The setting is also interesting, albight a tease. I'd really like this to be made into a full game, I'd definately buy it.

The story approach is short, yes, but again I took it as a teaser, not a statement. It tells me a lot about what these developers are capable of and I know if they took it further into something bigger, they'd do an excellent job as it's quite impressive. Whether they will or not (as such a thing is a big undertaking) is unknown, but I really hope they do.

If I moved a little bit to the side the woman would not stare straight at me anymore. This took me out of the experience and I was no longer there. I was just an observer. So, IMO, using 3d scanned humans as npc's is not the way to go in interactive experiences, for now.  I think getting eye contact is really important. I mean, I felt more immersed in half life when it came out. The characters feel more real there and that game is what, 10+ years old? Sheesh. So no, the tech isn't there yet. Scanning a human in 3d and putting them in your game/experience is not enough to make them feel human. To make them feel human you have to make them interact with the player, have eye contact and what have you. Making them have eye contact while you stand still like a stiff pole doesn't count. This might still work for movie like experiences where the ""player"" is an observer but not for interactive experiences like this. And on a sidenote, I felt more immersed in Aircar than in this.

Technically, it provides an amazing detail of the environment and of the graphics, surely done by using several strategies (like the lower polygon actor model which looks great) to achieve this. It advances into something you start thinking this is gonna be a full game, with a great and interesting interface. But then, it finishes when it reveals a great secret and you expect some more to come, not to finish right that moment. At that point it can be easily continued into a real game, after everything it already provided.

To me this was a great proof of concept. There are game mechanic gripes and some polish needed for this to actually be a game worth money but for what it was it was cool.

From a gameplay mechanic standpoint the only thing I would say they need to add for this type of game to be successfull is at least an option for free roam via the thumb stick rather than just point and click. I realize some people need point and click because its less likely to cause motion sickness (or to much for their rig) but its immersion breaking. It feels clunky and annoying as is. 

When the FMV actor looked at you, her eyes followed you pretty well, but there was some lattency if you adjusted your footing to a new postion. When it worked though it was awsome and made me feel like I was in the game.

I would love to see something like this as a murder mystery game...and have to admit while playing this, it made me almost have a flash back of playing a Tex murphy Advanture! Which I thought was awsome...and a bit ironic since it was satire of the oringal blade runner.

2022-05-28 17:24:15.401130,Kevin_Brook,Not up my alley,I guess if you're a fan of the Blade Runner world you will dig this. I found it so dull I didn't even finish. Basically a strangely animated holo woman gets you to wonder around an alleyway and point your laser at static objects to decode them.  Gameplay wise it's the same as Farlands. If you enjoy pointing at things and clicking on static objects to reveal information this will be right up your alley. If you prefer actual gameplay I'd not bother. Apparently this is a short 20 minute experience but it felt like twice as long and I couldn't bring myself to finish. If you're going to download a 10gb file to interact with an attractive hologram female I'd recommend Wankz VR or Badoink as offering a lot more entertainment than this.,"Oct 28, 2017 at 4:26 AM",2, 2,

Then once you actually have to do something the task is mundane and pulls you out of the world. The world is sparse which is understandable given hardware limitations but sound could have been used much more effectively like the film and more interesting static images used. The only reason it gets 3 stars is because it initially pulls you in and give you a bit more of the Blade Runner world fans want. SPOILERS In the ended it leads to a climax of crap with a bad Jared Leto impersonation.

Speaking on behalf of all the developers who have worked so hard to make this a great experience, we didn't cast this woman so you could objectify her.  Being ""hot"" was not ever a design objective, and wouldn't have served the experience.  In return, we're also rating you 1 star as a human being.
Have a nice day!"
2022-05-28 17:25:12.355797,FreelanceMC,I've seen things,"The experience is well done and polished.  It's great to visit a city section as well with all the lights and detail. The scale and human character models look impressive, I think this is how future VR games should handle character modeling.  The over all experience is on the short side and leaves you wanting more. It also leaves you wanting to interact with a lot more things than you can.  I recommend it , even if you aren't a Blade Runner fan like me.  3/5","Nov 13, 2017 at 12:06 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 17:25:12.372751,Spikerama,"""I want more life f@#ker""","Sad to say but I think they have missed a trick here. 

As a massive fan of Blade Runner, when I heard they were making a VR movie tie in for BR 2049 I was jumping with glee in anticipation of playing it. Finally after a few delays I jumped in to explore the Blade Runner universe. What I discovered what a lifeless, souless world, devoid of any of the richness and depth we find in the Blade Runner films we know and love. 

Does it look like Blade Runner? Sort of... the Yukon Hotel is there. The Holo Ballerina from 2049 is dancing above you. Joi is selling herself on an advertising billboard as a few spinners hover past but it just feels so empty and lifeless. I could put it down to a few things but one easy fix would have been sound. They should have filled it with the bustling street sounds of LA 2049 or 2019 and added a few more npcs. 

The other thing is you don't get to fly a spinner except for an ""on rails"" moment at the start. It's not Blade Runner if you can't fly your own spinner. I mean come on!

I do applaud them for making the effort though and giving us a freebie but I would happily pay to have proper Blade Runner experience. This property is so ripe for VR.

Come on Warner Bros, give us what we all want.","Dec 3, 2017 at 1:52 PM",3, 2,
