2022-05-28 20:03:53.718231,Ext3rmin8or,Great concept. Terrible execution,The games concept of combinign a grapple rome swing with combat is awesome. however there is a huge lack of players on the platform and there is a lack of immersion within the game.,Aug 25 at 1:02 PM,3, 2,"Thank you for your feedback! Please check other servers for more players, we have high peaks, and Friday during the tournament is an especially busy time.

2022-05-28 20:03:53.733191,1foggy,Great game!,"This is like playing Quake III Arena, but in VR.  And with web-slinging to add another layer to the movement & dodging.   It's fantastic, even playing with the bots on some of the levels, but it's more fun when there are a lot of people on.  Quite a few levels and game modes.   I can't get my microphone in my Rift S to work in this game, probably something I'm doing wrong within the game (but it works in other games).  I can hear other people talking to each other but they can't hear me.   But yeah, give this game a shot.  There's a learning curve to staying mobile and web-slinging, and leading your targets, but it doesn't take long.","Mar 22, 2021 at 10:26 AM",5, 3,"I'm glad to hear that you enjoyed the game. The microphone is a really important part of this social game, let's fix it! I had that Mic issue before and only Rift S reset (disconnect from USB and HDMA and reconnect) helps. Please, join our Discord, I'll be able to help to troubleshoot the issue: https://discord.gg/BEdWsry"
2022-05-28 20:03:53.748151,masta-yoda,"Grapple everywhere, fun to play!","Lots of different maps, amazing grappling hook works on any surface, it lets you move unpredictably which makes this game really engaging. Pretty dynamic gameplay, rockets, lasers, plasma are all over the place! You can play with bots, but it's an absolute joy to play against (or within a team play) real players. Weekly tournaments and challenges let you stay on top of the leaderboard but I really which to have some progression, customizations, and some unlockable items (custom skins, custom gun models, new levels). Hard to find an opponent from time to time (not a bot). Worth checking out!","Jan 7, 2021 at 4:41 AM",5, 29,"The customization to your player, guns, and effects are in our backlog of features and we are going to work on them pretty soon.

2022-05-28 20:03:53.764108,io-on-fire,Free pvp shooter that goes beyond,"just shooting - a lot of tactics are not shoot-based but movement/jump based.
Thanks for the weekly tournaments, first few were tough, and... then 2nd place :D 
You might need some experience with VR locomotion - there is a tutorial in the game to get you through.

TLDR - try it for yourself and join tournaments and or challenges.","Feb 9, 2021 at 10:44 PM",5, 3,"Glad you enjoyed the game, thank you for being an active member of the Battle Arena community!"

Highly recommended.","Jan 10, 2021 at 10:01 PM",5, 9,"Thanks for giving it a try and we are glad you enjoyed it! Focus on performance and making sure there will be no motion sickness was our goal.

It should be the A button, instead its used to change weapons, and the maps are so undetailed and small, pls do not download this garbage, instead just go buy one like onward or pavlov instead of this load of crap","Mar 29, 2021 at 3:34 PM",1, 0,"Thank you for your feedback and thank you for advertising other games in review dedicated for Battle Arena VR.

2022-05-28 20:04:00.086983,jadfeel,The most shooter hilarious experience,"Why regular shooters are boring while Battle Arena is not? 
I guess I can get the recipe quite accurate. Firstly, you fly. When you can both fly and shoot stuff - that's cool and fun, right? Secondly, you have real players and nice conversations hit the floor from time to time. What could be better than the emotional verbal or not a verbal acknowledgment of the great headshot? Thirdly, playing with people raises nice emotions. Yeap, the crowd is friendly and full of decent human beings, or androids. Who knows? You can choose your character.
All in all, you have lots of guns to play with, along with the grabbles, lots of places to go to, and even a weekly championship! 
So why wait? See you in the game and I'll probably either direblast or rail you, nothing personal =) Pure fun and joy.","Mar 9, 2021 at 1:40 PM",5, 1,"Glad you enjoyed the game, thank you for being an active member of the Battle Arena community!"

2022-05-28 20:04:00.118898,Chillt0n,Quake VR,"This is a good shooter for retro shooter fans with headsets to try something a little different. The game's experience overall is amazing, simple to grasp, and rewarding to master. Weapon balancing could use some work, but so could alot of things

Not a bad title to start off 2021.","Feb 11, 2021 at 4:01 PM",4, 1,"Thank you for the feedback, I'm glad you liked the game experience! Our community helps to balance the guns, we actively discuss the usage, the power, the balance, and testing that balance all the time, including the weekly tournaments. You can think that Dire Blaster is OP but it almost useless against the faster player, you can think that SMG is underpowered but in fact, we had to depower it because people start to abuse it, especially in 1x1 matches.

2022-05-28 20:04:00.134856,Paragon-1307,Very Unfinished Seeming But Has Its Ups,"The Bad: The gunplay doesn't feel very good, the guns have no feel to them whatsoever. For example in games like pavlov you get the feel of firing your gun, with recoil and detailed animation. In this game there is no recoil whatsoever and the guns never change from their base model. The gunplay also seems quite unbalanced, with the spray gun instantly killing enemies and the rocket launcher two hitting people cross map while guns like the smg, which has a literal 5ish second killtime while landing every shot, and the laser sniper-like gun with is a gun you have to pick up not one you start with, kills in about 3 hits and fires slower then the rocket launcher that kills in 2, with the only advantage of being hitscan, in which the rockets are fast anyway. The grip to jump is also strange.

The Good: The grapple mechanic is the staple of the game, its the one redeeming factor. You touch it up a little and makes the guns more balanced and have oomph to them, and you have a pretty good basis for a game. I also feel bad talking down on the game since yall are probably small developers, but think of it as feedback and not criticism.","Jan 17, 2021 at 8:38 PM",3, 2,"Great feedback! Thanks for the amazing details. I've registered main concerns at our feedback forum so people can add details and vote on the feedback items. Please leave your vote too: 

https://battlearenavr.net/feedback

Totally agree on the recoil thing, I'd treat it as a not completed feature and added to the backlog to work on it later. For the gunplay balance, I've already had 3-4 iterations of balancing the guns and it's all based on the players' feedback and tournaments results, which shows which guns are over or underpowered, the rocket deals more damage because it's harder to land than a laser, also it deals just partial damage if you land an indirect hit. And even with slower recharge, you can land more kills with a laser gun if it's in hands of a skilled player, eventually you will need to pick rocket and rail too, once we add a starter gun. The laser guns kill from 3 kills and not 2 (deals 45% of damage) just because when it did >50% you will die from a single headshot and it's not that hard to land a headshot from that gun. If a skilled person takes this gun, with a single headshop you wouldn't move across the map at all, thus we depowered it.  Spray (plasma thrower) is just for close combat and skilled people won't let you get close with it, which makes it very interesting to hit each other with that in close combat somewhere mid-air.

Please join our Friday event, a tournament, to see why these guns are balanced in this way, complemented by the grappling hook. It's about 30-60 mins long, staring at 7 PM ET, sign up in the game lobby. Thank you!"
2022-05-28 20:04:00.151810,DoppGanger,Really fun!,"Wanna swing around like spider man and shoot people with guns in multiple different game modes? This game is for you! Graphics although simplistic it has a charm to it, which brings me to wonder why they have not released this on the quest as the graphics aren’t demanding. Hopefully there is a quest version in the near future, try it! It’s free, what do you have to lose?","Jan 12, 2021 at 4:26 AM",5, 2,"Thank you for your review! We are glad you enjoyed it. The simplified graphics is for the best performance and max fps. The game is pretty dynamic and any drop in FPS will cause motion sickness so we are doing our best to stay on top of this. The Quest version is available for sideloading, and we also hope that sooner or later the game will reach the Quest public store too. Stay tuned for the upcoming updates!"
2022-05-28 20:04:03.233209,gavinh115,definetely recomend,"If you like quake you'll love this game. Probably the best free game on oculus right now. I feel like the game would benefit if they added these three things though. One, a private match setting where I could just play against my friends. Two, just more guns power ups and maps. I think the maps play really well in this game and the guns are very fun to use and I just wanna see more of it. And three, different game modes such as Capture the flag. All around though I think this is one of the top VR games and anyone reading this should definitely give it a shot. Also I think it's crazy how I get no motion sickness from this game even though Im swinging through the air. The devs did a really good job.","Jan 15, 2021 at 6:46 AM",5, 1,"Amazing ideas! Thanks for the feedback. Private rooms - agree! More guns - in development, we have a few more guns in head to complete the arsenal. Game modes - totally forgot about that, and just added it to the roadmap. The first two are well-known requests and the 3d one I have just added. Capture the flag and control a point or destroy another team artifact - will work on those first. Please vote for these ideas and feel free submit more at our feedback forum:
