2022-05-28 18:42:18.300594,Exelius360,Lack of features,"Not going to lie, the app in nice but it would be better if there were other things involved. For example:
• The fact that you can't drag another files into the app, like pdf or word files, or the fact that you can't see the screen of your monitor while you are working is kind of annoying.
•Sometimes the app is a little blurry, even more when you drag the whiteboard somewhere else.
•The fact that you can't share the whiteboard with other people to see it is what it makes this app a little less usefull.
• If you lack of a good wifi, prepare yourself for wires beacuse this is NOT a stand alone app.
Finally, I think this app has a lot of potencial, but it should be for more than just drawing into a whiteboard, it could be far more than that... It has one of the best systems when it comes to ""Draw into the whiteboard"" and is very intuitive. But unless is for other thing that just drawing, is still useless for academic propouses...",Aug 28 at 4:37 AM,3, 1,
2022-05-28 18:42:18.322535,DreamShaper,Aspire for More,"This is a great little utility which could be incredible.  It does what it's supposed to do, and is persistent between loads, so you can always pick up where you left off.    I approached it as an art tool, more than a notepad, and I really like what I saw in terms of potentials. 

The default palette of markers is good.  Of course, I soon wanted more.  Some major improvement could be gained by a few additions: 

 A color picker for a second set of colors would be very nice.    I'd prefer one of the joysticks for undo, and the other for marker scaling.  This would require a preference setting.  

The board is reversible and the black/white marker switches along with the eraser depending on which board state.  I'd like to have both black and white markers available at the same time, for detailing reasons.  

The persistent board is good until you erase it.  I like this.  I'd also love the ability to save/load boards.  Sometimes you get something worth keeping.   

The final feature I'd love to see, would be the ability to photograph the board and have that saved as an image file.  

I feel that these changes could be made without huge amounts of added complexity, and would make this a really interesting art tool, along with just a note tool.","Jul 14, 2020 at 8:43 AM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 18:42:18.337495,FLohPiano,little suggestions,"very nice, by the way, clean and simple. but maybe almost too simple? I think it'd be awesome if you added the capability for 1) multiple whiteboards [then use eye direction to focus specific board for writing], and 2) resizable whiteboards. this would make an incredible program for brainstorming.","Mar 22, 2020 at 10:41 AM",4, 9,
2022-05-28 18:42:18.352455,XanderMonge,Good but needs more...,"the app is clean and all, but could use different settings and more boards for more flexibility.","Mar 24, 2020 at 6:13 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 18:42:18.367415,advil102,a $1.99 worth app,very simple to use very straight forward. needs more options and settings. for example a funtion to losck the bord from moving since the grip sometimes bets press with the trigger and causes problems,"Feb 26, 2020 at 10:43 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 18:42:21.500037,scottoculus,"Good start, just need rest of features",This is a good start of a white board app but more to be added to it to really become useful. Currently not much more than The Lab white board. There was a White Board app on Steam store to use as a guide. It allowed endless board so you're not limited to a room size rectangle. It provided ability to export the white board images in different formats so you can return to real life with them. It also allowed a huge selection of colors.,"May 13, 2019 at 4:35 AM",3, 14,
2022-05-28 18:42:21.514996,cabbibo,"Masterful Interactions , Useful App","As a creator in VR I've seen so many applications fail at interfaces, interactions, and in general feel pointless. This app is the opposite! I've used it many times to sketch up quick ideas, and am so inspired by its interaction paradigms, I am willing to bet they become some of the defaults on the coming Metaverse! This one is a MUST BUY, whether you just want an app to sketch in, or if you want to study what GOOD VR looks like!","May 2, 2019 at 1:13 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:42:21.528959,gusbenz,Awesome!!!,"This app is one of those tools you didn’t know you were missing until you have it and now, I can’t imagine brainstorming without it. The app autosaves images as you work, and has provided a workspace to get all of my ideas in one place! No longer do I have to worry about someone erasing my vision board. Love it!","Apr 27, 2019 at 9:41 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 18:42:21.558879,edwon,I love whiteboarding with this!,The super minimalist UI is really fun and intuitive. I love the little details in this app. Useful for brainstorming in VR and ohhh that satisfying marker sound.,"May 15, 2019 at 5:13 AM",5, 0,
