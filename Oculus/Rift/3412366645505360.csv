Nice game but,

The proposed colors are sad.

The timer annoys me, I don't play to be the best but to relax. I don't like the impossibility of playing quietly without any notion of time.","Mar 31, 2020 at 8:28 PM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 20:18:22.438713,almightyrocko,This ain't your grandpa's Tetris!,"An addicting new take on my favorite puzzle game series! I love how responsive the blocks are when placing. Along with the sfx and the music, it's all very satisfying. 
I would love to see more palletes and more game modes in the future, maybe a 1v1 mode? 
I can see myself playing this for a long time to come to get that #1 spot!","Feb 19, 2020 at 8:07 PM",5, 5,"Thank you very much for your review! I am so happy that you enjoy the game! :)

Actually I plan to add more palettes soon. I will create a poll on my Discord channel (here is the link if you'd like to join ""https://discord.gg/VtzJPaA"") and the community will choose the new palette.
I would also like to add the multiplayer at some point in the future so stay tuned!

Thank you for purchasing my game!"
