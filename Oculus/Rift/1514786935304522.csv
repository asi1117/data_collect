Game gets very repetitive, adding a separate gamemode would add some variety. Also, possibly adding a jump function to get over small obstacles would be nice too. Moving obstacles in earlier levels would be nice. Maybe instead of switching lanes you could make it so the pig moves freely side-to-side anywhere instead of certain tracks. The character customisation is fun and trading in your targets for tomatoes is also a good idea as well. The different types of levels and areas are enjoyable and interesting. The game does get very repetitve after a while of gameplay although. For one of the  developer's first major game it was made very well but there's always room for improvement. 3/5","May 3, 2018 at 8:32 PM",3, 1,
