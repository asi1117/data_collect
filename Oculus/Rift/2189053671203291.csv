2022-05-28 19:59:03.473779,kwik5150,Super fun,Really fun and a great workout.  I'm a little bummed that you get penalized for blocking early(I would think bonus points:).   My only tiny complaint.  I love ducking and dodging the swords to get your strikes in.,Jan 11 at 8:56 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:59:03.488739,nxkr3w,kr,"Block and punch timing too strict as of now. Also very distracting to see the ""hit now"" visual coming ahead of time. Wish it could be more realistic and unintrusive.",Jan 17 at 8:17 AM,4, 0,"The purpose of the ghost outlines (""hit now"" visual) is for you to learn the timing of things and getting better the more you train. But if you don't like to see the outlines, you can simply disable them under ""Extra"" in the menu. You get to chose how you train! Keep it up. :)"
2022-05-28 19:59:03.503699,Ragnarvor,Ok this is really fun,This game is worth every penny. Give it a shot. I want more games like this.,"May 3, 2021 at 10:48 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:59:06.607524,bryanlo,great game .. going to Quest 2 ??,"First, thank you for this great game, I enjoy playing it very much. 
I had this game for more than 3 months since Aug 2020.
Great update to improve the gameplay, more fun .  good job.
I am 61 years old casual gamer, and slow learner, may not able to get into higher level.  Are there an option to allow casual gamer like me to continue to the next new level if I fail to meet the level requirement,  because I just want to move on to next level to enjoy the game if possible . please.   
if I can just set the player type to be casual, or challenger, or expert .  
The casual player is allowed to play the level once and move on to next level , if possible.  The challenger have to pass the min level requirement in order to move to next level.  and the expert player have to pass the max level requiremnt.    
one more suggest, please make this game to the new Quest 2 if possible .  Because it is a great fun Kung Fu game.  I do recommand this game to all level of player to enjoy.  Thank you.","Nov 22, 2020 at 11:48 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 19:59:06.622484,arthur67037,Update is great,"Dec. 14, 2020, re-installed the re-update, now works great again, with helpful comments or advice on how to do better after each session. Thanks to the Developer!
Dec. 11. 2020,  I installed the update, now when i punch start it kicks me out.
Please fix the problem, since I play this daily.
Also there are only 4 levels right?  Thanks, Art

Someone please fix this !  I enjoyed playing it for a couple months, then they upgraded it and now it won't load.
Thanks for fixing the loading problem.
I can see how this VR training will make me as fast IP MAN, if i do it every day :)","Dec 14, 2020 at 7:45 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:59:06.636446,Haqk1001,BIG ISSUE !!! (FIXED BY DEVELOPPERS),"this is an exellent game but i give 1 star instead of 5  for the moment because its doesn't want to load anymore, i hope they will notice this big issue.

Edit: Thanks a lot for the fix, this game is absolutly stunning !!","Nov 14, 2020 at 4:38 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:59:06.651406,TheDaddyToe,Great fun,"Fun workout.  Perfect for vr. 

But a bit unforgiving.","Oct 15, 2020 at 4:12 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:59:06.667365,Too much cake,As close to the real thing as VR can get,"This game was a bit glitchy when we first played but the developer fixed the issue the same day! Now this is a flawless (in development) experience.
A long time ago I practiced Wing Chun and have always dreamed of having a wooden dummy, this is probably the next best thing. I can see that this is definetly going to improve my reaction speed and be a good workout too. Looking forward to seeing how this game develops over time!","May 25, 2020 at 6:53 PM",5, 20,
2022-05-28 19:59:09.760692,CaptainKentucky,Amazing Game!,"Haha, I actually made a Mook Jong right before I got my oculus and this game.  Now I never use it.  The only feedback I have is that I cannot access the study levels for specific blocks and punches.  All that shows up is a figurine of a dummy posing with the Mook Jong.  There is no board to punch to start these levels.  Keep up the good work.  This game rocks!!","Jul 15, 2020 at 7:28 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:59:09.776649,Russ,"Learning like Neo from ""The Matrix""","This is one step closer to downloading how to do something like Neo does in ""The Matrix"". I'm all about realistic simulation when it comes to VR games.

 After about 30min of game play I started to feel like I was in the dojo from the movie. My spacial recognition was greatly improving and I was, punching, blocking, dodging and having a blast while doing it.

I bought the game a few days after it came out v0.25 and had a few sensor detection issues. I emailed the Developer and he got back to me within 12 hours or so and is amazing to deal with, for both feedback and response time. 

I solved the issue by resetting my sensors and guardian system (try that first) but he also quickly spent his next full day retesting and tweaking all the physics. He put out version 0.27 a day later and along with resetting my sensors is 99.9% perfect.

This game is a great workout, it trains your reflexes, hand eye coordination, spacial recognition, I mean for $12.00 this is one of the best training experiences on the Oculus store. 

Highly recommend it. And if you have any issues the developer is awesome for taking feedback and has shared with me all the future plans for the game which is only going to make it more AWESOME.

What are you waiting for, time to get your MATRIX TRAINING ON!!!","May 27, 2020 at 10:20 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 19:59:09.791116,JLN0910,"Fun, and like the real deal","Great workout for your arms lol...  great for improving reflexes too. Just started, and only got to play for about 45 mins but I love it so far.","Aug 4, 2020 at 9:04 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:59:09.807074,baoutch,Not starting,"I buy this game today, but the game won't start on my rift, is it a problem with a new version?","Nov 10, 2020 at 2:15 AM",3, 1,"Apologies for this launch bug. I have now fixed it in the latest version, along with added lots of new content! :)"
2022-05-28 19:59:09.823031,OneShootBoy,Very funny but bit buggy,"The game is awesome. i needed a bit pratice before getting into it. but the results are really funny and amazing. finally a game also my younger sister can easly play and understand. The single problem i found, except the number of levels (just  5), is the menu that most of time bug itself dening me to choose level, consult the study and this kind of stuff. every time i'm in need to restart the game. thankfully god it's very small so it start very quickly","Jun 4, 2020 at 3:42 PM",4, 2,"Thanks for the review and feedback. Glad your sister is enjoying it too! As this is an Early Access title, I am pushing regular updates with fixes, new modes as well as soon new levels all based on player feedback. There are already a range of extras you can add to the current levels, and I will be adding more over time. 
Sorry to hear you are having issues with the menu, if you can send me an email with some more details I will make sure to crush those bugs in the next update for you! arnaud@fiedof.vision

Update: I found the issue and patched it in the latest update. Thanks for pointing it out! :)"
2022-05-28 19:59:12.898895,ralphtaylor1961,Very good martial arts practice game,"Crazy kung fu will work your reaction time for blocks,parries, and strikes. I wish it would have a center punch target like the real wooden dummies to strike.","May 31, 2020 at 7:08 PM",4, 4,
