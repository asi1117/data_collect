2022-05-28 18:44:53.878479,liamkennedy2000,Would not recommend!,"For starters, the graphics are pretty bad and pixalated and there is only 3 things you can do before having to pay ( in my opinion) way to much just for a minute riding in a roller coaster. If you want to ride rollercoasters and have epic fun then you can defenitly have more epic fun just playing the absaloutely free, epic rollercoasters. This was one of my first games I downloaded when i got pcvr and this sh*t show will stick in my mind forever. Cheers!",Feb 27 at 1:29 AM,1, 2,

2022-05-28 18:44:53.937321,Bob-Rolha,"Running fast, with an i5-2310 and GXT970","Cool, with simplistic scenarios. Running fast, with an modest i5-2310 and a GXT970, in a very fluid and satisfying way. I didn't feel sick on the roller coaster, what miracles did you do?
The problem is that the screen goes black for each change of attraction. Then I have to exit and restart the application, because only one game works at a time.","Aug 31, 2020 at 12:01 PM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 18:44:57.112828,Raizingsun,Great Coaster/Shooting Fun!,"If you like the free coaster here (and why not try it out, it is free!) then I would recommend the full pack of all the coasters for 9.99. I like the way these coasters have a number of scene changes across the ride, and all of them are as long as varied as the free one (the Western coaster is a favorite of mine). The shooting is done well and there are some nice achievements to be earned that add some replay value. Since this is from the same developer as Epic Roller Coasters, I hope they add a 'race' mode as well, but I'm very happy with my purchase of the complete pack right now (the shooting gallery game is nice, but really it is the coasters that make the dlc worth the purchase and then think of the shooting gallery and ferris wheel ride as a bonus on top)","Mar 6, 2020 at 10:00 AM",5, 3,
