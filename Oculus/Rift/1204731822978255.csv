2022-05-28 18:55:46.128942,sam.bauman.9,SEVERE NAUSIA WARNING,"Aircar is an EXCELLENT tech demo. Flying around a rainy cyberpunk city with cargo ships going overhead and civilian hovercraft flying beneath is fantastic. The controls are a bit complex for me, but the joy of weaving between huge neon-lit skyscrapers is a true wonder. 
BUT...
The ""Intense"" Comfort rating is no joke. I can only play for 3 minutes at a time before becoming so motion sick I have to stop and take off the headset. This is something that has NEVER happened to me in VR before. The world is a visual treat and I imagine that it would be fantastic to relax and cruise around in it, but flying, turning, and rolling an air vehicle in 3 dimensions like this is simply too much for me. Maybe you'll have a stronger resistance to this sort of thing, and if so you will absolutely love this experience.",Jan 1 at 2:12 PM,5, 8,
2022-05-28 18:55:46.143902,Imagine losing ,way better than it has any right to be!,"overall actually really great, the game looks like a movie, but in the full version i would like to see:

1. Faster ships 
2. diffrent ships 
3. a diffrent death screen 
4. the world should interact more with the player ships dodging colision with the player  ( for example if u hover over water the water should react)
5. an actual goal apart from the boosts ( maybe the player could be a dilevery driver )
6. a bigger city which should focus on being a play ground more than a pretty city 
7. the controls need to change, it is super weird that the left stcik controls arent nverted but the controls on the right stick are",13 days ago,5, 0,

Pros: Flying the ship is very relaxing, nice view. Also you can do tricks with the ship (Flipping the car, etc.) which is fun sometimes.
Cons: It would be cool if you were able to change the time of day or weather. City would look cool in the snow. Pretty weird controls, but still 5 stars. Good game.

Flying the ship is fun, and after you found out how, it's very relaxing to just fly around and enjoy the view. It's not good for people with motion sickness; I'd wish they make some more option, like change the weather, or remove the sounds.

Beautiful rendering and lightning, lovely accompanying music, and best of all, having an Oculus Rift S I first thought it wouldn't work, but it did, then after fiddling with buttons I pressed A or B on the right controller and I was sitting in the Aircar in a garage, and a bit more twiddling and I was flying it. How very lovely.","Jun 13, 2021 at 8:38 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:55:55.581659,razorn,Fantastic,"This game makes me yearn for a full Blade Runner VR experience, or maybe even Altered Carbon. Rain hitting glass, as you fly past neon-signed, looming skyscrapers at night; weaving through traffic while subtle music plays - not Vangelis and his Yamaha CS80, but still very pretty nonetheless. This is a small, but excellent experience in its own right; a vingette of what is possible, but - if you're anything like me - once played, you'll want more and feel a bit dejected that there isn't. I hope the developer adds more to this in time.","May 26, 2021 at 2:03 AM",5, 7,

I went from being able to FLY FAST  to being able to fly 5 times slower until I find Turbo things and 'earn' what used to be a baseline. SPEED..  It seems that you only reach the full speed (the old BASE SPEED)  after finding all 5 turbos,.  BUT AS GOOD AS I AM AT THIS AND HAVE PLAYED FOR YEARS,  I HAVE NEVER ONCE ACQUIRED ALL FIVE TURBOS BEFORE RUNNING OUT OF FUEL...  Which tells me, even if I DO find all five,.  I WILL THEN RUN OUT OF FUEL BEFOER I CAN ENJOY IT EVEN A MINUTE,.  No motivation to play anymore.. .   
GRAPHICS = UPGRADE,   GAMEPLAY= PUNISHMENT/DOWNGRADE PURE AND SIMPLE. 
Thank goodness I kept a copy of every build that ever went up.    I hope maybe he adds a way to REFUEL becuase TURBOS are USELESS if you have no more FUEL to USE THEM.  :(","Dec 3, 2020 at 1:45 AM",3, 7,

2022-05-28 18:56:01.991515,SMBGCTech,Theraputic,"First off, it's FREE.  ENJOY.  2nd; this game is fantastic in giving a true feel of VR at a not so intense manner.  The music is eloquent.  The rain beating off the glass, the subtle sounds of comm chatter. Soaring up so high to see the entire city, and then to swoop down into the block by block traffic. Finding the various landing pads, with Turbo upgrades, is a cool little mini-game as well.  You can easily lose time for a good 30 minutes to an hour.  I use it for stress relief (and of course to satisfy my near 40 year-old Blade Runner fantasies).  

Fantastic piece of work!
Kudos to the creators!

2022-05-28 18:56:05.109177,Angelina Starr,The app I end my Rift night with.,"EDIT 11-28-20   It pains me to reduce my 5 star rating to 3-1/2 stars but the addition of all the goofy bright neon signs and statues just ruined the whole experience for me.  It used to be dark, moody and solemn but now it's a caricature of some old, low budget Batman movie.  Ugh.
----------------------------------------------------
After a night of gaming and before I settle in to bed, I love powering up my Aircar and just flying around the rain swept city and relaxing a bit.  I love this little program.  It does so much with little fanfare.

As others have stated, I would love to see an expanded use of this engine for Aircar.  Perhaps some multiplayer pylon racing or mid air bumper cars or who knows.  Maybe just a huge, wet world to explore beyond the edges of the city.

Just leave the laser blasters out of it...grin....","Nov 28, 2020 at 4:48 PM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 18:56:05.140094,1Em1,"Cool, but unstable","When this simulation is working, I enjoy it.  But after a little while of using the program it crashes with an Unreal engine error to line 198.  It looses its connection to the D3D device.  On a more positive note, I feel more validated with the controls for the portfolio project I'm working on.  It is nice to see a much more polished simulation using a similar, but not exactly the same, approach to controling the player movement.  I don't think I'll be able to come close to how cool the scene looks, I really like how your futuristic cityscape looks.","Oct 11, 2020 at 12:52 PM",4, 5,

Be aware this is not a fast paced flying FPS or MSFS 2020 (though if the devs polish MSFS 2020 to run like this then that will be VR heaven too).

You can fly it while they sit in a chair and marvel.  The real advantage here is you can fly for them and get around to everywhere without pitch and roll (right thumb stick) and it won't make anyone motion sick, or at least greatly reduce it.  Great graphics, music, and design.","Aug 25, 2020 at 3:48 PM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 18:56:11.486121,YoeyYutch,The new refueling platforms are cool.,"I think I've found five of the refueling/turbo boost platforms. Still some more searching to do. I thought this game was a really nice time killer when I first got Oculus back in 2018. Without any real objectives, I didn't play it much over the past couple years. So it was a nice surprise to see that the latest update added some landing platforms to search for. 

I really like the atmosphere of the game, with the dark dreary weather, rain pounding on the windshield of the craft, the gibberish air traffic control radio chatter, the sounds and music all work together to create an immersive experience. 

My only gripe really, is that when I travel to the rundown portions of the city across the water, I run into invisible barriers that cause me to crash and I have to start over. It takes some time to get there so it's a little bit annoying, Other than that I think it's really well done and could definitely be expanded upon even further as anything from a taxi game, to a racing game to lots of genres really.","Jul 20, 2020 at 7:35 PM",5, 10,

Aircar is extremly immersive and oddly relaxing, a bit like driving your car at night on a lonely highway, i sometimes play this just to chill out.

I play vr for more than three years and just revisited this as i upgraded to quest+link. And holy moly this is still one of the best vr experiences. The setting, the music, the rainy mood, it all just fits perfect and gives me heavy ghost in the shell vibes. 

The graphics are still very decent and keep great balance between quality and performance. Especially keeping in mind this is free and so might had a rather limited budget. The devs realy hit a sweet spot where single objects are rather basic, but the city as whole mix off buildings, traffic etc. looks stunning and alive.

Also the flying experience is just great, other flight sims from DCS to Ultrawings hardly ever make me feel motion - Aircar does and is the only sim that can get me a bit motion sick when doing fast turns, but thats just proof of how immersive this is and nothing negative - flying such manouvers in a real plane will make u much sicker, so if youre prone to sickness, just go easy on the controls.

Btw. Its easy to miss, but theres a little gameplay as you can find landing pads scattered around town where you can land and upgrade your turbo to go faster.  Check the sides of large Buildings, if youre in the right spot an autopilot will perform the landing - also you will refuel while landed.

Some may renember the 90s SimCopter from Maxis, where you had a charter-helicoter company, did rescue, taxi and firefighting missions and upgraded/bought choppers with the earned money. 
This + Aircar = awesome - only thing missing would be Leeloo dropping through the roof.","Jan 24, 2020 at 6:34 AM",5, 22,

Use your Debug tool/Oculus Tray tool. The default screen percentage (100) isn't equal to 1.0-pixel density, it's lower (0.76). Setting the screen percentage to 130=0.99-pixel density. 140=1.07-pixel density.

Specs: Ryzen R5 1600 (Stock), 16GB RAM @2667Mhz, GTX 1060 6GB OC'd to 2.1Ghz (Core) & 4.7Ghz (Memory).

Here are the best possible settings for my config with 0 frame drops:
Post Process Quality: 4
Shadow Quality: 2
Texture Quality: 4
Effects Quality: 4
Screen Percentage: 180 (1.34-pixel density)
Anti-Aliasing: 0
If you're dropping frames, try a Screen Percentage of 150 (1.13).

I prefer Post-Precessing be set to ""2"" as ""3"" or above creates a bloom like an effect around all light sources. Settings Shadow Quality to ""1"" removes all shadows and breaks immersion (for me at least). Setting this to ""3"" or above increases the resolution at which shadows will be rendered. Whether I set Textures/Effects Quality to ""1"" or ""4"" I couldn't tell a difference but for peace of mind, I left them at 4 as I saw little to no performance hit. Unless you're playing with a screen percentage set to 270 (2.01-pixel density) or higher PLEASE, leave Anti-Aliasing set to 0, otherwise, set it to 1. It's not MSAA or SMAA. It's more like FXAA and TSAA had a baby. It blurs your entire image and reduces the overall brightness of objects.

But, if you're like me and ASW doesn't bother you (or you disable it entirely) these settings will have the game looking it's best (for my hardware's sake) without running like complete sh*t.

Settings: (ASW Will Be Enabled 90% Of The Time)
Post Process Quality: 2
Shadow Quality: 2
Texture Quality: 4
Effects Quality: 4
Screen Percentage: 250 (1.90-pixel density) Everything's clear!

2022-05-28 18:56:42.984873,K4tniss,,"I've played a couple small 'flying sims/flying experiences' on rift before, this has been the most compelling of any of them.

The environment, a combination of your cockpit, the city, the rain, and the music - are all really cool. I just loved existing in this world with them. When I started the game, I got vertigo looking out the windows of the cockpit, but the cockpit felt real enough that I was safe. I *pretended* to punch buttons and make beep and click noises for them to 'adjust things', since you don't presently have 'hands' in the game, even with touch. 
Oh, and when you are near enough to a landing site you hear indistinct radio voices implying like landing control or similar.
This game seems to know how much to imply and how much to actually include to create a really fun universe that I want more of.

The controls are simple and effective. The UI in the cockpit is interesting, and readable. There are places to find and 'land' to get powerups and that's so much more effective and compelling than I expected.

I found myself dodging and weaving through the traffic for fun. I flew so far out of bounds that the game *teleported me back to spawn* (or maybe it thought I'd died) becaused I just wanted to see if there would be a landing pad on one of the radio antennae that I initially thought were part of the *skybox*

I would love an expanded sandbox on this concept - just a few mission-givers for delivery/pickup maybe to add flavour. You could give players hints rather than gps 'markers' to encourage them to explore the city and/or find their own routes.

I'd also love the ability to use touch control *as* touch control, even if pushing the buttons in the cockpit had *no* functionality and made cool beep noises.

The athmosphere of this game is PERFECT! It's clearly Blade Runner inspired, with a dash of old classics like G-Police. The city is breath taking, the controls are solid, and pulling acrobatic manoeuvres is a lot of fun (but can give sickness).
As i said, there's not lot to do, and yet, just exploring the city is fun.
I really hope this game will become something bigger, more like a complete product, cause i feel like a good 80% of the core gameplay is already here, all they need is just more locations, more ships, and more missions.
Edit: I was forgetting, the fact that this game is free is incredibly generous, i would certainly be happy to pay good money to play a more complete version of this.","Aug 12, 2019 at 2:19 AM",5, 11,

Running update 1.2, while the initial car is loading there is a big crackle in the audio, then complete silence. The car will finish loading, but instantly when you try to move it in any direction it freezes and goes to the busy symbol and never moves again. Tried many times. Exactly the same every time. So weary of things ont working for Oculus, especially this one. I don't want my money back. I want it TO WORK. Odd concept, eh? UPDATE: Couple of cold boots and reinstalls and the car can be flown now, but no sound at all, not even the crackle. UPDATE: Crashing again after reinstalls. Now it crashes immediately upon loading. I have about 80 games on 3 different headsets. This is the only one giving me grief. --Figures, since this was my go-to demo game. Will this ever be fixed or should I just uninstall it forever? UPDATE: Yet another uninstall and reinstall. For about twenty seconds had music, but not the beautiful, fitting, appropriate music it had for ages -- now it's some utterly absurd music that does not even remotely fit the environment or the experience. But even that all ended when the game jerked the view around about twenty times in rapic succession, then no audio at all. I'm sorry, but this is now a write-off. No time or patience for this anymore.  As stupendously great as it was, it gets deleted. Maybe in a year I'll take another look. So profoundly disappointed. When will Oculus start demanding that their apps WORK? Things like this are a killer to VR. Just poison. I see other reviewers experiencing the same and similar problems. UPDATE: Got it to work intermittently but still no sound (sound fine in all other games and apps). But now the controls are so alien that it's no longer useful as a demo for newbies because no one can control the car. Sometimes, dear Dev, less is more. UPDATE mid Sept 2019, doesn't work at all.

Piloting a flying car around the rainy future city is incredibly immersive.  Now it's been updated with a lick of polish - vertical flight controls, some extra neon signs and holographic sculptures, plus a handful of detailed landing pads to find (and upgrade your boost meter) to give the experience some hint of a goal.  Not that it's necessary - this is clearly in the ""tech demo"" realm rather than anything resembling a full game, but it's a pleasure just to tool around checking out every corner of the little city in your flying car.

A demo that lets you enjoy flying! I'm new to this VR thing. Purchased my Rift a week ago. Like the others below, out of all the VR experiences I've had this week Aircar was the most fun!! The Blade Runner rainy theme is fine but how about different climates, different cities, refueling stations...in the air! Would love to fly on a sunny day and in a world that gives you different flying scenarios without someone trying to steal your stuff or blow your head off. 

Most people want the shoot shoot, kill kill games and yes they ARE fun but depending on future development would it be possible to make a game with scenarios like Search and Rescue or other similar activities. How about the ability to fly to a VR friends house or city and hang out with them. HOW ABOUT THE ABILITY TO PLAY YOUR OWN MUSIC IN YOUR AIRCAR WHILE CRUISING! Like christoffa-uk said "" Bigger areas, bigger and different cars and for me different scenarios that involve the amazing flying experience you get with Aircar!

I love the whole vibe of a futuristic city with aircars, covered with rain, with this kind of music. It is so incredibly calming and satisfying to immerse yourself in. 
It is also the best way to check where ou land on a motion sickness scale, but its not like you have to do barell rolls to play this.

- Nothing really to do, so very limited replay ability.

- Very nice visuals, especially love the rain effect.

Leave the hanger, Put your tail down, and go up about 40 miles. (Altimeter dosn't show 100 of 1000's of feet)

Look around the area, ""Land"" on surfaces, Crash in the sea.

It is possible to Crash&Burn back to the hanger.

G-Police or

Still, great experience -- very immersive cockpit and good graphics (I have a 1080GTX  -- I use the Oculus debugger to render at 2.0 and then turn shadows down in game for a great graphical and smooth exprience).

Nothing much to do, but it's nice flying around.  Oh, if you're like me and you get sick playing this, tip:  *DO NOT* lean one way with your body while tilting another way with the ship.  Puke factor increases 10x.

Instead, lead sideways when you turn sideways, look forward/down when you dive, lean back/up when you climb, and twist in your chair when you yaw (helps to have a swivel desk chair for all this).  If you follow that, sick factor is very low but on my first play I didn't and boy I'm still paying for it 10 minutes later (woozy but no barfing)!

But I still give this 4 stars simply because it's a really nice experience to play. It's dark and rainy and quite calming, and you can just explore, or sit still in the air, and look around. It made me feel a bit dizzy when making the aircar roll a bit - which is something I have experienced being in a glider before during the same kind of manouvre.

Only a cyberpunk RPG or action game would really do this justice, not purely a flying sim. Oh its just wishful thinking I know, no company would pour those resources into a VR game this early in the lifecycle with the small userbase. A man could dream.

Anyone who has played any Deus Ex game might understand, the flying sections are just cut scenes. If this was the flying scene, with actual monitoring of surroundings and scanning the ground for crimes or points of interest (the panel on the dash to the left would be perfect) this would become an instant classic.

Just shows what can be achieved with Unreal Engine 4 in VR. Its nice and relaxing just flying around. However It would make quite a good base for a simple arcade type game. I envision something a bit like Alianator on the Amiga. Alien ships abducting civilians, you have to shoot them down before they get the civilians to a mothership hanging high above the city.  If they manage to get say three civilians to the ship an offensive alien ship is sent out to gun you down. which you then have to dog fight.","Mar 15, 2018 at 8:29 PM",4, 0,

However (spoiler alert); navigating the air car from high to low altitude and around sharp turns was truly a visceral gut-rench.  I think I have a high tolerance for most queasy VR experiences.  It took fortitude to stick it out for about 30 minutes to get a real orchestrated hand of the joysticks, but then I sought in vain for a purpose beyond just managing my own gut reaction.

Simple basics, but it would add so much! A the moment there's not much to do but to explore the surroundings, but even so the experience is amazing!

To be honest, I was doing fine turning around like a car with the ground flat beneath me. It was when I tried to do the flying part and roll 45° into a turn that my stomach would lurch. 

Maybe I shouldn't have tried it with the turbo engaged while pretending I was Luke Skywalking starting the trench run at full throttle? ""Yes Biggs, we will pull up in time, but our stomach will have different ideas about the sudden change in direction when there's a total lack of g-force affecting the rest of your body!""

9 out of 10 thumbs up! Would vomit again for a sequel.

Also, yes it would be great if the flight controls on-screen matched your movements and maybe add a splash of green to those distant hills (i'm guessing they are static ocean waves at the moment?) 

Basically it could use some minor touch-ups like making the ground in the trenches solid so you can't fly through the floor, and make the water less-solid so you don't bounce backwards and crash when you want to cause a splash.

2022-05-28 19:00:21.937253,Bandleader,-= Please make this into a game ! =-,"It is certainly no coincidence that this flight simulator carries the title ""Air Car"". The references to Ridley Scott's cult classic BLADE RUNNER can also be found in alot of design decisions and also the soundtrack creates a similar atmosphere. In terms of graphics I am only missing dynamic lighting, some density like fog and smog or floating particles in the air. The cockpit is beautifully designed and has that lovely retro sci-fi touch to it. I also love the raindrops on the windshield, but it's a pity that no actual rain is simulated. This would make the simulation so much more convincing. For that the controls of the car feel surprisingly convincing and are easy to learn. Even the slight motion sickness you can experience by flying extreme maneuvers makes the simulation even more realistic. For now it is just cruising around exploring the dystopian city wich is amazing for a free simulator. But imagine beeing chased or chasing others or just having an actual goal to achieve. This is why I could not give a 5 star rating as this software is more of a showcase for something bigger.

I mean you could place billboards in the game to finance further development and it would even benefit the design giving the city a breath of life and this title could stay free to play and still be profitable.

This piece of software has so much potential! I would love to see this title involve into a game with some depth and purpose.","Nov 27, 2017 at 8:37 PM",4, 1,

I would like to be able to see my hands and grab the control yoke and flip switches and push buttons in an experience like this.  I flew back to the hangar bay when my fuel got low hoping to refuel and tried to land on a building, but could not.  Perhaps in a future version of what this becomes those will be available options?

Great that you can disable the background music! Allows me to listen to my own music (calling bladerunner ost here) 

Better Rain Sounds - Would feel so much better and immersive with a better feeling that it rains outside.  
Improve Sound overall - Invest more time in the sound design, really enhances the expirience.

Bigger City or more details on the lower levels

Hands! The immersion would greatly enhance if you could use hands to steer enable boost or just click some buttons.

Faster speed - Bigger city = faster car

Enable to park the car on the ground on freighters etc.

2022-05-28 19:01:51.301237,Z3R0B4NG,Very Good VR Cockpit Experience,"This is obviously a simple and limited Tech Demo, but it really makes me want more of this type of game. I'd like the vehicle to move a bit faster and i don't think there are any breaks it just slows down when you let go of the throttle, there are no Newtonian physics or gravity and i think if the vehicle would rumble and make engine sounds and maybe shake a little at high speeds and so on it could be a ton more immersive.  
Overall it is a good cockpit experience, you feel like you are actually in a Vehicle and flying around the city, there are other vehicles moving around in the air and it is really fun to fly circles around them.  
The instruments in the cockpit are very readable and give you information like speed and orientation, that was a nice touch.  

Ultimately this shows the potential for Cockpit based games, now i want to fly an X-Wing ...or a Viper from BSG and make some Rouge Squadron type game with it, or maybe Ace Combat.  

There was some mild Vertigo when i did crazier maneuvers, but that is nothing compared to what real Pilots must be subjected to (a rolercoaster is probably much worse and people do that for fun...), so that is a positive in my eyes that it gets me maybe 10% of the way there and actually helps the immersion, but maybe don't play this for 5 hours straight.","Sep 28, 2017 at 6:52 PM",4, 0,

I hold a commercial and Instrument flying license.  This game accomplished what my years of training couldn’t, it gave me spatial disorientation to a degree I had to set the simulation down on the street, (I’m a professional, couldn’t just pull the plug), and go lay down and couldn’t eat for several hours.  The fact it could make me sick is actually a good thing, because it means it comes close to the real sensations of flight. The game will not attract players if they become ill. Here’s my advice.  The Xbox controller configuration is opposite of what MS Flight simulator or Lockheed Martin’s Prepar3D uses. The pitch and bank should be on the left stick and yaw on the right.  Being able to reconfigure the controls to fly in a familiar manner should be part of the settings.  Giving the player some things to focus on will also help, I suggest a better horizontal situation indicator on the center control panel. This gives the eye something to reference while flying and helps prevent nausea. Tactile vibration feedback on the controller also helps.  I hope to return to play the simulator, just not with a full stomach.","Aug 22, 2017 at 8:12 AM",4, 4,

My only complaint is that there isn't a bed in the interior to lay down in. There's also an amusing little thing if you let the car run out of fuel. There's no reason not to check this out.","Aug 23, 2017 at 3:05 PM",5, 3,

Obviously there are bugs that will be fixed if development continues (the controls like to move into the dashboard) and it's a relatively small world that actually has 3d buildings (but they look great, I found myself flying around looking in windows even though they are just 2d textures slapped on awesome 3d buildings), and it really needs an ""up/down"" option on the left stick (essentially thrusters pointed straight down and straight up, so your relative facing is unchanged) and like elite dangerous, for those long drives you really need the ability to project youtube/netflix into the cockpit (don't tell the highway cops).  

But I spent over 30 minutes just flying around and it's moved to the top of my list of things to show friends to demo VR. Looks great.  [Also the speed indicator is probably about 10 times your actual speed, those rain drops are not moving 150 mph].
