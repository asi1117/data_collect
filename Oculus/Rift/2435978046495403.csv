2022-05-28 20:49:01.532662,1foggy,Fun Arkanoid-style game but in VR,"This game had no reveiws when I bought it, but I'm a sucker for Breakout/Arkanoid type games so I had to give it a shot.  Gravity Pro is worth the price of admission.   It took me a few rounds to adjust to using the paddles, not because of any controls issues, but because my first instinct was to smash the ball around in hopes that it would hit the target.  But really, a subtle touch on the paddles is needed in order to finesse some of the more difficult or accurate shots.  Good variety in level types, great sounds (many reminiscent of high end drum machines), and the graphics are nice.   If you're into the old brick smashing games, this one doesn't disappoint.  Lots of options for controls as well, looks like you can use VR controllers, keyboard, or other peripherals that it detects through your computer.","Mar 22, 2020 at 1:02 PM",5, 10,"I'm glad you liked the game. It is true that it requires a little practice to learn the right technique. I noticed that the longer the player plays, the more he enjoys it. However, I would like to help new players to develop this skill faster, so in the next update, there will be more tips on how to better control the game.
Thank you for the great review!"
