2022-05-28 19:13:47.242351,FastLawyer,Artistic cinematic experience,"So this is a purely VR cinematic experience, focused on this type of art.  The reason I only give it three stars is because I'm not sure the experience is worth the $1.99.  I know $1.99 is not a lot, but still, you can buy a TV episode (SD) for that much or a song or a different VR game, and even rent some movies on sale.  So even at the low price, there is other stuff to compare it to and judge whether the entertainment value is worth the cost.  I think it depends on whether you really love the visuals here.  That's because, the story really is not there.  So you're left with the hand-drawn visuals.  I guess that's in the eye of the beholder, but I wasn't impressed that much.  There were nice moments, but I was never blown away.  I think it may be worth it to some just to experience this type of art in VR.  But even the Van Gogh VR app that is free was more entertaining for me.  I like to support the arts and this is a new medium, so I can applaud the effort, even if the execution was less than stellar.","Jan 25, 2018 at 2:37 PM",3, 2,

The visuals are great, a living and charming sketch that shows you a handdrawn look on reality. And yes, you can buy a lot of garbage for € 1,99, but this is art – unique!","Jan 26, 2018 at 3:09 AM",5, 1,
