2022-05-28 15:12:19.917137,Zennecko,Crashes after a minute on quest 2,"I would really like to play this game since I wanted to try a side-scroller on VR and witchblood got my attention, speccially since there are not many games that have Spanish audio. I apprecciate that.
But on my quest 2 it always crashes after a minute of playing. I do not think it is my hardware , i can run half life: alyx with high to higuest settings with no crash.
I would apprecciate is devs could maybe give me some pointers on what i could try to make it work. Thanks",Nov 29 at 3:41 AM,2, 6,"Sorry to hear that.  Witchblood was developed for the Oculus Rift, not the Quest 2.  This is probably where the problem lies."
2022-05-28 15:12:19.932097,dantespara,A decent metroidvania,"beat the game in about 6 hours some of which was trying to find out where to go and it was kinda the games fault. Theres a point in the game where you can jump up and go into another area but everytime i tried it wouldnt work.... so i figured i might need a double jump or something. NOPE just have to keep trying until the game lets you up there.

But besides the few instances when that happens in the game its really fun. honestly theres no real reason that this game would HAVE to be a VR game but the extra dimension of VR does make it more enjoyable IMO.

TL/DR: its worth the 8 dollars if you like metroidvania games! also keep trying to jump up to the next area if your stuck.",Jul 19 at 2:44 AM,4, 1,

2022-05-28 15:12:19.961020,mayhemreigns,What a wonderful game,"It uses VR to enhance the presentation without letting the VR aspect get in the way of gameplay. The art style is lighthearted but fantastic. It reminds me a little bit of Moss in that aspect, but I feel the gameplay here is much better. If you like side scrolling action games where you gradually unlock areas with abilities you gain(think some of the later 2D Castlevania games with a more lighthearted style), you will feel right at home here. For those still getting used to VR, this is a good place to start due to the relatively stable view perspective.","Apr 25, 2021 at 11:27 PM",5, 1,

Its more like playing a fairly basic adventure/platformer on a 3D monitor, and unfortunately there are *much* better metroidvania-style games out that aren't in 3D, and the 3D just doesn't make up for the difference.","Dec 20, 2019 at 12:09 AM",2, 2,

2022-05-28 15:12:26.296076,john.c.linstrum,Great Game,"This game is gorgeous looking, its gameplay is really good, and at normal difficulty level it presents plenty of challenge. A couple of reviewers have implied that the game was too short, but I'm only about halfway through and I definitely don't feel that way. I did restart it a couple of times because I got hella lost, but I think now I've gotten the hang of it.

One thing to keep in mind is there's not a lot of online community help if you want to get hints to get past tough spots (no wiki, no maps, etc.). There is a walkthrough on Youtube which is quite good, but you have to search through 2 90 minute videos to get to where you're stuck (groan). That said, if you're up for a bit of a challenge, this is a great game.","Jul 1, 2019 at 9:41 AM",5, 9,

The controls and options are straightforward and there isn't a ton of complexity, which makes it easy to pick up and understand. The way the map is displayed all around the room you are currently in was really novel and makes navigation a bit more intuitive than simply pulling up a map screen.","Jun 20, 2019 at 10:24 PM",4, 8,

2022-05-28 15:12:32.604204,MarkRushow,Thank the devs for taking a risk,"I knew VR was going to awesome for 3rd person and classic styles of gameplay. So many doubted me. Sure it seems counter intuative to those that lack vision to make anything other than first person experiences in VR. But here's the thing... both can exist and be awesome. This game is really cool. Witchblade, Chronos, and Lucky's Tale are showing classic game styles work very well in VR indeed. It is like viewing an awesome doll house with action figures made of clay come to life. I really want to explore the z-axis corridors but that would pose a problem that I hope someone can figure out in future edevours. Thank you for taking a risk on this game. I really want to see more.

Definitely recommend if you like platformers, but even more so if you are a fan of castlevania type of games.  I really enjoy the way they are doing the story, the way they add different abilities as you go along, and the overall gameplay of the game.

Last time I played something like this back in NES era. The last boss is a real pain in the back. Skills of the hero are not useless you really need to use at least half of them most of the time.

I am a retro gamer at heart and metroicvanias are my jam. This game has a surprising amount of great things going on. Enchanting graphics, Gorgeous environments, decent size map to explore, boss fights, power ups, engaging story and characters. I am in love with this side scrolling VR genre. Could you imagine an actual Castlevania done in this same fashion?! Seriously, if you are an old school gamer and grew up on Nintendo and the likes of side scrolling platformers, you gotta get this game. You will thank me.","Jun 15, 2018 at 11:52 AM",5, 7,

It's a Metroidvania style platformer set in a beautiful 3D diorama. It has the most brilliant in-game mapping system so you don't get lost and so you know where you can explore next. I have been using the touch controllers, but I have seen it played with a gamepad as well. The controlls are very fluid and you have the option to choose your degree of difficulty. Even with the difficulty set to ""Casual"", it's just challenging enough to be enjoyable.

You can sit or stand with this game, but I perfer to sit. Some of the scenes are built out around you which is cool for platformer and did I mention this game won't make you sick.

The voiceover storytelling is sprinkled in and doesn't disrupt your gameplay. A lot of love was put into this game. This is the kind of game I'd like to make. Check it out it's really fun!","Jun 29, 2018 at 2:35 PM",5, 11,

I think it's a very well done game, if you couldn't tell. Very engaging, with a good little story. But the best part is the graphics. It's like watching a 3d cartoon, but controlling one of the characters... doll-size. I will be keeping a look out for other games by this company.","Jun 18, 2018 at 9:52 AM",5, 4,

VR element brings a cool doll house effect + the possibility to dive in for a closer look at the action. As criticism I'll note that even though there are skill upgrades during the journey, the gameplay does not vary much. It may depend on your playstyle a bit, but in the end it's pretty basic hack and slash.

2022-05-28 15:12:45.221457,YiKwang,Neo Retro Fantastica,"If you are a long-time fan of the truly classic RPGs, or if you are a younger fan of the Platform RGP genre, this is for you.

This game features many of the best things about old Platform RPGs such as Metroid, the map design makes good use of space, providing secret passageways and bonus items which are easily located by those who keep an eye on the rooms they travel through. There is also a map display around the room you are in which roughly details what you know about the surrounding rooms - a touch I quite appreciate.

The combat (at least at first) features a lot of melee, which gave me a nice nostalgic Zelda I or II vibe, and the overall style of the game is very 64 era Zelda. The rural and natural lands laced with imposing structures are especially reminiscant of many classic Japanese worlds.

Overall I highly, highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys the kinds of titles mentioned above. Solid music, graphics, narration, and a likeable main character suffering a common, but none-the-less endearing, plight.","Jan 10, 2018 at 3:39 PM",5, 3,

So you finally make it to him and have to fight him and lets just say its not fun at all. This was on easy too! WTH!??  I really don't know why developers bother putting different difficulty settings in these games when they don't make a bit of difference. I eventually gave up because i could not beat the end boss.

I'm not very fond of backtracking and searching hidden secrets. I like the idea of a diorama like Trine or even Castlevania back in the day, but I must admit I am also an ""content tourist"" and somewhat casual player. This is not the game for that I think. I tried  a second time from the beginning to see if a new try would change things. And well, I did get stucked at the same place. With no motivation to go on (graphics and gameplay is not very good), I decided to uninstall it, and never play again. I have better things to do than this, sorry..

2022-05-28 15:12:57.868630,bigwinnerx,,Enjoyable and very nice to look at.  The diorama look and the way the map falls around the edges is great.  Graphics are top notch.  Very nice surprise during the summer sale.,"Sep 2, 2017 at 11:32 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 15:12:57.884588,itsrumsey,Classic Metroidvania,"A by the book Metroidvania with nice production quality, great audio, and simple gameplay elements.  Difficulty not too high.  There is a fantastic ""wall map"" around your play area that really adds another level to the Metroidvania formula HOWEVER... 

The reason I'm docking a star is that the ""in menu"" map is awful. Atrocious. Literally unusable, and I do mean literally.  In the Rift it just looks like a smudge of lines, you can not make out any detail whatsover.  Why couldn't they just have a scaled down version of the beautiful wall map in the map menu?  No clue, but this is a major mistake. 

Secondly, there is no in game option for super sampling, which I feel is just lazy on the part of developers.","Aug 7, 2017 at 7:49 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 15:12:57.914508,MatteAce,a fun little metroidvania!,"Witchblood is really a fun little metroidvania, that you can enjoy sitting. the playstyle is similar to when in Lucky's Tale you go underground. 

The game is definitely fun, it would have been fun even without VR but playing it with your Rift really helps with the immersion. 
The price is right so I absolutely recommend the purchase to all the metroidvania/platform-action game fans!","Aug 2, 2017 at 1:33 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 15:12:57.930465,Nukemarine,Oculus needs to advertise this more,"This game that came out of nowhere is really impressive for its low cost. As others note, this feels like a proper VR version of a 2D platformer like Metroid and Castlevania in the late 80s / early 90. The single box diorama approach works great and lets you appreciate the scale of the world even without pausing. 

Look forward to more diorama games like this in the future.","Jun 10, 2017 at 4:53 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 15:13:01.023193,Gatemoon,It's ok.,"This is a pure metroidvania. This game is released 2017 and giving this a 5 star rating would put this in the same league as ""Ori and the blind forest"" and that's just wrong. Sure this is cheaper but this game is nowhere close a 5 star rating.  It's a nice little game and it's worth the money playing it in VR but don't expect a masterpiece. 

Graphics looks very good for a game from the year 2000. In other words, it looks dated and simplistic but it's nothing wrong with it.

Animations are the same. Very basic but they do what's needed.

Music is very nice! It's setting a great mood and sounds really high quality.

Voiceacting is also very good! It creates a fairytale feeling and progresses the story nicely.

Level design is very basic. It's not bad, but it feels even less advanced then the first metroid.

Upgrades are very lackluster. Extremly simplistic and/or pretty useless.

It's pretty short. You'll finish it in one sitting.



It's very noticeable this studio didn't have a huge budget but they polished what little they had into an ok little game. In the end I enjoyed myself while playing. Mostly because it's in VR. It's nice to see a classic metroidvania and I really hope they make more.","Jun 12, 2017 at 1:21 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 15:13:01.039150,Eulenauge66,A VR fairy tale,"8,- bucks for such a great game? You must be kidding. I love fairy tales, I love the old Castlevania and similar games, and VR makes it beautiful times ten. On the ""Hard"" level just right for me. The only thing which makes me a bit uncomfortable is standing on that platform above an abyss. But I forgot about that fast sucked in by the game. Don´t miss it!","Jun 9, 2017 at 3:29 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:13:01.059098,Hairboy,Lucky's Tale?,"This is a beautiful game, with some intriguing features (eg the level map on the walls around the diorama)

Essentially, it's a 2D game which doesn't utilise VR at all - you're staring straight ahead all the time at a hole in the wall.... but it's charming and well presented. If you're after ""VR"" games, then can probably give this a miss - Luckys Tale delivers a similar game style with the added benefit of being able to look around!","Jun 12, 2017 at 4:29 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 15:13:01.077049,Brad Neuberg,Great VR Platformer,"This game takes the excellent VR platforming of Lucky's Tale and wraps it into an engrossing fantasy story with heart. The graphics and level design are clever and well done, and the way the map ""wraps around"" where you are is smart. It's quite a large game, with many hidden areas and the ability to level up your character if you fully explore everything. This will provide you many hours of solid VR fun.","Jun 18, 2017 at 8:27 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 15:13:01.094018,Hornet_F4C,Beautiful Game!,"It's like an old-school castlevania style game for VR.

I for myself really like it. Nothing to complain! :-)","Jun 10, 2017 at 4:29 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:13:04.220641,Silasfelinus,Really charming so far,"There's just something rich and charming about this game. I'm only a short way in, so I can't speak to its sustainability, but it's a throwback to classic metroidvania combined with that feeling of playing those hologram games that hit arcades in the 90's.","Jun 9, 2017 at 2:56 PM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 15:13:04.253553,Dreeew84,OK,"The game looks nice but doesn't play very well. Feels like a mobile game and probably is fine for the GearVR but on PC the expectations are higher. The controls are floaty, don't expect any kind of exciting combat.  Exploration is fun though. Worth the little money they're asking for it but I'd love to pay more and get better gameplay.

I have always been a big fan of metroidvania type games. So to me, this game is great and easily worth 8$. I feel this game is a great example of what VR can add to 2.5D side scrollers. I really like the way the map is presented on the wall around the room your character is in. The gameplay is solid and fun. Although, (so far) nothing I haven't seen before after 25 years of gaming.  I'm hopeful that more games of this genre will be made for VR.","Jun 10, 2017 at 11:31 AM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 15:13:07.391161,Sedilis,Well worth the price.,"Great value game at the £6 price tag.  It took me about 6 hours play time to get to the final boss, though about 2 hours of that was back tracking looking for secret rooms containing extra skill and gear.  These semi-hidden skill books and xp shrines provide the RPG aspect involves you collecting more and better gear as you progress. 
 
The game has really nice graphics with an excellent art style. The story is a bit a cheesey *mild spoilers* as it sees you setting off to avenge your murdered father who’s last action was to pass down to you his spell book causing you to learn you’re a witch… erm Harryetta?  Setting that aside it's a fun platformer and a pleasure to play.  With only a few frustrating sections that’ll have you swearing at the game.","Jun 10, 2017 at 4:17 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:13:07.407118,neocaleric,Solid metroidvania gameplay.,"All the positive reviews are spot on. Great production quality overall. Gameplay, voices, graphics are real good, but it all feels enhanced by the VR framing. Great use of surrounding space to depict the map (this idea would be impossible in non-VR games from the same genre). For the price they are charging this little gem is a MUST HAVE.","Jun 11, 2017 at 2:01 AM",5, 1,
