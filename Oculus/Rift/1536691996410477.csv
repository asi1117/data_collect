2022-05-28 19:17:17.634627,plastic_rose,The Best Rollercoaster Experience,"Hands down. This is the best rollercoaster experience on here. The big open world environment makes you feel so small and the motion is very realistic, best when standing. Great soundtrack, would pay for further installments but doesn't seem to be any in the pipeline as this has been available for ages. Shout out to the developers, Great Job! Make a series. We will pay!","Nov 8, 2018 at 5:11 AM",5, 1,
