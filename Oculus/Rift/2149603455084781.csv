2022-05-28 19:38:45.362054,veesalazar,Good but Crashes,"I really liked this game but everytime i reach a certain spot it freezes and crashes, up until that it was really cute. Wish they would fix the bug so I can finish the game.","Apr 16, 2020 at 7:54 AM",2, 8,

2022-05-28 19:38:45.390977,james.edwards.5076,"Good game, but has issues.",Love the style and gameplay. However bugs in the game would cause me from being able to move or progress in the game.,"Mar 3, 2020 at 12:08 PM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 19:38:45.405937,Death2Savage,Awesome Game!,I love the graphics and style of this game. Defiinitely worth the download! I hope the developers finish the whole version soon! :),"Nov 5, 2019 at 3:22 AM",5, 17,
2022-05-28 19:38:48.524196,UmaNurmat,"What a great surprise, this is amazing!","Despite of the common flaws and understanding that is a student game...
This game has impressed me pleasantly. It has a very good feedback and makes shooting very comfortable. I love how it looks and the difficulty and learning curve is not bad at all.

Apparently it has some crashes and bugs but I'm pretty sure that they are working on it as it is an Early Access.

TL; DR: Amazing game, don't hesitate to try it!","Oct 15, 2019 at 3:44 AM",5, 9,

2022-05-28 19:38:48.554115,FastLawyer,It's a good free game by students,"This game was made by a group of university students in Spain. Yes, the game does have some problems. But you can get around those issues and it's actually pretty fun for what it is. The reason I'm giving this game 5 stars, is because of the negative reviewers (I would actually give it 3.5 stars). Here's my review & gameplay:

2022-05-28 19:38:48.569075,sammywaslow,"Good job, really involving action game!","Really a good job , to be honest it's very strange that is free to play with many levels increasing difficult in the right manner, very involving and attractive game, good job guys!","Mar 21, 2019 at 2:11 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:38:48.583545,firkinfedup,Couldn't play for long enough,"I tried it twice, and on both occasions it got into a state where I couldn't do anything.  First time after shooting the bombs, it wouldn't let me move anywhere after that.  Then the tobasco bomb disappeared through the floor and didn't re-spawn, meaning I couldn't blow up the barrels.  Seems like a cool game, but not very reliable.","Mar 3, 2019 at 10:42 PM",2, 1,

2022-05-28 19:38:51.716287,myrrh404,"Shows promise, please update soon!","I love the concept, but I too can't get past the third teleport location. What I saw of the graphics and music are great and on theme. I was hoping for more than three steps in, but what I saw was terrific. Please update to fix the teleport problem if more rooms/locations actually exist. Otherwise, add some. Yes! Liked it. Only three stars because there's only one area that I could reach. It would have been a two, but what I did see is really good. If the rest is eventually the same quality, it will be a five-star game. High hopes!","Oct 25, 2018 at 9:00 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 19:38:51.731248,Kzaar,Nice looking but broken,"Yes, it looks nice, but.  The game does not function.  Regardless of the number of times I have started, quit, and restarted I run into the same bugs.  In the general mode (reached by eating the burrito) or the tournament mode (drinking the tequila) the game stops progessing almost right away.  Playing the burrito level I can travel three teleport spaces and then I am unable to select the fourth.  In the tequila level I encounter the first wave of enemies and then no additional enemies show up.  Sure, I get it, this is early access but it feels as if this is so early that the train has just barely left the station.  You might want to wait on this one until the game gets to later revisions, hopefully by then it will be more than a tech demo.","Oct 20, 2018 at 6:26 PM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 19:38:51.748202,cots_xd,Kinda Broken,"Game looks nice, fun aspect; reminiscent of Dead and Buried. But it needs alot of work, it needs some music, and a shagne up in the sounds, i got bored after the first five minutes, it does need some elelments to spice the game up other than enimies hurling towards you.","Oct 23, 2018 at 6:09 PM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 19:38:51.764159,Junipersynth,Needs Some Work,"In concept, this is a very fun game. But the combination of the movement mechanic with a lack of orientation syncing means that after a few moves I'm completely turned around in my play space and have trouble fixing the direction I'm facing.","Oct 21, 2018 at 6:00 AM",2, 1,
