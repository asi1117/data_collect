2022-05-28 15:06:05.736935,makeralt,Really wanted to like this,"I don't have the fastest PC in the world, but it's fast but it seems not powerful enough to run this program.  It's crashed three times trying to start it, and the closest it got to running was so choppy and sluggish that it gave me a headache.",Apr 27 at 8:55 PM,1, 0,

2022-05-28 15:06:08.913440,nickladd,Great tool for Animators!,"I've been using AnimVR  for over a year as a beta tester and it's one of my favourite VR softwares. It's easy enough for people who are new to animation to enjoy, but also has enough depth for production-level work with a robust timeline and some fantastic export options.  I've used AnimVR to create assets for several small Unity games, short films and personal/professional projects.

The devs listen to user feedback and have been working towards this release for a long time.  Highly recommend!","Nov 9, 2018 at 4:40 AM",5, 76,
2022-05-28 15:06:08.928399,joedanimation,The next evolution of Animation,"AnimVR is the most production-ready tool for animating in VR, while creating a fun virtual space for the beginner to explore and experiment.  Great for hand-drawn animation, storyboards, character design, and previs.  Over the past 2 years I've used it on numerous personal and professional projects to deliver animation for both VR-based and traditionally-viewed animated projects.

Can't recommend it to you enough!","Nov 10, 2018 at 1:01 PM",5, 44,
2022-05-28 15:06:08.943359,dddrgl,Probably the future of animation,"It's still a little rough and experimental in places, but it's already a uniquely powerful animation tool, and getting better by the day. It's super easy to get the hang of compared to conventional 3D modelling/animation software, with a learning curve that's measured in minutes rather than weeks - but its real strength is that it's one of a very small number of tools that really do blur the lines between the expressiveness and improvisation of 2D animation and the power and flexibility of 3D animation. I don't know, why are you reading this, just give it a go :-)","Nov 10, 2018 at 9:06 PM",5, 28,
2022-05-28 15:06:08.958319,Timting,Touch controllers fixed,"Just bought this, but none of the menus seem to work properly with the touch controllers, the button assignments seem to be wrong... I'll wait a day or two and see if I can find more info, otherwise have to return it.

OK, tried again, the triggers on the controllers work, it's the buttons that are messed up, which means you can't control the timeline. Both the left and right (A and X) buttons seem to be assigned to the A button and the (B and Y) are both assigned to the B button, using the mic to switch assignments just moves both buttons to the other hand. The thumbsticks don't work at all. Right now this is unuseable...

Looking at their website, this appears to be a Vive port, so it may have just never been tested properly on the Oculus.

*** Still not working, reinstalled with no effect ***  Trying yet again, triggers have the same problem as the buttons, either one side or the other have both left and right activation for that position mapped to that controller. I tested several other apps today in case it was a hardware issue, but the rest all run perfectly with the touch controllers.

11/16/2018 - STILL not working (10.00.19) same problem.

11/21/2018 - Disabling the Oculus remote did NOT solve the problem, still doing exactly the same thing. I have over 100 games and apps and all of the rest of them work perfectly, so I don't think this is a hardware problem.

11/22/2018 - Finally able to try this out, liking it so far, though it is a bit basic at this point. The user interface needs more work for this to become a real animation tool, but if you made animated flip books as a kid, you will likely have the patience to enjoy this program.","Nov 23, 2018 at 1:07 PM",3, 9,
2022-05-28 15:06:08.973279,Chaser3D,Loved since beta.,"Been using this over on the steam playform for a while now and I adore it, Since it was still in beta I moved onto other programs to find they couldnt hold up to AnimVR's professional tools, allowing for flexibilty and fully lip synced animations, rather than simple loops. I look forward to this softwares futrure and the devs are super passionate and hard working of a 2 person team.
Good luck to them and give this tool a try!","Nov 12, 2018 at 11:41 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 15:06:12.089943,VRdaydream,This adds a new dimention to animation,It is a wonderful feeling to be transported into my drawings. As a 2d animator I spent a lot of time pretending to be in the world I was drawing and it used up a lot of mental energy. Now with ANIMVR I can spend less time envisioning and more time thinking about the performance. I am blown away with the timeline features and and how they made the interface simple to understand yet very powerful. I cannot recomend this software enough to any kind of animator.,"Nov 11, 2018 at 3:02 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 15:06:12.105900,Studio_Geppetto,What you need to animate!,"After using it since many months, I can assure you AnimVR improved my workflow and my creativity. The impressive timeline is surely for something! Also the nudge tool, easy layers and multiple import/export features is a must, and AnimVr has them.
The devs are really involved, they answer very quickly to our questions, and I'm sure they're already thinking about the next tools to please your animator heart.
I mainly use AnimVR now for storyboarding, the easy-to-use Unity interface,  and will use it for an incoming VR short-movie.
So, get it now !","Nov 12, 2018 at 11:14 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:06:12.120861,Ranimate,Animate in the best way possible,"AnimVR had confirmed to me that, 'Yup! this is what I have been waiting for.'
Once you get over the ""hurdle"" of understanding how to use the program, which there's not much to it, THANKS to the wonderful Tutorials Videos attached and help you can easily get online.
I have been using AnimVR for about five months now (Beta Version) for different purposes.
If you are looking to create Storyboards, Animatics, Character Sketch, Character and Environment Design, Character Animation and more, in a fluid and/or Artistic way? Definitely get your hands on AnimVR. 
If you search the definition of - 'Highly Recommend.' You will probably find my picture, pointing at - AnimVR Icon.","Nov 15, 2018 at 12:54 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:06:12.135821,andydv,love the interface and intuitive design,"i pretty much purchased a rift solely for the prospect of VR illustration and animating. I love AnimVR's interface and controls, I found them to be instantly intuitive and comfortable, unlike some other drawing/animation apps. I am still trying to get comfortable drawing in VR, and realize the artform itself is more or less in its infancy, so it's an exciting time to be part of a rapidly growing community of artists. I hope the devs continue to grow and support this product!","Nov 13, 2018 at 10:16 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:06:12.150781,godannyboy,First Impression - Frustrating,"So I've spent my first two hours in the game trying to figure out the UI. Not sure what that says about me, but seems like the controls could be far more intuitive. Not really a fan of the primary secondary controller scheme they've got going on. Quill's UI is much easier to navigate. And why everytime I select a new brush it advances to a new frame?! Bug or maybe I'm doing something wrong... I'll be spending much more time in this program in the following weeks, hope that things get easier as I go.","Nov 12, 2018 at 10:43 AM",3, 2,"Thanks for the feedback on the UI.
The issue you ran into is fixed (ver. 10.00.22) - just update in Oculus home. It was an issue where button mappings would get mixed up if an Oculus Remote or Xbox controller is connected."

EDIT : Sorry, but it still doesn't work with the last update. (But the Beta worked with steam)

EDIT 2 : After 2 weeks, it still doesn't work....","Nov 30, 2018 at 12:39 AM",1, 12,
