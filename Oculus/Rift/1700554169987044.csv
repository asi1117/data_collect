While the graphics and length of the game are improved (~30 minutes), the gameplay & controls are worse. This game has the same clunky controls as the first, except they took away smooth turning and you still have the same gaze-based interactions. The new gameplay elements are basically just key hunting and finding the correct path (or hope you don't go around in circles). And the jumpscares just aren't as good as the first.

Here is my Let's Play full gameplay with commentary: https://youtu.be/sWKdzKTADPo","Jun 18, 2019 at 7:01 AM",2, 3,

Oh wait, you have a hand... a tiny little mouse hand that you're not sure what to do with it. The graphics are crap. The only horror about this game is that I spent 5 bucks.","Oct 5, 2018 at 9:27 AM",1, 3,

I had to work out how to get into the church, but with the beautiful graphics and music I didn't mind. And no, I didn't have to fake all the screaming. Keep in mind my video is one hundred times brighten than the actual game. https://youtu.be/cO3-8XIKTp8","Mar 15, 2018 at 1:44 PM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 18:24:03.678291,D3Duck,"Pretty good VR horror game, but short...","It's a decent horror experience (hardly could call it a game). It has very simple animations, pretty good overall graphics, and ambience is dark (very dark lighting) and music is very well done for a creepy atmosphere.  The controls are wonky and way too simple, so it's not good with motion controls, except for the flashlight/torch moves well with motion controller...better over all moving in the world with a game controller though. 
The game is short (I didn't time it, but it felt like maybe 40 minutes). Picking up stuff is awkward and jenky, and the movement to go forward is at a snails pace (I'm used to Dreadhalls that is a much better game with great controls, animations, atmosphere, dynamically made halls/corridors, etc, so it's a night and day difference).  

I'm mostly ok with getting this experience at the sale price of about half off., but I would not want to pay  full price.. It's hard to consider it worth it...again, especially when compared with Dreadhalls.","May 27, 2018 at 2:07 PM",3, 3,
