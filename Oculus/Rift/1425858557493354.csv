For the game itself, it is fun. The mechinics can be a little daunting to get the hang of but the concept is fun and a great workout. I'm sure with practice I'll get good at it but for now it is fun trying.","Mar 25, 2021 at 6:48 AM",5, 10,

Looking at this game critically, I say that it is a perfect concept for a vr racing game, rather than being stuck in a vehicle, you are the vehicle. The mix of Mariokart esque power ups and the movement of Jet Set Radio Future blend incredbly well and lend themselves to a unique experience! That being said however, for any new player it will take a few days to grasp the running mechanic, but once you do you'll be in for the time of your life. My final note is, unfortunantely due the current state of VR, online mulitiplayer is lacking, however this isn't to fault Survios, because they put out an amazing game with immense replayability and a sizeable amount of content for the price. Sprint Vector is a solid game with loads of content and should be a mainstay for any VR user.","Dec 27, 2020 at 12:39 PM",5, 23,

Also lots of movement mechanics so the skillcap is very high.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer is dead and didn't really work great even when it wasn't.  Add to that the AI isn't very good and there's no Mario Kart style ""cups"" where you get a total score across multiple races, so the single player is also lacking.

The devs have obviously put in a lot of thought and care into this game.  The way that the controls are used makes it require considerable skill to play, and so progress is very satisfying.  I expect it will take me ages before I get even half competent.  And I can actually get some (much needed) exercise from playing a computer game; who'd have thought it? The only negative at the moment is that I haven't been able to find any online games in my region (EU).  But I've only tried twice, so that could be bad timing, or me doing something wrong.
UPDATE:  Had this for a good while now, and still think it's an excellent game.  However, I am very rarely able to find anyone else playing online (EU or US), so if that's your thing then it's a problem.","Nov 16, 2018 at 6:28 PM",5, 16,

I've done about 10 races and everytime I've gotten stuck on something stupid.  Usually when I get stuck on something it takes about 15-30 seconds to get out.  Moving in all directions, jumping, etc. Costing that much time in a race makes it nearly impossible to win.  A couple races my character was just completely stuck and I had to quit the race.

(I recomand switch off braking, because during sprint are those buttons pressed by mistake),...but is not possible in settings make some more changes. Would be one result - if in setting menu will more modification for  Oculus Touch controls, because this one who projected buttons probably never play longer time by Oculus. Realy terrible playing. Same problems is turning buttons - you are running and by mistake lite touch...and all is lost.

Besides the ""free weekend"" which led me to this purchase. I have done nothing but try to find others to play with.

stupid Rift has segregated the online community into their own proprietary community, but it is broken. Because there is never anyone else to play with.

I hate wasting money on game after game only to find out it is a dead game like every game on Rift.

2022-05-28 13:54:39.459051,Arguyle,Great game,"Inspired by the Mario Kart and the Wipeout series, this new VR gem will make you sweat to the last drop if you really want to win. Great workout. Great tracks. Vibrant colours. But technically a bit difficult to master especially on the harder tracks. The racing mechanics are good but to make this an excellent game it would have to be more fluid. For example, in Mario Kart and Wipeout you need to master the optimal racing line on the tracks, and the racing mechanics definitely allows you to master them. In Sprint Vector, there are so many moving objects, pitfalls and roadblocks and the races are too long for an amateur player to really master a track. Also the, number of traps and pitfalls to dodge or avoid keeps you distracted from beating your opponents, and make the weapons a bit useless. Therefore, it skews the game intention of being a ""racing"" game to more of an arm bashing fest. Suggestion if not already implemented: Add a reset button to avoid all the pain of getting back on track when you're stuck.","Apr 8, 2018 at 1:22 AM",4, 10,

But for the love of all that is sacred can the devs PLEASE make it so you can disable the Oculus home button? It ruins so many races for me.

2022-05-28 13:54:45.954345,00DALTON,Amazing! Completely recommend!,"This is a fanstastic racing game that has locomotion mechanics that I can only compare them to skiing. You skate about, racing your fellow players in various environments (volcanic maps to arctic, snowy maps etc.) to be the first to reach the finish line. The game can be compared to Mario Kart, in that there are power-ups that are littered around the map so that you can still stand a chance if you are lagging in 8th (last) place.

I only have 2 critisims: there plenty of maps but they can be covered within the first few hours and the other is that I wish that there was a way of customising your skates (giving them more speed, but less control-ability or better drift, but worse in-air control, etc.).

2022-05-28 13:54:45.977284,evertec,Great!,"I love the attention that Survios put into getting the controls right. It's not as easy to pick up as something like Mario Kart, but once you finally learn the controls, it has a lot more depth to the game. 

I'm sure there will be a lot of players that will skip over the tutorials and start a race, only swinging their arms as fast as they could. While this is a decent workout, do yourself a favor and go through ALL the tutorials (not just the first one). Once you master the controls, you'll be flinging yourself accross the maps with a level of control and pure joy only super heros have. This is when the game really gets fun. 

The reason why motion control games on the Xbox Kinect and Wii never did well is because they weren't predictible enough to really spend a long time mastering (remember how most people cheated with the wii and just shook the controller instead of swinging it?). I'm happy to say Sprint Vector (along with many other excellent VR titles) have finally broken this mold and have created a game that has the predictibility in controls that all sports (and sport games) must have. This is truly a game that you can have fun playing from the beginning, but will also stretch your competitive side as there's so much room for growth in getting better.

2022-05-28 13:54:55.413791,McNabb,"Excellent, when the controls work","When the controls respond as they are supposed to, it's great. The first time I ran a couple of races, my biceps burned for two days, I loved it. The big problem is, the controls often don't do what you want, and the game is overly punitive when punishing mistakes. In the air, you should be able to fly: sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Those green walls? At the top you should be able to pull yourself up / jump up. Sometimes you can, sometimes you can't. You should be able to look the direction you want to go. That often has you sliding to the side, with no grip to change direction and crashing into a wall, and there is also no way that I can find to reset your position. You just have to finagle your way back on to the track, while everyone else shoots past you. There also doesn't appear to be a way to simply forfeit or restart a race; you have to struggle on or quit the app entirely. I never rage quit games, especially not VR games, but this one I've rage quit many times; it can be so unresponsive and so unfair and so punishing it's just not fun. When the controls respond, it's great and an astounding workout. When they don't, not so much. One other thing, they explicitly state you should not press the lower triggers as that will cause you to brake. That's a hard thing to avoid in the heat of a race.


UPDATE: It has now started doing a thing where the gloves on my hands will crackle with energy, and when that happens I can only run backwards (facing forwards but moving backwards). The thing is, it never goes away. Everyone else is at the finish line, and I'm only halfway done because I can't run forwards.

It does such a great job at moving you around at high speeds with a really in-depth locomotion system that I'd love to see used in all kinds of other games. It's a step forward for VR, and may be one of those locomotion systems that becomes common over time with more games adapting it, like what I feel Lone Echo / Echo Arena achieved with Zero G movement.

I won't parrot the same positives that others have mentioned. The only negative I could think is that, while it touts 12 maps to race on, there are really only 6 maps, and 6 in reverse (with some added obstacles), and all of this takes place over 3 different worlds/settings (ice, desert, factory). It's such an amazing mechanic that it leaves you wanting way more variety in levels than what is offered. Challenges are super fun and will keep you going for hours though. Still, for the $30 price tag that they're asking, it's a hell of a value. Hoping they release new maps, even if it's paid DLC. I'm hooked!","Feb 11, 2018 at 5:50 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 13:54:58.655724,Bleach-Hell,New Favorite Racing Game,"As a fan of Mario Kart, I love exhilirating, fast, multiplayer racing games. This feels like a combination of that, Jet Set Radio, and a VR parkour experience. 

It controls very well, but you might not feel like it at first; they definitely have a learning curve. It wasn't until my first few days after playing that I felt like I had an insane amount of control, and now I'm getting first place in most of my matches.

The power ups are useful, but don't feel unfair like blue shells in Mario Kart. The maps are better than Mario Kart as well, in my opinion. They're not as linear as most maps in racing games; there are a ton of secret passages, not just one alternate path.

This is also one of the most polished experiences, if not the most, that I've had in VR. At the price, it's worth it by far. The graphics are beautiful, the music is fantastic, and it controls very nice with no motion sickness. Expect a workout (my body was aching after the first few days), but you quickly get used to it. I can play longer than ever before without the fatigue that I used to get, and I'm not in shape by any meaning of the word (skinny, but not active).

I bought VR a few weeks ago, and I bought this game on release a few days after receiving my headset. Being new to VR, this is by far one of my favorite games, and I can't stop coming back to it. Definitely pick it up if you're considering it, and are a fan of Mario Kart + don't mind being a little more active than you're probably used to.","Feb 22, 2018 at 10:29 AM",5, 3,

I'm usually really sensitive to any motion in vr, and so I condemn myself to standing experiences. But this is something different, it feels great. I guess they gonna have hard time convincing people like me it's not going to kill them... It is also great workout, I really feel tired after few rounds. Controls are very extraordinary, and when first time I saw it I though  it doesn't look (feels) right at all. But I give it a try, and a few more... And it does feel real, after your body gets the hang of it. Graphics are great, love the character arts. Part of intro of this game looks like ""link start(o)"" from SAO.

-the racer controlles realy bad, turning in this game is hard and unintuitiv

-you are constantly airbourne and then can bearly control your movement

Update - weapons need a major rework. They reward who ever is in first and punish everyone that is grouped up. This game needs something like the mario kart blue shell to actually make the race interesting instead of rewarding the player in first way ahead of everyone else.

After playing all the tutorials (basic, advanced, expert) and racing against AI on 2 tracks, there is still something that push me against it.

You can skate, jump, double jump, turn, fly, brake, brake in the air, drift, adjust your drifting angle, shoot, grab boosters, climb, hang. And when I say you can do all of this, it's more like you have to. The game with just skating, braking, jumping and drifting would have been great, maybe more like a ""futuristic"" skiing game...

Controls/locomotion are great,genuine skill is involved and you will still be improving your technique and subsequently your best times week and months from now(especially as you'll get fitter the more you practice)
After a few races you'll be sweating buckets but at least you'll have a smile on your face(heaps more fun than running on a treadmill).
Probably the best VR only game I've played and well worth the relativley cheap price.
