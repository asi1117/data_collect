2022-05-28 17:46:16.597919,DotaPhOeNix,5 stars experience,"one of the most exhilarating games I have ever played. it is a combination of the Da Vinci Code and Indiana Jones. I am brand new to VR games, this one is very realistic, and the graphic is top-notch. 

You get addicted to it and you will have the urge to finish it to know what is going to be next. if you love mystery with a hint of horror this is the game!",14 days ago,5, 0,
2022-05-28 17:46:16.612879,FlashBarStud,Must have for any VR user,"I really couldn't stop playing this, it draws you in always wanting more. Classic resi style puzzles, amazing graphics and very clever how it gets you to interact with the objects around you. It's not an open exlore game but it really doesn't need to be, sit back and enjoy hours of fun! Highly recommended, no spoilers but the last room spooked me out, definitely my favourite!",Jan 2 at 5:01 AM,5, 32,
2022-05-28 17:46:16.627839,maverick767,Great game!,I'm a 30 year PC and console gamer.. just got my first VR headset with a Quest 2... This game is really good. My girlfriend and I played it simultaneously on seperate Quest 2's. She is not a very experienced gamer but she loves escape rooms and she loved this game. We had a really good time talking thru puzzles and how we had each figured them out... plus we were able to give each other subtle hints a couple times when we got hung up.  The Room VR is a great game.. I hope they make a sequel soon.,Jan 19 at 11:16 AM,5, 6,

There are no points in the game where you're made to jump or be scared, just an eerie atmosphere sometimes.

When playing the mobile games my feeling was ""this has to be for VR!"" Fireproof Studios deliver quality here as on the other platforms. Can't wait to get another installement.
Sometimes, VR hands feel a bit clunky and there are some actions that work on mobile, but haven't been implemented here. Like combining items in the inventory or manipulating items in inventory. 
Doesn't bother me that much. Loved the puzzles. Loved the scenerie. Graphics and sound are great!

I played The Room series on andriod a couple of years ago and at the time I was a bit disappointed to hear their next title would be VR. However, two years later with a PC and VR headset I see exactly why they made that decision, this style of game lends itself to very well to VR. 
I wouldn't normally have parted with £20+ for a VR title, but it was well worth it.
I look forward to their next release.

Free movement and smooth turning would be nice in the future.","Feb 19, 2021 at 5:37 PM",5, 7,

I however feel you should play the 'The Room' games in the app store on your mobile device. This game is the ending and a wonderful bridge to the games.

2022-05-28 17:46:41.810485,eric.glandon,amazing,ok so I started out playing these games on mobile and absolutely loved them. Having this game come out in VR just blew my mind. Game play was pretty easy to get the hang of and the ability to move the angle of view of what you are looking at brings a whole new level to the game. While I am a little sad that it only took me two days of play to finish the game I absolutely loved it and cant wait for more to be released.

There is also a way to get hints. Not answers; HINTS. There are three hints possible to give, and each one gets more detailed. I used it a few times, and all but one was because I didn't see something specific in the room or just let me know I was on the right track. It's very helpful.

2022-05-28 17:46:48.089690,Sub7th,Terrific Adventure,"This is almost everything yhou wished a point and click adventure could be.
The puzzles are very logical and not ridiculously hard or illogical;
Look for clues, manipulate things and see what happens, put the thing in the thing shaped hole, etc.
There are a couple of new mechanics that are used really well.
Tricky enough to steal 6-7 hours of your time, but reasonable enough to leave hints off.
Also, having hints on, doesn't make them auto pop-up which is nice. You need to actively pull a tab in your inventory to see them.
I only used one when I got stuck for quite a while because I didn't realize I could manipulate something. Other than that I was able to figure most stuff out by looking around for clues and just playing with the objects.
While there isn't really a whole lot of story, there's just enough I suppose.

Really fun, great atrmosphere.
Played the whole thing in a comfy chair and had no issues.
Works well sitting or standing.
I really hope we see more of this genre in VR.
And I would definitely pay for another Room game.","Nov 15, 2020 at 12:15 AM",5, 1,

It adds such realism to The Room.. having to turn your head to look at what's on the wall... etc... it's great. The graphics are fantastic.

Everything just feels right, and gets bigger and cooler as the story progresses so there's never a dull moment. The use of VR is also spot on, I haven't had this much fun in a headset in a really long time.

I felt satisfied by the ending). If you haven't played anything in the franchise before, that's fine. It definitely doesn't require playing the others, though I highly recommend them all! One of the most satisfying games I have ever played in VR.

Even though I liked the conclusion, I would like to be clear that if Fireproof Games decided to make another game, I would be overjoyed. Such incredible atmosphere and storytelling. I'm sad I don't have another to play right now. :)","Sep 1, 2020 at 5:16 AM",5, 2,

The graphics are really pretty with so much attention to detail, the puzzles are interesting but not completely obscure, and the sense of atmosphere it creates is haunting.

2022-05-28 17:46:57.598258,hotsurlysoup,Incredible. Must play.,"I will say right off the bat that I am a fan of The Room series of puzzle games. I find the puzzles very satisfying and the atmosphere immersive. Both of these positives are magnified 1000x in VR.

As someone who has logged at least 100 hours in VR this game still did a great job of making me feel like I was in a tangible place, even without freedom of movement. I believe this might be the game's greatest strength. Because there is no movement I'd be willing to bet that this would be a great title for VR beginners, while still showcasing the sense of place and immersion that makes the medium so incredible.

So when I saw that they made The Room VR I was so excited that I bought it before I even got my VR setup (Quest 2). I was NOT disappointed. The only complaint I have isn't even about the game/experience, but the fact that I started playing the Quest version, then switched over to the PC VR version for better graphics and the save didn't transfer over. So I had to run through everything I had already done. But I honestly don't care because the game is such a great time.

So I was very excited for the first VR adaption. And I am just blown away. This is what VR is meant to be like.

Finally fully emerging into the universe of the null-element. Fantastic graphics, tricky puzzles to solve, the controls with the Ocuculs motion controllers are just so good, so intuitive, so precise. A must-have, worth every penny. Just played the first 2 levels, hope there are as many as in the mobile phone games and the fun won't stop too soon.

Only one thing: Please fix the issue that when teleporting the direction of view stays the same as the starting point. It would be much better to have a default view at each spawn point directly pointing the player to the puzzle or thing of interest.","Mar 27, 2020 at 5:06 AM",5, 63,

It's another lovely blend of well judged and smart puzzles that err on just the right side of head scratching to give the 'I'm a genius!' or 'Durrr.. That was so obvious!' effect just about every time. 
It translates to VR perfectly with the assorted interactivity required with the various doodbabs and general pokey twisty puzzles. 

It's not amazingly long but isn't brutally priced either. Was pleasantly surprised to see it on the Quest as well so cross buy bonus if that's a swing factor for you.

The graphics are fantastic, with some areas feeling huge and imposing to dramatic and even homely, with a some creepy effects to enhance them.

The sounds and music will remind experienced players of the room but also add so much depth giving to the environments  (trying not to say anything to give spoilers here).

I agree with some of the other reviews suggesting the ability to walk around the environments but adding perhaps obvious areas on the floor where you know a puzzle will take place when you get close to one ?

Also perhaps have a 'hard' mode where there are more puzzles added in for those who want a deeper challenge and keep a 'normal' mode to appeal to the wider audience.

I loved it, wished it went on and on, I am already really looking forward to the next one.  Perhaps continuing with the character and learning more of the lore of ""The Room"" ...","Aug 25, 2020 at 4:25 PM",5, 0,

Didnt even mean it in ""that"" way. The way that a Karen would  get angry at. I did the last bit right now on a cannabis gummy. That was too scary. It was far too real. I just googled how to spell ""real"" by spelling real
in a google search. 

Proudly so, I have never been confused about the differences between there, their, and they're. My nose is pointed up as I'm saying this.

For a second I thought there was a frosted mini-wheat with a cartoon face on it on my box of Frosted Mini-Wheats. Turns out there really is. 

I really enjoyed the game. I do wish it was longer and harder. In the non-phallic way. The glues were fairly. Hahaha clues is what I meant. The glues are truly fine. Sorry for slandering you, glue. The clues or puzzles were easy to figure out. But I iamgine VR is so different. But I'm not invested in the rest of this paragraph. I can't keep my mind pointed at the screen. My mind is like a floating magnet that you have to focus on keeping straight up or it will fall over. 

First time being high I was at my friends house like 6 months ago. As I was and am over the leagal age to be able to partake in such things, and he gave me a gummy. And all I remember from that night was this conversation with his wife. 
Friends Very Pregnant Wife: I cant wait to go back to the gym. But we have to wait until the baby is 1 years old to be able to go at the childcare secting of the Gym.
Super High Me: What? Why! You should go right away and drop her off after 3 months
Friends VP Wife: They won't allow child under 1 years old

They have the right formula for creating amazing puzzle games, and they've unlocked that formula now in VR. You will not be disappointed. Flawless graphics, perfect soundtrack, great level of difficulty. I'm all over this! I can't wait for their next episode. Meanwhile, I'll be going through this one again!!","Apr 11, 2020 at 11:22 PM",5, 0,

If you like the other titles, you will almost certainly like this game. The controls for the Glass viewer on/off didnt agree with me too much, but it wasnt anything that ruined the game. Fairly difficult, and certainly immersive. A+++ Title","Apr 10, 2020 at 2:09 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 17:47:29.071079,Maelstromxl,Does not disappoint!,"I have been a big fan of the mobile The Room games and am a huge fan of this entry into VR.  No puzzles are so difficult that will cause you to walk away from the game.  There are no jump scares, timed events, or quick reflex actions required.  What this game has is an abundance of eeiry atmostphere (a staple of all previous The Room games) and exceptional puzzle mechanics and environment.  You may have to use a hint here and there but by no means will you ever get stuck or frustrated.  As with all VR games, I wish it had a longer playing experience but I am absolutely pleased with the polish and presentation of this game.  This is the gold standard for immersion, escape rooms, and VR technology.  Can not recommend this game enough.","Mar 28, 2020 at 11:03 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:47:29.088034,jedwards123321,The PERFECT game for MY tastes.,"I REALLY enjoyed this game, playing it to completion!  I'm a computer graphics artist/programmer and I mostly ""play"" games to admire/examine their implementation and craftsmanship.  Finishing ANY computer game, either VR or 2D on a PC/Xbox, is VERY rare for me so the fact I actually completed this game is quite a recommendation from me.  I completed it in under 7 hours and did it without activating the ""clues"" option or otherwise getting any help.  I generally very much DISlike FPS and gravitate much more to the puzzle/mystery/open-world type games.  The puzzles in this game were just the right level of challenge -- they were not overly technical or computationally taxing or otherwise mentally onerous. Rather, like all truly good puzzles, they mostly came down to being observant and being able to step back and think outside the box.  The game has beautiful graphics and ran without any problems whatsoever.  HIGHLY recommended for those who like non-FPS games.  THANKS!","Apr 8, 2020 at 8:14 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 17:47:29.103991,Choo_hehimlvl3,Exactly what I had hoped!,"This was my first experience with ""The Room"" series, and it was a great one! 
 Though the video gives you a small taste, I wasn't anticipating how dense the UI was with puzzles, many of them interlocking and building on one another.  I was able to get through with 1 clue, and when I pulled that clue I almost smacked myself in the forehead.  The failing was in my thinking, and the game had given me every chance to succeed, but I didn't realize it until I pulled that clue!

To me, that says great design.

In the end my only complaint was that bringing up my inventory broke my immersion a bit, especially to activate my eyepiece.  Two things I feel would improve this experience:

1>  Simply ask us to tap the side of our VR Headset with a finger.  It could trigger the lens when our hand gets close enough, so no real tap is needed, and would have felt smooth.

2> Have a virtual 'bag' that we can pull up from over our shoulder (hip is bad for seated gameplay) with a grab, like Saints and Sinners.  That way we feel like we're interacting with something in the world.  Make the current inventory an option for accessibility.


Overall, a fantastic experience, and I'm really looking forward to more in the future!  Maybe a.... MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE!  :o

All of the clues are there and the is no guess work required to solve the puzzles. There is a hint system if you get really stuck, but use as an absolute last resort. The graphics are stunning. The controls are intuative, the movement is slick and comfortable. This is how to make a VR game.","Apr 7, 2020 at 5:51 AM",5, 0,

The game flowed so smoothly in VR that the hour I scheduled for play stretched quickly into 3 hours with nary a blink. There were several different types of puzzles, but the puzzles that involved the interplay with scale were most intriguing. Such puzzles take advantage of VR in an imaginative way. That is, you not only look at an old organ, play the organ, but jump inside the organ... to fix the pipes. Very clever.

The graphics are beautiful. Wished for more story. That said, I found this VR puzzle game immensely enjoyable!","Apr 8, 2020 at 2:14 AM",5, 0,

Puzzles were challenging and entertaining without being absurdly difficult or outlandish.  I was able to solve them all without resorting to hints, but they are conveniently available so I would assume any type of player would be able to enjoy the game flow.  I was a bit surprised that the relative level of puzzle difficulty vascillated from easy to hard to easy again as you progressed through levels, as opposed to just becoming harder. It was also very nice that you can play this game either seated or standing and not affect the gameplay (seated was great because you can be playing for several hours beginning to end).

This game truly is the next evolution in The Room saga and feels extremely immersive.

2022-05-28 17:47:35.358263,JamesMcCullough219,Fantastic installment in the series!,"Having played all 4 The Room games on mobile, I was imidietly intriuged by the announcement of an entry for VR. The atmosphere that I'd so loved on mobile and the detailed puzzle box / escape room puzzles should work brilliantly in VR! Let me start by saying I was in no way dissapointed.

Everything I loved about the first three games, from the eyepiece effects (even including it's additional features from The Room 3 where you shrink down into mechanisms) translate brilliantly into VR, and are even improved upon. The shrinking down into mechanisms is done better than ever before, where you'll solve puzzles from both inside and outside mechanisms.

Speaking of the puzzles, they're back and as brilliant as ever, where there's always enough to guide you forward and if you're ever feeling lost, the subtle multi-tier hints system really helps give you a nudge in the right direction without telling you the answer. Especially given these are some of the most complicated 'rooms' we've ever been placed in, this helpful directional pointer is as appriciated now as it ever was.

Previous 'The Room' fans will not be dissapointed, as this game is jam packed full of story, mechanics and references to the other games, though implimented in such a way that new users to this game won't feel alionated. Knowladge of prior games is never tested or required, but some threads from these are drawn to a close here in a satisfying way, though no doubt the ending will be just as satisfying for those playing only this entry.

The teleportation system is a brilliant way of navigating the room and drawing the user's attention to the useful areas, and while I do miss the gradual sweeping of movement from the room's 2 to 4, I can see how this could have been unconfortable in VR, so even that element isn't displeasing and while a departure, works great in this game.

I would love to see more The Room in VR! Would strongly reccomend for puzzle fans and 'Room' fans alike!","Apr 3, 2020 at 11:58 PM",5, 0,

Only twice did I need I need a hint to solve, and then only the first of 3 hints provided. So if you are impatient with puzzles, it does not hinder your enjoyement of the rest of the game, which is really mind blowing. 
     The mind blowing part includes the best graphics, animations, and sounds that create an erie atmospheric embience that totally encompasses you like a VR game should do. 
     I would have enjoyed exploring the environements a little more freely, but the teleportation method puts you right in front of the puzzles you need to solve, so that mechanic did little to detract from the experience.

2022-05-28 17:47:38.566682,DuraMorte,Excellent! Well worth the purchase.,"A lot of the negative reviews of this title complain about the length.
Something to understand about VR titles, in my opinion, is the shorter length compared to standard games.
This title hits the sweet spot of being long enough to sink one's teeth into, without overstaying it's welcome. The puzzles are fun and interesting, with a real sense of accomplishment when you figure them out. The hint system is very well-done, providing a little push in the right direction, or a much more specific hint if you're still stuck.

There was one small glitch about 2/3 way through, involving a door that didn't open properly, but returning to the main menu and re-entering the save fixed it.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this game, and I'm happy with the purchase. Considering the price of two trips to the movie theater, the price-to-length ratio is perfectly in line with my expectations of a VR game.

Thanks, devs, for your hard work! Looking forward to the next one!","Mar 31, 2020 at 8:52 AM",5, 0,

It finally happened and Fireproof games did NOT disappoint!

A strong recommendation to play this game!

The only nitpicking I have about the game is that you will turn your ""Lens"" on and off a lot of times, you do this but opening your Inventory and then switching the lens on and off.

2022-05-28 17:47:41.697309,elshagan,I hope for a sequel,"I loved the previous Room games and this one did not disappoint.

* Graphics, the art style works really well in VR where you can truly appreciate the painstaking detail that the devs put into their environment and puzzles.

* Gameplay, I'll say what I thought since playing the first The Room game... It would work amazing in VR and this one did not disappoint, the teleportation movment is similar to how it works in previous games. Generally not my cup of tea, but I don't mind it in this game as it's more about solving the puzzles not moving and shooting.

* Puzzles, no complaints, might been a bit easy but I chalk it down to having played all the other The Room games and understanding what to expect, but they were still causing head scratches in certain parts. But it was always satisfying to find the solution. I do wish there'd been more puzzle boxes akin to the original The Room game on the phone, mostly because I feel the move to VR would really open up the ability to have them. The ability to touch, move, twist and turn, inspect the puzzles would make it even better.

* Verdict, 10/5 I love the atmosphere of the games and it works well in VR, specially in the final part... Quite creepy... I will say the pages were a nice touch along with the iconic eyepiece. I do severely hope the Devs intend for a sequel or another VR Room game, while VR is kind of niche this style of game is really fitting for the media and allows for such creativity with the puzzles. Highly recommended despite the pricy, price tag. This will surely be a game I'll use to Demo VR for friends and family.","Apr 4, 2020 at 3:13 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 17:47:57.500042,seantheman,Excellent Puzzle game.,"I've played The Room 1,2,3 on Steam so I have been looking forward to this for a while.

The puzzles and ideas are quite similar to the previous games, yet this requires you to interact and move around the environment instead of just 1 box.

Where you can move to is clearly marked and it's via teleportation. This is extremely useful as it stops you from guessing what you would have to do and instead you are aware of where you need to go or where the answer may lay.

It is definitely worth the money and I would encourage anyone who likes puzzles or escape rooms to give this a go.

Hints are available if needed, and I definitely had to use 1 or 2 on the Third chapter. I knew what I needed to do but the device/way to do it was very obscure and I didn't notice it. 

The biggest compliment I can give the game is that I won't play it all in one go as I will have nothing to look forward to. I'm taking it 1 chaper per day as I want to drag out my experience .
The issue with the Room games though is replayability, you will need to leave it for a year or so and forget the ways to solve the puzzles before playing again.","Mar 29, 2020 at 8:15 PM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 17:48:00.654605,Jasagna,They've done it again!,"Once again, Fireproof Games shows they are a AAA studio. As a huge fan of th the Room series, and yes it's a bit short and pricey, this simply is the best of it's VR escape room game that I've played (with Form coming up in second place).
Can't wait for the next installment.

2022-05-28 17:48:03.738357,jmzwiv,Does not disappoint,"Only one chapter in, but love the series and this doesn't disappoint. The story and puzzles and general mood of the game seem great.

Only concern is the VR experience was a tiny bit uncomfortable at times. I don't think it's the fault of the mechanics of the game though, maybe frame rate on my 980ti?. 

It would be great if there was a better way for spectators to follow along. My wife found it too unconfortable to watch (due to the view point moving with my head motion).","Mar 29, 2020 at 6:35 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 17:48:03.755311,klarkent91,Well... easily the best game on Quest,"I have played numerous games on Quest and up to this game... I had other favorites but of course this one beats them all! I've been big fan of the mobile games but never I would have expected them to release something on VR. Found out some days ago and then I immediately bought the game as soon as it was available. I completed the game in less than two days, so one could say it's a bit short but it is very polished and the graphics and story are very well designed. I will be eagerly waiting for the next VR chapter!","Mar 30, 2020 at 12:57 AM",5, 0,
