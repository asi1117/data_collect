2022-05-28 21:02:51.850858,Overlord-Dirge,Choppy image and no sound on a 2080ti,"This game cannot be played. It's super choppy and there's no sound coming through my headset at all. I'm running a 2080ti with more than sufficient amount of ram and a great cpu. I'm doing it through the Quest 2 via Oculus Link. I can run Half Life Alyx on maxed out specs with absolutely no lag or tear, so this game shouldn't have any issues running at all. Was really looking forward to finally trying this too. I think I'm well past the date that I can get a refund, really wish I would've tried it much sooner :(","Jan 11, 2021 at 1:13 PM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 21:02:51.865818,kf2010,"Creepy, but lacks depth","I am about to finish this game, and while it is creepy, there appears to be little rhyme or reason for the scares and creepiness except just for creepiness for its own sake. The story is light. The puzzles are light. Yeah, ""walking experience in a random haunted house while searching for items"" is what best describes the game.
I give it a 3 out of 5. I kind of enjoyed it, but not too much.

By the way, there are also some technical issues like when the items are engaged and won't move. I hope they fix those glitches. People who play this will hopefully know what I am referring to.","Dec 2, 2020 at 9:19 PM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 21:02:51.881775,HacXander,Pretty decent.,"Its a pretty good port. The letest update also fixed my technical issues, altough it still lags from time to time, and the scaling of the world is a bit off.","Jun 19, 2020 at 12:51 PM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 21:02:51.896735,diemensionx,ok,"played the none vr version before, much the same in VR, did find the black levels a bit odd compared to other games, just didnt give the feel of a dark mansion, more grey  than black no matter what brightness setting I used. Still a good game just not scary enough due to the lighting for me. Rift S.","Feb 28, 2020 at 3:55 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 21:02:51.911695,ron.labbe,Solid mix of art and haunted house,"Lots and lots of doors to go through with plenty of surprises and excellent graphics. Some serious work went into this... don't miss the portraits of the developers in the little book at the end! (Getting around and the drunk effects made for some slight headache, but tolerable is short doses)","Feb 8, 2020 at 5:49 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 21:02:55.014396,paulohotline,Layers of Fears is released in VR!,"I finished this game in pancake mode with headphones and definitely pooped my pants at least once. The game was gripping, I am currently downloading the VR game and am dreading going back to the sick twisted mind of The Painter. Oh crap, what did I get myself into to? Will update after I scared myself to death or a couple of hours, whichever comes first :) UPDATE: Oh man, I have one headphone off the ear so I don't completely freak out. The game is exactly like the pancake version, very atmospheric. I am playing sitting in a Rocker Chair that is on full vibration and a haptic vest strapped in and I do not like where things are headed. I may have to tap out.... definitely for the budget price, a 5 star experience in VR. Thanks Boober team for the quick port!","Dec 11, 2019 at 1:41 AM",5, 41,
2022-05-28 21:02:55.028359,LexGravity,"Really love this game, first it reminded","Really love this game, first it reminded me of 'Don't Knock Twice' which I liked, but this game is in another league, beautiful, captivating story and very scary and unusual. 
I have run into a couple of glitches though on the level with all the dolls, twice I've been walking along and then suddenly the screen goes black and all I can see are my hands.
I've checked and this isn't supposed to happen.
Apart from that great game. Thanks","Dec 12, 2019 at 11:29 AM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 21:02:55.042322,ParadiseDecay,This is how you do HORROR in VR!,"My Initial Thoughts:
This is how a VR horror game should be done, plenty of tension with unexpected jump scares and a PT/Resident Evil Vibe.

2022-05-28 21:02:55.057282,OCTONIPS,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,Played this game on xbox one and thought it was amazing so when i saw it on oculus i needed it but holy crap it blew me away at how much more immersive this game is now and how mind bending it can be!!,"Dec 15, 2019 at 9:02 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 21:02:55.071244,KhanCity,Graphical fidelity lacks,"Was excited about this one, but unfortunately, low quality port in cosmetic department, made it hard to keep playing.  Game looks dull even with supersampling cranked up.  Game mechanics seemed fine though.  Don't Knock Twice looked amazing but lacked in content.  One day we'll get full pancake titles done right, hope sooner than later.","Dec 14, 2019 at 4:06 PM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 21:02:58.169956,Toastclaimer,An atmospheric walking sim,"Layers of fear isnt so much a horror game, theres really not too much thats gonna scare you here as its mostly just a walking sim around a dream mansion. Still the game does its job well and its atmosphere is pretty darn good","Jan 4, 2020 at 10:44 PM",3, 0,
