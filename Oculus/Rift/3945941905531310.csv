Especially the highly detailed dynamic shadows make all the difference - shadow details can be set at about four detail levels depending on how fast your gaming rig is. Antialiasing is also available for PC users and goes all the way up to 8xMSAA. The PC version also has transparent water allowing you to see objects below the water.
That said, the remaining graphics look like a 25-years old PC game, you'll get no more polygons than a phone gpu like Quest can handle - and it looks very bad. Animations are close to non-existing and textures are pixelated reminding me of the Commodore 64 and Amiga. Note, such ultra-low-end graphics are not a ""design choice"", unless all Quest devs love lowest-end poly levels and no textures, lol. 
I could easily max out the Rift CV1 with ss 2.5 (27 mill pixels per frame combining both eyes) and still get solid 90 fps with best shadows and 8xMSAA. But I'm using an oc'ed RTX 3090 - extreme overkill for this Quest/PhoneVR game.
The game does Revive perfectly - with the Index, even Index controllers were correctly identified, and now I got solid 90 fps using res 500% (45 mill pixel per frame) - also with best shadows and 8xMSAA. You do not need a fast rig for this game, an old rig with a GTX 970 should be great.
This game isn't about graphics and has a fun story, and current Metascore is 80 on Metacritic, which is very high. 
I'd love to have more than one player profile when more than one person play the game. Would love smooth turning too instead of snap turning.
And seems devs could contact Nvidia to get some ray-traced shadows implemented, high-end PC users have tons of processing power to spare in this game ;-) Adding high-end PCVR RTX features to this game might give it a significant lift and get the game more attention.

Note that only the Oculus Rift version supports native Oculus drivers - the Steam version uses native Steam drivers only.",Apr 14 at 5:58 PM,3, 13,
