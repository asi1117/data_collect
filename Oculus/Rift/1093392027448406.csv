2022-05-28 15:42:28.859864,mongoose8008,Good Co-Op Game! Wish there was more,"I really enjoyed playing this game despite the low-res graphics quality. It was charming and fun, and great for cooperative play. It's challenging, and has a good variety of levels and customization, but I wish there were more food options and maybe a way to customize the diner.
Altogether, I had a lot of fun!","Apr 2, 2019 at 10:14 PM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 15:42:32.050330,geistein99,Simple concept wonderfully done,My daughter picked this game and I must say I thought it looked awful at first glance. She is a huge fan of Job simulator and this fit the bill nicely. To my surprise the game was actually really fun and very well done on the co-op aspect. We had a blast going through it although I must say this game becomes very challenging as you progress.,"Apr 9, 2018 at 8:10 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:42:32.065290,ProjectDemigod,"Extremely fun, lots of potential!","VR the Diner Duo is one of the best local multiplayer virtual reality games out there. It has a lower-budget look and feel than similar games such as Job Simulator, but don't let that deter you; flipping burgers has never felt so rewarding.

///The Pros:///
Local Multiplayer
     -Always a plus to any game, and yelling numbers back and forth while you frantically try to keep up with each other works great.

The Chef
     -Once you start memorizing orders and get comfortable with your kitchen, assembling burgers in seconds feels super rewarding

     -While it starts very slow, before long every level becomes a challenge for you to overcome

Customization
     -HATS! You can never go wrong with hats. These are awarded at the ends of certain levels, so be sure you don't skip too many with the ""Too Easy"" button

///The Cons:/// 
(Longer than Pros because constructive feedback is important)
Reliability of Controls
     -When you're going full speed as the Chef, sometimes grabbing just doesn't seem to work, or sometimes just when you're grabbing something you're not directly looking at. It sounds like it could just be user error, but everyone I've shown the game has experienced it and all say it feels like the game rather than them.

     -As the Waiter, often you have to double tap space for the game to register you trying to give someone their order or pick up something
*The Waiter (With only keyboard, not enough usb slots for gamepad)

     -Now first note, the Waiter IS FUN, it's just not as MUCH FUN. But that can be person to person.

     -Having every action done by the Waiter mapped to the spacebar messes me up a lot, forcing me to grab a drink or deliver something I didn't want to when I was just trying to move faster. Mapping the dash to LShift would help.

     -The movement is mapped to WASD, IJKL, and the arrow keys; kinda unnecessary. Having the arrow keys control the camera would be a huge help.

I would say more, but I'm hitting the character limi","May 24, 2020 at 4:54 PM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 15:42:35.139068,seekified,Amazing local co-op - but needs tweaks,"I've put a lot of hours into this with my partner. This game is great fun to play in local co-op, where one player is in VR and the other uses the flatscreen with a gamepad. Communication and efficiency is key, and learning the more difficult levels takes a fair bit of practice. Highly recommended for people who like Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes and other VR + flatscreen co-op titles. 

I do think the game could use some tweaking though, especially for the gamepad players. 

- Using the same button for both dashing and picking up/setting down plates and drinks is counterintuitive since it's easy to dash past the customer you wanted to deliver to or to accidentally deliver something to a customer that you wanted to dash past. 

- Actually picking things up and setting them down can be finicky, and I often find myself spamming the button. It feels like the alignment needs to be pixel-perfect for it to work. 

- At two-person tables, it would be nice to be able to select which customer you want to give an item to. 

I would also absolutely love a sushi mode. I think that could be a lot of fun.","Jan 16, 2018 at 12:17 AM",4, 7,

2022-05-28 15:42:35.168988,KennyMcToast,Brilliant!,There are tons of games out there that are similar to this one. However the local multiplayer option is what makes this game shine. Your friends/relatives who usually watch you play VR games can now join you and swear to every gods there is along with you when 5 costumers enter the restaurant simulteanously or when you spill your drink or when the food gets overcooked etc.  Greatest co-op VR game I played so far!,"Dec 20, 2017 at 1:16 PM",5, 4,
