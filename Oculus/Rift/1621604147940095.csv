2022-05-28 19:25:38.700455,Bob-Rolha,"Cool, just watch the scenery and relax.","I like the type of application that calmly travels or flies over the place, through a path pre-defined by the developer, without the need for me to use a control for it, because that way I can relax my arms and mind to appreciate the art, just turning the hair, that's cool. So I'll give it a positive note. But my suggestion is to put a head on the driver please, it makes it less scary. Another suggestion is to add a passenger and more places to visit. Light movements on the car and steering wheel would also give it a more realistic feel. Anyway, it's cool and it's free.",Feb 23 at 7:07 AM,4, 0,

Is there something i can do?

2022-05-28 19:25:38.746332,vegas18,An exquisite work of art.,"As a game developer myself I think I can better appreciate this work of art more than the layman. Each time I ""drive"" through this game I recognize even more the amount of effort, craftsmanship and creativity that went into this experience. It may be low-poly but it's beautifully-crafted, well-thought through and constructed. The excellent choice in music is perfectly synced with various events.  The creator(s) should be EXTREMELY proud of this work. I wish the ""drives"" could go on forever.","Mar 26, 2021 at 1:43 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 19:25:41.884937,inceptional,Cool experience for what it is,"Would be even better if you could turn off whatever soft/fog/smooth filter you seem to have over the whole game, because right now it looks to me, even on my Rift CV1, that it's running below the sharpness and clarity I know the headset can achieve. Also, boy would it be cool if you could update the graphics to be even more detailed at some point, and higher resolution too if you're not pushing them out at the highest resolution possible for the headset's capabilities, so they can really pull you into the experience.","Jul 17, 2020 at 9:15 PM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 19:25:41.914858,nightcat.mau,Amazing Stuff!,"Downloaded this on Steam when it released there earlier, and it runs about the same in either platform. The only thing is I noticed is that even directly on the Rift there is a slight hiccup when you exit the night drive tunnel and see the fireworks on max setting. High runs smooth as silk though. Still, it's beautiful and so darn relaxing to look at on max or high I don't mind.","Dec 29, 2019 at 6:52 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 19:25:41.943780,SamuraiWerewolf,The Sunday drive meets VR,"This VR experience is very relaxing and fun for what it trying to accomplish.  The music is great and the graphics enjoyable.  The devs did a wonderful job on this app.  It is like taking a Sunday drive wthout leaving the house.  The only thing I would wish for is making it a bit longer or a looping function, so you could just sit back and enjoy the ride.  It is very relaxing and worth the download to try it.","Oct 28, 2019 at 10:16 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:25:45.025538,Rift8299292,Needs more!,"What an amazing experience. Sat holding my logitech g29 wheel and pressing the accelerator pedal really added to the immersion.
Loved the lighting effects and the rain, the graphics are amazing.
This is basically Desert Bus VR but with music and interesting scenery.
Needs more tracks in the rain and dark like the second track. Didn't like the city so hope future worlds are just the open road. One problem is you don't feel in control of the car, it would be better if you were a passenger on a bus or able to control the car with the logitech G29.
This has so much potential, please update!","Aug 20, 2019 at 10:00 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 19:25:45.040498,scooterles,,"App is OK.  When I first ran it the video froze about half way through the first segment (music did not) and I could not exit without going to my desktop and using task manager.  After restarting things, the program ran through OK, but the music segments were a little short.  The driving thing is cool, perhaps a way to listen to our favorite driving tunes?  Also the number of tunnels is disconcerting.","Aug 16, 2019 at 8:43 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 19:25:45.055458,Cullinarn,The Only VR Road Trip Experience,"This is, simply, amazing. It's precisely why I got into VR.

I use road trips to clear my head, and the longer the better. The problem is, they take a lot of time. Innervisions duplicated in a couple of minutes the best parts of what a 20+ hour road-trip actually feels like. It's relaxing every time to the point my blood pressure actually drops a few points.

So yeah, there is a limited amount of material here. And occasionally something doesn't make sense (like cars driving on the wrong side of the road in Innervisions; please fix that). The graphics on things in your peripheral vision are generally medium-good quality, but the important stuff is always high quality (precisely how you feel on the road). This sort of experience is precisely what VR was made for. I would love to see what this studio could do with some money behind it. And, I'd love to see more/longer tracks. I will pay for them. This is nothing short of transformational.","Sep 22, 2019 at 9:08 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:25:45.070418,jahltd,Relaxing and great visuals,I love to take a sunset drive to relax and peel away the stress of the day. Nice imagined waves and lit visual effects that lends itself to a medium meditation experience. Very easy to sit and soak the beauty in. Now we need more and maybe eventually a sandbox for users to join together experiences to create their own version of an experience to save and share. Connect Spotify?,"Sep 11, 2019 at 8:29 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:25:45.086375,Rageinthecage77,good but needs somework,ok so i downloaded the game after reading the reviews and i gotta say your on to something but there is some things that should be changed or added.first off whoever in one of the reviews that said they hook up their wheel and push the gas must be playing a different game because you cannot steer or speed up or slow down but it would be so much better if you add that i understand its supposed to be relaxing but maybe add it for the people who would like to drive.2nd for the love of god make that steering wheel smaller dont think a tractor steering wheel is that big it breaks the immersion aint no way jesus taking that wheel lmao.3rd i seen cars pass me on a double line and stay on that side of the road until out of sight. on the sec experience and for sum reason you dont want us to see behind us because no mirrors and the back seat covers the glass other than that great experience it looked better than some AAA titles ive played with my 2080ti setting on max.great job looking forward for more this will do so well if its improved on the thinking behind it is genius,"Sep 7, 2019 at 9:58 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 19:25:48.184090,Bruce_the_Spruce,Worth a quick look,"Basic polygon style graphics. Relax and sit back style app. I sat through all 3 (takes a few mins). If you want a quick look then I recommend the second of the choices. Rain and darkness makes everything seem more real as it glosses over the low level graphics. Not a fan of the ""music"", just ambient type notes with the intention of relaxation. Maybe you will give this a good review if you are relatively new to VR? That's my only explanation for the rave reviews of 5 stars.","Sep 1, 2019 at 7:12 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:25:48.200047,MrTee_,More!,"I want more. Longer songs, more driving. This is relaxing and great. Reminds me a bit of the DemoScene. Now, if we also could have a ""bladerunner-ish"" scene, this would be 6 stars.","Aug 17, 2019 at 4:15 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:25:48.215007,Leonidas-I,"Great Concept, But Makes Me Want More!","The very concept of this game is where the genius lies; how many people genuinely enjoy going for a drive to relax, and how much more would they enjoy it if they could drive anywhere in the world without having to pay for gas?  
I personally very much enjoyed the low-poly stylization of this game.  It lacks the huge install, lag and unpolished-feeling that is all-too-common with high-graphics games while still feeling realistic due to lighting and the like.  
Pros:
I enjoyed the ""gameplay"" very much; the relaxed music, the enjoyable scenery and the feeleing of actual movement were all very calming.  
The graphics fit perfectly (see above).  
The menu is very simple and understandable.  

Cons: 
OVER TOO QUICKLY!  That's it.  

My suggestion would be to add more songs (lofi to start with), more environments (such as a more urban area), more dynamics (such as applicable stoplights, turns, bending roads, etc.) and most of all a free/infinite-mode.  In this mode the player could play any song they want and the road would randomly generate ahead of them, allowing them to feel as if they were simply driving and listening to their songs.  

Were there more substance to this, I would gladly pay money to simply relax in VR without something yoga-related.  

Keep up the good work!","Aug 17, 2019 at 12:25 PM",5, 5,
