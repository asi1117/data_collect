2022-05-28 19:35:15.146597,sandris.cibulskis,bug,well i'm so sorry for leaving only 1 star but there is really easy to do every quest by turning your table arround and the ball wont get in to those holes so you can easy to beat every single mission without losing ! :(,"Nov 16, 2020 at 11:21 PM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 19:35:15.161557,Machiventa,Fun but could be improved,"Played a few levels.  Stopped playing because the box would transfer to my other hand each time I started a new level.  Improvements could include ability to fine tune position of the box. Currently it's centered to the controller. Also adding the ball rolling sound, sounds of ball hitting rails/edges, and smoother animation would help increase immersion. Not on par with iPhone labyrinth games.","May 3, 2020 at 1:40 AM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 19:35:15.191477,lambertjamesd,Plays exactly as it looks,"You use a touch controller to navigate a ball through a maze. Ther isn't much more to it. I was able to 100% the game in a single sitting. It is a fairly slow paced game and some of the puzzle elements are a bit frustrating, such as fans that blow the ball around. There could definatly be more levels but overall if ball mazes are something you enjoy this game is worth the small cost.","Mar 10, 2019 at 7:06 AM",4, 6,Thanks for feedback. I will check fans behaviour for update. I will also add more levels and new traps ;) Edit: I see that you are first in the leaderboard :) Congratulations.
