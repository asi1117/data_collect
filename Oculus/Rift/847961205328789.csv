2022-05-28 14:59:19.866493,breakthechains2006,"Scary, atmoshperic and partially bugged","Liked the first one so decided to give this one a go.
Pretty cool stuff. Was scared a couple of times, especially in the 2017 experience, even if i tought i was prepared :))) Also liked the story and the atmosphere.  

1983 experience free of bugs but the 2017 had two gamebreaking ones. 
-First was the screen going all black when i fall in the hole in the kitchen to get the medallion.
-Second was the medallion in the same hole in the kitchen spawning near the wall, on a wooden beam and i couldn't grab it no matter what i did. Even quiting to menu and continuing got me  in the same bug. Guess only restarting the game would fix it.","Jun 16, 2021 at 12:39 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 14:59:19.881453,acanz90,"well, scared me.","These bad reviews are so dumb. "" Theres a puzzle, so im not scared"" Shut up. This was a solid game. 5/5","Mar 26, 2021 at 3:14 PM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 14:59:19.896413,Ocoolness,Decent Jumpscares,"If you want to experience a decent jumpscare make sure to use headphones and turn off the schreen, and pass the headset around, otherwise the next person wont scream as much. Comfort could be an inch better as it has some latency but despite this 5 stars from me as the jumpscares work. During the spider scene do not  crawl the persons leg like somebody did to me.","Jan 5, 2021 at 4:49 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 14:59:19.910376,flyingtuna360,not good at all,The puzzle and mechanics in the game take away from the fact its supposed to be horror and the only thing that is intended to scare you is cheap jump scares. Honestly the whole thing is a cheap rip off of Boneworks,"Jan 10, 2021 at 1:05 PM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 14:59:19.925336,Smiler713,Worth the money.,At least the top 3 of horror titles on the oculus store. Definitely has major scare value and has a lot of value when showing off vr to family and friends.,"Sep 27, 2020 at 7:39 AM",5, 17,
2022-05-28 14:59:23.063941,diemensionx,great game,"why someone said they cant get out of the grave 
, well its easy so whats your problem no hands or something, telling people not to buy it till its fix is a joke, if you cant get out the grave I would give up playing games, anyway loved the first game, the bedroom was great and scary,  this game is also scary and  has free locomotion movement and snap turn if you dont like full movement. this game can be played as a story or play individual sections game, great job as not a lot of decent horror games made for VR, to scary for people maybe, films dont frighten me now so I love a scary VR game. look foward to No 3. was just like being in a horror movie.","May 12, 2020 at 5:50 AM",5, 23,
2022-05-28 14:59:23.079898,RomanAsh,Don't waste your money,"Played it on the rift s and the game was glitchy especialy the floating island bull  in the haunted mansion. Thats an hour of my life and $20 I could have spent on beer that ill never get back. The first one was way better atleast that one had some scary parts this one was just boring. Why dont you make this piece of ""work"" free and the other one pay for?","May 19, 2020 at 12:19 PM",1, 11,

2022-05-28 14:59:23.109818,Zenbane,"Fun, but glitchy!","I'm really enjoying this. However, during ""The Investigation,"" when I put the Antenna in its spot, a glitch occurred where it did not trigger correctly. I could see the physical antenna on the device but it was also still glowing waiting for the antenna to be placed there. When I left/re-entered the house, the antenna was gone and I was stuck in the game. Had to restart. Other than this, both story modes are great!","Oct 26, 2019 at 2:51 PM",4, 14,

2022-05-28 14:59:26.229474,Seven_Shooter,Face your Fears 1,"Hey guys,  why did you not add content from other app to rift?  Samsung Gear vr, this has a lot more experiences, Bird Attack, Snakes & Spiders, plus the one where the lady buries you alive. What gives?","Jan 20, 2020 at 11:51 PM",4, 58,
2022-05-28 14:59:26.245433,lefthome,Not what I was hoping for..,"I really enjoyed the first Face Your Fears when I bought my Rift and loved showing it to newbies. You didn't need to learn any complicated controls, in fact most of the time I just put the headset on them and let them enjoy the experience. I was always disappointed that they didn't bring more episodes to the Rift like they did with the Gear and Go. I would have gladly payed for them.

When I heard that FYF2 was coming I was overjoyed, but it turns out they went in another direction entirely. It's still horror, but they've added a story and puzzles and climbing (?!). The worst part is none of those elements is as compelling or well done as the original experiences in FYF1. The climbing is awful. It is so unintuitive that they need to show you where you can grip your hands, however it's too easy to think you are gripping but then fall. Ghosts fly at you and seem to do damage (?) but the best you can do is dodge them or get slimed. 

It seems like they tried to stretch their vision with this one, but so far it is a downgrade from their previous work. I was tempted to refund at one point (the sequence after you go in the garden shed) but decided to see if I could quit and come back to it later. Luckily, even though it makes it sound like your progress will be lost entirely when you quit (confusing messaging), it seems to be continuing.. I will revisit later and go to the graveyard.

I think if I hadn't played their previous Face your Fears, and was just looking for another 'wander around with tense atmosphere' game like Dreadhalls, Exorcist or Kobold, I probably wouldn't have been as disappointed. It's not a terrible game, just a let down after enjoying their original offering so much more, while doing less. Funny that.","Jun 22, 2019 at 3:08 PM",3, 121,Really appreciate the time you took to make this review and for giving it another go.
2022-05-28 14:59:26.260392,Tailwhipolaf,Great Haunted House Game,"Love the movement in controls and climbing. Art style was Great, characters were Great, Voice acting was super, Great Halloween Game.  Difficulty is great.  Played for 3 hours,  hope you guys continue with dlc.  Every dollar worth my money.  Lots of gameplay mechanics, from running away to finding clues, working with inventory and story.  Graphics could be better, but doesnt take away from the experinece.  A horror lover MUST buy. Great Job developers.","Jul 20, 2019 at 8:56 AM",5, 7,Appreciate the great review!

2022-05-28 14:59:29.373067,paulohotline,Face Your Fears 2!,It looks and plays exactly like the Quest version. I did not notice any huge upgrades in graphics or audio in the Rift version. I would recommend this game if you are a horror fan. It's a completely different experience from the Face Your Fears 1 but still a highly entertaining one. Seeing my wife jump in terror at certain scenes is worth the price of admission alone. 4 out 5 Casper the Ghosts.,"Jun 19, 2019 at 11:50 PM",4, 22,
2022-05-28 14:59:29.389024,NotaHumanResource,Not like the Original :(,"I am a fan of Face your Fears I and the Oculus Go version. I was really hoping the Devs would port the Go version to The Rifts. Short scares that are great to show friends and family.  This reminds me of paranormal activity traveling aimlessly around a haunted house, getting killed by flying plates and knives etc.  I liked the short horror experiences but this is drawn out and frustrating.","Jul 7, 2019 at 12:45 PM",2, 9,Hi there. We hear ya! We recently updated the game so you can now jump right into the quick scary experiences.
2022-05-28 14:59:29.403984,ParadiseDecay,Scary Stuff!,"My Initial Impressions:
Sadly this feels more like a Quest port, rather than the otherway round. But it does come across as sharper and brighter on Rift S.
Unlike Face your Fears 1, Face your Fears 2 is more of a free roaming experience in the form of a main story with plenty of jump scares. At the start of the game you have the option to do the story mode, or the individual scare sequences.
The Face your Fears series is still my 'Main' goto experience to show people new to VR horror.

2022-05-28 14:59:29.417946,scranley,Really scary and fun but hard to learn!,Once you figure out the tutorial and controls the game is great. Really scary and fun. Creators need to improve onboarding experience.,"Jan 1, 2020 at 2:45 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 14:59:32.521645,Masamune5454,a fantastic horror game,"loved it. i didnt play the first one, well i did but i didnt like it. this ones a full game, so you can walk around and turn and open doors. despite what ive heard in reviews, about the climbing system being bad and the controls being complicated.... which honestly the controls are simple. theres move, and grab. also a flashlight button. thats it. thats no where near the complexity of H3VR.
also this is a full game, so it even has a little fast travel map. i loved it and hope for at least one more story level like the first one, but in a new place. maybe 2 levels and they can do the timezone thing like they did here. ya took me a few hours to complete even going quickly. also climbing was excellent. this climbing system is one of the best i have seen. so agian its great, and i dont really agree with the other reviews. if i did have something bad to say it would be that i got scareded. wait your supposed to be scared poopless. oh then in that case right on. good game","Jun 28, 2019 at 3:54 PM",5, 7,Thank you so much for the review and feedback!
2022-05-28 14:59:32.536605,Kenworth14102,scary but fun as hell...,"i thought i knew what to expect from this game as i have played the first and used it as a demonstration of vr to my friends however i was pleasantly surprised to find Face Your Fears 2 is a much bigger game in every way. As to be expected there are plenty of jump-scares but this time there are also puzzles to solve, doors to unlock and creepy creatures to kill. the game puts you in scary but creative scenarios and its a blast to play through. Rift S graphics can be set to take advantage of your high-end pc and it still stands as the perfect introduction to VR for newcomers.","Jun 23, 2019 at 11:06 PM",5, 7,
