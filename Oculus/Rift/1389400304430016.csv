2022-05-28 14:15:37.248619,deadgarret,A missed oportunity...,"...of being one of the best games/sports activities on the Quest platform.
This game is one of my favorites, I gladly play it for 15-20 min. any time. However there are sooo many ways the developer could enhance the experience to make this game perfect.

- the single player mode is boring. You simply beat the opponents, maybe replay some matches to get all 3 stars from every robot, but that's it. It would be so easy to spice up things with an achievement system: Beat an opponent without mistakes, beat an opponent with only power shots, etc. Just take a look at In Death: Unchained.

- The unlockable gear dull. A variety of rackets would be a nice addition, and more options in general would make the game more colorful. Just take a look at Blaston.

- No sfx for the single player opponents at all. Ok, this would surely annoy someone, but this could be an option in the menu. In my opinion this would enhance the immersion so much.

- The motion capture of the robots are very amateur in some cases. For example you can see that the floating robot ""walks"" without having legs.

- More enviroments would be a nice addition.

- The gained xp is not scaling with better performance. You make 9 mistakes or zero, you get the same.

- Leader boards, monthly events would be nice too.

Anyways, I still love this game, will play it, but it would be soo good to see it improve over time like other games do.","Jun 8, 2021 at 6:46 PM",3, 9,
2022-05-28 14:15:37.263580,rchrdcrg,The fun one!,"When it comes to VR table tennis, I reviewed Eleven as ""the best one"" but this one is definitely ""the fun one"". The physics here aren't quite realistic, but they're so close that it still feels right, yet it's tweaked just enough that you won't get quite as frustrated as with a more realistic simulator. These two main VR table tennis games really represent two sides of the same coin, and they're very hard to choose between. If you have the money and love table tennis, just get both. If you want a more arcade experience while still feeling realistic, this is your game. If you want something so real that it might actually help your real-life table tennis skills, try the other one.","Dec 30, 2020 at 4:08 AM",5, 10,

For all my friends the rankings are displayed on the screen and go up and down after playing a match. However this is not the case for me, my ranking does not go up or down or even display on my screen. I grinded this game for a decent bit and got all the way to semi pro III but i wanted to see my ranking so I thought uninstalling and re installing may fix the issue, however all it did was ERASE my charachter and reset me to a rookie i lost everything and STILL cant see my ranking after all of this.","Jan 6, 2021 at 9:22 AM",1, 5,

Prior  I watched the gameplay and I was certain that this game is a must for table tennis fans. Great experience in single player mode, practice or competition.   A big disappointment though in multiplayer. Table tennis is a game for two players and the multiplayer experience is very important. That is why I no longer play this table tennis game but another one. If the multiplayer mode would be improved this game would be a winner.","Aug 27, 2020 at 5:22 AM",3, 5,

2022-05-28 14:15:40.419278,VictorFdez7,Disappointed,"I like this game, the physics are pretty cool and the scifi setting makes it more interesting. Bought it mainly because of the single player mode and I wasn't able to have fun at all. Playing vs the IA its so unfair it becomes frustrating, the first levels are way too easy and when you rank up you face IA's that feel all the same to me and that make you realise that you are playing vs a machine. It feels like the IA decides wich points you win or lose before the point starts. It doesn't matter if your shot was good at all, if the IA decides that you lose this one, you will no matter how good your shots are. I understand making IA's its a pretty hard thing to do, but this one doesn't react to the player performance, it makes a winner you can't react to or misses, thats all.","May 30, 2020 at 11:26 PM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 14:15:40.434237,Plutonium-239,Good single player/Awful multiplayer,"If you are reading this you are probably asking yourself which VR table tennis is the best available right now. The answer might disappoint you but it depends on what you are looking for.
 
This game looks polished at first, with nice graphics/good physics and everything. 

Then you start noticing that something isn't quite right:

Simulation seems real a first, but then you notice that it is NOT as accurate as that of Eleven (the other VR table tennis game used as obvious comparison). Personally I am looking for maximum realism for  table tennis games so this for me is a very important point.

For this game multiplayer takes ages to find an opponent and when it does it lags so much that it is unplayable. My experience has been poor so far. On the contrary eleven is much much better and has a very nice community.

Single player is quite nice and it is better than Eleven in my view, as there is a sort of championship against AI which is challenging enough. Also i like the sense of progression when you unlock new skins for your robot. In Eleven there is just a minimum customisation. Also the number of lighting/environments is better in this game than in Eleven.

I have a beefy PC but i am also experiencing serious performance problems like massive framerate drops...but i get that with Eleven sometimes, so it is a tie here.

Now, if you just want to play/practice against AI, then this game is absolutely fine, but if you want a better multiplayer experience or a more realistic physics then go for Eleven. 

Note that if you decide to own both (like i did) you will notice that when you will get more skilled at one of the two, somehow the skill is not transferrable, and I think this is due to the difference in simulation quality. In other words, if you get good in Eleven, you'll suck in this one and viceversa.

Last point: Cost. Eleven is chaper.

It needs another level or two of bots, perhaps greater variation of styles, just four AI players with upgraded capabilities and skins.

2022-05-28 14:15:40.480115,Red_Go,Easy to play but hard to master,"I've tried several table tennis games.  Since I'm not good at table tennis in real, some were too realistic and hard to play.  But some were too arcade so didn't feel like playing actual sports.  I think this game is just in between.  Arcade mode is really good for new comers like me.  After some experience, I started to play simulation mode and it's still hard but enough to manage.  Fantastic graphics, great sound, reasonable physics.

The physics (simulation) seems to be better compared to an older version I played. The new scenario in the sports hall is also very nice and fits best to the topic table tennis. So I give you 5 stars for the great work.,"Aug 10, 2019 at 4:29 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 14:15:43.623856,brenttwalker,I never give five stars,"Five stars is something that needs no improvement.  I work for a major software company and have also worked for small start ups.  I know the difficulty of creating truly great software.  

I am not a pro table tennis player.  I have purchased numerous custom paddles and played against very, very good players.  I wouldn't say great because they don't do it for a living. 

Anyway, I love this game and play it daily for about twenty minutes.  I have only gotten through about two thirds of the robot ladder because I am a little stuck.  I have this robot's number sometimes and just fail to follow through.  Other times I just don't have it.  This is the type of stuff I live for.  It's a lot of fun and sometimes aggrevation for twenty minutes between doing something I need/have to do.

This is my first review and the reason for writing this is because there was an update to this game that made it unusable for me.  I looked up the email address of the company and let them know the specifics.  WIthin a half hour a got an email response and within three hours Oculus had an update that fixed the problem.

It turns out this ""company"" is one dude.  My hats off to him.  Anyone who thinks they can do better with just one person, I want to see that game (table tennis or whatever)

**  I forgot to mention **
As an update, I forgot to mention that during the three hour ""outage"" I experienced with this game, I took that opportunity to purchase ""eleven table tennis"" because I had an itch to play.  That was a really bad mistake for me.  I have a beefy computer and video card, but the game played very choppy.  The deal breaker was that the table was knee level and I couldn't find a way to reposition it.  I exited the app and started again, same thing.  I requested a refund after a total of three minutes.  Others don't seem to have this problem, so I can only speak for myself","Aug 1, 2019 at 1:51 PM",4, 6,

Each player will see something different on their side. I’ll hit it to the left, see them miss, and it’ll teleport to their paddle and hit back when I wasnt expecting it, thinking I won the round.

2022-05-28 14:15:46.784037,taquitobuddy,Multiplayer is broken atm,"UPDATE: Still getting the multiplayer bug with opponent paddle angle not displaying correctly with the latest update, thanks for adding table color.  Will check back in a week or two.  

To get the big one out of the way and the reason for the (hopefully) temporarily low rating, multiplayer has a game-breaking bug atm where your opponent's paddle position is not correctly displayed.  Since I purchased this for the multiplayer, until this is fixed there really isn't any game here for me at all.  As a side note, the multiplayer is also dead in terms of # of players, no one is playing.  So if/when they fix the MP, be sure you have a friend to play with if you are expecting matches.

Regarding the rest of the game, polish/presentation is fine, nice touch with all the different AI's to play against in the championship mode.  Also has a training mode but it doesn't explain what the stats do, so I have no idea how to use it.  Physics is fine.  There is no option to use a real table tennis colored table however, hopefully they add this.  Devs seem active so I think this will continue to improve.

The bottom line is that if you are 100% only interested in single player table tennis VS AI, then both Eleven and Racket Fury are similar enough that I'd say just get whichever one is on sale/cheaper.  If you have any interest in multiplayer, then Eleven is the game to get.","May 9, 2019 at 7:37 AM",2, 6,

Once I did, it made it that much better. I play table tennis almost daily through the week. This game feels really, really close. I tried Eleven out on a free weekend. It was great, but I don't feel like it felt as good as this one.

If you're on the fence about this game, I would give it a chance. I'd love to have some players online and in-game. That is the only criticism - this game shines in multiplayer, but there aren't very many players, in any region. I wish there was a bigger player base. Perhaps, Steam queues are bigger.

Racket Fury remains the best performing, finest looking, and most accurate table tennis game around.  It performs well, and feels like I'm accurately playing the game.  Mind you, I'm no pro; perhaps there may be professionals out there who will need the vapors after reading my blasphemy, but from a sometime table tennis amateur, I gotta say it: this feels right.  And if accuracy isn't your thing, there's an arcade mode to keep it simple.  The robots you play against are the right balance of challenging to keep it fun, and keep me coming back for more.  Only one minor issue at the moment: nobody else was playing.  At least tonight (a Tuesday evening).  They have a nice option to search for players in the background while you practice against robots; no standing around doing nothing while you wait.  Hopefully the waiting won't be long for long.  Seriously, check this one out.  I've tried Eleven, and while they've made great strides with their physics, it still doesn't hold a candle to the accuracy here, nor does it perform anywhere near as well.

I bought this game in the Oculus Store even though I already have the game in Steam just so i can give feedback to the dev/customer service.  As with the title, the game is actually good, however, the dev/customer service sucks big time.  I contacted them and asked that since i already bought this game on Steam, can i instead transfer the key to the Oculus Store.  No response at all.  Now I know it's not their fault that I bought this game on a different platform instead of waiting it to be available in the Oculus Store.  Having said that, I do know of other games that I bought on other platforms and then became available later in the Occ Store and when I contacted the devs and explained my case, they did give me a key to transfer it to Oculus Home.  Hopefully when i refund this game this review will not disappear.

P.S.  I hate running Steam in the background just to play a VR game.  I stopped purchasing Steam VR games a long time ago after some bad experiences.

***EDIT 2019Mar05***  It was great for the developer to reach out to me and provide me with the key.  I actually haven't used the key yet as I already bought my own way before this free key was given.  Regardless, I appreciate the gesture.

I paid just 7.5 bucks for this game - it simply feels like getting table tennis at home - but I can play against cool and different robots! The game quickly gets challenging, there's great fun for both beginners and advanced players. Physics effects are awesome - it feels like real gravity on the ball.

Its a very basic game from what ive played (which isnt much) but it absolutely nails the physics. The sound and feel is just spot on. Controls vibrate so well that it feels like you are actually holding a paddle and hitting a ball, its crazy. Love that the ball shows the spin you put on it as you hit it. Serving is really difficult for me so far but itll get better as I play. Def check this out if you want a casual pong game, wont be dissappointed","May 4, 2018 at 8:37 AM",5, 3,

The AI is well done, but this game would be twice as great with an online option.
There are lots of settings to tweak the sim, only wished there would be a way to dim the glowing white or orange ball a bit.

There are annoying glitches, that need to be addressed:
-- The game like to crash a lot.

--I only got a 2 sensor config, it seems sometimes the backhand side isn't captured properly and it happens that balls went through the paddle.

--When AI opponents serve, sometimes they drop the ball under the table and the match comes to an end, nothing happens there is no other option then aborting the match, very annoying at the 3rd set or in tournament.","Apr 30, 2018 at 11:06 PM",3, 1,

Just whack away at the ball against difficult (and taunting) AI robot opponents. The action is fast paced and intense. It gave me a workout! I give it 4 stars mainly because some opponents are very difficult--- a little too difficult. They move so fast, they basically teleport to the ball at times. The only way to win is to have them make a mistake which I guess is programmed into their behavior. If you practice with them, they make no mistakes. Still loads of fun though.

As an arcady type game though, its not bad and may appeal more to others. Something about the way the forehand feels for me is just not right with how I hold the paddle. I tried adjusting the different selections, but I just couldn't get the right feel. With Eleven, I didn't have to tweak anything. As soon as I picked up the paddle it felt natural.

Short version:
If you want a true to life simulation to this game, buy Racket Fury. If you want a casual/more arcadey game, either Racket Fury or Eleven are great buys. 

Long version: 
For those looking for a realistic table tennis game...look no further! Seriously...just before buying this, I bought Eleven (another table tennis game). At first the Eleven game was mindblowing. I couldn't believe how realistic the game was but I found a serious flaw with Eleven. The forehand's spin mechanic is completely broken b/c it is as if the forehand rubber was anti-spin rubber. Also, the AI in Eleven was not good at all. After some research, I found that this game: Racket Fury is SO CLOSE TO REAL LIFE! At first I blew this game off after watching the trailer but I realized that the trailer shows the Arcadey Mode and not the hyper-realistic full simulation mode. I bought it, I don't regret it, buy it. Everything about this game was done right. This will be a great training tool for serious players. I don't train as often with my bestfriend due to travel distance, so this is a great game to use when I want to train whenever I want.

I haven't played meatspace table tennis in 20 years, so I had to give it a shot in VR since the reviews for Racket Fury and Eleven have been so good lately.

Guys, it's legit, it really is.  It's so fun.  After several minutes, all my muscle memory came back to me from playing when I was younger.  I made the same good shots I used to make.  But also the same bad ones too, especially when switching from backhand to forehand and dumping the ball into the net.  I did this so often when playing on a real table and it was no different with Racket Fury.

I had forgotten how much rhythm, concentration, and focus there is to table tennis and I lost myself in immersion during long rallies.   Playing this in VR is utterly engrossing.  The sights, sounds, and feel in the game are really good.  Table tennis really lends itself well to VR.

But make sure you have some room in your play space, this game requires about the same amount of space you would need for a meatspace table.

2022-05-28 14:16:18.397038,kusomonome,Almost real.,"According to Steam it's got multiplayer, but here at Oculus it shows only Single.  imo, mp is a must.

Good①　For the most part the physics are solid. I move my arms just like I do when I actually play and for the most part the result is expected, but that's for the forehand.  Bad①　I use my backhand more than most players, and when using it there the collision doesn't seem right (like it bounces off the paddle way later than it should and just feels really laggy even with grip style set to backhand). I have to slow down my wrist/arm movements on backhands, effectively use it like my forehand, and it's OK.  

Bad②　Sometimes when putting completely vertical forehand topspin on it I get no detection - this happens to me almost 100%.  Ball just passes through.  If I tilt my forehand so the paddle is about at a 15 degree angle or more to the table it works perfect.

Bad③
The instant the ball leaves your paddle, if it's not going to land on the table, bots freeze up.  I don't like this.  A good part of the fun of table tennis is waiting to see if it's gonna land.  The bots know it isn't immediately, and that sucks.  

Kinda Bad④ You don't lose a point for missing your serve.  You should.  That would make it feel more like a simulation.  I know that it's possible to detect this. (The option to enable it might be there, but it should be on by default for simulation.)

All that aside, I'm amazed at how real this game feels.  It surprised me. I give it 3.5 stars.  

It's definitely worth the price they sell it for. If they fixed up the physics and collision detection just a little bit more, AND added MP I'd pay at least $30 for this no questions asked.","Nov 29, 2017 at 7:44 PM",4, 3,

You have a lot of control over your shots, but it's still forgiving enough to account for limitations of VR/resolution and skill level. The spin indicator on the ball is helpful because without it, you'd have no way of knowing what kind of spin is on the ball.

I play table tennis a ton and I can tell you that playing this game is just like the real thing.  It took me a little bit to get the adjustments of the paddle angle and such perfect, but once I did, it made the world of difference.  Every shot I do in real life is the same here, even the bad shots. 

Only 4 stars because there's 1 major component missing and a couple tweaks to be made.  The major component missing is the ability to customize your paddle.  Most table tennis players will tell you that custom building your paddle makes all the difference in the world.  Given the sophistication of the physics in this game, I can't see why it would be difficult.  Then the game progression would improve as well.  Rather than buying parts for your character that you can't even see, you'll be able to upgrade and customize your paddle.  Hoping the developers can get that done.

Also, tweaking the settings is difficult with the sliders.  They're too senstive, so if I want to land on 76 degrees exactly for my paddle angle, it takes forever.  There should be an arrow that lets me make small adjustments without using motion to adjust the slider.

Even with spin at 100, the ball doesn't curve in the air enough on low speed shots, nor does spin affect the table bounce as much as it should.

I'm a pretty good table tennis player in real life and can say that the simulation game feels about as good as one can expect. I've not tried the arcade game, but I've no interest in it.

I'm still struggling to settle on a natural bat angle setting, this is no fault of the game (the option is there) but I doubt I'll ever get it 100% right because as good as the Touch controller is, it doesn't feel quite right in my hand compared to a real bat. The ball physics are very good, albeit not perfect - the ball does seem to slide ever so slightly and is also that bit too bouncy when rolling it around/bouncing it on the bat, but I'm not sure if this strange act is transferred onto actual gameplay in any way. To be honest, if the haptics were stronger (I have it set to max), the sensation of hitting the ball would be almost lifelike. 

The AI is more than able to put up a decent challenge; I've managed to 3 star all the 'Rusty' and 'Plastic' games, but 'Gold' is now a proper challenge, only 2 starring the first two bots and not able to beat Tera Knox...yet! Hopefully the devs will achieve good online gameplay, that is where the real fun should be. At this point, though, and again for the low price, it's an easy 5/5 recommendation to all who enjoy a bit of table tennis, novice or expert.","Nov 26, 2017 at 10:58 PM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 14:16:34.238817,djas47,Really really good,"I play a lot of table tennis and I realy enjoy playing this game.  It acts as a good practice session and it feels like I am really playing.

I have got up to Semi pro 3 (level 13) and at this level its really a good challenge.  And this level is only 1/3 through the third championship out of 4. So there is plenty left for me to do.

There are a few niggles - it likes strokes to be quite obvious and my default serve is a bit more brushy which it doesnt like, but that is OK.

Really really pleased that this game exists and Im really enjoying playing it","Nov 15, 2017 at 8:07 AM",5, 4,

Simulator is very realistic and actually feels like your playing real ping pong.  Arcade mode subtley helps you so you don't have to be as precise, which frees you up to hit the ball hard and add spin easily.  There are some bugs and multiplayer is not yet available, but I hope the developers will get these ironed out.  Great game overall.","Nov 19, 2017 at 8:16 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 14:16:43.746778,CosmicProphet,"Really good, could be spectacular.","This is a review of the simulation mode:

I'm an avid table tennis player, and to be fair, really didn't expect much from this title, I was surprised, it was WAY better than expected. It needs work to be a viable practice bot, but I really think with some work they could actually get it there.

Overal play was smooth and I didn't feel any overt response problems.

Here is what I hope they can tune up:

The paddle feel is pretty far off. Mostly I think it's because you can't dial in dwell time or trampolene effect so you can't get it to feel like a real paddle.

When the ball is moving fast, it strobes, not much worse than playing under fluorescent lights however. It does make it difficult to follow the ball into the paddle.

When the paddle is moving fast is strobes massivly and is distracting if you glance at it.

The biggest problem is that you can't attack agressivly since the paddle swings through the ball missing it.

So, why 4 stars?  This is an amazing attempt. Way better than I expected it could be. It's super playable and fun.

I'll be keeping it and looking forward to updates! Kudos to the developers for this!","Nov 10, 2017 at 10:39 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 14:16:43.796645,FastLawyer,The hype is real,"You can believe the 5 star reviews, this game is legit.  I don't even play ping pong in real life, yet I'm having tons of fun playing this game.  It feels good, from the physics, to the visuals, to the reflex timing.  It all comes together for a pleasant, yet challenging experience.  I didn't think I could properly serve after my first match.  Started my second match, and I was serving perfectly each time (not the best serve, but I was not faulting or losing points on serve).  I lost my first match against the AI in arcade mode and only scored 4 total points.  I beat the AI in my second match in only 2 sets.  Definitely felt like when I lost a point it was due to my error and that I had control over my own performance.  That's quite the exhilirating experience and one that many sports VR titles do not get right.  You have total control over the outcome.  And most of it is mental, because you do get lots of assists in arcade mode to make it an easier game for a noob at table tennis like me.  Even more amazing is that I was doing it with only front facing sensors and basically only standing room.  Rating 9/10 (assuming multiplayer gets here quickly)","Nov 12, 2017 at 5:58 AM",5, 0,
