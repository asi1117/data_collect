2022-05-28 17:38:29.963001,AliceHalley,A Slightly flawed yet amazing piece.,"Stunning visuals and sound, a truly amazing free experience. My only complaint is that it didn't feel very immersive, and made me feel very dizzy at times because you are just being thrown through space at some parts. The Boat sequences were great, and that is what it should have consisted of entirely.
But I don't want this to undermine how great it is. I'd recommend it for everyone that isn't easily motion sick.","Jan 17, 2020 at 6:54 PM",4, 1,

This 27 minute long video is nothing short of a stunning, aural and visual masterpiece in motion.  I have enjoyed this ride a multitude of times and when friends come over, this is my go-to, first time VR experience I share with people.","Dec 3, 2018 at 1:00 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 17:38:36.235224,DJHeroMasta,I'm Not A Fan Of Opera's But This...,"This wasn't bad at all. In fact, I just finished watching it back to back three times in a row as I was trying to figure out what the hell I was watching...In a good way :D. I will say this though, this experience could use a bit more optimization. The recommended video card is a GTX 970. I'm using a GTX 1060 6GB and I'd dip below 90fps here and there for short periods of time on the High Preset. Do note that the high preset sets a pixel density of 1.0 and the medium preset sets it to 0.80 with graphical effects being dramatically lowered. If you/your rig can handle it, I HIGHLY recommend that you super sample this experience to at least 1.5. Yes, with my GTX 1060 I was dropping frames more often but as I mentioned previously, it only needs a bit of optimization and It wasn't breaking my immersion as I never dipped below 60fps (45fps is the minimum for VR but 90fps is where you want to be). Not only was my experience still enjoyable at 1.5, it was enhanced! I was able to make out the details in the actor's faces and textures became much clearer allowing me to focus more on the details off in the distance as well as up close.","Jul 31, 2018 at 3:37 PM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 17:38:48.817571,TemplarGFX,Virtual Reality Art!,"I was suprised by this, it was alot more impressive than I was expecting.

I recommend you have something to hold onto if your new to VR as your not in control of your movement and it can put you off balance. (or sit down, but I feel VR is more immersive if your standing and holding onto say your chair is just as grounding)

This is a short experience best discovered rather than relayed so I will just say that it is beautifully put together, dark and surreal with some amazing special effects and breathaking scenes.

One of those experiences you can use to really wow people with VR and show them its more than just shooting people and throwing stuff!","Sep 30, 2017 at 8:06 PM",5, 1,

But this free music video experience is the best one (better than Friend of Mine IMHO).  First of all, the music is absolutely amazing.  Very talented composers and singers.  Also, the VR environment captured the mood of the song.  I even started to feel heat when the boat got into the depths of hell, my mind was obviously playing tricks on me.  And it felt joyful to rise above it all as the music hit its final stanza.  Bravisimo!  Please make more.","Aug 22, 2017 at 11:36 AM",5, 0,

Reminds me of the artsy CGI videos of early 90s that were made just because they could, without any real direction or point.  Its free and short so no harm done, but there are more interesting free experiences out by now.  Probably runs well on low end hardware at least!
