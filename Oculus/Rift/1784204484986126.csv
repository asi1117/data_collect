2022-05-28 16:44:14.400946,vikadov2001,"Detailed, though delicate.","The game overall brings you a fun bartending experience, requiring the player to memorise the contents, measurements, tools and steps for each drink. Its performance is almost spot on, other than a few bugs here and there. When attempting to flip some items, lag may follow and disrupt certain actions. There have been a few times where bottles have broken when placing them down as per usual, where the game made false 'fails' on drinks despite following the instructions,  followed by 'challenge mode' remaining locked on some levels at times, even when already passed. Though these issues do disrupt the gameplay, I view them as minor compared to how much this game delivers to its players. The variety of drinks, modes and locations makes this simulator a good workout for the brain, and worth the cost!","Feb 10, 2020 at 7:16 PM",4, 17,

2022-05-28 16:44:14.429868,neuoc,Very realistic,"ok this game is a true simulator, this game does everything right with making the drinks, they seem to have a annoying system for rating though. Besides that the game is faboulouse and actually fun.","Dec 9, 2019 at 6:07 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 16:44:17.552517,kaitouace,,"Looks nice, plays poorly. Game should judge a drink once you place it down , not while you are still making it, it should be possible to start anew. Furthermore, it randomly fails drinks as you make them and explains nothing. It should also be possible to see what goes into the drink you're making, instead of having to hit ""HINT"" and have the drink vanish out of your hand because you put in the mint or limes in the wrong order.","Jun 24, 2018 at 4:07 AM",1, 27,
2022-05-28 16:44:17.567476,leeorus78,,"I like the precision and graphics.The presentation overhaul is really proffessional and you can see the attention to small details.
The only reason this doesnt get a five is because if you have  only 2 front facing sensors , taking drinks from the fridge behind you is difficult , as the sensors can't register my hands movement when i face away from them.","Jun 23, 2018 at 2:39 PM",4, 15,
2022-05-28 16:44:17.584432,Sith’ari,Realistic,The ice looks amazing and I had no troubles with peformance. The recipes for drinks are real so you could use this to train to be a real bartender who flips drinks.,"Jun 18, 2018 at 12:00 PM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 16:44:17.601385,TheCupcakeGod,It's Fun But It Crashes A Lot,"Good sounds and environment, you will need a large space to play as well. There are frequent crashes as of this patch, so don't expect to play very long. The juggling feels very smooth as does the pouring. Overall, very good game (minus the crashes of course)","Jun 16, 2018 at 11:42 AM",4, 16,
