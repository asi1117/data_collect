2022-05-28 19:49:09.496297,theregoes2,Okay.,"It's a full movement FPS which is something that I've wanted to see a lot more of, but you move by using the trigger as a gas pedal and the rotate the controller to strafe. I think that you're supposed to be able to smooth turn based on my reading of the instructions but if so it doesn't work. Instead I have to turn in incremements with the left analogue stick which is always disorienting for me or turn with my body which gets me tangled up pretty quickly when trying to fight a bunch of enemies. I would much rather that locomotion just used the analogue sticks the way we have all become accustomed to. Aside from that I found the graphical style made it difficult to see where I was going and where the enemies were. Also, my bullets felt really underpowered. I would rather fifty enemies that die in one or two shots than five enemies that take ten or more shots.","Jun 5, 2017 at 2:24 AM",2, 0,"Hi theregoes2, thanks for the feedback! New control options are now available including full joystick control, snap rotation and smooth rotation. 
New bots, graphical updates, a new weapon and 2 more levels have now been added.
Gun power & enemy damage tweaks have also been updated which should address those issues.
Hope you like the new updates and I welcome any further feedback you may have."
2022-05-28 19:49:09.512254,Trisity,Awesome Tron like game!,"Loving the updates to this game, the new level & weapon is awesome! Can't wait for more. 
Finally! A fully locomotive fast paced shooter for peeps with good VR legs. This game has a great cyberspace visual style & blood pumping tunes! It even has a platformy type section (don't get squished). Highly recommended!","Sep 16, 2017 at 6:22 AM",5, 2,Thank you! There is a lot more to come!
