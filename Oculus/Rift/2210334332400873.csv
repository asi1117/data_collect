2022-05-28 20:58:15.934835,poonreaper,More people need to play this,My friend and I have been having unlimited amounts of fun now that we've learned how to make put-put courses pretty well. The POV function around the golf ball can be funky sometimes but you adjust to it very quickly. With a bigger player base and more levels being created this game could end up being so great!,"May 9, 2021 at 5:43 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:58:15.954781,oliver.jp,Overall good but some basic annoyances,"Mostly this game is good. Nice sound, nice design etc and ignoring the annoyances I have, it’s very playable and fun. I’m really surprised it has these issues because it would be really easy to sort them out. The issues are based around teleporting, turning and where you start a hole.

Basically, everything is centered around the ball. You start off literally on the ball, looking towards the hole. It would be much better to start half a metre away from the ball, perpendicular to the direction of the hole. This also goes for teleporting to the ball, once again, it places you on the ball, not beside it. Secondly, when you snap turn, it turns you relative to the ball, not yourself. So say you teleport yourself to the right position and then need to turn, you will end up in a different spot.

These issues I could just about forgive if there was just a play space marker but there isn’t. Having to deal with these issues EVERY SHOT is very tiresome. Not to mention getting tangled up in the cord or roaming around your play space because you end up trying to avoid teleporting or snap turning. 

It seems really strange to me that the rest of the game is well done but this fundamental interaction is just wrong. It would be really easy to sort out.

Please, please, please devs. Sort this out. I’ll gladly update this to a five star review but getting annoyed by such basic game design is not something I want.","May 24, 2020 at 2:00 AM",2, 8,

My Initial Thoughts:
A simple but satisfying golf game with great handling and spot-on golfing mechanics.
BUT they REALLY need to MOVE the placement of the BALL!","Jan 30, 2020 at 12:50 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 20:58:15.983704,jknick,Excellent Game & Telepresence Experience,"This is what social VR is meant to be.  I played Cloudlands 1 quite a bit with friends and was excited for #2 because it meant I could now get in with friends with the Quest.  My Rift CV1 has been playing great (with some minor audio problems) with the Quest version.  While I wish the graphical quality were better, the flat shaded polygon style works well and is secondary to everything else they're getting right.  It's a great social and competitive experience.  Oculus avatars are used, you can see the full tracked movements of everyone else in the game down to club swings and head nodding, teleporting around the new outdoor courses is intuitive, audio quality is great, and the game itself just lends well to hanging out with friends.  Telepresence.  The pace of golf is already really good for this and they've managed to get the physics and playablitlity of the game down.  I would call this a must have game that demonstrates how social VR gaming should be done.","Jan 27, 2020 at 10:42 AM",5, 3,
