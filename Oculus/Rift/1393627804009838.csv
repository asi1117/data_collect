2022-05-28 18:53:50.976932,Rambollo,Amazing,"At first I thought it's OK. But omg, this is one of the greatest apps ever made for VR. A true magical experience that is hard to describe. Don't make the mistake to scratch just the surface of the app. Check the different shaders, play with physical properties and scale and have a great time!",Sep 25 at 9:12 AM,5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:53:50.991892,rchrdcrg,Trippy. Boring. Awesome.,"This is one of those things where I ask myself why I bought this, but on the rare occasion I load it up I'm reminded of just how mesmerizing it can be. Sometimes it's just fun to play around without any goals or enemies or any point to it at all, kinda like being a kid kicking a ball around in a parking lot all by yourself. This is also a great app to load up for people new to VR.","Dec 30, 2020 at 4:02 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:53:51.005855,Ender772,Love iT! Music is a must!,"Ohh Man..at first I thought I made a mistake.  But after some good old fashing exploring this program is amazing.   The different types of physic and gravity settigns are quite varied.  It can be like liquid, plantets, some clay like substance..the scale settings...everything ties together.  I can see myself playing this for hours...Much like I did of Chunky Orbits","Mar 29, 2020 at 2:24 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:53:51.020815,SpektreOculus,One of my first programs,"This was one of my first VR programs, and I must say it was a blast. Even though initially I just got it to experiment with VR, I still pop in sometimes to zone out to the colors.","Feb 12, 2020 at 2:48 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:53:51.035775,ericthedesigner,Title Screen is amazing!,I own the version on Oculus and Steam version and neither has ever worked. The title screen is amazing! But as soon as I press a button to get the show started all the spheres move to the floor and go behind me and just flicker in the corner of the play area. I have unistalled and reinstalled 5 times and now I give up. I am running the latest x570 and ryzen processor but no go. I even installed it on my other machines with the same outcome.,"Dec 4, 2019 at 5:21 AM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 18:53:54.155431,northbayray,Big reason I bought Oculus Rift,"I love this, I played this and Google Earth VR at a friend's house and was amazed by this psycheleic space fun. I couldn't get it out of my mind so I finally sprang for a Rift and picked this up. I keep discovering fun things to do with the tools and particles, and often find myself just laying on the floor moving stuff around. Took me two weeks to notice what happens when you look closely at the dots at the end of the manipulator wands...a very nice touch! Great intro to VR for when friends come by.","Oct 19, 2018 at 11:31 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:53:54.171389,RocketWorld26,Oooo...  Ahhh...  Nice,"For my first try at this I played a Chicago concert from 1970 on YouTube.   A very relaxing and fun experience.  A nice way to clear you mind.  Highly recommended!!!

Simple enough to enjoy on your first try yet there are so many settings and options that the posibilities for interesting effects seems endless.

One of my favorite things to do is to set my left hand to attract the particles and set my right hand for explotion, then gather a bunch of particles around my left hand then stick my right hand in the middle and boom!

I am excited to pick out my music for my next trip; perhaps some Pink Floyd?

Thanks devs, this is very cool!","Nov 21, 2018 at 12:52 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:53:54.186348,Thermr,Awesome! So much fun.,If you have imagination and creativity then this app will definitely hold your attention for a good while. Absolutely stunning experience. Very insightful experience for anyone learning about gravity and forces.,"Nov 18, 2018 at 5:41 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:53:54.201308,Catsruler1,Awesome program!!!,"I was playing music when I first booted it up and it synced automatically without any setup. It is fun to play around with and controlls are pretty easy to get used to. It does take a bit to get all the functions figured out, but overall it is a great addition to my game collection.","Oct 26, 2018 at 10:56 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:53:54.215271,L.E.D.BLUE,Controls need work.,Cool expirence but with really clumsy controls.,"Nov 22, 2018 at 11:45 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:53:57.310991,UglyFish819,Lots of fun,Not really a game so much as an 'experience' .. and definatlly one everyone should try given the super low cost.,"Nov 3, 2018 at 8:50 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 18:53:57.325952,Marcan37,A big performance drop . Many glitches,"I got a I7-6700k and a 1080gtx with 16gb and totally unable to go more than 50% of balls . When I bought this , I was able to make apear almost all the balls and it was running perfetc.  And what a horrible bug making me think this app is dangerous . It make flickers very bad in some times.  I would ask a refund but it looks like I'm stucked with this horrible App. Was very good at the start but frankly .... a big drop in performances since a couple of weeks.","Aug 3, 2018 at 8:55 PM",1, 0,"Chroma Lab has not been updated since you first played it meaning it is either an issue on your end or a change with the Oculus run time.  I strongly suspect it is the former as the overall performance statistics for Chroma Lab have not changed since launch (still ~3% of frames are dropped on average).  

If you haven't already I would try closing other programs, especially your web browser and restarting your computer if closing programs doesn't work.  
Please let me know if this does or doesn't fix the performance issues."
2022-05-28 18:53:57.340911,demotricus,Cool experience,"Impressive. A good app for showing off VR to your friends and gives a glimpse of what VR is capable of. My only criticism is its much of a one trick pony, once you`ve seen it and played it for a while it kinda loses its `wow factor`.","Jun 9, 2018 at 6:12 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 18:53:57.369834,RobertDowell,Love it.,"What a surprise App.  Works brilliantly in VR and you end up spending time just playing.  Love the effects that you can make with it and when adding music, things really hot up.

At £3.99 it's a no brainer, if you like messing with light.","Apr 10, 2018 at 10:12 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:54:00.445607,Fortytwoish,,"I've owned and used VR for a while, this is the first experience in a while to just make my jaw drop. I was giggling like a madman for a few minutes.","Apr 15, 2018 at 10:26 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:54:00.460567,StevieStone,Wow,"Best game I have played for VR, it syncs with your music!  Doesn't matter what player you use either..  Best purchase I've made and I can't wait to see what they have in store for the future of this great app.","Apr 2, 2018 at 5:27 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:54:00.476525,MaxB747,I just love it !,"I like so much this application, the particle effect is really more beautiful in reality with the oculus rift than on the Oculus store's video/pictures. Immersion is very nice.","Mar 14, 2018 at 1:14 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:54:00.490487,fyang0414,An amazing experience,"Such a great VR experience, on of my favorites. I wish there was music integration but with good background music, there are no issues at all, just sit back and become immersed","Feb 14, 2018 at 3:01 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:54:00.505447,FrontFoot,An INCREDIBLE experience,"This is not a game. It's a new way to listen to music that blows my mind each time I use it. Stick on a big banger, fiddle with the settings a bit and suddenly you have your personal lava lamp/trippy club experience. It's like nothing else. Wonderful.","Jan 11, 2018 at 7:57 AM",5, 1,
