2022-05-28 18:24:57.572144,Maura1129,Loved the 1st one....,"I really loved playing Dead Secret so I was so excited to play this sequel.  I'm not sure why the devs decided to change all of the controls, including the movement but this game made me so sick within the first few minutes that I will not go back to play it.  On top of that the cursor jumps from head driven to left control to right control to head again - VERY frustrating!","Jan 8, 2020 at 5:11 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 18:24:57.586107,Irengard,Great sequel with minor annoyances,"I loved the first Dead secret for it atmosphere, it's story and it's spookyness without the jump scares.  Dead secret Circle manages to keep all those elements while adding a longer storyline with more puzzles then the first.

The annoyances I have are only very minor.  1) you can't walk backwards and 2) the games switches between head aiming and oculus touch aiming.  It should only be hand tracking on the oculus rift.","May 7, 2019 at 7:49 AM",4, 2,

My Quick Thoughts:
A superb spooky murder mystery with a great atmosphere, story and immersion. Highly recommended.","Apr 9, 2019 at 4:35 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 18:24:57.616027,Plurr,Some technical drawbacks,"Good puzzle adventure. Good story, good atmosphere. At its heart, a proper VR title.

But there were frustrating low-quality elements. Getting stuck and ""slashed"" over and over was just a really bad experience. And the interactive dialog was sometimes poor. A lot of the stuff that was new from the previous title seemed poorly implemented. Any future title could do with a major overhaul. However, really simple graphics works rather well with a puzzle adventure.","Oct 7, 2018 at 9:15 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 18:24:57.631984,FMLPhoto,"Gripping, Scary, Bug Filled","Dead Secret Circle has you step into the shoes of Patricia, a reporter who is investigating disappearances in the early seventies.   You use your dreams to help find clues and missing people.

It's definitely worth the money, even if the bugs will make you question that at times.  Their engine is called Karloff and it's impressive tech - every character looks you in the eye while talking to you and their mouths actually make the shapes yours do when you talk.  You could literally lip read the characters in game and not miss anything.

There are some serious bugs though.  Often times I find myself blinded because the system thinks I've just stepped out of the map when all I was doing was standing still.  Sometimes you can hear characters talk to themselves in their apartment when you just watched them walk upstairs.  The cursor often changes, unprompted, from moving control from your controller to wherever you're looking.  Sometimes the cursor isn't displaying properly and shows the cursor at a  further depth than what it's resting on.  Your body floats below you, but sometimes it gets stuck and suddenly you're walking like a crab, looking over your shoulder.   In game triggers may go off, you may walk in silence, etc etc.  All of these would be a hard pass for me if Robot Invader wasn't constantly working on issues, or if the game wasn't so fun and imaginitive.

There is puzzle magazines everywhere where you can fill them out.  There are Nancy Drew-like books that are fun to read and there is a section where you can examine these childrens books for scary kids, where they turn Seven and The Shining into kids books.  There's lot to explore.

I really enjoyed the game (actually I hadn't finished it just yet - there's a portion of the game that spooked me good and I had to stop and write this review).  It's a charming indie game that still needs polishing, but I'm gonna keep my eye out for any upcoming games from the developer.","May 11, 2018 at 12:17 PM",4, 25,
