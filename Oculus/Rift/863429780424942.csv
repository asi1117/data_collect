2022-05-28 19:04:36.910292,nosevole,,"I bought this for my dad, who's 70 and loves history. This review is just pointers he brought up rather than my own. The narration he found irritating, too fast for him to properly absorb what was being said, and he picked up on a few inaccuracies though I'm afraid I've forgotten what those were. He didn't mind the early nineties sparse graphics, though he did get bored waiting a few minutes for the experience to finish once the narration had stopped and left him just sitting there. The narration was clearly designed to work through all experiences in order, which may explain things like off-pacing and bits of one experience leaking into the previous one. He said at one point that it reminded him of the reconstruction clips they put in old documentaries when 3D was new. 
Neither of us learnt anything new from the experience, but it's not absolutely awful. Just a bit... bare. Short. Lacking. It would be great to see something like this be made with Unreal, more immersive, and built like a full-length interactive documentary.","May 8, 2019 at 12:10 AM",2, 5,"Hi man, thanks for the review, hope you dad is enjoying VR it is very impressive that he is into it! Unfortunately we didn't had a big budget to increase too much the experience, it was meant to be introductory and I am sure that there are much more information that we could put into it, but budget constrains have locked us :(.
Anyway, we are planning a new update where you will have free roam for some of the levels, meaning that you can just walk around some of the Wonders, that should increase the immersion and time that you can spend there. BTW, this was made in Unreal, we just needed to cap some graphics because of performance issues.
Thanks again for your review and purchase."

2022-05-28 19:04:36.945199,SystemOfADL,,"Worth the dollar I spent on it.
There are no controls, it just played all the Wonders in a row after I selected the first one hands free.
And it looks like it came out of the 90s, but that is part of the charm for me.
Would have loved to be able to move around in the environments. 
Whoever programmed it clearly had fun with it.
No sure if the narrator was a person or a computer, but I don't think they got the pronunication right on some of these things.
I found it all very enjoyable, except the elevator at the mausoleum, my fear of hights did not like that :(","Apr 6, 2019 at 4:17 AM",3, 8,
2022-05-28 19:04:36.970132,Angelina Starr,Needs a little of everything,"Yes, it was only $1 USD but a review is a review of the product, not the cost of it.  

Needs some historical points tightened up.  And the narrator should look up the pronunciation of words if he is unaware or unsure, for example ""Cheops"".  Also, the graphics are very sub-par by today's standards.   Almost didn't finish the travelogue on that point alone.

The descriptor says it is Touch compatible.  I found no such compatibility.

I enjoy historical recreations in VR but unfortunately I don't think this one was ready for prime time.","Feb 18, 2019 at 9:34 AM",2, 9,"Thanks for the review. This experience indeed was created 3 years ago, so it is lacking the refinement of today's standards. The touch should work, if it is not I will call the team to work in that.
Thanks again for getting in touch with us!"

2022-05-28 19:04:40.135665,All-Gass-No-Breaks,"Great idea, But..","I have revised my review as it was not helpfull to the customer or developer.
7vr wonders is a great idea,  But the whole thing feels just so static.
It feels like your moving around cardboard cutouts of the 7 wonders instead of being made to feel like I was really there.
7vr wonders could be Great! But please update the graphics, make the surrounding landscape look more believable and add some weather FX.
For now I will give 7vr wonders three stars, but with a few tweeks, It could be five.","Jul 10, 2018 at 5:31 AM",3, 2,"Hi Whiplashed360, thanks for the review. We appreciate your honesty and would love to get a better feedback to understand why do you feel it to be as low quality. What you expected and how much you would be willing to pay for it. Please enter in contact through Facebook if possible, so we can align it better."
2022-05-28 19:04:40.151622,OoaliceoO,Very nice educational app,"Got it on sale, very well done! I can imagine these exact kind of apps to be used in educational contexts like in schools. Also nice to show-off the VR to elder people. Sure it's not cutting edge graphics and very short clips - for a higher price I'd expect optional, more detailed information -, but that is just the length which is ok to get a first impression on the topic, really not regretting this purchase.
While overall time to watch all the clips is only around 30 minutes I liked the different ideas of approaching the wonders, by foot, by boat... (no more spoilers...)","Jul 10, 2018 at 10:03 PM",5, 2,"Thanks for so kind compliment! You made us very happy with this nice words, hope you have enjoyed it!"
2022-05-28 19:04:43.253326,nightcat.mau,Fantastic Fun!,"This was awesome! It’s something I always wanted to do, to be at the seven wonders, not just read about them, and this is as close as I’ll ever get. This game has a lot going for it. For one, each wonder is almost like a theme park attraction. You will go on a flume ride in a garden, get thrown off a horse in Egypt and more!

Also, the scenery is quite pretty in some parts, though it does need free roam. I’ve noticed updates based on other reviews. There is now narration (which you can also turn off if you like) and the wonders autoplay on loop. I’d like to see touch and free locomotion in a future update.","Mar 24, 2018 at 2:36 AM",5, 5,"Hey nightcat! Really happy that you have liked the game!
Hope the game can get some traction so we have funds to improve it with the support for touch and free locomotion!
Thanks a lot for this review!"
2022-05-28 19:04:43.269284,XtremeHardcoreGamer,It's okay.,"I like the idea of virtual tourism through time and space- and would love to see more apps in this genre. That being said, I feel as though the execution could have been better in this particular experience. Not bad for the sale price of $1.00. Also, the historical accuracy in some of the depiction might be off- for example the Colossus of Rhodes having split legs. I know that no one knows for sure, and I am no expert- but I remember seeing somewhere that structurally and practicality-wise, that would've been unlikely. Also, the boat fun ride through the Hanging Gardens. IDK, not an expert. I would also like to have seen more graphical fidelity, even if embellished, as of now many of the statues have a low poly aesthetic which doesn't gel well with awe and wonder.

I do like the water effects. I like the presentation, too- like the build up to Zeus, or the approaching the pyramids by horse. I also enjoyed the narration although I felt it could've had more content.","Apr 14, 2018 at 1:18 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:04:43.284245,cigaremoods,,"I am french, my English is not very good. The graphim is limited, we can do much better.  Moving human characters are unrealistic.  I regret not being able to move myself to visite the sites.","Apr 3, 2018 at 7:48 PM",2, 2,"No worries, your english is not bad at all. Thanks for your review! The graphics could not be pushed much higher since we do have the concern to have a high framerate for required cards (960 GTX). We wanted to make a free roam option, but involves a lot of work. Maybe we can do it in the future if the app does get some positive feedback."
2022-05-28 19:04:43.299204,Jribs52,Buy on Sale. But Awesome.,"It's price may be justified, but if you're like me, there's a ton of 8 dollar apps. Got this for a dollar and was worth it. It's incredible to actually see the ancient wonders of the world and the 3d was polished.","Mar 29, 2018 at 9:18 AM",5, 2,"Hey Jirbs,
Thank you so much for this amazing review! We hope you had a great time travelling through time ;)."
2022-05-28 19:04:43.313167,cybernettr,Perfect concept for VR,"I personally think VR will be used for learning about history a lot more in the future, so this fits right in. Not the level of graphical sophistication you would expect in hight-end games, but it does give you a sense of what it was like to be there. Intresting to compare this with other artists' conceptions of the 7 Wonders printed in books. However, I read that the conception that the Colossus of Rhodes had its legs astride the entrance was a MYTH.","Dec 12, 2017 at 1:04 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:04:46.433820,JCat,"Even on sale, a bit overpriced","Grabbed it on sale, but it's one of those one shot experiences. Very basic stuff here. Click a wonder, then sit back as it takes you around by foot, boat, horse...etc. Zero interaction, so once you've seen all 7, there's no reason to go back unless you have guests who you want to show it off to. The Babylon Gardens, Zeus and Colossus Of Rhodes are probably the best of the 7. The Giza pryamid visuals are completely lackluster and crude. Some scenes just look washed out. It has its moments.... especially the canoe through Babylon Gardens and dramatic intro to the statue of Zeus. Overall, fairly well done for the 20 minutes or so time it will take to see it all.","Jun 24, 2017 at 8:02 AM",3, 6,"Thanks for the review! We based our prince in other 20min experiences, but it is a great feedback! Hope you enjoyed! As I said, we are working to make also a free roam experience for it!"
2022-05-28 19:04:46.448780,fariazz,Incredibly beautiful,Amazing job with the rendering and creation of these environments. I'm an ancient world nerd so it was really cool being able to see these places in this manner. My favorite one was the Babylon gardens. Cheers!,"May 30, 2017 at 1:33 PM",5, 3,"Hi Fariz, thanks for the review! We are about to release an update with voice over so I hope you can enjoy it!

Kind regards!"
2022-05-28 19:04:46.463740,Flyingsailor,Beautiful but vague,"I can see that this app is beautifully rendered when at close range, with a great sense of scale. As soon as objects are more than 1-2metres away things get a bit blurry. I did not manage to sharpen the image by pressing + on my keyboard although I run a GTX1080 machine. Some more explanation how to improve the graphics please!!","May 25, 2017 at 1:36 AM",3, 1,"Hi Flyingsailor, thanks for the review! When using + it should increase your pixel density of the game, making things sharper. There were limits to that (around 1.4x the normal pd), we will try to make this limits go away so things could get even more defined."
2022-05-28 19:04:46.479698,ManMythLegend,Enjoyable!,"It's been a dream to visit the 7 wonders of the ancient world, so this app is literally a dream come true. A surprising amount of care has went into these scenes, each about a minute and a half long using some sort of transport. But they're nicely framed in a grounded way which gives a more full taste to the world they're a part of. The graphics are a bit blurry, which at first was surprising, but I think gives it a water color quality that I ended up enjoying. Found the Hanging Gardens especially mesmerizing, as I never understood why this would be a wonder, but was transported there for a brief bit. I noticed the developer response that narration would be added and I think this would help add even more. I might also recommend a 'play all' option and the ability to view the models on one's own. It may also help to note the increase in resolution feature in the menu, as I only saw this after visiting all scenes. But overall, a delightful experience made with care and excited to see it grow just a bit further!","May 7, 2017 at 5:45 AM",5, 3,

We are going to check if there is any asset or compression that is not working on it! But in fact as we work with only static lights that are built upon textures the size of it is probably right. We are working to make it a free roam experiences as well."

I hope you have liked it. We are recording some voice over to give some story about each one of the Wonders and if you have a very good machine you can press + to increase the resolution of the application!"
