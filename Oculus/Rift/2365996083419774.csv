2022-05-28 19:40:07.207254,blueperfluous,,"The graphic rendering of the planetary objects' surfaces is very good, expecially the probes/landers/sattelites, but the dust and stones look a little ""blobby"" up close. I loved being able to to get an in-action view of and experience of the probe around Saturn, and those on the surfaces of Venus, Titan, and a Comet. The cross section of Enceledus showing its sub-surface ocean was a plus. There are much better VR experiences for Mars and the Moon though. The lack of a menu, drop-in points, or any control markings is frustrating. Advancing to the next scene is often difficult and confusing. This would be a perfect addition to the much superior ""Titans of Space"" VR experience. As a stand-alone, it's low price makes it worth downloading.","Jun 14, 2020 at 6:05 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 19:40:07.223211,jamesd256,,"How anyone can criticise this is beyond me.  I came for epic solar system experiences.  I got what I came for.  

This has been done with real care for the viewer's sense of awe and wonder.  Ten stars from me for the price.","Jun 7, 2020 at 8:39 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:40:07.238171,michael.lubuguin,Good VR experience,"An overall enjoyable little space exploration VR experience with decent graphics and some fun facts about various space exploration missions and info on planets. This could use a few more locations and I really wish that there was an option for full locomotion and smooth turning to make moving along the surface of the different locations more immersive (I hate teleportation and snap turning). But if you're interested in space, it's worth a pickup (when it goes on sale).","Jul 21, 2019 at 1:08 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:40:07.254129,toddeklof,,"For me, this is what VR is about! I love being on worlds I never thought imaginable. I'm greedy though, and hope there are more journeys to come. Thanks to the developers for transporting me to the surface of some of our nearest galactic neighbors! Truly astonishing!","Jun 3, 2019 at 1:25 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 19:40:10.370904,ParadiseDecay,Both Good and Standard experiences here.,"My Initial Thoughts:
Some impressive set pieces mixed with some generic ones, which I have seen done better in similar experiences.
