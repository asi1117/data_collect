2022-05-28 18:13:05.425880,johnad194,Great experience,"My wife and I have put hours into this, even after beating it we continue even if just to mess around in the environment and look for more oragami birds. This is a well thought out escape room game and it is well worth the price. Experienced no bugs and has worked well on rift cv1 and rift s for me, on low end and high end gpus with good performance.","Apr 18, 2020 at 4:55 AM",5, 7,
