2022-05-28 18:04:02.123021,Poke6451,"Fun and Free, but...","I play this game mainly for the hide and seek minigame but there are a few other games that are just as fun. In my opinion, I think that it's well developed experience and it functions well with little to no bugs from I can tell. The only issue being the lack of players. Iv'e had this game for a little over year now and the amount of time it takes to get into a match is still a little frustrating (usally 5-8 minutes per). Personally, I think it's a fun game to chill out and have fun, so I think it's worth the download :)",Feb 26 at 3:09 AM,5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:04:02.136983,Derpyrift,love it! but needs a bit more,"i love this game! but it needs a little bit more like worlds, things to do, etc. for example, i feel like a flower field would be nice! or maybe adding more to the sea area! i feel like it would be a amazing game if they added more to the game. but either way i love this game!","Apr 26, 2021 at 2:09 AM",4, 19,
2022-05-28 18:04:02.152941,beastmat,G O O D very    but kinda lacks,"really fun but I think it be better if there was custom gamemodes

i get its for social stuff and I respect that but still lacking

2022-05-28 18:04:05.318474,Level_314,Must have  online free game,"This is a good starter game for those that are new to VR, it's free and pretty fun! It could use more games though.","Dec 29, 2020 at 7:54 AM",4, 11,
2022-05-28 18:04:05.332437,Inverrtted,Fun,Really innovative gameplay in some of the modes. The hide and seek is very fun.,"Dec 29, 2020 at 11:26 PM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 18:04:05.347397,AShFAL,Fun but lacking,"It could be such a fun game but it misses a few things to be good. First of all players. I was expecting to meet many players when the game released but when I launched the 'lobby' was empty. The second thing is things to do/explore. There are 6 'games/worlds' which each take 15min to fully explore/play. 

This game could be so much fun but lacks things which make it a 1-hour game and never touch it again. It is fun with friends nonetheless. However a 1 time thing to do.

UPDATE: The devs did a great job retouching some elements, like seeing how many people are online overall and how many are in each game/room. This really helps finding other players. Also all people seem to join the same lobby now. This makes it way more social then before. I changed my 2 star rating to a 4. It just lacks the playerbase and more games but fun nonetheless. Great game for a couple of hours fun with random stangers or friends!","Mar 7, 2020 at 6:21 PM",4, 14,
2022-05-28 18:04:05.361360,Linkums,Super cute and you should play it,I was smiling and dancing and I played hide and seek where I was smol and others were giant. *wiggly arms*,"Mar 1, 2020 at 10:39 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 18:04:08.482013,Aprilllllll,such a great game,"Oh my god, I love this quirky little game. There are such wholesome interactions here. although my only gripe is the sort of ""bubble"" that appears when you're in the lobby. Its very strict, and other players completely disappear when you get close, including nametags.","Dec 22, 2019 at 7:50 PM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 18:04:08.496973,Skuppo,I gave like 20 people high fives,"My first interaction in this game was an extremely short blob walking up to me and extending his hand upward towards me, I gave him high five and he shook with excitement. Very wholesome. The games are also super fun besides the fact some are hard to find lobbies for. Other than that a good wholesome experience","Dec 27, 2019 at 9:33 AM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 18:04:08.525895,InSaine,Best game ever.,"Literally the best game ever, and its free. Why are you reading reviews, go play!","Dec 23, 2019 at 6:35 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:04:08.539858,greggman,No one is playing - Can't play alone,"Just bought the game. No idea that ""required"" other players. Stood by each door for 2 minutes waiting for other players (clicked play, said 1/4 players, waited). No one. So yea, just spent $15 and got zero out of it. 😡","Sep 27, 2019 at 12:04 PM",1, 16,
2022-05-28 18:04:11.633583,Arkitecc,A super wholesome and fun game!,"Half + Half is a super wholesome and fun game with sweet vibes! I had a lot of fun playing with a friend of mine who purchased at the same time I did, looking forward to playing with a larger group when I can. This definitely is an inherently social experience though, so its replay value will depend on how much you enjoy the minigames, and how many friends you can tag along with! I hope to see more content added in the future!","Sep 14, 2019 at 10:11 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 18:04:11.647546,SushiRollVR,,"Don't get me wrong, this game is super fun. I love the games and the look of the players. Unfortunately, it does not take long for the game be ""beaten"" and there are very few things to do. It is fun to play with friends, but other than that there is rarely anyone online even after they updated the matchmaking algorithm. I really hope more people jump in and they add a lot more games and features (like an options menu)","Sep 21, 2019 at 9:49 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 18:04:11.662506,Gdaytoyamates,"Amazing, but there's no one to play with","This game is wonderfull and really fun WHEN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALY ON!

2022-05-28 18:04:11.692426,Bodhi_Cohen,fun but no one's around,Where did everyone go? also i can only hear lalalala instead of people talking its strange,"Sep 14, 2019 at 8:40 AM",2, 4,"Heyo, Max the developer here, give it another shot! We've updated our matchmaking logic to wait until we find you a match. Also, the lalala voice scrambling is on purpose. If you add someone as a friend, we turn it off :)"

2022-05-28 18:04:14.822055,miketucker,"Quirky, fun, and beautiful shared games","A nice range of short games and environments for chilling with friends. Each of the worlds are beautifully designed with a nice minimal visual and musical aesthetic. Some of these I would have never guessed would have been compelling or possible in VR-- like a sidescroller or hang-gliding. Out of all of them, Hide & Seek plays with scale and exploration in a way that truly captures the best aspects of VR.","Sep 14, 2019 at 8:35 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:04:14.838013,nickladd,Super Fun *with friends,Even with only one friend this game is a blast! It's cross compatible between Rift/Quest too. Not a ton of content but the content that's here is super polished and enjoyable! Would love to see more games added!,"Sep 14, 2019 at 9:25 AM",5, 4,
