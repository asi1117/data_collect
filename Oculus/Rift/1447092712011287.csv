2022-05-28 18:46:36.991687,DeathAdder71,How hard can it be to watch Ready Player,"... One? ... The answer is: Very

Until I bought this software ... Best 1 buck I ever spent
Finally a proper Video Player that works out of the box, plays all video formats, detects the proper video aspect ratio and sends the audio to the A/V Receiver without converting it into Stereo like other programs

The dashboard is excellent, no BS features, everything you need is at your fingertips without the need to open menus and new windows

All the Free players I tried always lack something, as if they are not intended for Cinema (virtual) experience

I liked it so much I couldn't give it 4 stars, because there are some (minor) issues ... NOTE before reading next, don't let anything I say below distract you from how Solid that Player is, they are all really minor issues from a very picky customer :D

- Need more seating options; the middle seat is a bit close to my liking and the back seat is too far away, we need a seat in between them or a method to customize the seat location

- It does not save the played file settings, it always start as Flat, so each time I play any 3D movie, I must set the 3D mode (SBS or OU)

- No documentation, I had to figure out what keys to press on my Oculus Rift S Controller to work the dashboard

- No Skip feature on the controller either, which is kind of annoying to have to use the dashboard everytime I want to go a few seconds FWD or BKWD

I'll say it again, it is a [ 5 ] Star software esp at that price, don't let my comments fool you, I just wrote them for clarity and to entice the developer(s) to add some good features

btw, for anyone who says he can't play a specific video format, please update your video codecs and install LAV Filters as well, because this software did play all the formats I threw at it",Dec 23 at 9:49 AM,5, 1,

2022-05-28 18:46:37.021607,Bitkiller,No .mkv playing,"I bought the player because the description says, that it can play .mkv-files. It doesn´t.","Jun 11, 2021 at 4:54 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 18:46:37.036568,JDThird,Played everything I threw at it,"So far, this has worked well.  Every MKV I threw at it played fine with sound.

Only reason not 5 stars - seating position, as so many others have mentioned.  Really needs better options.  I'd also like an option to do a quick skip forward / back, like maybe the triggers or something.  Left trigger skips backwards, right trigger skips forward, or the sticks or something.

But other than the UI wishes, from the simply functional aspect, this is the one to get.  I've had the Oculus since the initial release, and it sat for the last year or so until I picked up the new Oculus Rift S now, and decided to start watching movies sometimes.  I tried many of the other programs, even had to do a return for one that was so bad...  This one, I wish I had found far earlier than I did...

And for a buck and change after taxes?  Wow!","Dec 30, 2019 at 1:21 PM",4, 2,"Thanks very much for your review.

2022-05-28 18:46:40.221050,MikeInBoston,Love it!,"Worth more than a buck! I've tried all of the cinema apps from Cineveo, Cmoar, Bigscreen to Skybox, but this one is the one I'll use over the rest of them. My only wish is to be able to sit anywhere in the theater. But that's pretty much my only complaint, which is not really a complaint lol. This app checks more boxes than there other ones for sure. Looking forward to see what's added in future updates. Good stuff!","May 25, 2019 at 8:57 PM",5, 5,Thank you very much for your words.
2022-05-28 18:46:40.236010,minhpd.87,The app offer lots of options however,"The seating option need to be tweaked, the first-two seat position is way too close to the screen and I had to keep my head up (which strains the neck) just to see the screen. The third seat options is way too far from the screen and that takes away the big screen feeling in a cinema. Can you like, make a separate seat selection UI (just like the seat selection UI when booking your ticket online) and let us choose any available seats (or just the middle column but any seats /any rows) instead of just 3 options (9 seats but I am counting as 3 in term of distance to the screen). Thank you very much! Sorry for rating this as 3.0 stars but I can't comfortably sit through the whole movie with current seating position :(

Edit: or maybe you can change the seat height instead? the screen size of the 2nd seat position is just right, but having to look up to watch is painful","Jun 16, 2019 at 10:30 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:46:40.250970,ZX_RetroGamer,Finally found a Cinema Experience in VR,"Had a few of these, some worked ok, some just didn't work. However this works PERFECTLY ! Choose your seat. Easily select a movie, which seems to support mkv flawlessly, and it cost less than a buck ?  Seems too good to be true. My most used app on the Rift and it only cost a buck ! Well done to the team that made this.","Feb 17, 2019 at 9:03 AM",5, 2,"Thank you very much, your words make me very happy.

2022-05-28 18:46:43.369629,TheRedEngineer,Best cinema app on the store.Recommended,"Not only this is the cheapest cinema app, it also is the best one on the store right now.
The video quality in the actual cinema screens is actually very good. I have a similar app that I paid around 10£ (a lot more than this app) and the upper part of the screen was a bit fuzzy while here the screens actually preserve quality.
I like the fact that there are different environments that you can choose such as a classic cinema room, an alien room, a space ""room"" and an amphitheater (hopefully I haven't missed any) but the thing that I like most is that YOU CAN SELECT YOUR SEATS! A feature that I didn't see in any other cinema app. This is very useful because you can choose what position is most comfortable for you. When watching movies I use this feature a lot.
Other things to mention is that the UI is actually very well done and intuitive and you can always hide it or bring it back. Some other options are the possibility to curve the screen, access files straight from your computer or increase or decrease the brightness inside the various rooms.

One little issue that I had is that when I try to watch movies from the windows app of Netflix, I can hear the audio but the screen remains black and sometimes the app freezes. I had no issues while watching netflix from the browser so I think that there's an incompatibility with the netflix windows app. It's not a big deal but I thought that it was worth mentioning it. I code stuff as well and it is always appreciated when people send feedback on possible issues so I can bring a better product.

That being said, If you are unsure which cinema app to buy, definitely chose this one. It's way better and also cheaper than the other ones.","Nov 17, 2018 at 9:32 AM",5, 2,"Thank you very much for your comment, I am very happy that you like it.

2022-05-28 18:46:43.400546,Abe.Normal.718,I love this app!!!,"This is a fantastic app for watching movies that you have on your computer.   It truly feels like I'm watching a movie in my own private theater.  And it even plays 3d blu rays!!!  And the ability to switch into a ""desktop mode"" is great too.  Thank you dev for this.  

If I had one nit pick, I wish the volume could go higher.   Even at 100%, it's doesn't seem very loud.  At least not movie theater loud.","Jul 18, 2018 at 7:11 AM",5, 0,"Hi, thanks very much for your words.

2022-05-28 18:46:43.415506,syelent,Pretty bad,"This is bad. There are free video plays better than this one, and i know 1 dollar isnt a lot, but come on. The controls are wonky with the oculus controllers. There are not alot of settings comared to ANY decent free player.","Jul 31, 2018 at 10:00 AM",1, 0,"Sorry, you can request a refund at Oculus."
2022-05-28 18:46:46.522197,wavyeye,Almost,"The best feature is it will play 3D MKV Blu Ray rips, which is the main reason I got it for. My huge active 3D TV is sharper but does suffer from some ghosting on darker scenes, the Rift by its very nature has perfct 3D so thats great. Also bonus, better colour fidelity as there are no green glasses.
However the recenter option does not work properly. All viewing options in all the rooms has the screen high like a real theater, this is stupid. My neck hurts holding my gaze up at an angle for any length of time. Please make the recenter view change to where you are actually looking and not just left and right.
I'm at home, not in a tiny cinema seat, I'm going to move around, slouch a bit, I might even want to lie down.
Most VR driving games get this right, the recenter click will focus on where your head is pointing.","Mar 10, 2018 at 10:02 AM",3, 11,

2022-05-28 18:46:49.693714,duskdiver,Most used app! Beats the other Cinema ap,"UPDATE 12/31/17: After the bug fixes this is the best app to simulate being in a movie theater.  It even beats Big Screen (which always crashes and has bugs).  If I could make a request it'd to be able to open files on the network drives (like Skybox or Big Screen).   That would make this app unbeatable and perfect.  As it is now it is a 5-star app.
-------------------------
The Good: The dimensions and distance is perfect for watching videos -- you really feel like you're at a movie theater.

The Not-so-Good: First, wish there was support for mkv files.  But most important, when watching some videos, if you skip ahead, the video and audio becomes out of sync.  (I've tested with this app and media players).  Also there doesn't seem to be any way to activate or switch subtitles or audio for files that have it.  Once they fix the bugs, have subtitle/audio support and can play mkv files, this would be a perfect 5-star app to watch videos - I'd even give up the big screen TV","Jan 1, 2018 at 7:13 AM",5, 4,"Thank you very much for your words.

It'd be even better if you could have a few random characters sat in the cinema with you?

I set it to Ultra and the video is sharp & clear. 1 star taken because 1. there are only 3 interior setting, frankly beside the first one, the other 2 was not my liking at all. 2. The screen is too large, I just wish it can set to a smaller size.","Nov 2, 2017 at 7:27 AM",4, 1,"Hi, thanks very much for your review.

2022-05-28 18:46:52.812373,RuneSR2,Your own cinema,"This app is simply awesome, it works with MKV among other formats and the sound is great. The image quality is probably as good as possible on the Rift CV1, so unless other developers can do some real magic, this is probably as good for viewing your movies at home as it'll ever be on the Rift. It's simply like being in a giant cinema, you can choose where to sit, and using Ultra video quality I've had no problems seeing MKVs and other format. Did have one sound issue, but the devs sent out a patch two days later and now all my movies seem to work. 3D should be working too, but I haven't tested 3D yet.","Oct 30, 2017 at 5:36 AM",5, 2,"Hi RuneSR2, thanks very much for your review.

Your app has all these customisable with a really easy to use interface/control system. The screen is too high for the first two seat rows and I agree with the guy who said you could put a few heads here and there to make it more atmospheric. One of the Big Screen auditoriums has these. Plays all my 3D including one other players had problems with and subtitles and language tracks seem to show up correctly. Great app.","Oct 22, 2017 at 7:37 AM",5, 2,"Thanks very much for your review. I will continue to improve the application.

2022-05-28 18:46:52.844288,bri_tar,Cinema how it should be...,Lets be fair and honest - the best way to experience the big screen is on your own and with as limited number of people in there with you as possible (with little people being an exception of course)... I can do that now. Whenever i want - and with all the visual media I love! This app is the absolute nuts and i'd pay more monies everytime it gets updated. Happily!
