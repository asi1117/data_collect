I'm pretty sure that it uses random generation for the rooms because it starts differently every time and not from where I left off. I quit after encountering the exact same room four times in a row. With a good amount of polish it could be a fun distraction, but right now it's just not there.","Jun 8, 2017 at 7:05 AM",2, 3,
