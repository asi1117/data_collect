2022-05-28 14:28:41.605359,alien126,Insanely immersive,"This is by far the best spaceship simulation i have ever played. I do not get how sht games like everspace vr or Star Wars Squadron get so much praise. There was 0 immersion in that games bcause u had to use keyboard and mouse/gamepad. Controllers that u cannot see ingame and it feels so bad. 

A completly different thing with this game.. Immersion is insane. especially bcause the controls feel so natural, the graphic looks great. I dreamed to be in space since im a lil kid, this game legit gave me that feeling. If you like to be in a spaceship going arround in space, you need to buy this 100%. I play on an Occulus touch on a high-end pc.","Jan 24, 2021 at 8:38 AM",5, 27,

If you are reading this and plan to play on the Rift S; find something else...  This is most likely a great game, but the control support for the Oculus Touch is for the original touch controllers, not the Rift S (or Quest) touch controllers.  I wish I had known, I wish I had read the reviews.  But with the gaming community being on of such hate these days, I tend to check out gameplay videos and risk it based on what I see, never what is said (or written).  This time it bit me...
I hate to rate the devs hard work poorly, I really do, but this with the Rift S is bad!  I apologize devs, but this is just simple truth.","Sep 25, 2019 at 11:06 AM",1, 139,

2022-05-28 14:28:44.799543,SwashBlade,"Control ok with mouse + keyboard, but...","As space games go, this one had promise.  The non-VR was decent after some major updates and most of those changes are reflected in the VR version.  Unfortunately most of the main content is missing.  The story is gone entirely, replaced with a very loose thread of ""rebuilding your ship after pirates took it"" that seems to get dropped immediately with no resolution.  Visiting stations, arguably one of the more unique aspects of the standard version, has been almost completely gutted.  Stations are now locked, restricting you to the landing pad.  While you can sometimes find a ""mission"" allowing you to pay for station access, doing this only shows that the station interior is almost completely uninhabited.  Worse is that some mechanics vital for upgrading your ship are missing entirely.  You can contact them from space, get directions to find them, land at the specified port and then get directed to return to space where you'll be told to land again.  Poorly tested and completely unsupported months after release.","Mar 31, 2018 at 9:30 PM",2, 66,
2022-05-28 14:28:44.814503,dreatern,A good game,"X Rebirth is not a game for people looking for a flight simulator or a pew pew space action game. The game is about empire building and fleet management.

Yes, you will pilot only one ship but that ship can be upgrated in many ways, engine, shield, software, weapons and cockpit (The cockpit will change the ship internal appearance, the thing you will see in vr). So, the alterations you can do to the ship will make you feel you are piloting different ships.
You can also have a fleet with tons of different ships with different proposes and you give orders to the crew. you can also land in some ships and walk around and so on.

It is a sandbox game,  you will play by yourself and you will freely choose your allies and enemies and set your own objectives (Missions and events are also incluided).

You can use the Touch controller, Joystick/HOTAS or Gamepad, it will take time to adapt or get used to it but after that everything will be smooth. 

The negative point of the game is the interface, little was done to really adapt the UI/UX to be intuitive in VR. It is the same interface as the ""flat"" version (which by itself is is not good), as it is a management game, there are lots of menus and texts.
You have a flat UI floating in front of you with extra windows that open in the console panel on your right side (poorly positioned forcing you to turn your head all the way to the right). The novelty in VR is an extra radial menu with quick access to some actions.
The ""bad"" UI/UX is kinda acceptable since the game is a desktop port.

---Is it for you?

-If you are looking for a space flight simulator, pew pew or something more action oriented and fast, X Rebirth is not for you.
 
-If you like management, trade, building, production with a mix of combat, faction relations and trade competitors in a sci-fi universe with endless amount of gameplay and content, this is the game for you.

2022-05-28 14:28:44.829463,Demonessa,Is good,"So, as I understood it's a bit cut version of XR game, adopted to VR.  It does look nice, has  a good gameplay, and being a sandbox game drawed my attention. But lacks a few things.  As mention in  other review, some controls aren't  adapted for Oculus Touch - I'd prefer to reach for  those menu buttons(displays) with my own hand, instead of trying pointing at them, making  me go through a whole sequence of finger moves ( release both triggers,  touch  trigger,  release trigger  .... ok looks like pointing now... now press that  A button and watch out for your other hand not to accidentaly activate pointing), resolved this by mapping ""left hand trigger rest"" to some useless, not working option - camera zoom, now always got only right hand pointing -comfortable. And one more thing - extensions.  For those who dont know, it's a modding capability,  you can find many mods on  Steam.... which you cannot download if you bought a game throw Oculus Store ( correct me if I'm wrong).  Also many mods work from original XR game.  Anyways , despite some awkward controls I really liked that game, but be warned, if you start it, you will not  be finished in just few hours of gameplay ....
Edit: the Detail Screen (on your right) is very bad placed, makes you turn your head 90 degrees to the right to see it. Egosoft could have done something to make it comfortable -  either make it slide out exactly in front of you, or change player camera position on activation of that monitor (there are files in game  already, which work on non-VR version, i guess )","Jan 26, 2019 at 2:26 AM",4, 12,

2022-05-28 14:28:47.945199,William91367,Meh,So far I am not impressed. The story line seems to get lost almost imediately. Game play is mostly a mystery. You have to guess your way along. I have missions that I have no idea how to complete. Controls feel clunky but I am finally getting a feel for them. This is something I don't like in games. I have no feeling of direction. Pretty much rudderless. OK what next.,"Jan 8, 2018 at 2:17 PM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 14:28:47.960159,E_Dreamer,Tell us what to do !,"I spent a long time just (fruitlessly) trying to figure out how to dock with the initial station. I've still no idea how to do it. The ""tutorials"" you are told to expect told me briefly how to move the ship and then NADA. I could bring up the radial menu but no idea how to select (in this case ""Dock"") pressing A just made the menu dissapear again ! On the game menu then there is a Tutorial's section. Great, or so I thought. No these load up youtube videos explaining complex matters about the game, even the 1st one. No help at all when you don't yet know the basics. Worst still you only hear the sound, as it's actually a youtube tutorial that plays on your monitor. You won't see it wearing the VR headset and nothing warns you this is so.

2022-05-28 14:28:47.977114,JohnnyLee,Great VR game,"Big fan of the old X series by these guys. Also been playing Elite Dangerous since day one so I have an idea of what a great space sim is. Great job on the VR version. Only real gripe I have is when walking around on the platforms, turning left or right makes me a bit dizzy. I would prefer snapping left/right when turning like From Other Suns does it. This option would elimnate motion sickness in this game for a lot of us. The station designs are awesome and not a lot of reptition. If you have the patience to learn the game, it's great fun for sure. Hundreds of hours of sandbox. Runs smooth as butter on my GTX970. Touch controllers are great with this game! Super intuitive. Cannot go back to HOTAS and will leave that for Elite. Well done Egosoft.","Jan 5, 2018 at 10:57 PM",5, 2,

Neat game though I kept getting bugged during the tutorials (or would have 4 -5 stars) so getting started was a little tricky.  ""Try opening the Zone map"" was as far as the tutorials could get me (part 4 of 15 or something).  Despite opening the zone map in all 4 ways, it just kept spamming that requirement.

Same bugs from day 1. Can not remove hmd and go to 2d so you can remap and play with keybinds.

The documentation can be found here: https://www.egosoft.com:8444/confluence/display/XRWIKI/X+Rebirth+VR+Edition+User+Manual

The Oculus store requires the game to be paused when taking off the headset (rationale: so people don't get stressed because the game is running and drop their expensive headset, trying to be quick - which does make sense). You can simply unpause the game by pressing the pause-key on your keyboard. We'll update the documentation to make this more clear."

2022-05-28 14:28:51.118313,jjGuardian,Wow what a mistake!,"It only got 2 stars because it didn't crash.
The graphics are horrible, texture stretching everywhere. Interface is completely counter intuitive.. Release the trigger to point at things and press ""A"" to select but becareful not to touch the trigger in the other hand or the pointer switches hands.
Enter the game in the tutorial and it wont stop drifting to the left.
Look at the map and everytime my finger makes contact with the right trigger, the picture in my right eye flickers.
Nothing makes any sense.

It patched I I went back and tried again.
The interface problems are not only worse, they're broken in VR entirely.

This is a game from the mid 2000's that was a PC Space economy game which they've been trying to keep alive with DLCs and appealing to the masses. They VR'd it which is to say the game has nothing VR specific going for it.

You are fighting against the NPC for all resources but the NPCs can purchase the nanosecond they're available. Its like dealing with a scalper bot buying up all the concert tickets.
Resourcing problems date back to 2013 on their own forums and last week the statement came out on a resourcing bug thread ""It's not a priority"". This was reasonable only in that the most recent patch completely broke the graphic textures (things can turn all green) and the menu systems in a game with heavy menu interaction (you try to pick a mission from a dialog menu. Game hangs for a bit and the dialog vanishes so you have to make your selection again.. rinse and repeat) and random crashes.

Great concept, I was really hopeful but at this point it has no business being in VR and its a 10+ year old program thats been frankenstein'd together to keep it making money. There are so many small bugs now not only can the developers not fix them without damaging something else, there are a community of zelots who have figured out how to work with the bugs who support them.

Too many hours trying to make my purchase not be a mistake. FAIL","Sep 17, 2017 at 6:44 AM",2, 8,

I keep rewriting this review. The game is complex, menus deep. but flying around is good. Enivronments ok, close up, but blurry from a distance.

The thumb sensor, ship nav takes time.

just wish there was peddle axis support [confirmed it is supported].

Not regrets purchasing it, but it is a little rough around the edges.

[Response to developer]

Hello Dev,

Thank you for responding. I tried again, yes my peddles where detected this time.


Regarding menus, please check Star Trek Bridge commander for a more VR friendly approach, the finger pointer can be fiddly.

thanks for the feedback. Please explain what kind of support you wish for? There are a lot of possibilities through the joystick options which can be combined with the VR controls!"
2022-05-28 14:28:54.240040,Jalapino,Fantastic Experience !,"This is without doubt the best VR experience I have had yet. The game is HUGE with lots to see and do. I have played the original pc version so I was very familiar with the game world and the gameplay mechanics. I would suggest starting on easy and in free mode. Then spend some time setting up your controller and saving the controller profile. Next, scan the i icons on the nearest station, this will unlock commisions which show up as other types of icons which are missions. Accept the easy missions and follow the yellow markers. This should get you started and ease you into the game.The touch contollers are way too fiddly so I use an Xbox one controller and it all works just fine, although a bit of button reconfiguring was required. It all runs very smoothly on a gtx 1080ti and also a gtx 1080.  This game takes a bit of getting into but I stuck with it and was rewarded with with some of the best Vr gameplay I have yet experienced. Overall this is a beautiful immersive game and is everything I thought it would be. Well done Egosoft... I love you !","Sep 24, 2017 at 6:11 PM",5, 5,

Latest update fixed the worst issues, glitches etc, and I prefer the gameplay loops in this over Elite Dangerous. However, the whiplash inducing monitor 90* to your right has not been fixed, the UI is still a Frankenstein mish mash of three different control types along with numerous control annoyances - and still quite a few graphical glitches (non stereo issues etc).

After jumping in my ship, I was in an uncontrollable spin. Grabbed commands, managed to stay straight, but had to apply constant pressure on controls. Every time I leave them, the ship spins back again. Probably something related to my HOTAS, but how to fix it it's still a mistery.

While a bit hard at first, using them is really the best way to handle the ship. They are as precise and fast as a mouse, and they make a very good use of the buttons and gestures. On VR, even station walking is pretty fun, since you can stand up from the chair and walk around, and they are fairly interesting to see (they could be vastly improved by adding windows to see outside). The game still needs improvment: menu handling for example, should be more intuitive, and enemy targeting should be automatic, since there are not enough buttons to map it.  After-update crash can be solved by updating oculus and then updating graphics card drivers.","Sep 12, 2017 at 11:00 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 14:28:57.432082,RonnieLongFDA,By far the worst space sim I've played,"Just trying to get through the first tutorial I almost needed an airsick bag. Everytime you look at anything that's not directly in front of you for more than a moment, the camera shifts your view so that you're now looking straight ahead. It's a nauseating jump in your view and I haven't been able to find any way to stop it, to lock the camera in place. I'll wait for the next update to come out and try again, but for now I can't give it more than a 1 star rating.","Aug 12, 2017 at 10:53 AM",1, 6,"This definitely sounds like a bug. There is a key mapping to reset the view if you hold down that button for longer and the way you are describing it sounds like this button is accidentally held down all the time?

2022-05-28 14:28:57.448040,kurzonmorris,Good but deffinatly early access,"Okay i'm still early on in the game about 2-3 hours and so far feels pretty good. I do have some issues and the main one is the game freezes for about a minute at random points in time. In a normal game that would be frustrating but in VR its headache inducing, I suspect this will improve in time but its still something to consider. 

My main issue is i have no idea what i'm doing. the active mission tells me to fix up the ship but doesn't give me any more than that. This game is DEFFINATLY NOT for the pick up and go people, you have to invest time and effort into making it work and understanding it. I have so far learned how to scan stations, fight, fly and complete basic missions and all those are interesting and fun. Another issue is the speed at which you can turn when you are on foot, you can get quite nauseous with the speed of the turning.

For those who are having problems getting the game to run, I had the same issue but an updated driver later and it worked straight away, so deffinatly give that a try.

In conclussion (i'll update as i play) the game is looking good except for the two issues (one is a real problem). If you like this kinda game elite, star citizen, x. then  you are likely to like this kinda game and will probably be willing to invest the time to learn how to play and then enjoy what the x universe has to offer. If you are new to the genre then I'd suggest holding off for now, the problems will likely put you off the game and the genre for good. If you want to try the genre then I'd suggest either play other x games (personal fav is the original but its old and hard to get working) or give elite a try(that has its own issues however).","Jul 30, 2017 at 5:49 PM",3, 6,"Hello, thank you for your review.

lol guess after so many years and DLC and patches the game is still not playable without cheating xml. i read now in the forums that RMP s and fusion reactors and other wares are borked..... so after 6 hours of play you cant build stations anymore cause the hole universe has no fusion reacotrs or RMS anymore, mega llloooolll. i even went 3 hours looking for freighters wich carry them and nope..... reallly  LOL egesoft wtf is is wrong with you guys after 4-5 years and still unplayable","Aug 12, 2017 at 10:28 PM",2, 8,"Sorry but this is not quite right. The economy does have shortages in some areas by design. That is the nature of a simulated economy based on supply and demand. But on the large scale these resources are available elsewhere. It does make the game hard sometimes, agreed, but it also gives you much more benefit in transporting longer distances and explore the entire universe.

2022-05-28 14:29:03.734471,the9quad,Not bad,"Here is a mini review of what I have noticed so far:
The touch controls are good, they put some effort in there and it shows. 
The graphics are mixed with space areas looking pretty good, and things like ship interiors looking really low res. luckily you fly most of the time looking out the windows of your ship and not at the interior. Still though the interiors need work. NPCs are rough looking too. Graphics arent everything though.

Gameplay: I really cant comment too much on, as I am still doing tutorials so don't take the following as gospel.
One of the tutorials which happens to be where I am stuck is finding some lock box that is like finding a needle in haystack which is just infuriating causing me to just go play something else. You are given a scanner, and you turn it on, and it tells you to find a lockbox, that doesnt show up anwhere on your map.... it might be the most infuriating thing I have ever had to do in a tutorial ever. You also start off in a ship that flies super super slow. It has a boost that drains pretty fast, and takes forever to recharge. Not sure who thought that would be fun, but it isnt at all. Go find some random doodad in open space that could be anywhere and isnt marked on your map, and hey do it in this super slow ship......have fun! Oh well it is early access, and I am sure it will improve.","Aug 3, 2017 at 10:16 AM",3, 3,

2022-05-28 14:29:10.082734,jakerobbert,Early access,"I realy want to play this game in VR.
This is still very early access.

With that in mind I will use this review to give feedback to the devs since Oculus does not have that feature yet for early access games.

The controls are fairly intuitive for ship navigation.
Work needs to be done for on station navigation.  I get a good amount of motion sickness from moving around on the stations.
The tutorial/start game is a lot better than the actual game in that it starts by taking you through all of the features and controls in a logical and methodical way. 
This game is has a lot of depth, and the new tutorial helps with the learning curve a lot.
On the down side, the tutorial gets broken rather easily. (Asked to scan an object that doesn't unlock the next tutorial step : asked to take a mission, when the random mission selected asks me to deal with asteroids that are 750km in the tutorial zone that has no highways) It's greate that the tutorial is so meticulous now, but if anything does wrong, you need to start over.  (I recomend saving often incase something with it breaks)
I request that they prioritize making the map more easily usable.  It is very easy to get lost within a system.  In combat, or when moving around a system I often either can't locate my enemies because some data is covering the display, or I can't find a station the size of a house because it is somewhere behind me.
It works greate when the tutorial is spelling out exactly where to go, but I have no idea of how I will find my way around when the tutorial is over.
If a dev reads this; above all provide us some way of giving feedback.  I would love to spend the time to do a full playthrough of this game in VR when it is finished, right now however it's only good for a few minutes diversion until either the tutorial breaks, or I get lost on what to do next without the tutorial...

I suppose this is for the new generation that grew up with consoles. This is *really* annoying for anyone who grew up before the playstation (or just stuck with computers).

 
*Still*, the game appears to have a lot of potential (It really ought to score 4/5, but it's an early release, and we've seen what those often become, also I'm not a console player, tough).

The vistas and models are already fairly good although they certainly need more  greeble to give an effect of scale (which is a bit lost at the moment). 


Also the only documentation available is videos (which you can't browse, peruse, index, search in, go back to or use in any way unless you have ages to spend). I know that writing (not to mention reading, like, who has time to spend 10 minutes deciphering a couple words?) is a bit of a lost art, but maybe they could put an ad for a scribe?
Just for us old people who can still read?

Tl;Dr: The game has potential, it definitely needs fine tuning because the first thing it does is turn you off. However there's a fair chance that this will be corrected. So keep an eye on this title. (I'll edit as things evolve)","Jul 31, 2017 at 10:58 PM",3, 2,"Thanks for the review. To get the axis configured to your preference, try the following: Press escape to open the options-menu. Go to settings / controls.
