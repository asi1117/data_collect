2022-05-28 19:22:44.379700,VirtUalBaNdit,Sadly not worth it...,"Even if it´s only 5 buck, the devs don´t deserve it. The game looks ""decent"" but is very simplistic with the gameplay having a bare minimum as standard. Even with low expectations after reading some reviews i still managed to be disappointed. The controls freeze up constantly wich make 1 of 3 hands almost unplayable. You can only play 1 seat with no sidebets and the deck is continuously shuffling. No level of customization whatsoever... I really struggle to find 1 good reason for you to buy this instead of the free options already on the market.",Feb 16 at 8:41 AM,1, 2,
2022-05-28 19:22:44.394660,RC_IN_VR,Good Deal...No Pun,"This is very well done on the whole and is well worth the money for a five dollar game.  The casino looks great and I don't think any improvements need be made in the overall aesthetics.  I read a review where someone suggested having your own chips added to the gameplay and I agree that this would be a huge improvement, as having my pot shown on a digital display normally used for table limits confused me at first.  I also had the game freeze one time early on, but a restart put me back where I left off without losing my winnings.  It hasn't frozen once since.

A few notes to the developer:

--The option to turn off the music and or replace it with ambient “casino” sounds would be great.
--The game plays in the way that a continuous shuffle machine game does.  If a player had the option to select how many decks he is playing in a shoe and set a penetration, this would have a high appeal to “skilled” players.  Personally, I would pay much more than what the price is now for that option.
--Being able to increase the speed of the dealer would be nice touch
--Lastly, the dealer stands on a soft 17 and very few casinos do that these days.  Short of letting the player choose which rules the game will follow, this would be more accurate to have the dealer hit on a soft 17.

That said, if you enjoy blackjack, this game is a pleasure to play and I think it will be my go to for digital blackjack from now on.","Aug 17, 2019 at 4:31 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:22:44.409621,rondo777,Freezing!,"Just bought this.  Anxious to try it.  Agree with several other comments with regards to ambiance, etc. but what's most frustrating is it keeps freezing!  I can't select my bets, or betting options.  Have restarted by pc and Oculus software.  Exit the app and restart several times.  Game allows some clicks for selections but then freezes WAY TOO OFTEN.  Frustrating experience! I know it's only $4.99 but, it's $4.99!  Shouldn't be freezing.  I could tolerate the simple game play and experience but NOT the FREEZING!","Mar 4, 2019 at 8:03 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 19:22:44.424580,cigaremoods,,"Nice game.
At last we play without really losing money.
Only recap:
I can center the table at eye level, but i find that we are too close to the table and can not go back! You have to break your neck to look at the cards on the table.
If you could make the croupier a little more ""human"" it would be more alive.

2022-05-28 19:22:44.439540,Anomalous2141,Missing Oculus Touch,"In addition to the aforementioned bugs, it's classified as supporting Touch but it's actually supporting Touch as a gamepad.  You're not actually holding the cards in VR; it's a pretty big loss for a game like this to not be able to pick up your own cards.  I'd like to pick up my cards, toss the chips on the table as I bet, maybe even use some of the table gestures to hit and stand.  Also the movement feels very robotic and artificial.  I'd mark it down more in stars except it was only five bucks.  I also appreciate the assurance that there isn't and will never have buyable currency.  It's good for five bucks.","Jun 14, 2018 at 10:16 AM",4, 5,"Thanks Aaron for the feedback and the rating/review.  
All good suggestions. We tried to emulate a real casino which you aren't allowed to pick up the cards off the table (at least not in vegas casino table blackjack to my knowledge). The dealer handles the cards.  It's a good idea about the chips and table gestures. The movement needs a bit more pizazz, i do agree. I'll see what i can do about that. It's that little bit of polish that can really make a game shine. yeah, we wanted to make this not like the other games that keep charging for currency, and keep the price point so that the value is there for those that like a simple game of blackjack. They can practice and get their strategy down before heading to a real casino.  As for the bugs, were almost ready to push an update to fix the push issue. I'm so sorry that slipped by us."
2022-05-28 19:22:47.568172,tonyfromsyracuse,Simple VR fun,"You see some developers shooting for the stars and crashing with these big huge games that dissapoint,, meanwhile sometimes I prefer simple ole little VR things like this instead. nice music also. it could use a few more frills....maybe people walking around in the background and more casino background noise but for 4.99, its not an issue, the game serves its purpose. nice job.","Jun 13, 2018 at 5:42 AM",3, 3,"Thank you so much for taking the time to review it and offering your feedback. 
I completely agree, It could use a little more casino ambience and we'll see what we can do about getting it in there in a future update."
2022-05-28 19:22:47.583132,Shisou078,Good but buggy,"I like it, i woudl have given it more stars but, it takes your money when you push, stimes i shoudl win 100$ but i win 2300 or some other weird number.  

Once the bugs are worked out it' scertianly worth the 5$ I'm happy i got it (assuming they fix the bugs)","Jun 13, 2018 at 9:13 AM",3, 3,"Thank you for the review.
I apologize about the push bug.  I want you to know we will have a fix up very soon."
