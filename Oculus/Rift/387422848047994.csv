2022-05-28 16:19:25.610414,theSHHAS,Please Make An Oculus Quest Port!,"This is the relaxing experience I'm missing on my Quest! I'm the kind of guy who hates winter (and live in Sweden, great...) but I love the snow scene where you can sit at night next to the cozy tent and crackling fire. There's something beautiful about it as long as I don't have to endure the cold, wet and horrible mess and enjoy the view from the comfort of my couch at home instead. 
Please, please, PLEASE bring this to the Oculus Quest!","Mar 13, 2020 at 12:08 PM",5, 26,
2022-05-28 16:19:25.625374,hypermatrix,could be better,"I like this kind of experience, but as many people have stated, you can only teleport to 3 different places. Besides, every time you look to those teleport spots, it highlights in the landspace, breaking the immersion. Sad","Dec 30, 2019 at 1:11 AM",3, 15,
2022-05-28 16:19:25.642329,balistic22,Not pleased,While I appreciate the work the devs have done in creating this I feel that it falls short of the $9.99 price point range. This should of included more ineractions and not just a simple teleport. I will say the sound scapes were of great quality.,"Aug 11, 2019 at 11:35 PM",2, 8,
2022-05-28 16:19:25.659284,forgottenrebel,The best environments for relaxation.,"In my opinion this is the best app available in VR for relaxation and meditating. Much more realistic than the others I own. Only one draw back, although you can teleport to another location you remain static once there to sit or stand and look around. If you could just walk around a bit , like say 20sq feet or something it would be so cool. Also would like to have a way to get rid of the radio period. IOt disturbs the natural view. Hope they keep going with this as ill pay for more scenes!","Dec 30, 2018 at 7:24 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 16:19:28.775947,nightcat.mau,In My Defense I Was Left Unsupervised,"This game isn’t bad for what it is. A lot of reviewers appreciated a place to just sit and chill. Then there are people like me. I invented beach hockey using driftwood and stones. I played the bongos by dropping big fruit. I played more hockey in the wooded park using the moored boat as a goal. I swung lanterns like Thor’s hammer and sent them sailing into the water. But I also chilled and watched the moonlight on water. This game does need more to do if they want active or fidgety people to expend enough energy to enjoy it, we just need activity to help our brains wind down then we can sit still for a few minutes. If you love sitting still and relaxing you will adore it, if you need to fidget first invent your own games. I will not tell you whether or not you can burn the tent, you must make discoveries on your own. Overall I got some exercise and played for over forty minutes in my first session, so not bad at all.","Aug 8, 2018 at 9:06 AM",3, 40,
2022-05-28 16:19:28.790907,TeacherAuthor,Calm,Surprisingly calm and relaxing ... and being able to manipulate the surroundings is funny. The stones stay where you throw them and even scare away fish.,"Jul 26, 2018 at 2:09 PM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 16:19:28.804870,RScullion,Good at what it does,"I think this app is great at what it aims to do. It's a VR app for sitting (or lying) in a nice place and trying to relax. As such I think some of the criticisms about lack of movement and interactivity are a bit unfair. There's lots of attention to detail and nice touches - tent flapping in the wind, birds in the sky and butterflys around fires. 
It doesn't get 5 stars as it could definitley be better. The night scenes get quite boring - there are no clouds, or planes / contrails and I didn't recognise any of the constellations. Also, only the beach is really a nice place to be. The mountain and the arctic are both quite similar - mountainous, cold and snowy. There is more interest and variety in the scenes at the end of 'The Climb'. Maybe take a note from that and add an 'Alps' scene. The radio is a nice touch, but you should be able to set up your own playlists.
Also, as my wife pointed out, you should be able to draw in the sand on the beach.","Apr 29, 2018 at 5:36 PM",4, 15,
2022-05-28 16:19:28.819830,VirtuaLieven,"Okay, but could be better","(+) Graphics are wonderful, the app is perfect indeed to relax and enjoy the view. The app is easy to use (since it has no functions anyway)
(-) Having only 3 locations to teleport to in each environment is a shame, as there are many interesting things to look at, including place you can see but not access. Also, the menu shows 6 locations, but actually it's only 3 with day/night versions each.","Jan 12, 2018 at 8:43 PM",3, 12,
2022-05-28 16:19:28.833793,MarquisDeSang,"Not enough content, very relaxing.","I actually fell asleep in my chair listening to the wolves at night. It's so good, I bought it for my PSVR and now Oculus. I really need this experience, but I want more.","Dec 24, 2017 at 10:26 PM",3, 13,
2022-05-28 16:19:31.918543,Aden777,Ok graphics,I was hoping the graphics would be better since this is essentially a 'walking simulator'. It was ok though.,"Oct 20, 2017 at 9:18 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 16:19:31.935497,Clickingtoenails,Great environments for relaxation,Would be great to develop more though!,"Oct 30, 2017 at 8:21 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 16:19:31.952452,DOOdles7,Look elsewhere,"Dated, basic and overpriced. This needs to be upgraded or the price needs to be reduced by half. A few locations with a few static points and that's it. Disappointed.","Jan 13, 2018 at 12:44 AM",2, 10,
2022-05-28 16:19:31.969406,MassiveBlack,A few locations with no locomotion,"This is very much first generation VR. A few environments with a few different points to teleport around. No movement, limited interaction.
For half the price I'd give it an extra star maybe but there are MUCH better relaxing experiences for a similar price tag.","Nov 23, 2017 at 1:09 AM",2, 12,
2022-05-28 16:19:31.985364,SadGamerDad,Has potential but needs more features,"Watch my Youtube Channel let's play. This is the nature/relax VR game I found that let's me skip a stone however the fixed gazed based teleportation along with only three locations (each with day and night which is a bit of a cop out) brings it down a star. Give me custom music, let me freely move about and let me get into the objects like boats and do some fishing and just relax. Pros. Runs on UE engine and looks nice, Physics are good for dropping items into the water and for floating in the water.  Cons - Fixed locomotion, 3 locations (night version of the same location doesn't do it for me, sorry guys) Value (a bit pricey for what you get)","Jun 18, 2017 at 2:55 PM",3, 9,
2022-05-28 16:19:35.068118,DimSum-PorkBun,Nice environments.,"This is as good as the natural and artificial environments in some other VR titles or better. The sticks, rocks, radio and immersive sounds of surrounding ambience make this very calming.","Sep 16, 2017 at 10:09 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:19:35.085073,user045,Quality but not perfect,Really high quality graphics with some basic interaction. Gave it 5 stars for the graphics and environments. Took me a while to work out you need to look at a location where you can teleport too. Basic but something I will go back to again and again for the environments.,"Jun 27, 2017 at 5:17 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 16:19:35.101030,chrismarble85,Do Not Buy!,"There are only three environments that you can visit at night or day time. Each has about three places you can 'teleport' to- no walking/movement in between, which feels really limiting. You've seen everything it has to offer after about 4 minutes. As far as the interactive elements of the environments go, you can have fun throwing stones and snowballs, or change the pace by lighting a stick on fire. That's it! I just saved you $10.","Jan 24, 2017 at 1:17 PM",1, 33,
2022-05-28 16:19:35.116987,Fiddypercent,"Love it, Just what you need to relax",Its just a gameworld to chill in. Great for when you just need to get away for a bit. I normally sit down or lay down and just recharge great game,"Apr 18, 2017 at 5:30 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 16:19:35.131948,HanneH,Language settings,The description of the application indicated that the application would be available in Dutch. Does anyone know how to change the language settings?,"Mar 22, 2017 at 6:25 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 16:19:38.243625,Yeezplate,"Solid ""escapism"" app","If you are looking for an app to transport you from you current reality for a relaxing experience, this is a solid option. While I will agree with other reviewers who would like to see improved graphics, I don't think you should discount the importance of the entire experience, including sound. Immersion is exceptionally important in this app, and while I'm not suggesting you purchase them, the Oculus earbuds drastically improved my experience (I can no longer here my PC and fan in the background). I've been using this experimentally for meditation, and although it's difficult because of the headset (presence seems to make the pixels and headset more noticeable), I do find myself transported to another world occasionally. Additionally, I've been tinkering with using my suntherapy lamp through the nose-gap in hopes of staving off ""S.A.D."" I'm not a doctor, but I imagine after a long stressful day, or an afternoon stuck in traffic, being able to sit on the beach or in the mountains could be beneficial for just about anyone. Just measure your expectations, make yourself comfortable, practice your breathing and leave your VR firearms at ""Home."" :)","Jan 9, 2017 at 1:07 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 16:19:38.258585,vanfanel,Beautiful!,Beautiful scenery!  If you want a relaxation video this is probably the best there is.  Crank the graphic settings all the way up for all the extra details.  Turn the radio on and relax.  Found one little 'easter egg' already so I hope there's more.  The areas to teleport and explore are limited but this is more for relaxation and with that pleasant scenery and music I think it does a good job!,"Dec 16, 2016 at 1:20 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 16:19:38.272548,JamesWjRose,Wonderful,"I am currently attempting to make my own Northern Lights VR and when I found this I was sad as it is so much better than I could create.   A beautiful piece of work.

The Transport-To markers in the game NEED to change as they are a bright red beam that is so very much out of place.

I would also like to be able to put my own music on the radio.","Dec 18, 2016 at 3:50 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 16:19:38.287507,Blarby,Far from perfect!,Bad graphics. Three levels. No movement. There are MUCH BETTER apps for this. Refund?!!,"Apr 23, 2017 at 3:40 AM",1, 10,
2022-05-28 16:19:38.302467,anisotropic,Blurry and expensive,"This has so much potential, yet it feels very unfinished. Compared to ""The Blu"" it's very blurry and overall a less rich experience.

The sounds and vibrations from the items you can touch is very very annoying.

NOT worth the 10 dollars, tops 1-2 dollars.","Dec 31, 2016 at 1:03 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 16:19:41.401179,warpwhistler,Simple delight--worth the price!,"This game is simple, but the interactive touches (being able to pick up sticks and light them on fire, etc) are delightful, and the choices of locations are excellent. Worth the price just to show off how immersive VR can be!","Jan 11, 2017 at 8:34 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 16:19:41.416139,Ruined,"Wanted to like it, not immersive enough","First off, the touch controls here are barely utilized.  You basically point them for limited teleportation around a small area and pickup cosmetic items - there isn't much to do.  Next, the touch controllers show up as controllers in the game instead of hands.  If you are going to immerse someone in a peaceful vacation spot, it makes sense to see hands and not game controllers.  Last, while it is true the spots were quite peaceful, I did not find there was enough variation or freedom of movement; if I could teleport around a decent chunk of the island that would be different, but one is truly limited to small confines here in my opinion.  A good start, but needs to improve the immersion factor and sheer content to explore.","Dec 29, 2016 at 8:59 AM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 16:19:41.430102,Luna-NY,Not sure why the hype,"Not that much content to support the pricing.  I get where people say this is cool for brand new users, but IMO the original Oculus Dreamdeck provides way more and for free.  Pass on this one and show them Dreamdeck or Steams Destinations.","Dec 17, 2016 at 9:43 PM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 16:19:41.445062,Pulse4j,Peaceful and meditative,"This is a beautiful app, and is exactly what it advertises.  It has 3 scenes, with both night and day.  You can teleport to different regions as well as have some small interactions with the environment.  I had never seen the northern lights, and thought it was beautiful and realistic.  I love to just put on the word of God and listen while I admire the scenery.  If anyone has the intention of just taking a break from the world, this is a great way to do it!","Dec 23, 2016 at 4:22 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:19:41.460022,LiddaRogue,Very relaxing,"I have personally found all the scenic apps/games for oculus a most rewarding, so if you're into that you'll love this too.
Really love the destinations and the graphics are very nicely put together.
Not giving 5 stars for a couple of details; Needs hands, interaction with the very few materials you do get feels clunky at times and there should be more destinations for the price.
Hopefully there will be more in the future. :)","Dec 21, 2016 at 11:28 PM",4, 1,
