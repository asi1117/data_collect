2022-05-28 16:13:12.996501,TheLonelyDeveloper,Wanna waste your time? Play this!,"Complete waste of time. Not even a demo. When you think the fun is about to start, it ends. Graphics are extremely poor, you shoot a bunch of bottles and that's the most ""fun"" you will have with this. You swing ONCE like spiderman, see a monster, shoot a few spider webs to ""catch a falling crane""... no comments... and thne it ends. Too short, poorly developed ( I say this as a game developer myself ) and a complete waste of your time. Not even Spiderman fan kids would like this. If I were a little kid that likes Spiderman I would literally cry after this ""experience"". BOOOO!",22 days ago,1, 6,

2022-05-28 16:13:13.046367,JuMeme,"Ad, for a non vr game?","I have to compliment on the graphics of this game, spiderman is REALLY detailed, and the view, i gasped because of how pretty it is. But now, let's talk about the gameplay. This ""experience"" is just a tutorial IN VR for a NON VR ps4 game, and not even a good one at that, the swinging is semi-good but its all programmed and you can't roam the city freely. I'm a bit bummed out, because a game like this could turn out really cool, but i understand that the developers couldn't do more than this beacuse of Sony limiting them. 2 stars because it's really, REALLY well done but i don't understand why make an ad for a non vr platform in vr.",Jan 6 at 1:09 AM,2, 287,

2022-05-28 16:13:16.209906,pashcan,Just a web shooter tutorial,This was extremely underwhelming.

The game was fun but seriously the game only lasted me 9 minutes was this supposed to be an ad to go buy the dvd discs? I mean come one i installed this spiderman instead of far from home because this game was older and probobly better then the other one since its new and was working on some features. come one it wasnt fun at all i couldnt even swing or use my blasters freely.,Jan 14 at 1:27 PM,2, 0,

2022-05-28 16:13:25.712490,blako,Literally just an ad.,"After playing Far From Home VR by the same developers, I had some good expectations on this, considering that Far From Home VR was a decent experience, though the campaign was short. What I got from this game is a 5 minute ad. The only thing you really do is target practice and then you swing literally just once. This includes the fact you cant control where you swing it just swings for you. This is just an ad for Homecoming and it's dissappointing. The graphics were amazing, they just never added gameplay",Mar 26 at 12:43 PM,1, 0,

Loved the sky and looking over building as I leaned over. Sound could have been better taking you more into the experience as not much going on. The swinging experience (not in this) but the future game could cause motion sickness so I hope they can find a solution to this or offer comfort options. The game is a good taster for the scope of just what is possible with VR (heights, size and scale of city, swinging, feeling immersed and being a superhero) These adverts are great because they are free but give you a taster in my opinion.

Instead, I was given a 5mins demo of what could've been a lot nicer.

So far, pretty much everything that Sony Pictures Virtual Reality has put out as been put down, I understand why you guys went with the free route this time around but I must say, for such a powerful brand, that didn't feel like much of an effort. WB got some serious advance when it comes to VR, you guys need to play catch up and these only increase the gap.
