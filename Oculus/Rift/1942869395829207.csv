2022-05-28 19:09:06.887200,CosySister,Can't wait for Episode 2,"I got pretty invested in the characters and the storyline, though first some critique of the gameplay.

There were a few gamebreaking glitches that made me unable to progress forward to the next task/puzzle at the area after the prologue, after restarting the whole game it worked however (basically I managed to dodge a threat that you weren't supposed to escape from since it triggers a flashback that hints to where you'll find an useful item). Walking by teleporting seems a little odd too at times, I noticed that I had to switch the hand I was using to walk with from time to time because sometimes the other hand wouldn't show were I could move (hope that makes sense). Would also be nice if the people you met in the game had eye contact with you while they spoke to you, most seem to stare off in the distance or look over your shoulder. Something to keep track of your current objective would also be nice (because honeslty I got sidetracked a lot and forgot what I was supposed to do haha, stopped to admire the night sky too often). 

Now that I got that out of the way, this game is pretty good, a lot of the environments look really beautiful. How you solve puzzles is really clever in my opinion. I loved the atmosphere, it makes you feel uneasy and on edge. The soundtrack is wonderful too (there something so beatiful but also terrifying about the main theme) and the storytelling had me incredibly invested. You want to know more as you play the game since it has a huge mystery element to it. Every step gets you closer to the truth while also raising more questions and the suspense just keeps on buildning.. So I really hope episode 2 is still in development! I need to know what happens next!","Jan 3, 2021 at 8:04 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:09:06.902160,Lalle75,"A good start, but...","...it suddenly ends. But let's start at the beginning.

At some points the puzzles were very bad. You have to be in a certain location/position in time, but sometimes it doesn't work. I restarted several times, getting killed and suddenly it worked.

Then you keep searching for items you need. You know that you need a cutter and search at a location where you may find it. But nothing there. And suddenly, there it is.

And then, when the story is getting on and you start doing interesting things (controlling a reactor), the game ends right after a cutscene.

I hope, the next episode will not feel like it's unfinished.","Jul 11, 2020 at 5:13 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 19:09:06.916123,danwarb,"Good setting, story and puzzles.","Characters don't look at you like they do in the same scene from the Prologue demo. Instead they stare in random directions. I think this is why some reviews complain about the animation.

Ends on an introduction to an episode 2, that doesn't exist?","Apr 30, 2020 at 9:09 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:09:10.033784,rh_galaxy,A very good game,"I like the 1960-feel of the game, and all worked well except for the ending where you are supposed to calibrate the particles... I aim with the ""gun"" and fire a beam, but nothing is happening after 2 minutes and I quit the game to try later. Next time I find out that the game has not been saved after the three successful steps of starting the reactor, I would have to redo them - I gave up there. Good game but the ending lacks.","Mar 5, 2020 at 10:25 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:09:10.048744,dave.parry.1953,Can't run it,"I'm trying to play using OculusLink - but can't get past the initial part. Once I've acknowledged the settings (on the platform), it seems that I have to press a button to my right and behind me. I can't press it. Tried a few times and I'm always  stuck on the platform. No guide, no help on the website. Disappointed that this game just won't run for me - all my other games work fine with OculusLink.

Update: March 5th. Still no good. Can't get rid of the menu button prompt (that shows the controller and buttons). Can close and open the game menu fine but can't do any more than that. I'n guessing this is one of the games that doesn't work too well with OculusLink.","Mar 6, 2020 at 4:59 AM",2, 1,"Hi, Here are a few tips for you to start. 
1. Close the menu to start moving pressing the menu button on your left stick.
2. Move with your joystick towards the button
3. Point your index finger to press the button.

2022-05-28 19:09:10.078664,Siegfriedshead,It's a decent puzzle adventure title.,"It was pretty good. A little scarrier than I'd like though.
I hope the next few chapters are a little less stressfull about being scary and puzzles that involve doing things before running out of time. A little more chilled for the next few chapters and getting back to this intense at the end is how I hope this goes anyways.","Nov 11, 2019 at 5:00 AM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 19:09:13.212284,Comrade_Ivan,NOT a complete game,"I really wanted to like this game. I loved Red Matter, and this game is rather reminiscent of it. But it left me with a feeling of an overly ambitious project that ran out of money and subsequently got released incomplete. Great potential; amazing eerie ambiances; intrigue that beckons at me to continue playing, but it turned out to be a frustrating waste of time. 
My gripes:
1. This is NOT a complete game. It ends with a to-be-continued-in-next-game type of a message.
2. Wanna do a quick 180° turn? Forget about doing a series of snap turns - turn once, wait a sec, then you can do another. What's up with no multiple snap turns?
3. Objects readily fall through items they’re placed on. Early on, I dropped a clue and it fell into a wall where I couldn’t pick it up. A bit later, I used a stick to flip a note that was left for me to read. It got pushed into the ground and I never saw the note again.
4. Game keeps getting stuck. Figure out a puzzle, do everything right - no cigar. Restart the game, do it exactly the same, all good. Go fig!
5. There are 2 ways of picking up objects – you can grab them, or you can laser-point at them and hit the grab button. The latter method doesn’t work. That is to say, you need to aim to miss the object and hit some arbitrary spot beside it before the grab button will work. This is further exacerbated by distance.
6. Smooth locomotion follows the orientation of the hand, not the head, and it slows to a crawl when strafing. It also starts flipping out if your hand isn't level and there is no option to change the movement mode. Holding a flashlight in the locomotion hand will either leave you sick, or bumping into stuff you can't see.

I initially gave the game 1 star due to getting stuck. But then I upgraded to 2 stars after hearing back from the devs, and decided to give it a full go (hoping to upgrade my review further). But after playing it through and learning this is just an opening to a future game, back to 1 star we go","Aug 10, 2019 at 1:35 PM",1, 10,"Hi, Thanks for playing. We would like to investigate this issue if it caused by the game. Could you please send us an e-mail proze@signsine.com and give us a bit more details of when did this occur. We will be happy to help."
2022-05-28 19:09:13.227243,mishka11,Glitch - UPDATE,"Updated review:
Many thanks to the devs for correcting the issue. I was able to make it into the underground facility and got as far as achieving the arm device. So I feel like im making progress &.I added a star.  I wish there wasnt so much darkness though.  Using the flashlight is an option ...but its only a tiny area of light. And it leaves only one hand available at times when you need two hands. Btw... i appreciate these devs for not using the dark as an excuse to jump-scare!

FYI devs - strange event. Two times the underground bunker (after the cave-in) got flooded and i died...falling into an endless pit of depth. The game would not end itself so I had to log out and restart. After restart, the flooding would be gone and I was able to move forward. Not sure if thats normal or not.

I still believe this game has a 5star potential and will update once finished.

old review:
When I get to the underground bunker...the hands turn into fists and unable to use bolt cutters...hands are unusable from that point forward. I restarted game and had same problem when approaching the same door. Its too bad because the game is pretty good. But some issues and improvemet suggestions:
1) There needs to be a hint option...wandering around in the dark is not fun. 
2) Because if you dont do certain things in order, you wont get the next to-do hint or cut scene. (I did the fox tail before going into 1st bunker so the walkthru scene didnt trigger wihtout a restart)
3) Interactive areas dont light up. So good luck figuring out where to use the bolt cutters. I spent forever trying to find a spot on the barbed wire. I gave up and went to the bunker door and keep getting glitched there
 4) There are many character jumps and Id like to stay on top of the story...so some kind of story summary would be nice. maybe in the settings menu? 

This game has a lot of potential. But Im stuck atm :(","Aug 4, 2019 at 2:21 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 19:09:13.243200,Mach13-13,Loved it!,"I love this type of game.  Its getting its 5stars for the price point V content.  GFX were very good but for the characters.. they feel a little outdated for a quality game and dont seem to match the rest of the game quality wise.

 If you like Red Matter you'll like this one.  The puzzlles were a tad more challenging I thought, but well worth the time it took to figure them out.  They do get increasingly so the further in you go.  I rarely like the endings of any great game... mainly becasue that means its over... kinda anticlimatic.    FYI.. Best game ending todate has been that of Obduction.

It ran with all settings maxed out (without much of an issue) on my Intel i7 4790.
 1070Ti rig.

Question is would I buy the next episode? Well for the challenging gameplay alone I'd say yes.","Jul 3, 2019 at 3:45 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:09:13.258160,DRDD333,A Second Look,"With a little complaining, and several timely patches and updates, this has proven an interesting experience, one that deserves a second look, as well as a second change. I don't have much time to play the game, but when I do I have found that I am enjoying it more as time goes on. I recommend giving it a chance.","Jul 8, 2019 at 9:43 PM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 19:09:13.274118,Jake_Veeper,,"I loved the game and it worked perfectly until I got to the point where I had to adjust the alpha particles on panel C9. I shoot at the rectangle that opens up by the reactor but nothing happens. I get a beam but it doesn't do anything. I'm using a Rift S. Unless I'm doing something wrong the game is stuck at that point. I loved it till that point. The graphics are great and the attention to detail is fantastic. As a ham radio operator I enjoyed the Foxhunt part. OK, I was doing something wrong but not going to spoil anyone's game by spilling the beans... I restarted the game anyway so will be playing from the beginning... Enjoy...It's a great game.. Finished it and I enjoyed playing it a second time. Great game. They did a good job and I hope there is more to come.","Jun 29, 2019 at 10:49 PM",5, 6,

Very good graphics, environments, sounds effects and music. There are 'flashbacks' interwoven in the story that fill in details about the what happened in the past and they are done in a unique and clever way. There are some creepy parts that are enhanced by the spatial audio and dark environment during some parts in the forest. I'm not done yet, about 2.5 hours in so far and can't wait to experience what waits for me at Enlightenment.","May 1, 2019 at 6:49 AM",5, 9,

I've just completed it & I can honestly say I absolulely loved it from start to finish. It's a bit similar to Red Matter (but better in my opinion), so if You enjoyed that, You'll be sure to love this game. I highly recommend it. I cannot wait for the next installment.

A good story game with amazing graphics and sound. Great atmosphere with an intriguing and promising story. There are excellent, very fun and non-repeating puzzles during the whole game. This game was made with love and a soul was put into it, this is visible throughout all game. Its one of the best games in my library.

2022-05-28 19:09:19.541355,avenger123,Great storytelling game!,"Great storytelling game with appealing graphics! 
The theme is close to Twin peaks or Stranger Things
due to the similar atmosphere, but in a different style.
It is great that PROZE has a lot of interactions, 
which reveals VR potential really well.
The ending has a twist on its own,
too.
I finished the game overall in 5 hours, 
perhaps I was a bit slow solving puzzles 
and tried to find all the notes about Patient-1.
I think that the price is fair for this experience.
I can definitely recommend the game.","May 7, 2019 at 8:18 PM",5, 5,
