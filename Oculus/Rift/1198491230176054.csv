But then they made a Dead & Burried 2. And I was like ""O, M, G,"" because I didn't fine out until the 2 month anniversary. I would rate this a 4.5 because nobody playes Dead & Burried 1 any more and I don't want to buy the secend one.",13 days ago,5, 1,

I would play this game for hours. It was fun teaming up, or playing against other players & talking smack (lol). Dead & Buried II was not as good In My opinion. I wish they would reintroduce this game with the Oculus Quest so more people would be online playing this awesome game.",Feb 4 at 10:51 PM,5, 9,

GAme is dead now and as nobody playing i wasted a big lump of cash here.  Please put it on steam....MULTIPLAYER DEAD do not buy as the solo parts are VERY boring and not worth more than £5 and a casual gameplay liek every few months for 10 minutes.

2022-05-28 11:26:30.618453,rchrdcrg,Meh.,"Maybe this was great when it came out, but VR has come so far, and this game has not changed at all. My two biggest issues are the forced tutorial segments where Ghostly McOldman has to explain everything to me like I'm a baby with no way to skip it, making any kind of exploration of menus and game options TEDIOUS! Second, there is no way to adjust the angle of the gun, and by default they aim way too high... I have to hold my wrist at an odd angle in order to line up the sights of the gun and hit anything. These two issues are more a product of this game's age, but they could be easily patched. It sadly turns what is probably a fun game into something that I just can't play for more than five minutes before I want to uninstall it agian.","Jul 5, 2019 at 10:09 PM",3, 6,

Not sure why they decided to make a second one instead of just adding more content and improving here. Must be a fashion grab thing. This is still way better than the 2nd edition and way less buggy.

I'm a late night gamer, and if i hop on around 11-2am EST, I'm shocked if I can find just ONE player to join me in horde mode after say five minutes of searching.

I enjoy the game most in a squad of four gunslingers firing away at zombies; it's just a shame that it's so difficult to find someone to join you in this game.","Apr 28, 2019 at 3:55 AM",4, 16,

I would enjoy it a whole lot more if you could actually move around, but you are stuck in the same place. You have to hide behind pillars and barriers to avoid being shot. This gets old fast, and it really ruins the gameplay. If you want a good shooter, go play Contractors.","Jun 11, 2019 at 3:48 AM",1, 1,

- gunrange: extremly boring
- salon shooting 1 vs 1: extreme unfair. The spawning person is always at a disatvantage bc the other sees you first before you even see something. 
- Menus are extremly annoying
- no option to leave the gunrange before the timer ends
- leaving in PVP is horrendous: before exiting you have to confirm and if you get killed before... well sucks for you, click leave again

This game came free with touch controllers.
Never have i ever been able to play it online. Not once. I can either shoot rocks in lobby or go to practice range. 

If I'm bored waiting for a game  and go to Global Search and check all available game types, it seems for a second it found me a game because screen goes black, but after a while in darkness I'm thrown back into lobby. No message, no error, no nothing.

Seriously guys, some feedback would be much appreciated. 
Like some indicator if my port is open, list of games being played now, or awaiting someone, connection time in ms to games.
I have no idea what is wrong and how to fix it, cause you give me nothing to work with. It just doesn't work.

One thing you should keep in mind, is that, the game encourages having a large play space area. I have around 1-1/5 square meters of space and I have hit tables and walls multiple times. I would definitely recommend at least 2 square meters to properly play this game, as it requires you to take cover frequently.

Skill is required to aim, and reflexes to dodge and shoot. You seriously have to practice. I would hate to see my death count. I've met some great people in game that have helped out the new players.

2022-05-28 11:27:33.709324,LuridFTW,"Good idea, Badly designed.","One of the worst games I've played in VR so far, no wonder it was free. 


Basically, the game is all about who can spawn kill the quickest. The maps are broken into 5 different scenes, where you'll be attacking or defending, if you're defending the goal is to spawn kill the enemies 3-5 times each. If you do this then you've defended. If you're attacking the impossible objective is to spawn and instantly try to not die by the defenders spawn killing.

The player positions are fixed, so you will not be able to move around other than walking within your play area to move slightly. The fixed positions are designed very badly with very little cover from some angles and literally none on other angles. Some positions have a much greater advantage, with enough cover to actually hide or a nice weapon. You'll find that in many positions, hiding isn't an option at all, so again its about who can spawn kill the other player the quickest.

If they'd change the positions and allow us to actually have cover and defense against spawn killing then it would actually be a fun game to be honest.","Jan 30, 2018 at 9:03 PM",1, 3,

There are two six shooters on your hips that you draw and have to hold the whole time. This can get tiring if you stay alive many many levels. The reload is a quick side to side motion. I play this standing up since on of the feature is being able to duck behind boards and crates. Some of the zombies shoot arrows at you and one of the bosses throws flaming bottles your way. You have to duck from the arrows and shoot the bottles before they reach you or you'll catch on fire. After 3 lives you die, unless you have earned more on the level.

But the reason why I did not make this 5 stars is because the co-op feature is way too unfair. I joined in a match where me and this guy fought another person by himself, and he won suprisingly without a single death. The other guy I think left the match so it was me and the other guy 1v1ing.

This is no longer a suggestion, please, Gunfire, you need a system where we can kick AFK people in Quickdraw.

You are supposed to have a few seconds after you spawn before you can be killed but its obvious that there are some players who have learned how to apply some kind of exploit. These same players are also able to kill you while you are completely concealed and have way faster reload times. If they cleaned up this game and eliminated exploits then it would certainly get 5 stars.,"Dec 29, 2017 at 5:10 PM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 11:27:49.500218,Ndi,Right.,"a) It should tell you it was never designed for single player. In horde mode, 4 monsters pop up and swipe at me and it takes several shots to down ONE.
b) The holster thing is spotty at best. I know you want me to feel all-western but I'm in a chair and the guns are under the table, so I can't draw comfortably. Quickdraw doesn't work.
c) UI is weird. Guns draw a laser so you can point, but don't fire until the hidden timer expires on the curscene. No explanation on why guns just don't work. Feedback when they are unloaded is spotty. No alternative to reload revolvers other than the silly gesture that, if you can't perform for any reason, you can't play.

One would expect a few basic things in order before playing. Basic balance, minimal adjustments for people not playing 4 at a time, standing up, online, an option for people with bad wrists.

There isn't that much left, basically. Grabbing guns is not innovative (though having to hold tight for the duration kinda is, in a bad way). Reloading is cool but badly implemented.

I don't see how this is something you should get above any other game. Then again, it's free with Touch, so, I guess you get what you pay for.

Going to other shooters after playing this, my accuracy and speed are way up. CONS - The way I hold the controller and the angle the ingame gun is off (shooting ~5 degrees too high); this will vary between player preference. The game needs a setting where you can change the angle of the gun vs the controller, so that it feels right.","Oct 21, 2017 at 7:02 AM",4, 0,

As soon as I jumped in to my first multi-player game, I realised this was so much more than a cartoony arcade shooter. Standing next to another player and being able to chat, fist bump and even fling playing cards at the other team before the round even began, had me grinning from ear to ear. 
Once the game got underway, I was seriously impressed with how immersive it quickly became. The duck and cover mechanics are fantastic as it literally converts your room into a scene from the wild west – it has you crawling, ducking, leaning and peaking around corners whilst being able to chat, taunt or just dance around with your fellow players.

The only thing (and this is by no means a negative) you’ll need a decent sized play space to fully enjoy all the game has to offer. It’ll no doubt have you sweating after your first game.

Can we have some AI opponents please in the quickdraw game?
My grandchildren like the target shooting in this game because nothing shoots back! But they have difficulty with the reload move.

Soooo... because people lost every once in a while in 2 PVP levels it was determined that the only weapon that actually requires effort to learn was ""unfair"" and it needed fixing?

What about the real glitches like invisible walls that block shots or ghost heads that kill you when they are destroyed far away or the ability to kill bosses while invisible? 

There is a lot more to fix when it comes to real glitches. 

There is no reward for becoming experienced in this game. No advantages to leveling up except for character skins that have no effect on the actual performance of the character. No upgraded weapons.

Immersion, well, this is really something - it feels like the other players and standing here right beside me!

Gameplay wise, as the game tracks your movement I see a lot of potential for gameplay meta in position your body and time your shots/reloads. The variety of gameplay modes is awesome with 1v1, team PvP and team PvE.

It starts by giving you some instruction on how to shoot, and what the game is about and then lets you decide what mode of the 3 (not counting the practice range) you want to play. All 3 of these mods are very fun, my favorite right now being the Horde mode (sorry if this is not the correct name for it). 

My only gripe about this game is how the reloads are handled. I can flick my wrist to reload the revolvers the same way 5 times but only 3 of the 5 times the gun will actually reload. I have died many times simply because the gun wouldn't reload.

For the people complaining that there arent enough players, that IS NOT this games fault, VR is still a very new platform and not many people have access to this amazing technology. I'm sure over the next few weeks more people will begin playing because of this huge Oculus sale.

Just wish they have more hoard levels (arenas), hopefully another big update will give us that.  The shooting mechanics in this game is what keeps me coming back, its simple and satisfying.  Flick your wrist to reload is just so well done makes me feel like im a bada$$ gun fighter in the old west.  Shooting in the game is pretty challenging when you first play but once you get the hang of it its not hard to do even one shot kills in the head.  Be Warned: once you get hooked on shooting in this game your arms will get tired :)  I found resting my hands on a table  or knees and just rotating my hands gives me super steady shooting and less tired arms.  Overall I had a blast with this game and like most Oculus developed games truely a great experience.

One minor thing I have to say tho is the menu system in this game needs a little more work in terms of design.  Sometimes picking things in the menu im not sure if i am suppose to shoot to select or use my hands to select.  If u just make it more consistent like all shooting to select that'd be great.","Jun 23, 2017 at 12:49 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 11:29:33.979876,Elpoc,Exhilarating & best use of Touch so far,"Dead & Buried seems simple at first glance; a static shooter. But actually it's nothing like that. Firstly, it requires more player movement than anything else I've played in VR - it's definitely the most physically energetic game I've played yet - and secondly, the maps and gameplay are brilliantly balanced to make it continually varied and engaging. 
My playspace is about 2 metres across, and I use every inch of it playing this game. You might be crouching down behind a bunch of crates and peeking over to get some shots off, or dashing from one bit of cover at one end of your play space to another at the other end. The sense of presence in the gameworld is just amazing.
The gameplay is balanced via clever positioning of players - you move to another spot on the map when you get killed - and use of special weapons such as grenade launchers, three-shot rapid fire guns, bow and arrow or sniper rifle. This means that if someone has been spawned in a position with good cover, or at a long-range position with a rifle, you'll have various methods of dealing with them. It balances things out very well.
Horde mode is great fun too - the Witch boss feels like a World of Warcraft boss, and the developers have used some awesome visual and audio effects to enhance the experience.
Overall this is my single favourite title on Rift right now. Everything about it is polished, and the whole thing is just pure, if occasionally challenging, fun.","Mar 18, 2017 at 7:43 PM",5, 2,

The solo horde mode in this was poorly balanced with crappy animations that make you unsure whether you have fully killed an enemy or just stunned them, which leads to confusion and being overwhelmed by enemies you thought you had killed. The 6 shot guns make it really frustrating as you often run out of ammo while being mobbed and can't reload in time before you are downed completely.

The 2 vs 2 Shootout and Robbery modes lead to a lot of great, competitive rounds, but the gamble of waiting around in hopeless lobbies can be frustrating.

Horde mode is also extremely fun co-operative play that is the best way to get used to the game without getting destroyed by more experienced players in shootouts.

But given the smallness of the ecosystem, I wanted more effort (diversity and pizzazz) in the 1-player mode.  Space Pirate Trainer shows that gameplay depth is possible even with a simple shooter.  E.g. there could be more surprises and discoverability in the shooting range.  Or maybe something where the shooting gallery can attack the player so that the ducking mechanic somes into play.  Or more environments.  The game has lots of possibilities!  Just not executed (yet?).

The game makes you feel like a real cowboy, and the players in the muliplayer environments are really helpful and friendly to you when you're learning how to play, often giving instructions on how to play each game mode when you first enter.
What would make it even better is if the developers added a ""tutorial"" for each multiplayer mode, so that you understand what's happening when you enter the arena. There are tutorials and practice rounds for the single player areas, so perhaps more are on there way?

2022-05-28 11:30:31.226759,fallenangel82,Pure Awesomness,For a free game that came with Oculus Touch it's by far one of the best titles I've played. I keep coming back to it almost every time a play oculus. It's also a really fun game to demo to friends and family. I'm really hoping that they expand on the game and add more levels for horde and throughout. I've maxed out both my characters so far. Even though some have requested to play horde with just one player I can tell you it's just not as fun. I've been in a few games where I've been the only player from level 1 on and it's just not as much fun when you can't share in the excitment.,"Dec 26, 2016 at 6:54 AM",5, 0,

There's a lot of action in this one. VOIP throughout the multiplayer session makes it extra fun.
Two drawbacks at the moment: It can sometimes take a while to find a multiplayer game and due to my setup (one sensor is at the very end of my desk) the controllers sometimes lose tracking when I duck down on the floor (yes, you need to do that!!!)","Dec 26, 2016 at 5:54 AM",4, 0,

After a short amount of time I can say it's very good fun; although if you struggle to move, dodge and duck immediately, you're gonna die, a lot. I died a lot (my back and knees aren't too good what with years of heavy/building work) because I couldn't find adequate cover quick enough, but I still had fun and managed to score a few kills.

first of, it needs some singleplayer mode. because let's be honest here, multiplayer in VR is bound to fail as more and more games will get released.
unless the game is really really good the playerbase will drop.
SP is also needed just for having some solofun, to just relax a bit.

2nd, it needs to be more playerfriendly. For example, when i choose a mode and go for quickplay, it will go for a round of that mode but after that it just goes random.
3rd, it needs more content. as in more guns, skins, ...
