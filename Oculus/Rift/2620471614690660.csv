2022-05-28 19:44:50.936079,Satconcook,Please add settings,"I really like the 3D 360 videos of the center and the discussion to go with it. But, I can't stand that floating blue dot during the entire expereince and the floating subtitles. I feel it destroys the expereince and somewhat gives me a headache since they float in front of everything. Please remove the dot during videos and make it only appear when you look down. Add Touch support so we can use our hands to select the scenes and hopefully change settings that you add. I hate to give such a low review for the potential this has, but it really is hard to finish.","Aug 9, 2019 at 10:45 AM",2, 8,

There's a bit of mismatch between the left and right eye in some places leading to needing to close one eye.  At the same time at places the text is okay and at others the text is not properly aligned and affects your eyes.

Great first effort.  Not a fan of the whole mormon promotion thing.","Aug 8, 2019 at 9:08 AM",3, 1,
