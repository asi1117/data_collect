2022-05-28 16:52:06.711684,Lalle75,"Nice pong, but I have to refund anyway.","I played it for just a few minutes, and I was going to like it. But unfortunately the player REALLY needs enough space. My 3.5 x 3.5 m² are not enough to play.
So if have a gaming hall, you may buy it.","Sep 14, 2020 at 3:33 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 16:52:06.741603,JackDiddley,Really Fun...Once You Get The Hang Of It,"Breakout in 3D, really frustrating for the first few games.  Once you get the hang of it tho it is pretty addictive.  I feel like it could use a little more room, maybe just in the early levels.  Simple, fun, action packed, I like this one a lot.","Sep 22, 2019 at 9:39 PM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 16:52:06.755567,SET-VR,Yeee HA! This game rocks!,"I try to play this at least once a day. It is so good and so fast paced that I like the challenge it offers. This game is a pleasure to play, and it really is helping me to move my arthritic joints and to sharpen my hand-eye co-ordination. To put it bluntly, Duo is my favorite game! It is very well put together, things work just like they are supposed to and there seem to be no glitches at all. I just love it!","May 28, 2019 at 8:28 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:52:06.769529,VibrationsOfDoom,Fun! And pretty self explanatory,"Breakout+Arkanoid in virtual reality! Except YOU are holding the shields... Lots of really colorful bricks and patterns, though at first it took me a few levels to get the hang of what I was doing! Very frenetic action, this one will give you a little cardio workout for as long as you decide to play. Me being only 5'2, I was worried that I'd have to jump up to hit the balls, but it scales to my play room size perfectly! Even when I'm ""up against the wall,"" I find that I can still deflect the balls back. Challenge: To try and hit the yellow or blue ball with the correctly colored shield! Thankfully, it doesn't matter WHAT color shield you hit either colored ball with; something I was worried about at first but now that I'm a little better at the game, I;m trying to ONLY use the right colored shield with the right colored ball! A challenging little game, and it seems like there are a TON of levels Fun stuff!","Mar 22, 2019 at 9:11 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 16:52:09.880209,IndigoTea,"Mediocre - kind of fun, but...","The lack of walkthrough/tutorial introduction to explain the rules is really detrimental; the purpose of gold/blue balls and shields, how that impacts the game, what the differently marked cubes mean...not very intuitive.","Dec 18, 2018 at 11:58 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 16:52:09.895169,paulweaver464,DUO,Fun game and first few mins of game play im hating how big the shields are feels wrong. A update so you can adjust the size of the shields yourself  would be great Or just make them half the size,"Dec 12, 2017 at 11:40 PM",3, 4,Did you try hard mode? In hard mode shields are smaller.
2022-05-28 16:52:09.910129,CorySpaceCowboy,Meh,"Feel like I wasted my money on this one.. worth a dollar maybe, seriously. Could be that its just WAY too fast paced for me personaly. I think it could be better if it started out at a slower pace and gradually increaded in difficulty, maybe it does, but the game seemed unffairly difficult to me from the start, giving me no desire to ever to return to this impossibly difficult game. (Maybe I just suck though?)","Dec 12, 2017 at 6:20 PM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 16:52:09.924091,MrEntropy5,Breakout,Breakout/Arkanoid in first person. It gets hectic to the point where you're not sure you lost a ball at. I've hit walls and ceiling fans while playing this so I give it a thumbs up.,"Jan 8, 2017 at 2:22 AM",4, 14,
2022-05-28 16:52:09.938055,GametechUK,Pretty Good,"Not a bad little game, not much going on in terms of VR but a great game to let friends play as thier first VR experience. Search 'GametechUK' on Youtube, i have done a quick look style review so you can see what your buying.","Jan 4, 2017 at 5:25 PM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 16:52:13.029785,RapidX,,"This is a super fun game, like a retro arcade game except you're inside the game world.","Jan 3, 2017 at 3:59 AM",5, 6,
