I personally think that with the lack of 3D content this would be better suited for a monitor, as sitting in one place reading a wall of text with a headset straped to your face can get tiring.","Dec 9, 2017 at 4:57 PM",3, 12,
2022-05-28 18:09:03.662510,Z-ice,A Novel whit powerful Love story,"As it says in the description, its a novel that u read, whit very emotional music and changing skybox around u to get the right atmosphere, this game only contain more or less 2 scenes that got animations and a real 3D Mesh, for being a Novel i will rate it to 5 Stars, but i only give 3 stars for Animaton and Modeling, but animations looks hand made and not Human captured animation so it looks a bit squary moving and stoned face expresions, and allso the Poly count on the avatar could be more than double and still be running fine on 970, but the people that made it have used really good voice actors and well written story line. so it put me a in to tears. This is a Novel not a Animated Movie, so keep that in mind.  so because of the wonderful music, good story line, good price and good Voice actors, i give it a 4 Stars. :)","Dec 12, 2017 at 4:45 AM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 18:09:03.683455,Fredrix,A reading novel with a beautiful story,"While the backgrounds and music were beautiful, I was really hoping for more 3D animations and voices when I bought this novel. However, the story was really touching and made me ignore the fact that I had to read from a big wall of text. Therefore I would really like to give this novel 5 stars, but it is hard when you are forced to read the story as a somewhat little more immersive book. But I will definitely buy the next one aswell, just to be able to enjoy its story and music!","Dec 8, 2017 at 2:02 AM",4, 3,"Thank you for your review!

A modern fairytale.","Nov 30, 2017 at 7:18 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:09:03.713375,NV,Not Bad,"Couldnt give it 5 stars, since its mostly reading a word bubble on a screen. 
Voiceovers for the word bubble seem semi random.
The 3d scenes were great. If the whole story was 3d/vr, would def be 5 stars.","Dec 8, 2017 at 1:19 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 18:09:06.822060,BuckleyB,Fails at being a visual novel,"It fails at being a visual novel when 90% of the time you're staring at a word bubble, very little of visual interest happens here. The story is somewhat interesting and sweet but this has no business being in VR and isn't worth the asking price.","Dec 1, 2017 at 7:31 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 18:09:06.837020,bababaip,Like it.,"I like this VRnovel. This story is short, but it shook my heart. I was moved to tears. I think that the production of sentences, music, and characters was combined with exquisite. ""Fulldive Novel"" is one of the growing cultures, but I look forward to it maturing. Thanks to the new device, I was able to have a nice experience. If you want to read this, I recommend reading it in a recliner or bed. Don't forget the warm drink and the handkerchief. Thank you very much.","Jan 8, 2018 at 10:08 PM",4, 1,
