2022-05-28 19:23:06.041762,reach4thelasers,Another flawed social movie experience,"Problems:

- You get other ""movie go-ers"" jabbering in your ear
- You can see other movie-goers fidging around and mis-behaving
- You can hear the audio from trailers that other movie-goers are watching (some people have their VR on loud-speaker rather than earphones) this feeds back into your audio.

If I wanted a social experience I would be out at a bar, not sitting at home in VR.  Its about time people like CineVR and BigScreen realised this and stopped trying to recreate the cinema-experience (people and all).  Movie-theatres are not social places.  They're movie-watching places.  The fact that other people happen to be there is irrelevant to the core-experience. 

Give up on the social aspect.  IT DOES NOT WORK.","Dec 30, 2019 at 6:25 AM",1, 5,"Hi, you have a ""mute all"" button in the bottom left of the user interface to remove sound from other people. Hope it helps."

2022-05-28 19:23:06.071682,DiaborMagics,All my basic needs  covered (edit 1),"EDIT 1: I've had an issue twice now where the touch controllers were stuck in a fixed position, only able to rotate, or even teleported somewhere else in the virtual space entirely. Both times the 'hands' glitched out like that were when trying to use them in cinevr after ~20 minutes. It doesn't happen often and I'm not even sure if this is caused by cinevr, but only turning off the rift, waiting a couple minutes and restarting again fixes it. It's worth a look into it.

While I'm not one for the social aspect, as I like as little distraction as possible, the Void covers all my basic needs. I can move the screen and zoom in to fit it snuggly into my field of view, I have all the controls I often use and overall, it's the basics of what I was looking for.
What could make it better would be making playlists, having it remember the last environment used and the last settings for the screen used, the ability to set default subtitle and/or audio track or language and finally, integration with Crunchyroll, so I can stream anime comfortably using CineVR.
Currently I have to reselect void every time and set the screen and subtitl4 settings every time. That is annoying. They do get bonus points for setting favorite folders though. That saves time in finding what I need.

As bonus I'd love to be able to play flatscreen games using this app with a controller like on psvr, but I guess that's beyond the scope of a movie app.","Feb 1, 2020 at 6:08 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 19:23:09.169397,Gonzaxpain,Could be great in the future,"First of all the theater itself is great, I love it, probably my favorite of all the apps I've tried. You have full bodies around you instead of only avatars which makes it more realistic and cosy.
 The problem as someone mentioned in another comment is that you cannot browse your own folders which instantly makes it unusable. I also had problems with sound, it would not come out on the rift headphones but the pc  speakers (it was ok with any other app so I don't think it was my problem).

If they correct that this might be my go-to app when it comes to watching movies on a big screen.

By the way, an option to reset your view would be nice, as well.

EDIT: You can already browse your folders and there have been other improvements so I am giving it a well deserved extra star.","Nov 8, 2019 at 3:02 AM",4, 6,

2022-05-28 19:23:09.200314,user045,The Best Environments for Movies,"CineVR, has without a doubt, the best movie environments than all the other movie players out there. My favourite being the Car Drive In with its night atmosphere, sense of scale and feel good colours.

Stability is much improved. I'd love to be able to turn like you can in Big Screen. Or play YouTube videos or Netflix from a browser. Also can't wait to be able to buy and watch movies from this and connect up with others.

Developers I love what you are doing with this but the sound and picture quality doesn't seem to be quite up there with the rest of the movie players. This spoils the quality of playback.","Nov 3, 2019 at 11:48 PM",5, 0,"Thank you, we are still working on improvements for the player quality and upcoming version will be more satisfying :)"

2022-05-28 19:23:09.232229,duskdiver,"Wld be the #1 VR Cinema expernce, but...","... there are 2 bugs which are serious deal breakers - one of which makes me nervous, the other makes movies unwatchable for me (but should be a simple fix).
So let's start with the bugs first:
1. The Unwatchable bug - you have to be holding and using your Touch controller at all times.  If you put your controller down to watch a movie, a small reticle/cursor will appear (controlled by where your headset is pointing).  So when watching a movie, there will be a big white dot at all times at the center of your view that is always moving wherever you turn.
2. The Nervous Bug - Privacy - There's no way that I could find to make a room private so there're always people popping in or out.  I Googled (bc CineVR has no FAQ or documentation on their website), that no one can see what you are watching, but again, if that changes we wouldn't know (so like a year down the line, I could be watching a home movie without knowing someone watching it).  Also, I can't find any info anywhere on how secure or private it is.  So this makes me nervous.

Despite my being unable to use the movie app at all b/c of the annoying white dot, I still find this to be an amazing app.  The picture is really clear (probably the clearest player), you can change seats (Cmoar and Skybox does not allow you to change seats), and it's the 2nd most stable player (after Skybox), and it's a lot less burden on the cpu than Big Screen.  I've tested 20 video files from my pc and only one of them had problems (surprisingly it was an avi file which worked on other players).   

The environments are gorgeous.  I bought the optional environments and they are worth it imho (once I can start watching movies).  Although, I wish they made the Haunted House more creepier (like CMoar's Morgue environment).

So for now it's 3 stars, because even though I can't use it until they fix the reticle, I can see how incredible it can become.  Please fix the reticle asap!","Aug 10, 2019 at 12:12 AM",2, 5,"Hello, thank you for taking the time to write this big review.
For issue #1, we'll have a look at it. It look like it's related to the switch between inputs with a Rift (we use a reticle for Xbox controllers, and hands/lasers when Touch are active).
For issue #2, we are redesigning social features for the next major iteration so that public/private rooms are properly handled.
Additional point on file formats: our player is based on VLC 3.0, so any file that plays on a vanilla VLC should work with CINEVR."
2022-05-28 19:23:12.339917,Goldjones,Tad bit confusing,"I purchased the app three days ago and i still dont know what im doing, i dont know how to purchase movies and the only option i can think of is to buy popcorn but theres not a description so its a gamble.","May 19, 2019 at 9:39 AM",3, 0,"Hi!

2022-05-28 19:23:12.355874,AirBiscuit,"The best method to watch, but flawed","Of the couple of video apps I've tried this has, by far, the best location to view films which is the cinema environment. The 3D viewing options are good, with Flat 180 and 360 video supported, with different frame packing options supported.
The problems ruin it though. No way to mute any people in the theatre making noise, which ruins the app entirely. To watch offline you have to go to the beach, but in the beach there's no way to turn off the sounds of the waves and sea so it's almost as distracting as a child screaming in the always-multiplayer theatre environment.

I don't mind people moving about or blocking my hands in the theatre, I can ignore it. But I can't ignore not being able to hear the film.

From what I can read from the developer responses the problems I have with the app are being worked on which I'm really looking forward to, and when fixed this will be a five star review. But until they are I have to rate it as I experience it right now.","Jan 17, 2019 at 8:44 AM",2, 10,"Thanks for the review, it's very helpful for us to improve the app!

What makes it unusable is the inability to mute the audience. Even with the volume all the way down I'm still listening to other people movies which ruins my movie. Somthing so simple that ruins a potentially great app.","Jan 12, 2019 at 3:48 AM",2, 3,"Hi, thanks for your review.

2022-05-28 19:23:12.402749,Spalman_yt,Pretty good,"I think it is a great app, but for some reason some of my mp4 videos tend to glitch on the screen. They are very distorted and unwatchable (audio plays well tho). I like the fact that you are not alone in the room, but you can't always completely mute other players (even if you set it in the settings). The ambient lights are really cool too.

EDIT: Had to turn down my rating after some more testing. Only few videos are watchable, the rest gets completely distorted and you still can't mute other players.","Jan 4, 2019 at 3:41 AM",2, 0,"Hi thanks for your review and your feedback.

2022-05-28 19:23:15.546341,DJHeroMasta,I Don't Understand....,".....what all the negative reviews are for. I've been using Bigscreen since it was first released and while this isn't perfect, neither is Bigscreen. When I first launched the app I thought all of the Avatars were bots with random bits of speech cues here and there. Come to find out, the host of the room was AFK and I was hearing chunks of his convo between him and his mother. Once I picked up my controllers and started waving at avatars to prove my sanity, I realized they were actual people! Still creeped me out that 90% of them acted like bots but hey. Not everyone's comfortable communicating in a virtual theatre with strangers so I can't complain. The 3D trailers were ""Meh"" and we're starting to make me feel like this app was sub-par but after watching the HD Trailers I was satisfied. While I don't have any friends using this app ATM I'm not 100% sure how everything works exactly but while typing this there are 8 other people watching Taken 2 with me in HD and everyone said it looks crystal clear on their end. I simply click on Library and threw up a movie. It looks like it doesn't matter who the host is so anyone can put something on without needing permission.

I don't want to get ""too into detail"" with the little things as I've only been using it for about 30min or so but the hands are off and don't line up with the position of my hands IRL breaking the immersion. Here's one tip for everyone who uses this, and or Bigscreen, Super-Sample! With Bigscreen, the option to do so is built in. But with this app, you'll want to download an app called ""Oculus Tray Tool"". After launching it, click on ""View & Edit"" next to ""Profiles"". In the bottom left-hand corner of the new window, click on the refresh button. Double click on ""CineVR - The Movie Theatre"" and set the supersampling to 2.0. Click ""Okay"" and then launch the app (CineVR). Feel free to add me if you need help with anything.","Aug 22, 2018 at 1:21 PM",4, 6,"Hi thanks for this very detailed review and for the supersampling pro tip :)

It offers a Virtual Screen, but you can't customize it (that is : move it, curve it, resize it) when Oculus Desktop, Bigscreen and Virtual Desktop allow a full customization of the screen ; it offers different environments, but Virtual Desktop does that at a way higher level (it allows the user to import their own environments in the software and put the screen however they want) ; it allows multiplayer, but again, Bigscreen does that. Finally, it doesn't allow you to use your computer on the virtual screen! Anyway, this is certainly good to discover Cinema VR, but as a Cinema VR app, it sucks, pure and simply.
