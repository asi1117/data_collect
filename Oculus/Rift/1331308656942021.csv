2022-05-28 14:24:13.476431,ChrisJoshNow,Nostalgic and creepy,"This a such a great game, glad I gave it a chance. At first I thought it was just a classic game Simulator, but as you progress and really mess with the environment and listen carefully you reveal a much darker plot. 
Tons of replayability and mini games are relaly fun to play, also the VHS provide many easter eggs to other games and movies.
Bang for your Buck? Price isnt too bad for the experience and replayability but the game is short if you plan on playing it once. it does allow you to replay with NewGame Plus tho.  
Highly reccomended game if you havent tried it.",Jul 24 at 11:41 PM,5, 26,

2022-05-28 14:24:26.084255,Scottus_,Absolutely brilliant!,"I own a Rift S myself and have found no problems with it. I think that this game is perfect for people looking for some nostalgia, the game has got 8-bit games, mini shooting games, a lot of endings, lots of lore, lots of secrets and just about enough horror to make you feel thrilled while playing. Igive this game a 5 star rating because for a price of 15 quid this game is a bargain, it is really worth your time and money. I can't wait for Stress Level Zero to finish off the other two games (Boneworks is another brilliant game that has come out) to complete the lore for this series. Also, I suggest that the comfort level is modified, this game is quite 'comfortable' for the most part but in some scenes it can become 'intense', so I do suggest that the comfort rating is changed to a moderate.","Apr 12, 2020 at 7:03 PM",5, 9,

I guess it was an ok nostalgia trip, but uh...was something else supposed to happen?  If so, it takes waaaay to long to get there.  After an hour I was completely bored, so maybe something exciting happens later.  If so, probably shouldn't make it take so long to get to an interesting part.","Apr 15, 2020 at 9:41 AM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 14:24:26.115172,SpacePirate1221,Fun for a few hours,"It was fun the first time i played, i didn't know what was going to happen. The second time was alright and by the third time there was just no reason to play anymore. Getting all of the ending sounds like a fun quest until you play a few times and realize its the same thing over and over again, with a slight difference at the end. You have to get to level four before anything remotely odd happens, and to level six before the game starts to pick up. and just when that happens, its over. You find out the dog is evil, and then 20 minutes later the game ends. in three hours i got four endings, and have completely lost interest in trying to get the other three. It feels like they just wanted to make it just long enough that you couldn't return it after you were bored, but not too long becuase that would take to much effort.","Apr 14, 2020 at 8:03 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 14:24:26.130132,Hayden_Smoke,Excellent game. Have a few suggestions,".Supports Kazoo
.Supported Player modes: If you're not sitting on the floor for the first part, you're not doing it right. 
.Comfort level: goes from nostalgia rush to DoomSlayer real quick

And now, the suggestions: 

.The physics are a little wonky. For example, grabbing the toy gun will cause other objects to fly about. Please fix that when possible
.Now that I've beaten the Canon storyline, ""Come Face Me"" should be replayable.  It was probably my favorite level.  
Other than that, it's definitely worth a buy! (As long as you have an Oculus Rift CV1, apparently the Rift S has some tracking issues with this one.) Toodles!","Mar 18, 2020 at 12:07 AM",4, 13,

What holds this game back for me though, is the awkward and uncomfortable way you need to position your controller to hold the shotgun. It makes the shooting part of the game even less fun. I also experienced some tracking issues.","Sep 16, 2019 at 12:57 AM",2, 7,

2022-05-28 14:24:32.444972,BustiJewishBoy,Great Horror Shooting Experience!!,"I did not experience tracking issues on the Rift S, like other posts said, while running 1.39 and I haven’t put this game down today. The story is great and is unlike any game I have played before, even though it’s based on the classic Duck Hunt. There are eight levels with waves of ducks to shoot, and it’s quite satisfying. The shotgun you use is a pump shotty so you have to pump it after each shot on normal difficulty. If you don’t have your hands on the gun correctly, then you won’t be able to reload it right and I think this is what people are concerned about with “tracking” issues. All in all, great and creepy game check it out!","Jul 10, 2019 at 8:50 AM",5, 9,

I did one round of duck hunt and thought ""ok, that was cool for a starting round"", but no that's all it is, vr duck hunt. I guess there's more to it near the end but I couldn't stand playind a dozen rounds of the same thing to maybe see something.

My only problem is I notice the game can fight with you if you have the rift s as tracking is bad for this game. Regular rift owners will have no problem. If you can deal with the ocasional tracking issue then you will have much joy in this game.,"Jul 1, 2019 at 8:12 AM",3, 6,

2022-05-28 14:24:35.622617,Muncheez_,Fun Game,"Fun game to play. So many different endings and hidden easter eggs in the game too. Purchased this game when it first came out and never wrote a review until now.  Really didn't expect horror in the game since they didn't have screenshots or mentions of it, or any reviews up on it, since I purchased it when it first got released. It was a nice surprise to me.

I don't like how the all the levels are all the same, same background, same gun, same ducks, etc. The only things that were different were the endings and in between level scenes/interactions.

Overall I liked it . Definitely took me back to my old days of when I was a kid playing Nintendo in the late 80's and early 90's.","Jun 13, 2019 at 12:58 AM",4, 8,

The frightning parts definitely make me not want to play anymore. Downside is there's practically no movement around so it's a living room simulator.

My favorite is ""Kazoo Kid"" hillarous! The duck hunting game gets old though but must be played to advance the game. Each time you play the duck cartridge and and finish a round it gets later and things get weird. Another reivew mentioned stranger things and this game had the same vibe as it progresses.

2022-05-28 14:24:45.049334,DigitalHazard,Really liked it,"I had far more gameplay than the one hour other reviewers mention. It's cool to look around, watch all the VHS videos, play all the games and take a look at all the magazines (getting a hint or two on how to solve the puzzles). Were the 80s really that crappy? I fear yes, hehe ;) Then you end the game and find out at some point you failed or missed something... then you try to find out where and how to make it better. Can everybody survive?

You only end up with one hour, when you play only the Duck Season cartridge, one level after the other, not looking around. If this is how you want to play the game, well then yes maybe you will be disappointed.

If you let the game immerse and amaze you, you will get much more out of it.","May 2, 2019 at 4:38 AM",5, 5,

The sudden Horror twist was genius, jumpscares are non existant in this game, I never got bored, It was a blast, alright, it threw me off guard, took things expressed throughout the game as ""normal"", and then proceeded to flip those things on their head. The cat clock is a strong example, at the beginning of the game, it's ticking. Last few minutes of the game, it's ticking loudly and echoing it's painfully loud meows.

2022-05-28 14:24:51.413588,vtid,"Funny, dark and unpredictable.  Explore!","I bought this game over half a year ago.  This game is like no other.  It's very funny but also has a dark theme running throughout.  It's exciting, and the way that the game progression depends on the actions of the user (without making that clear to the user), is great.  After my first play-through, I wasn't sure I'd get many hours out of this, BUT I keep coming back to uncover the different endings.  They are strangely rewarding and despite completing the game 5 times, each ending has been different (I think they've done this intentionally).  My only negative is that the duck-shooting gets a little boring, but I'd recommend spending some time between each round and discover the various secrets and stuff in the house.  Some of the video tapes are very funny.  You can play 80s style video games and interact with most objects.  I won't say anything else because the discovery throughout the game is the best part.  I can't compare this to any other game that I've played.  It feels unique.","Nov 24, 2018 at 6:10 AM",5, 12,

If they could patch it so your hand snaps to or holds onto the gun better I'd have so much respect for this company.  As it is now, the only time I miss is because my hand is shooting all over the place on a glitchy gun.

A friend recommended this game I'd never heard of.  It looked unique.  So far it's one of the best trying-to-look-like-real-life native vr games I have seen yet.  And creepily it gets even more real, within real.  

I would say it's short... But that does it disservice because it's not a race or a marathon.  It's like a scenario, and the playthrough is actually a little long for one sitting.  It's just the right length, Because of it's art style and how well executed it is, I think I'll get alot of replay out of it and my friends will get a kick out of it.

I found the price a bit high, but I'm glad I got it... I think the developers are really onto something with their whole vision of a game that weirds you out.

2022-05-28 14:25:04.050425,doctor_science,Atmospheric,"This is one of the most interesting games I have played. 

Duck Season plays extremely well to the strengths of VR. It offers a profound sense of immersion reinforced by beautiful textures and animations, humor, and secrets galore. You feel nostalgic inside a dense world begging to be explored. The level of detail in this game is impressive. For example, each object has an unique sound effect when dropped. Text on magazines and books is unique (and usually funny). Objects that appear ordinary usually have more in-game significance than first meets the eye. 

Duck Season avoids awkward locomotion with room-based environments. The touch controllers are integrated well into the game, but the hand avatars and touch gestures are not quite as smooth as ""First Contact"". This is partially due to the 2-handed gun mechanic, where neither touch controller is actually connected to one another. Nevertheless, the developers have created controls that feel natural after a few minutes of practice.

Total playtime is ~2 hours for your first ending. The decision-based endings and myriad easter eggs offer more replay value. I usually hesitate to spend even $20 on a new game, but Duck Season has felt worth it.

I look forward to more titles from Stress Level Zero. I also look forward to other developers learning from Duck Season's strengths for what works in VR: High fidelity objects/environments, mixing humor with narative development, & gameplay that is well-suited for short bursts. For horror-specific games, Duck Season builds a steady sense of dread, without relying on jumpscares or outright gore.","Oct 12, 2017 at 11:35 AM",5, 14,

Pros:


1) The world is nicely detailed; every item seems to have a bit of text and it makes sense.

2) Easy to get most achievements, if you spread out gameplay, you could get one story evert daily and clean up afterwards.  So about one-week worth of gameplay.

3) Feels like the old duck hunt at heart.

4) Humor is at my level.


Cons:
1) Very short, able to complete one ending in just one sitting.
2) No replay ability after you’ve done everything once.
3) Limited gameplay mechanics: Point, Shoot, Reload, Repeat.
4) Don’t like the shooting mechanic.  Wish there were more weapons or options.


Tips:
1) Play on easy, harder difficulties are for later after you complete all the achievements.
2) Watch out for the glowing shell, you don’t want the nuke ending when going for other endings.
3) Some special features will not work until you clear all endings.


Final thoughts:
Generally, I like it as a time waster.  The setting is pretty nice and the slight horror elements are a bit disturbing for about a second, but you have to try to fail!

I think that's just too little content for the price, even if it is high quality.  I think the sale price of $13 is just right for the amount of content there is.  I give it 4 stars because of the high production values.  What this game gets right is the immersion factor in this 80s retro world with all the little details, which unfortunatley, I am old enough to remember.  I actually played the original Duck Hunt and never imagined there would be something like this that would make that seem archaic (I thought I was playing the future then).  I actually enjoyed the shooting part of this game more than the other parts (creepy story).  There are supposedly 7 endings, but I'm not sure I'd want to play this game 7 times to try to experience those different endings.  Still, I had fun and I'm sure I'll be sharing this experience with friends and family.

2022-05-28 14:25:07.219114,EOD2007,Just YES!!! That is all.,"At the time of this review I have only completed one of the supposed 8 endings that are available, that being said, I LOVE THIS GAME. 

The basics:
    (Potential Spoilers Ahead!!) So, before you buy this game, note that it is a HORROR game. My son had watched some youtube videos about this game and told me I should install it, I saw that you could shoot that stupid dog from Nintendo's Duck Hunt, and it was immediately worth the money for me. What my devious 9 year old failed to mention was the fact that this was a HORROR game. Now I am not opposed to horror games, but I usually know that it is a horror game going into it. This was not the case. It should also be noted that this is the first horror game that I have played in VR so I was doubly not ready for the twist at the end. Seriously guys, after level 5 I started getting the creeps, after level 7 or 8 my knees started shaking. After level 9 I had to take a smoke break and rethink my entire life until this point, and after the ending, I changed my underwear and wept into my pillow triumphantly. 

Pros:
-shooting the a-hole dog, repeatedly, like its the point of the game.
-soiling your pants because your 9 year old son is a turd and thinks its funny
-replayability, although this game will admittedly get repetitious trying to find the different endings, its all about that end game baby.
-YOU'RE PLAYING A NINTENDO (not a nintendo due to copyrights or whatever) and you can actually blow into the cartridge, just like old times!!

Cons:
-Sh****ng your pants!
-Repetitiveness
-Dying in the game (and a little inside)

In all, if you were ever a fan of the old Duck Hunt game and want a new, horrifying take on the classic, this game is worth the coin, just make sure you have a change of underwear and some baby wipes at the ready. Consider yourself warned.","Sep 28, 2017 at 12:41 PM",5, 9,

I was flooded with nostalgia and really got the sense that I was 12 again, with zero responsibility, spending an entire Saturday parked in front of the TV. The story element of the game is well done, lulling you into a false sense of security, then dropping increasingly overt hints as to the twisted turns ahead. When it gets really f-ed up, I'm reminded of Max Payne or Far Cry games where you're drugged up and running through a bizarro version of the world. Beyond the nostalgia and story, the actual duck hunting is surprisingly fun! However, the shooting/reloading mechanics are a little awkward and don’t live up to the gunplay in games like Robo Recall. Despite its minor flaws, Duck Hunter is one of the most unique games I’ve ever played (visually, emotionally, psychologically, etc.) and really uses VR to its fullest.

Often it would jump off while I was trying to reload. That was more challenging than shooting the ducks.

This turned out to not be a flaw and I felt it was well exploited, for lack of better terms, to encourage further exploration.

Pros: It’s playable from sitting, standing or room-scale.  I keep picking it back up and playing for longer than expected.  The graphics and gun/grab physics are clean and very precise.  I can go from shooter mode to explorer mode at will.  I always find new, fascinating things each play.

Cons:  I felt like flaws I’ve seen in other VR games may have existed in this game initially due to a lack of teleportation, though this wasn’t really a concern after I spent more time exploring.","Oct 21, 2017 at 3:15 PM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 14:25:19.832776,Kratuln,Overpriced for what's delivered.,"Very boring gameplay that revolves around you sitting in a single room and playing a game of Duck Hunt in VR with a shotgun that's cumbersome to use. You play a few rounds of Duck Hunt before the game comes to an end.

There's multiple endings based on what you do but what you're looking at is about an hour or two of gameplay to beat it and to be expected to play it six more times to get the other endings. Sorry but at it's core it's a very simple wave based shooter(Where you'll at max see four birds on screen at a time). The horror aspects in the game aren't remotely scary(Even if you're easily prone to these things) and it takes right up until the end of the playthrough to deliver.

Can't recommend for the asking price, way too expensive and more like a demo you'd play for free to try get people into VR.","Sep 19, 2017 at 7:03 AM",2, 11,
2022-05-28 14:25:19.848733,mrgreen72,"Touch has proper grab buttons, use them.","I love the concept, the production values and the insane video tapes you unlock, but for a game about shooting a shotgun, the mechanics feel downright broken. Probably because of the dodgy auto-grip feature, pumping the shotgun fails randomly and it generally feels like the gun has a mind of its own. your pumping hand keeps detaching and the shoulder mechanic just doesn't work imo. Hopefully they can improve on it because the game has a lot of potential!","Sep 17, 2017 at 11:46 AM",3, 3,

When I first played, it entertained me for about 30 minutes, then I thought I would be done with it, because the gameplay gets quite stale. About a week later I came back, and saw all the trippy/ scary story elements, and since then have played through the game at least 4 times. Despite having limited gameplay, the story and different endings will have you coming back over an over. I love it! The only reason I can't justify giving this 5 stars is because of the repetitive gameplay, but seriously dont let that stop you!","Oct 10, 2017 at 1:17 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 14:25:22.955015,Arranox,Good game for the asking price.,"i saw a few reviews of people saying it was too short for the asking price. but when i tried it myself, i found that the game had supriceingly much content considering that duck season is just about shooting ducks. and you have 3 different difficulty levels and its a game with alot of replayability value. so 20$ is not a high asking price for a polished content rich minigame like this.

i think this game could be a great game to play rounds with friends, and don`t tell them about the plot twist :D","Sep 23, 2017 at 8:44 PM",5, 7,

2022-05-28 14:25:23.006876,The_Jablonski,Great game! Hilarious!,"So, what I expected and what I got with this game were very different, but that's a good thing! We all remember duck hunt and the nostalgia it conjures. This is not your father's duck hunt. It's like 3d VR duck hunt with a story and some humor! I really appreciated the humor the developer added to the game. Without it the game would be relatively bland as the actual duck hunting won't keep you enthralled for very long the humor and story keep you hooked between levels. Sadly though, I have to question the replayability and I can't see myself playing it more than maybe 2 or 3 run throughs to see the alternate endings. I was able to beat the game in an hour or two and really enjoyed the game so don't get me wrong I did very much enjoy my experience. I think it's worth 19.99 to 29.99 but don't expect a game that you'll play a thousand times. Enjoy it for what it is and whatever you do, don't piss off the dog!","Oct 1, 2017 at 10:16 AM",4, 3,

Its a rather basic play-thru and will take 60-90 minutes you first time depending how much messing around you do and you'll get to an ending.  

The game has 7 different endings and different achievements.  The endings will require you to spend time messing around in the house to find triggers for the other endings for the most part.

There is a lots of stuff in the living room and secrets room as well. They are fun to discover as well. Stuff that is nothing with ducks at all (mini games etc). Its also a experince too.

One issue throught. The ducks should fly faster after you completed about 3 endings and more easy to fly away. There was no advance here, and that can been quite boing in the last.
