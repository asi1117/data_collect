2022-05-28 19:30:22.620071,the_random_kid123,Excellent space simulation,"this was one of the first VR experiences that i played after setting up my new PC. If you are looking to take the controlls of a spacecraft, or learn about some of the most historic space missions to date, you can't do better this game. An excellent experience for space nerds, i love the checklist and the shadows, and the simple act of being able to click buttons in the spacecraft even when it served no purpose (such as depressurising the cabin or flickering the lights) really helped the immersion. Excellent price, would definitely recommend if you love NASA.

Notes for the dev: well done on this incredibly accurate sim, i would love it if other levels or other games could be made that include missions like Gemini, Apollo or the Space Shuttle",Feb 11 at 8:40 PM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:30:22.635032,David Wagner ITTR,Great sim,"I loved the first mission and I’m glad that the option to fast forward time between checklists was added in, though I enjoyed the audio in between, I wouldn’t want to wait the duration every time I replay. I’m looking forward to mission 2 and beyond. It would be amazing if the dev could go on to create a Gemini sim and then Apollo. It’d be a lot of work but seeing what this dev did with this sim I’m sure it’d be jaw dropping. Great quality! Seriously can’t wait to play more.","Jan 21, 2020 at 7:51 PM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 19:30:22.648994,robert.sopin,I love the game but,I love space so I love this game but I can’t get past the first mission during the landing sequence it never makes it back to earth just keeps bouncing off the atmosphere,"Dec 12, 2018 at 4:03 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 19:30:22.663954,Banshee14,An Awesome Simulator for Space Geeks!,"I got in on this game when it was still in Alpha on Kickstarter and I can say it hasn't disappointed.  I grew up with the US Space Program in the 60's and 70's.  I've always been fascinated by the entire history and I have jumped on every space sim that has ever come along but this is as close to the real thing as I've ever seen.  The attention to detail is wonderful.  Hearing actual capsule radio communications during flight (especially at liftoff!) was an awesome touch!!

I bought into this sim knowing up front it wasn't a game.  It is what I was hoping for and more.  The different missions keep it interesting with more to come with time.  From the best of my knowledge about the spacecraft and the Mercury astronauts, this sim is pretty darn authentic right down to the interior changes in the capsule as the missions progressed.

Sometimes I just enjoy the exterior view of the rocket and capsule through liftoff for the sheer beauty of the act!

I don't know how hard it would be to implement but maybe a mode option for skpping from critical event to critical event would be a good idea.  It would keep the less patient enthralled and get a better feel for the sim.

What I wouldn't give for an Apollo sim this historically accurate.  Gemini missions would be fun too but I'd be all in on Apollo.  I could see myself working a two week long mission to the moon in near real time.  I have a somewhat decent moon lander sim, albeit limited in scope but I have never seen an interactive Apollo CM sim.    Then there is always the Space Shuttle to think about. 

In the mean time, I will be looking forward to the remaining Mercury missions.  There is a lot of history to experience in these early manned NASA flights.  Space geeks like myself will really enjoy this!","Sep 25, 2018 at 12:49 PM",5, 13,

Touch controller ARE supported but not listed as a supported controller option here. My only real complaint is why that music has to be so loud? Anyway, I do feel this game could do with some additions and changes. First up, I really want to turn off the radio as the information being said isn't what is currently happening. Like the ""thousands of lights"" that circle the craft. I realise doing that in game would create a serious lag for people with lower end PC's, but I personally would have loved to have seen that. 

While we're on the topic of sound, PLEASE give us the option to turn off that music. Talk about loud! Did I already mention that? For the Ultra Graphic's setting, I would have liked a more HD starscape and Earth textures. Don't get me wrong, I was completely blown away with the view, but the stars seemed a bit blurry and earth looked like I was looking at a google earth image close up. Not sure if that was just me, but there you have it. Now it terms of additions, I want to see a free roam mission envolving a space station and some satilites (docking, undocking, repair and deployment all freely done in an open world environment), and a free roam mission for taking off and landing again at will. I also want to have some thrust controls beyond simple turning. 

Also, maybe a Top Secret mission involving a UFO and/or some weapons testing. With the amazing detail you have put in here, that would be amazing to see and I believe you would do it so incredibly well. I realise its not historical, but a bit of sci-fi  wouldn't hurt and would only add to the replay value in the long run.","Jun 22, 2018 at 9:28 AM",4, 7,
