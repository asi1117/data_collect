But I am so glad I gave this game a chance. This is like space cats with lasers but on steriods. Absolutely love the psychedelic dream like vibe this game gives. Music is fantastic too. Well worth the $20. Give it a try. The devs nailed it.,Aug 9 at 6:58 AM,5, 7,

ays shoot me ups like crazy. Gradius, Salamander, Gradius III, Populus, R-type, Crazy Comets, when 3d polygon games came out like star fox I thought wow the future of space ship shoot em ups is looking bright but then came open world and open universe which left  no room for that classic formulary but now we have VR and Yuki has brought it back and it's hardcore, it's great fun for 30 minutes to an hour and pick up and play rogue like gameplay, great graphics, very different to Pixel Ripped but has the same charm but with more replay value.",Aug 24 at 10:21 PM,5, 3,
