2022-05-28 19:23:57.509106,CryptoHexPirate,Had for a year - Still $hite,"Just a ""temple run"" style app in VR, with no touch support and head tilting for steering. Especially annoying when you effortlessly ski uphill. When I first bought this game a year ago I hoped there might be an update in the pipeline but it still seems devs just R&R on this (released and ran). FancySkiing is very ironically named as it's kind of game you'd expect on low end VR units like a crudboard, not an Oculus franky, the contrary empitomy of a fancy skiing experience as the name implies. What a waste, such a shame :(","Dec 7, 2017 at 4:27 AM",1, 11,
2022-05-28 19:24:00.623775,shobley,Not working at all,"Does not appear to work with any kind of controller. Disappointing that the touch controllers are not supported at all in the Oculus release.


I have bought this version, and the version available on Steam - that one supports the touch, but is still very buggy. It only lets you play about 1/3 of the course, and then once you hit ""Game Over"" you can no longer pick up the ski poles and have to restart the computer to try to play again.

However, the 2 mins play you DO get is awesome. Really is an ideal VR game.","Oct 25, 2017 at 7:07 AM",1, 5,
