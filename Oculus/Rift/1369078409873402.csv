2022-05-28 16:25:57.364612,Boberson,Good game / needs better anti toxicity,"This game is one of my favorite all time games, unless you are considering that I have been playing echo/VR for more than 4 years. The concept is fantastic congrats to the Oculus and Ready at Dawn studios for making this game. But on the other side, the game needs some bug fixes but it just seems to be delayed. That's the issue. Going on, one bug that may have been fixed already is the smacking the wall bug making your character completely halt in place, that makes the game annoying to play and gives the other team an advantage. Lastly, the worst of the game is by far the community said by many other than me. The community is ""garbage"" specifically in the 12 and under age group, with that, that age group is prone to be toxic, again, said by many before. So one thing that would be awesome that could make the game more enjoyable is for employees to roam around echo VR finding the people that are toxic and disrespectful, or the game can be given a vote to kick opportunity or a vote to ban system in which someone has more that ""number"" amounts of bann votes they will be banned. but the vote to ban system can be abused, so the person will need to either write a review on the report or look at report logs to see how many times that person was reported at once.

Thank You if you're reading this.",Apr 5 at 10:11 AM,4, 23,
2022-05-28 16:25:57.381567,Harold,Long Time Player Here!,"This game has the potential to be incredible and the biggest game in vr, however there are too many things holding it back. The mechanics in this game are amazing and through most of my hours havent let me down. The community is like a double edged blade, on one hand it can be the friendliest place and on the other hand it can be the most horrible and toxic environment in any game i've ever come across. The matchmaking is a complete joke and i have never once enjoyed the public games, leading to using a different kind of matchmaking not even handled by RAD (which is vrml however i will not write about this in a review on the game). In normal matchmaking you will have, a european server when you are not from europe (or vice versa) leading to bad ping, a completely toxic game (usually) with horrible skill matchmaking (9 times out of 10 you will either completely lose or completely win). The matchmaking ruins alot of this game since there isn't a good mmr system in place. The administrators and moderators in this game are terrible from everything i have seen and to my knowledge are non-existant. I've seen too many kids screaming racial slurs and i have yet to see them banned from reports. Which moves me on to my next point, there is no report system put in place inside the game. If you would like to report a player you have to go onto the website (which is heavily out of date and barely works) and send in a ticket about a player. This however does absoloutly nothing and on the incredibly rare occasion that they decide to ban someone, they ban a non-toxic player for playspace abusing IN THE LOBBY (because this definately gives the player an advantage in game). All in all this game is absoloutely ridiculous and should still be in beta, the friends that carry on playing are the only reason i come back to this game. It is a challenege to enjoy this game.",Apr 27 at 10:27 AM,2, 6,"Hey there, thanks for taking the time to write up this review. We’ve shared your feedback about matchmaking to the rest of the team. As for reports, our Account Admin Team (report@echo.games) processes player reports during the week (Monday-Friday) to take action on Echo VR Code of Conduct violations. If you send them an email with any evidence you have, the player’s username, and a description of what happened, they will review it and will let you know if action is taken. More information about our Echo VR Code of Conduct and reporting can be found here: https://bit.ly/EchoVR_COCReporting . Additionally, we know email reporting is a difficult process, and are working on an in-game reporting system, as well as other ways to address toxicity in-game (Deeplinking, Early Quits & Leaves, Live Moderation, etc). More information about this can be found in our January Dev log here: https://bit.ly/3vJZtr2 ."
2022-05-28 16:25:57.397524,Lemieux6687,"Great Game, Bad Community","The game itself handles very well and has loads of potential, sadly I can't play the game without having the mute all option on 24/7. If you're looking for a fun game to play for hours this is it, but be prepared to not talk to anyone for hours or get your ears blasted by 13 year olds screaming.",3 days ago,2, 0,
2022-05-28 16:25:57.413481,Greyedeigh,Solid game - fair rules!,"I keep coming back to this game, closing in on my 1000th game played - ALL in casual lobbies. I'm still not great but it is almost always fun, with skill-based play (no ""booster upgrades"" or ""reduced stun duration"" unlocks for example), so a pro player is playing by the same rules as a newbie. Lag can be an issue, but is rarely game-ruining and there are enough fun and mature folks around to party up with to keep me playing. Full games are about 8-10 mins, longer if it goes into overtime, so it's good to be able to play a few and put it down for a bit. Spend some time learning to pass, re-grab and set up plays and you'll have hundreds of hours of fun, plus a good bit of cardio! Looks and runs best on a PC, but Quest 2 standalone is still very solid.

Edit - the missing star! Would be 5 stars if there were quicker methods of muting people. Currently going into the arm computer takes you out of the game for too long...

The other issue is kind of related; key remapping. It would be nice to be able to rebind the boost/push-to-mute buttons I don't use to a ""push-to-silence"" button to hold down and select a name to mute or unmute. Think Alyx's gun selector thumbstick, but with people's names. Other use for rebinding would be to move the back booster to my unused push-to-mute button to save my poor thumbstick's silicon!

Honestly though - best replay value, especially for free. Cheers!",Apr 8 at 5:45 AM,4, 5,
2022-05-28 16:25:57.430436,Jexton,Devs are 'thinking about' the toxics,"Look, I get it - it's free and has a fun robot on the front, so you think it's a great game for your 7 year old.  They will immediately be surrounded by people spewing hate, racism, and general toxicity.  

There are two modes of play: 
Mode 1, turn on mute all and then try to play.
Mode 2, join a game, immediately hit the oculus button, click 'report abuse' and wait for one of the eight year olds to start shouting racist vitriol.

The game itself has the potential to be a 5 star, but the community is awful. I'm not convinced the developers care.",Mar 16 at 8:36 AM,1, 16,"Hey there, sorry to hear you had negative experiences in-game. In a January Dev Log our team discussed our roadmap for the year which included several tools/features (deep linking, early quit penalties, in-game reporting) to help players connect with friends and to address toxicity in-game. In addition to these tools/features, our team is working to expand our live moderation program in-game so that action can be taken more quickly when violations occur.

2022-05-28 16:26:00.548097,some1cool,not bad,the game itself is very fun but latetly i had some issuse with the preformence. i have rtx 2060 and AMD ryzen 5 3500 6 core and im at the lowest settings and it still runs at 20 fps when im lucky. i also checked in the task manager whats taking so much from my pc and its just the echo vr... fix that please,Apr 28 at 2:25 AM,2, 0,

2022-05-28 16:26:00.578017,Hug-,Community is horrible,"Rampant amounts of pedos, and a very drama based community. If you can handle that, it’s fun. Personally worst community in any vr game ever, and I’ve seen them all 

Been playing for roughly 4 ish years, recent changes have gotten me to stop playing vr all together",Mar 10 at 1:14 PM,1, 7,"Hey there, sorry to hear you had negative experiences in-game.

2022-05-28 16:26:00.592977,AceKingPanda,It WOULD be good...,It would be a good game if I didn't get called racial slurs by unsupervised children in every lobby. No method to report. No punitive action. It shouldn't be my responsibility to selectively mute half of every lobby that I join.,Mar 3 at 1:43 AM,1, 13,
2022-05-28 16:26:00.609932,YoungAtlas,Good Concept but VERY buggy still,"Edit: If wrist angle settings were given more inbetween pecentages, this would drastically reduce players physical pain. Currently, you need to hold your arms & wrists at sometimes painful angles to throw straight.

The concept is fun but the game needs a lot of work. A reation time based game needs better latency and a lot less lag. Even in PCVR with the best wifi and lowest graphic settings, it can still become a problem. Hitboxes on players & the disc also don't work half the time.

Overall fun concept, but still needs more time working out all the bugs",Apr 4 at 9:42 AM,3, 0,
