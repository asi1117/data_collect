2022-05-28 20:40:01.504045,MarcoBad,Nice metaphor,"2 stars for the quality of the game, very poor and fast boring.
5 stars for the idea: imagine that the castle is your house(s) and your money; now imagine that the lady sharks are your divorcing wife (ves). Great metaphor ;-)","Feb 6, 2021 at 10:44 PM",3, 0,

I mean shooting the potassium out of them seems pretty crazy on it's own, but apparently sharks with legs want to get to me through magical barriers too. This is a wave shooter that has you defending a tower in a ridiculous way. It's funny and free, worth checking out if not just to ponder what Bent Light Industries is tripping on.","Apr 23, 2020 at 2:38 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:40:01.533965,fayewray71,Pretty Fun!,"Took a minute to figure out the mechanics, but basically you are shooting these shark things on four sides while they are eating down your defenses.  You get a repair ducky which you can use to repair your entry ways as they come down, so it is a balancing act with 12 second intervals between waves.  I really like it a lot!","Mar 15, 2020 at 5:46 AM",4, 10,"Thanks for the review! We are glad to hear you are enjoying our game!
