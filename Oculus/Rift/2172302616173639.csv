2022-05-28 13:34:46.768525,SherlockElite,A must have in VR,"Really, it's absolutely great, fun, well done, approachable and hard enough for the most hardcore gamers.",Feb 1 at 9:55 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 13:34:46.784482,ArsonistZombie,"Great game, ruined by the tracklist.","It's insane how such a fun concept can be absolutely driven into the ground by being stuck alongside some of the most vile choices for music. Seriously, the OG tracks are just awful. And I'm not even talking an expected split in quality. Every rhythm game has it's stinkers. But with Audica, it's the complete opposite. Good luck getting your money's worth out of the  4~/30 songs that you can actually tolerate. For those people saying custom music excuses this? So it's on (unsupported) modders nowadays to actually make a game worth the retail value? That definitely makes a bunch of sense. Harmonix won't flex their connections to actually deliver decent music, nor will they fully support modding the game, cause that would jeapordize the aforementioned connections they refuse to cash in on. I genuinely couldn't say whether the choice of music is more insulting, or the fact that it's basically a shell, a working concept that only exists so random, unpaid map makers can populate it with music. No amount of shame is enough to bring to account the same company that's been delivering solidly on console rhythm games since their conception. Thanks for the complete and utter ""meh"" you've given the VR community, Harmonix.","Mar 15, 2021 at 3:49 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 13:34:46.798445,hazed_blue,My Favorite Unwinding Experience,"I've put more hours into this game than any other in VR.  It's a great visual and mental challenge, with tons of depth available as you get better.  It may not be as physically demanding as other rythm games, but its format really lets you get into it and be as physical as you want.  Plenty of variety in music and mapping styles.   Just plain fun to play!","Feb 16, 2021 at 10:01 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 13:34:46.813405,EverythingWillBeOk,Best rhythm game since Rock Band,"Seriously, this game feels so great to play. Also don't worry if the soundtrack isn't your thing, there is an active custom songs community that has made hundreds (soon to be thousands) of songs of all genres. If you pick the game up, come join the customs community on discord!","Dec 5, 2020 at 3:54 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 13:34:46.828365,mungomax,Highly addictive!,I thought beat saber was addictive but this is so much fun! If anyone has a problem where they can't see the DLC songs on the oculus store (PC) i uninstalled the game and reinstalled it and they all appeared in the extras tab in game.,"Jan 10, 2021 at 11:32 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 13:34:49.974036,Mecklar,Works well but DLC does not show up,"The game is good but have bought dlc and it does not appear in game,  not had any issue with any other game, beat saber the dlc shows up immediatly, have restarted the game multiple times and tried everything else i could think of and still nothing..","Jan 3, 2021 at 2:59 AM",1, 0,"Hello! Please check the Oculus store pages for the DLC you are missing and manually download if given the option. If not, please contact Oculus Support."
2022-05-28 13:34:49.988996,zidolos,One of the better VR games.,No it's not beat saber.  It's way different and that's good. If you've gotten a decent fill of cutting blocks come try shooting some shapes. Also unlike the earlier mentioned game this game is crossbuy so you get to enjoy buffed up graphics at home and have a solid performer on the go for one price. Tons of custom songs available too thanks to the Osu converter creator as well as a developing map making community. You'll have fun,"Dec 7, 2020 at 1:59 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 13:34:50.004954,MeepsKitten,nothing like it,by far the best flow in any VR rhythm game. extremely fun and satisfying to play and watch,"Dec 5, 2020 at 4:55 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 13:34:50.020911,sycolution,No in game language settings,"I'm fluent in Japanese, but not THAT fluent. I can't read fast enough during the tutorial to understand what's happening before I need to do stuff. Fix it and I'll change my review. The oculus language settings didn't change it and oculus platform doesn't have a ""boot in English"" command line like steam.","Feb 9, 2021 at 1:11 AM",1, 0,"Sorry you're experiencing this issue. Have you tried uninstalling/reinstalling and then selecting your preferred language setting? If you continue having issues, please contact us at support.harmonixmusic.com"
