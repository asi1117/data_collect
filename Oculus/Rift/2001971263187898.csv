2022-05-28 15:52:57.512486,kuroko,A Father and Son's new fav,"I was uncertain at first given some of the older reviews but I trusted the newer ones and was not dissapointed.

Even at full price, the ability to cross play was well worth it and my seven year old have been having a blast hacking and slashing together in multiplayer.

The roguelite RPG elements of building up your gear and character are there which will keep me interested for some time to come.

Good game and the devs are keeping it fresh it seems (regular posts in the games updates)","Oct 28, 2020 at 12:59 AM",5, 18,Thank you for the good review kuroko! We certainly made some major improvements recently and are constantly working to give our users the best experience possible :)

2022-05-28 15:53:00.649096,GreenCatGuy,Waste of money,"The only time I would really recommend this game is if it's on sale. This is one of the most boring and janky VR games I've played. Almost nothing is really made clear to you, as the tutorial really only tells you the most basic stuff. I still have no idea of how half of these mechanics work. Also the enemies in this game are so boring, there's legitimately only three enemy types that I've come across so far. Also for some reason, my character's arms are wayyyy too short, I feel like a T-rex when I play this game, and not in a good way.","Jun 24, 2020 at 9:47 AM",2, 4,Very sorry that you didn't enjoy the game.

2022-05-28 15:53:03.840560,Yuki_Nagato,An amazing multiplayer experience,"An amazing multiplayer experience
The sense of progression of the recent patch really added a lot to the enjoyment of the game. Me and my friends play this game quite a bit now.
Just grinding through multiple floors and progressing our characters base strength and the levels you get temporarily as you go into the dungeon. Depending on the run and the buffs and debuffs you get, the optimal weapon and tactic to use subtly changes.
There are multiple melee weapon types as well, each of them having a unique way of using them with strengths and weaknesses. It's really finely crafted.

And the dev team even adds more and more as time goes on. Really excited to play it more once they add more enemy types!","Dec 27, 2019 at 7:04 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 15:53:03.855520,FFHKAery,This is the ONLY Review that Matters,"First of all, there are 4+ types of new weapons that have been added in the ~2 months since the global open beta.
There is smooth turning, just close the level and go into the settings in the menu.
There ARE more ways to enjoy the game than the (admittedly tedious) defend the tower mode. There are global skin tournaments on the leaderboard, there is a hardcore gargantua mode which offers one of the most intuitive and challenging experiences on the rift. 
For the people that say that $20 is an unfair price, they must also know that this game came out not even a month ago when their reviews were made, and in that time the SMALL TEAM OF DEVS has made many weapons, gamemodes, and enhancements that flesh out the game tenfold.... And this will continue. 

TL:DR Give the game a chance, ((other than the comments about the weak story, which is a completely valic and true point)), most, if not all of these reviewers aren't willing to really get involved in the game and the community.","Aug 10, 2019 at 5:22 PM",5, 30,
2022-05-28 15:53:03.870480,ryanjamesholford,"Love the combat, but nothing to do","Combat system feels amazing, parrying, blocking, enchanting, and dodging are so nice to have and feel fluid when fighting. You will punch your wall at least once, I promise.

Unfortunately this is overshadowed by a story that's nonexistant once you get into the campaign. Eventually the campaign turns into a grind to get better weapons that deal more damage and you just deal with more of the same basic enemy types (with different colors).

Multiplayer is only one mode: Defend the pillar.
I really was hoping for an immersive coop boss hunting experience with my friends, but it just turned into us wacking enemies after they aggro'd to the pillar, it's nowhere near as intense as the combat in single player. A solution would be to turn the campaign into a 2-player coop session where you don't need to defend a pillar and can just have a good time with a buddy.

Progression is the exact same as robo recall. Do the challenges, get the stars, get the weapon, repeat. I'm fine with this as an EXP grind would suck for this game.

Hoping that eventually this all gets updated and they add more modes and enemy types. ALSO ADD SMOOTH TURNING PLEASE.","Jun 8, 2019 at 3:22 AM",3, 56,
2022-05-28 15:53:03.886438,DrawnOut,Not a fan of always on connectivity.,"I do not understand why I am required  to be connected online to play single player.  You cannot play this game unless you allow it to connect.  This really should be an optional feature, since the majority of the game is single player focused.","Aug 4, 2019 at 9:24 AM",2, 2,"I understand your frustration with ""always on"" but we need it in order to keep track of player's scores as well as account information. We do try to keep a balance of multiplayer-single player options and hopefully in the future you can check out the new game types incoming."
2022-05-28 15:53:06.985150,kINGxxxReezus,Extremely Underwhelming,"How can a game release and cost money while only offering a tutorial and a single defense mission. There is no alpha or beta in the title, nor is this called a demo. This is a poor excuse of a game and unfortunately this type of development plagues many other VR titles. While the combat isn't bad, I feel cheated after the tutorial offered me nothing but a good concept and a underdeveloped product. This shouldn't be called a full game but a demo then I would at least give this game more then 1 star. If this game was free I couldn't complain at all. The fact remains it's marketed as a complete game and it isn't.

Developers please take your time and release a full game like any other platform would do. VR is an amazing experience but is being sold short by games developed exactly like this. I shouldn't have to wait until after the game releases to hopefully get more then a single mission. This kind of game development only hurts this platform and I don't think that VR can ever be taken serious enough to be considered over a Playstation, Xbox or Pc title if this is how games are going to be created. PLEASE DO BETTER!!!","Jun 9, 2019 at 4:02 PM",1, 15,
2022-05-28 15:53:07.000109,Invictus24,Beta with more levels,"As someone who has played the beta, I can tell you that they have not added much to the game. I saw the same multiplayer as the Beta and it's nothing special to advertise. They could have added so much to the multiplayer, but instead they decided to leave it the same; even though they could have added so much.

The Levels
The levels are extremely fun to jump into on single player and fend off the soldiers, but it can get tiring and less exciting as you go on. And you also start to feel like the levels are kind of thrown together due to the fact that the opponets are just the same old thing you went against last time. And the characters, the reason that I talk about the Characters in the Level catagory, is because of the fact that they are usually the same opponets as you progress through the levels. So it just starts to feel worn-out and boring. And it doesn't feel like you advance when you start with one level's map and go to a new one, then go back to the one you started with. It just feels like a cycle of grinding.

The Multiplayer
It's just the exact same as the Beta. I thought they would add so much more, because they're was only one level in the Beta and still one level in the current version, but they decided to leave it the same. But I completely beleive they will add more to it, because they show another level in the trailer with a multiplayer level that isn't currently in the release. If you are going to advertise multiplayer for a game that only has one multiplayer level, then you should add more multiplayer levels; and if you don't it's basically a scam. The reason I say that it would be a scam if you don't is because you advertise a multiplayer level in the trailer that isn't in the game yet. But, I know that they most likely will, so wait until they do add more levels for multiplayer.

 I would go on and on about it, but there is a word limit on the review, so to wrap it up, ADD MORE TO THE MULTIPLAYER.","Jun 11, 2019 at 5:01 AM",3, 11,"We appreciate you taking the time to write up such a detailed response. Just to clarify the multiplayer, there are 4 difficulty settings for multiplayer, Beginner, Normal, Hard and Gargantua. The first three difficulties are set in the same stages and the enemy varies depending on your performance, meaning the stronger you are the more difficult the enemy becomes, while in Gargantua difficulty, you'll go up against the giant boss. I hope this at least clears how to access some of the content you saw in the trailer."
2022-05-28 15:53:07.015069,Endslayer123,,"The gameplay itself feels good, and the combat is great. But the motion blur it starts you out with is unbearable, and you cant change it until you quit the game and go to the menu. By the 10th quest or so, it was the same 3 enemies in the same room. Nothing changed to keep me intrigued. Then I tried to play multiplayer with my friend (who is on the same network as me) and we ended up having the exact same ID and couldnt play together.","Jun 7, 2019 at 10:04 AM",2, 29,
2022-05-28 15:53:07.032024,taquitobuddy,"Fair price, but wish it offered more","First, $20 is a fair price for what you get here.  The basic gameplay/mechanics are really good, some of the best melee combat to be had in VR.  Unfortunate the game doesn't do a lot with it.  There are a good variety of weapons with different characteristics which is nice, but to unlock some of them is frustrating and not fun at all.  The 100 solo missions get repetitive after about 30 and are mostly filler after that.  The only multiplayer mode just isn't very good at all.  I hope these devs take the melee combat gameplay here and make a ""full"" game with it one day.  For now, not a bad price if you just want some melee combat fix in solo mode every now and then.","Jun 19, 2019 at 12:49 PM",3, 11,

Stuck in one room over and over doing the same thing over and over is not immersive, it’s lazy writing. Also, k tried to refund after 1 hr and was denied.

2022-05-28 15:53:10.156667,fujimori,Crazy Good Game!!,"Just an amazing game.  Really unlocking the potential of what we can start to expect in the near future from VR games and the Oculus Quest.  

After playing, I wanted a dedicated room just to play VR games so that you don't destroy anything in real life playing this game.  You get immersed into their world.

I can literally play this game for days on end.  Crazy good game.

Good story, tutorials, and the sword battles are epic.  Wow.

ALSO as a VR YouTuber I have to turn my guardian system off so it doesn't show up and spoil my videos. I was so engrossed in the game during mulitplayer I smacked my finger into my wall with full force. But don't worry my controller and the wall is fine!

2022-05-28 15:53:10.187585,Jargonous,Fighting and controls,"Fighting mechanics are pretty good, but the controls need work. It would be nice if there was a co-op campaign rather than being limited to fighting by yourself to get better weapons. Put together a resource system that allows players to pool in upgrades for their weapon of choice (higher durability, better damage, better parry/block hitboxes).","Jun 9, 2019 at 5:32 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 15:53:10.203556,Megalithik,Dont buy for cross-platform multiplayer,"Was excited to have a game come out finally that seemed pretty good and would let Rift/Quest play together.  Well.... that's a huge disappointment.

Yes you can play together for sure, but its limited to one single defender type mission on one map with up to 4 players.  You can not unlock any new weapons in this mode nor do you really have any type of progression in this mode besides clearing the previous difficulty to unlock the next difficulty that's the extend of progression.

Huge disappointment.  I thought this had a coop campaign or something in it.  Played this defend the thing mode for like an hour and i'm already bored to death of it.

The Single Player mode isn't much better, it's again one single map and it's just an empty rectangle with guys spawning in .  Completing rounds in here unlocks different weapons for you to try every so often that you can use in the multiplayer mode.  They all say 'level 1' though so I'm not sure if there is or was suppose to be a way to level things up but so far i haven't seen anything like that.

This game strikes me as very much a 'minimum viable product'.  Im only not refunding it because it was 20 bucks, i'll wait and HOPE they add stuff and fill out the game.  But if it had have been 30 bucks i'd have refunded this.","Jun 10, 2019 at 1:09 AM",3, 2,
