2022-05-28 19:27:50.730322,Dan-Cainenstien-1,By Cainenstien,"Son of a pastor 1853-1890, Van gogh, If I remember the history, he cut off a part of his left ear, made 9 self portraits and shot himself died in a field. I would say his style is only for a few conceptualize persons and a lost to those. "" There-for I would like to seen more of the arts in this format "".  But now we cross over to the twilight zone to the enter limits of the mind. His eyes, skill set and soul is about abstract expressionism. 900 paintings and 1,100 drawings will never be seen. He was driven to communicate his emotions thru his portraits. This was his life and struggle. ""Do you really want to dare jump in this soulless abstract mind set  IN his portraits 

 ? "" ("" Im not the one going to lake view center."" ) ps. the other reviews sound like they came from borrowed light studios. Ya ! If you read this please hit the hand.","May 30, 2018 at 2:50 AM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 19:27:50.745282,acmartin3,A beautiful experience,"I never imagined that VR could be this. It was surreal, sad and beautiful. I was able to take a seat, right across from Van gogh and catch a tiny glimpse of what it must've been like to see France through his eyes.

A definite experience for all.","Nov 18, 2017 at 3:18 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 19:27:50.760242,FastLawyer,"Nice, detailed environment","Just realize there isn't much to do other than explore and listen to the music.  Still, I think it's worth it to experience.","Jan 14, 2018 at 5:53 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 19:27:53.904831,Frog_Jacuzzi,"Beautiful, lovingly crafted & unique","Indescribable description goes here. You'll simply have to try it :) I use this to demo VR to people, but I like to go in myself too from time to time.","Oct 27, 2017 at 11:40 PM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 19:27:53.947717,nightcat.mau,Van Gogh!,"A beautiful VR experience, just having the abilitry to explore the painted cafe would have been enough, but watching Van Gogh move and interact with his world was an amazing experience.","Sep 2, 2017 at 9:51 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:27:57.044434,neuro27,Excellent Quick Experience,"As a one-off experience, it is something very special indeed. To be able to jump into the paintings and maybe see the world through his own eyes might sound like an off app to create. But yet, somehow it works and you end up with one of the most beautiful art apps ever made. Van Gogh is a great choice for a VR app art style. Take a moment to enjoy his iconic sunflowers in 3 dimensions or walk around the chair he painted in his bedroom to see it from another angle. Step into the vivid colors straight from his palette of this impressionist world.","May 21, 2017 at 12:41 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:27:57.059395,Azazel08,Phenomenal!,"Positional tracking allows me to walk out into the patio, take a seat, and stare at the night sky while listening to the piano. absolutely marvelous!
