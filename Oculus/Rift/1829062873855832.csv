2022-05-28 19:25:31.169597,VibrationsOfDoom,Quite a nice little game...,"I enjoy this. You get a shield and a gun... Shooting down the space insects that attack you, and they can come from behind you as well! Three different modes of play, one is a ""pacifist"" mode where you swat away the critters with your dual shields (where is the fun in that tho! Actually, it IS quite fun). One is a wave shooter and one is a strategist game involving grabbing eggs and placing them in flowers; whch NEVER works right for me no matter how I orient the screen, I can't seem to reach the stash of eggs... Roomscale will probably make this null and void but I do have a rather spacious room setup... Make the eggs closer to the player or have some sort of ""magnetic grip,"" I dunno... Still a nice game.","Mar 18, 2019 at 10:28 AM",3, 3,"Hello, Thank you for sharing your thoughts about the game, Just released a new update which should enhance grabbing eggs from the stash for small room scale setup. hope you give it another try and see if it's fixed for you or you still have a problem with it. 
You can always contact me on FB page or steam discussion section since the game is out there too and it supports Oculus in case you face any problem with the game.

Thanks"

It is very reminiscent of  the early arcade games and can suck you into the same time warps as they did, I first fired it up to have a quick look as I had to go out, removed the Rift and an hour had gone by...whoops.
I have only played single player mode so can't comment on multiplayer.","Jan 24, 2019 at 10:50 AM",4, 13,I'm glad you guys enjoyed the game!
