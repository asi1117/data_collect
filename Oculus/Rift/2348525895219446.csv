2022-05-28 19:30:34.873643,StalinsFist,Good idea but needs work,It's a fun game. However one of my gripes with it is the hellcat. The Hellcat could out perform the zero (in Speed and power). So while I think it's fun I think the hellcat should have a better climb rate,"Oct 23, 2020 at 8:46 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 19:30:34.888603,NiCiStHeK,A great game!,"This game is almost all my hopes and dreams realized. I have always wanted to be able to fly old war birds (Specifically the F6F) and this game delivered. It can be challenging but not too challenging either. It does, however, lack a bit in the variety department. A few more playable planes or at least a new map would make this game even better than it already is!","Feb 21, 2020 at 6:46 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 19:30:34.903563,ktaylor2,It worked......once.,"It worked the first time after I purchased it, and it actuallly looked pretty decent. Now it only works up to the point where I select a campaign or quickplay. At that point the screen turns black and nothing ever happens. The game won't start. I'd give it 4 stars if it still worked. I did not purchase it anticipating to only play it once. If this is how it's gonna be, it's not worth it.



Update: I got it to work again twice, but campaign won't start consistently. I do like this app but it has some stability issues. I upped my rating to 3 stars, I'd give it 4 if it would run consistently. Maybe the developers can fix this? I can tell they've put a lot of work into this, and I realize this is still early access, so I hope they can fix this glitch. I wish them the best! I will increase my rating if they can make this more stable.

Since the update it seems stable now. The campaigns start when I select them. It's very challenging trying to shoot down enemy planes. Overall I like this game and recommend it.","Feb 18, 2020 at 10:41 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:30:34.918523,808Exile,"Not bad, good concept just needs work","This is a good effort and when they get the controls sorted it has the potential to be a good game. It's definitely worth spending a little money to support the effort. The outside environment is a little too cartoonish for my taste, but the cockpit looks great. I would suggest that they provide support for an external flight stick as well as the touch controllers. I Also suggest they take a look at Overflight for the Gear VR for some additional ideas.","Jan 6, 2020 at 6:34 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 19:30:34.933484,Ghost9115,Good game but needs work,Everything in this game is great except for the AI's and tutorial. The main part of the game is to dog fight other planes however from my experience you cant even get close to them and they go way faster than you even at full speed. They do menuvers that you the player cant do yourself. Shooting targets on the ground is a breeze and the flying is pretty good. Also there are a lot of switches and levers in the cockpit that need explaining in the tutorial.,"Jan 19, 2020 at 2:37 PM",3, 0,
