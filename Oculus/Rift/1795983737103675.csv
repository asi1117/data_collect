2022-05-28 17:33:17.205515,R3dplanet,DO NOT MAKE IN GAME PURCHASES (RIGGED),"Edited Review:  Originally I gave this 3 stars because of after a day of playing I felt were minor issues.

I'm editing this because after playing awhile now and listening to others and testing it myself they have this game rigged.

Multiple factors such as play time, willingness to pay for chips with cash, and such are quite blantantly used to adjust gameplay and luck.

Example I can give is when I first started it was like I couldn't lose while low level as if I was being given nice hands to so I can level up and I'd stick around for more than a day.

After a while of leveling it seemed stuffed kind of balanced out.  I'm not one of those that blame bad luck on consiprarcies.  I've played poker a long time and know sometimes it's just bad luck.  Everyone has dry spells.

It started to really show when I first purchased chips.  Not a lot just the $5 purchase.  Immediately after buying chips I lost a lot on my very first hand to what you would call a bad beat. Bad luck right?

Well I slowly lost them all because I was playing conservative since I now couldn't catch a single hand and bought another $5 package.  Once again, my very first hand after purchasing I lose almost all of the chips to another bad beat style hand.  Bad luck.. again?

I tested this two more times and noticed that every single time I purchased chips I would either right away or within 2-5 hands get another hand that is the ""nuts"" on the flop but would suddenly get busted on the river costing me almost everything to all ins or just large pots.

I'll play the game to chat with people I've met, but wanted to warn others... DO NOT PURCHASE CHIPS FROM THIS GAME.  Once you show you are willing to purchase chips you will suddenly get horrible hands.

Take this review as you want, a tilted player or someone cying he lost.  That's completely up to you.  I'm not saying don't play.... I'm saying don't spend any money.","Sep 4, 2018 at 9:09 AM",1, 21,"The poker algorithm is completely random with the same probabilities as in real life. Randomness means that bad luck and coincidences happen. The card algorithm is not influenced by in-app-purchases nor anything else.
What is more, Oculus does test the games on their platform rigorously and would never allow something like this, so be assured the game algorithm is fine"

If you're a fan of poker and love chatting, this is a great game for you. Almost everyone I've met so far are super cool to talk to. You most likely won't find any kids on this game which is a plus for me. Great game. I just wish there was some kind of in-game clock or that your watch tells you the time, so I won't have to take off my headset to check. Also, everytime I DO take off my headset, my connection is lost even if I'm not at a table and I would have to restart the game.","Jul 24, 2018 at 5:24 AM",5, 7,Thanks for the review!

2022-05-28 17:33:23.526608,Walkerian,Greatest Poker Game Ever,"This app is the greatest Poker game I have ever played on any platform. The realism is amazing. I have had no problems logging in and playing a game even with my very slow internet. The game runs great. The only thing I could say is maybe make the card animations a slight bit faster when revealing the winner of the game and have a few more Copper tables please. Those fill up fast.
      This game has quickly become one of my most played VR games. It is simply fantastic. All those who have trouble with the game should try it again or get help before leaving a horrible review after one failed attempt at logging in. It took me three attempts to log in the first time, but that was my internet and not the actual game. 
     I especially love the sometimes hilarious dev responses to stupid reviews. You developers are great. Keep up the good work!","Jul 28, 2018 at 1:43 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 17:33:23.542565,YoeyYutch,First impression - ok,"It was kind of cool. Kind of awkward. I just wanted to quick point out some things that I think could be improved. 

I was a little bit confused about the start times for the tournaments. There were no time zones listed. An in-game clock would be nice. Maybe time zone settings.

Need graphics settings. All VR games should have some graphics settings 

Choosing my bet size felt awkward because you have to stay perfectly still while pushing the button to choose your bet amount 

The community cards are hard to see. I like that they do float above the table and face directly at me for a moment but I can barely read them when they are laying on the table. A heads up display would be nice. Taller chairs maybe?

Why no dealer? The dealer provides important cues and information to keep the game running smoothly. Whose turn is it?  The dealer usually looks at you when its your turn They annouce bets and other table action. They may announce the community cards when they turn them etc.","Aug 19, 2018 at 9:46 AM",3, 0,Thanks for the detailed feedback. The tournament times are always displayed of your time zone.

Much more demanding sceneries, including Robo Recall or Dead and Buried are rendered smoothly on this PC, but not PokerVR.
At this point I can't even pick a table, the lag between the controller and display is so huge.
I'm only not giving it a 1 because of the promising stuff I've seen in the tutorial run.
BTW, there is an illusion of avatar cutomization, but it's really a single body with tiny tweaks. Would be much better with Oculus Avatar integration.","Jul 27, 2018 at 6:12 PM",2, 0,"A lag indicates something with your internet connection, it's not a general issue.
