2022-05-28 18:28:23.599611,Kristin525,Well worth the price!,"This is a short experience, but it also doesn't cost much. It's a really clever way to make art come to life. Great app for showing off what VR can do.","Apr 26, 2021 at 3:40 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:28:23.614570,Lowbill,Engaging look at classic paintings,"I purchased this on sale, not expecting it to live up to the great reviews, but it did.

Everything about this program is excellent. The only real improvement, as others have stated, would be to add more paintings.

Highly recommended.","Dec 26, 2020 at 12:51 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:28:23.629530,DelapierceD,"Very Short, Worth It On Sale!",Fun to jump into! I hope they add more! Engaging way to relate to the paintings,"Jan 9, 2021 at 10:45 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:28:23.643493,hackerJack241,I need more!,This is the most stunning experience I've had since I bought my Oculus Rift S. I hope there is opportunity to have even more artwork to explore. Mind-blowingly beautiful.,"Sep 21, 2020 at 10:45 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:28:23.658453,Thunderfury,Wonderful,"I love this program, can we please have a paid one with alot more arts plz.","Aug 31, 2020 at 12:32 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:28:26.765144,MisjaKlomp,A new dimension to art,"This is one of the experiences that made me decide to get a headset and it did not disappoint. It is short and a mostly passive experience, but an absolutely wonderful one. If you have at least a mild interest in art, I'm sure you'll find it just as wonderful as me to be able to experience the developer's interpretation of these masterpieces in a new dimension. I only wish there were more paintings to enjoy, but even as is, I would have paid more for the experience!","Jul 26, 2020 at 4:45 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:28:26.779107,cestomano,Very good experience (but short),"The idea is great and the quality is very good, good textures, good design and atmosphere. Very pleasant experience to relax or to introduce friends.
On the downside, maybe a little short (and not too cheap)... It would be great if they'll expande with more pictures.","May 28, 2020 at 6:00 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:28:26.794066,Famorii,Mesmeric,"Absolutely beautiful experience.  It opens the moment captured in the mind of ancient masters to reveal a living exploration of beauty.  Oddly, it relaxes me in the extreme.  Transportive and meditative, even soporific in a delightful way.  I just wish my goggles didn't get so uncomfortable when I drift away for a time.","May 10, 2020 at 11:14 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:28:26.809026,GoFlyUTR,Amazing!  More please,"I can't say enough about how cool it is to enter into these paintings as if you are there.  After sitting with the Mona Lisa while she turns her head to look at you ... well, I'll never look at that artwork the same way again.  Although there are only five paintings, it's well worth the small price if you love art.

I would GLADLY continue to pay $1.99 for five more paintings of this level of quality.  Please add an in-experience DLC that allows more content.  This is amazing!

Kudos to the development team.  A+ effort on this experience.  This is the kind of thing that VR was invented to do.","Feb 16, 2020 at 10:52 AM",5, 30,
2022-05-28 18:28:26.822989,TeacherAuthor,Not bad,It was pretty nice. The only way it could be better would be to allow the viewer to venture further into the painting. There is an experience on one of the video apps which carries the viewer through Van Gogh's Starry Night. This app only allows you to stand at the perimeter.,"May 3, 2020 at 6:09 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:28:29.928682,Floydian1,Simply Amazing!,"I'm fairly new to the universe of VR, so I'm fairly wowed easily. BUT, this was just amazing to experience, especially for the price. To be pulled into the actual time in history is very cool. To see Leo's sketchings on the table and one of his ""Flying Machines"" in the next room WOW! The little touches were amazing too.  In a painting, when you look behind you, the feeling is eerie and surreal when you can see the actual portal you were pulled through. I can't say enough about this fun, and yet astonishing VR experience. For the developers, I'd love to speak with you on more ideas for your gallery. Please MORE, MORE!!!!  Could you imagine being pulled into a Dali' or a Rene' Margritte? Or how about some more Da' Vinci, and Michelangelo? Seriously, the possiblilities are endless. I would definitely pay more for these add ons to your gallery!  Many thanks!  This is, by far, my favorite in my new VR journey.","Mar 31, 2020 at 10:24 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:28:29.943642,andyphillips99,Intellectual VR,"This experience may be small - but it's MIGHTY.  If you appreciate art on any level, you'll absolutely be glad you tried this experience.  Top tip:  Have some music playing before you actually open it, I suggest ""prelude to the afternoon of the faun""  by Debussy.  A glass of wine couldn't hurt either!

To the devs: This is the most underrated VR experience out there - would love to see more!  Some Caravaggio for the win.","Feb 25, 2020 at 3:10 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 18:28:29.979546,jere.karppinen,Awesome!,"This is the most awesome and relaxing piece of work I've seen in ages. I felt like I was time travelling, especially in the first painting ""Girl Reading a Letter"" where you can look out the window and see the scenery. Also Mona Lisa was beautiful and creepy at the same time. I will pay for more.","Feb 8, 2020 at 7:44 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:28:29.998496,Machiventa,Great depictions,"The 3d, depth, and scale are extremely well done.  My favorite is the goddess Venus.  The plants, trees, and floating flowers have depth to them as well as the subjects.  It just feels so dreamy.  The wind or audio also adds to the presence. I do wish however that the developers allowed for more range of movement.  You only have about a couple steps in each direction before the image fades out.  I'm sure these were programmed as 3d models so it is possible to walk all around them.  Please allow this option for more angles to appreciate the art.  I hope more artwork will be added!","Jan 31, 2020 at 5:02 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:28:30.013456,Cthulu-Hoops,Superb modelling.,"For a couple of quid, I took a gamble that these were actual modelled environments rather than pre-rendered environments, and boom! they are so we have full 6 degrees of freedom. The guys who did the 3D modelling for these did a stunning job too.  Especially Jan Vermeers A Woman Reading a Letter. Looking out the window to 'view of delft' was a great touch, and made it all very real. Love the tongue in cheek play on the old phrase 'Mona Lisas gaze follows' you around the room. Only a little thing, but they did a great job and it was the right price for 10 minutes of inspiration.","May 17, 2020 at 9:35 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:28:33.113165,Epiphany47,This is the coolest most creative idea,I hope there will be additions to this soon! Such a creative mind to think of something like this!,"Mar 9, 2020 at 12:17 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:28:33.127128,Lamikar,Please make more :),"though the whole experience lasted maybe 15 mins at most, the idea of being able to be inside these famous and quite beautiful painting is amazing. I can imagine who idea like this could be used in art classes and in actual museums as well. Please developers, make more!! :D","Jan 29, 2020 at 9:41 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:28:33.141091,NotaHumanResource,Great for Art lovers,Neat experience and priced right.  Good one to show people new to VR.  Would love to see it expanded to include more movement within the piece and include more art pieces.,"Feb 9, 2020 at 3:27 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 18:28:33.156050,fabiobrasiliense,"Awesome Experience, Anoying message","Great experience, a little disturbing, expecially with the Mona Lisa looking at you. Simple and intuitive. But there is a very anoying message that keeps poping up if I stare the painting for too long. I think there is no need of such message, the app is simple enough. Let me see the paintings! :)","Apr 21, 2020 at 9:14 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:28:33.170013,DaCruzi,Really beautiful and impressive,"This is truly magic, to get the feeling of being inside thoses paintings is incredible. Give us more, like others i'm willing to pay for in app purchase without problem.

You guys are genius ( both of you devs ) and this game is a steal and a must have if you love art.","Apr 22, 2020 at 1:41 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 18:28:36.284682,BartKut,Beautiful  and inspiring!,"Fantastic VR experience. Love attention to details and how extended 3 dimmentional space inside the painting perfectly matching feel and style of the particulaor artwork. This app is a great example where VR technology shines, allowing you to experience impossible. Congratulations to developers and cratives who worked and perfectly executed this idea. I keep coming back to this app finding out more and more details and calming myself dawn. I am suggesting to extend gallery for small fee ( I will be happy to pay extra ) including work of  impressionists  ( Monet maybe  ) , surrealists ( Salvador Dali, Frida ) and maybe little bit on the dark side of expressionism ( Munch )  and someching between F. Bacon ? 
Definately recomending this app!","Dec 25, 2019 at 1:29 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 18:28:39.485123,BugLord,I want more!,This is a great concept and really well executed. I keep going back and just sitting in some of the environments just to look around and relax.

2022-05-28 18:28:42.586827,absentmindedness,Worth upgrading to the Rift version,"I already have this for the Oculus Go and wondered if this version would be exactly the same, but, for the record, it DOES have 6-dof head movement, making everything a lot more 'present' and, frankly, massively relaxing - my favourite scene for that reason being the Vermeer. You are confined, of course, to a small area in which to move and if you go beyond that, everything turns into glowing cubes, which works well. 100% worth the money and I really want to see more paintings added","Sep 6, 2019 at 6:35 PM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 18:28:42.602784,EddieNanakase,Fantastic art immersion !,"Very immersive interpretation of the paintings !  It feels like you are the artist about to create these pieces of fine art !  My favorite painting is the Mona Lisa, it's so freaky and impressive seeing her eyes and head following your head movement .  The way she looks away and reconnects with your eyes again while moving her eyebrows  really makes this work of art very immersive !  It really does make you feel like you have her in front of you !  !  For the price, this is a must for your collection .","Sep 9, 2019 at 3:27 PM",5, 11,

2022-05-28 18:28:42.631706,ikonaut,Exceptional little gem,"The idea of diving into big works of art is genius, the execution flawless. It's short of course but no doubt it's worth its price.
The only small criticism I have; please don't move the camera into the paintings, this will make some people sick extremely fast. Maybe have a black maquette during movement or at least make it an option.","Sep 24, 2019 at 3:35 AM",5, 7,

2022-05-28 18:28:45.791256,Conejeros,Great demo,"This is a great demonstration of something amazing, off course, it needs many more paintings to make it into a full experience, but for now it´s a great and inexpensive demo. And it will be great to show off when they make it available for the Quest. 
The effect is very well done and the art work is for the most part amazing, evocative, beautiful and accurate. Except... come on... Jupiter?. Beautifuly done that one, but they went way too far. It´s tacky and amateur (none should get that artistic licence).","Sep 17, 2019 at 6:17 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 18:28:48.925872,Przemo-c,Just plainly AWESOME!,"It's a really well done VR interpretation of couple of paintings. It's not over the top. It hits the right balace. It feels like what those paintings would be if author would do them in VR to begin with.

I know some people use nature sceneries to relax/meditate. But just going into one of those paintings. Seeing that detailed beauty with a gentle animation/soundscape. It's relaxing, mesmerising and plainly beautifull.

And at that price it's a steal!","Sep 4, 2019 at 3:48 PM",5, 5,
