Overall, this is a puzzle-ish game with a surprising amount of physical interaction and movement required.   Each of the three ""time zones"" contains four puzzles, seperated into four categories.  The puzzles in each fit their respective category quite well, and can be quite a bit more challenging than you would think, though obviously this will vary from one person to the next.  The math one for instance I totally suck at, but maybe you'll find it easier.

The mental & mystery type puzzles are fairly calm experiences despite their time limit, while the skill & physical ones can be tiring.  The physical ones most of all... they'll have you waving your arms around like a maniac as you attempt to complete your goal, and yeah, it can really wear you out.  But it'll be a great time regardless.  Fortunately, you can exit between these and the game will save your place in the run, so if you get too worn out, you can take a break and come back later.

The one event that I found to be problematic was the target shooting one.  The gun's orientation doesnt ""lock"" automatically like it does in pretty much every other shooter, instead it's orientation is purely based on the angle you grip it at.  This should probably be changed, as right now it's very frustrating to get a grip on it in such a way where accuracy is actually possible.

Due to too many dog-related interruptions while trying to use the headset today, I have not gotten to try every single event in the game as of this review, but I'll be getting to them soon enough.  I expect they'll be just as fun as the ones I've already done.

The crystal grabbing one that you do at the end is my favorite though.","Feb 26, 2019 at 8:43 AM",4, 4,"Thank you for the review. I'm really pleased you are enjoying the game. I'm very happy with the fact you see a clear distinction between puzzle types as that was really important to me.

In regards to the target shooting, I had originally intended for the pick up action on the gun to be part of the ""skill"" of the puzzle, but given your review I've decided you are correct and updated the puzzle. The gun will now lock into place when you pick it up. 

Glad you enjoy the final crystal grabbing, hope to see your name on the Crystal Leaderboard shortly :)"
