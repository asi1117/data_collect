2022-05-28 17:28:33.944618,Corelian,In love with this game already !,"As a long time fan of table top roleplaying games, using maps and minatures, and also a fan of the original Dungeon Keeper, I am completely smitten with this game.

If i could do anything to help I would, I truly hope they make lots more levels and other content for it as soon as possible.","Oct 29, 2020 at 12:46 PM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 17:28:33.978527,GodOfToast160,Amazing hope it'll come out soon!!,I like the concept and the tower defence feel. All I want for this game is more options like goblins caves or lava fountains more crazy units. maybe like superunits like a mecha goblin or a bigger lava golem. There just not a whole lot of protect your dungeon games like dungeon keeper or war for the overworld. I will be waiting any chance I can get a date of release by any chance?,"Jul 7, 2019 at 5:21 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 17:28:34.007450,mindcola,Yet another abandoned Early Access Game,"It hasn't been updated since Mar 2018.  The devs have stopped responding to threads on their Steam game discussion board.  The entire industry should really call it Unfinished Games, instead of Early Access.  Meh.

The game itself has high production quality and isn't really the ""VR Dungeon Keeper"" game I was hoping it would be.  If you get it, spend $2 at most as it doesn't look like it'll be updated and it's quite short.  It's more a demo than anything else, tbh.","Jan 27, 2019 at 7:02 AM",2, 43,
2022-05-28 17:28:37.149048,GreatBoo,"Good, but with a couple minor problems.","There were just two issues I found cumbersome. First, touching the rings to switch between traps and units was awkward and the controllers often bumped together. Second, holding my hand palm up the whole time made it ache after a while -- perhaps a vertical hand position (holding the controls rather than having them on the palm) would work better. Also, I would like to see a game mode where there is no end and the waves just continue to get harder where the point is to see how many waves you can withstand.

Other than that, I enjoyed playing the game and the graphics were nice. I did not find the breaking of barrels as cumbersome as other review have said and I found the movement to be fine.","Oct 9, 2018 at 8:41 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 17:28:37.164008,Ayatoldya_muckhuck,3 levels?,"Game could be good but are there only 3 levels?? Found it very easy..also have to crawl around with your hands, there should be continuation of movement when you release the button like brass tactics, even though you can zoom right out and see most of the map anyway. Shouldn't this be in early access section if only 3 levels?","Apr 16, 2018 at 2:29 PM",2, 7,"Thanks for your feedback! It is meant as early access, yes, as described in the text. We also submitted it in the early access category. Not sure why it is not shown there."
2022-05-28 17:28:37.178968,3DeMan,,"This is a neat little title, and priced just right (I think - as I have not had time to expore how much content there is). 
I really like these little diorama games in VR and I have a soft spot for tower defence games. 
So why not more stars? Well, it is a poor choixe to release this the same week as Brass Tactics (which *is* a 5 star game, and realy shows how these things should be done). But this does not mean this title is a bad game, it has its own charm and is a solid title.
The big problem for me, and it is problem that stops me going back into it - is a certain game mechanic. To get power to build items and troops, you have to smash barrels and other items scattered around the level. I can see why the devs thought this was a good idea - picking up these little things is fun in VR. However, it also breaks the game, as you have to divert your attention from where it is needed. So I have a battle going and need to possition my troops, lay traps and manage the situation - but I am running out of power, so I have to leave the actual focus of the game to smash more ***** barrels, then come back latter to see my troops decimated. (As someone else said), the game is frantic and difficult - and it is just because of this mechanic IMO. Devs, please fix this so I have incentive to play again. It can still be fun to pick items up to lob at and stun the enemy - lets get power in the more traditional way (from killing the enemy). Fix this for an extra star andf a recommendation. 
Still worth the cash, if this is your sort of game - but I cannot dispell the idea that which a little more polish, content and a look at gameplay, there is  a good game waiting to break out.","Feb 26, 2018 at 3:06 AM",3, 5,Thanks for your indepth review! Since this part of the game was also discussed heavily during development we realize that the user feedback for now suggests that we should change/improve that game mechanic. We will think of what can be done to make the game probably less frantic but more fun to play.
2022-05-28 17:28:37.193928,M1cH3LL,"its fun, but very hectic right now","I would enjoy this game more if the easy difficulty would be more easier, right now its pretty hectic and frustrating.  The balancing is not right. It looks great and is a can be a nice Dungeon Defence Game, but way to fast to enjoy the environment and fights.","Feb 23, 2018 at 10:27 PM",3, 1,Thanks for your feedback! We are collecting user feedback and might change the balancing to give it a slower pace in the future.
