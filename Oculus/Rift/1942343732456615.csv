2022-05-28 13:20:28.764199,ATeamAmerica,Excellent but short and not cross buy,"Like others, I'm incredibly annoyed that this isn't cross buy. VR games are very short for the most part so the 30 price tag is tough but I want to support the industry so I paid it. There's absolutely no reason why I should have to pay again to be able to show your product to friends when I can't take my whole pc to their house. Really bad move in my opinion. Cross buy needs to be the standard. That's the only reason it losses stars. They made a great game.",3 days ago,3, 0,

How do I start a new game? The options button (3 lines) is supposed to open the game menu, but it really opens the Oculus quest 2 menu for me.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks a lot

Edit: 
Solved!!!

I had the options and oculus buttons swapped, I have disabled that option. The game menu is already opening",Dec 11 at 5:17 PM,5, 0,

I replaced my Rift with a new Quest 2. it is mental to think someone is going to repurchase your app for a newer hardware, but same system (Facebook). I refuse to purchase it again due to newer version of the quest 2 I have. I would like my purchase moved to my lol same Facebook account under my quest 2.

2022-05-28 13:20:31.927436,Paxdeus,A MUST have. Absolutely must play.,"The word ""care"" comes to mind when I thought about how to describe this game. The developers took a lot of time , effort, and care into putting together an experience that will make you feel invested and attached to the little mouse girl Qull. Even though you are controlling her, you tend to think of this as a guided adventure where you guide her to the next challenge. You feel like you're a protector of sorts. It's a different perspective and I applaud the developers for putting the effort to the story, the brillian visuals of the world that you can literally feel a part of.I enjoyed it so much and I will play it again to get all the secrets I missed. 5/5 gameplay is phenominal and the puzzles are challenging and satisfying to finish. It doesn't hold your hand, you have to think for yourself and use the skills and equipment that you have gotten to solve the puzzles as they progressively demand more out of you as the guardian and fighter on the ground. I love this game. I can't explaain it but this one is special.",Aug 24 at 1:46 PM,5, 7,

tl;dr - 5/5 instant classic

And to think, this is their first VR Game! They've earned an auto buy from me for their next experience. Buy this game if you're on the fence what experiences would entertain you, and especially if you're a console gamer driven by narrative and immersion taking a first dip into VR titles. Quill is as cute as she is brave, and YOU player are there to help her on her quest - moving obstacles, distracting enemies, etc.","Dec 30, 2020 at 9:38 AM",5, 23,

I thought the 3rd person view and weird camera angles would put me off but they work really well together and actually makes the game .

2022-05-28 13:20:38.297680,Steviewhitt,Phenominal,This game has to be the best VR platform/adventure game on the market.  The graphics are the best I've seen on a VR game and the attention to detail is amazing.  There is so much effort gone into developing the world in which little Quill operates in.  Just stopping what you are doing to admire the surroundings is bliss itself.  The puzzles are challenging at times but a lot of fun.

If you want play wireless with the Quest 2 get it from the app store on the Quest or ur phone.
Making us pay duble is BS! 
    This is a fail on Oculus part Its the same hardwear company why are you making us pay for getting one device over another ? if this is not part of the same eco system then make it clear that its not .
   Also Shame on this team for not making this game cross-play, it's also your choice to do so or not. when you have the game on sale in store front but not the other for the same company that is BS!

2022-05-28 13:20:38.328598,StormyHowls,What an incredible adventure!,"I beat the game in 2-4 days and I think I racked up 10 hours. I only had to look up a let's play for the very beginning when I didn't realize that Quill could edge and shimmy across. I've been into audio books lately so the fact the characters were all voiced by one person didn't jar me too much. 
Honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of controls, as I wasn't sure if I had to command and communicate with Quill and she may have been a free thinking AI, but basically Moss is a platformer adventure where she is nimble like Ammy from Okami but also has Zelda like puzzles, without the blocks. She doesn't have many tools, or rather, you are her tool. She relies on you to make miricles happen, but at the same time, there are only certain things that you can influence. 
The puzzles are a bit challenging, but they are not 'water temple' hard. Sometimes the combat is a puzzle too. I found that if the game keeps spawning adds continuously, I was doing something incorrectly and needed to do something different. Then I was suddenly able to progress. It was how I could tell if the game wanted to me 'kill everything' or 'trigger something'.  
She seems to try to talk to you in sign language and provides hints through charades. However these hints are not overly done which is nice but at the same time feels like she's working with you on what she thinks needs to happen. 
The graphics are amazing. I'm glad I bought the PC version for my quest2. I felt the length of play was good enough, wasn't too hard and was good at communicating to me as to what was expected of me. I'm really looking forward for the next game and I hope the combat gets even harder. Thanks!","Nov 2, 2020 at 6:32 AM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 13:20:41.433919,Hrovotnir,An emotionally captivating masterpiece.,"Honestly, since the first moment i set my eyes upon this game, i was captivated, it's beauty is one of those things that can't really be put into words, but as i believe that everyone should play this game, i will give it a try.

The Controls are fluid and fun, the Vr aspects are masterfully tailored for the seated experience, and the main character quill aside from being a mouse quickly became a quick favorite in my opion out of all the games i've played in my 21 years of life, the story while being a relatively simple tale of a mouse trying to save her uncle has by no means unfulfilling it's quite the opposite.

the moment the book closes and you've reached the end you yearn for more, and personally? if moss 2 ever happens, nothing is going to stop me from buying it, Polyarc while being relatively young in the grand scheme of things have nailed their first title, and i will be personally following them closely over the coming years.","Nov 20, 2020 at 7:38 PM",5, 4,

It is an absolutely stunning looking puzzle platformer with strong mechanics, atmospheric audio design and an endearing little charactor, the level of effort and polish that has gone into this game makes it well worth a playthrough!","Nov 16, 2020 at 7:13 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 13:20:47.788609,4ever_Young,The most beautiful and immersive VR game,"This tittle is worth every penny. The 5 stars reviews are legit. The attention to detail is amazing. You will have to solve puzzles as well as fight enemies. I have seen many lists on the internet about ""best VR games"" and this title almost never makes it to the lists and if ti does it often at the bottom of those lists. The only explanation I can come up with is that most of those lists are written by men who can only find pleasure shooting at things. While a lot of those titles have good gameplay they are not anywhere as beautiful or more importantly as immersive as Moss is. This game is designed to primarily be played seated but I encourage you to occasionally stand up and look around. Standing up occasionally will give you a much better understaning of the layout. It never requires you to physically walk around. It is super comfortable to play. You can finish this game in 2-3 days but you are in for a visual treat like you have never experienced before. Get this game before you buy anything else. You will no regret it. I personally enjoyed leaning forward and looking around as all of the scenes are beautiful. Also it really looks 3D in a very realistic and magical way. The screenshots dont do it justice as they are 2D and flat. This game is anything but flat.","Jul 27, 2020 at 1:31 AM",5, 39,

It is absolutely worth the 19 euro I paid. I just hope the developers make a sequel that is not as linear. More enemies and variation.

In terms of graphics, detail, immersion, and comfort, this is the best VR game I've played so far.  It's a 4th wall breaking action platformer/puzzle game where you take the role of a giant (in comparison to mice, at least), semi-invisible entity called a ""Reader"", but you also control the main character in the story (a mouse).  The animation is flawless and each level is incredibly detailed and gorgeous.  There are items hidden throughout the levels and sometimes you (the ""Reader"") will have to look around walls and statues to find them, but other than that this game can be played comfortably in a chair.  Not much space required to move at all.  You will get lost in this game and lose track of all time.","Aug 2, 2020 at 12:56 PM",5, 2,

The settings take you from a forest to old ruins, to a secret garden, a cave, and finally to a castle, all beautifully done. I spent a lot of time appreciating the world and I love how you can peer around corners, inside buildings, and even get up to see how this miniature world fits into a forest with full sized-trees and deer in the background.  This will be a game I will demo to those new to vr to see the marvel of vr 3rd person games. 

After appreciating the visuals, focus shifts to the puzzles, which require some thinking to solve. Just when I thought I was stuck, Id figure out how to solve it and feel a sense of achievement. But I'm trying to go slow to take my time finishing it. The attention to detail in the graphics and level design is second to none. Sometimes I notice that each leaf was in 3d, and even the background elements had a parallax effect. The game  feels magical and had me saying ""wow"" many times.

(though Lone Echo is also really good, and that Lovecraftian game ""Edge of Nowhere""), but this is the perfect VR adventure game! I have an affinity for anthropomorphic creatures, so it was easy to lure me in, but the game is so incredibly good. So lovingly crafted. Every single aspect of this game is beautiful. The animation, the controls, the fighting (Quill has some awesome moves with her sword), the music!

While the game is shorter than expected and took only about 3.5+ hours to beat, I still have to recommend this game to everyone. Every area in the game is memorable and themed really well with whatever the current chapter may be. The combat is easy to grasp (dodging and knowing when to attack) and the movement works well.

The game overall isn't difficult to the point were you would pull your hair out with the hardest part being the boss for the included DLC which I died about 10 times to but never got frustrating given the forgiving checkpoints. The puzzles aren't too difficult but once you reach the later levels they do get much more difficult but never to the point where I wanted to search up the answer. The game ran smoothly even with just a GTX 1060 with loading times between levels only taking up to 2 to 20 seconds. would recommend it to everyone that's looking for a great, linear, puzzle, adventure, combat, VR 3rd person platformer, story game.

It was worth the money, and worth supporting a company that is making some real inroads in VR gaming.  My only complaint was that the use of the book to tell the story inbetween game segments was slow and nowhere near as engaging as actual gameplay.  Although obviously more expensive to make, I would have much preferred naration over top of the story being told in the game space, and not in the reader space.

Like most VR games, it is short. Even collecting all of the collectibles didn't take long, but it had me going back through the levels trying to find the secrets. Some levels required a little bit of physical looking around which made the game feel even bigger.

Update: The Twilight Garden is added and gives even more awesomeness to the story. The portals, three of them, to the Twilight garden are through other chapters.

I thought that the VR will be good only in first person but this game showed me that the third person have a lot of posibilities too.

The graphics are amazing with a lot of fantasy like in a fairy tale.
The relation between Quill (the little mouse) and you like ""the reader"" is so lovely and have a moments epics too.

The music form Jason Graves are fantastic too. It's a great musician.
All the features, art, music...  of the game are done with love and pasion.

For Polyarc:

I think that you are doing a second part of Moss.
Thi are my suggestions or improvements with all my respects:

- More equipement for Quill with different weapons to choose.
- More scenaries where you can choose different roads to arrive to the end with a 
   map. (This will do the game more longer and funny to play again with different 
   roads)
  
This is my opinion and if you do a game more longer I will pay the double or more for a game like this for sure.

That said, having subtitles at all is so much better than having no subtitles!   Many VR games, including big studios (Industrial Light & Magic / Lucasfilm / Disney) stilll omit subtitles from even big titles such as Star Wars.  But not you; you included subtitles and for that is an automatic 5-star from me.

Also, some people informed me that a group at Gallaudet University (a deaf university in Maryland) is considering a lawsuit to Oculus to force better disclosure of which VR games has subtitles or not -- like ""Subtitles: Yes"" versus ""Subtitles: No"".   Many accidental purchases of VR games and dissapointments have occured.  Steam has better disclosure but Oculus has a lot of great content.","Feb 8, 2020 at 11:16 AM",5, 3,

Negatives: the game in my opinion is spoilt by its difficulty curve later on, hermit crab & entrance to the castle, the difficulty of these fights ramp up, the hermit crab a strategy is needed which is not obvious, the hermit crab boss is almost as large as the central platform, meaning you are more prone to falling off in this fight and dying that way an ignoble death, the move set you set have which is the darting attack seems to make you more prone to falling of platforms somehow worse than the prior spin attack, charging up the sword mid fight? it feels there is no time. I think this game tries to ride a line between puzzles & combat which often overwhelms, & build agreived frustration in the player, the solution for the latter hermit crab phase imo opinion is to go range from an outer platform and & move position to an opposing side of the little platform on each of his 3 volley launches if timed right his fireball always lands where you were when he launched it, then conduct two charge range attacks shots and repeat, some say his rear is more vulnerable not sure? but close up comabt is death, if you go wrong, you can heal in the down time at the end of his three volleys. At the gate to the castle the number of mobs coming and from various directions just made me switch it off, if they left the emphasis on the puzzles and made the combat fights not so aggregious it would be more bearable, too many units to handle at many points, with one hand controlling one enemy unit whilst controlling quil with the other, for people of a certain  age theres just too much to handle, a simple solution is to accept one difficulty curve is not suitable for all and have some difficulty modes, also the game isnt adaptive, so if you fail on a fight forty times in a row, the game doesnt not alter difficulty to let you pass to see later content.","Oct 14, 2019 at 9:06 AM",4, 6,

This game is amazing. I first played it on low graphics and was amazed by the experience, on high, well, its just great.

2022-05-28 13:21:47.918350,marc.s.jackson,Beautiful and Comfortable,"Moss shares similarites to lucky's tale however improves on it in every way. Having the camera stationary does wonders for those prone to motion sickness. With lucky's tale I'd have a friend try it and they would step away sick within a few moments. Staying stationary in Moss provides a better experience.

This game is beautiful. The scenes are detailed and all those details build up the world Moss takes place in. Those with a Rift S will get the most out of this game with it's extra clarity. Having the better screen just makes it easier to become immersed in the story.

The story is good. Considering most VR games don't even have a story that's an amazing accomplishment. Be warned the dialogue isn't always suburb and can be cringy at times but overall it adds much more than it takes away. The voice acting is similar in that a more varried cast of voices would benifit the game however what it does have is much better than nothing. 

Gameplay is good. Puzzles are varried and some take real thought. There are lots of different puzzle/combat elements to keep the player from getting bored.

I'm severely handicapped, and as a result I can only playing games that can be played Sitting, and even some Sitting games are unplayable for me. I can move my upper body freely, but I can't bend down or swivel around. Because of the nature of the puzzles in Moss, I was concerned that some objects might be out of reach.

Fortunately, I only ran into 2 places where I needed to be able to reach down beyond my range, and luckily in both cases I was able to hold the headset above my head and temporarily reset my view for those particular puzzles. It was a little frustrating (thus the 4-star rating, instead of 5-stars), but I was able to play the whole game and that's what really mattered.","Apr 9, 2019 at 12:46 AM",4, 44,
2022-05-28 13:21:51.058076,R3dplanet,30 minutes in...,"I'm about 30 minutes in and already ready for Moss 2 or another game like this.  So many people, including myself, think of VR and can only imagine a first person experience being of value.  That's understandable, it is virtual ""reality"", but once you remember it's meant for immersion not just another form of realism you find games like Moss.

Moss reminds me of Ori and the Blind Forest in the manner of story and beauty, but with Moss, I also get the immersive effect.  It's an oddly satisfying experience to be able to look around and see the environment around me even though it's a platformer game.  Or peek over the top of a branch and see some deer that I only would've seen if the developers had allowed it in that view.

That to me is what makes VR great, and I can't wait to see more.  What we consider ""nuggest"" or ""easter eggs"" in other games are just environment in VR games.  Give me games like this where I control a character as with any other game but the feeling of actually being there, overlooking, and the chance to peek around the corner and see something new.... or not see anything at all.

Is Moss the greatest game I've ever played... no, it is not.  But, I'm only 30 minutes in and can't wait to get 30 more.

[Why 4 stars you ask if I speak so highly of it.  That is purely because Moss, though nice so far, does have extremely minor things keeping it from 5 stars. And remember, it's possible some of these minor things may go away the further in I get.  If Moss had more girth to the game itself (the story so far is well done) such as abilities, xp, enchancements to get, it would've gained that 5th star.  So, if you are considering Moss, I say buy it.  I think you'll enjoy it.  If like me, the little things you wish it had that doesn't you know will come in time as games like this or developers like this expand.  I can't wait for Moss 2 or the next game like it.]

2022-05-28 13:22:13.256015,GrapesVR,,"It looks good. The controls are great and work well together. They made great choices for the art assets. The puzzles are at least interesting enough to keep you interested, and the platforming is fresh. 

My first playthrough was 2 hours 30 min. 

The narrator and book flipping segments take away from the wonderful world and character they made. Having someone speak for Quill is not necessary, as they did such a great job giving her a personality otherwise. Most of the game is really easy and then has a big spike at the end where it takes on an action platformer sort of a vibe.  I liked it but it was really out of left field. They also lean too much on combat that isn't great and is mostly just fast attack spamming. 

It's not bad at all, but it's also not the world's most amazing game as it seems to be heralded as. I am also looking forward to more and would buy a sequel. A solid 7 or 7.5 out of 10.

I haven't made a VR review until now, as I feel this game deserves it. I own and play various VR games from DCS World (combat flight simulator) to games like H3VR, Robo Recall, etc.; and this game is the best sit-down VR dedicated game I've played.

You'll get about 3 hours of gameplay out of Moss (slightly more or less depending on your play style) and while that may seem a bit short, keep in mind this game was developed from the ground up for VR. There's nothing in this game that suggest corners were cut. This game is absolutely POLISHED for VR - a AAA VR game if you will.  You can tell a lot of hardwork went into Moss; everything from the Graphics (using the Unreal Engine), to the music, the sounds, the story,  the gameplay, and voice acting. It's all just nearly perfect.

If you want to see what future lies ahead for VR sit-down casual gaming, $30 will get you that experience. If you're eyeballing Moss...just buy it. Seriously.","Jan 27, 2019 at 1:12 PM",5, 1,

Great game, Quill is so cute, couldn't hold myself to pet her once in a while. :) I'm not into puzzles games, but in this kind of environement and game play it'S brilliant. Not too hard, just fun enough. Though only one time did i quit the game, for a specific fight scene, the context of the game and fight system wasn'T meant for this and it's get heavy. But besides that, just great. 

The idea of being a reader is, on my own opinion just awesome. Reminds me of Alone Together but 2 times better as we can do some stuff as Quill also. Hoping for a Moss 2 :)

Sad thing is, i held myself back so long to grab it as i was waiting for it to get on specials as most games, since i buy lots of them. But it never did, so i couldn't wait to grab it full price, sad thing is, the day after i complete the game, it's on Daily Special today :P But i do not regret the full price i've paid.","Dec 24, 2018 at 8:08 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 13:22:32.265778,yellownumber5,Excellent VR platforming while it lasts.,"This game is short.  I finished it in under 4 hours.  However it is a good example of how to make effective and engaging platforming for VR by requiring you to physically interact with the environment while also controlling your character.  Being a seated experience is a nice break from more active VR games, and it sets the mood as a narrative-driven game that starts you out reading a story from a book.  Unlike other VR platformers that have the camera follow the character, Moss treats each room as it's own stage, uch like turning the pages in a pop-up book or viewing a set of dioramas.

When you finish the game you get an acheivement ""a good beginning"", which says a lot about how the game ends pretty quickly and leaves you wanting.  The ending felt like an introduction to a larger story and I expected it to keep going, but instead it ducked out and left me sitting alone in a cold library.  There is plenty of room where they can go with this style of platforming, and it feels like it doesn't live up to its potential.  It is obvious at the end that they plan on writing new chapters, but I wished they alluded to that from the beginning or in the title that this would be an episodic game.

There are also collectibles in the game that I have no idea what their purpose is.","Oct 22, 2018 at 7:20 AM",4, 2,

But after the “wow” factor fades, there are some issues with the gameplay, which is really the most important part of any game. There are some blind spots in some areas that can be annoying. The part I found most frustrating was how slow Quill is to respond to inputs. This is really noticeable in fights with swarms of enemies. I am trying to hit and dodge, and she is so slow to do either. You can help her in fights by holding down enemies while fighting with her, but this requires some very awkward hand placement with simultaneous finger inputs.
I don’t know how close I am to finishing, but this game seems really short for the price. I am willing to spend a little extra right now to encourage more studios to produce quality VR games. However, I think I would advise players to wait until this goes on sale before purchasing it.","Jul 2, 2018 at 12:33 AM",3, 10,

Everything about this game just screams quality, attention to detail and polish and so far it's my GOTY! This is going to take some beating!

What I found particularly interesting and clever was having the player control the protagonist, while not 'being' them exactly. Instead, you help Quill, take part in her journey along with her, and it develops a wonderful bond that wouldn't be there if you 'were' the protagonist, which is something that similar games like Chronos lacked. Being able to interact directly with the environment using my hands to help with puzzles was a great way of combining the appeal of console platformers with the unique capabilities of VR, building on what works rather than trying to reinvent the wheel. I also felt that using mice as characters was inspired, as it allowed for them and their world to be 'actual size' in a way that's not the case with scaled-down humans. Plus it was interesting seeing the worldbuilding, with them using squirrels instead of horses and such!

Minor issues: 
Static 'camera' position - would be nice to be able to grab the world with both hands and rotate the scene to get a better angle on some of the platforming, or just look closer at some of the scenery.  

Extremely linear - this does make some sense in the context of playing out actions in a book, I just wish it were closer to a choose-your-own-adventure with at least a few branching paths or alternate solutions to puzzles.

Short - There are obviously sequels planned, hopefully as somehat lower priced DLC.  If you're looking for more than a few hours of gameplay, maybe wait until more parts have been released.","Jun 10, 2018 at 2:30 AM",4, 9,

Moss may already be on my top 3 of best games ever made (at least within it's genre). It's not 5/5, it's probably 8/5 (compared to other 5/5 games except Lone Echo, of course). You control a mouse in 3rd person and you're in the gameworld in 1st person. Graphics are simply breathtakingly awesome, and although gameplay does remind you of Kin and possibly Chronos, Moss bows to no one. If you have a Rift headset, Moss is the game to get - when you're done with Lone Echo :-) Moss works perfectly forcing super-sampling 2.0 using an oc'ed GTX 1080.
Moss is played sitting down, but do stand up now and then to check you're not missing any secrets. Note, by default graphics are set to low when starting the game for the first time, remember to set graphics to high. The game isn't that taxing on current hardware, I wouldn't be surprised if GTX 1060 6GB owners can enable super-sampling 1.5 with high graphics setting and no frame dropping. This is probably the best VR game arriving in 2018 - and don't rush it, take your time to enjoy the world and find all the secrets, then this game may take 6 to 8 hours to complete.","Jul 21, 2018 at 4:07 AM",5, 1,

The game loses a lot when you have to be reading subtitles","Jun 8, 2018 at 4:04 AM",1, 9,"Thank you for your feedback. Our goal is to make Moss an accessible and enjoyable game for as many people as possible. Similar to the addition of subtitle and UI support for Spanish, Italian, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified) languages, and VO in Japanese, we will continue to evaluate and introduce additional localization support when we can. Spanish is an important language for us and that is why we took the first step in supporting Spanish with subtitle and UI support. We have also updated the game description to better communicate the level of localized support."
