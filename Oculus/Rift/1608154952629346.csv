Cons: The graphics are very basic, and the voice-acting is far from great.  The physics, collision, etc. is also lacking, as is the combat with the few enemies I encountered.  It has some RPG elements, but they are ""lite"".

Overall, this isn't a terrible game, but I can't really imagine recommending it over other options.  It comes across more as a hobby project than as a commercial product.","May 6, 2020 at 10:33 AM",2, 11,
