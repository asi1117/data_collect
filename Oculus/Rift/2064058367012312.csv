2022-05-28 19:13:49.395591,cavarlyman,Great space game,The best space game right now for me. Excellent battles between teams logged on to the server. It attracts attention for long hours. Excellent graphics and good maneuverability. Thanks to the developers. I hope it will be available for oculus quest as soon as possible (currently I using Oculus Link).,"Apr 21, 2020 at 1:49 AM",5, 1,"Thank you so much! You can find this game on Oculus GO and GearVR, cross-platform multiplayer is working"
2022-05-28 19:13:49.412546,beanz991,Wow what a great game,"This is about the best VR game I've tried so far, Installed it at 9pm and when I finished playing for the night I thought it was about 11pm...took my headset off and it was 1am! The best VR purchase I've made so far and at a super low price, I've paid 10x this for other games and not got a 10th of the value from them. 

Please think about adding voice chat to multiplayer and maybe a friends list.","Sep 19, 2019 at 4:04 AM",5, 3,"Thank you so much! We will add voice chat in next update, please stay with us and check it soon."

2022-05-28 19:13:49.443463,Jon_Ray,"Beautiful, dynamic! Want more!","Very cool! I think the app should be for early access, as it's clear that the developers haven't implemented much yet. The game has great capacity. 
I hope you will release the mobile version so that I can challenge my friends on the Oculus GO. I was pleased with a large map, I hope the developers will make more of these locations and add training (this item is in the menu, but it is not active), as the management of the first time is not clear. 
Cool mechanics and gameplay, despite the fact that the game is very dynamic, I do not get carsick!
I'd like to see in the future more customization of your character and variety of tactical weapons and gadgets, now this is not enough.
Multiplayer for 10 players on the big map is very cool even at this stage! I hope the developers will continue to develop this game and we will get a full analogue of Quake in VR!
Excuse me for my French)","Mar 3, 2019 at 6:57 PM",5, 5,Thank you so much!

2022-05-28 19:13:52.602015,d0x360,needs dual analog free locomotion,i think that would improve gameplay significantly,"Apr 20, 2019 at 1:36 AM",3, 1,Thank you for your opinion! We work hard and soon improve the gameplay! Please check the new update!
