2022-05-28 19:28:17.313223,KeMarcY3,Too simple...,"The idea is good, but I think it could be more fun, and shorter... It's time waisting in 50%","Dec 12, 2020 at 3:58 AM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 19:28:17.356108,Satconcook,A neat music video in VR,"Nothing really crazy, but some blocks progressing to the music. I could see something like this expanding into a full album if you just wanted to watch visuals inspired by music. It’s worth checking out, as it is free, if you want to see more than the store trailer in actual 3D.","Feb 7, 2020 at 2:14 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 19:28:20.478756,Wazhead,Short but really good.,"Well, I loved it.  There's a real sense of presence with this.  It's a strange land where you experience some sort of intelligence.  Good music.  I'd like to know if the maker has done anything similar since. Good music that needs to be loud and abrasive (because that fits the atmosphere that is being transmitted).","Jan 3, 2020 at 1:47 AM",5, 2,"We did some other games (KIN for example) and some other smaller games, but those are not available as they where for Muse's latest world tour VIP lounge.
Arjan also has some other music available on his own site : www.arjanm.com"

2022-05-28 19:28:20.507679,nightcat.mau,Terrible,"I swear I did not get the same app everyone else did. I first tried this with my Rift headphones all the way up. It was as painful as the shrill shrieks in A Large Quantity of Mushrooms. OK, my bad for having my volume up, So I retried it with the volume almost off. Bearable, but the bright mushroom cloud was actually painful to look at. I’m happy people liked it, but if you are sensitive to certain noises or bright lights this will drop you like a stun gun.","Jul 12, 2018 at 1:45 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 19:28:20.522638,HeyJesseAe,Great,"Pretty interesting VR music experience. I really like that there was a semblance of progression, not just random visuals. The physics-based movement is pretty interesting.","Jan 21, 2018 at 11:08 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 19:28:20.536601,rapterra,"People seem to like anything, not good..","Well this is just a very basic music video, as far as music videos go its ok, nothing special, and the music is more like constant sound effects rather than a song and I personally dont think as a song it was very good at all and I am someone with a huge stereo system (5x 15 inch subs, 2x 12inch & 2x 10 inch plus the Speakers all in one room!) and I have some of the best Headphones money can buy and am a big music lover, this is a very short video clip and isnt very interesting, personally I would skip it, not worth the time, Check out ""Lost"" the short video which is 10 times better!","Feb 24, 2018 at 2:46 PM",2, 2,

2022-05-28 19:28:23.626338,RyanDailyVR,A great start and a fun demo,"There are some really cool concepts in here. Some of it just kinda rolls blankly but the music is really good. There are a few ""oh wow!"" moments. I would love to see what this author could do if they had more time and money. I look forward to their next one!","Aug 13, 2017 at 5:52 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:28:23.641297,berickphilip,Sweet,Nice music and animation. Before the final part there are a few seconds of boring nothingness. But overall it was great. Thank you for this!! Going to show it to my friends and family.,"Jul 28, 2017 at 10:55 PM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 19:28:26.785887,neuro27,Highly Recommended,"Being able to feel the music is something VR does well and in this musical VR experience video you will discover how good it can be. The music might not be to your own tastes, but it is still worth watching it anyway just to experience it. Is this the future of music videos? Maybe it is, but when will future musical experiences like this start costing us money to experience? My guess it will be sooner rather than later. But for now this one is free and well worth a download.","May 21, 2017 at 12:26 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:28:26.800847,vtid,Still a great experience in 2017,"This was the first audio/visual app of this kind that I tried, about a year ago.  It's just the right length, good tune, fairly simple but very effective visuals.  Great job.","Jun 25, 2017 at 8:38 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 19:28:36.268524,karrtoon,Awesome!,"I liked the music, and amazing concept for VR music videos. Wish more people would make music video experiences of this qualtiy!

If there were one downside though it's that you can only watch it so many times, and there isn't much reason to come back after that.","Sep 14, 2016 at 12:42 PM",5, 6,
