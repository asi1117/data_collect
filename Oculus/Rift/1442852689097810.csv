2022-05-28 19:44:33.444303,FastLawyer,Gregor Mendel explains peas to kids,"So you get a good VR environment (reading room) to set the mood right to read a comic and listen to some classical music.  You can listen to one of three classical tracks, all solid choices.  Then you read a story about Gregor Mendel, who is considered to be the father of the study of Genetics.  The selection is done by gaze and when you select the voice icon the narration starts for that page.  When you finish the two narrated portions, you can flip the page with gaze as well.  The whole experience takes less than 9 minutes.  Don't expect an action or adventure story, this is a story about the scientific process, data collection, and the start of modern genetics.  As far as it being too dark (reviewer below)?  I didn't think so, it added a little to the ambience in the room.  There isn't a whole lot of reading involved, just a few words that the narrator will go over audibly anyways.","Mar 4, 2018 at 1:07 AM",5, 2,

In front of you there is an old-style book that when opened reveals a comic strip of Gregor Mendel. Because the room is so dark, you have a flashlight to look at the pages. Each page has a button that, when stared at, activates a narration. It tells the story of the founding of genetics and the concepts of dominant and recessive traits. Overall, it's an interesting learning experience that puts you in a neat environment. I just wish the room wasn't so dimly lit that you needed a flashlight to read.","Feb 5, 2018 at 12:06 PM",4, 2,
