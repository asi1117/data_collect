2022-05-28 14:22:33.681961,TREofWAR,Question to the DEVS,"EDIT - first, i dont know if it's been pointed out, but if you put your controller up to your head, it zooms into wherever you are looking, i did not see any videos of anyone pointing that out, i figured it out by accident. 

question 1) what is INSTAJUMP I found it out around uranus moons.. it's a small purplle star but it's very strange.. I can find no information about it online.. just wondering what it is, I thought it might have been a portal or wormhole or something lol 

question to devs-
would it be possible to get texture packs or something like reshade working with VR games? I have not played this yet, it's downloading and from what i have seen it looks absolutely breath taking, i will update my review once I play it. But, it seems some of the moons when up close aren't as hi def and i'm just curious, for anyone that has a beefy enough pc to handle it, if it would be possible for you to create and we install OPTIONAL texture packs. I think that would be amazing. Maybe even a version where all stars not render in, and only the planet so you could pull more rendering power for viewing the planets/moons?","Sep 16, 2020 at 6:02 AM",5, 22,

2022-05-28 14:22:36.865538,VRPhantom,An Engaging Tour of the Solar System,"I've always been an astronomy fan so when I purchased my Rift S and started perusing the library this title immediately piqued my curiosity. The premise is a natural for VR: you are in a spaceship and can either fly to any planet in the solar system or sit back and enjoy several guided tours of different planets and other heavenly objects.

Graphically, the game looks quite good. Some of the terrain when you do flybys close to the surface of planets or moons could be a little more detailed but the sense of scale is outstanding and some of the vistas, like travelling thru the rings of Saturn are downright breathtaking.

For $9.99 the experience is a great value if you are into astronomy or space exploration. It's one of my favorite titles so far.","Jul 30, 2019 at 10:04 AM",5, 28,

2022-05-28 14:22:36.895458,MVShaw111,Ok,"I am a little dissappointed with this title. This feels like an early beta that could have been done better. 
The graphics are pretty nice but I just don't get the sense of scale I was anticipating. The planets just feel small and are not textured with much detail at all when you go near the surface. The lighting is done well, texture and scale lacking.","Apr 6, 2019 at 10:37 AM",3, 18,
2022-05-28 14:22:36.910419,Angelina Starr,Explanation please...,"Could someone please explain the flashes of light zipping past the shuttle craft?  I know a bit about astronomy and I can't think of anything that would cause that.  They can't be meteors as meteors don't light up until they enter the atmosphere (from friction in the air).  They can't be cosmic rays because the astronauts said they only noticed them when their eyes were shut because they were so faint.  Are these a graphic rendering artefact?  Whaaaa???

It really detracts from the immersion.

Addendum - I emailed the devs days ago, asking this same question with no response as of yet.   Come on devs.","Mar 12, 2019 at 10:12 PM",3, 25,
2022-05-28 14:22:40.003266,FastLawyer,Makes a thinking person question life,"So I took a space tour of the earth.  I think I almost cried at the end.  It doesn't have the best graphics.  But if you have ever wondered what it would be like to be on a small spaceship on your own and auto-pilot around our planet and towards the sun and back, then this is for you.  This is as close to a realistic simulation of the that experience as you'll find.  Something about the vastness of the space, the warmth of the sun, the cold of it's shadow, seeing how tiny our planet is, seeing your country in a different light or in darkness, and imagining that you're but a speck from the view up above ... and you will lose yourself.  Question life, and death, your priorities, your beliefs, and everything.  .  Realize your non-importance and do the best you can with that knowledge.

2022-05-28 14:22:40.051138,goonie,This is why you bought your Oculus Rift,"This experience hits home what virtual reality is all about. This is an experience that cannot be duplicated as a movie, a painting, a seminar, concert, videogame... and, instead, it combines all of these things into one whole experience. Moreover, it reaches newfound levels that cannot be reached inside fictitious worlds and, especially, within linear games and Hollywood movies, because this allows for free exploration and it is based on our REAL surroundings. Think Google Earth but for our solar system.

The controls are just right. The menus are easy to understand. The narration, although a bit too computer like, is timed very well. Excellent music and polish...

But put all technicalities aside for a moment. What matters most is the emotional response. Nothing can prepare you for the feeling of discoving an ominous comet hurtling silently through the vastness of space, for observing Saturn rise above the horizon of one of its moons, for soaring across the wavy surfaces of Neptune, or launching through the stormy atmosphere of Venus. What you're observing here is our greater surroundings outside of Earth's atmosphere. This experience is all about PERSPECTIVE and you will perceive Earth and the rest of the solar system as you have never experienced it before. If you always dreamed of being an astronaut you will find interest in this title.

Remember that feeling you get when you watched a movie for the first time, or read a book for the first time, or even experienced VR for the first time... well, this brings back that feeling. The more I soared around, the better it got, and I noticed the developer threw in a few things for fun as well, but I won't spoil the surprises here.

Well worth the cost and I hope the developers continue to add to this experience, even beyond Pluto and Charon, as NASA continues to provide back data from its observations. Thank you for making this extraordinary experience. I can only imagine what it will be in 5 or 10 more years.","Nov 26, 2018 at 2:14 PM",5, 17,

It feels like being there alone on that Journey through Cosmos and Time. I especially love the exploration of Comet. I could fly over fumes from ground, see how huge it is, yet barely visible in Space. I wish this experience was updated in 2019, with more detailed textures, better particle effects, more ships, more details on space objects and... the ability to fly over Earth and other planets. Currently there is no such possibility. I hope the creators do not abandon this product. Please update this, to 2019 quality levels.","Apr 5, 2019 at 8:46 AM",5, 3,

The narration is excellent and the planet models are fabulous, the atmosphere of Jupiter took myu breath away with the boiling, rolling cloud belts and storms.
Add to that the little easter eggs that add some fun to the whole thing spent 3 hours on my first go and look forward to getting back in and seeing more.

The Breath feature and Window frosting, are good/effective/immersive ...
once I realised what they were.  (Not sinking with my resperation cycle, at firs I was looking for a cracked window.)  An option to turn Breath and Frosting off would be liked by me.  Also I am not a great fan of LENS/Cinamatic/DOF features.  I Just don't Percive like that)

Don't delete items or option but perhaps an options sub menu for effects?

2022-05-28 14:22:43.229775,UglyFish819,,"Decent game with good graphic and information. The biggest problem with it though is the fact that when flying around space the fastest you can go is the speed of light. This means if you want to fly to Neptune for example you get to sit in the game and watch the stars go by for 15 minutes .. very booring! Its cool that this is built to scale, but who wants to sit still for 15 minutes? They should have a 'warp speed' option for easy exploration.","Jul 19, 2018 at 3:53 AM",3, 21,
2022-05-28 14:22:46.339043,Pete8593,High quality VR travel to the planets!,This program is quite likely the best reality based VR space simulator that is presently available.   It gives one an accurate idea of how far the planets and moons of our Solar System are from Earth as well as from each other.  The graphics are very good and permit one to view the planets from any desired angle and at any desired size in a 3D format.  The only thing I'd like to see added are some real named stars positioned in such a way as to teach people where the Constellations of the sky are located as one travels through space.,"Aug 25, 2018 at 1:27 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 14:22:46.369960,Tomatenmann,Great space tour for VR beginners,"My favorite educational space experience in VR. Almost all the tours are very interesting and well executed. My favorites are the ones around Jupiter and the ""Rosetta"" asteroid. There is also a nice free flight mode. And it might be a good appetizer for people who are interested in Elite Dangerous.

A few things that prevent 5 stars:

- Free flight is too slow. Traveling at the speed of light is nice but still not fast enough to get to the outer planets in under 20 minutes.

- The english narrator is ok, but the german one is just horrible. Many sentences don't make any sense. Like some really bad google translation.

- The cockpit and especially the player model could use more finetuning.


But still it's a very impressive piece of work for such a small developer.","Jul 22, 2018 at 12:24 PM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 14:22:46.387913,tuomaspap,This is the epitomy of space VR,Any developer such as UBISOFT for  (Star Trek : Bridge Crew) etc should have this game as point of reference for a space game . The graphics and feeling you are in space and on a shuttle are like no other . Take the Free roam option and fly yourself around . Everything is real size and detailed down to craters. You can fly on to a planet and sit in its craters and the detail is still there . Trully exceptional . I wish you would make a game with this as a base .

2022-05-28 14:22:49.507184,noozled,"If you love space, or are a geek, get it","I have played Elite Dangerous before which I loved, but I felt it is more for the content and missions, less for the VR Immersiveness (I still do love it, but I was looking for slightly more made for VR). If you have been looking to explore space in VR but not be working on missions, this is the app for you. It also on top of being awesome to explore our Solar System (yes, only our Solar System), is pretty educational. I actually learned a lot of fun facts about planets and moons I never knew before. And it truly is mindblowing kicking back in some of the premade tours watching some of the prepared views. I also LOVE how some of the planets have moving weather (Jupiter in particular). It really has some convincing graphics. My absolute favorite moment in this simulator was the 2001 Easter Egg. I wont tell you how to get there because it will spoil the surprise, but spend some time observing Jupiter's satellites... I am a huge fan of 2001 so when I saw this easter egg I nearly s**t myself. Let's just say it caught me off guard. The only things I can say would improve the game are if the planets were solid (flying through the planets is a bit immersion breaking), and instead of flying through them you maybe bounce off of the surface if you contact it, or if you touch it softly you can land, and if Earth in particular had more detail. 3D rendered buildings or nature would be pretty awesome. I know it is a lot of work, but maybe just something more to Earth and it would be soo cool. Thanks for the awesome VR experience.","May 14, 2018 at 3:17 AM",5, 13,

BEYOND what I could imagine even.  I have just messed around with it a little and I'm already SO impressed.  I took off in some way cool space ship, quickly got comfortable with navigating, and headed for Jupiter.  When I got there my JAW DROPPED.  I was literally in shock.  Not only was it just cool as anything to be flying in space orbiting a planet (I felt like I was on a star trek mission to some strange planet) but the planet was HUGE and MOVING... I mean like weather!  I even went to the moons and decided to get down to the surface and there's mountains, and terrain and it seems to scale even.  Wow wow wow.

Wow, after mission ISS and a number of other similar games this tops the tree. This developer deserves a very hefty pat on the back and a high five. A couple of things that aren't obvious when you start playing;
- You can lift your touch controller upto your face to zoom in.
- Joystick is supported, turn off 'touch controller in flight' in the controller config menu.
This has to be the best few pounds I've spent so far since owning a Rift and I have allsorts on Oculus (and Steam). Traversing the solar system and stopping to admire when you want is an absolute pleasure, and if you can't be bothered to pilot, take the guided (fully narrated) tours and sit back and relax.

2022-05-28 14:22:59.008097,McNabb,One of my most used apps,"I f'n love this app. There's something so peaceful and calming about flying your own ship through space (cozy 1-seater or more roomy 5-seater - the SUV of spaceships, and if my dad who lives far away could sit in the passenger seat I'd buy him his own PC and rift just for that). Lots of nice details add to the immersion, like blue shift at high speed and condensation on the windows when you emerge from the dark side of a planet.  You can also take tours on autopilot and just relax, and actually learn something from the narration. There are even a few surprises. UPDATE: There are warp gates! You have to go through them manually, and 'Mode' doesn't seem to work on the big ship, but it's a big help for the smaller one. Also, you can switch seats! In the little ship it puts you outside which is neat but terrifying, but in the big one it's breathtaking, being able to see the view through the canopy or monitors. Just minor issues now - autopilot sometimes sends you into a planet and can't navigate around them, and if you set 'Body' to off in settings, it's still there, morbidly flailing its handless arms your direction looking for its own while you pop about the cabin. Other than that, an immersive masterpiece and the kind of thing VR is made for; I'm hoping for updates to improve the experience even further.","Mar 12, 2018 at 3:11 PM",5, 7,"Thanks for the comments.  To help with the long distance travel, go searching for the jump gates.  These are dotted around various planets and form a network of jumps to allow you to quickly hop around.  You can find them using the navigation menu ... use the ""mode"" button to select ""nearest"", which will show you the nearest objects around you, which will include the jump gates.  Find one, enter slowly, and hold on !!!"

2022-05-28 14:23:02.152829,VirtuaLieven,Wonderful and scientifically accurate,"This app can be used to search the solar system, but also as a relax tool. Go onto autopilot and just stare into the vast nothingness of space. I also enjoy flying on/over planet surfaces, and some more details would be appreciated (hint: Moon and Mars have been completely cartographed).
There's nothing that needs to be changed, but I'm looking forward to see improvements: Like walking around in the start menue hall. I'm missing a backwards gear (could be included in the speed reducer key). Some more buttons in the cockpit to click on with small (even useless) functions would be nice (such as closing windows, set up a light filter making windows darker, show the real computer time). Maybe an entirely new cockpit? Note: sometimes stars have a huge halo of brightness around them, which I think does not look natural. German reader really needs improvement, but I can live with it. (although the automatic speaker skips German ß (&szlig;), which is quite annoying).","Feb 20, 2018 at 9:12 PM",5, 5,

I also love the improvements on the ""surprises"" sprinkled around the solar system. As an educator of Science I would LOVE it if this could be expanded to allow real VR passengers. I can imagine parking the craft, with several of my stduents (in VR) as passengers, hovering above the rings of a gas giant or  with in the Mariner Valley on Mars and discussing their key features and then flying off to the next site of interest. Adding to this ""wish list"" ; expanding the program to include the ability (through jump gates) to visit some of the Kepler probe star systems and or Nebulae, Black Holes, Neutron stars, and so on. Again, thank you for the upgrades.","Jan 3, 2018 at 6:32 AM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 14:23:02.217655,funnywheeno,Fun!,"Just the right amount of complexity to enjoy exploring the solar system without having to study up on controls forever. Ships look nice and are relatively easy to control. Did come across some bugs. When approaching a planet, sometimes the controls get stuck and I have to press the thumbsticks in to regain control. I've gotten sucked into a planet that way once and didn't know how to get back out. pressing the left thumbstick in seems to sometimes push the POV camera backwards. Being really close to the surface of a planet or moon tends to mess with the throttle control in a way that doesn't feel like gravity influence. Autopilot sometimes fails to approach a jump portal correctly and keeps looping around. Most planets look quite nice and even have nicely animated surface textures but getting really close keeps me wanting for more detail (procedural as in SpaceEngine?) in texture and depth. Engine sounds are wonderfully massaged in along with the seamless throttle up to light speed, but the visual effect of light speed looks a little bit like a bug. I don't know if it's scientifically more accurate than what we are used to from Sci-Fi, but if the rear becomes dark and there is reduced field of view on the sides, shouldn't the front get much brighter instead of turning dark blue and shifting away? Looking forward to updates!","Feb 13, 2018 at 3:23 AM",4, 2,

There are space loop drives. You are only limited to the solar system. There is no action in this game. If you like walking sims you will like space sims otherwise stay away this is not for you.

Just get close to Saturn or any other, grab a beer, sit on your couch and enjoy the immense pleasure of being in outer space with those wonderful views, doing nothing at all. Incredibly relaxing and immersive.
That being said, the Tour mode is where this app really shines, it will take you around and over planets with the best possible views, you will learn about them and enjoy seeing the solar system in a way you only dreamed about.

Google Earth is an awesome expereince, but I wanted something more in terms of exploring our solar system.  I then found this app during my search.  I am reminded of when I was a kid at the planetarium, looking up at the stars and being bewildered.  Fast forward to today, you are in a VR ship and can choose between solo flight, or a tour of various locations.  I selected the tour and immediately I got the same feeling I did when I was a kid.  My only complaint was my arms, while resting were bent pointing up, which made for a slight distraction of the enjoyable experience.

(b) Will there be planetary details added? I went atmospheric at Earth, and everything is just brown and blue. While I found it cool to go in and out of atmsophere, I was hoping to see some cities or something.

- Higher resolution textures
- Improved Sun (not so realistic)
