I stare at an hourglass at the bottom right for minutes with beautiful loop background music and nothing happens?

2022-05-28 20:10:41.636610,Angelina Starr,I'm not ashamed to say...,"....I got very emotional when you talked about your grandfather.  Mine was such an important part of my life growing up.  And yes, I got to fish AND play horse shoes with him too.  Precious memories.

Like you, I was an older kid before I learned of the internment camps here in the USA on the west coast where I grew up.  I was a teen in the late 1970s and even then, I simply couldn't believe we could do such a thing.  And if I am to bare my chest here - I had no idea until watching your VR story tonight, that this awful thing also occured in Canada.  I have watched and read terra bytes of history about these times and can't recall ever reading about the Canadian camps.

I know your grandpa would be very proud of you and what you have done here.  I hope your father gets to see it if he hasn't already.

As for the production quality itself - it's second to none - perfect in every way.  And thank you so much for not making it political and devisive.  

A standing ovation has been earned by you and your team.  My hat's off to all of you.","Oct 26, 2020 at 12:07 PM",5, 11,"Dear Double_Shot, thank you so much for your detailed and kind review.
