I should be able to get solid 90 fps using ss 2.0 with a RTX 2070 Super and Rift CV1, but this is not the case. Still it's working ok-ish. Thus devs didn't optimize this game properly.  
Also the lazy devs didn't include full Oculus driver support in the Steam version - forcing users to buy the Oculus version for optimal performance.  
The game is fun, but I'd rather like a fullscreen view without seeing a stick in front of me - and the in-game VR cockpit parts are just awful and should be removed. 2c.","Apr 17, 2021 at 8:01 PM",3, 30,
