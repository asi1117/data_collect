Having watched my 1st video and seeing the issues/problems I had, the developers have updated the game ASAP and now it works as intended.
Overall a good zombie shooter with a neat time travelling story and Arcade mode.
Combat was good and fun and my only gripes now is the game has some terrible voice acting and I also noticed bullets clipping and not firing through certain objects.

(MY ORIGINAL REVIEW)
The game has a lot of promise, I started the campaign mode and was pleasantly surprised with the game having a story mode, I thought this was going to be a generic zombie shooter. My problems started during the 1st World War 2 mission, I had no weapons, even after selecting them previously. I even restarted the game, tried starting a new game, but this did not resolve the fact I had no weapons.
So, I decided to jump into arcade mode and I could not for the life of me select a location to start Arcade mode. I tried all button combinations, again restarting the game, but no luck.
So I never got to try out the action part of the game which is a shame.
If the issues get fixed I'll try the game again and update my review, but for now for me its broken. (ALL ISSUES FIXED NOW!)","Jan 8, 2020 at 1:09 AM",4, 2,"Thank you for your review!

After playing it i think its the same devs?

Anyways , this game is really fun , but i did not played it long. >>
Sended to the future to stop an outbreak and then go back , 

Going to WW2 trying to kill hitler , all still fun but when u die fighting a boss battle u have to restart the entire level again. would be better just start the boss battle.
I like this kinda games , its fun , looks good :) sound is fine but just the part if u die and need to redo the level is something i dont like so much.
Makes me quit the game and move on to another game and give it a new try another time.
still imo worth 5 stars","Jan 7, 2020 at 11:04 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:56:31.104738,Stay21,Nice fight  mechanics :),Good fight mechanics for this price. Mix of a few systems i saw in other games. Story mode is a plus and a lot of weapons.,"Jan 6, 2020 at 2:33 AM",5, 1,

Fun  (not short) Story and Robo Recall fight system in cartoon edition. The time in Arcade mode should be longer, but i assume this is related to weapons cost.","Jan 6, 2020 at 3:18 AM",5, 2,
