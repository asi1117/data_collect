2022-05-28 13:20:25.841445,acanz90,Worth Every Penny,People complaining about the price are rediculous. This game continously is receiving updates and it runs like a champ. This is the game I let friends and family try when they are experiencing VR for the first time. I just wish the players body wasnt a twig.,14 days ago,5, 4,
2022-05-28 13:20:25.856404,TommyIsdaking,I like it but...,"I wish you could play cross plat form because my friends have quest but I have the rift and I really want to play with them. If it does have cross platform, how do you invite your friends?",20 days ago,4, 3,"Hey TommyIsdaking! Thank you for sending us your feedback! Unfortunately, there's no crossplay :( but your friends can connect their Quests to their PCs and then use it to play the PC version with you!

Anything you need, feel free to reach us out,

2022-05-28 13:20:25.903784,GreenBeanss,Not worth the price tag.,"13.99 is too much for this game. 4.99 would be perfect. I had fun the 40 minutes i played, levels kept restarting themselfs. NPC's hardly had any health or fought back. They would normally run away from you leaving the level. Overall 3 star review. Price needs to be lowered.",Jan 18 at 8:25 AM,3, 32,"GreenBeanss, hey!
