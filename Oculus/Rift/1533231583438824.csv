2022-05-28 19:11:21.520106,SteveG7RTA,Excellent Ride!,"Wow! I enjoyed that. I'd say it was part rollercoaster & part ghost train, but it is certainly entertaining and seems to go on for ages.
The sound of the minecar you're sat in, going along the track isn't very realistic & if you're looking for realistic VR coasters you need to google ""No Limits 2"" (expensive but well worth it!!) 
However, this one is the best I''ve seen on the Oculus store & I recommend it. It's fast paced & full of surprises.","Nov 26, 2018 at 11:00 PM",5, 2,

Would like it to be a bit longer ...  Auto restart is Good !!!","Sep 7, 2018 at 11:04 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:11:21.550025,nightcat.mau,Wow!,"I was shaking after like on a real life coaster, so yes, perfect ride! I loved the different enviroments and yes, saw a few assets/style designs they repeated with the Thor coaster, but overall a great thrill ride.","Aug 6, 2018 at 2:22 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 19:11:24.689628,theregoes2,"Finally, a good roller coaster!","Most of the roller coasters on Rift are terrible and some are okay at best. I've never understood why so many roller coaster apps are made and, aside from having a break in the track, do almost nothing that a real roller coaster couldn't do. This one does plenty that you could never do in real life. On top of that it's smooth as butter except at points were you are going through a portal and it seems to be loading a new scene. It's long for a coaster with lots of cool scenery. Until this came out the best VR coaster was Rilix on the Gear VR, which was pretty sad.","Jan 25, 2018 at 12:45 PM",4, 19,
2022-05-28 19:11:24.703591,Puera,Well that was a waste...,"Game freezes at the control intro screen; the music plays but that's about it.  I have an Intel Core i7-4790k and 2 X EVGA Titan X Hybrids with water coolers with the HB bridge in SLI (yes I know it only uses one card for VR), and 32GB of RAM.  It should play this game without any issues.  It's way stronger than the recommended specs yet it refuses to get past the intro screen.  Please fix this so I can update this rating.","Mar 10, 2018 at 1:42 PM",1, 0,
