2022-05-28 19:40:12.814451,price_kelley,Its a Music video,"This funky little number will have you looking about the place and occasionally twirling your touch input device to creat ribbons in the cartoonish sky, bit of a slowcoaster ride as an experience, the audio being the purpose behind the app seems to be slightly distroted though? more noise going on then there should be in parts which destroyed the track your trying to promote, every other app I run doesnt have this issue and from experience the distortion from to many elements or components that make the track are seemingly deliberate. Other than a group then nobody has ever heard of or likely never will - it was ok, keep it to show your grandparents what vr is like, dont worry they wont get confused about controlls - there are none, not even a camera or position recentre option (which the app gets wrong randomly). This barely made 3 stars but reached the score because the market is a place of bland, repetative (yet more escape rooms!), ill created and baren apps to few and far between, makes you wonder if facebook just wanted Oculus to chash in quick on you purchasing a device and then abandon you and its market after your cheques are chashed (or your wanrranty expires). Thats all ive got for a comment.....go away now.",Sep 16 at 8:15 AM,3, 0,

2022-05-28 19:40:12.859332,Bob-Rolha,"More contrast and less fog, please","I like tours like this, in which we travel through the environment without having to control anything, just to observe, this allows us to enjoy the VR scenarios in the best way. The weak point is that the tour is very short, could be longer. Another weak point is the non-contrasting scene with blurred colors, as if there was a cloudiness in every environment. I think the fog should only exist at long distances, and the clearest visibility for short distances. I ask the developer to correct this, and I will increase the rating from 3 to 4 stars.","Oct 2, 2018 at 11:45 PM",3, 2,
