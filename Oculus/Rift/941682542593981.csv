2022-05-28 16:52:19.072623,CaptainScarlet,"I want to like this app, I really do.","Firstly I've been a long time (on and off) user of this application. By this I mean I've seen it go thru numerous versions and the experience is always the same. When it works well it merits 5 stars and when it doesn't it gets 1 star (thus the average 3 star rating).

About a month ago it was running flawlessly and then in what seems to be the developers' SOP (standard operating procedure) they do an update that renders it either very frustrating or useless.  The latest update seems to have done the latter. Although I hear sound in my environment or people around me I get no sound from any video I watch (and yes, I have installed the audio driver Bigscreen asks me to install).  :(

However, I still have hope that the problem will be fixed. It definitely isn't as bad as a version from early 2018 that was so broken I unistalled the application.

C'mon devs give me a reason to love this app again.","Jan 5, 2020 at 3:08 PM",3, 18,

The headset position is tracked but the position of the hand controllers is ignored. I realise that you do not need to move your hands around to get the demo to work but that's not the point. Having half the Guardian system not work is not good. I know it is a free demo, but even ""free"" should not be dangerous. If the hand controllers are to be ignored, then a Health and Safety warning at the start of the demo should say so.
