2022-05-28 19:24:14.935496,TRU313DG3ND,The devs has never shot or own a firearm,"I know that this is a bit controversal, but this isn't how a firearm actually work. They had made bolt action rifles as semi auto (which it is quite obvious to those who actually fired a gun in their lives). And I am going to assume that the semiauto rifles acting like bolt action as well. The scope is fine, same with the shooting mechanics. But the animation for bolt action sniper rifles and semi auto sniper rifles being mixed up needs to be fixed. Although having mag appear out of nowhere makes it more of an arcade like experience. It would've been better if you had mags on the chest of the player and for the player to grab it instead would make the experience much better.

I am not saying this to insult the devs, but the devs should've realized the rifles were switched and need to correct every rifle from the starting to the end. And yes, this is my impression of a demo.

Although the other reviews about how to zoom the scope and to reload is already been hinted, (x is to summon the clip) and left analogue stick for the scope zoom.","Aug 19, 2020 at 1:17 AM",1, 9,

In the end, the training level wouldnt let me reload, though it would let me do everything else, the scope was inconsistent with it's visuals, and the overall performance was underwhelming.

2022-05-28 19:24:33.899774,Aeromixx,Excited & Disappointed,"I was so hyped there was a cool VR Sniper game finally, however in this game, you are literally standing out in the open! No sniper would ever do that! You die relentlessly before being able to pass any mission. It's aggravating more than entertaining. I wouldn't even mind it being hard, just at least give us cover, and the ability to move. You can walk in the main menu, but not in the game! Makes no sense. This game had me so excited and left me rather annoyed that the developers missed the very very very tiny detail that snipers don't stand out in the middle of a battlefield where 20 people and helicopters can see them and shoot them. Not even a challenge or ""hard"", but moreso a senseless frustration.

Will gladly give this game a second chance, as I believe a VR Sniper game can be a big hit. The controls, graphics, and gameplay are amazing, I will give it that. Just the fundamentals of the game need to be fixed before I would ever purchase. Keep it up, don't give up, and listen to your fans.","Oct 15, 2018 at 2:35 AM",2, 11,

2022-05-28 19:24:40.242808,KikiTay,Frustrating!,"There are just so many things wrong with this I don't know where to begin.. very unintuitive controls, you have to read every instructions displayed instead of depending on your natural human instinct, it makes the game very frustrating
 just to figure out the controls. Sometimes the grab button is ""A"" and sometimes it's ""X"" and sometimes you pull the trigger to grab an item.
 Movements are either restricted or super sensitive using the old school nausea way of navigating. The game is hard to play and it takes away any fun or joy you might expect from playing a game. You are a sniper yet you stand openly still in an open area with 3 or 4 people shooting at you. This feels like an incomplete demo back in the DK2 era. But instead of giving this a straight 1-star review I must give credit to some of the good points. The concept is good and the graphics are great. The game does look promising but for now it's just unplayable. I hope the developers would continue to work on it. Perhaps update the controls and focus on making it fun rather than challenging. And get rid of that irritating background music loop!
