Not worth more than a few dollars. Even then, you'll likely end up dissapointed.

It's a cool concept for a game. But I expect many, like myself, were expecting something with a more traddiontal simulation of an actual traffic cop in terms of controls. You don't hold your hand out to stop cars or wave to keep them moving, it's very simple point and click (as seen in the trailer on the store page). It tries to add in shooting and throwing elements but they're both very generic and very janky.

The biggest problem is the perspective and height setting. You feel like you're 2 feet off the ground and it scews the viewpoint for everything and makes it downright unsettling. Using the slingshot is impossible because you're real height is different than your in-game height, so angles are all messed up.

Furthermore, there's no settings or tutorial or anything that should be standard in anything that isn't a tech demo. I suppose that's what this is. A tech demo, and not a very good one. It's fun for a few minutes but it is quickly bogged down by its low budget and quality. I don't suggest paying even the On Sale price ($5 at the time of this review). Maybe $1-3 if it interests you and ever drops that low, or is updated with better content and basic features.","May 4, 2019 at 1:23 AM",2, 10,
