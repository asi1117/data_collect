You'll spend more time annoyed with the droid than actually enjoying the game. And when you start to enjoy the game, you're at the end. The trap is, you got a taste of the story and now you are either really curious how to continue, or fed up and walk away. You bought this because you are into Star Wars and no one would walk away when standing next to Darth Vader.  Way too short for how much it costs.",May 2 at 3:03 AM,2, 6,

I'm glad the game is cross-buy because I wanted to have a choice between devices so I chose to install it to my computer instead cause I knew the game would look much better graphically.
My only major problem with the game is/was the brightness. The in game is very dark making it difficult to appreciate the graphics and there's no settings to change gamma/brightness at all, but thankfully I found a post by u/AchillesPDX explaining how to fix the brightness issue.
The fix: %username%\appdata\local\WKND\saved\config\WindowsNoEditor\Engine.ini, and add this string of code:
[/Script/Engine.Engine]
DisplayGamma=3.5

Feel free to change that 3.5 into something higher or lower to suit your particular taste.

If it wasn't for finding his post online I would of given the game a three star only. If the DEVS one day fix this issue allowing to change the brightness setting I'll change my rating to a five star.",Dec 16 at 1:27 AM,4, 47,

2022-05-28 11:16:08.172486,willmodo,Nice experience - a bit pricey,"It's a half hour or so interactive experience more than a game.  There's a few easy puzzles to solve and a bit of combat which is straightforward to overcome, but mostly it's a story to enjoy.  The graphics quality is meh, and overall it won't amaze experienced VR players.  But, the story so far has a nice atmosphere about it and it hits the sweet spot with my 9yr old kids (I'm not sure why its PG16), and for that reason alone I will probably buy the other episodes.

If it was cheaper then it would get 4 or 5 stars - but for the same money as the three episodes you can get a lot more in another game or experience",Jul 13 at 1:01 AM,3, 11,

The game took me an hour and that's including technical difficulties with my wifi (airlink). This is a joke even for 10$. Basically you learn a little lore, solve a few puzzles, and fight a few things. Fighting is as simple as just flailing your lightsaber around and you will parry everything.

in Quest 2 link mode, the flash of light in some scee is too suden/ too bright/ too frequent. For example the lightsaber is too bright when waving. And the effects of being hit and deflecting shots are too bright.
Those frequest flash of light can cause health issue. I love the game so I really hope the dev team can address this.

One thing that make it worse is the overall theme is TOO DARK. 
I under stand it has to be dark to make the atmosphere. 
But we can't barely see thing in some scene.  for example in the cutting pipe scene. It is too dark. So our eye adust to the dark lighting level. But the lightsaber is very bright so it make my eyes hurt.   

Strangely the lighting level feels comfortable in Quest 2 standalone version.

It can be a bit dark in places, but the controls work very well. The light saber duels are very satisfying, with a focus on blocking and parrying. Kind of reminds me Jedi Fallen Order in that respect, where in you must parry first to get an attack in. I also like that it allows you to climb using motion, though I wish it wasn't forced.

All the fighting parts are extremely short (about a minute for each fight) This is almost like playing an introduction to a game, rather than it being ""Part 1""

2022-05-28 11:16:20.845429,camf33,Excellent VR entry for the SW franchise,"Fun : - )
Pros: Incredible to live the SW universe in VR.
Cons: The game is more like an interactive story, so don't expect to shoot blasters, fly, or anythign like that. You do wield a lightsaber though. 

Story : - )
Pros: You get to see a backstory on Vader's life.
Cons: It can get confusing for those that not follow the SW lore, quite possibly stories that can be forgotten.

Audio : - D
Pros: Amazing, expect no less than original SW tracks and audio directlly from ILM. 
Cons: None

Visuals :- D
Pros: Great visuals, details, and effects for every environment, it does feel like you are there. 
Cons: Lightsaber animations can look a bit off at times. Also on PCVR the gamma display is extremely dark as opposed to its mobile counterpart..

Gameplay : - |
Pros: VR mechanics are for the most part very good, wished Devs could've added more interaction all around. 
Cons: Climbing is overrated and it seems to be counter productive, other interactions could've been added other than a lot of climbing.  If I want to climb that much I'd just get 'The Climb'.

Replay Value : - |
Pros: The Dojo is exciting at first but then it becomes repetitive, nonetheless is a great experience to have fun with a lightsaber in a 360 degree of combat, and a good way to get friends into VR. 
Cons:  The game/story itself is very short, the Dojo becomes repetitive quickly, it is pretty much a quick visit just to get your lightsaber fix.","Dec 14, 2020 at 4:31 AM",5, 63,

Reason i mention Vader II even though i don't personally own it is because i tried it on a friends oculus... and was so dissapointed - its only 30 minutes long... i will never buy Vader II or III for that reason!

2022-05-28 11:16:23.959711,Slick1984,"Fantastic, except...","I would give this a 5 star review, however clipping into scenery or the robot causes a black screen and message to ""move back into the play area"". Sometimes it wasn't me that caused it. Being in the wrong place during a scene can cause it. The robot moves around and whenever I make contact, the screen goes black with that message. It completely kills all immersion. Sometimes my head clips something sticking out and boom, black screen with the message. There has to be another way of doing this. 

Otherwise, it's a giant step in the right direction for VR entertainment. The amount of detail put into this interactive movie is jaw-dropping.  I'm looking forward to the rest of the trilogy.

My hat is off to Maya Rudolph for her voice work. Great job!

BTW - Watching the first two and playing the third is bad advice. Why did you buy VR? It was to experience the worlds, well, watching it is not experiencing it. IMHO, the third part was the worst part. The first one starts the story, the second one builds on that story, the third one kills the story. It was not worth the $29.97, but it was worth more than a bad $10 part. All of the Dojo's are different. The more involved one, is the third.","Dec 21, 2020 at 2:56 AM",4, 17,

PLEASE do not listen to the good reviews like I did. This game is a rip off and a scam, and doesn't make you feel like a Jedi at all. Half the time, you're being told to do the same two puzzles to unlock an elevator, and the other half you're either following a droid, watching a cutscene or using your terrible lightsaber to ""fight"" enemies (if you hold the lightsaber straight up in front of you, it blocks all their attacks and kills them afterwords).

2022-05-28 11:16:36.628274,talonhazza,"If you want an experience YES, a game NO","This is more like an interactive story. I bought it hoping for a game, finished in one 45 min ish playthrough and to be honest was left a little disappointed. 

The graphics, nostalgia and light puzzle work are fun and the story telling draws you in, however, numerous issues for me in a game mechanic sense plague it. The combat sections are essentially 'arcade machine' style. There's no stick locomotion during these segments and that caused me to have to rely more on actually walking, which is difficult in a smaller apartment. This means unless you have a large room to play, I can't imagine there being good movement during combat. I can't speak for if the enemies might follow you as I had to stand still and try to use my small space to lean my avatar in the space to fight back.

As far as combat goes within the story segment, there's 3 fight sections and one of them is less of a fight. One against a Imperial Droid, one where you defend yourself against storm troopers and one where you fight anchient droids. The Droids all used the same pattern of attacks and became easy to read because of this, the main difficulty was once again movement. 

As mentioned, there are positives and I don't want this review keeping Star Wars fans who want a 'in your face' story telling experience away. Looking into Vaders lenses as he towered above you was spine chilling, seeing Mustafar below your ship as you come out of hyperspace and a Star Destroyer above was seriously cool... but for gamers stay away","Jan 24, 2021 at 2:21 AM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 11:16:46.089406,panzerghast,Extremely disappointed.,"The single PRO first: Darth was cool. Admittedly cool. Tall and hulking and impressive.

[SPOILERS]
CONS:
--I was able to complete the entire story in less than 1 hour. That's not even the value of a single movie ticket.
--When your head clips into a wall, it blacks you out and displays a blue icon indicating you should stop clipping. Half-Life: Alyx handles this much better by gradually fading your vision out and making it orange colored. In this case, you just go dark for no apparent reason. Very immersion-breaking.
--There is NO MOVEMENT while fighting with the LIGHT SABER!! WHAT?? You literally have to stand in place the entire time. What a waste of potential! All battle sequences take place with you in a fixed position. F**king LAME.
--There is no realism when using the light saber. Nothing is cut in half or melted the way it should be (with the one minor exeception of the small orbs that float around and shoot lasers). If I slice a robot, it should be sliced in half. If I slice anything in the game world, it should be sliced in half. Extremely disappointed.
--The VR interaction with your hands and the environment is inconsistent and iffy. You can pick up some objects (like the helmet, which I tried to put on, and it went on! That was cool!), but most times your hands just phase through walls and all objects. No contextual interaction except when the game forces it, which means very little opportunity for creative exploration and game play. You cannot even pick up your light saber in some instances. It literally prevents you from holding it. What? Where is my agency?
--Brutally linear.
--Brutally short.
--When fighting robots with Vader, you cannot move, you have to sit there and wait for robots to swing at you, counter the hits, and THEN you are allowed to strike. Any stikes you do in the meantime or with your own reach or enginuity do not count against the robots. No creativity allowed.

2022-05-28 11:16:52.358846,mdrejhon,Suggestion: Wrist-mounted closed caption,"I am a deafie.
 
Fantastic game, but one big flaw for me as a deafie -- there is no closed captioning or subtitles.

A very clever way to do it is the way Red Matter does it -- wrist mounted caption screen or subtitle screen.     This is superior to floating subtitles/captions, which are not realistic/nauseating in VR.

Real-world deaf people already use an app called ""Live Transcribe"" on android phones to caption real-life.  So this would just be a VR version of real life.  And there could be a backscroll feature if we miss dialogue, and maybe a ""screenglow"" effect coming from the bottom edge if we aren't lifting our wrists to read captions -- some of us might understand what's going on but only need to glance at captions when we need to.

Oculus Store gets docked a star because it does not have a ""Subtitles: Yes/No"" field like SteamVR does. I heard through a friend that some group at Gallaudet University (deaf university) is considering a lawsuit to Oculus to humbly request Oculus to make a minor change to Oculus Store (a Subtitles Yes/No checkbox) to get them to at least tell deaf gamers whether a VR game has subtitles or not.

P.S. I am the creator Blur Busters, which is all about high refresh rate displays, virtual reality, and high frame rates -- so we also write media coverage about VR.

The best subtitle systems are the ""Republque VR""-style gentle floats, or the ""Red Matter""-style wrist mounted pipboy equivalent. While I prefer the pipboy style approach (glance at wrist, backscrollable), 

Disney / Lucasfilm can afford to implement subtitles, so a humble request to please implement subtitles. Please? Even if I get my business to donate 500 for this good accessibility cause?","May 12, 2020 at 1:58 PM",2, 16,

2022-05-28 11:17:17.683433,aqw409,Short and buggy.,"40 ish minute of playtime without rushing anything. 
Just to get that out of the way. 

Visuals are nice if you don't look around or focus on the far away terrain because its not of greatest quality and just hurt the immursion. Different color/lighting compared to what it should be. 
Game pausing/breaking bugs that require a game restart. I had 3 all in different spots. 3 IN A 40 MINUTE LONG GAME...

If you do look around though there are lots of models with pieces missing. If you walk behind the elevator in the cavern you can look through it because the model wasn't completed or put in the right place, for example. 

Fighting mecahnics need work. If you just hold the saber in a spot that WILL blockt he attack, it just goes through the saber, you have to swing into it, WAY too much bloom/color coming off the saber to be able to use it effectivly. And the top 3 ish inches of the saber feel like they don't exist in the combat. 

Climbing is horrid. Enable the skipping.. I've played Climb. The people who made the climbing obviously haven't.

Otherwise, up the gamma/brightness a little. Lots of spots that are darker then they should be. 

And lastly. Smooth moving locamotion. Is in this game but gets stuck on litteraly everything. You walk to a table to press buttons at the start.. you have to walk backwards away from it even after its gone to be able to move forward again. 

3D models are nice but don't always follow correct lighting. Light saber doesn't make light or shadows for the player just blinds the player in darker areas. 

I don't know yet if I will be buying and playing the other chapters because 12$ for 40 minutes seems a little expensive given Alyx's release. But I probably won't refund this game either.","Mar 30, 2020 at 3:30 AM",2, 1,

- Pretty sets
- Good animations
Cons: 
- Grip doesn't work on right hand, requiring use of left for saber fighting (yes my controller is fine) and making climbing impossible without turning on ""no fail"" mode
- Less than an hour long. Most of that time is cutscenes
- Constant ""move back into play area"" messages restrict you from even looking around much
- Saber fighting is laughable. Blaster bolts fly at jogging speed. No way to increase difficulty
- Little to nothing can be interacted with in the environments. No hidden areas, secrets, or puzzles

This game feels rushed and like it is not living up to its full potential. The artists made beautiful levels but then you're hurried through them or else forced to sit and stare while your droid goes on about ""oh this view is so beautiful"". Also there's nothing to do in these levels except slowly walk behind your droid from point A to B.
The story is rather bland. ""Vader wants something that will make him so powerful! We must find it first.""
But what is most disappointing is the combat. Laughably slow and overly-telegraphed. If you want fun lightsaber combat buy Blade and Sorcery and install the Outer Rim star wars modpack from Nexus Mods.

Also, I'm quite tall and I had to reset my view in an unnatural way so that I wasn't taller than Vader. (Had to reset view while standing on a stepstool.)

The lightsaber never really felt particularly good to me, like the angle was slightly off or something.  All of the climbing aspects of this game caused a slightly sick feeling to me, and I found myself clipping through walls far too often.  The big finale felt mostly like an exercise in frustration and repetiton.

With all of that said, ILM's expertise actually shines here.  The environments, the character models and movement, the voice acting and audio - all of this was absolutely phenomenal.  Episode 1 is worth checking out for the experience of standing face to face with Vader himself, if nothing else.

So while this is not a very good game, it's a decent enough experience.  Would recommend non-VR owners to check it out at a VR arcade.  This is not a must-have experience IMO.","Feb 16, 2020 at 9:42 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 11:17:27.147004,Moginheden,Could have been so much better,"While I love the concept of this game; I found a few issues with implementation.

-You can't fall.  There is a menu option to turn falling on or off, but even with it on, if you step into empty space nothing happens.
-If you fail you get reset way too close to where you were.  At one point you need to grab someone's hand quickly.... and if you don't no big deal, the massive cliff you are falling off doesn't matter you are 3 steps back after a black screen.
-There are too many ""stand here"" moments.  The AI isn't smart enough to realise you are in the way and move around you, so you are forced to stand still in specific spots many times to get the cutscene right.  While some of this is expected, in most high end (non-VR) games there are scenes like this, but the AI will politely ask you to get out of it's way, shove you out of it's way, or walk around you.  This could have been implemented for Vader Imortal, but wasn't. (Either of the move you options would involve a slight disorientation, but no more than the existing walking mechanics.)  In a few of these scenes I didn't even want to move close to the AI's path, but I was still held in place and it was immersion breaking.
-When fighting you have to stand in one spot.  This one is a HUGE problem. For the cutscenes it was a bit akward but no harm done.  When fighting a giant robot with a sword I wanted to dodge back, or jump forward to attack.  My physical space has enough room to do this. The game wouldn't let me.
-at one point you have to cut a bunch of stuff that is ""in your way""... but I climbed over similar stuff just before that and there was a gap to climb over it... why can't I climb?  Then there was a vertical pipe you are supposed to cut... but it has small platforms to the sides you can shimmy around so why do I need to cut it?

2022-05-28 11:17:30.402161,Blastphomy,Not as exciting as reviewers have said,"I'm a little disappointed as there is not too much utilization of the controllers, it is mostly cutscenes what you experience. You get to hold a saber, but never truely fight with one. Well,technically you use it when practicing with the bot, but it is pointless teaching you how to use it if you never really use it in game(apart from the dojo missions and reflecting beams from troopers). The graphics are realistic relative to other vr titles. But what really killed the experience for me was the game-length(less than an hour). I was hoping it would at least be an experience I would want to get back to, but I dont. This game had the same vibes from Arkham Knight vr, stunning visuals, decent mechanics, but finishes in less than an hour most of the experience being used trying to teach you how to use the mechanics. I would've rather spend $60-40 on a full game with a fufilling story(and maybe a multiplayer feature) rather than pay another $10 to continue it, it sort of reminds me of metal gear survive.  I would generally not reccommend this game or the games that follow it since it does not seem to be that fun or appealing of an experience. But if you are a hardcore starwars fan, go for it, there definitely is a story element to it, but you are left with a somewhat disappointing cliff hanger in the end. One more thing, something as action packed as the starwars franchise, I would expect the gameplay to be intense, but it honestly deserves that rating of comfortable as you really dont do anything that would get you on the edge of your seat.","Jan 13, 2020 at 9:02 AM",2, 2,

2022-05-28 11:17:33.537900,Masamoon,Fantastic VR experience,"Most of the reviews I see complain about how ""short"" the game is. I will agree that the campaign is short when compared to your standard full-length game, but it is not market as such, and is clearly part 1 in an ongoing series. Furthermore, if you actually try to get 100% on all of the dojo missions, it will take you a long time, and lots of sweat. I got episode 1 on launch day and to this day Im still working on those missions trying to get all 3 stars on all of them. (I also play maybe 2 or 3 times a week for about an hour or 2 if you want to compare what you would typically play)

I have never felt more immersed in a Star Wars experience before this and I am seriously super excited to see where the rest of the episodes go (Loving episode 2 as well). If you have the imagination and dedication, you will get out of this game what you put in. For example: (Super nerd warning) another thing I do to add an extra layer of fun for myself, is trying to do the stages in different Jedi ""Stance"" and Saber ""holds"" (1 arm behind the back, standard grip, fencing style - two-handed style - overhand grip like Starkiller in Force Unleashed, etc. etc.)

2022-05-28 11:17:36.663149,Wzky,A Great Purchase,"So, depending on how you play the story will take about 40m - 1hr 20m, it's not a long lasting story, but this is only episode one. The story is pretty good and the way it's done is incredible, I dislike the ZO-E3 (your droid friend) but otherwise the characters are interesting, it's canonical lore-wise, and is a great experience, honestly better than like 4 of the actual movies, assuming you play all the episodes.
There's a Dojo mode where you are pit in I think 40 different challenges slowly getting harder, with plenty of rewards (including for your Oculus Home). It's honestly the reason the game is worth the price, I only just made it to challenge 15 after about 5-6 hours of playing the dojo.
So for me, it I've gotten plenty of time out of it already to justify the purchase, and can't wait to try complete every challenge with max rating to get every reward I can.
That's not to mention, you can put your family members on it too so they can experience Vader's beautiful booming voice.

Only gripe I have is that in some scenes it was a bit *too* dark, I could sort of see what was happening, but being a bit brighter would've been nice. The final portion was hard for me to fight because I couldn't even see the lightsabers properly in the dark, but that might be just me, as my brother could see them just fine.

He speaks and you feel yourself avoiding eye contact as you do not want to upset this man.  From that moment on, I did not even realize that an hour had flew by me.  Which brings me to the fact that I cannot give this that fifth star, 56 minutes and I was done with the story and on to level 5 or 6 in that training room.  I guess it was only $10 but $10 an hour is barely an acceptable wage to survive on in real life so why would it be accpetble in a virtual world?  If this had more substance I would rate higher.  I will be purchasing the next two games but if they are as short as this, I would recommend waiting until they are on sale.  $5 is about the max amount of money I would ever suggest spending on these games.  If I were on Steam with this, I would have requested a refund almost immediately after closing the app.  That is weird to say seeing as how I loved it so much but replay is very low other than to show your friends Vader in VR.","Jan 8, 2020 at 11:48 AM",4, 0,

There is a rigid nature to the game that really makes it just feel plain and like a 1 dimensional show. As a Star Wars fan, this was dissapointing. On top of that, though the plot seems to follow an interesting thread, the game ends up feeling more like a demo than an episode as it ends shortly after about 40 minutes and most of the time you have to spend it listening to your annoying droid companion (the least likeable droid in Star Wars, I swear).

2022-05-28 11:17:46.194238,SpaceBeaver,Massive disappointment,"Make no mistake, this is not a game. This is a VR ""experience"" with mediocre interactions completely on rails. The only positive things I can say are the graphics, lighting, etc are pretty good and the story is somewhat interesting. Aside from that it's a complete waste of time IMO. If you are interested in a universal studios style experience / performance / ride then you will probably enjoy it.

Gamers looking for an actual interactive game should look elsewhere. It's entirely on rails with the least amount of freedom I've seen in any VR game (or any game at all for that matter). Battles are totally stationary and poorly designed. Deflecting lazer blasts with your light saber is totally canned and choreographed. Angles make no difference as far as I can tell. You can hold your light saber completely stationary and one lazer blast will bounce off at a steep angle while the next will bounce directly back at the enemy and kill them because that’s the story timing programmed in. You can’t even die as far as I can tell. During the final battle I completely avoided using any defensive moves or blocks and just spammed the enemies while taking several strikes from each and the game just continued on as if I was a dummy on a stick. Speaking of that battle your part in it was a total distraction from a much more entertaining display that was going on right across the room from you but you’re too busy trying to aimlessly swat away the static enemies to either side of you to be able to enjoy it. From what little I caught it seemed like the other action was motion captured and rendered for the game. All that effort felt wasted because you felt like you had to keep turning to the side and ”fighting” your direct enemies. A total waste.

Finally the whole experience is just flat out boring. I spent 90% of my time frustratingly waiting for the level to progress at the artificial pace they engineered to stretch the game out. If they actually allowed you to move at your own pace the","Dec 28, 2019 at 10:21 AM",2, 1,

Looked at as traditional game, it would be too short, too often block your free movement, just has no challenge at all in story mode (light saber dojo mode has challenge and is more like a traditional game mode).
But after playing the episodes some, it became clear to me that this is not intended to be a game in the traditional sense at all. This is intended to be a fan fantasy fullfillment theme park experience, and as that, it is pretty great, if not excellent.
Graphics and Audio are in a class of their own, very few VR and non VR games and movies come close to this production quality level.
The story and duration is short for usual game standards, but not too short at all when looked at as cinema movie or theme park film.
Basically it is one cinematic moment after the other, never longer than 3-5 minutes doing the same thing. Like as if they made a checklist of what type of Star Wars big cinematic moments could we all have in there, and then they added them all and put one after the other every few minutes. There is a story, with some a bit cheesy worn out moments, some great moments, but to me since i could not stray far from the path nor have branching story choices and the scenery and tasks change constantly, it felt more like the story is there to have a reason to move you from one great Star Wars set piece to another than a world and story one explores freely.
So yeah, if you're looking for a game with constant free movement, challenge etc (in the main story mode, too, not ""just"" in lightsaber dojo), then you may be disappointed. If you  want a great Star Wars theme park experience, this is hands down the best thing one can have in that field at home right now and really pretty amazing if one thinks about being able to have a theme park experience on this very high visuals, audio and immersion level at home now.

True, many gamers criticize the lenght, but I prefer a short and thrilling episode over a long and boring one.
The game is extremely storydriven and thus, sometimes limits your freedom to explore, sometimes even to move. And somehow the smooth 'turning around' didn't work.
But those are the only negative points and the positive ones outweighs them by far. This is not just an exemplary VR experience, but a love letter to all Star Wars fans. Most impressive are the giant Hollywood-style sets in combination with claustrophobic narrow corridors and passageways.

I've only had my Rift S for a couple of weeks and bought this because it's relatively cheap and i wanted something to test my set up (controllers sticking). Well I have to say this game kind of throws any flatscreen SW game in the shade. Landing on the planet in an imperial hangar at the begining was awesome, I was in a New Hope or Retun of the Jedi when they land on the death star.
So much of this game is immersion and atmospheric that i feel people overlook it. Then there's the lightsaber which was ****ing awesome! Fighting alongside Vader? Do I need to tell you how great that was?
I haven't played to the end yet but sure it may be short yet the quality of this game makes it an experience not to be missed. To be frank any future SW game will be compared to this in my mind and if it's not VR then forget it, today Vader Immortal is my favourite SW game (and I've played many over the years).

And that´s it. Between all this there is a non-story, a companion who gives jar-jar a run for most annoying ever, and clumsy navigation (sometimes the game freezes you, sometimes it seems to be bugs that stops you).

Having to be limited to moving behind the irritating droid is the worst. The custom settins are hard to configure and reset if you accidently switch to standard.

- Sometimes the droid's saber pass through your defense.
- Lightsabers tend to clip on the enemy's saber. No much of a bad thing, but it shouldn't happen.
- Level 9 has not enough time to be finished, and it's frustrating. Too much droids, little time. All the other levels are ok. Even level 50 is fine.

Perhaps I was spoiled after just having got done playing Lone Echo, but I've played multiple games with no issues like this one...

It's very jarring. For example: if you're scaling a wall, and a piece of the building is sticking out and your headset goes ""through"" it, instead of an in-game notification/pointer, simply not letting your character's head go that for, or other solutions, Vader Immortal completely removes the gameplay scene and places an arrow on screen on a 2-D plane vaguely pointing which way you need to move your head to continue the game. 

The game is very picky about where you're standing in-game, too. Using the former example, you're walking on a ledge on the outside of a building, and the wall is to your right. Some of the geometry gets in the way, the game is removed from your screen and replaced with an arrow saying to move left. You take a careful step left, and even if you slightly rock back too far to the right as you're adjusting your position, it again removes the game and you see the arrow again.

I wanted so badly to get immersed in Star Wars. Some of the scenery that you could look around was breathtaking. But the pickiness of the game regarding your positioning is overwhelming and while the story experience is only about 45 minutes for most people, I have quit playing twice within 35 minutes of gameplay. It's that infuriating. The issue is so glaring and I cannot think of a better way to ruin immersion than what this game does.","Oct 18, 2019 at 12:07 PM",2, 2,

This version is NOT ported from the Quest - this is the original and extremely high-end version which was cut down to fit the Quest. The level of polygons are off the charts, and that's why you'll need a high-end cpu to run this game (I'm using an i7 7700K). Vader has so many polygons he simply looks real - he's tall - standing right next to you - as if you were truly there. The movies can't give you such an experence, thus this game/experience is better than the movies ;-) Textures are highly detailed, you're not really going to find better textures anywhere, this is an AAA VR experience. It's short though, but the level of work it must have taken to make this is truly incredible. This is a must-have for the Rifts. Black levels on the CV1 are great, and I didn't notice the SDE, so the Oculus Jedi Masters probably helped the devs to get everything perfect. Forcing super sampling (ss) 2.0 using Oculus Tray Tool made everything look ultra-sharp even structures and buildings more than 100 meters away. But using ss 2.0 was expensive, I got 45 fps on my heavily oc'ed GTX 1080, but it was no big deal - thanks to ASW 2.0. For this experience image quality is way more important than solid 90 fps. 16GB system ram worked OK, I don't think having less than 32GB is a problem. Sound using the CV1 headphones was awesome - like being in a theater. Controls were fine, but this is more like a VR movie than a game. Some tutorials were designed for right-handed persons, and I'm left-handed, but I managed. You get an error when you're too close to walls, which the devs could have done better, but again it's no big deal.

Some parts of the game happen in the dark, and it's really annoying if you have a Rift S with an LCD display, because the residual light ruins it. Best played on the Quest / CV1 I guess. I really liked the lightsaber sequences when dueling, but I really disliked deflecting laser rays from stormtroopers. Some nice clues with amazing interaction mechanics there and there. But that's mostly 10 euros for one hour, plus teh dojo to play with the lightsaber. This one is so well implemented that I strongly suggest to buy at least one SW episode to try it out, but it will take better ropes to have my buy another one.","Oct 16, 2019 at 6:43 AM",3, 0,

For replayabilty there is the dojo mode, which has your traditional jedi-style training. However, no force powers yet! The dojo mode could be a game on it's own merit and makes the rest of the game worth while.

2022-05-28 11:18:40.094348,Tygron,Overhyped,"So it took forever for me to get this that the second episode came out. And my first impression of this game has left me wondering why the hype? I kept hearing about how cool this was and how excited people were for the next episode that I figured it had to be pretty cool. It was not.

So there's a few cool set pieces in here, and a few cool moments. But that's really about it.

Lets start with the first problem, 45 degree snap turning. Not only that but some of the worst snap turning i've experienced in VR. It doesn't start centered up, and then it continues to just decide where front is every few moments. Then I started noticing the incredibly small bounding box telling me to return to the play area. First off I can't see the play area, and the arrow that supposedly tells me where it is is incorrect. So here I am now standing as stiff as possible trying to stay within this arbitrary accepted zone just so I don't accidentally stick my head through a wall.

Then we got the climbing mechanic. How you get worse than someone's thrown together climbing test in Unity I couldn't tell you, but this sucks.

The AI ""companion"" is annoying and only serves to be in my way and slow me down to make the experience last longer. And if there is enough space to move around them the game just does not let you.

Then there's the robots you fight at the end of the game where they telegraph their attack but don't actually help you figure out which direction or angle it's gonna go. I'm not actually sure it's possible to fail or die, but it's still frustrating feeling like i'm supposed to kill a certain amount before I can continue and i'm getting hit. You don't want to die, but it feels like you're gonna die.

And then it's over. Maybe about 30 minutes, and it's over. I have no interest in the dojo.

I don't know if people call this a game, but it's really more of a little experience like you could have at Disney World waiting in line for the attaction to actually start. Refunding.","Oct 6, 2019 at 10:36 AM",2, 0,

2022-05-28 11:18:43.205179,S1MONSAYS,A great experience!,"Wow, just wow. 

I've tried alot of recommended titles such as Lone Echo, Robo Recall,  Arizona Sunshine, Job Simulator and Super Hot. And i feel like this one should not be overlooked. Some people complain about the length though not factoring in the price and the replayvalue in the lightsaber Dojo, where you have 120 stages of enemy waves that you have to defeat.

I think this game/experience alone is the one to show to your friends/family who have not yet played VR and want to try it. Almost everyone know StarWars, and can relate to some of it. 

I think for pure visual eyecandy this is the game try out, and also hands and interactive objects feel sooo good in this one. Up there with the big ones like Lone Echo.

Although the game might not be that long of an experience its great to have in your library just to quench you lightsaberthirst now and then. Also you feel like THE BOSS with an ""actual"" lightsaber in you belt when you're following the path of the story. I dont know how many times i equipped/unequipped my lightsaber turning it on and off. They nailed that bit. And swinging it deflecting lazers, fighting robots is just as satisfying.

There’s just also a lot of immersion breaking moments. Like if you walk too close to a wall it goes black and tells you to get back into the map. Also it makes you walk slow and jitters if you’re walking too close to someone. Also using the force is clunky and weird to me.

2022-05-28 11:18:46.415752,gerasmus,Meeting Darth Vader !  But Too Short,"This is the type of VR game that I've been craving for, interactive story driven VR game. Meeting Darth Vader was an immense experience, especially because he was so tall. The voice, Vader inspired power and confience. I'll pay $40 for something like this with 20 hours gameplay in VR. 
This is the game can sell VR headsets, that I would ask friends to buy. 
Pro:
* Meet and be dwarfed by Darth Vader in person!
* Swing a light saber !
* Music and atmosphere, wow.
* Impressive scenery, especially looking down from outside the Dojo.
* Being INSIDE the SW universe !
* End scene could have been more interactive, longer and more varied. 

Cons:
* Only 40 minutes (even less) all over. 
* No replayability, linear. Once finished you're not coming back.
* More interaction with environment. For example ability to pick up/drop/slice the random pieces of scenery lying around.
* Disable rumble on touch controllers, it wastes battery storage.

Worth $10 ? Yes!
Recommend ? Yes !
Most of the Vr games i tried up to now was naff VR tech demos, tower/rail shooters and no real story driven game. This game prooves that it can be different, and seeing the VR line up at Oculus Connect 6 to me it looks like VR could be heading to where consoles was in/around 1985. Huge growth coming.

* I'm not  a Star Wars fan, the SW analgue (buttons, dials, switches 1970's) tech is not my thing. Personally my tech needs to be more achieveable future tech from authors like Alastair Reynolds - ""House of Suns"", Greg Bear - ""Anvil of Stars"", Stephen Baxter - ""Proxima"" and Peter Hamilton's 'Confederation' series of books.","Sep 30, 2019 at 2:26 PM",5, 0,

I am using locomotion because I no longer get motion sick but I was able to walk through walls and then greeted with a pitch black screen saying ""Please move back into the world""

The saber fighting was okay only you can't actually move and just stand there blocking the same 2-4 strikes and after that its your turn to do 2-4 strikes. meanwhile in the back there is vader doing all sorts of epic sword moves.

(Rift S Video Impressions and Comparisons coming very soon!)

Initial Thoughts:
On the Rift S this is by far the greatest Star Wars experience I have played in VR.
I'm pleased to say this does not feel like a Quest port and more like the otherway round. The atmosphere, immersion, models and sets were all are stunning, and for a Star Wars fan like me, it felt like I was in a Star Wars movie. (A dream come true)
We've had a few FREE teasers over the years with 'Trials On Tatooine' and 'Droid Repair Bay' but this feels like the main course. 
The game is around 40 mins long and leaves you wanting more. This is a great experience to show your friends and new people to VR just how powerful and immersive VR can be.
For those of you seeking more of a challenge after, the Dojo recreates the classic Star Wars scene from 'A New Hope' where Luke Skywalker is practicing his skills with the lightsaber combat droid.
I have never tried the Star Wars Void experience but I have heard this is the closest thing and also a spin-of? How true this is I don't know.... but I do know the companion droid is the same one as used in the Void.
Parts 2 and 3 of this experience are still to come and I can't wait. I hope they add blasters!!!!","Jun 21, 2019 at 5:18 AM",5, 206,

Yes, it's short, but its qulity graphics, acting, and writting - beautiful, immersive, and just plain well done. I am nowhere near as much of a SW fan as I used to be, but the feeling of stepping into that universe is very well achieved here. 

Then, there is the lightsaber dojo. When I first played it, I thought it was just a mini game where you blocked the little blaster drones (like the one Luke trains with aboard the Falcon in ANH). Gradually however the rounds get harder and harder with a variety of combat droids piling on. The 'saber feels fantastic, and the mix of defense and attack is very good and can be quite a workout at the higher levels. Easily comparable to the best wave-based games like Space Pirate Trainer. Also, if yu purchase it for Rift, its available to you on Quest as well, as I found out when I logged in to my Oculus account on the Quest at work. 

As opposed to other reviews here, I think its an excellent value. I'd have given it about 3 1/2 to 4 stars for the core game, but throwing in the cross-compatibility and the hours I've sunk into the saber dojo, its an easy 5 for me.","Sep 12, 2019 at 10:03 AM",5, 1,

I don't want to spoiler anything but be sufficient to say that the first moment you'll meet the Sith Lord you'll understand that the money were well spent.

Game mechanics are enjoyable, lightsaber works well, great scenarios (to be a VR game), no force yet (Episode II will have it) but in game characters are interesting and well played. The story itself is interesting and can fit in the Star Wars universe. Aside from the story mode, you'll find also the ""arena mode"" where you'll have the possibility to use the lightsaber against multiple droids in many levels with increasing difficult (you will ""sweat"", is that the word right? Hopefully you get what I'm meaning).

The story part is short, no doubt, but it's just the first episode of three. I bought it for 10 euros (full price, wait for a discount if possible): if the remaining two episodes will cost the same, you'll get the first and worthy Star Wars VR game for 30 euros (and most of the ""big"" games in the Oculus store cost the same if not more).

I have always wanted to be IN the Star Wars universe, and this game provided that for me. I felt like I was at Disney's Galaxy's Edge park, even though I have yet to visit. I love this game and while it is short at about 35-40 minutes, it is worth every penny of the $9.99 price tag. I can't wait for Episode 2!","Sep 4, 2019 at 6:30 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 11:19:05.380398,Falcon5ky,"Good story, Unimpressive gameplay","An overall just alright experience. Overall I was unimpressed by just the first episode. The story is very much its strong suit, the grand visuals of the setting adding to the immersive experience. Unfortunately, the episode ends before getting too far into the story leaving it feeling like a $10 demo. 

The controls are where the game lacks even more in my opinion. First off, the game doesn't have any sort of truly smooth turning that I found. There is an option, but all it does is add in frames where your view snaps between set angles. Also, the ""return to world"" thing completely breaks immersion. Maybe it would have been better to simply add collision and make the player slide back a little instead of plunging the player into darkness with text on the screen.","Sep 7, 2019 at 4:12 PM",3, 0,

 When you first jump in you get a almost janky menu. the first couple minutes of the game are dull which I think they could have done better. 
Once you get into the base the game gets so much more enyoable and fun! I really got immersed and the way you have to break locks to open doors is just awesome. Fighting mechanics are really fun too, however I do believe that the fighting scene towards the end could have been better made. Not that theres anything wrog with the mechanics I just think fighting the same type of robot over and over again is boring. When you reach the end it honestly feels rushed. That sucks.

Although it was pretty short it was amazing. The experience is around one hour and a half if you explore and look at all the awesome details. Although i'd like some more mechanics with the Light saber like to be able to slash some random props and pipes would make the game much more enjoyable instead of only doing that when being told to.

Also moving around via control stick teleporting is so cheap and removing from the immersion. Also they don't even let you activate that control until all of the dialogue is finished per scene but constantly you're like 3 steps ahead of the action in your mind so you don't want to wait for the game to catch up with you.","Aug 30, 2019 at 3:28 PM",2, 0,

- Faaaaaar too short gameplay (~45 minutes) for the price! More of a demo than a game for sale.

- Very often too dark.

- Blocked movement during cinematic sequences. I prefer a confined space in which I can move like I want instead of being glued to a position.

- I had to play sitting instead of standing. While standing the in-game-head-position was too high (especially in the space ship in the beginning and in the tunnels) (I'm 1.90m tall). I looked down on Darth Vader! :-D  While standing I had to squat to reach the ship controls and I had too often a text overlay that directed me to move back. That really was a nuisance. Compare that to the movement in Lone Echo. And while sitting my arms were too wild for the light saber fight ;-)

- No dialog. The robot constantly talked to me without any option for me to talk back. I waited all the time for the robot to start complaining that I don't answer ;-) Even if dialog has no effect on the gameplay it would feel much more immersive if I could talk at least something back.

Overall it had its fun value but too many shortcomings. I hope for an episode 2 with less glitches and longer gameplay because the Star Wars feeling was there and I want to have more ;-)

For example, if I leaned my head forward into an object in the game, it would pop me out of the 3d world and display a text message to move backward.  This is separate from the experience of exceeding your playspace boundaries in the real world, which also happens from time to time.  But really?  I bump my head into a ladder, and I'm told to move backward?  Beyond that, the light saber had a lot of potential, but just felt strange... like I couldn't point it to where I wanted to, and moving within the room often didn't move me toward my opponent.

Lightsaber looks cool too! the audio reacts to how fast you move the lightsaber. Combining with the vibration from controller, it feels like you really are holding a lightsaber in your hand. I just wish there is more fighting in the story mode, but this is only the first episode of the story, so it makes sense.

The best part of the experience is the lightsaber dojo challenge. Being a fan I just had to work on it and It was very satisfyingpassed to be able to complete all 40 levels with top marks. There is a bit of random element to how the droids appear, so replaying the same level does not feel repetitive. 

As you progress through the levels, you do need to change how you play it.  There are a few strategies that you need to work out in order to get high marks. So you need to think about it when you play. If you are the type that just pick it up and expect to have fun, you may be disappointed.

Pros:
+ Light-saber handling is amazing: visuals, sound, controller feedback, parrying mechanics - everything is very satisfying. Light-saber is the perfect weapon for VR melee action: it's almost weightless and can cut through anything, solving both problems with immersion of VR slashers. I really hope they will add online multiplayer arena in next episodes
+ Main campaign is engaging and interesting despite lack of actual gameplay. It is a very promising beginning
+ The music is just perfect for Star Wars game

Cons:
- There are less immersion-breaking ways to stop player from clipping into objects than obnoxious warning screen
- Visuals are surprisingly less impressive than in a very spiritually similar experience Arkham VR. Looks like they were build around Oculus Quest's limitations and PC version didn't get enough polish","Aug 2, 2019 at 5:54 AM",4, 4,

But it's much shorter than that, I'd say about 20 minutes.  Odd, Oculus shows I played it 7 hours, but I only installed it about 2 hours ago so I'm not sure how that's possible.  At any rate even that 20 minutes is not very good. SPOILER ALERT:  You don't get to fight Darth Vader!  Even though he is figured front and center on the marketing with his light saber out, a clear marketing gimmick to get you excited to fight him, you do no such thing.  The fighting is pretty bad, the mechanics are very bare bones.  You basically block 2-3x to open up the opponent then slash, that's it and it's not even very accurate.  There is also returning gun fire, but it's also so inaccurate you just hope for the best. The last fight was so underwhelming, you fight waves of the exact same robots with the exact same moves with the same barely existent combat mechanics. 

It's a shame because this could have been really good, even as a 1 hour demo.  The graphics are excellent, the immersion is very good.  Although the immersion suffers greatly in those very frequent times when you are frozen in place listening to dialogue or waiting for something to happen.  There are some very cool rudiments of an awesome game here, but they are never realized. 

Look, if  you are ok spending the amount you probably pay for an expensive Starbucks cafe I don't blame you.  It's a very cool demo of VR, it's just a very shoddy ""game"" and not even a very good tech demo.","Aug 4, 2019 at 5:00 AM",2, 0,

Like watching a Star Wars movie, great graphics and good motion capture for the NPCs, very good voice acting. It's worth $10 to play the 40 dojo levels, but be aware while this is the least buggy VR game I've ever played, there are a few small bugs with detecting lightsaber blocks in later dojo levels.

(spoilers from here on out). the graphics were decent 7 out of 10. the sounds were solid 8 out of 10. the story is 10 out of 10 there is a lot they can do with it moving forward. the game-play mechanics were unfortunately subpar 5 out of 10. its almost 2020 if i hit a wall with my lightsaber i expect things to happen. nope clips right through. sometimes it leaves a little glow mark somewhat near where it was for half a second. some things you can cut some things you cant. the pipes that are obviously in your way cut right through the tiny little light post...nope. red faction had almost fully destructible environment in 2001!!! and i cant cut a broom handle with a lightsaber in 2020.

 the lighting is another issue in the final battle i found myself unable to see for most of it. the game itself crashed 3 times and glitched out 4 times where the screen went black and paused for about 10 seconds then jumped back in. the other catch is with the blaster energy bolt return, Its automatic. I would have much rather have it be based off of a collision angle then automatic, yes it would make the game harder but I want a game that is hard but rewarding.  if you could master manually returning blaster shots and your friends were fumbling around you would be the boss. All you have to do is hold the lightsaber in front of you and it will return bolts. That's lame. They could make it so that its an option in the difficulty settings. That would be cool.

and its just too short. even with the crashes and glitches, it only lased 40 min. they could have given us a taste of some force powers.

Story aside (because I think this isn't really about the story), this episode is about the introduction of the lightsaber and it's basic mechanics...and it's awesome.

The lightsaber looks, sounds and swings as beautifully as one could have hoped for. Deflecting blaster shots feel fun and authentic, it would be interesting to experiement with different speeds of blaster bolts though, maybe in a difficulty setting?

Even though there is no force feedback when clashing a saber with an enemy, the vibrational response and licensed sounds really go along way in provoking the imagination.The animations are nicely done and the melee mechanics are remarkadly solid.

The only time I ever really have ""OH COMON!?"" moments is an annoying glitch where a droid floating behind an standing enemy buzzez towards you from out of line of sight, flies through the enemy from behind (no collision) and strikes you by surprise.

For all the fun I've had going through the short story and mostly playing the lightsaber dojo (theres plenty of levels to complete, and a worthy challenge), it's definately worth $10. Anyone saying this is too expensive? A take-out can you cost you $10...I mean, come on...

I can't wait to finally use the spare hand with new force mechanics the next episode will hopefully bring. Keep up the good work!

 Just the occasional screen stutter, but nothing bothersome.

There is a lot to like about this and because of it's stable I didn't think twice about buying into it.  I wasn't disappointed with any of the content, the story is great as are the graphics.. they're super clean just like Lone Echo.  But it's so short.... :(  Although the Dojo is a cool idea that will keep me occupied for a while...

I'm guessing the devs have spent a shed load of time on the game infrastructure and mechanics etal and wanted to get it out there to see how its received and plays out on our rigs...  Well the take-up rate and reviews to-date tell that story and even tho i'm disappointed by the short prologue style i'm not giving it any less than 5 stars... Yes I could have waited for a sale but why would you for this type of content?

So I'm hoping this means that FUTURE EPISODES WILL BE LONGER (I'm channeling the force here) and be out soon like THIS YEAR because by then my Dojo training will be completed and I will be less waggly with my saber and more thoughtful about my parrying and blocking.. or is that block then parry? Hmmm yep it's that one.

As for replay value i'd say I have been back to some of the scenes but mostly to see what messing with Vader would do... like using my handy screwdriver thing to see if I could undo the bolts of his mask...  Now what would have been cool is if  Vader had reacted in some way (Like Liv does in Lone Echo)  That would have stopped me in my tracks...

Also, in the dojo, if I'm on a level and take a couple of hits and want to restart, and go to the menu and choose 'start round' it re-loads the map even if I am on the same map.  Unlike if you fail that map and choose the retry option, it just restarts and doesn't reload the same level.  Have a map check when start round is selected, so it doesn't need to reload the same map please.

Also wouldn't mind the light saber sound effects to be a touch higher.  I know you need to hear where opponents are coming from, but the heat of battle I don't hear it much.  Maybe just the hum even when it's startionary.  The saber almost goes completely silent.  I believe that's intentional, but I think a touch more hum would give it presense.  For example, moving the saber slowly from ear to ear didn't result in much hum.

EDIT: I try to rely on snap/smooth turning when available in games, as I have an injury that makes it difficult to phyiscally turn quickly.  I still end up doing it playing vr, but I try to minimize it where I can.  

Really been enjoying the dojo, and wanted to mention that while the current degrees covered for snap is fine for the single player game, it's not enough for the dojo. As in, one can't turn fast enough using snap to face an enemy that's not facing them.   A way to set 45 degrees or in this game in particular maybe 90 would be preferable. 

Btw, accessibility is a good reason to include snap/smooth as an option even on a mobile option like the quest.    I've never played the quest version of VI, so I'm not sure if snap options are available.  Oh and another reason is creeky floors.  I get complaints from others in the house with all the moving about late at night.  heh.","Jul 1, 2019 at 11:03 AM",4, 3,

The story part was amazing, if not short lived, but the lightsaber training is the real game. It was just challenging enough to keep me entertained, but not so much so that I got frustrated.

2022-05-28 11:20:02.696387,Mithros,"Extremely fun, one flaw","Let me start by saying I absolutely loved this game and it's easily worth the money.  Definitely get it.  The story is pretty short, but still fun, and given the cost I think it's a great setup for future iterations.  It's a little dark/foggy at times, but I get that it was originally made for the quest (I played it on the Rift S) so that was probably to help with hardware restrictions?  

The lightsaber training dojo is extremely fun, and especially once you get good at it on higher levels you feel like a complete bad@$$ and even get in some mild exercise in the process.  There is only one somewhat significant design flaw that can be pretty frustrating.  Completionists/people who just want all the lightsabers are going to want to 3-star each round, however unfortunately some of the rounds come down to blind luck in order for it to be possible.  You lose a star if you take too long, and sometimes (arguably most of the time on some levels) you just physically do not have enough time to get all 3 stars even if you do everything perfectly.  Either the droids don't attack quickly enough (and you cannot attack them yourself, only counter), or not enough of the floating balls spawn within reach (meaning you have to wait for them to attack).  This can lead to some frustrating levels where you have to run through them multiple times, perfectly each time, in the hopes that random luck will be on your side for the timing. 

Other than that, awesome game.  I'm definitely looking forward to the next one.","Jun 26, 2019 at 3:27 PM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 11:20:15.380465,Grey_Paladin,So much potential,"If you have ever wondered what it would be like to stand in Darth Vader's presence it is...chilling, to say the least. It is the fullfillment of a lifelong desire you didn't know you had; to stand face to face with the greatest villain in sci fi history. If only the game was long enough to enjoy it.
This game has so much potential, but it is far too short (especially considering th price). It screams ""demo"" when you thought you'd be getting at least a short game. The plot here is about as long as a first level for a bigger game, and feels like it.
(Though, if the Devs are planning more, or a larger game maybe they'd give discounts to people that bought this? Wink wink, nudge nudge).
I do hope there is more coming. Prefferably a big game or series of LONGER episodes that're more refined.
Some issues to note:
1. Finger movement does not work properly and during my entire playthrough my left thumb did not work at all. No fingers worked properly by the end.
2. The lightsaber and spanner tool feel too high up on the body and it makes grabbing them odd.
3. When starting the game or resetting the tracking everything is rotated 90* to the left.

Things this game (or others) need:
1. Dialogue options and ""character"" to the player would be nice and increase the immersion.
2. A ""universal north"" indicator under my feet so i can tell where I am facing relative to my setup.
3. The ability to rotate facing position when teleporting (like Robo Recall).
4. A peripheral enemy indicator (Say a red aura that appears on the edge of my vision) to show if there is an enemy where I can't see them).
5. Not to mention making the enemies in the ending battle ""take their turn."" I'm sure this is something you could get used to, but in a short game it just makes the last battle an awkward onslaught of not knowing who or what is attacking me. (Also they move slow so in the time it takes for them to get into range to attack one or two have walked over and are getting ready to attack).","Jul 14, 2019 at 10:32 AM",3, 0,

The graphics and sound are better than average, yes. And it's fun to hear the real actors voice the characters. But that's about it really on the positives.

I was constantly getting a notice about ""move head inside the world"". Sometimes at very confusing spots, like when I was fending off some storm-troopers while standing on a flying platform. No walls around and my feet were planted firmly in the middle of my playspace. And when I wasn't getting that annoyance, I was standing still. Waiting for the next thing to trigger. Waiting. Not doing or experiencing anything of interest. just waiting for the animation to catch up. Then I got a light-saber. And I thought. Wow. Now I might get to do stuff. No. Not really. At action scenes I am stuck at one point flailing the saber around fighting predictable enemies that telegraph moves from miles away. So I put my saber at the intended spot and just wait... again. Even in action scenes I wait. And then the final fight occurs and it's the worst one of all. Just wait. Parry left. Parry right. Do some damage. Rince and repeat. No progress is shown until *SPOILER* steps in and does my job for me. Great feeling of accomplishment I was left there.

So, if invisible walls, waiting, predictable quick-time-events and waiting and a few somewhat interesting settings, and waiting are your thing, then you may love it. Me? I just wanted to get it over with...","Jul 13, 2019 at 9:53 PM",2, 0,

It's such a shame that oculus are so crap and haven't released a next gen headset to show off the graphics, as they are very high production. Lighsaber feels great to use and the dojo is good fun.

Now the negatives:  I can't stand snap turn so was pleasantly suprised that this game has the option for smooth turn..but it doesn't work. You still snap turn, which is extremely frustrating as snap turn is really disorientating for me. It also has very lazy lcomotion where, if you go near a wall the screen just goes black and it tells you to move back. Not what you'd expect for a AAA title. Aside from that it's too short and not enough action. There's hardly any combat in the game until the end, then it just spawns the exact same droid over and over again to the point of frustration.

2022-05-28 11:20:28.136853,michael.lubuguin,Cool Star Wars Experience,"A very well polished ""STAR WARS Experience"" that lets you live out your fantasy of being in the Star Wars universe. Yes, as others have noted this is a relatively short overall experience (about 35 - 40 minutes) and the interactions are pretty simple (climb here, flip this switch, etc.), but the graphics, textures and 3D models are top-notch, and I found it worth the 10 bucks. I look forward to the next chapters (I hope the next chapter will let me use blasters). As for replayability, other than the lightsaber dojo mini-game (which is really fun BTW), only the most die-hard Star Wars fan will probably want to repeat the experience (personally I'll probably revisit this from time-to-time when the mood strikes me because it is really cool). Also it's a nice experience to show off your friends and family who are into Star Wars.","Jul 5, 2019 at 9:10 AM",5, 1,

I gave it four stars since it's a pretty short experience you get.  Do I see five star potential with it?  I think so, but we really need more story and much more game play.","Jul 7, 2019 at 3:47 AM",4, 0,

The game feels like a demo, at best a journey through the first chapter of a sttory where you get to act out a few lines and moves.  There is very little interactivity.  Movement is constrained to the scene.  Interaction is limited to pull that lever, press that obvious button or grab and pull on those specific pipes/ladders.  The highlight is waving a light saber about to deflect blasters or block/attack saber wielding droids.  And then it ends.","Jul 6, 2019 at 1:16 PM",2, 0,

Yes its only part 1 and if  you stretch it out and look at all of the great scenery you can push it to 45 min or a little more.   I am on an original Rift.  I did get stuck walking through a door.  and it seems like they keep you on a less free roam path then I would like.  However the imerrsion was fantastic.   This will bring out the kid  in anyone that ever wanted to fight with a lightsaber or fly on a ship..  The details were great.   They have settings for all types of VR experience,  you can turn on and off alot of how you move around.    I was so excited that there is a SMOOTH TURN option,  however I could not get it to work so I was able to walk around with the thumstick I could not spin with the other?    Im sure that will get patched..   Being a Star Wars fan I had so much fun. I cant wait for more of the story.  I hope they dont take a year between releasing.     Im sure I am not the only one thinking  that what needs to happen is a  MULTI-PLAYER  open galaxy game with this as a kick off point!

2022-05-28 11:20:34.464646,DanteRose,A True VR Experience,"Are you a star wars fan? Are you interested to hear another star wars story? Do you want to really explore the Star Wars Universe using a variety of Touch controls? If you didn't already click Buy by now, then you should have. I would rate this game a 4.5 if we could, but I round down and not up!

Pros:
The graphics and world look amazing. I have a great computer so of course that helps, but the amount of time they spent on items, ships, rooms impresses me. I haven't been impressed in awhile. 
The controls are easy to use and your using a significant amount of controls so that makes me happy to know I'm doing more than shooting a gun or swinging a sword.
The Story is where the money is though! I mean I was in shock by going through this storyline and CANNOT WAIT for the next chapter. Star Wars always has me engaged and their writers should continue to engage me.
Overall pros fall into the variety of touch controls being used, how immersive the world is and most importantly how much time they spent on the story!

Cons:
I had a few moments where it would tell me I needed to return to the world and I would say I was still on par with the route/map. I think this could be an easy fix.
It got repetitive towards the very end with fending off guardians. Perhaps providing a variation of enemies to do more.

Lastly, GREAT JOB ON VADER!!! Yes to all of that! I am nostalgic of the story of Star Wars and felt there was still room to grow on Vader's character.. so glad to see this return! Hurry up and take my money for chapter 2!","Jul 6, 2019 at 8:02 AM",4, 0,

Yes it is very short for the story mode but it is very well done and is worth the money if you enjoy star wars at all. You will love the experience.
One little thing I'd like to say is I hope the turning motion could be smooth and not have small snap turns, that in my opinion would make it so much better.

"" We have waited a very long time since Trials of Tatooine came out years ago, and IMO here we are with one of the best SW game of all time. Thank you very much developers, that you managed to create such an accurate environment, such a good lightsaber ""feel"". The story is very interesting, short (40-50 min. tops), but it's just episode 1, we are going to have 2 more. I've spent 2 hours in the dojo the first time i run the game (if you do it correctly, you are going to sweat...), it's also fun, it offers collectable lightsaber skins and crystals. When you play the dojo, toss away one of your controllers somewhere else in the room, and play with just the dominant one and grab that lightsaber in any style you want, and fight however you want.

2022-05-28 11:20:44.018664,Ruckusx,,"A series with large potential, though at present in this episode at least constricted by certain elements.

To start off, the immersive feeling is largely there. From the first scene to the descent on the smaller vessel, there is that familiar VR immersion we've come to love in great titles. Certainly helped by the impressive figure of Vader and the Admiral. However, certain scenes are ruined by unconvincing background 2D images, killing part of the immersion (largely the outdoors scenery). Second of all there's frequent instances where movement controls are taken away from the player and too often I somehow seemed to collide with the terrain and get the 'return the the world' bluescreen, even when simply trying to cross a 10cm gap, the same path the droid took before me.

Then there's the lightsaber scenes. Starting off well with the first opponent, although a little stiff and requiring a decent amount of whacking, it's a decent fight to be expected from an introduction to fighting in a new VR title. The second fight with the blasters had me smiling more and was a decent amount of fun. Unfortunately toward the end of this title, the fun in fighting largely fell apart and came about the stiff -no controls movement allowed- with very elaborate predictable patterns that became more of a nuisance and had me wishing to get the scene over with after the 4th or 5th wave, than to have it continue.  Maybe this approach was opted for to make the fights easier and accessible to a larger audience and children. 
More freedom in at least movement control, variation and perhaps a way to increase the difficulty through reduced reaction times and getting rid of some of these elaborate patterns, would go a long way in making the fights not so stiff and more enjoyable.
The sudden ending following those waves caught me a bit off guard, though obviously priced accordingly and with the dojo mode a good value for the money.

All in all a decent title with some future needed improvements.","Jul 3, 2019 at 4:54 AM",3, 0,

(1) at the startup of the game it makes you already have to go through a minute of logos that no one really cares about im sorry but no one that go the game wanting to play it like crazy and have fun on it wants to watch your logos for a full minute so instaed make it so players an skip it. (2) the setting up or the settings. did you know there is no smooth turning at least not that i caould find it because it was that hard to figure out the settings of the game lucky for me i had 360 degree movement or i would have had to use snap movement which btw when in combat is really hard to use. (make it have descriptions of what it does and maybe even make it so you can actually walk around at the menu area.) now that thats all i have on the games startup the gameplay wasnt to bad but has bugs and problems. for example when i first start i was in a black screen already being told by the game to move in a direction which was annoying becuase this kept popping up during the whole game i would be walking along in the game and oops to close to that ingame wall please wove this way. i was annoying and thats only 1. second walking did you know you cant walk into almost anything it the game or it will have you tell you to move or have you stuck unable to move at all making you have to move irl to fix it and if you have a small space good luck on that. now before i go into some more and have not ruined people exeperience already please go to my yt channel and ill go into way more detail at Bookaa Gaming","Jul 1, 2019 at 6:39 PM",2, 0,

It looks great, most of the interactions worked very good. So all fine on the technical side.
The Soundtrack fits very well and the voice over is also very good.
Apart from the technical side it gives you the opportunity to meet a legend of Star Wars, enjoy swinging a light saber and presents some awesome sights.
I am looking forward to the next episode. And in the meantime I will glimpse into this episode quite often.

Update: I played the episode two or three times more just fort the awesome views. But the light saber ""Mini Game"" in which you can fight against training devices have stolen quite more of my time.

The immersion is good but both story and gameplay are so short that a demo is in general longer than that. It's the first time that a Lucasart product is so disappointing.
There's not a lot to do in the game either. You just walk around a very limited map and you engage a couple of static and repetitive combats. When it seems that the game is finally starting it ends.
I hope the next episodes will be for free since I already paid for this joke.","Jun 27, 2019 at 4:55 AM",1, 2,

This game has so much potential.  I would love if it were longer.  As it is, it's more like a demo than a game with only 35 minutes of gameplay.  The Dojo es a wonderful place to practice and they should add actual Jedis and improve on sword mechanics.

2022-05-28 11:20:57.134926,AsmoNZ,Overrated,"I read quite a few reviews before I purchased this, with fairly high expectations based on that. In reality though, I was actually pretty keen for the whole thing to end, and luckily it's short so that wasn't a problem.

It's just very boring. The main part of it is the Lightsaber, and that is basically on-rails fighting where you either defend by blocking top left corner, top right corner, or the sides.....then the enemy puts down their defenses and you swing twice to attack. 
That's it. Everytime.
The other mechanic is deflecting these strangely slow moving laser bullets, which deflect back to objects on rails too.

The combat is so so shallow that I won't bother playing it again. Lucky it's so cheap, because this is an awful VR game from what it could have been in my opinion.","Jun 30, 2019 at 3:11 PM",2, 0,

Completed the single player story mission in about 50 minutes. Then there's the extra dojo wave game which apparently can last upto 3 hours which is cool.

Really enjoyed this. I will give it 5 stars but there is two points I would like to make.

First of all the movement is a bit restricted in some areas both with teleport or free movement. Even for experienced users it seems a bit clunky, so this could be better.

And secondly they seem to have gone overboard with the comfort settings. I don't like it when the screen goes black when I teleport. It messes with my eyes. Is there anywhere to turn this off?

Also when I rotate with analogue stick it doesn't rotate enough, is there any way to increase the distance you rotate?

The story and gameplay was amazing though. Can't wait for next episode!

Also the Lightsaber combat looked and felt great too.

And lastly the graphics, visuals and sounds were all great although some scenes seemed a bit too dark to me. It would be good if they added an option for brightness.","Jun 21, 2019 at 8:05 PM",5, 5,

At the end of the game you're battling some droids and it keeps popping up the message even though you're in the middle of an empty space and it's very annoying considering you're trying to fight enemies.

Also there are some mechanical and gameplay flaws:
- Give the player more freedom, let him teleport around at free will (inside the current playable area). Also let him kill his companions (with the lightsaber) and just do a restart from the last seconds. Let him interact with more random stuff, that he can throw etc.
- The lightsaber blocking feels sometimes a bit strange, I feel that detected blocks should not have worked and the other way around.
- The probably biggest problem was the ""Move back into the world"" error, I often got it when I was pretty sure I didn not leave the world. Also I took me some experimentation to get what it ment at all. An implementation like in Budget Cuts would have been better, there you see a colorless grid of the world, it helps to understand where you're stuck in.
- All in all the game was too dark, maybe this was on purpose to hide bad textures or something, but for an VR game it really is cool to see the world around you. 

That despite that much flaws I gave 3 stars shows how much I liked the game concept and also many parts where quite immersive. But there really needs to be some work done to improve it.","Jun 30, 2019 at 9:25 PM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 11:21:03.609381,YoeyYutch,Lightsaber Dojo Review (Level 1-16),"In addition to the 30-45 minute single player mission, the game offers a secondary ""Light saber Dojo"" in which you wield your light saber to attack and defend yourself from wave after wave of droid robots, 120 levels total. Initially you face off against waves of blaster-equipped flying droids (see Marksman-H combat remote). Each level their strength and numbers increase with new droids being introduced periodically (3 types in levels 1-16) presenting new challenges fending off different types of attacks simultaneously. 

My thoughts:
Overall this can be fun and dramatically extend the amount of gameplay. New droids keep the gameplay fresh and peak my curiosity so I want to continue to unlock levels and new droids. However there are two big problems that almost completely ruin it for me.

1. LIGHTSABER TOO BRIGHT! CAN'T SEE INCOMING ATTACKS.
As levels become more difficult this becomes a major frustration fending off blaster bolts from different directions especially the close range shots.  Please consider reducing the glow of the saber and possibly increasing the brightness of blaster bolts.

2. DISPLAY GOES BLANK WHEN YOU LEAN TOO FAR WITH NO WARNING.
This is a poor practice for VR game design. It's like sneaking up on someone and putting a blindfold on them. If you must enforce the rule that that the player stays within the hexagon boundary regardless of their playspace size, then please consider an alternative solution. I suggest a simple proximity warning. As you approach the boundary the display glows (some color) then transitions to red when you go out of bounds causing one hit of damage each second until you are back in bounds.","Jul 1, 2019 at 1:24 AM",3, 2,

The visuals are good and I'm sure they are even better on the Rift S. Also, the sounds are spot on which is essential for anything Star Wars. However, this game was mostly a let down for me. I can look past the short length since it is only ten dollars but I expected more interaction with the environment and I was certainly not expecting to be restricted as much as I was. You can't really get lost in the experience because it is constantly forcing you to stay in one place which was really frustrating. Moreover, it's a bummer that your hands go through the walls and every object. Even worse is that if you put your head through anything you are shown a screen that tells you to move back. Unfortunately, all of this really detracts from the overall experience. I also found the combat to be extremely boring. I'm sure it will get better with the next episodes but being locked in one place while enemies repeat the exact same moves from the same sides over and over is a shame.

2022-05-28 11:21:13.230208,SDC-Wutang,First Run,"My exception to everyone's comments is that I find the allowed play-space to be super small and jarring when it comes to combat.  The display goes black and tells me to step back constantly.  Between that and my guardian boundary warnings, it was very jarring and confusing to know where I am in space.  This caused me to hit my hand pretty hard on one of my floor speakers.  I've been playing in this VR space for almost a year now so it's nothing new.  Here's the thing: the play space this title allows is much smaller than my guardian boundaries.  It not a big deal until saber combat.  The moment you duck or dodge out of the the play space the display goes black with a warning to get back in your space.   Meanwhile droids are swinging on you and you're blind.  What you end up doing is trying to manage combat, the play space, and your guardian space so you don't go blind.  It's very immersion breaking.  

I must say that's it's an overall good experience and worth the $10.  There's much more to this title than combat and it is not exactly a game.  But immersion should still be a priority.  I hope any immersion breaking elements can be updated.  

This was a first run and I ran everything on default.  Will try the 360 mode and report back.

Update:  I played it again seated and it seems to make much more sense as I didn't have to worry about stepping out of bounds and could just enjoy the storytelling.  However, during saber combat I did break boundaries twice just by leaning.  I'm referring to the last chapter.

I've done The Void twice and this experience is more akin to that than say Battlefront 2.  It's by all means a guided experience rather than an RPG or first person combat experience.  If you're looking for great Saber combat this is NOT it.

It isn't as quite as immersive in the beggining, but you do a lot of stuff that is pretty cool. My only (non-spoiler) complaint would be that this was $10, but the main story was only approximately 40-50 minutes. However, (if I remember correctly), Oculus' Refund Policy allows you to return a game under 2 hours of playing it. So you can do the story and then return it if you want.

You get to use a lightsaber, as well as this tool to hotwire doors and stuff. You also end up climbing a good amount of ladders, as well as walking around edges (hella realistic). The lightsaber combat is pretty cool, but you don't get to do a lot of it, and in the duels that you do, you can't really move around too much. Once again, I really dislike how the main story was only about 40-50 minutes long. There is a sort of challenge mode that you can do besides the campaign, but that kinda bored me after 15 minutes.

2022-05-28 11:21:19.563927,Alextended,,"This is a passable adventure with limited gameplay and interactivity. You would expect to see it in some location VR experience so that everybody who paid for the hour can go through the whole thing.

It's a lot like a Lone Echo knock off by a less talented developer with some combat sequences. The production values are good in some ways but in others it lacks polish.

Progress only triggers if you stand on very specific points indicated by a marker, which harms immersion.

There's no smooth turning (an option like that in the settings just makes it so the snap-turn has a smooth rotation animation, it's still a preset angle turn, it's just not an instant step of the camera but an animated gradual one).

The VR hands have slow animations for the different gestures (like pointing or closing to a fist or when they assume a position ready to grab an interactive object you hover over) rather than respond instantly like Oculus Home (or Lone Echo or other game) hands.

There's a tool you can use in the game, basically an electric screwdriver, where when you hold it in your hand you can press the trigger and see it spin up yet when you use it on applicable objects it automatically spins up and unscrews the thing without a press.

Stormtrooper laser blasts you can deflect travel way too slow, slower than the drone blasts in the dojo, it looks off.

There are gameplay flaws and such inconsistencies all over, even in the okay lightsaber combat.

The story has inconsistencies too. Vader says at one point that he senses the force within you. Which is cool, but you've been using a lightsaber for a while which you'd think would have made it obvious.

The game also stutters here and there regardless of being in low or high settings (there's nothing else) on an i7 3770K and GTX1080.

If you want to get a Quest game for PC, I suggest Journey of the Gods instead. It's not without issues but it's a complete polished experience with meaty gameplay, not an unpolished tech demo like this.","Jun 24, 2019 at 7:04 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 11:21:19.587863,Sponticore,On the rails VR,"VR is about experimentation, this is a long call of duty cutscene. Its pretty cool to be inside the starwars universe with lifesized aliens and lightsabers and such but you are constantly reminded you are an observer with very minor freedoms.

First game that made me notice poor black levels in my Rift S. Other games look fine but this one is super washed out. Even for my friends who are mega starwars fans I dont think I would show them this due to the poor visual quality. Also, whats up with the worst landscape skybox in existence? It looked worse than a revist to half-lifes cliff scene skybox.

Next episode needs more freedom, more content, improved visuals.","Jun 27, 2019 at 1:33 AM",2, 1,

The only thing missing is the other episodes, which is why it only gets 4 stars. the story is on par with alot of other star wars games. One in particular is The Force Unleashed. There are no reasons why we cannot get this level of detail on the scale of Skyrim VR. Something like that would sell more headsets in an instant.

Positives:
Not bad graphics
VR interaction (available) was reasonably impressive - i felt some feedback and weight to some of the heavier interactions, like turning a heavy metallic object.
Frickin' light sabres were awesome but you can't really mess that up.
A clear and interesting-ish Storyline. 

Negatives: 
Limited interaction with the environment - a little too structured and you couldn't just walk around and have a good explore.
Would have been fun to fire some laser guns.

2022-05-28 11:21:25.911663,FatherFenix,"Awesome, but Short...","My initial thought was ""$10? How?!""

But then I completed the story in, maybe, an hour. It's a great, highly-detailed Star Wars VR experience that makes good use of the technology and adds what seems to be leading into a really cool story within the Star War universe. Maya Rudolph is a fun semi-narrator as ZOE3, with some decently funny banter; and Steve Blum as Karius is a really cool-looking (and sounding) new bad guy. Only notches against it would be the short length, even for an episodic game; and the annoying habit for the game to jar you out of the experience with a ""Return to Scene"" screen if your head bobs even a little out of where it wants you. For example, when climbing certain pipes in a certain scene, the natural movement of the character kept throwing me into the ""Return to Scene"" screen despite being more or less on-rails.

So...really cool intro experience for $10, tons of detail and atmosphere, but the only downside is really just the extremely short length.","Jun 26, 2019 at 11:15 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 11:21:25.957540,Jollyrolls,Mediocre game that satisfies a fandom,"It is nice to have a proper Star Wars game.  However, being Star Wars and episodic in nature does not justify what is a pretty substandard game.  There is a lack of smooth turning (what is labelled as such in the menu is just a different snap turn).  The game is exceptionally dark which does not lend itself well to the Rift-S.  Also there are many ""events"" in game where you are locked in spot.  If you move your head where the game does not like it pops up a black screen telling you to return to play area.  This really pulls you out of what immersion there is in a 30-40 minute walking simulator.

Edit - Any attempt to refund the game fails for me.  It looks like under categories Vader Immortal is classified as a movie which would make it ineligable for refunds.","Jun 24, 2019 at 10:07 AM",1, 2,

It is short.  $9.99 might seem like a good price if you know it is short, but it isn't $9.99 worth of short.  

It plays exactly like most other first person shooter games you have ever played.  Not much about the game play will stand out as new.  Teleport here and there.  Grab handles to climb ladders.  Swing a light saber mindlessly to attack.  Watch your enemy and block when he swings.  All standard (boring) fare for VR.

The only mechanic I though was good and new (to me at least) is being able to deflect blaster fire and bounce it back at the shooter.  That was pretty cool and, other than being in a star wars story, the highlight of the game for me.

Doing tasks and opening doors is mindlessly tedious.  Insert tool.  Turn knob.  Flip lever.  All the boring stuff VR has given over the past few years.   

I was hoping for more.  Maybe more will be delivered in future parts.   I was hoping for a combat system where you use the force to maybe see a little into the future to detect where the next attack is coming or something that can put you into slow motion like Super Hot.  

I would rather simply tag along for the ride and be immersed in a star wars story than have to waste time pushing buttons, flipping levers, and waving my saber around like a crazy person.","Jun 27, 2019 at 9:42 PM",2, 1,

The story was cool even though it was short like the devs said it would be, but honestly it didn't really feel that short, might be because I was messing around trying to explore what I could and doing a little roleplay with the characters lol.

Anyways, this game needs punches and powers or something with the second hand. I feel the single controller is good since imbidextrous, but!, my other hand is super bored and swings to punch to avail. Also when i have sword turned down as in a thumbs down motion to block, I always get striked and goes right through the sword. Not to happy about that. I was a black belt in my younger years and feel this game is a great work out. I feel the progression could pick up the pace a bit more after level fifteen. Where's the Darth Maul's bowstaff? I'm not scoring perfect everytime. but still a bit slow at higher levels. Love the game, super awesome, the dojo is way better than the story, graphics could be better too, but when characters stand bigger than me 6'4"" @ 215lbs, I feel something new that is rare. Lacks visual content, such as better texturs and eye candy compaired to other Oculus Sponsered titles, same goes with Lucus name on there. Oculus is an eye candy platform, fail in either super fun play or killer experience, risky flop. But the Dojo! - bring play re-play-ability!! For that, I give it 3 thumbs up!! Got on one, but the story with poor experience, thats why its free or $10 buck. StormLand seems to hit both for the first time. Common Lucus Arts!!

PS, The only reason the story seemed to short was because there was nothing to turn your head to look at, other than exploring your ship that got high jacked. Oculus isn't a tunnel vision or linear experience. It's a 360 experience. now that there is Diagonal Setup for Rift and those who have 3x setups, Rift S, as well as Quest. this should better. But, Dojo Rocks!! If you can't do better in the story and textures, focus on that!! Multi Dojo!! More wepons, build my own custom sword!! Those who can will.","Jun 26, 2019 at 12:43 AM",5, 1,

Your expectations need to be set right on this so you're not disappointed by the length. They're called ""episodes"", after all!

Lightsaber combat is AWESOME - everything I dreamed wielding a lightsaber would be since I was a kid! 

Story is very interesting, a central part of the experience. I won't give any details away, but it's clear to see how this canonical story will add to the overall lore of Star Wars. It leaves us with a cliffhanger we'll want to learn more about.

Voice acting ranges from decent to good, and is never disappoints or detracts from the story. Most importantly, Scott Lawrence does a good job with Vader's voice (that's critical for obvious reasons).

Environments are fascinating, and they make you want to look around. This keeps it from feeling like the experiencde is ""on rails"" too much, but the story still moves quickly / you don't get lost in the environments.

The Main Game was breath taking. Everything looked and felt amazing, the visuals of the star destroyer was breath taking. Meeting Lord Vader was as a long time star wars fan an indescribable feeling, he was tall dark and imposing. Everything just felt right!

The story itself is quite interesting and promises to get even better as the episodes go on, do yourself a favour and don't miss out on this experience, the light sabre battles felt so genuine. It may have been short but i've not enjoyed a game this much in over a year!

2022-05-28 11:21:35.513323,Deytow,Combat is a bore,"Combat is dissapointing. One blaster deflection fight and one saber fight which makes it the weakest part of the game. In the arena mode you are fighting bland  endless waves of droids with a lightsaber, which is only fun for so long. One big annoyance to the combat system is that if I swing my saber into a strike the saber will just go through the vibrosword and hit me. This really takes me out of it since I have to just keep blocking until it lets me hit it, no freedom of attacking.

Your droid companion isn't terrible but just talks too much and I just couldn't get that voice out of my head. I understand that they need someone to answer the questions for you since your player doesn't say anything but it gets to a point where the pestering is just annoying. 

Darth Vader is the best part of the game and is the saving grace. I never felt how much I would be outmatched by him until now. This is the only reason why I would say that the story mode is worth playing.","Jun 21, 2019 at 1:15 PM",3, 3,

The game was still buggy when I played it, I had to enter an elevator through its roof with the ladder, but at some point I got an out of bound error that made my screen black so i released my grip and got back on top of the elevator, the roof closed and I was stuck there for the whole descent (I had to quit and resume to fix it but still)
I played on the Rift S, and a lot of scenes were in the dark, and it's not really comfortable with lcd screen, because the black smear occulted the details in thoses scenes

Now here's what i suggest to improve in future episodes :
- Remove out of bound error, it's experience killing
- Light up some scenes for the rift S or let us set brightness

I wanted to explore, not be led. Sneak up on my enemies, not just hack and slash. Maybe some easter eggs to find, not just movie quotes.

One thing that kept bugging me throughout this episode is how much the game loves to glue your feet to the ground. You cannot move in combat, and almost everything you interact with requires you to be locked in place directly infront of it. It always frustrates me when games take freedom away from the player, even more so in VR.

Otherwise it was very good. Hand animations are very smooth and precise, there is minimal 'snapping' when you grab onto things. I was particularly impressed with the hands gripping the crossbow (just a shame you can't use it!)

The story telling is incredible, graphics on the RIft and Rift S are great. Almost everything about the game is good.

When all three episodes are released, I hope the developers can make it so that players can access all episodes whithout buying all the episodes, like a bundle.

It's an hour long, at max., full of bugs related to movement and camera placement.

It's not bad, it has good ambientation; good voice over; good lightsabers; sound and climbing. But in the final fight I had to fight against the ""return to the game"" screen more than I had to fight enemies and seeing that after the game telling me that my space is small is just dumb. If its small then how am I always ""outside"" of the game?

I do like a good story though and I felt that part was done extremely well. I did feel very led through it and it would have been nice to have a few genuine puzzles that took some working out. This could have increased game time if you had to enter different areas then go back on yourself after finding key items etc, but no it is completely linear. If you want to be part of a movie like sequence with no particularly hard challenge then this is for you. The fact you are in a star wars world is amazing and the light saber is excellent. I have to give this 4 stars for quality, but for me it was more of a kids game based on the challenges, but that's just me. Hoping the next one is a bit harder. Can you actually die I ask myself?

-Setting to change the camera rotation from snap to smooth motion with the joystick doesn’t appear to work

Oh yes, it s very short, but for what the experience offer you and the price, we will not spit on it ! however, develloper getting the prodigious idea to do training features room, with some multiple situation to get, different crystal light saber color to unlock, different light saber skin.

Getting to stage 5 on 20 from my memory, more than 20 stage wait you, very challenging, need technique, and look random position ball, random attack for each time you start, very nice praticing to counter attack with droid who simulate light saber duuel.
And to finish, extra to unlock, as purple light saber, orange, green etc... different handle, 3 different area ambiance

So, you need call the force, may be with you.
Because the end of this episode, is exactly what player was don t dream about, and this is exactly what player need from our day with all that recycled game, exept some one...

In quality, 10/10. However, it's probably best to wait for the entire thing to be out before dishing out any $ for it. I beat it in about 30-40 minutes. There's not enough combat going on, only 2 sequences; just deflecting some blasters and then fighting the same enemy over and over for a few minutes with the same attack pattern. If they're going to charge $10 or so for games here, average duration should be in description.

As you progress deeper into the story, you can't help but feel like you're another major character in the epic story of light vs. dark, with a climactic ending that leaves you wanting more.

About the more part - the experience lasts about 45 minutes. It's short, but for $10.00 it beats sitting in a theater when instead you're part of the action. From facing off with Stormtroopers, to working your way secretly around, you'll have a blast skiffing and climbing around. The graphics are top-notch and the game ran smoothly on my GTX 1070, i7-6700, 16GB system.

The light saber training dojo is pretty cool, but the battles feel real. It's just not real swordplay - more like Star Wars swordplay, but trust me, you won't care one bit.

Unfortunately the game is only about an hour long and I don't understand why the developer couldn't have made it any longer. All the game resources that are implemented make sense so it's just up to the developer to actually make a longer story. There might be a part two but I wish this was a full game not just an experience!
Also the game made my oculus crash several times after 2 minutes or gameplay, so none of the sensors on the oculus or controllers would get detected until the pc is restarted.","Jun 23, 2019 at 12:34 AM",3, 1,

However, it's a great Star Wars experience, the machnics of crawling, unlocking doors and especially.. lightsaber fighting and deflecting of laser bullets is just very very satisfying. I really wish you would be able to do more though, as.. go up to Stormtroopers and cut them in half, arms off, legs off etc. stuff like that, just for the fun of it. or even grab them, hit them with your hands etc.

I hope that the next episode, which will focus on force powers will be more in depth with everything.

Also, the game NEEDS 2 things especially!..

1. Allow people to choose their lightsaber color
2. Brightness adjustment, the game is SOOOO dark at times, and e.g. when recording, it becomes even darker.

Other than that, I definitely recommend this.","Jun 22, 2019 at 9:13 PM",4, 1,

In the part where you're climbing outside of the facility, and you need to take your partner's hand to help you up, they wouldn't let go of my hand after pulling me up.

Well, I was half wrong and half right. 

The storytelling is actually my favorite part. They did a fantastic job sucking you into the character and everything around you. It was a very satisfying experience.

The gameplay was definitely basic. Even down to the lightsaber dueling. But that doesnt mean it wasnt fun. Interacting with things and walking around was a joy minus using ladders, that could have been done differently. 

And of course what everybody wants to hear about, the lightsaber action. When I first got the saber and picked it up, turning it on, my heart raced for one of the numerous times througout the experience. Its what you would expect, blocking and swinging. It feels a little mechanical mostly. But enjoyable nonetheless.

If you do not own it, it is more than worth the $10 asking price, getting to feel like your actually in Start Wars.

Biggest complaint would be in dogo mode, physics seem to be off.  I'm on level 29 and there seems to be times when I block and their saber seems to go right through my saber and kill me with no reasoning as to how this is occuring I can only assume its a bug or physics problem.  I get it supposed to be hard, but their saber going through my saber and killing me when I'm clearly blocking their hit isn't logical.

2022-05-28 11:22:20.424729,Saijar,The Most Immersive Star Wars Experience,"Let’s face it, ten dollars in VR is like spending .99 cents in the app store.
This is a short (54 minutes for me) VR experience but it is WELL worth your money. You will not feel closer to the Star Wars Universe unless you go to a theme park or movie studio (this feels like you are visiting Mustafar)
Facing Vader and traversing Mustafar could not be a more enthralling experience. With climbing and saber battles, you’d be hard pressed to find someone who did not have a little bit of fear when looking Darth Vader in the face after all these years.
The second part MUST have more puzzle solving and intensive lightsaber battles though.
Although quite linear, the experience is one you do not want to miss, and has been one of my favorite VR moments in the life of my Rift. Although some might disagree, there IS joy in repetition when replaying titles like this, and it seems that there are many levels in Vader’s Dojo to keep you entertained until the next part releases.
This is well worth your $10, because be honest, you have spent more than $10 dollars on less rewarding experiences since you purchased your VR headset.
Games like Vader Immortal will start changing the VR landscape for the better, and supporting such a rounded Quest (although I played on Rift) title is only going to make VR become more mainstream.

For the first time ever it actually felt as if I was right in the moment as a lightsaber wielding person.
Even the combat at the end required me to put some real effort into my stance and saber wielding moves instead of just willy-nilly holding the controler left and right to auto-block.
The now somewhat ""old"" CV1 Rift and its low resolution was also not very noticeable in most instances, because there is just so much to look at you don't really pay attention to it, unless you'd be in it just to nitpick. :D

However, the excelent designs of the game this is where my two main things come form:
1) Game is really dark. Perhabs it's immersive on Quest, but i was always hoping to get a glimpse of a bit more detail. Please make it at least a bit brighter in the next episodes so i can actually examine all the amazing stuff :)

2) It was throwing ""please return to the play area"" (or something like this) warning on me all the time. Often when i tried to just look at something. Sometimes it was because i was too close to stuff in game (prevening head in the wall), but often with no reason at all, or when i was closer than an arm's length to an object. One time when i turned the head staying in one place! Once when a character moved in front of me (i didn't move) when some invisible collider moved probably with them.

No problem with the Rift S.

Graphics set to high with full motion control and 360 combat (with enough room space it's possible).
No stutter and fps drops.
Just a bit of vertigo here and there, but it's all part of the design.

There is only one thing that I found annoying: the occlusion system. Every time I was too close to a wall, the screen went black with a message telling me that I was out of the world... Sometimes that system made the combat impossible!

2022-05-28 11:22:26.854187,Yaska,A (very) Short but Sweet experience,"Vader Immortal is a full fledged Star Wars experience which shows what a first person Star Wars game could be capable of on Virtual Reality, you have few puzzles, lightsabering, deflecting blaster shots and even a interesting plot exploring the history of planet Mustafar.

However, this experience is SHORT. It took me less than 40 minutes to actually go through and when I got to the end it felt like ""Is this it? Did it end already?"" and not in a good way but in a bad way.

The game suffers from few bugs here and there where your screen will be blank but fixing this usually needs you to just move your head.

The graphic options are just high and low, nothing to tinker in between, but the experience uses Unreal Engine, so ini modifying should prove higher image quality in the future.

The audio was positional and it felt delightful to turn my head and listen to the characters. 

I would recommend this experience only to the most hardcore Star Wars fans for the asking price. It essentially feels like a paid demo and at 9.99 it's not simply worth the asking price for what you get in the story. You also get some Oculus Home items and a Lightsaber dojo to practice your lightsaber skills, but I would personally recommend getting Fruit Ninja or Beat Saber, both games that will offer you either more content or a better price.","Jun 21, 2019 at 5:41 PM",3, 1,

The game takes 45 minutes to finish
It's pretty much on rails
Blasters fire at you VERY slowly

Now for the Pros:
Excellent voice acting
Very immersive
Just enough exposition that you understand but not enough that you feel they are cramming story in
Beautiful visuals, especially during the one major ""storytelling"" portion
Some of the best lightsaber mechanics I've played

This is a fantastic ""game"". As I've said, it's very short, and the main story has little replay value. But the ""minigame"" portion that keeps upping the difficulty is really nice. The blaster shots in the minigame come at you a little faster, and it makes it feel closer to the ""real"" thing. 

If you aren't big into Star Wars, this isn't gonna do it for you. This game banks on the fact that the people playing are looking for any piece of canon that could be mined for more details. I won't talk about spoilers here, but there is plenty teased in this game. 

The $10 pricetag hurts a bit, but I'm sure I'll get my moneys worth in the minigame. I am excited for the next two portions, and I hope they offer a bit more content. This is a really great hamburger, when I really want steak.","Jun 21, 2019 at 7:37 AM",4, 1,

Let's start with the bad. ( Ok its short 45 minutes or so ).  You don't have the freedom of movement one would love to have with in a title such as this. You are set on a pre-determined path you have to follow.  There wasn't enough action in my eyes personally during the experience. Few buttons, switches etc. But lacking in what i'd say would make it a 5 start totally mind blowing experience. 
Character interaction would have been a bit better with more ways to confront the storm troopers, vader, etc. 
That Said.
The Good. It's a truly awesome virtual reality experience (not mind blowing but awesome.. The details of the warp, the space ship, etc you literally felt like you were in an actual Star Wars Movie. Graphics were incredible ( even tho in many areas they were quite dark and lacked enough detail ). The darkness however did give it this ominous feeling throughout the game experience.  
Lord Vader was as real as he could get towering in his awesome cloak and helmet. 
I give this a 4 star rating mostly because the cinematic styling of the game places you as near ( IN a movie) as one could possibly get. There is room for improvement from the Devs regarding Character interactions, being allowed to make different choices to figure things out, taking different routes etc. However all in all I loved and enjoyed the experience this game provided.  
I ran this on high settings on the Rift S with the Graphics tweaked in oculus diagnostic tools to 2.0. and increased ingame graphics to 1.5 as well. 
Running I7-8700 3.20GHz, 16G ram, GTX 1080.
Was it worth the price of admission? for me Absolutely. It takes a ton of work hours, man power, designers, etc to create anything in virtual reality and often times some titles just fail. This however does not fail.

2022-05-28 11:22:36.501695,Quisan,Feels like a prototype,"Be warned that this is a lightly interactive experience, not an actual game. There are no choices to be made, just a few simple actions you have to perform. 

My biggest problem has to do with the controls. There's no free movement, just blink teleportation, which I find disorienting and incredibly annoying since it takes you out of the flow of the scene. 

It would be great to have control over which hand uses the light saber, too. I found it awkward to wield with the right hand. 

The voice acting is very good; it just seems like this is a prototype and needs a whole lot more work to make it interesting. This should have been released as a free teaser for a more complete experience.","Jun 22, 2019 at 1:35 PM",3, 1,

I beat it in less than an hour, and I feel like I took my time.  The visuals, the story, the combat, all amazing and more polished than most games out on Oculus now.  Some backdrops might not be the best quality, but other than that, everything was beautiful.

I feel like they really nailed the basic mechanics, so hopefully in later episodes, they go all out with the content.  I just imagine a VR title with these mechanics, but full length like KOTOR or even Jedi Outcast, and it makes me so excited to see what's in store for VR's future.  The combat is a lot of fun, I haven't been immersed enough to punch my ceiling fan in a long time.

I ran this on the regular Oculus Rift on a rig with a 1080ti, AMD FX 8350, and 16GB RAM and it ran perfectly.","Jun 21, 2019 at 11:41 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 11:22:46.060430,Drdoomblunt,Interactive Fiction,"Vader Immortal succeeds in looking and feeling authentically star wars. The visuals are great, although the lighting feels a bit lack luster, but the sound design is amazing. Voice acting is also good across the five characters we meet here. 

The world lacks authentic interactivity. You can't pick up the sabaac cards on your ship and toss them around, only preset items are interactable. What you can interactive with though feels incredibly seemless. The climbing especially was done well, with a semi-guided system that I feel makes it better than the climbing systems in other games like Lone Echo.

As for the combat, the lightsabre looks a bit stilted, 90fps still isn't enough to provide convincing motion to it, and the hit detection requires you to use slower swings which means at least flailing won't autowin, except you can't die here. There's a chapter system, but I could find no way to die. Ledges have invisible walls, falls do damage to you, the robots that strike you deal damage, but it's more of an annoyance and an eye ache than an actual mechanic. I would highly recommend turning damage indicators off, since you can't actually die in the main story.

As for price/content ratio, for £8 I got about an hour from the episode itself, and the dojo probably provides another hour or two. The dojo is probably the more gamelike section of this, with actual fail states, scoring and rewards that can be used in the main game.

Overall, it's a fun little episodic story with an interesting mini-game, though I think £8 is currently a stretch. I would recommend waiting for a bundle with all episodes is available.","Jun 22, 2019 at 12:36 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 11:22:46.086361,The1Ross,Taste the potential of VR...,"This experience is quite spectacular while it lasts, especially for a Star Wars fan. It really gives you a taste of VR's future potential, but unfortunately takes it away from you while you're just getting into it.

The Story mode is about 45 minutes long, and takes you through a variety of authentic locations that genuinly feel as though they were ripped straight from the Star Wars Universe. Seeing Vader up close and fighting alongside him is definitely a highlight and I'm sure something many fans have dreamt of experiencing since they were children. Unfortunately, even if you take into consideration the low price tag and that fact that VR is still a comparitively small market, it simply felt far too short. 

The dojo mode will bring me back for another 3-5 hours I'd guess and I'll certainly be showing this to any friend that visits in the foreseeable future, but still...I can't quite shake the sour taste left in my mouth of what could have been if they'd stretched it out a bit longer.

Having said all that, I still definitely recommend it for the pricetag and it leaves me excited for the future of VR. Bring on Episode 2!","Jun 21, 2019 at 10:31 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 11:22:46.112291,Tyrthemis,lots of ups and downs,"overall well worth $10, the story is very compelling, investigating (MINOR SPOILERS) Vader's fall to the dark side in more detail is enlightening (END SPOILERS), lightsaber fighting is fun, but it feels so easy, that being said this is episode 1 with training bots, I hope enemies get faster and stop telegraphing their next move for a painfully obvious 2-3 seconds, the graphics are pretty well done, except for some far away areas on mustafar are blurry.  A sense of presense is also well done, until the game tells you for the 20th time that you've ventured outside the play space and your screen goes black, and then it doesnt let you move around during a ton of the gameplay.  I feel like the door puzzles are oddly complex, like they are easy but it feels ""forced"" (pun intended) that a door would have a certain puzzle, climbing is meh.  I don't like how slow the locomotion is, and you only have snap turning or something very similar to it if youre using slide locomotion, not the end of the world.  Blaster bolts should be faster, maybe like lightblade VR fast, this speed just seems like they are babying you.

2022-05-28 11:25:07.516276,cnjackson,Amazing,"The physics, ui and story telling worked right. Using a lightsaber just felt right. Micropayments for chapters of a story is a great way to avoid paying AAA prices for a flop. Its really 2 games, the story line and beat saber like training that would be fun all by itself. It would be cool to play vs other people online someday. Oh and it works on Revive but you might need to set the graphics to low in game.","Aug 6, 2019 at 4:49 AM",5, 0,
