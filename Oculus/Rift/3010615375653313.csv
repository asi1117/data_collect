2022-05-28 20:32:52.267379,Resylt,This game is so worth the price...but,"The pros: Beautiful, and the ease of controls (while take getting used to) give such precise control in an environment where physics takes quite a toll. 

But, minus one star for one thing. 

I am so tired of VR games forcing me into an action funnel. Sometimes I want to sit down, put on the headset, and casually play. Especially with a space game. I want to be able to take my time, go around, gather as much resources as I want to, build as much as I want to, and just scale up from there until I max out. 

So what gets me about this game, is that after 4 or 5 missions, when you get near Saturn and Jupiter, you guys force us into an action funnel, by only allowing us 8 to 10 minutes per journey out of the station to go get resources. 

I was -really...REALLY- hopeful when I saw this game that it was a sandbox-style game where I could just collect and build. 

But no...you've gotta put a time limit on it, and force me down a path where eventually I will run out of time, therefore putting a cap on the maximum station that I can build, and add-ons that I can put to my probe.","Dec 19, 2020 at 9:56 AM",4, 43,
2022-05-28 20:32:52.282339,Kraknor,Unrealistic travel times,"The main issue for me is the completely unrealistic travel times. It does not take 7 years to travel from Earth to Venus, Venus to Mercury etc. Typical orbital transfers take ~ 6-9 months in the inner solar system (see Hohmann transfers). I urge the developers to divide travel times by a factor of 10 to make them more realistic, as this totally broke the immersion for me.

Besides this, AGOS has an innovative VR control system for piloting probes. The tutorial is currently a little lacking in detail, but it is great fun once you figure out how to manoeuvre.","Jan 5, 2021 at 3:47 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 20:32:52.297299,wbc8233,Great game!,"If you like space type games - buy it . 
It is easy to get the hang of but gets a bit hader as you go . 
I feel like I got my monies worth with this one. I was going to give it 4 stars because I had to download ubisoft and steam to make it work . Not sure why someone would make a game you have to download extra crap to your computer but it was worth it. I am fairly new to vr and this is the 4th or 5th game I have bought . I really enjoied playing it .","Dec 26, 2020 at 5:51 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:32:52.311261,MikeOfSpades,It's fun if not a bit limited.,"This is a fun space game that I might change my review for in the future.  What I have played has been a basic, casually fun, and relaxing space experience.  It's been a bit of navigating probe here and there while avoiding the environment.  My main issue with this game is that as a VR game, there is no comfort setting.  I prefer to play without any blinders of any sort and currently can not turn off the comfort mode while chaning my view of the probe.  This is a minor but irritating issue.  If not for that, would definitely earn at least 4 stars.","Oct 30, 2020 at 2:24 AM",3, 21,
2022-05-28 20:32:52.326221,Masamune5454,i like it alot,"updated review.
this is something ive not seen in vr yet. i dont mean the controls, so much as the combination of everything. let me be clear, this is a long game. theres alot you have to do just to get to where you can change space ship parts and probe parts. but when you do get there, its super fun. you can build your spaceship part by part, and every piece is a usable upgrade, for example a time loop thing, that once installed on your ship, will allow you to speed up time when playing. super cool.
i highly reccomend this if your the type that likes to get very involved in games and can spend time in it. The first huge asteroid i put my clamp onto and pulled it away i was shocked. some really cool ideas here, and i hope more stick with it past the tutorial. still needs some more options added like vigenette on\off ect.
all in all its really cool, whether your clamping your robo arm onto a turret to rip it away and use it yourself, or shoving a battery into a socket, or just trying to mine resources as much as you can, its all very engaging and leaves me wanting to dive back in agian. Ubisoft connect is a peice of crap though, i wish they wouldnt make it mandatory. that turns off some people right there.

its a slow burn, but the game is fun. more than anything scavenging and using tools is the best, and i do wish they implemented more options in which to use your hands, but its a cool idea. im not into VR flight sims ussually, so im surprised i like it. maybe the slower gameplay is a nice change of pace. but turn those blinders off, uggh. and maybe more options in general.","Nov 2, 2020 at 5:45 PM",5, 20,
2022-05-28 20:32:55.449474,esc4p3,Great VR Experience,"In general this is a repetitive SciFi Simulation where you are controlling probes in order to gather ressources with which you can enhance the probes and a big ship called world ship. What I like specifically are the vr controls of the probes. After some time it became fun to navigate using the zero g environment. 

But at some points when you need to move up or down in space you still know where is up and down since the vr camera is not moving fully with the probe which also leads to view issues when navigating through asteroids or in stations where the space is pretty small.

I hope there will be some future updates with new objects and extended management for the worldship for instance.

In total it is a really good vr experience. If you like this type of game you will spend hours in there without noticing as I did :)","Nov 17, 2020 at 5:34 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 20:32:55.464434,smokeykiller51,Having fun so far.,I would listen to the book I am Bob from audiable then play this. Loads fine. Just have to launch ubisoft so it can link your account first. So if your having issues id recomend you install the ubisoft launcher and run it before even launching this first. Other than that fun so far controls are easy to master rather relaxing..,"Oct 29, 2020 at 9:43 AM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 20:32:55.480391,Draek2017,"Great Title! Graphics, Style & Gameplay","I really enjoy this game. I really enjoy the gameplay arcade style controlling things in 3D and trying to improve your ship as you travel space. It's just great graphics, fun gameplay for people who like details and customization.

I really hope we see many more titles that are high quality graphics and great VR gameplay and controls like this.","Nov 15, 2020 at 1:17 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:32:55.495351,Soulblazer42,UPlay launcher wont authenticate thegame,"UPDATE TO RESPOND TO DEV - You keep saying this but this is BS! Because I also sent in a ticket and was logged into my ONLY UBISOFT ACCOUNT and ONLY OCULUS ACCOUNT.  While support sent me the same message, when i logged in, in the morning the issue was fixed and it was linked. 

This is your issue ubisoft. Take some accountability and fix your product. Now onto the review.

I havn't been able to play the game yet. After linking my oculus account to Uplay and run the game it tells me ""It's unable to authenticate the game ""That it is not pirated"" and to contact customer support.

When will ubisoft ever learn in regards to their launcher. This is rediculous.","Nov 10, 2020 at 6:39 AM",1, 4,"Hi there, Soulblazer42! Thank you for posting this review about AGOS: A Game of Space!

But, after playing for 30 minutes, I was completely engaged flying through asteroids and taking in the scenery of the solar system.

2022-05-28 20:32:58.682433,Doctori,FIrst impression is good!,"Just played my first hour. Really liked learning how to fly the probe. Looks fantastic orbiting planet and massive asteroid coming at you and space station. Also music is enticing and relaxing all headphoned up. Still early but the experience is going to be really nice I can see, did first resource gather where you needed 50 is all.

Also, just make sure your logged into uplay with your main account, whatever account you want the game linked to. I got one pop up on monitor said do you want to link, yes, all good. Pretty simple. I still am shocked to my core that ubisoft still requires this, they lose so many customers and/or returns because it causes so many issues nowadays where peeps have multiple accounts and don't know or understand...

Anyway experience looks great, sounds great. Running on a quest 2, link cable, with a 2080 super card.","Dec 25, 2020 at 12:51 PM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 20:33:01.799235,Shryyke,Very relaxing / repetitive game,"It is interesting and very relaxing. So far you send out probes and gather resources. You can create new probes with different tools to gather different types of resources. It is very repetitive but the flight mechanics are unique and actually fun to play with. I have not left our solar system yet and feel like I'm still in a tutorial mode, but I have a feeling it will get to be more of the same unless you come upon new technology that I have not seen and get to add new probes and gear. 

I will say the visuals are very good, if not a tad arcade like. I mean, in some areas it feels like they are doing a sonic the hedgehog thing in which you fly through asteroids with holes in them collecting glowing green shard. Yep, in space! The game is a great way to just relax and chill in my opinion and for that I like it, but honestly, I'm not rushing to finish this game simply because right now, it just means I get a new fishing lure in my toolbox every now and then. Other than that, its just flying the probes and watching the asteroids. :)

I will update this review if it gets more exciting, again, I'm still in our solar system within the game. Promise not to give any spoilers, if there are any, away!","Oct 29, 2020 at 10:22 PM",4, 5,
