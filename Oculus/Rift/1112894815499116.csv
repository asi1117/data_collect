Not able to play the game even after purchasing it.","Jun 12, 2020 at 10:15 PM",1, 7,

2022-05-28 18:13:09.198791,UglyFish819,"Fair game, fun but some flaws","Decent shooter with nice graphics but there are some flaws. The angle of the guns in your hand is wierd and takes a little getting use to. The upgrade system is not the best and there is a huge lack of weapon selection (only 3 weapons with only 2 powerups) There is no option to skip to a specific wave which means when you die you have to start all over from wave 1 (this really takes the motivation to play again away). 

The worst however is the lack of music when playing the levels. There is music in the menu section but no music when playing. Some fast paced rock or techno music would really set the zombie busting mood, but total silence except for a couple sound effects just kills the excitement and really takes away from the game.

Over all this is a fair game, but it could be an awesome game with a bit of effort / improvement from the developers.","Sep 28, 2018 at 4:49 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:13:09.216741,leo100001,Game does not work!!!,Cannot figure out how to get it going. Only one of the menues worked and it seems only one level works.  Whatever worked is not good.,"Jul 3, 2017 at 9:45 AM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 18:13:09.235690,vanfanel,Good wave shooter,After spending more time with it this game is a really decent wave shooter.  It will definitely give you fingers/forearm a workout.  For a simple wave shooter it's fairly polished and graphically impressive.  There are leaderboards and multiple play modes.  For the price it's definitely worth the value.  I'm surprised I never heard of it before until it just popped up in the store.,"Apr 5, 2017 at 1:10 PM",4, 6,"Thanks for your kind review and playing Zombie Buster. 
I've seen your surprising score on the world rank. You are the best zombie buster."
2022-05-28 18:13:12.387261,dogsimple,This is the best VR shooter game,"The graphic quality and content are unbelievably greate considering the price.

It's hard to play VR games for more than 15 minutes because of dizziness, but I didnt feel dizzy at all even after playing the game for more than an hour!

If you had bought this game and your world ranking is not getting higher, try to play at the practice mode for enough time. You will be able to experience all stages and gain great amount of scores.

This is the best VR shooter game that I have ever played!","Apr 6, 2017 at 4:08 PM",5, 6,Thanks for your review.
2022-05-28 18:13:12.403218,Wonzel,Somehow like Serious Sam.,I really like it. It gives a lot of fun and the weapons are nice to handle with the touch controler. I just wish more enemys because just 3 different ones are not enouth. But this game could become a real star in the Orculus-Store. I really love to see my arms in the game. Thats even better then in Serious Sam! Wow! :-),"Apr 11, 2017 at 6:58 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 18:13:12.418179,XxMaster_ZxX,Good game,"This is not by any means a bad game, however there are a few improvements to be made. A better upgrade system would be nice and an option to scale the rediculously big guns you're using, they break immersion so badly and blaringly remind you that this is a video game. I kind of understand why they're so big with the limited resolution making it harder to see down the sights to aim on smaller guns but they just hold you back from really getting into the game. The graphics and gameplay are great though, if you enjoy wave shooters or get nauseous from a lot of movement and need to stand in place, this is the game for you!                  EDIT: The gun size is no longer an issue, upped it to 4 stars! =)","Apr 24, 2017 at 11:16 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 18:13:12.434135,ZombiesnacK,Nice Wave Shooter,"There are many Wave Shooter out there and this one is not bad, but i think it needs some improvements here and there. Like weapon stability and a better Extras/upgrade System. The Sound and Grafix are really Good, so is the atmosphere. Its worth the ten Bucks but i wouldnt pay more for this.","Apr 10, 2017 at 6:38 AM",3, 2,
