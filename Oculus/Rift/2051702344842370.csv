2022-05-28 15:11:00.655134,Jwu_Assassin,I hope more levels come out!!,love this game with family.  Always brings a ton of laughs.  Just wished there was more levels and different squirrels too!,Apr 11 at 10:07 AM,4, 0,
2022-05-28 15:11:00.673086,Brayekor,Hectic and Full of Laughs,"I have played this game several times with online friends. My friends could connect very easily to my lobby, even from being in different countries (some in Canada, one in Australia, i live in the US). There was a little lag with my friend in Australia, but it was still playable for him. The only thing i would say is that some of my friend's phones had issues running the game, so that kind of hindered them during play. I would recommend developing a website or a computer application for those who join the VR user so they can have a seemingly easier time playing.

Pros:
    -Lots of Laughs
    -Very Fun for parties
    -Easy to Connect to the VR user
         -Even in seperate countries

Cons:
    -Some phones may struggle with the game
    -Would be easier to play as a squirrel with a computer","Aug 3, 2020 at 2:12 AM",5, 16,"Thank you for letting us know what you think! If you or your friends want to share any more details about the issues you experienced on the phones, please send us an email at support@resolutiongames.com."

2022-05-28 15:11:00.703007,Flipper8207,Must have for multiplayer action!,"This game is brilliant in that more than one person can play and from anywhere.
I give the developers kudos and hope other developers follow.
Now for the requests or gentle suggestions.
1. Reverse view for the squirrels when running away would be great whether you can press a button or it's automatic.
2. Squirrels should be able to jump and sprint.  It's frustrating getting stuck behind small mounds and not able to jump up (as well as have the mound blocking the view of anything since the view doesn't reverse.)  Sprinting short distances would be nice for all squirrels.
3. Tree's accuracy should be slightly more realistic.  It seems too easy to nail a squirrel on the otherside of the map.
Overall the game is great but seems to not be weighted evenly.  
Typically it's Tree plus 2 sometimes 3 squirrels in our house and it seems way too easy for tree to dominate.
My most important request is to be able to look forward running away from the tree.  I know where the tree is and would rather see where I'm running.
I also like that anyone with the app can join from anywhere.  My friend was playing with us from San francisco and I live in San Jose, very fun.
Please continue to support this game and PLEASE make others like it with the multiplayer function.  I will buy it!
Update 11/5/19!  Aim assist in the menu!  I'll have to read what else I missed!  Be nice to have a view rotation button in the menu too!
Thank you","Nov 5, 2019 at 11:16 PM",5, 16,"Hello Flipper8207 and thank you so much for your kind words! We really appreciate your suggestions. The way the camera works for the squirrels is a design choice from our side, but we love to hear what you think and we'll definitely consider this as well as your other points. You can turn off aim assist in the menu (press the left menu button and tick or untick the 'Aim Assist' option)."

Kids (6 and 8) absolutely loved it.

Edit:
Today (31 aug) the game is almost unplayable due to frequent disconnects from the game server. Perhaps the developer needs to up their infra. Did you get too popular?

Edit:
(Oct 17) Seen no more problems connecting. We always have a blast when playing this!","Oct 18, 2019 at 3:10 AM",5, 32,
2022-05-28 15:11:03.828647,Try4Ce,"Great family fun, but more modes needed","When I saw this game popping up, it was an instant buy from me. I love the idea with the async mobile/vr connection and it fits perfectly. I played this game with my 4yr old son and my wife and we had a blast. My son laughed his b*** off fighting off mom and dad.

We just came to realization - This game might need more game modes where the VR player needs to fight off the squirrels. Right now there is just sometime like ""capture the flag"" where the squirrels need to get all the golden acorns back to base, so to say.

Maybe it would be nice to get something like an ""obstacle course"" where the squirrels need to get through to reach the tree. The first squirrel to reach the tree wins. If a squirrel gets beaten down, it either starts at the beginning or at a checkpoint. The obstacle courses would need places to hide from the tree, and the tree might get some new skills to play with like triggering traps, filling small ponds or something.

Something like that would add GREATLY to the overall experience. The concept itself is fantastic and, to me and my family, the best solution for async multiplayer since nobody needs to look at the tv screen with connected usb controllers, split screen stuff and so on.

Great fun for the family nontheless! Really worth the price!","Sep 2, 2019 at 5:44 PM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 15:11:03.843606,liamf777,Great fun,"This game is very fun to play and i have found my self dieing of laughter while taking out my kids squirrels with bombs to the back of there heads while they try and scurry away with my acorns. The only problem is apart from a few different levels to battle in there isnt realy much else to it. I am craving for more levels , game modes and powerups. As the game currently stands id say its a brilliantly fun demo sized experience and i really hope there is much more to be added soon","Sep 16, 2019 at 8:04 PM",5, 3,Thank you so much for the feedback and we're so glad you're having a good time playing with your family. We'll keep these things in mind as we keep working on the game!
2022-05-28 15:11:03.858566,theregoes2,A Lot Of Fun With The Kids,If you have kids who play VR then this game is a must buy. Just played for about 2 hours with the kids and I had to make them take a break because they didn't want to stop.,"Aug 31, 2019 at 2:28 AM",4, 14,
2022-05-28 15:11:03.873526,Descentile,Kill dem' Squirrels,"This game is so well done. Yeah, the squirrels can be overwhelming, but that means you have to be on point with your tree skills. I'm a Tree Beast, sniping from a far, dropin' dem bombs. This game has been the best $20 I have spent on Oculus. So much fun...","Sep 8, 2019 at 10:04 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:11:03.888487,rc51rider,Super fun multiplayer game!,Just set this up at a B-day party for 10 kids and they LOVED it!   We had 1 Rift S and 6 mobile devices and it was non-stop fun for 2 hours.!   The kids didn't even want to stop for cake which is unheard of.     It's also nice that it has cross-buy (free) with Rift and Quest.  Please make more games like this!,"Sep 2, 2019 at 11:08 PM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 15:11:07.042052,Talon1,It's a lot of fun!,"My family had a blast playing this game today.  It was really easy to get installed and going as well. The host starts a lobby and gets a little number.  They tell that number to the mobile users that are running the game app with an easy to understand UI. The game is really fun and competitive with some nice options for different strategy and team work.  I only really had 2 problems.  You have to take special note of the server region. One of mine was set to CAN instead of US and that caused problems, (probably my fault I admit).  And the other is my Ipad3 crashes after every match and the app takes about 20 - 30 seconds to re load.  So you miss a bit of the match.  Overall I'm really pleased and look forward to more stuff like this.  They are on to something!","Sep 3, 2019 at 8:36 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:11:07.057012,FANATIC777,Great concept but needs balancing,"This is a fantastic idea for how party games should be in VR.  Being able to have 8 people playing on their phones while someone uses the headset made game play enjoyable for everyone.  This game has 2 large issues however.
1) The game is very poorly balanced. The tree should loose every single game if you know what you are doing.  This makes the game boring after a few games.
2) Mobile support is very hit and miss. Among the 9 phones that I have tried the game on, 3 of them would crash on starting the game. 

Having said all that, this is a fun game and if those issues are fixed I would definitely recommend the game.","Sep 6, 2019 at 4:41 AM",3, 1,Really sorry to hear that you're experiencing issues with the mobile devices.
