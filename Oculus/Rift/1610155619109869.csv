2022-05-28 19:39:21.210953,beerhappy,Horrible.,"The experience is fleeting, and short. I thought it would be an experince like Synth. It was not.  I configured the graphics mode and it was still hot trash. No matter what high end card you have it looks like you are trapped in a 1990's landscape from a PS2.  I tried the other modes, and they were boring. Yeah wave around your hands and get sparkles...lame.  Other visual experience applications that requre ZERO money bury this app. Stay away from this, I know that the Oculus community in starved for visual relaxation, but app is really realy bad. I'll sum it up for you. Bunch of spawning vines and a weird eye. Done. Stay away from this!!!","Aug 2, 2020 at 2:35 PM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 19:39:21.226910,Mushroomies,Fantastic,Beautiful Worlds Explored mixed with wonderful Music to calm the soul. This is a Artistic Masterpiece. My only wish is there was more to explore. I could have remained in these worlds for days. Thank you for your Artistic Creation,"Aug 9, 2020 at 8:54 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:39:21.241870,Liam.Sullivan1984,,"This was basically a short video that could have been found on youtube. Charging money for it is outrageous frankly. The video quality wasn't even good; it was quite heavily pixilated. 

Having this on here is basically a con. Seeing if they can trick people into taking a punt on it. Really would suggest you avoid.","Oct 14, 2018 at 6:37 PM",1, 3,"we are sorry that you were not enjoying our experience. We hope you will give it a try again as there are much more features than just a video. Did you try to watch the videos in full 4K (HEVC extension must be installed described in instructions)? Maybe you have choosen one of the lower quailties which we also offer for users with not so high performing equipment. Did you check the several music mixes embedded which can be selected by Touch Controllers? The Touch Controllers are used for the SpaceShip menu, inside the videos for selection different mixes and in Fantasy Shapes and Rays of Light: Here you can emit particles like leaves, suns, laser beams, or different fantasy beams and fireworks listening binaural music for relaxation. Fantasy Shapes and Rays of Light last 6 min and 6:30 as additional content and can be looped for a longer stay."
2022-05-28 19:39:21.273293,Alicia_Wonderland,This should be a free demo,"This is the first experience I purchased at full price because it sounded exactly like the type of thing I like-- a beautiful relaxing meditative or psychedelic experience with no shooting or timers... But this was more of a demo that should have been free. I have MUCH better free experiences than this which are more beautiful, more creative, longer and more interactive. This is just a ripoff. You have no control to fly or do anything and the experience is ridiculously short. There are cool free music videos or rollercoasters longer than this. The bonus content is even shorter, maybe 1 minute.  I am hoping to get a refund but I played this several times, thinking I was missing something. There are control instructions for the touch, but they do nothing. There is no way to move, fly, teleport or interact in any way except in a bonus room where you can shoot out a couple of things into the air that do nothing. What a ridiculous waste of money!","Sep 7, 2018 at 1:45 AM",1, 10,"Hey Alicia_Wonderland: we are sorry that you were not enjoying our experience. Of course the feeling of beauty is personal preference.

2022-05-28 19:39:21.290248,Mikrocell,Beautiful and Relaxing - Well Done,"Gorgeous - like watching a laser light show in a planetarium... but better.  The main feature is a 3D movie tour of some amazing worlds.  

You start out in space and then dive in to an alternate inner world three times.

It also has two interactive worlds that aren't movies.  You get to interact and create beautiful fire-works like effects.  

Finally a bonus 3D movie that is in some ways more amazing than the main attraction movie.  The bonus is too short, but just long enough to not be a tease.  

More please!","Sep 5, 2018 at 10:05 PM",5, 9,Hey Mikrocell: thanks you so much and enjoy.
