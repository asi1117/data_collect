The game does suffer from lack of full locomotion - instead you teleport. Unfortunately I can't change language - and I got Norwegian language even though I'm Danish and the game should support Danish. Would be nice to be able to select English language too. Also it seems that the game hasn't been tested with high levels of super sampling, although the game feels reasonably optimized, this simple game is more damanding than let's say Windlands 2 and Mage's Tale, so I guess this game could be further optimized to lower hardware requirements. After playing for about 15-20 minutes I got some severe stuttering causing me to exit the game. I'm using GTX 1080, i7 7700K and 16GB 3200 Mhz.","Nov 2, 2018 at 4:24 AM",3, 7,
