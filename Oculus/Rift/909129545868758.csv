2022-05-28 11:57:07.808256,UndeadEdd,quite apptly named,"quite apptly named, this platformer game with horrible fixed camera positions coupled with horrible inaccurate movement will require a lot of luck to pass, let alone collect all the collectibles on your way. want to make a small step on a tiny platform? sorry, our psychotic fox will lunge forward and fall into the water!

2022-05-28 11:57:07.823217,Ironbug78,Top Platformer for VR,"I have not had as much fun in a platformer since Mario 64.  Lucky's Tale is a great platformer that is easy to play and makes full use of VR. You will be running, jumping and collecting coins all well taking out the bad guys. This game feels great, its like you are in a chair floating in Lucky's world controlling him. Must play for any platform lover. My only downer about the game, is its not cross buy. Now I have to buy it again for my Quest to play on the go.",Jan 22 at 9:24 PM,5, 4,
2022-05-28 11:57:07.838176,belokk,Great Platfomer for VR,"I have played this on my friends Oculas Rift back when the game lauched and I was hooked. Years later when after playing Super Lucky's Tale and ""New"" Super Lucky's Tale, I finally bought an Oculas Quest 2 and this was the first game I wanted to play. I was pleased that I am able to play this Gem and actually finish the game on my Quest 2. Very pleased that AirLink allowed me to stream this from my PC to the headset. This is a must buy game for anyone that likes platformers. I would love to have a Mario game that is as immersive as this game is.",Oct 18 at 3:46 AM,5, 8,
2022-05-28 11:57:07.854133,benjamin.haines.9889,Please do a Quest port or continuation!,"Playing this game gives you such a joyful feeling! Being released in 2016 Lucky's Tale is an early VR game but still 5 years later it's a TON of fun and is so wonderful and colorful. I would love if Lucky would someday return to his VR roots, however. The Quest 2 has sold more units than every previous Oculus headset combined. I can understand in 2017 making the sequel non-VR but in 2021 there's a MUCH larger market for VR, especially on Quest. Oh developers of the wonderful Lucky's Tale, please bring Lucky back to his roots someday! I haven't played the non-VR sequel so I don't know how feasible it would be on the Quest but with the Quest a success it should be looked into! Thank you for creating such an awesome game that still holds up years later! :D","Apr 22, 2021 at 6:40 PM",5, 22,

2022-05-28 11:57:11.028842,ClassicGamerNL,Love to see this game come to Quest,I have enjoyed this game since the first demonstration on the Oculus Rift DK2 and I really hope the devs did not abandon VR. It would be great to see Lucky back on the Quest. If you have never played Lucky and you are a fan of platformer games this is a must have! Lucky's Tale is one of the platform games availble for Rift.,"Mar 2, 2021 at 3:56 AM",5, 9,

2022-05-28 11:57:14.174449,AVexed-PredaNerd,A tale for all ages,So my daughter was obsessed with this game literally the only VR game she would play for awhile so I gave it a try and I have to admit it's very fun. The third person veiw from high up really let's you admire the landscapes adding a perspective of immersion old platformers just can't deliver. Great for people who might experience motion sickness in games with first person pov. Plus they allow you to use your touch controller as a gamepad Wich is always a win in my eyes!,"Oct 20, 2020 at 4:46 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 11:57:14.251244,kulakon,Great easy going platformer,"Once you get past the somewhat intro that's clearly aimed at children game turns out to be cracking little platform coin collector. Yes, its a blantant rip off of Mario with even some hint of Sonic, but so what? 

The envirnoment is far from Hi res, think cartoony cell shaded graphics but i think this just adds to the atmosphere. This isnt a game to take too seriously, its a game i dip into to warm up with.

The gameplay and mechanics are super smooth and responsive its, easy to get into a flow and a rhythm and the very simple 'combat' is  all you need with basically two moves. Each level can be played through three times, story mode, Red coin collection and speed runs.  This gives the game real replay value and i think makes it a cracking bargain.

Look past the some of the aspects that are certainly aimed at children and there is plenty of fun to be had here. The difficulty generally increases as you progress, hardcore platform gamers may find it a little easy but as an average gamer, some of the levels took a couple of attempts and several lives to complete.

This isnt quite on the same level as Moss but treat it as a casual arcade style platfomer and you wont be disappointed.","Sep 19, 2020 at 3:09 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 11:57:17.425805,XtremeHardcoreGamer,Good platformer.,Not my cup of tea but it is of high quality and done well. Too much like Mario but still good. Wish part 2 was VR also- seems like they used this to flesh that one out. They could've made it for both 2d and VR but what do I know?,"May 4, 2020 at 4:36 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 11:57:20.535541,ElijahRio,Very Cool Game,"I like this game but I suck at it! I'm terrible at platforming games but it is fun. The game looks gorgeous and it runs like a charm. The PC viewing experience for people that want to watch the VR player is diabolical. Like how can you see what's going on? It's tiny!!!
ANother thing, this game is rated a 'moderate' for VR comfort. I didn't expect it but I get very sick playing this game. Now it only really happens in Payday 2 and a game like Boneworks is not an issue so it's kind of odd.","Apr 9, 2020 at 4:45 AM",4, 0,

This game looks so beautiful! The game is fun with hidden gems and puzzles. I recommend this game if you have little ones that are not ready for Zombie VR games yet.","Nov 28, 2019 at 5:16 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 11:57:20.581418,SnowyCoder,Really enjoyable for a free game,"It had some problems with the audio engine switching off sometimes but it's just the perfect game to let off some steam at the end of the day. The awesome art and animations give a lighthearted touch to the experience. Would suggest to anyone who owns an Oculus.
Another problem that I should report is that the camera doesn't always follow the player and the controls feel a bit uncomfortable in some parts (like when I need to walk down a narrow path I always tend to fall because I don't get the orientation right).","Nov 22, 2019 at 5:02 AM",4, 2,

Lucky and his world is adorable; I found myself talking to him and waving when he waved at me (even though that did nothing lol). The collectibles are moderately challenging which gives the game some replay value.

I got a little motion dizzy when I first started and I wouldn't let me daughter ""play"" it I just jumped around and let Lucky wave to her while she had the rift on.

2022-05-28 11:57:33.173670,Meiisan,"Free, but ... meh.","Considering it's a free game, I have to give it some slack. Everybody has to start somewhere with a free VR game when they just get a system. This is my frist download outside of the Oculus home world. And I have t osay that I think it's really boring and basic. I mean, it's great that these worlds can look so cool, but this is just a really generic platformer that does nothing to innovate despite the 3D invironment. You can even ""interact"" with the character by ""touching"" him, but that's even lame. You just get close to him and get does 1/3 preset animations. No touching or physics or any interaction to the player. I do like some of the perspectives, but art means nothing when the game is boring. I'm not the biggest platformer fan, but platformers did good back in the day because each one had their own innivations. This one has nothing besides the VR gimic. It's a free game that's worth a try if you like the genre. But I can't really say I enjoyed it outside of the first 20 minutes.","Mar 17, 2019 at 6:25 PM",3, 5,

2022-05-28 11:57:33.219547,Jarom,An absolute delight!,Charming and fun casual platformer. There may be tons of similar screen games out there like this but having it in VR makes you just want to stay and enjoy the world. The amount of craft and skill that the Playful team has is definitely shown in full force here. For the squeemish make sure to play in short increments though as the camera pans freely with Lucky and can cause discomfort. Absolutely worth the effort though. My only regret is that Super Lucky's Tale is not available for VR also but I look forward to playing Star Child on day one.,"Jan 6, 2019 at 1:34 PM",5, 4,

Remember when you first played Mario 64 and thought WOW!  Well, that's this game.  I'm only on level 2, so I'm not sure how much longevity it has, but I really like it just for the graphics and gameplay -- how it looks like you're watching a model world come alive, how you can look around things (like BEHIND the rafters when underground for coins), etc.

Also, apparently I have a stomach of steel or something, I haven't gotten the least bit sick with this (or any other app for that matter).

2022-05-28 11:58:33.156537,Squadaloo,A Solid Platformer Lacking in Variety,"Lucky's Tale is a solid platformer with tight and responsive controls.  Lucky handles exactly the way you'd expect him to in every situation making the game incredibly easy to pick up and play: it's the same kind of tight controls you'd expect in a Nintendo-made platformer.  The game also looks great: unlike the similar Super Mario 3D World/Land, the levels look like you're actually traveling through a world instead of a bunch of platforms floating in the sky.


Unfortunately, the game feels very much like the developer was testing the waters with the VR platformer concept.  It's very short: I beat the main story in less than two hours without even trying to rush.  There's some extra challenges for replayability but I'd prefer a longer length.  Also, the environments and enemies lack variety.  You've seen most of the enemies in the game by the end of the second world and the environments lack variety: the first half of the game mostly takes place in woods and the second half mostly in ruins.  There's a couple of slight twists on these environments in a couple of levels, but it's not enough to stop the sameness creeping in.


It's a good debut game and I really wish the sequel were in VR as it would give me more incentive to try it to see if it fixed my issues.","May 27, 2018 at 10:27 AM",4, 3,

The problem I had was that the game uses a floating camera that moves automatically, it's very jarring and made me nauseous and dizzy almost immediately. I even almost lost my footing. No other VR games have caused me any discomfort outside of excessively long  play sessions. I couldn't play this game for more than about five minutes at a time without seriously making myself sick. It’s a shame too because I believe that a lot of effort went in to this game, the art, music, and controls are all nice, but that work goes to waste when the game itself is this uncomfortable to play.","Feb 6, 2018 at 11:55 AM",2, 3,

2022-05-28 11:58:49.075522,Vantablack_,Pretty 3D Jump ’n’ Run,"I would recommend this game to kids, because I am too old for this and it is pretty easy. There no big challenge or interesting action in this game. The VR expierence is pretty low too, because this game was not made to be VR. There are only a few thing which looks pretty cool in VR like the main menu where u select levels.
Furthermore you should not play it when you get motion sickness as easy as me. I can only play it for a few minutes, even tho the camera moves pretty slow. 
So well if you like such jump and runs, you should buy it. But I think this game is pretty boring.","Feb 8, 2018 at 3:04 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 11:58:52.165401,diontheunstable,TERRIBLE choice in general,"This game is... I'm not sure where to start, really. It would have been okay if it wasn't VR, for starters. As it IS VR, the way the camera works and can't be controlled, and moves to its own groove, makes me sick faster than any vehicle game. This is the reason I have a pack of ginger gum on my desk, and while it seems to help with others, does NOTHING for this game. The headache and nausea take about five minutes to manifest at an unbearable level.

The gameplay would be fine with a standard controller outside of VR, but the mechanics of the 3D and camera interaction mean you're forced to take all sorts of weird actions that make the motion-sick even worse, in a game that, again, would have been okay in a 2.5D sidescrolling platformer, Crash Bandicoot-style.

As I couldn't play it for more than a few minutes, I can't give a story rating, because it's just that bad.

You guys could have had just about any other game bundled with it, but you went with this. The bundled game is supposed to demonstrate the capabilities. The fun. Get someone happy about their purchase and eager for more, rather than looking to pawn off the system on someone else. 

Lone Echo is amazing. Elevator to the Moon is pretty good. I Expect You To Die is great too. Now... I understand the difficulties in selling the motion controllers and the headset separately, but use something like Obduction, or another exploration game, not something that throws the players into the deep-end of physical endurance.","Jan 15, 2018 at 7:13 PM",1, 3,

The platforming is quite basic, it's no Mario Bros but it certainly has its charm and most importantly, it proves that platforming has a place in the VR landscape! 

The controls are spot-on, the music and the colors are delightful and the hub areas and the secret levels look especially wonderful. 

There is a lot of replay value, coins to be collected, time challenges to be bested, but I can't see myself going back to those with the lack of variation in gameplay.

2022-05-28 11:59:30.223149,QuakingInMyOats,Of all the games to cause sickness...,"I may have only had my VR device for two days, but I'm no stranger to the platform.  I've been playing for about a year now, first with a borrowed GearVR device (I had plenty of fun with fan ports of Quake with joystick locomotion and high speeds) then with RiftCat on a cheap Cardboard headset.  From Redout, to bhopping in Quake, to Minecraft, nothing ever gave me nausea without an extended period of play and framerate drops to finish the job.

This game, however... it started out with so much promise.  The platforming mechanics feel great.  The controls for Oculus Touch work are well thought out.  The environments look brilliant, with a nice aesthetic and a good backdrop to look around.  However, the moment I approached the edge of the camera my praise for the game ended.

This game has THE worst camera I have EVER seen in a VR game.  It has a smooth motion, no visual references (e.g. a floating platform with guardrails that you could be standing on), and no control whatsoever.  Perhaps I could grit my teeth if I were sitting down, but even then the feeling of smoothed motion that is entirely out of your hands... I was feeling sick in mere minutes.

If you're new to the Rift as I am, I highly recommend skipping this one until further notice.  If they ever patch the game to allow desktop mode, or simply allow the right thumbstick to control the camera from a first-person catwalk/platform, I'd give this game another shot-- until then, it's the perfect example of how one flaw can completely topple an entire VR game.","Aug 13, 2017 at 6:44 AM",2, 7,

I'm not convinced being in VR adds anything to the experience since it's still a 3rd person game, but still, it's well executed. It plays well with both the xbox and touch controllers.

The only issue I have with it is the camera positioning is problematic at times. A chase cam would be much more useful than the side scroller style camera. This is especially true since it isn't a side scroller. Yes, you can move your head around, but this is clearly intended as a seated game, so your movement is limited.","Aug 19, 2017 at 11:30 AM",4, 0,

The colorful environments, the animation and the controlls were spot on.
I especially like the parts when our hero jumps down the rabit holes for the mini games, I thought it was a very nice touch.

My only wish for this title (and I'm sure it been said before) is for there to be way to pan the camera around with the right stick.

The mechanics are a little shallow and the level design is good but not great.

It's got all the classic trappings with coins, gems, hidden secrets, it feels like an old platformer in the same vein as Crash Bandicoot and the VR aspect of it creates a certain perspective of looking at a table full of miniatures that brings the charm to a whole new level. I love this game to death, which makes me so remarkably sad to have to knock a star off for the fact that I get some pretty heavy VR sickness when playing it to the point where I can't go much further than the second level.

Lucky's Tale brings the classic 3D gameplay to the VR platform and it is executed really well.

You feel like you are looking at a little magical toy world and there is a lot of amazing details. If you put your head close to Lucky, he will wave at you.

Not only is the gameplay spot on but the soundtrack to this game is also really good. My favorite being the underwater level, really brings memories back to underwater levels from games like Donkey Kong Country and Mario 64.

The thumbstick-controlled camera is yet another textbook example of bad motion controls for VR.
