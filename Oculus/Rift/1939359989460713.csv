Second time around I had a bit more patience and boy was it worth it! A very, very good VR experience. Not really a game, more like an interactive animation, but one of very high quality.

It's more detailed than a textureless experience we usually see, and not live action.  It's a shame I can't find more experiences like this. I only watched it on the Quest so far. 

Tip: The 3D makes it a tiny bit blurry for me, so I turn it off by clicking the menu on a part of the movie I'm not watching, and the rest of the area becomes 2D smooth.","Jul 1, 2020 at 12:23 PM",5, 6,

Using a GTX 1080 I could crank up super sampling to 2.0 and still get solid 90 fps, so this app is greatly optimized. Sound/voices/music, story and graphics were all perfectly made, you can't go wrong with this movie - and maybe best of all, it's free. Compared to similar VR movies, the duration is quite long - about 20 to 25 minutes. Unlike The Bond, this movie is perfect for (young) kids - well, it's probably mostly made for young kids, but their parents will have an awesome time watching this movie too :-) BTW, in some scenes there're interactions using Touch, still it's something quite easy to do even for young kids. The movie can be enjoyed sitting, but I'd recommend to watch it standing - at least when watching it for the first time.","Nov 16, 2018 at 4:35 AM",5, 77,

Five stars for the graphics/concept of immersing yourself to witness a Pixar style movie in an environment.   But there are no subtitles so I can't follow along with the story.

Also, Oculus Store needs a ""Subtitles: Yes / English"" field in the list of features.  Steam does this, and so should Oculus.  

Some innovation will be needed in VR subtitles (e.g. chat balloons above characters, or floating traditional subtitles under them, or some other technique) but we should not set a precedent to have no subtitles for the deaf, hearing impaired, and hard of hearing.   

Oculus adding a ""Subtitles: None"" vs ""Subtitles: English"" field to the features list will help.  (P.S. I am a software developer, and adding subtitles is not hard).","Dec 31, 2018 at 2:33 PM",1, 6,

The interactivity feels forced.
The character and environment design is... A little weird.
Animation's solid, (and strangely seems to run at 24FPS, but whatever.)
Voice acting sounds good and works well.
I don't have too strong an opinion on the sound design.
The presentation is well done. It does a good job of guiding your eyes when needed, and leaves little ambiguity about what's happening.

I knew Baobab Studios from their previous VR short Invasion!, which came out at around the same time the Rift launched.  Invasion! was brilliant - but Crow the Legend is orders of magnitude better.

Not only is the animation better, the story more meaningful, the acting/voiceovers fantastic, but the look and feel of the production is Pixar quality, and the length is much longer.  This allows for a more nuanced, impactful story.

2022-05-28 17:12:29.608871,goonie,This is not VR. It's a linear 360 video.,"This is not a VR experience; it's a 360 degree video. A perfect example of a modern-day Hollywood animation studio doing what it does best but absolutely in the wrong medium. Hollywood doesn't understand VR. This has no interaction (waving arms, really?), no room presence, no feedback, no social component, no building/saving, no sense of self-presence (no visible avatar, no consistent perspective) no internet connectivity, almost no use of the microphone or controls... This is just watching a movie, which is better done sitting in a chair, sharing some popcorn with family and friends in front of a nice screen. To be fair, the animation, graphics, frame-rate, polish, and sound-design is on par with other Hollywood animation movies--but that doesn't matter; it's not VR. I would rather watch a screen, which has been carefully framed by directors, than have to hunt around looking for what I'm supposed to be looking at, while an animation plays on, in completely linear, non-interactive, movie fashion, regardless of what I'm doing. No amount of Hollywood celebrity attachment, earned ""Award"" marketing, paid reviews, bug-free polish, or even free distribution makes up for the fact that this is literally hackneyed animation studio, song-n-dance stuff, which has been around for decades. It's the same old stuff. You may not even sit through if it was on DVD. Believe me, I wanted to love this. It could have been great. Anyone who has had to sit through lengthy ""cut scenes"" on a videogame, for example, would understand the critical and missing amount of potential here. Calling a basic linear Hollywood animation a VR experience is like calling a book a board game. If you want to stand for 20 minutes and swing your head around and virtually do nothing else but wave your arms around when prompted while looking at an animation, here you go. If you want a true virtual reality experience, you may not want to waste the time downloading and sitting through this.","Nov 23, 2018 at 2:38 AM",2, 3,

The quality of the animation itself is absolutely top notch, this is easily content you would expect from a brand new feature film release, with wonderful characters and colours and lovely design style. The VR component primarilly works to put you there, and really feel like you're inhabiting this world - I was craning my neck in my seat to follow the action as it moved all around me. The use of hand presence will undoubtedly be a big hit for children watching this, using their hands to control the seasons, but it's also quite fun as an adult - conducting a space opera is pretty darn sweet!

The narration sounded a little disjointed right at first, and it sounded a little odd for the main character to be singing in what sounded like a small, hard surface room instead of the forest he was pictured in... but in the land of make-believe, things aren't supposed to necessarily make sense.  You will play a small role as one of the supporting characters, but I didn't grasp why that was needed.  I started to watch the story from a chair, but found it easier to be standing so I could enjoy the entire atmosphere.

I feel like this was a nice attempt though but I was turned off by the whole lag situation (50% headroom and then some) it was definitely the animation and not performance of my hardware (gtx 1080ti, I7 6700k, 32 gig ddr4 2133, 5500 gb ssd) Let me know if you fix those issues in the animation and I will complete the story.
