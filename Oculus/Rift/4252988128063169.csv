2022-05-28 20:05:39.526249,dxawn,fun!,"its great. all i wish is that they added a sandbox mode and maybe a menu and better options screen as they have an ipad in the hub for settings and  whenever you load the game there's no options. the gun sounds are pretty good, but they could use some work. such as the shotgun sounding the same as pistol just edited (im being picky) and the sounds from the rifles are not very realistic. all in all its a good game that could use some details.",Jan 25 at 6:20 AM,5, 0,"I would definitely like to improve upon some of the rifle sounds in the future. Currently the game does have unique sound effects for all 18 weapons (for handling and firing, suppressed and unsuppressed) however some of them may be similar. The shotguns should be quite different to the pistols though... I'll take another look at this soon. 

Also, the games options should always be available on the tablet when the game loads. If the options tablet isn't working correctly for you, please could you email concreteboxvr@gmail.com and I'll investigate that right away. 

The aim for Shotwood has always been to drop you into the world as soon as it loads, and have every aspect of the experience handled through real-world style interactions inside (with physical button panels and touchscreens). This is why the options tablet exists, and no start-up menu screen is offered. I will have a think about ways to possibly improve the options/settings experience in the future though.

Thanks for the feedback!"

Pros:
Amazing Music
Pretty good firearms (Could Use Work)
Plenty of content for $12 bucks USD.
Sound of weapons so far is okay.


Cons:
Like I said above firearms could use some work. 
No real AI ro shoot at just moving targets but they are okay.

I dont do reviews I mainly just wanted to tell the dev how greatful we all are that they are bringing a new game for us to enjoy on the PCVR Oculus store front :)",Dec 16 at 4:59 PM,5, 3,"Thanks for the feedback, it's honestly really appreciated. Be sure to look up the music artists in the credits, they're phenomenal! You can find their logos hidden on crates throughout the game too."
2022-05-28 20:05:39.558164,DACopperhead,Delightful surprise,"I can't fully explain why, but THIS is the VR game I end up come back to whenever I put on my headset. It is simple, visceral fun. The atmosphere is pretty good, and overall is just great.",Jan 8 at 2:16 PM,5, 2,That's great to hear. Thanks for posting a review!
2022-05-28 20:05:39.576117,Dio,Anger managment...,"This one help with that, but it will make your nerves go south ! I do not do reviews but this one I had to comment on. 
First off, I love this game ! You'll love the announcer for 1.
Targets puke and shoot back and sometimes not a fair fight. Hehe
The weapons are cool ! I The action on them are good but I find the scope has a hell of a time zeroing in on a target !
If I may offer an idea. Make the game Easy, Normal and with the other suggestion Hardcore. As it is right now I'm getting killed because of a spawn right beside me or right behind me leaving me with a firing squad ! Hehe I kid you not, better be awake on this one cause it is a real challenge. Heartrate soars !
Oh and one more thing. I love the silencers.
I'm giving it 5 stars because it hits all of my marks.
Fun, the challenges are pretty hard to get. Took me a couple of times to nail them. The price is good for what I see now.
Oh and I forgot, I like the mini games also !

Later

EDIT: The hip shotgun is pretty hard to shuck the new rounds in place. My controller is having head bangers symptoms. Pun inteded hehe

EDiT EdiT : Will do on the e-mail.",Nov 29 at 11:29 PM,5, 5,"Awesome, thanks for the feedback! The scope alignment will be relaxed in a future update, to make it easier/faster to use. I'll have a think about adding some difficulty options too, that might be possible soon.

UPDATE: I've just spotted your edit today. Thanks for letting me know about the shotgun - at the moment the pump action grip will follow your controllers' forward and backward movements as soon as it unlocks (when you shoot). If your controllers are very close together when it unlocks, you'll need to move your hands apart first before you can fully pump the shotgun, otherwise you won't have enough physical space to complete the motion. I'll see if I can improve this in the next update. I can also confirm that the relaxed scope alignment will definitely be included in the next update, as well as a brand new mode for all assessment floors... This update will be out in the next few weeks! Also, feel free to email concreteboxvr@gmail.com directly with any future feedback, as it'll get spotted much faster. Thanks again!"

A note to dev, It would be cool to have a hardcore mode where you get given a certain amount of mags for the gun and you need to keep them and refill them from the box of ammo you buy. It would be a nice little boost to immersion.",Nov 15 at 11:11 PM,5, 4,"That's really great to hear. I can't make any promises about a hardcore mode yet, but I'll certainly have a think about it. Thanks for the feedback!"
