2022-05-28 20:30:21.330259,Reachrehab,Early Version,"Developer's note:  This application is in early stages.  Much value is added by taking time to review range of motion session data  through the web portal.  Would encourage any users to experience this in VR, but then goto the personalized web portal to see a visualization of motion.","Oct 12, 2020 at 11:54 PM",3, 4,

2022-05-28 20:30:21.361177,sproketz,Seems like a phishing app,"Very lightweight app that won't show your results in app. You have to go onto a website and give them your email. Seems like it's phishing

Updated: The developer contacted me (below) to let me know the issues I have are due to early access and they don't have in-app results yet.  Still, it would be good to alert people upfront that they won't be able to get any info before they go through the experience. Right now you don't know that's going to be the case and go through the evaluation, just to not be able to get your results at the end. Some more transparency at the start would go a long way here.

If email is required, ask for it upfront.","Sep 2, 2020 at 3:52 AM",2, 4,"Reach Shoulder Health is currently in Early Access and serves as a tool for you to capture a volumetric profile of your current shoulder movement abilities. We provide detailed reporting on your shoulder health that is best accessed in a web browser rather than VR, and that is why we ask for your email. We take our users privacy seriously and creating a Reach account with us is completely optional and not necessary if you do not want to view your reports. Thank you for your comment though, as it helps us understand what could potentially be in the minds of other people as well"
