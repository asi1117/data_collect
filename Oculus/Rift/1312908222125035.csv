Oculus stand alone version works fine on both of them but PCVR supports were messed and gone forever. I've checked the ForceTubeVR_API_x64.dll files in Oculus and STEAM PCVR installation folders. It's there but no connection was made to the devices. It all works fine with other games like ONWARD, PAVLOV, and Contractors.

2022-05-28 13:23:41.512110,mak8tack,"Almost great, but still love it!","I'm a city dweller with too many hobbies as it is. Also a former soldier, this is a great way to bring me back to the range inexpensively. The MK18 is the only modeled firearm, without the DLC, that I am most familiar with (the lack of a M16A2 or M1911 makes me a little sad) but I have to say that select fire switch has me truly confused. It seems to be modeled wrong, with the ""handle"" selecting the fire mode/safe, and the ""indicator"" pointing to the opposite to what's stamped on the receiver. For example, ""safe"" is actually ""auto"" while semi is almost correct -- I think the thumb handle should be rendered in the down position. Anyway, I'm just enjoying the sandbox/indoor firing range!","Feb 11, 2021 at 9:57 PM",4, 15,

2022-05-28 13:23:41.557987,Trittyburd,"Really fun, but fix the sounds!","I've mostly played the Quest version, but everything seems to be the same here except that I don't see any sign of the SWAT DLC on PC nor the joystick movement. Almost everything about this game is great except for the WW2 stealth sniper missions and, the biggest offense, the sound effects.

TLDR: Audio needs an overhaul.
The majority of the guns have a weird audio pop at the end of the shooting sound, evident with the Deagle and MP5, the shooting sounds are not correctly matched with the guns with most of them being far too powerful, the Garand ping is... odd, and the shotguns are horrid with the artillery cannon fire sound and whatever that pump sound is.
If either the audio pops are removed or the pump sound is changed, I'll be happy.","Jan 2, 2021 at 11:50 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 13:23:41.572947,Cajin,An alright shooting range,"I'm not a pro at shooting but I do have experience  from personal hobby to Army veteran. 

The pros
The experience of shooting pop up targets, hostage situations,  zombies, and the large assortment of weapons. 
The Visual effects are good.
The weapon mechanics are not to far off. Another good feature is that it's Cross compatible with the Quest. The Quest version is also nice and you won't be tethered to your pc.

The cons
The menus are not user friendly. You will have to get used to the menus and locations.
Sometimes changing magazines can be a hit or miss, and sometimes a not at all.
Sometimes the programing will spawn me in a crate and the crate will be gliching on my arm.
You will need at less 6 feet of space because there are times pop up targets are behind the buildings and you can't see them unless you walk around the corner, and it is critical because sometimes they have hostages. 
Sometimes there are location changes behind large crates, and when you warp to locations you will have to reorient yourself.

My overall is it is a nice shooting range game that needs some work, and can be great. If you want a game to freshen up your aiming or need some experience with gun Mechanics in real life this does not have real shooting physics but it is a fun arcade shooter. Plus you can play the Quest version which is just as good and not worry about cables.","Oct 12, 2020 at 11:02 PM",4, 23,
2022-05-28 13:23:44.673486,cybernettr,Controls are a little quirky,"Good to get a little gun practice for the coming real life apocalypse, but I find the game mechanics a little quirky. Looking at your left hand in the game, your first finger closes in when you squeeze the trigger, your other fingers close when you squeeze the grip and your thumb closes in when you press on the thumb pad. But unlike in real life, you do not use all of your fingers to remove a spent cartridge from a handgun! You must use your grip button only or you will get inconsistent results. But the grip is also the control you use for two-handed grabbing your weapon as well as cocking the pistol￼￼! This could be better thought out.","Feb 11, 2021 at 12:25 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 13:23:44.690440,Diamond_Pugs,Not just a shooting range!,"I wasn't interested in this game at all, but it was on sale, and on the forums everyone was recommending it so I decided to pull the trigger, and I'm glad I did. This game is way more than just a shooting range. It feels more like those old arcade shooting games like House of the Dead, but better since it has a ton of realistic weapons and mods, more levels, zombies, nazies, terrorists, and all with the full immersion of VR, and in between shooting levels you will spend hours customizing your guns making your perfect, and sometimes over the top, weapon.

It is a buy on PCVR and a must buy on the Quest.","Aug 7, 2020 at 11:40 AM",5, 13,

A stack of weapons to choose, from pistols, rifles, shotguns, machine guns including all the classic models. Been having a blast with pistols however when I decided to get a shotgun, I found that I could not figure out how to load the shells. I grab shells with my left hand and when I bring my hand up to the gun, I just have a bunch of shells that I can't do anything with. I know I'm missing something but there's no help or guides that tell you the controller button definitions for particular types of weapon.

Then I bought it again on oculus store and still play it almost everyday.  Maybe Gun Club VR is not the best as a gun SIMULATION, but as a GAME it is the best. If you are looking for a fun (and sometimes challenging) shooting range game, this is it.  

What I found most interesting is I can go 'Action' ranges over again with different kind of weapons. Different kind of weapon makes same missions totally different.  I recommend high level action ranges with only a default pistol.  You've got to shoot the head every target and reload in perfect timing.

2022-05-28 13:23:51.056158,TR1PP1N,"Addicting, Action-Packed Gunplay!","This is the best example of a simple, arcade-style ""shooting gallery"" game on Rift I have witnessed so far. On the surface it may seem just like another carnival game... but it goes deeper than that...

There is a wide selection of realistic firearms of different types that handle uniquely and realistically, and plenty of upgrades and interchangeable accessores to experiment with. Any skilled player should be able to complete all challenges 100% without having to use most of these options, but they definitely have a positive performance impact if employed properly, and are simply fun to try out and mix together. 

In terms of core gameplay, there are a couple different locations and a few different game-modes for each one, all revolving around basic range-style plinking, but with a few twists. 

Besides basic animated target practice, Action stages tactically engage the player with enemies from position-to-position in each environment, while negotiating hostage situations requiring careful shot placement (eg. Time Crisis), and there are zombie challenges as well to test your firepower and bravery. Specialized game modes (such as the Sniper ladder) employ even more unique scenarios that will have you steadying your nerves and exercising your decision-making skills until you sweat. Targets sometimes even seem to have an ""AI"" like ability to engage with the player! 

Sandbox mode is there for people who just want to mess around and test the limits of the game engine, or simply ""try it before you buy it"" when shopping for guns and accessories. 

There are some instances where the touch controls can feel a little awkward (such as using your off-hand to steady weapons, or look through a scope) - However, any basic action (grabbing, aiming, firing, reloading, pushing, throwing) is tracked well and feels very engaging and refined.

What makes this game real ""five star"" material are the details and consistency.

2022-05-28 13:23:54.148004,OiYou,Well! this is embarrassing,"I will leave my original post intact, someone might find it useful. I need to add the devs responded quickly and only then did I start figuring out how to use the touch controllers effectively when handling the different weapons. In my defense, it is a tricky game to get to grips with if you are new to VR (or maybe it's just me) but once I got more practiced it wasa very rewarding

This is very frustrating - The game looks amazing and, when I can get it to work it is a lot of fun. I simply could not get the 'hands' to act as intended. Trying to charge a weapon always resulted in it grabbing the magazine. The movement mechanic in the sandbox was glitchy and too often I was left randomly pushing controler buttons trying to figure out how to make things work.  I have now spent so much timer trying to get this to work that I have pretty much given up with it now. I would like this game a lot if it worked so lets hope they keep working on fixing the rift s touch controllers issue. It is worth noting I am new to VR so if the devs, or anyone else has suggestions of what I could do diffrently I am open to suggestions. Frankly I have wasted hours trying to get this working and have pretty much given up with it now.","Nov 4, 2019 at 10:28 AM",4, 13,

I own a few of these guns and fired a few others at the range, and I've got to admit, each gun functions as it would in real life. Solid graphics and pretty intuitive gameplay make this a must own.

2022-05-28 13:23:57.339140,MetallicTempest,Best vr gun range imo,"I've tried a few but I like this one the best and can spend the most time in it. There's a few but I like how realistic the guns are in this one. You've got to learn how to opperate them. The modes and levels really are a good fit for the game. I'm not sure why there isn't more like this. It seems like this formula would would really well in a ""Time Crisis"" style game with actual 3D enemies instead of just targets. But this gets close to that feeling with a way smaller budget. I really hope aspects of this game make it into next generation VR games. It just makes other reload methods feel wrong. I don't want to press R, or shoot off screen, or drop the gun, or bring it to my waist. I like actually dropping the magazine and grabbing another one. 

If Time Crisis made a game in VR, then I'd want them to work with this team on it. You don't need tons of player movement to make a VR shooting game fun. It's sort of the opposite end of the spectrum from Arizona, Super Hot, and Robo Recall, but it works, it's a solid game, it's fun to demo to friends, and the devs keep updating it.","Sep 16, 2019 at 1:49 PM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 13:23:57.371055,studriver,,"Was great fun - would have given it a 5. Until I bought the new Rift S.

EDIT: They've fixed the problem with the Rift S controllers now.

Simple problem; the new touch controllers have the knuckle ring on the top. So in Gun Club VR, the ring is in the way, and you can't actually bring your hands together in the right position to work the action of a pistol. Simply a problem with the new design of the controllers, so not really a problem with the software; the new controllers didn't exist when it was designed.

Looking forward to an update to support the new controllers! (Though I'll be honest; I much preferred the old controllers to the new ones).

Updated! With the new offset, it's possible to work the slides on an automatic again (I STILL can't get the hang of reloading a revolver...)

More AR 10 types, large caliber belt (box) fed,  Tavor or kriss vector stuff like that, I'm not a wood loving guy when it comes to guns lol.

I did experience one semi-gamebreaking bug in that all the dark stages requiring a flashlight are just grey fog and almost unplayable.

That aside, while there are a large number of stages, modes, guns, and customization, there isn't a whole lot of gameplay here.  1-2 hours and you've seen everything there is to offer unless you want to grind to unlock the rest of the guns/upgrades.  I'd give this 2.5 stars if I could, knocking it down to 2 because of the dark-stage bug.  To be fair, if you are really into guns and just want a very detailed shooting range sim, this would be 4+ stars easily for you.","Jan 31, 2019 at 7:02 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 13:24:06.793106,Azezel,"Great fun, but with a few bugs","The game is fun, could probably use more missions, but you have the sandbox to play around with. 

The good:
-The guns looks and functions feel real
-Reloading feels great
-Customization
-Balanced progression
-Throwing knives at Zombies

The Meh:
-The announcer (at least you can turn him off)
-Needs more missions and more guns (It would be cool if you could make your own missions and share them online.)
-The ability to fire an AK (or any rifle) with maxed out mags, full-auto, one handed, and still maintain accuracy.

The Bad:
-Bugs: sometimes when you grab a rifle your offhand does weird stuff.
On a reload from empty (no round in the chamber) the gun will sometimes auto fire (this is ok for handguns and when rifles are on semi-auto, but terrible when you are on full-auto as it dumps your whole mag into the wall, or floor, or whatever is unfortunate to be at the other end. I'm sorry wooden box, that is always next to you in game, I didn't mean it) At least I haven't found anything game breaking, or any CTD's.
-You can only take one gun with you on missions. I understand why, but it would be more immersive if I could have my rifle and my sidearm on missions especially the WWII and Zombies. You have two holsters on your character, but can't use them both anywhere except the sandbox.

2022-05-28 13:24:06.809063,Billco_Tabarnak,Very polished but could use more content,"This is the first title I bought.  I actually ordered my Oculus Rift after trying Gun Club at a friend's place.  I am no gun nut, but I do find it a ton of fun to go through the missions and challenge myself to reach platinum ratings on all of them.

It is well built, loads quickly, and the gameplay is satisfying.  I liked it as a beginner to VR, and I still like it over a year later.  My main gripe is that I wish there were more weapons and attachments to choose from.  The ones currently in the game are well modeled and each one is unique, but it's still a relatively small selection.  The game isn't particularly realistic, in that you can shoot large rifles one-handed with perfect accuracy, but I don't mind it as it is still lots of fun and lets me focus on the action.  In some ways it recalls fond memories of the Police Trainer"" arcade from the 90's.

If it had a few more weapons available, I would bump it up to 5 stars.  There are more realistic firing range games on the market, but Gun Club is an accessible and enjoyable title that I can play for 2 minutes or 2 hours.","Dec 20, 2018 at 9:34 PM",4, 16,

But for me the worst part is that the challenges don't seem to take into account what kind of gun you are using. Like when I decided to try the shotgun in the WWII area, I was given targets on distant rooftops that would have required a scoped rifle to hit. Which made it impossible to get a good score.

 This is a great game, the graphics are nice, the gunplay is fun and teh scenarios are interesting. The only frustration is the UI... I have purchased 3 of the 'custom' weapons that say ""all attachements unlocked"", yet the only place in teh game I can find to use the attachments are in the 'upgrade' shop and I then have to buy the attachments again. There are also 4 different configs per weapon, but I can't see how to mess about with the attachements to save them in the slots. Based soley on the frustrating UI I can only give this one a 3 star, but if these issues get sorted out, or if it turns out that its me whos thick and there is an option I am missing, the rating will get changed to a 5 (and will do if the devs sort out the missing attachements/UI issues as the gameplay certainly deserves it!)","Sep 8, 2018 at 8:06 PM",5, 2,

I LOVE how the guns load exactly like the real thing (changing the magazine with a round in the chamber saves you from releasing the slide... awesome attention to detail.)  If I were to improve anything, it would be to adjust the scoring.  You should get big bonuses for using iron sights, or fewer upgrades.  As it is, there's no motivation to use anything but a completely tricked out weapon (100-round mag, silencer, laser scope, zombie rounds, etc.).  Another thing I like is that the developer clearly listens to feedback on here, which is very cool.  Awesome game.  Worth every penny.","Jul 27, 2018 at 9:55 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 13:24:16.224619,Mrshawnmars,Definate Favorite VR,"This is the most fun that I have had playing VR.  So much fun that until my notifications popped up saying that there was an update, I didn't even realize that it was an Early Access title. Knowing that it was still in beta when I was playing all those hours and nights have me very excited to move forward with the devs and the game in anticipation of what is next. Every game has downfalls in UI, graphics and physics and this game is no exception. Out of all the shooting VR games on the market this game hits the mark in the fact that you can pick it up and play against fun challenges with the most challenging thing being yourself. Whether I'm trying to beat my best time or getting frustrated that I shot a hostage because I wasn't paying attention and have a hair trigger. This game allows me and my friends to step up and take turns seeing who is the best shot. A suggestion on future updates would be maybe duck hunt-ing (hint hint) or more visual explosions, meaning that a visual fireworks show while shooting would give the eye and ear some awesome visual displays. I don't mean actual fireworks but, there are so many other shooting games where I have to dodge bullets or take cover that honestly gets old after awhile. So, I like the target shooting concept  and beat your own personal best score that this game has with just a bit more eye and ear candy for me to chew on would take it to infinity and beyond...

Loved it before this week's update. Love it more now!  It was missing the target range aspect.  Now with the Sandbox we have it!

Sandbox issues:
1) Only 1 lane allows you to move the target.  Would be nice to have that on all lanes.  Maybe even have a shoot-off with others in the house.
2) The target in the lane doesn't appear to have any reset. So as we try various weapons we can't really tell what's happening. Unless we leave the Sandbox and come back in.  FIXED!  THANKS!
3) Boxes and barrels appear to be hollow.  I immediately wanted to put beer bottles on boxes to shoot them off.  Nope.  They just dropped right through.  FIXED!  THANKS!

Love it! 
Basically spec ops style combat rooms, with various static and mobile wooden enemies to destroy - quickly too, as some shoot back!
Gun handling is good - just love switching mags in the middle of a gun fight with a perfect reload. Having a few issues with cocking a shotgun, but have just sent off for a sensor replacement, so might be that.
To be honest, having the most fun with my Glock, just using the laser/flashlight combo (and some ammo upgrades), and blasting away. Every now and then I just replay some old rooms, for the practice and fun of it - just one of those games.
there are 4 main zones for every class of weapon (and loads of levels with increasing difficulty) - including target shooting (just like the fair, if you were allowed to use autoomatic weapons) and, of course, ZOMBIES!
Considering the models are just cardboard cutouts, the zombie mode can be quite exhilarating if you become overrun.

2022-05-28 13:24:44.678537,TorchMS3,"A great gun game, but can be repetitive.","I actually like this game, and play it late night when I have nothing better to do. I see this as the most accurate VR gun game. The guns in the game are based on real and current weapons with every functionality on them included. Even the safety works. 

    There is a slight learning curve for new players because of the accuracies. You need to pick your gun up and hold it. If you release the side trigger on the holding hand, you'll drop it. You need to load the magazine by picking it from your belt, inserting it in the gun, and then finally charging it.

    You do have an unlimited number of reloads. The game does get progressively more difficult, so watch your bullet count. Reloading before running out means you don't have to charge the weapon which will save you some time.

    The money/points system is pretty good. When you do well in a match, you are awarded cash. You can use that cash to buy new guns and/or modifications. Choose them wisely as some of them really are pointless. 

   As said, it does get repetitive. There are only a handful of different game modes that you complete depending on the type of weapon you have. I hope more dynamic modes come into play. It would be interesting to see some puzzle games incorporated. 

    All-in-all it's a pretty fun and engaging game. You can easily get lost in it, and spend what feels like minutes, but are actual hours passed. There are online tutorials on how to revert it to a new game once you hit a wall due to bad purchase decisions or just too hard to complete. A ""Start Over"" option in the Settings is very much needed.","Feb 12, 2018 at 3:18 PM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 13:24:47.800775,Formation214,Fantastic Game for any gun enthusiast,"I have played Gun Club 3 on the mobile and virtually completed the entirety of it. After updates came far and few in between I stopped playing and eventually forgot about it. Recently getting into VR i noticed Gun Club VR being released, and realised maybe why updates started running short on their mobile genre. When I saw Gun Club VR on sale I decided to give it another whirl even though i already completely knew what to expect.

Gun Club VR has pretty simple gameplay, but the ability to have a high skill ceiling. And to me, its a completely different game from any of its predecessors as such. There is no story or campaign, just a series of target training courses. But its simplicity in execution doesnt mean its easy as the further you progress the targets become tougher and stay up for shorter periods of time, hence the skill ceiling. It is exceptionally good fun for honing reaction speed and mucking around with guns in a fairly non-violent or gory fashion.

However, I only gave it 4 stars as it fails to me on a few things. First of all, the sound is quite honestly archaic. The shooting and reloading sounds are very stock or royalty free, they seem unedited and are exceptionally loud. They are the one thing that makes the experience feel unrealistic and i hope they change them in the future. the next issue is probably more likely to be fixed very soon and that is the over use of the grip button for reloading. Whilst changing a magazine feels satisfying, charging the weapon can be very frustrating as you may grip the gun itself or even grab the magazine that you just loaded in all unintentionally. Perhaps they should use the grip button for magazine switching then the trigger on the non-dominant hand to charge the weapon. Maybe it should be an option as well.

Overall, the game is great fun. I am looking forward to what they are bringing out and fixing the issues above. Im also excited to see how they are going to crack snipers...","Feb 6, 2018 at 8:45 PM",4, 4,

The game feels very arcady yet the later challenges pose a real challenge.

One suggestion I would make to the devs though is: (not sure if this is an oversight or intentional) but don't allow us players to complete the new WW2 challenges using our already max upgraded modern day weapons.

Thanks for the great feedback. You are correct in assuming the two holsters are for holding multiple weapons and we are working on that feature now. We are also currently in development on a few other features like a Sandbox range with free weapon use. 
You can find our roadmap here https://www.facebook.com/GunClubArmory/posts/1476809569061969 which lists  what we're working on. We will add the option to turn off the body onto our list, thanks for suggesting it. Also grenades are particularly useful in the zombie ranges and you can find them in the lobby next to the case.

We have had similar requests for selling weapons and are considering how to best address this.

After playing this game for some time now, there are a few changes / additions that would be nice to see happen. 
   First thing would be to move your chest model up on the player. While playing in the game, it felt as if yor player models shoulders are too low where it would be on my chest and not my actual shoulders. Now maybe it would be possible to adj height by inputing a player hieght.
Second thing id like to see would be the option to mulitple weapons into a round (Primary / Secondary Weapons).
Third would be make the reloading of the shotgun not as much of a nuesence.. I say that because in the game you grab 3 shells at a time and have to put them in, but I find myself reloading with one hand and shoting with the other at the same time.

2022-05-28 13:24:51.016290,TracyAtkins,Best Simulation Ever Made.,"I’m a serious shooter. I spend hours at the range every week, and gobs of money on reloading ammo and firearms. Needless to say, the Early Access version of Gun Club VR caught my eye, and the attention of the people I shoot with regularly.  For us, this game is an easy 10-stars. It is incredibly fun, realistic enough to be a cut above a “game” and has such incredible potential.
Over the course of the months I have completed every single scenario, working to get 4 stars and all cash on each, with each weapon class. It took a lot of practice and long hours of total sweat filled bliss, but I made it through all the game with the top scores. It’s absolutely excellent for “gun nuts” as a fun way to blow off steam without having to spend a c-note on ammo.  We are all buying Rifts just to play this game. For the price of a new pistol, this game makes the Rift worth the purchase price for people that love to shoot.
Thinks I like:
I like the handling of the weapons on the rift controllers.  You get the groove of running the motions, charging the weapons, reloading, point of aim, etc.  Dumping magazines, changing the fire control to safe/semi/full is great. Right there on the thumb controller. Some of the weapon systems are a little complex, like the P90 and Street Sweeper, but you can get the hang of them quickly.  Overall, high marks here, and it can only get better.
I love the scenarios. The standard Hogan’s alley is very well done. Targets pop in and out in random orders, stay up the right amount of time, and are placed well.  I like the mechanics for the mix of armored and unarmored targets, as well as the armed targets with laser pointers. It adds a perfect level of tension, excitement, and urgency to each scenario.","Dec 9, 2017 at 11:10 PM",5, 9,

You can quickly get lots of money so you can play around with guns.  Honestly, the game would have been better if instead of locked guns, they just had locked attachments or preferrably just locked skin colors.  There would be more variety from the start if we were forced to play with different guns versus sticking with one and upgrading the hell out of it to beat the challenges.

To earn money to buy additional weapons, you have to basically play arcade style shooter scenarios.  Not my scene really, trying to figure out a firearm while some dude is yelling at you.

Interface needs work, navigating where you want to go is a little less than straightforward.

I'd suggest two available experiences: one is experimenting with the weapons and then have the shooter games.  Really, I'm not going to spend that much time to have to earn freaking weapons.  I mean you have to invest a serious amount of time to get new weapons. Is it a game or is it an experience? I had thought it was more of an experience.

I cannot rate the level of realism since I don't have any real world gun experience. But every weapon feels and handles different and the gun mechanics are very fun.

4 stars because of the lack of gun range variations. The sound design could also be better. The sound is not affected by the room, this is a huge immersion breaker for me.

The entire game is a series of target practice challenges against pop-up wood cutouts. But this game has you manually reload yourself by ejecting the magazine, grabbing and inserting a new one, and pulling back the slide. Quite stressful to do at first when you're just getting used to it. Very fun, though! Perfect for when you want to kill thrity minutes or an hour.

Thus in the game I am more quick and accurate with the pistol than with the G36K - which is not right.

For the pistols I found all ""upgrade"" sights to be unusable. But it works pretty well as it is.

If I may suggest something:
A black iron sight is pretty hard to see (in VR) against a dark target.

2022-05-28 13:25:22.584296,armegeddon77,Very enjoyable!,"Essentially, this is a shooting gallery with a variety of real-world firearms from four categories: pistols, SMGs, shotguns, and rifles. You fire at targets in a variety of different courses and modes, from a basic tactical simulation (don't shoot the hostages!) to zombies. Well, flat wooden zombies (who still want your brains). /

Don't let the ""wooden target"" thing disuade you, though! The targets pop up as quickly as you can shoot them, and some shoot (or bite) back. In addition, there are time limits in place, as well as a scoring system for each level. As you progress, you'll earn money which will let you buy more weapons and upgrades for said weapons. /

The attention to detail is quite good in most cases! Unlike many other games, Gun Club uses the capacitive sensors on the Touch controller to allow your in-game avatar to exercise proper trigger discipline. That makes the fact that the trigger on the gun model is static rather off-putting, though. /

That said, the grind--as stated in other reviews--feels a bit drawn out. I constantly get the feeling that I'm going to have all of the levels beaten before I even come close to even unlocking all of the accessories for a single weapon, let alone collecting all of the guns. /

Another issue that I keep running into is the position of the menu button. Rather than the dedicated menu button on the Touch controller being used, the B/Y buttons open the menu. This can be a problem when reloading weapons that hold the magazine in the grip, such as the pistols or the TMP. When I follow the magazine up the Y button ends up bumping against the bottom of my right controller, pausing the game. /

Finally, in the zombies game, larger weapons can go through the targets, preventing you from hitting them. I had to stick with my TMP on the later levels to keep that from happening. /

The goods definitely outweigh the bads, though. This game is amazingly fun and I look forward to it getting even better as it nears its full release!","Sep 29, 2017 at 2:38 PM",4, 5,

Worth the money.","Oct 19, 2017 at 8:50 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 13:25:28.927620,DogTailRed2,A good gun simulation.,"I was a bit dubious when I first purchased this game because `The Shooting Range` sounded a little limited in terms of game play. Despite this I like it. As a Brit with no gun experience I like the realism of charging, reloading and firing the guns and I like the ranges which are quite fun to play. I would have given five stars however there are a number of issues I'd like the devs to fix.
When reloading and charging a pistol when  I draw back the slide the game menu appears and freezes the game. I have to click `resume` to continue.
There's no indication that your gun is charged when entering a scenario. In fact if you deliberately re-load your gun in the scenario map room your gun will always be uncharged when entering a scenario?
You can add items to a weapon that is detrimental to it's operation. For example adding a laser sight to the default pistol makes it harder to aim than the iron sights?
I think if these things can be fixed it would make the game a lot more fun.
Looking forward to more updates.","Oct 15, 2017 at 5:41 PM",4, 2,

It lacks features like multiplayer and leaderboards.
Could use options like adjusting the way you grip on the gun (angle seems low). Removing upgrades (maybe its there and I didnt see it).
Changing the button layout for charging your gun (it would make more sense that the trigger and thumb, not the grip button, is used for charging.","Sep 24, 2017 at 8:27 AM",4, 3,"Thanks, that's great feedback.

2022-05-28 13:25:28.984468,Marrt,Very good target range shooter,"Has what almost all games lack: Weapon Angle Selection!

For me the best angle with oculus touch is 23-27°, most other shooters have like 0-15° (0°, what the hell). But here I don't even have to aim for headshots, they come naturally (this game doesn't have autoaim, does it? maybe generous hitboxes)

What could be improved though is the sights. I would like to see:
- different colors on red-dots
- less bloom on reddots (in real life you can adjust brightness)
- pistol-flashlights that dont require that ugly rail, i like my iron sights
- different iron sights for pistols
- Option to map mag-eject to A
- when you insert an empty mag into a gun and pull back the slide, it should stick","Oct 8, 2017 at 8:59 PM",5, 4,"Thanks for the great feedback Marrt!

Definitely not practical when trying to use a scope or any of the sights. The second issue pertains to the challenges. So far, Ive gotten 4 stars on every challenge. However, there are three or four challenges that must be glitched. In game, when I finish the challenge, it gives me 4 stars, but when I go back to the selection screen, it only shows three. Putting these issues aside, this is a great gun game and a big leap forward for making fps games in vr.","Oct 8, 2017 at 12:36 PM",4, 2,"Thanks Dark_Metronix, we will look into the 4 star bug right away.

2022-05-28 13:25:35.322764,Dudikoff,"Fun, but needs more work","My biggest gripe is two weapon handling which seems useless at the moment - the support hand movement doesn't translate into enough movement of the weapon in game. E.g. if the weapon seems to be in the middle of my support hand palm, after moving my hand to e.g. right, the weapon will not move fully with my hand, but will be offset to the left from the center of my palm. Thus, I can't aim with two hands in a fast and natural way, so I have to resort to using them with one hand instead (which is pretty unstable when firing in automatic).

My second gripe is the lack of an attachment UI. It's rather tiring to have to go to a shop and browse to the exact mod just to attach it to your weapon, rather than be able to browse through available mods on the main weapon screen.","Sep 26, 2017 at 3:18 AM",3, 5,"Thanks for the great feedback, two handed weapon handling is something we are focusing on right now.

From the huge selection of guns down to details like making you reload a gun correctly (not just reaching for another gun like in other titles) really make this title a winner. I'm a real life gun owner and visit the range from time to time and aside from the lack of real life recoil feedback this game really does an amazing job of forcing you to learn gun basics. The multiple game modes is a joy as well. I think the addition of zombie mode was genius. I won't spoil it but by the end levels of zombie shooting it gets crazy scary. My friends and I were laughing hysterically at some of the crazy luck shots we were pulling off and doing our best to progress through some of the hard missions.

- Mulitiplayer or PVP against other players or trying to compete for the best time
- Trials for the people who love to get the best speeds and scores on all gamemodes
- Sniper Rifles of course as a interesting challenge to add
- Freemode or Practice range where you can just mess around with attachments and guns and test out different modes for practice and such other than just in the lobby

Be sure to centre yourself using the oculus menu before playing, you should be directly in front of the gun case in the lobby, the default position was a bit far back for me and several levels I spawned inside a wall or crate and dropped my gun as soon as I tried to grab it from the holster.","Sep 25, 2017 at 2:03 AM",4, 1,
