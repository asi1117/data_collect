2022-05-28 19:27:42.013637,Lalle75,Not that complex,"The game mechanics remind me of Box VR. You move your hands to the position of the red an blue targets. Nothing more. No own weapons or tactics.
And the russian translation sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger in RedHeat.","Aug 13, 2019 at 10:47 PM",3, 7,
2022-05-28 19:27:42.028597,WWWyzzerdd,Remember Crackdown on Xbox?,Well this is the black sheep cousin of that game that no one talks about,"Aug 14, 2019 at 2:21 PM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 19:27:42.043557,Labrat228,Minigame,"It is fun as a standalone mini game to work on hand eye coordination, you will get bored quickly.","Aug 20, 2019 at 8:33 AM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 19:27:42.074474,joymode,,this is the best game I ever played. I highly sujest this for every one!!!$$$$$$$$:),"Jun 8, 2019 at 10:57 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:27:45.187148,NOS3D,"Needs polish, but makes kind of fun","I first though its totally boring, but on HARD and a few Levels up it's quite fun. But it really needs some finish - I mean these textures ... come on DEV and build some shaders, I mean that Water plane realy makes me angry ;) And don't use Full body with Arms IK - or put it in an option menu so a user can disable it. VR and arms mostly suck","Mar 23, 2019 at 9:50 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:27:45.201111,Stralisemiai,Good fun,Bought this game in the sale and was worth the money I spent on it. Has the function to use your own music in .ogg format. I wish there was a way to ramp up the game play a little bit to make it a bit harder and buy more things with the credits you earn. Otherwise a fun little game to play.,"Mar 4, 2019 at 9:02 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:27:45.216071,Kuraokami,Awful,Immediately uncomfortable. Hands and body are nowhere close to real-world position. This is priority number ONE: Make the user comfortable. NOBODY will play VR if it makes you uncomfortable!,"Mar 3, 2019 at 6:49 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 19:27:45.231031,FastLawyer,Mediocre rhythm game,"There's little correlation to the beat and to you catching rockets. It's more like catching rockets while you listen to background music. The good news is that you can listen to your own songs if you manually do it & it's very challenging. So if you like catching red or blue projectiles coming hard and fast at you, then go for it. I'm not sure I liked it, but I only paid .99 cents and it wasn't horrible.","Aug 26, 2018 at 11:50 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:27:45.244994,Tobi33e,Does not Work,When started the game seems to have no internet connection and is then pretty much useless because you cant select any song.,"Sep 16, 2018 at 11:02 PM",1, 1,
