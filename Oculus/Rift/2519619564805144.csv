This is more an experience for educational purposes and would be great for kids and young people. 
The atmosphere is nice but the textures and dinosaur animations are very basic.
If you want to see Dinosaurs in VR that look MORE realistic I would say check out 'Robinson The Journey'

He enjoyed  walking around and learning about the different dinosaurs quite a bit. There are 8 different levels wich provide for a learning experience about each of the dinos in that level. There is also an open world where you can just hang out and discover new dinosours in various settings. The narration was excellent as well as decent graphics. For young dinosaur lovers it is a must have.,"Sep 30, 2020 at 1:19 AM",5, 4,
