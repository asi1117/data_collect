Also, I'd like to be able to throw breaking balls.
It's a really nice game already, and I can't wait to see what kind of features will come with updates.",Apr 22 at 12:41 PM,4, 2,

2022-05-28 19:58:42.194483,LightSkinnedJesus,Need multiplayer,"Love the game, had it since its release a few years ago. Hugeee step up with hard mode being added. But REALLY want to play against others in multiplayer. Is there a time line on when this will be implemented? Just super excited with the progress its made.",Sep 22 at 9:26 AM,5, 1,Multiplayer's ETA is mid January 2022.
2022-05-28 19:58:42.209444,EX0PIL0T,Very enjoyable experience,"Despite being in somewhat early development, the game is still very fun to play. There are personal elements, like the voice lines and (Voice-line) ads in the game that add an element of humor. The developers are very responsive too, making players feel like they have a voice.",Aug 21 at 9:36 AM,5, 0,We've come quite a ways from TOTALLY BASEBALL's initial release back in July. And we have more improvements and new features on the way!

We just checked this on our end on multiple machines testing the RIFT version and all was fine.  Have you tried updating your video card or checked if your machine needed any software updates?  If this fixes the issue, let us know by updating your review, and if not please message us on Discord (https://discord.gg/j8fpDjrWJn).

2022-05-28 19:58:45.378057,Roach,Needs to come to Quest 2 ASAP!!!,"This game is the best baseball game to ever exist on VR. I was blown away at how fantastic this game is - Reminds me a lot of Wii Sports Baseball - and I feel like it has the chance to become even greater. Unfortunately, this game can't be played on my Quest 2 natively, so I must play it with a Link cable or use my outdated Rift headset instead. Please add Quest 2 support ASAP! I don't care if it's not cross-buy, I'd happily invest in it for Quest 2. I'm really hoping development continues!

P.S. Also excited for multiplayer! But please just get that Quest 2 support down first!","Dec 27, 2020 at 4:51 PM",5, 9,It came out of EARLY ACCESS and released on the QUEST yesterday!!!
2022-05-28 19:58:45.393018,SharlLegreg,Backyard Baseball in VR,"If you loved the days of the one true GOAT Pablo Sanchez, you will love Totally Baseball.  This game brings the magic of small town league baseball to VR, and it does it almost unexpectedly.  From the outside looking in, you would think this game would be limited, yet it is extremely close to being a full on baseball experience.  

At the moment, you can only play single player, but it appears that multiplayer is coming.  I'm curious to see what it will be like to field a single position for a game, or maybe fielding multiple positions at once.  Although, the single player game currently blends pitching and fielding quite well and you get the best of both.  Throwing in general can take some time to master, but it does get easier with practice.  There are many assits to help with this and while I may not use them, it will make the game more enjoyable for those who just want to have fun.

Batting is unbelievably satisfying once you get the hang of it.  It took me some time to realize where I needed to stand in order to get a good hit.  I really enjoy seeing the swing path so I can see what I need to improve.  At first I thought it was inaccurate, but if you really analyze your swing, it's quite useful.

Given everything, Totally Baseball is the most complete baseball experience in VR at the moment.  It's in early access, so while features may be missing and bugs may exist, this game deserves the attention of every baseball fan out there.

UPDATE: I initially gave a 4 star review because the only feature missing for me was running the bases after a home run.  As of 11/26/2020, the game has been updated to provide a setting for rounding the bases!  So because they updated their game, I'm updating my review.  As previously stated, this game is in early access so bugs still exist and features are missing still, but this game is a 5 star baseball experience for where it currently stands.","Nov 26, 2020 at 9:43 PM",5, 3,<3
2022-05-28 19:58:45.408975,Sportsman1188,When is the new staduim coming out?,I just wanted to say that this game is amazing but there is one downside to it all the score board glitches out so it does not count the other teams score also sometimes if you get to close to the bench in the Announcer booth your not able to run for the rest of the game. Thanks for the help i was also wondering when the new updates are coming beacuse all the new things that should be coming out like the new team and staduim have been on coming soon for a long time now.,"Aug 9, 2020 at 11:02 PM",5, 0,"Hey there and thanks for checking out the game.  Sorry for slow response we've been on big big updates on the game like polishing up the new stadium level and fixing bugs and making things much better across the board (we're also working on a QUEST port and adding multiplayer!)  Please let us know if any of the issues you mentioned are still happening as we believe we've addressed most of those, but if not we have a big update coming in the next week that will def have those fixes applied.  Stadium is currently functional but we need to record voice over lines for our new Pro announcer character, will keep yall updated!"
2022-05-28 19:58:48.532244,Slick1984,What in the hell happened?,"UPDATE:  I can't run at all now. I can't run to the batted ball, at all. I can't run to 1st base, at all. I tried every possible button combination and with moving my arms. There was no update. I always use fresh rechargable batteries. What in the hell happened? It's too close to 14 days to keep this. I might revisit this after a few updates, but right now, no way. I don't mind supporting early access, but a step back is not what I want to pay for.

Original review was 3 stars. It's an ambious project that needs a lot of work. I do hope they get this worked out. The running was not the only issue. The pitching/throwing is too strong. There is a power slider in the options menu, it defaults to full assist. After my 1st 3 inning game, I had to lower it. I'm still gently tossing it a mile.

To the Dev(s): Work on fixing the issues before adding more content, please.

Refunded.","Apr 18, 2020 at 8:43 AM",1, 2,"Hey Slick1984 sorry if you had issues with the previous update, we've redone the character body so it stops clipping into the announcer booth which lead to loss of locomotion.  We've also added an early implementation of smooth locomotion where using one thumb stick has you run but using two at same time makes you run.  We apologize about the up and down, due to COVID-19 and our small team relocating and dealing with the day to day, our progress has been slower.  But hopefully the newest patch fixes many of the game stopping issues you were dealing with.  Please reach out to bugs@viewerready.com for a comped key."
2022-05-28 19:58:48.547204,rjschneider,👍,I love the concept of this game because it reminds me so much of Wii Sports baseball with the cartoony style graphics and gameplay. The pitching and catching mechanics are amazing and the game even has a broadcast mode that you can toggle on and off so you can watch your friends or record more interesting gameplay with camera tracking. I'm excited to see what this game has to offer in the future with a solid foundation like this,"Mar 1, 2020 at 10:47 AM",5, 9,"We've made big improvements since your early access review. If you haven't already, be sure to check it out now!"
2022-05-28 19:58:48.564158,VCRRepairman,Pretty fun experience,"This game is simple and fun. I could be wrong, but I believe this is the most full featured baseball game in VR.  All of the others are either batting cages, homerun derby, or just offer pitching and batting with no fielding or baserunning. 

I still haven't mastered batting but I love the concept of running the bases, throwing pitches, and fielding the ball.  It's close to exactly what I want in a VR baseball game.  

There is currently a big bug that triggers if you walk out of the announcer booth on the break while switching sides. The developers seem to be aware of it and will fix it. I do wish I could skip the intermission altogether. 

The only problem is there just isn't any depth.  I'd love a season or tournament mode to be implemented.  I also would love if it could detect the rotation of my controller to recognize some pitches or allow you to alter your fingers on the ball while pitching for various pitches.  Finally it would be awesome if the CPU would swing at bad pitches occasionally.

What is here is great fun.  You can catch pop flies, throw out runners, strike out batters, and hit homeruns (I haven't).  I think there is a great game in place but it just needs a bit more. It's still the best baseball VR game and great simple fun.

Edit Notes: I gave this a two star review originally but after discovering how to avoid a bug that prevents you from moving, I altered it to four stars. I trust that it will be fixed and until it is, I recommend just being stationary while in the booth during the side changes.","Mar 15, 2020 at 10:04 PM",4, 1,"Thanks again for review, the newest version now fixes the issue with locomotion."
2022-05-28 19:58:48.580115,cronicburn,must get,i got the game key from a friend on discord and its really cool to have. i rate this 5/5. good game. innin gs are nice. could you fix the not being able to walk when you try to go out of the announcer area though?,"Mar 8, 2020 at 2:54 AM",5, 3,Share this suggestion with the dev team directly on our Discord server discord.gg/totallybaseball
2022-05-28 19:58:48.595075,Piason69,FRIGGIN AWSOME!!!!!!!!!,"I've been waiting for this and its awsome, I love pitching and batting. I can tell its only the beginning to this game and its worth 5 times more then whats asked  for the purchase Price, Buy it and have 0 regrets!!","Mar 6, 2020 at 1:03 AM",5, 2,Thank you for this raving review! We love to hear people enjoy TOTALLY BASEBALL.
2022-05-28 19:58:51.673976,VP55,Fun game!,"Once you get used to the throwning, its a great game. Feels realistic.","Mar 2, 2020 at 12:32 PM",5, 2,Exactly! Once you overcome the learning curve pitching is so very rewarding! Thanks for the review.
2022-05-28 19:58:51.689933,VulcanGhost,Great Start,"I love this game, it really is alot of fun, BUT there was an issue with a fix coming in the next update that wouldn't allow you to run anymore. THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED it makes the game unplayable without starting a new game. Other than that this game is honestly  great, the hitting mechanic takes a bit getting used too, but overall I would reccommend this game if they fix the no run issue.

Needed to update my review, I went back to check again on what I thought the bug would have been and it didn't seem to happen to me again ( Other than the announcer table). Still would reccomend this game!","Mar 15, 2020 at 10:56 AM",4, 1,"The locomotion issue is now fixed, we've also added a smooth locomotion option (C) that lets you move your character around via the thumb sticks. 1 stick will have your character walk, using 2 sticks will have them run."
