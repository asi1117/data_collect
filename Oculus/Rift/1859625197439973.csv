2022-05-28 15:14:23.850659,AiriannaWW,For Science,"The narative was very well thought out and executed. The added bonus of being able to play was a great touch, I didn't focus too heavily on me being confined to a chair during my viewing, because it warns you when you get it, that it's designed for moving around. I would like to request the ability to play with the next ones where movement could be controlled through the dual joysticks of the Oculus Quest 2, as that is what I use personaly.
Side Note: Others in my situation, for Chapter 3, press down on both analog sticks while looking somewhat away from the ""point"" to change it's location, getting it closer to you, so you can reach it to touch it, and it continues. All others will continue like clock work, Chapter 2 requires your voice near the end, so as read in another review before purchased, be sure to have a mic, that my Oculus Quest 2 has one built in, and auto uses for Oculus games.",Apr 27 at 10:52 PM,4, 1,

The devs did put a lot of work into this visualisation of some results of astronomical research. This experience is great and sure worth the 10€.

A hint for those few, who have troubble running chapter 2 (like me): The interaction in this part is also acoustical, so you need to activate the mic of your Rift (and make sure, Windows allows apps to access it) or the app stops at a certain point, searching endless for a mic. ;-)","May 20, 2021 at 12:24 AM",5, 14,

The interactive stuff is short & sweet and adds a little variety to to a solid 30-40 minute 3 act experience. Unlike other tours of our Universe in VR (all of which are pretty good), this one is a bit different. You can tell the time, effort and money was there - without spoilers in each act there were definite portions that gave me emotional shivers.

It combines story-telling with AV wizardry with an artistic sensibility while retaining contact with the science. Its not an education piece, its an experiential piece, and it really showcases how VR with 3D audio can offer experiences that are simply beyond conventional media.

Revisit for this maybe a few times but for each new person you introduce to VR this should really be the one to load. Visually and interactive on all 3 chapters as little as it was still got me from sitting in my chair to standing up and interacting with the story. I play Elite Dangerous and it is amazing in a game form, but this took it to a whole new level for planets with animation, and yes Jupiter is a moving texture not just a still photo which was amazing to see. When you get a chance on the last chapter poke your head into earth you will be suppressed what you see, wait poke your head into all the planets believe me you won’t be disappointed.

Simply put, there is no better way to experience the peculiars of the Universe than here. Both the narration and effects are superb and truly has you standing in awe as you navigate through the Solar System and listen to what it tells us.

2022-05-28 15:14:46.014379,IrishGael,DON'T LET ME LEAVE MURPH!!!,"Let me start by saying that Jessica Chastain here, is an absolute boon for this VR experience. Her voice triggers my inner fanboy of the universe, ever since watching Interstellar. What a woman.
But with that aside, I find the entire experience too short(about 30 mins after subtracting the time you take wacthing the credits roll after every single chapter) and not enough WOW factor, that alot of other Space experiences give in VR.
Such as 'Appollo 11', 'Discovering Space 2' and the glorious 'Titans of Space 2'.

The most exciting chapter is the 2nd which is voiced by the beautiful Jessica Chastain, but the presentation is kinda dissappointing.
The black hole is not even slightly intimidating. Not to mention it looks like it was ripped straight out of mass Effect Andromeda. Like it looks exactly the SAME.
WTH? such a missed oppurtunity here, you could have made it look like the BH from Interstellar. Would have been amazing having Murph voice over this chapter with such a monster.

All in all it's a good educational tool. Not great, just good. If you're a fan of the universe and keep up to date with the latest tech and space news, you most likely wont learn anything.

Just can't recomend spending $15aud on a product that should be a free demo or $5 at most.","Nov 16, 2018 at 9:42 PM",2, 13,

2022-05-28 15:14:49.159966,Vetkin,Not worth $10,"I purchased this with the intent of showing it to my family over the holidays and after viewing it myself I'm honestly not sure I'm even going to leave it installed.  By the end of the second episode I was already bored and had to force myself to finish the last one. I'm giving it two stars because it was well put together, but I've seen short experiences that were as good or better than this for free. 

Outside of a few short interesting moments, like coasting along the rings of saturn, or watching a star's light warp as it passes behind a black hole, I felt like most of the visuals were not all that impressive.  It was more artistic expression than realism, and it doesn't invoke any sense of presence when presented with these celestial objects.  Most of them, aside from a few close up fly-bys of Jupiter and Saturn, feel like diarama models.

The science presented isn't all that in depth either.  Granted I've spent many hours watching documentaries on the subjects touched on here but this felt like a science exhibit for children. It was probably intended to be more artistic than educational, so don't purchase expecting to learn a whole lot. 

The narration was well done and the presentation was good, so it's clear some work was put into this. It's worth a watch, just not for the price they're asking in my opinion. All of the glowing reviews persuaded me to gamble $10 on this experience and I already wish I'd spent it elsewhere.","Nov 18, 2018 at 9:21 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 15:14:49.174926,Kevin_Brook,"All style, wanted more substance","As other reviews have said this is a sonic and visual feast, and a tremendous piece of dreamlike art. It really is a unique experience and definitely worth checking out. It's very short however, and unlike the excellent Hold the World released last week by Sky, I didn't feel like I learnt a whole lot. In fact I ended up more confused than anything. Do the planets and stars actually sound the way they portray in this? Does the magnetosphere look like that when 'viewed' through the appropriate electromagnetic frequency? I have no idea. When they lined up the planets of our solar system the scale was totally off, with Jupiter being virtually the same size as the sun and Uranaus and Neptune being bigger than Saturn so artistic license obviously take precedent over education here. Therefore if the sights and sounds experienced aren't an accurate depiction of reality it becomes more of a  virtual reality surrealist art piece than an educational tour of the cosmos. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but for me if I'm told something I want to know if its true or not and with this I have no idea what is a accurate and what is artistic fantasy so I left feeling intrigued but confused and perplexed. Maybe that was the idea... For £7.99 its a very short piece. I much preferred Hold the World and that was £3.99. It's worth checking out for sure but if you want to hold on for the inevitable sale price you'll probably value it more.  If you're just going in for this for the experience however, and aren't bothered how much of it is 'true', then it's a fantastic picture of our universe.","Nov 16, 2018 at 3:38 AM",4, 16,

There is some basic interaction throughout which is well thought out and engaging.  Be warned that the experience calls for a large play area and means it,  notably in the first Chapter.  I don't have a large play area and had to do the move/Reset View walk to make my way over to some far away planets.  That was the only slight glitch though, other than that it was all very smooth, incredible production values, and an intersting angle at an interesting subject.

2022-05-28 15:14:58.668534,Raunhofer,Pretty space experience,"Spheres has 3 chapters which are each about +10 mins long. Each chapter has some pretty rudimentary interactions where you wave your hands or touch various objects while someone narrates what's happening.

Graphically the experience is pretty. It's not stunning, but it is well composed. The experience does suffer of the current Rift (CV1) limitations, as the dark parts of the experiences look pretty awful.

I am disappointed that the Spheres doesn't really teach you anything. Everything it shows to you is so artistic or abstract that it loses all the real world meaning. Apparently planets and other bodies make sounds, ok, but as the experience was so overblown I have no idea were those sounds real examples or something else. The experience also displays distances in space very poorly. I didn't feel like I was in space.

Oh, and one more thing: this is not a comfortable experience! I have no idea why are they calling it that, but is not! It's moderate at least.","Nov 18, 2018 at 6:26 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 15:15:01.774227,jdukeOculus,The visuals of space are meant for VR,"Each story had great artistic recreations for a rather wide variety of space objects. Many were fun to look at and created solid sense of wonderment even for someone who watches all the great space documentaries. In time there will be so much better renditions of our universe for VR. This is an excellent start. 

4 Stars because I saw the credits way more often than I prefered (eyes and face get tired in vr and this time just adds to it with no return)","Nov 16, 2018 at 12:12 PM",4, 4,

2022-05-28 15:15:01.807139,ccdeltabeta,A Mix of Discovering Space 2 & the BLU,"As 'the BLU' took you on an undersea tour of  the ocean, so 'Spheres' takes you on a tour through certain aspects of the cosmos. The limited (though fun) interactivity you have during your tour of space does wonders in letting you feel what it could be like to be part of such a universe.
For those hoping to jump in a ship and Jean Luc-Picard yourself around the universe will be disappointed (e.g., Discovering Space 2), but can take comfort in that the quality of the trip is enhanced by being on a guided tour.
For each of the 3 acts (all nicely narrated), there will be moments where you can almost start to feel swallowed up by the enormity of the universe we reside in, which to me is this strength of this experience.  The downside, such as it is, is that you so desperately want to get off this guided tour and explore on your own.
This experience, from a sci-fi geek perspective, begins to answer my question of what would it be like to fly through V'ger (Star Trek: The Motion Picture) or what Astronaut Dave Bowman experienced in 2001: A Space Odyssey.
The length of the experience is about 30 minutes overall.  One could argue this experience could have been broken up into 3 seperate $3.33 experiences to give you a taste, and the choice, to continue on the exploration of the galaxy.
If there is disappointment with this experience, it is that there is so much left to see, and so much you want to do on your own.
Having an experience like this present at a Space Museum would likely get me to stop and read more of the placards in front of all the exhibits, because I will have already seen all that I could hope for.  An experience like this has wonderful educational potential, and possibly represents where the focus in VR should be aimed at, rather than solely on games.","Nov 15, 2018 at 4:44 PM",4, 2,

There are few, if any, VR experiences I have seen that rival Spheres in terms of production quality and cohesiveness. The experience plays out over three different episodes, each with their own narrator and unique feel, but there is a narrative thread that manages to connect them all to one another. The pacing feels appropriate, feeling neither too rushed nor too slow and boring, with minor interactive elements that allow users to proceed at their own pace. The experience has a decent amount of replayability but where it really shines will be in showing it off to your friends. Spheres is a must-have in any serious VR fan’s collection!","Nov 15, 2018 at 12:09 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:15:14.477252,metheniel,No real takeaway,"This is not a documentary - more like a Hollywood movie? I have nothing against blockbusters but the fact that this is advertised more or less as an educational experience makes it seem a bit dishonest to me. It is really difficult to discern fact from fiction in the way the story is told. 

I would not use this to teach anything to my children. There is better out there if you want to actually learn about space with VR. “Overview walk through the universe” is a documentary at the BBC/IMAX-level, and it really really makes you feel how tiny we are in the cosmos. “Apollo 11” is also great. “Exoplanet Excursions”. Anything but this...

It reminded me of when I was a kid and went to the planetarium for school… but even more interesting!
