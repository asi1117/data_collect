2022-05-28 20:40:49.329130,TheForbinProject,After 1.5 years I highly recommend,"Update: After 1.5 years, I still use this program frequently. It is still being updated and the experience is even better.  

Original Review:  I had seen a lot of positive reviews (along with a handful of some more critical) regarding this app and honestly, I was afraid of astro-turfing.  I watched a demo that Ice Poseidon did with the developers on Mixer and that looked interesting enough to try it out (with the thought of refunding if unhappy).  I already have a subscription to Tripp for meditation, and I also use the free app Cosmic Flow on my Quest.  I have also used the VR app ""Ayahuasca.""  I enjoy each.  This app is a lot different from Tripp insofar as the meditative aspects are more self-guided.  What makes this app truly unique is that it responds directly to your input (i.e. voice); it involves you directly whereas other experiences are more (or completely) detatched).  The psychedlic feedback (which is directly tied to your voice) is surprisingly spot-on.  If you have done LSD, this app somehow does mimic (not perfectly replicate) the shifted perspective (for lack of a better phrase) you might get from your sensory perception intertwining--in this case, the sound from your voice has an immediate, psychedlic impact on the visuals you see.  It is quite effective for basically blissing out and finding yourself ""present"" yet detatched.  

There is some minor audio crackling intermittently that may or may not be able to be patched out--I suppose it depends on if that is generated by the mic you're using or the program.  I did have one weird glitch during an experience where the screen froze for about 1 sec.  

This is not a game and it has a pretty steep price at launch.  That said, if you are really interested in meditation or using VR for calming purposes, I recommend it.  I've been in VR since 2016 and have tried a lot of odd programs--this is one of the most unique and definitely suggests that the technology can be leveraged for therapeutic purposes.",Aug 27 at 8:38 AM,5, 9,
2022-05-28 20:40:49.344090,Buzzzelgum,I cried the first time I used this...,"This may seem like an odd review but I felt compelled to write about my experience. I am a vocalist and I have experiemented with magic mushrooms in the past, to alliviate symptoms of depression and emptiness. I wanted a VR meditation experience, and when I saw the trailer mentions Terrence Mckenna I was sold! 
Being a vocalist I am very connected to using my voice as a way to express emotions. This app is absolutely incredible. I put the headset on for my morning meditation and figured I would give this one a try. MINDBLOWN is the only way to describe. I followed the instructions and began allowing sound to flow. Whatever notes/colours I wanted to paint my landscape. I feel totally free in this space. It's a wonderfully creative space, where the visuals and sounds you hear, compliment the sound you are making. It reminds me of C.S Lewis as he describes Aslan (in the Narnia BOOKS), creating the universe with his song. Roots sprouting from the earth inspired by his tune. 

If you are muscial at all, or want to connect with the deeper primal feelings we all push down in everyday life, then I highly suggest giving this a go! It's wonderful and I want to thank the developers for making something like this possible!","Sep 28, 2020 at 6:48 PM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 20:40:49.359050,Lighthouse2020,Very disturbing,"It completely distorts the sounds I am making, turning them into the spawn of evil. The images are very annoying too, way too much flashing and makes my adrenalin go up. I feel like I just want to escape from a hellish nightmare. How do I get my money back? This is dangerous to the brain and the mind.","Oct 11, 2020 at 2:29 AM",1, 1,"did you get your refund via Oculus or do you still need help with this?  if so, email me directly at hello@enterandromeda.com and we'll get you taken care of."

2022-05-28 20:40:49.388970,Astaraten,Lacking somewhat visually,"Although I think overall its a good purchase and including your own tones throughout the game is great.  I dont like the repetitive introduction. And its lacking visually. I would like to see more vibrant colors. And dmt tunnels would be awesome. Throw in some machine elves and maybe some aliens or light beings that communicate with you. This would be amazing. Maybe have a separate ""story"" mode and a meditation mode. Idk I just think there's a lot of potential with this app. And developers could definitely improve.","Apr 26, 2020 at 1:39 PM",4, 23,"Hi, thanks for this feedback. We're working on a custom engine for this, and there's limitations to what we can make it do in real time, using your vocal input, but we do hope to keep developing for a future version built on a more broadly applicable engine. Since this review, the color pallets have been made MUCH more saturated. I like the idea, in general, of having entities or something, but this isn't that kind of game. We don't want you looking for adventure or intrigue while meditating, it kind of hobbles the meditation itself. There are lots of games with cool stories and trippy visuals, but there are no others that hack your brain into the meditative state. We need to maintain that feature as it's the only thing that holds this apart from the rest. We hope you understand and continue to experiment with SoundSelf.

2022-05-28 20:40:52.508626,SeventhRay,This game changed my life!!,"I have played other meditation titles and “wellness experiences” but none of them has been as enjoyable, unique, and taken me deep into a trance/ peaceful state like Soundself. I would recommend this to anyone! People that have never meditated, this is short cut to bliss, people that have meditated, you have never been taken to a state like this before in your practice. Digital Psychadelic is an understatement.","May 2, 2020 at 7:27 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 20:40:52.524583,Beatnik68,,Really like the app but as someone who meditates daily would love to see the option to skip the intro as many meditaters already use their own technique to start ones meditation session. Occasionally low resolutions would pop up but all in all a great app that will improve over time as the developer is always listening to comments and implementing them when possible. hats off to developer making an original app that adds positivity to the gaming world and indeed to meditation practice.,"Apr 24, 2020 at 8:06 PM",5, 9,"Sorry for the long delay in response here, I was unaware of Oculus feedback! Since your review was posted, we have added the option to turn off the guide in the beginning so you can jump right into the meditation. We're constantly working towards improving performance, although it can be slow going with our small team. We hope you'll keep playing and that you enjoy the updates.

2022-05-28 20:40:52.540540,Buttery_Potato,Better than a floatation center!,"To be fair, I don't have a regular Floatation practice but this was as, if not more, relaxing and a lot less salty. Wishing this had been out a couple of days ago when I dropped but as EnterAndromeda says, a little indica really lifts the dish. The only criticism I have is the lack of video/sound settings in experience and the lack of an explaination for what checking and unchecking the two options on either side of the start button does.
Small gripes aside, amazing work, nail on the head.","Apr 23, 2020 at 5:23 AM",5, 5,"Hi! thanks for the review. I hope you'll check out the latest updates and see if the sound/video settings you wanted are there.

2022-05-28 20:40:52.555500,interventionist,The best psychedelic experience in VR,"My first review.  Have a couple hundred games but most of the games have their own reviews so I don’t usually bother.  But the reason I’m posting one on this is because it’s awesome now and has a lot of potential.  I use technology in a lot of my spiritual practices (muse headband, etc) and most of the meditation apps are just meh.  This one does a great job of creating a visual experience, Breathwork and feedback.  I hope the developer expands on this, perhaps adding the ability to play our own music, or adding other visualizers.  And, I guess I should also mention that for those who use plant medicine this pretty cool.  As a side note, directly to the developer, I think you should reach out to Alex Grey and collaborate.","Apr 27, 2020 at 7:58 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 20:40:55.655210,bubblerobot,calming,"combined with good breathing (breath in through the nose and breath out through the mouth, by breathing out you can do noises (chant or humm) which influences the visual experience. breathing has a strong effect on your body and mind and combining exhaling with noise is said to have a healing effect (there is no general evidence for that but it feels definitely great and worth exploring). the VR itself enforces a stronger focus on yourself by shutting out the world. for my personal taste it feels a bit dark and monotonous, i would prefer more calming patterns, more colors and or a journey/travel but that is me... in any case, good for those who love to combine VR and Meditation.","Apr 27, 2020 at 7:37 PM",4, 1,"Hi! thank you for the feedback, this is wonderful. We suggest looking into vagus nerve functioning, if you're looking for evidence that toning can help with health. There's certainly a lot of evidence for this, and we hope to get more and more people vocalizing in this way to gather more first hand experience with the benefits. I understand wanting the vibe to be adjustable, that's a thing many people have talked about. One of the devs is working on modding tools so players can adjust many things about the experience.
