2022-05-28 18:39:59.144786,rh_galaxy,A well done game,"A 2D game where VR doesn't add much, but there are a lot of levels and you get ranked. Ranking is mostly based on time and not on completion, and the limits seems somewhat hard, but it is possible to get gold after a while. The game is in a polished complete state.","Jan 6, 2019 at 2:43 AM",3, 1,

I've played this game years ago, before VR version was released. The game is from the PS3 era (albeit with somewhat revamped visuals), the VR doesn't add much, but for a low price, I can hardly complain. You get what you pay for.","Aug 19, 2018 at 4:34 PM",3, 1,
