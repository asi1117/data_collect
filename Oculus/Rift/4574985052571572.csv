2022-05-28 20:03:06.374597,TigerGandhi,Cool Ego-Adventure-Shooter!,"Exciting tour through numerous little scenarios. Very cool graphic design! Yes, using both hands for the weapons makes it more difficult, but gives you much more immersion. Outstanding job, letting the gun smoke from the muzzle clutter your own visibility. Not only once I had the feeling to be amidst a ""Band of Brothers"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" scene. I love it when the M1 Garand mag clip ""pings"" out! Best deal in the last months!",Dec 14 at 5:05 AM,5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:03:06.388559,ScOoTeR32K,Great Game :),Really enjoying this so far :) just needs to have the gun mechanics tweaked a bit and maybe show the left hand on the gun stock while gripping to add a little more immersion. This title would do really well I think if they can develop it in a quest 2 version as well,"Apr 5, 2021 at 10:01 PM",4, 14,

2022-05-28 20:03:06.418479,The_Grim_Fandango,Worth it,Great game. Needs some bug fixes but other than that runs solid. Would also love to see it on Quest/Quest 2!,"May 15, 2021 at 4:22 AM",5, 2,
