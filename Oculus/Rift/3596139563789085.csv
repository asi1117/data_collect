2022-05-28 20:13:41.224146,VCRRepairman,Awesome nostalgia trip,"I love almost every game this studio releases. This game is no exception. If you played the ""shmups"" from the eighty's and ninety's, you'll be right at home. This is more though thanks a spiritual successor to 1942, it has immersive zones much like their other game ""Operation Warfare"" where you are transported into the plane cockpit or directly behind it. It really is something special.

My only complaint comes from the fact this game is not crossbuy with the Quest version. I've brought it up on Reddit and the developer states that it isn't possible. I don't know if it's possible to do some kind of prove you have the Rift version or something and they send a key but that would have been awesome. That kind of prevents me from buying any more of their games on the Rift store as that is the big perk to me over Steam. You can't blame them though, it's an Oculus problem.",Jul 2 at 10:15 PM,5, 2,

2022-05-28 20:13:41.254066,LeeFarley,Nostalgia Overload,"Wow!  I'm not one for leaving reviews but this game left me both speechless and with a large grin on my face.  For anyone familiar with the 19XX arcade games this is a must-buy.  It truly takes your memories and smacks you about the face with them.  Graphically stunning, mechanically varied and plenty of replayability in terms of scores and achievements.  I sincerely hope this game does well because if the development team can create this type of experience and apply them to other arcade games I would buy them up in a second.  I have two small criticisms (1) the scientist guy talking between levels - although they are skippable they simply did not grab my attention and my preference would be that they might have been shorter or have the ability to turn them off and (2) cockpit Immersion Zones can be a little janky control-wise compared to the smoothness of the other styles of gameplay and I would like movement to be ever so slightly less jerky when changing direction.  But other than that I just want more - I'd like more DLC for this - more terrain - more variety.  I used the Xbox 360 controller whilst playing and had zero issues.  I wish the developers of this game every success.","Mar 14, 2021 at 5:20 PM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 20:13:41.284985,theregoes2,Another Beautiful Arcarde to VR Game,"I've only just started playing but I played the crap out of Operation Warcade and I loved the way it took one of my favourite oldschool arcade games, Operation Wolf, and brought it to VR while still retaining what made the arcade game special. And this looks like it's done the same things with 1943. It's brilliant and if you enjoy this one check out Operation Warcade as well.","Jan 31, 2021 at 11:17 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 20:13:44.423696,Enoch72,Great fun (except the ‘Immersion Zones’),"Firstly the positives.....This is great fun and an amazing sense of 3D playing a classic game I remember from my youth (I’m in my late 40’s).

I can’t help playing with a big grin on my face.

However, the main negative is the ‘Immersion Zones’, where you’re either in the cockpit or positioned directly behind your plane in full VR. 

Whilst this looks super cool, that sense of awe is soon replaced with frustration as it becomes apparent the controls are terrible in these sections.....Not intuitive AT ALL. The complete opposite of what it should be for flying games. It’s so bad that I’m purposely avoiding the ‘Immersion Zones’ because they are so unplayable and frustrating.

This is a great shame because the controls in the normal 3D sections are spot on and is great fun as a result.

If the developers fix the ‘Immersion Zone’ sections with better controls then I would give this game 5 Stars in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, it falls short because of this so I can only give it 4 stars........This game falls into the “almost perfect” category.","Jan 29, 2021 at 10:24 PM",4, 7,"Thanks for your feedback. When the game starts you can select the first option and you will use your stick in all the games, including immersion zones. Can you try this? The default option (named mixed) uses the virtual hand in the immersion zones and this works ok, but you must be seated and with your elbow supported in the chair to play ok."
2022-05-28 20:13:44.437661,ChenChen40,"Really Really good, almost great",This game is a lot of fun.  For NES players from the 90's this is a great blend of nostalgic game play blended with modern tech.  Please fix the immersion zone issue with the bomber plane turrent controls being broken and this is a 5 star game.,"Feb 4, 2021 at 4:20 AM",4, 1,"What's the problem with the controls in the turrets immersion zone?
