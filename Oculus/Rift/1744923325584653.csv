I am not usually super-sensitive to VR nausea, but I couldn't really enjoy what was going on because of the feeling and dread for each upcoming motion-filled scene.

Also, I didn't understand what happened or why.

Not for me, I guess, but I appreciate that it had a really neat environment, a fun, friendly secondary character doing things in the background, and that it was free.","Aug 2, 2019 at 9:17 AM",3, 2,

I loved it and the immersion was pefectly done, largely helped with little things companies just don't usually do for some reason, like camera shaking when you're running etc. (other companies take note! Your vision is not still when running!!).

I have waited so long for something to make me actually feel like I was flying and the experience prior where you're being chased on the ground was just as amazing. More please!","Jan 16, 2019 at 6:47 AM",5, 2,

For everyone saying this is ""too dark"", let me share a secret with you; we need darkness to appreciate the light. We need to know pain to know what pleasure is. We need to have our hearts broken to truly appreciate love, and we need to remember that death awaits us all, in order to quit taking the beauty of life for granted, as we're so apt to do.  This is a beautiful story, in part BECAUSE of the darkness in it.  Those of you who have had to walk some very dark, lonely paths will know exactly what I mean. For the rest-I don't know; try reading Man's Search for Meaning or something. Learn to see the beauty in ALL of life's experiences.","Dec 31, 2018 at 7:22 AM",5, 1,

The people complaining about the ending not being for kids (disagree, it isnt THAT dark) well not every experience is built for every person...thats like saying PG 13 movies are bad for not being for 5 yr olds. 

 To those saying ""I can't interact! I don't understand this game demo!! D:"" It clearly states in the description, it isn't a game...it literally says ""non-game"" If only I could see a full length movie like this! A follow up game would be amazing as well lol, but, im happy with either!

 This is a MASTERPIECE! Although short, im excited to experience this many more times! This is also going into the ""show off VR"" to new people queue !

(My favorite is the flying bat)
I Love The Graphics
I love the animation
I love the depth
------------------
What I don't like is the STORY!!
Normally when you create something rather it being a cartoon, animation ect 
it always follows a story that way the audience can feel and create this bond (no pun intended) with the movie.
Another thing that kinda cought me off guard is the ending 
I won't spoil anything but i think the ending is alittle dark don't you think?
I want my family and my little sister and my cousins to watch this but i can't really do that when the ending is this dark...

I really hope you guys make more because the animation is amazing!!!","Oct 30, 2018 at 7:43 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 19:31:52.118587,Fluke,I want to explore this world,"This is a beautifully made short story, and absolutely worth your time.

It's a solid 4 stars really, but can have a 5th as the visuals showed me a world that I want to explore, and to top it off they didn't try and charge for such short experience (unlike some others).

I hope they develop this world into something else, whether a full length story or a even a game - I'd pay for either.","Oct 31, 2018 at 8:16 AM",5, 8,

Also, it is very short.  Neither of these things are bad though and this is probably my favorite of all the animated shorts that have been made to date.  The world it takes place in is breathtaking and I'll be using this as a VR introduction tool for new people.  I do hope these devs do more stuff in the future if not a game based on this world.

This is not for hard core gamers who like shooting, violence, and lots of action. This is a trip into a psychedelic, metaphysical fantasy world that makes a statement against violence.

On the minus side, there is a non-harmonious combination of solemn ritual and fast action (and murder).

At times control of the view is completely taken away from the user's head movement. During one of the chase scenes the viewpoint is shaken up and down as the creature gallops. I have my VR legs for Onward etc but that bit made me really dizzy. There's no freaking way you should share this with anyone unless you're happy with the possibility of them feeling terrible afterwards.","Oct 31, 2018 at 11:47 PM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 19:31:58.395005,Blahde,Can't be watching the same thing.....,"Oh...er.
Well, judjing by the reviews already posted I really did expect more. I mean, we all know free stuff has a limit, no problem with that at all.

The thing is, it was over very quickly (fair do's, IT COSTS NOTHING!) and I presume there will be much more to come?
On the basis of this **non-Interactive** demo I'd give it 1* only. It works of course, but it only shows a few cartoon characters that I can't interact with. I can't move, I can only look around, at poor GFX...GFX are NOT everything of course, just sometimes you gotta stop looking like ""Giants: Citizen of Kabuto"" circa.....1982??? You get my point, I ...hope..
So, not for me then! ....Obviously ;-) Free is OK, go for it if you want!.

2022-05-28 19:31:58.424434,jmalmsten,Three little vignettes with a bookend,"I guess if simplistic storybooks are your thing then maybe it's a great ride? But I was left kind of cold. 

It was interesting to see the POV-shots of animals and creatures (although you need serious VR-legs to stomach some of it). But in earnest. its biggest flaw is that it doesn't stray away from the well trodden norms of what oculus insists on promoting as ""experiences"". It's not an ""experience"" it's a tech demo. 

And after seeing dozens of them we want more, at least I want more. I want more than the predictable storybook scenarios where we wait for characters to finish their animation so the next bit of immersion can start. I want characters that actually feel like individuals and not puppets flung around. I want my stories to challange what I thought was possible with visual storytelling. 

""experiences"" like these are just preaching to the choir. A choir ever dwindling as they get bored with being fed with the same narratives over and over.","Nov 7, 2018 at 12:42 AM",2, 1,

O.k. Mild violence probably covers poke someone with spear throught your own eyes. I wouldnt let it to see it my children. They can accept in several ways. Enjoy it or have trauma, or take it as normal... all three possibilities seems to me be really bad. Such mild violence in RL cant imagine. But lot of schoolars are mild violent then.
