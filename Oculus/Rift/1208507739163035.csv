2022-05-28 15:39:17.211454,Angelina Starr,Meh.,"2-1/2 stars.  I could have spent $3 on worse things like renting Terminator 5 on Amazon again I guess, but I'm having trouble saying this is even good for a once-though.  Short and not particularly interesting to me.  Google Earth which is free, has far more interesting places to explore like Horseshoe Bend and Hoover Dam among many and the images are real, not created.","Oct 25, 2020 at 1:58 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 15:39:17.239379,OctopusGarden,Short but very impressive,I can say that they really give you the feel that you're in the Grand Canyon.   It is kind of antimated but still colorful and an enjoyable experience.   I definitely think this is one of the coolest experience in VR that I have encountered.   Definite something that you might comeback to on occasions to experience over and over.,"Jun 29, 2020 at 2:06 PM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 15:39:17.255337,TerryTiger,Fabulous Experience!,"This $3.00 app does exactly what it says - it's a trip down the river in the Canyon.  The scenery is well done, superb, I would say.  A night time and a day time trip is included and both are very enjoyable.  This is not a game, although some interaction is available.  It's very relaxing and peaceful.  Kudos to the developers.  I hope you do more like this!  ... played on a Rift S, 2080ti ...  worked flawlessly!","Jul 31, 2019 at 12:56 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:39:17.268302,michael.lubuguin,Simple VR boat ride but relaxing,"Overall, it's a nice simple VR boat ride around a small area of the Grand Canyon with a couple of nice vantage point stops and a few animals to encounter along the way. I would have liked to see a few more animals and wished that I could lure that rabbit towards me by offering it some food (like you can with the fish), but it's still a nice little VR experience with decent graphics and is good for relaxation or if you just want to chill out with some peaceful scenery.","Jul 22, 2019 at 11:15 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 15:39:17.283262,nightcat.mau,Cool Ride,"I’m not sure how earlier reviewers played this experience, but it took me a good hour to get through. There is a day trip and a night trip and I started with the night trip first. Plenty to do including two lookout points (I missed the first one), listen to the coyotes sing, and admire the full moon. There is also a friendly rabbit that may like to share your fire, and of course, the waterfall!
Day trip is in the opposite direction with butterflies, fish to feed, hawks and other flora and fauna. I understand from previous reviews it was free at one point, but for the price of $2.99 you get a lot of value. Stopping to admire the full moon or other beauty spots is relaxing so is feeding the fish.  
It is a set track you go on and you could get through it much faster than I did if you open the throttle all the way. So milage will vary, but it is a relaxing experience and it’s nice that the flashlight from the night trip returns to the boat faithfully even if you try to lob it into the water to see what happens.","Aug 2, 2018 at 2:44 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 15:39:20.397931,I-M_BlackShaddow,Not as fast as in my F15 or AH64,"Nice, Pritty, restful, will use multi times for me, and to demo to family and friends.","Aug 24, 2018 at 1:24 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 15:39:20.412891,Blackrat,,"I was expecting more than a minimal experience. This just doesn't come up to scratch. Not worth messing about with, try something else.","Apr 9, 2018 at 1:03 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 15:39:20.426854,VirtuaLieven,"Could be better, but it's nice","Those who wish more functions in this are right; The app could need some improvement in the reactions; But it does exactly what it's promising: a boat trip through the Grand Canyon. Of course it would be fun if you could touch things, but for what?
This is a wonderful ""goes nowhere, does nothing"" VR app, but one should not expect too much action from it. I liked it. PS: It's fun to step outside the boat and watch like swimming in the water; unfortunately, when being under the water, it doesn't look like being under the water.","Jan 17, 2018 at 12:23 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 15:39:20.441814,becklarae,Beautiful Scenery,"This is so relaxing, if you ring the bell on the right it's nightime and there is a flashlight to look all around. If you ring the bell on the left its daytime. Not for sure how to feed the fish. The only drawback is when you ring the bells all the way it starts over. But for free, its worth it.","Jan 8, 2018 at 5:09 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:39:20.455776,RuneSR2,Nice - but this experience feels dated,"Two years ago this would have been far more impressive, unfortunately there are many better experiences in VR today. This is basically a 15 minutes 360 degrees video, where you can stop or control the speed. Apart from a flashlight and ringing a few bells there's little to no interaction. Paid $2 for this tech demo, I do not think it's worth more today. Runs perfect using supersampling 2.0 on GTX 1080.","Dec 23, 2017 at 7:56 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 15:39:23.556483,rh_galaxy,What is wrong with you who gives one *?,"A relaxing boat ride set in day or night, with beautiful graphics... even at $10 it is better/longer than many other vr titles. But it is not a game, and doesn't claim to be one.","Nov 15, 2017 at 5:18 AM",4, 4,

Once you arrive at the canyon, sitting in the chair under the tree, look behind you. You will see a paddle. Grab this and you can paddle anywhere you like!"

2022-05-28 15:39:23.616323,Catnip2,"Really enjoyable, more please","There aren't many of this kind of relaxing ride/sight seeing tour, I just wish there are more, perhaps in a luscious green forest. Let this be a start.","Nov 17, 2017 at 7:47 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 15:39:26.731990,Clickingtoenails,Great environment!,"I enjoy this along with the other - Non-Shoot-EM-up games. :) VR is for everyone, even my 80 yr old Mom!","Nov 13, 2017 at 9:09 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:39:26.746950,Aquavemo,Stressed or just love nature? Buy this!,"I read the description and expected a relaxing ride through a canyon - and thats what i got!

The experience is well made, graphics and sound are good. The scaling is impressive, the details as well. Lenght is just about right.

Definitely worth the money if you know what you are looking for.

Wished there was more interaction or a way to steer myself.","Sep 7, 2017 at 4:37 AM",4, 9,
2022-05-28 15:39:26.761910,LukeRoss,Great experience!,"Bought for €2.99 during the summer sale. Cannot say that I understand the negative reviews. The experience could not be more polished and entertaining if this were a Disney park ride, and there is the added advantage that you can repeat it however many times you like and show it to your family and friends too.
I enjoyed this a lot. I recommend that you keep the boat motor speed at minimum to have time to take in the beautiful sights, feed the fish... and don't forget to ring all the bells!
I had to redo the night ride because the first time I failed to see the flashlight :-)","Jul 17, 2017 at 6:08 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:39:26.777867,Zimberfitz,Save your money :\,"If you're looking for some meditation, maybe. if you're looking for a good experence, look elsewhere
This expereence was very underwealming. I went inot this expecting a cool little experence where you could relax and take your mind off it all, with a boat and paddles. just you and a lake. Instead you get a motor boat that's on a kiddie track in a circle. It was barley worth the 2 bux i paid for it :\. If you're looking for some meditation, maybe. if you're looking for a good experence, look elsewhere","Jun 24, 2017 at 7:44 AM",1, 1,

2022-05-28 15:39:29.914478,Gilbertsmall,Great relaxation experience.,"For the purpose of clearing your mind, escaping into a peaceful environment, this is great. The night view lets you see the stars, fireflies, and a glowing moon. The day view lets you gaze in awe at the rock formations. It is catharctic, meditative. To make this better, I would like to see a larger area to explore and more than one path.","May 28, 2017 at 4:05 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 15:39:29.945395,stargate88,nice ballade,"I was scepical at the beggining because of the bad reviews. Great balade in a canoe along the grand canyon. I enjoyed it. I bought it on sales, that's why I'm giving an extra star otherwise might be expensive if it's an experience you're the only one to benefit from.","Apr 9, 2017 at 5:52 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:39:29.959358,RPVY,Wow! What a fun experience,"I don't know what the heck people expected from this game, and why it got such low reviews, because it was super fun for me. The environment is so well designed, the sound is on points, i mean holy moly you get a feel that you're actually there. Immersion, that's what this game gives you. Sure it's not Robo Recall caliber, but it's a very respectable experience. Try the night node too, so peaceful, so beautiful","Apr 7, 2017 at 12:01 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:39:29.974317,dvdlm914,,"If you can grab it for cheap, it's ok. There's nothing in particular to do, which is unfortunate, and it doesn't seem like much has been added from the time I bought it in early access to actual release. But the graphics are fairly good if you want a relaxing on the rails experience.","Apr 1, 2017 at 4:09 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 15:39:33.071035,Maclover25,Pretty good,"The graphics look pretty good compared to some. The experince is nice. Lasts about 10 minutes (dependant on how fast you want to go). Makes me want to kayak the Grand Canyon. To me only worth about $3 or $4, not much more.","Mar 30, 2017 at 2:57 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 15:39:33.085995,Viper-6,,This was an excellent way to experience the splendor of the Grand Canyon.

2022-05-28 15:39:33.100955,krectus,Decent short experience,For those looking for more slower relaxing VR experiences this is for you.  But it's not all that long or worth going back to much.,"Mar 31, 2017 at 3:12 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 15:39:33.114918,cybernettr,Not interactive,The biggest problem with this is it's not interactive--you can't control what path you take. But the developer is still working on this and has added features like translucent water effects with fish you can see and Touch support.
