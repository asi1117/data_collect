And secondly to explore a magical land like a child lost in fantasies. Yes it is simple, but it does serve those purposes very well and the interactions with your surroundings (yes you can influence the world) are very well designed. I cannot say that I missed touch integrations. I would even go as far as to say that they would be distracting - so please don't dismiss this because it does not have touch support!

I wholeheartedly recommend this to anybody who is looking for a simple relaxing game.","May 26, 2018 at 2:08 AM",5, 2,"Thank you so much for your review. Touch controls are now fully supported in the latest version. Thanks again for the positive feedback.

But right now it's more of a relaxation game where you can listen to amazing classical music while you float around slowly and stumble around for collectables, land, and fire missiles into targets.  So it's really good as a relaxation game.  It's impossible to fail and the classical music selection is top-notch.  This game is worth it just to hear the music while in the air.  And it has some okayish exploration to it.  But it's really missing any kind of immersion you would feel if you were really flying a hot air balloon.  You don't even see the fire burning that would propel your hot air balloon.  This game needs a better sense of flight.  I think it starts with there being very few markers to indicate to you that you're moving fast.  I understand low textures, and how that makes the game run fast and might give the game an artistic look.  But this game really needs more textures to help in feeling immersed in flight.  The sky just doesn't look like a sky at all.  Unless you're intentionally falling fast, you never get a sense of speed.  You never feel like you're really up in the air.  And the lack of motion controllers really adds to that problem.  We need motion controls to steer the balloon.  Press down a rope to make it climb, another to fall.  pull to make it go left or right.  I do recommend the game.  But it's more of a chill and listen to classical music experience now than anything else and see some okayish visuals.  The current gameplay elements or discovery elements just aren't good enough.","Dec 17, 2017 at 4:17 AM",3, 2,Touch controls are now fully supported.

There's more on offer here than first meets the eye, and while there are some clues, the game won't hold your hand and tell you how everything works. Pay careful attention to your balloon, the landscape and the collectables, and it'll reward you with mystereous new areas and features for your balloon. Controls are simple for anyone to understand (look down for hints), but still require skill. For my taste, I'd like to be able to rise/fall a little faster, but I understand how that might make some folks motion sick. Keep an eye on your climb/drop meter and you'll understand the controls faster. I was genuinely surprised how much I liked this, and how compelling it felt to keep hunting down those elusive collectables.","Jul 16, 2017 at 6:40 AM",5, 6,
