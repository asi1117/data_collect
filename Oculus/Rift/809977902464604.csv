I could spend hours playing this game. There is plenty to unlock and it is really a blast. You really feel like you are flying. I wish they had more aircraft and will probably make you sick the first few times playing it, it is the only VR game that has done so.","Jul 12, 2020 at 9:18 AM",5, 5,

World is not ""realistic"" looking; looks like a computer game from the 2000's, but the flight controls are real and the missions are entertaining.  It does take a while to progress, however.  Been playing a few hours and still haven't gotten past the first aircraft.  Still, for the money, great VR app.","Jan 3, 2020 at 4:07 AM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 14:29:22.000690,oysterassassin,"Good, but.....","I gave this two stars. With only a little work it could be four stars. I play it a lot. In the beginning, the nausea factor was extreme. Now, months later, the nausea factor is minimal. I have concluded that the more time you spend in VR, the less the nausea factor, especially if you never try to ""push through"" the nausea, but STOP when it first starts. Anyway, I am a fixed wing and rotary wing pilot. I owned a helicopter logging operation for years. I also have over 600 hours in ultralights. My first complaint about the game is the scenery. It's too simplistic. Yes, better scenery requires a lot of resources, but most games have better graphics than this and can run well on the Quest. There's no excuse for crappy graphics on the Rift. Much better graphics would gain another star or two. Second complaint is the handling of the aircraft. I've flown every kind of real aircraft imaginable, and also in the ultralight class. I've owned more of them than I can count. I've even owned and flown ""2-axis"" aircraft, which I hate, and also 3-axis aicraft which used ""spoilerons"" instead of ailerons. Spoilerons suck. I hate them. But even spoilerons provide a much crisper roll than this thing in Ultrawings. No ultralight handles that sluggishly unless it's actually stalling. Roll control is the worst, but pitch is problematic also. At a cruising speed, any ultralight (except weight shift) will provide a crisp response. Nothing is as mushy as the craft in this game. Interestingly, the yaw response is pretty-much dead-on what it should be. In any case, I do get a lot of enjoyment from this game and would buy any upgraded version. I just hope any upgraded version is SIGNIFICANTLY upgraded. It would be very, very cool to see this include trikes and other weight shift contraptions -- in fact anything that does, or can, or MIGHT fly would be a hoot. I'd pay a lot for a truly comprehensive upgrade. Of all the wild things I've ever flown, ultralights were always, always the most fun.","Sep 27, 2019 at 4:15 PM",2, 29,
2022-05-28 14:29:25.120451,Captain_Howdy,play sitting on the floor,"I have a lazy chair, you know... those that have an electric motor in 'em to move the leg-, and backrest up and down
The problem is that my flightstick is exactly where my physical ""joystick"" is also, but there is some tolerance, so I can grab the flight stick a bit higher (upto my neck...,) but...to climb higher in a bit steep angle I'd need to be able to either put my flightstick hand inside my upper body, or play sitting on the floor or on one of those plastick chairs that you always have to sit on when you visit a lecture or convention.
Unless you enjoy sitting on the kind of chairs that are not made to sit on for hours on end, I'd advise you not to buy this game

Every model comfortable chair with armrests will position most of your controls somewhere inside the chair, or inside your body
This makes flying any plane neigh impossible

Would it really be so hard to have players setup the positions of all controls where it suits them best, you know... just grab, drag, and drop
It may not be super easy to change the positiond of all cockpit instruments

but I'm certain it won't be so difficult that it would take forever to add this option to the program

I've tried moving my chair backwards a bit, and that did help with descending and to a lesser degree with climbing, as far as the switches are concernd, those still end up inside the chair and inside the body

I cannot imagine me being the only one who's bothtered by this sloppy design and lack of customisation  options

IF this functionality would be added to the cockpit I'd give the game a solid 5 stars
Without it, the game gets a meager 1 star for .... just because I have to give at least a real amount of stars

I just don't want to be forced to play a ""flight sim"" sitting on some lousy plastic or wooden (fold-up) chair","Oct 17, 2019 at 4:53 PM",1, 8,
2022-05-28 14:29:25.136409,Scoots4722,For Those Who Loved Pilotwings,"This game is truly fun. The planes are all fun, with a unique feel all their own. I love that all the controls incorporate the Oculus Touch Controllers. I don’t understand those who want VR flight controls on a game pad.

The mini games are fun, and ramp up in difficulty at a reasonable rate. Free flights allow you to play around in the somewhat limited terrain to your heart’s content.

For the developer: Aside from more islands and planes, could I please get a King Kong style monster climbing the statue on that I can shoot down with the sport plane? That’d be awesome.","Aug 21, 2019 at 1:08 PM",5, 7,

If you have a HOTAS it's not too hard to swap buttons around. But cusomising things that require an analog axis like throttle pitch, roll, and yaw become impossible if you don't have the setup they anticipated.

2022-05-28 14:29:25.180290,Falcon_DS_,Too many bugs!!,"I would love to give this game 5 stars because the controls and flying sensation are brilliant.  However, the later islands get really frustrating due to game crushing bugs that are simply unforgivable.  Most of these concern Balloon Popping with the ultralight; the balloons you pop simply don’t register on the later islands (with the ultralight).  I don’t know whether you are not supposed to have the lazer gun on these levels, but if you are, you don’t, forcing you to pop the balloons with the ultralight or the wings which is very difficult and only not to get them to count!!  On one of the levels you are even placed on the ground, off the runway and with no fuel; unforgivable!!  Later levels also have soul crushingly ridiculous time limits, this is not a bug but simply extremely unfair with the level of control this game offers with default virtual hands, which is cool and I love, but not up to HOTAS standards.  If this game has been fully game tested I will eat my Oculus Rift…","May 28, 2019 at 2:04 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 14:29:28.290101,ArcWulf,One of the best VR flying games,"Ultrawings is a refreshing change of pace from the myriad of other half-baked flying/simulation games with messy controls or VR that feels like an after thought. This game's immersive control system and simple yet varied challenges work well and feel more rewarding the more you learn as the game goes on and you unlock the available aircraft. You have the option to use control sticks to fly, but with the hands-on realism style of piloting that feels really fleshed out, you won't want to use anything else. The visual style isn't the most realistic but it has charm all the same and makes the world feel friendly as well as helping with potential motion sickness. I found it easy to sit down with this for hours at a time and just glide around and get lost high up in the laid back atmosphere. 
My only qualms are that sometimes the shooting and photo challenges can feel a bit hard to manage while simultaneously controlling the planes, and it would be nice to have one or two more types of aircraft and challenge mechanics to play with. Maybe wingsuits would be a great add-on? But in any case, if you enjoy flying and immersive simulation, you owe it yourself to give this game a shot. You may find you get quite a bit of enjoyment for the price. Well worth it in my opinion.","May 23, 2019 at 1:26 AM",4, 3,

I've been using the glider for three days now and I have not managed to complete any missions on it. Also when doing the picture missions I have my camera right on the thing and it says it's not in veiw! It's a great game and I do recomend that you should buy it, but prepare to have a very bad time with the glider.

2022-05-28 14:29:28.332493,UrbanLeed,Intuitive and Fun!,"This game is pretty great.  It gives you some convincing flight dynamics without going overboard on detail like a true simulator.  It reminds me a lot of the old PilotWings games on SNES and N64.  I've only been playing a couple hours but I can tell I'm already going to be hooked.  Hasn't gotten me sick yet, but I can imagine that depends a lot on your flying ability.  Someone who has played simulators before or is familiar with piloting dynamics is more likely to keep their plane stable and less motion sickness inducing.

Anyway, definitely worth a try, works great with the touch controllers!","Feb 24, 2019 at 9:15 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 14:29:34.638337,Weyland_8,Incredibly fun experience!,"After some initial issues got ironed out through updates this game is a lot of fun! The controls are intuitive and easy to learn and experiencing flight in VR is a blast. 

I really like the approach that you start off with a slower plane and gradually work yourself up to the faster, more maneuverable stunt plane. That way you gradually build up a stomach for the potentially more motion sickness inducing way of flying. 

I do however find the missions to get the higher tier planes a bit repetitive. And I really, REALLY wish there was a multiplayer aspect to the game. VR experiences that can be shared with friends just adds a whole new level of immersion and really increases the fun factor.

All in all though, a very nice experience and definitely worth its money!

At the devs: sorry for neglecting to update my initial review for so long. Great work with the updates and the overall game guys!","Sep 2, 2018 at 11:52 PM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 14:29:34.653297,awadekar,"Fantastic, relaxing, hectic, all at once","This game at first seems really ordinary, until you really get into it, its just a fantastic smooth and well thought out game. The flight mechanics are really fun and when I started flying my glider with my opposite hand and reaching out of its window to shoot some balloons, I realized this game was actually genius! That was some of the most fun Ive had in VR. I'm not finished with it, but I unlocked the second plane and its already starting to get more interesting.

If you were a big fan of games like Pilot Wings (nintendo) or Sky Odyssey(ps2) you gotta try this, its really fun.

EDIT: Although I have a hotas (for games like Elite and Overload), I opted to use the oculus touch controllers and I think they add a ton to this experience in my opinion, there's something really fun about getting immersed into those controllers being your hands, and the vibration feature actually helps too.","Sep 19, 2018 at 12:06 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 14:29:34.669255,randy.a.parsons,Weird mix of flight realism/ kids gam,"The good:  Pretty good flight models, bug free.  Planes are fairly realistic.
The Bad:  Some cringe worthy gameplay of flying way to close to things, timed missions, which no one likes, takes a long time to get a real plane,  the gliders guns will make you deaf they are about 20 times louder than anything else.  Runways too short, and with obstacles near them.  More game than sim.  Graphics very simple.","Aug 22, 2018 at 7:05 AM",3, 10,
2022-05-28 14:29:34.685212,Philbert311,Great Flightsim,"Offers a very entertaining experience with surprisingly precise controls. Encountered some crashes and bugs, but hopefully they get ironed out (some already did). 

Graphics are nice but could use some more details like birds in the air, fish in the sea and maybe some other planes flying around in freeflight. Also i expect an expansion with with a fourth island/plane. But still a lot to love here, so i already give it 5 stars. Best flightsim yet on the rift in my opinion!

UPDATE: Just wanted to mention that now there are birds, planes and other things that make the world feel more alive. Also forth island and plane. All updates recived for free. Great work devs!

Only downside for me is how the game handles language support. I prefer playing in english but since it got german language support all text are in german with no option to change that while voiceovers stay english. Please add language settings (like every game here on oculus should but often doesnt) and i will give you 6 stars!!","Jun 11, 2018 at 7:14 PM",5, 11,

2022-05-28 14:29:37.807479,Foocha,Simple Flight Sim,"Flying the ultralight for the first time felt kinda meh. I changed the flight controls to sim mode and now I feel like im in control. I love controlling the aircraft with the touch controllers. I'm usally sitting forward hand on the stick for fine control in missions. In free flight i'll sit back and use the right analong stick for the small adjustments while cruising around. I did manage to do a loop in the ultralight, was hoping for an achievement. Although pulling up, putting it into a stall and flipping backwards may not count.

A few things that bug me is the lack of backlighting on the airspeed. When im facing the sun that thing may as well not be there. Had no idea how to progress past the first few missions until I was just flying around and landed at another runway.

Also the instruments are often way to dark to read inside the plane/glider, why would they ever get in so much shadow, there should be more than enough bounce light to make them easily visible even with the sun in front of you.

These two problems do not detracts from this being one of my most played VR titles, its such fun to play and a great pick and play game for when you only have a short amount of spare time.","Apr 23, 2018 at 12:44 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 14:29:40.914311,JonMacBob,Ultra Fun Game.,"Don't be fooled by Ultrawings cartoonesque GFX , this game is quite superb in terms of believeable flight physics especially on simulation mode, The gameplay is very reminiscent of Microsoft Flight, flying through hoops and landing in new areas which you can purchase when you have completed challenges and earned enough in-game currency.. you can also buy new aircraft / offices at unlocked locations throughout the gameworld, each area presents a new set of challenges which become more difficult. The progression is relatively challenging even on arcade mode.    

The GFX are colourful, crisp and cheerful , performance is excellent on my 980, the sound effects are also realistic whilst in flight, the music score suits the game perfectly  , I'm looking forward to playing more of this game over the coming weeks , I highly recommend this game to anyone, a perfect game for all the family.","Apr 12, 2018 at 7:07 AM",5, 6,

There's a nice variety of mission types, the flight-physics are relatively realistic, and challenging. And the simpler-turning option is good for noobs and giving VR demos.
Biggest bug still seems to be that they left physics enabled on the in-game laptop.. so it tends to glitch out..
Also, I'd like to see a more inland mountain-range-style map someday. And I kinda wish we had access to the weapons or other special features used in missions, more in the freeflight mode, so we could shoot at randomly generated baloon targets or whatever lol.
I love the Touch control method, and I think they've improved it over several updates.
Random side note: Anyone think the male instructor voice sounds a bit like Wil Wheaton?
I hope the devs can add more to this over time. If not, I hope Ultrawings 2 gets multiplayer, cause that would be amazing. I'd love dogfighting in this game!

2022-05-28 14:29:44.096943,FolkSong,Ultra Fun,"I've had a Rift for over 6 months and own dozens of games, and this is one of my favourites. I like the idea of flight sims, but the serious ones can be a bit boring to actually play. Ultrawings is great to just pick up and immediately start having fun. 

The physics are probably not as realistic as top flight sims, but they're actually decently realistic in simulation mode (you can stall for example). The graphics are simple, but the aesthetic works and it runs great.

Using Touch controls to flip switches in the cockpit and work the joystick is really immersive. That said, I found myself mostly using the thumbsticks to fly after the first few hours, because it's tiring to hold your arm in the air without having a physical stick to grab on to.

The missions have enough variety to keep me from getting bored, and trying to achieve a gold medal on every mission is a satisfying challenge.

By the way, don't get discouraged if you find the starting plane a bit slow - there are two more unlockable planes that are more exciting to fly.","Mar 5, 2018 at 9:30 AM",5, 5,

This game perfectly balances realism with the practicality of the limitations of VR.  And you can choose whether you want an arcade or a simulation experience in any event if you find the simulation just a little bit too difficult.  Althought I do recommend the simulation mode.

You have the same challenges of flying through rings, time challenge etc so it is similar in many respects.

No enjoyment to be had. I really wanted to like this game, I really did. So I stuck with it for a good 2 hours making sure I wasnt giving up too soon.

Flying is an incredible experience which this game does very well for an early VR game.  The graphics and settings make it a comfortable experience from the very beginning, and things like speed and tight rotations and turns are gradually introduced as you progress through the game.

Shooting balloons with a handgun is immense fun and something I didn't know I wanted badly in a multiplayer game (come on make one devs!). You start off with just an ultra light plane, the first acquired plane I got through doing jobs was the rocket powered glider-- that just blew my mind. However this game could cause motion sickness, if you are prone to that take that into consideration (there are comfort options). After my brain adjusted and started to focus on points in the landscape instead of dead center and the wings cutting through the air, I was fine. Good physics help too, movement matches the expected reality.

The game has a very interesting and simple premise. It's about flight. And the joy of simple flying. A very good medium for introduction to flight to newcomers as well as a very good test of VR features. It is unfortunate, however, that the game displays so few features. Few Game Modes, Few Variation of planes, Few environements. Also some very sought-after features lacking; Weather, Season, Visual Effects. These could all be only cosmetics. But definitely lacking. 
Another Negative (probably the biggest) is the sounds and Music. Very lacking, too simplistic and that cute tune, is the only tune. Very annoying after about 5 minutes.","Jun 29, 2017 at 10:56 PM",3, 5,We do have multiple music tracks but they play based on the island you're currently at!

But still you can turn it off and just play something of your own on your PC if you want, and you'll most likely want to.

The flight model is nice (convincing without being too simmy), the sound is great, the control scheme is mostly good, and there's a few really good game modes. 
There's two modes which are basically standard checkpoint races, which are fine. There's a mode where you have to land in tricky spots, which is fun. Photo mode (find a particular landmark and take a picture from the correct angle) should be great, but it's ridiculously fussy and doesn't give you much help if you don't quite get the shot right. 
The best thing is balloon mode, where you have a gun in one hand to shoot balloons as you fly past. Brilliant fun in the micro-light, but as far as I can tell it's impossible with the glider as you don't get a gun (that I can find), and popping them with the plane doesn't count. I'm sure I'm missing something, but it's not at all clear what.
The difficulty level is a bit all over the place. Some missions are trivial, while some are frustratingly difficult.
The unlock structure also feels a bit steep. I get that they need to spread the content out, but unlocking the 5th landing strip costs a fortune.

It has been fixed in an update and works much much better now, dare a say 'solved.' Have a go and tell us what you think. If you agree how about bumping up that star rating sir.

2022-05-28 14:30:18.993677,IliacCrest,Proves touch can work for flight sim,"I'm a hardcore DCS simmer, but I can appreciate Ultrawings for what it is: a light, recreational sim that's good, simple fun. Haven't experienced any technical issues or crashes (other than the pilot induced kind). Kudos for being the first flight sim with touch support. Here's hoping for many more.","Feb 27, 2017 at 7:59 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 14:30:19.010632,lessthanzach,Finally a touch enabled flight sim,I've been asking for this as soon as I saw Touch revealed and it's finally here after many months of me pestering the developers on their Facebook page.  Graphics are simple but look good in VR.  Controls are very well done and planes control very nicely.  I definitely want to see more planes added and some new maps.  I'd also love some multiplayer that makes use of the rift mic and filters the voice to make it sound like it's coming through the flight comms.,"Mar 3, 2017 at 6:17 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 14:30:19.025592,Crypstik,Great Fun,"This game/flight sim is really good fun.  The graphics are very nice and even though not photo realistic there is so much imersion from them. The controls are really easy to use and well done.  Picking jobs using a laptop is great and to transition from the hanger to the cockpit by putting your helmet on is brilliant.  I hope extra islands, airports, missions and ofcourse aircraft are added.","Feb 23, 2017 at 9:28 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 14:30:22.169314,Boge1,Great game for the price.,"Many hours of gaming which isn't apparent at first. Several different planes to unlock, each with different mechanics, as well as additional airports. I had a blast trying to gold star each challenge. After playing for a better part of a day I'm only 25% complete. Well worth the money!","Mar 6, 2017 at 5:45 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 14:30:22.202226,Thum0s,Not much there,"So far the game has crashed twice during training and induced a lot of nausea. It's not clear yet how much content there is in the game. I will explore the game more and update this with a higher rating if I discover more content (assuming I can adjust to the nausea). (Pro tip: to turn off the music look to your left and turn the dial on the radio... I like the control scheme!) UPDATE: Dropping my review score because now, after coming back to the game a few hours later, the game is constantly crashing when I try to go into the course job.","Feb 22, 2017 at 6:04 AM",1, 8,
2022-05-28 14:30:22.219181,Werbenjagermanjensen,"Needs more content, but really fun as is","I really like this game. The feeling of making a big banking turn is much like that of being in a real airplane. (I get kinda woosy if we do circles) 

It does need more content though, and I would really love to see a multiplayer aspect be added. There are 3 planes so far and it would be great if we could dogfight each other. One of my favorite games of my childhood was Red Baron on the Imagination Network. It was simple dogfighting, but it was a blast and a game like this could really benefit from something like that. I'm sure there's more to come, and I can't wait to play it. 

Worth the money in my opinion.","Mar 1, 2017 at 1:10 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 14:30:22.236135,BobTagab,A fun VR flightsim set back by bugs,"I had quite a bit of fun playing this when everything worked smoothly. I like the style and design even though it's not what would really be good for a serious flight sim, which this really isn't. I do wish it had a bit larger of a plane choice however. That being said, for all the fun that it is, it's set back by bugs at almost every step of the way that either kill the game or force me to restart. The two biggest ones that I've had so far is the failure to load the mission if I hit the laptop as I'm putting the helmet on, and the sudden loss of the ability to grip in game objects with a Touch controller. Minus those, the game would be great for what it is, a fun and casual flight game.","Feb 24, 2017 at 8:56 AM",3, 1,

Also, be sure that you are not pointing at the helmet when you try and pick it up or you will push it instead. If you like the fix how about upping your rating. Every review counts!
