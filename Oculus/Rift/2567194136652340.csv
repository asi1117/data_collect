But then a realized, that there are only 3 missions and 3 horde areas. And you are constantly low on ammo. So you have to run in circles, searching for yellow ammo blimps.
But the music is cool.","Jul 16, 2020 at 1:27 AM",3, 11,
2022-05-28 20:46:16.769344,Drawhen,"Good Grafics, that´s unfurtunately all.","I played only the first Level of the game. The grafics are good but you have no active reloading for the guns (you need to hold the A-Button) and you can´t hold a two handed weapon with two hands. Yes, that´s right you can´t hold the shotgun at the slide noir pump it. Very unfurtunate it looked promissing but now I have to return it.","Jul 3, 2020 at 2:20 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 20:46:16.784304,BLZDPraetorian,HELP!,So when I start the game On my oculus Quest Via virtual desktop the menu screen is not working well. almost like the screen is cut off just a little bit to where I cant see some of the buttons. Like the resolution is not right. But I cant see or find a options menu to find it! I will change my rating the second I fix this but for now its a big problem =[,"Aug 25, 2020 at 12:07 PM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 20:46:16.798267,diemensionx,who reviews these games,"this is like a generic type game, there is loads of shooters like this and it feels like the same person makes them all, not as bad as some but not enough to keep it installed.","Mar 24, 2020 at 2:50 AM",2, 8,
2022-05-28 20:46:16.813227,uno.aphex,New Xmas Update Review,"Pros : Fun gun play, lots of variety in enemy types, auto reload is awesome, I like the arcade style pickup

Updated Review Since Update; Thanks for the smooth turning, That's awesome. The speed situation seems sorted out. The only thing I could say is give us a slider for smooth turning speed and this game will officially be legendary status. The default speed I find is rather slow but I still much prefer it to snap turning. Being able to tweak the speed would be awesome. The new Missions are sweet aswell, Maybe add some more weapons too in the future? This is really a great step in the right direction all together. It's worth the 5 Stars.","Dec 27, 2019 at 12:49 PM",5, 10,
