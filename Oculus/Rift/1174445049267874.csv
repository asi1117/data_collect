The only confusing bit was the beginning since as other reviewers mentioned it seems to start paused so you have to press a button to unpause it.  Other than that it was perfect, emotional and an amazing experience.  20/10.","Feb 7, 2020 at 2:22 PM",5, 8,

Anyway, once underway it is some emotional loaded rollercoaster movie/drawing. I cried a little. It's very gripping and takes advantage of VR in a very new way, new to me at least. For free it's a must have.","Oct 22, 2019 at 5:42 PM",5, 19,

Edit 05-04-2020  DEVS - any chance of addressing this issue?  I'd sure like to see this.

Bummer.  I got the Walking or Seated option and then the title screen but after that, nothing.  And yes - I too, have the gaming computer and bandwidth from hell so that isn't the issue.","Oct 18, 2020 at 11:39 AM",5, 9,

Not only do you get a touching story, not only do you get gorgeous artwork, but you get to see it all drawn around you as the story unfolds and can move around and view the artwork in full 3D. This is an entirely new art form unfolding before our eyes and it moved me like nothing else has. If you have access to VR and haven't experienced this, you're doing it wrong.

If you are getting a black screen, then check your network connection.
I tried seated and standing, and got a black screen with audio on both. I quit and was just about to give up when I noticed my internet connection was down. After fixing it, I decided to try again.

2022-05-28 17:36:21.226325,BluePlayer,Waste of time :(,"Spoiler warning: It's about a kid who lost her mom.

That's... that's literally the entire story.
Tons of text to say nothing but:
""Mom I miss you, btw you were an actress and for some reason to this day I am still not over your death and I am watching all your movies to the point of being dellusional.

That's it, no she got over it, no impactful moments no nothing, this is all there is to it.

I disliked the animation style, I disliked the horrible font they used which isn't very readable at times, I disliked how there was nothing at all on the characters, just ""Hi mom you died, you are an actress, kthx bye""

This would have been nicer had there been actual story content in this, there wasn't any, this isn't twilight bad, this is the first paragraph of twilight as the entire movie levels of bad.

THIS WAS NOT A BETTER LOVE STORY THAN TWILIGHT.

Save your time and don't bother, they could have at least made it look good to make up for the lack of story but nope, they chose a terrible art style.

Oh and it probably took you longer to read this review than the entire dear angela nonsense, so at the very least you got double your 0 dollars worth in content!

Side note: seems like a pretty sweet way to tell a story, now if only there was this thing called books that they could have used to animate literally anything at all... 

Here I got a sequel for you it's called dear Monica, here is the entire thing:
Dear Monica, you were my aunt and not Mom but you died anyway and also you were an engineer, you may not have designed any machine you ever built but I would still credit it to you, for example remember when you totally invented the television? now let's see televisions and what they can do, wow aunt Monica you are so amazing.
Also you died in the woods by a vampire.
His name was something from twilight and this is a better love story than twilight, also this is VR so we'll get away with this.

The use of 360 degree space to create compositions that wrap around you not just horizontally, but also above and below you, and near and far was so well done!
