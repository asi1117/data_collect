On one stage I literally had glitchy graphics and had to bend down so as not to be stuck in a view that kept jumping. Couldn't change the settings either; selecting the ""options"" took me straight to game play! (Thought maybe I needed to lower the settings). Couldn't figure out a lot of what was going on, and I've played many VR shooters... Backdrops are nice to look at however, but I agree with the reviewers that the spiders are a bit too dark to see most times. And those pistols have flames coming out of them so it's VERY hard to see what you're aiming at... Overall, I love the settings and the huge captain is killer, but overall it's a very difficult game to play, mainly because you can't see what you're shooting at. I probably won't come back to this one, sadly...","Jan 18, 2019 at 12:18 PM",2, 2,
