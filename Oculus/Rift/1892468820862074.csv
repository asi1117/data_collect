2022-05-28 16:39:08.049812,onesmashedbro,Its a blast,"So far I have already spent a lot of time buying games to be let down or want a refund. This game is NOT one of those games , no it is a game that is a blast to play and easy to get into . Love the gameplay mechanics and to be honest, its one of the better strategy games out.","Apr 4, 2019 at 5:32 PM",5, 18,

My Quick Thoughts:
A polished strategy experience where you command your troops with the ability to craft and upgrade cards.
Another great game from the creators of Arizona Sunshine.","Apr 5, 2019 at 6:16 AM",4, 11,
