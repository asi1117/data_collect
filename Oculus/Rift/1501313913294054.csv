2022-05-28 17:48:40.590790,syclonix,Frustrating VR implementation,"There's a fun game underneath here somewhere, but the VR implementation has two frustrating issues: 1) Rifle alignment/position keeps shifting after reload making it increasingly difficult to aim with each shot; this is especially frustrating if you're using a gunstock. The weapon alignment settings don't appear to help this issue. 2) ""Player out of bounds"" message shows up whenever you slightly intersect with objects in the level. This breaks the pace of gameplay as you constantly have to adjust your body to make sure you're not touching any objects; quite interruptive and immersion-breaking. It would be better to either ""push"" the player out of the objects, or make the ""out of bounds"" warning optional.

I really hope these two issues get patched out. It seems like a fun game, but right now it's hard to have fun with it.",Nov 10 at 11:10 AM,3, 20,
2022-05-28 17:48:40.606747,Lagge82,OK game but with flaws.,"update. this game is not fixed. sound orientation is completly wrong after playing awail. verry hard to hear enemys from the wrong direction. make hard levels harder and makes me rage quit. down to 2 from 3 stars.

Nice to have a story driven ""shooter"" again. Sadly this game feel a little clunky.
The sniping is pretty much spot on. Shooting with other weapons are good.
I have 2 BIG problem, one is that ""out of bounds"" happen verry easy, even if im not standing i a wall or something. 
The sound is terreble, not the sound it self but location of sound. It doesnt follow me when turning physically only when stick-turning.
Example, if im standing and hearing something in my left ear, turning around with left thumbstick and the sound follows to my right ear.
But if i turn physically (playing wireless so i prefer this) the sound stays in my left ear.  This takes away much of the immersion and i stop play because it annoys me verry much. 
Developers you should really fix theese 2 problems fast, they make this pretty good game feel clunky",Nov 30 at 6:26 PM,2, 4,

2022-05-28 17:48:43.755325,Aryso,"If you like vr shooters, dont buy","update: game has been updated, shooting remains similar

the assault rifle shooting is awful compared to other vr shooters ive played (onward, zero caliber) and other vr games with guns (like boneworks) . You feel like you're gonna miss most of the time, and you do. fine movement has a bad time registering. You need to move the wrong hand if you want to aim your gun somewhere else. the correct hand is also low in sensitivity, needing to move it about twice as far as would be intended. Your gun pivots without returning to the intended position when you move it closer to your body.

 Think of it like this. you grab a longer gun, and when you it move flat against your body and let go of the hand that is not on the trigger, the gun will stay there instead of moving back into its normal position, and the movement of it is now off center, for lack of a better word. Its like suddenly deciding to hold your gun sideways despite your hand aiming forwards. Any direction you point your gun in, it will stay there unlike many VR shooters where it moves back to the ""aiming forwards"" position.

the sniper shooting is fine at best.",Oct 1 at 5:43 PM,3, 2,"Hi there Aryso,
We introduced a bunch of customisation options which we think will take care of many of these complaints for you! We've taken many of our cues from other VR shooters in making these options work better for players with different preference.

Please consider going to options and tweaking your settings before giving us another review with options which are closer to experiences you've enjoyed in VR.

Best wishes,
Ross."
2022-05-28 17:48:43.770286,Vox-Multis,I really wish I could enjoy this game,"UPDATE: The game has recently been updated with a lot of fixes, but the issue I've had from the beginning still exists. I'm afraid I'll have to knock my review down to 1 star so long as it persists.
---

This should be a great game, but technical issues have frustrated me from Day 1. Initially I was plagued by an ""Out of Bounds"" error whenever getting too close to any object, or even when leaning out a window or over a crate when my head didn't actually intersect with anything. They've fixed that in the PCVR version, but I've also found that positional audio remains static no matter which direction I'm facing, meaning if I hear something to my left and turn that direction, I STILL hear it in my left ear - so in effect I have no way of knowing which direction any given sound is coming from. I've tried everything I could think of to fix this on my end, including installing the latest video and audio drivers for my hardware, all to no avail.

I don't have this problem running the game natively on my Quest 2, so tonight I thought instead of waiting for another patch I'd try playing that way, in spite of the drop in graphics quality. So I loaded up the game on my headset only to find that version STILL has those Out of Bounds issues that were plaguing me at the start. I can only assume that patch hasn't been pushed out to the Quest version, in spite of the fact that it was implemented on PCVR weeks ago.

Long story short: this game has been little more than frustrating for me, as I feel as though I've been actively prevented from enjoying it in any form since I bought it at launch.",Sep 18 at 6:23 AM,1, 3,

2022-05-28 17:48:43.800205,haloff1,One of the best VR sniping games,"I played this game on PC with Oculus Quest using Virtual Desktop and Air Link.
I cleared all missions with 3 stars on Sniper Elite, got the best score on the last mission, and got all collectibles. Here is my quick review:

There are 18 missions. Each mission can take from 5 minutes to more than 30 minutes. The late missions are especially the longest. The game is quite linear. Except for a couple of moment, there is only one way path. Still, compared to current VR games, it's still very good.
According to statistics, it seems like I played it just 8 hours…but I am quite sure I played it more that…I think you can easily play it for 8 hours just to finish the campaign once, and up to 25 hours if you want to master every weapons. It’s purely a solo game with a campaign and no extra game mode.

There are three difficulties. The last mode, authentic/sniper elite is quite challenging, in a good way. Adjusting for bullet drop and especially the wind gave me a lot of trouble... Anyway, this sniping experience cannot be found in any other VR games, except maybe Outward, but I didn’t play that game yet. It has one of the most realistic bullet physics in VR games. The X-ray cam is so satisfying. You can even adjust its frequency if it becomes annoying.

I finished the game once without gun stock, and another time with gun stock. To be honest, I feel like no gun stock is better…but it might be because I am used to free hands. 

There are 5 categories of weapons: pistol, submachine gun, shotgun, rifle, and explosive (grenade and panzerfaust). The rifles were the most interesting. I think there are like 8 rifles or so? You can find the full list on reddit. Each gun is unique with different damage, bullet physics, rate of fire etc… You can make your own loadout. 

In conclusion, considering the other currently available vr games, I give it a 9/10 rating. 10/10 on Quest as there is nothing comparable.",Oct 10 at 12:30 AM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:48:46.884955,FutureShock_,Great on both platforms (Quest 2 & PCVR),"I'm only about half-way through but overall I'm pretty satisfied. It's basically a Sniper Elite game, translated to the VR medium (which is, let's be honest, more suited for this type of game). 

Pros: 

- Kill cam never gets old
- The way the game handles scopes is ace
- Challenging with customizable difficulty and mechanics, making it easier to jump in from any other VR shooter
- Level design and gameplay can be a bit traditional but the sniping mechanics make it a cut above
- Good performance on PC 
- Quest 2 visuals a mile beyond many similar Quest 2 games with larger draw distances, lots of alpha effects (other games seem to struggle with this), sharper textures and larger poly counts
- Get to kill Nazis and watch their bodily organs/bones rupture up close 

Cons: 

- For some reason, AA and AAA developers don't learn from popular VR shooters with refined mechanics like Onward, Pavlov, and Alyx while developing their games and instead try to reinvent the wheel. The weapon, kit, and world interactions are reminiscient of early, 2016 VR games and the Sniper Elite VR suffers as a result. Weapon interactions are clunky and imprecise. 
- The PC version retains some of the polycounts and blob shadows of the Quest version, meaning it was probably developed for the Quest platform first then ported to PC
- Stealth mechanics are hit or miss. The AI can find a body then go back to their original level of alertness within ten seconds.
- Mission structure can get repetitive
- AI can be dumb when up close and bum rush you like lemmings, making the more CQB-oriented missions a slog",Jul 12 at 1:39 AM,4, 56,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LMLRqmoQBA

My Initial Impressions:
My Impressions are going to cover all Formats, PC, Quest 2 and PSVR.
The game plays great on all formats, the gunplay is realistic and the missions are fun.
The sniping element works perfect in VR and is the most realistic way to play such a game. The skill level is BASED on your OWN real life interactions. Just like holding and firing a gun in real life.
The Quest 2 and PC versions look better than the PSVR version.
Both the PC and the PSVR have better textures and draw distance than the Quest 2.
On PC and Quest 2 you manually reload your weapons with the Touch controllers.
On PSVR you play the game with the AIM controller which represents a gun in the game. With the AIM Controller loading weapons is automatic ONLY.
For me this is the MOH game in VR I was hoping for. I'm a massive fan of these types of games and in VR this is going to be a MASSIVE hit!.",Jul 9 at 4:59 AM,5, 52,

 the sniper rifles are fantastic to use but i also have to say that i loved all the other weapons and particularly the welrod as a fabulous realoding mecanism .
the game has a nice story and as an italian i founded the locations realistics but
 i felt the graphics were a bit off in large landscapes 
and sometimes the npc shoted my through the walls

2022-05-28 17:48:46.946789,Skillexx,Exciting stuff,"The sniping is awesome, there are very exciting scenarios. Reloading generally is quite fiddly, I can’t pull the pin on a grenade without doing the “Saturday night fever dance” 6 times first, because it just doesn’t grip, and with the SMG it’s very tricky to either grip the gun or reload, so there is some super fiddly stuff. On the other hand the story is fun, the sounds are great, and generally speaking it’s super immersive and exciting. I give it 5 stars because it feels vastly superior to most of the games out there right now, even if it’s not perfect.",Sep 15 at 7:59 PM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:48:50.040515,term_vr,Not a fan.  Here is why...,"Very basic game.  Linear, zero exploration, story fed to you, basically just a way point simulator.  

Positional audio very poor.  Sounds constantly like enemies behind me, when they aren't.

The gun mechanics are so clumsy.  Can only hold the gun in 2 points?

Constant ""Out of Bounds"" black screen when trying to take cover...

Physically crouching doesnt stealth...

The gun-over-shoulder to stash mechanic is poorly implemented, the gun often just falls right on the ground.

There's no ability to 2 hand pistols.  Seriously, if you try to, it just pulls the mag out.  Please take a lesson in gun mechanics from Into the Radius.  They did it right there.

NPC shooting me through a wall is not a fun way to die.

The alyx glove pull implementation barely works.  Physically grabbing things isn't much better.  I put my hands RIGHT ON a box of ammo, grab, and it doesn't register. 

The grenades I throw them and they land right in front of me.  I don't want to use the arcade style throwing mechanism.  Just make regular throwing actually work right please.  

The bullet tracers are immersion breaking and out of place for a WW2 shooter.  If there's a setting to turn them off, my bad.  But seriously them being on by default is weird.  This doesn't feel like a gritty WW2 simulator... it feels like a silly arcade game.

The constant ping of the waypoint marker is immersion breaking and SO annoying.

The pacing of the game is just weird and terrible.  I played on the hardest setting, and the enemies aren't interesting at all.  They mostly sit in one place, and lock onto you the second you peak. 

All in all the gameplay is just boring.  There's no innovation here at all.  It's a hallway shooter with basic graphics, basic gun mechanics, and basic story.  If it absolutely nailed the interactions, I'd give it a three star at best due to how basic it is.  But the fact that the interactions aren't working correctly and often get in the way is a bummer.",Jul 15 at 1:23 PM,1, 21,Just to let you know that we are investigating the issues raised and that there is an update currently in development.
2022-05-28 17:48:50.055475,dtdman420,Loving it!,"You have to love that signiture KILL CAM. So cool in VR.

The scope mechanics are also done very well and on the hardest difficulty other factors need to be considered when setting up that perfect snipe shot from a distance. LOVING IT.

There is also different customization options for surely every VR player ALMOST, I hear it does not play well with gun stocks but I don't know because I don't own one.

GREAT JOB DEVS!  i HOPE TO SEE MANY MORE SNIPER ELITE GAMES COME TO VR.

Even if they are full vr ports of previous titles that would be great as well.

2022-05-28 17:48:50.086392,Vorpal_,Good but only for rock steady hands,"This a great game if you enjoy WW2 shooters. The sniping feels good and is pretty realistic especially on the Authentic difficulty setting. The music is great and the story is pretty good as well. However be forewarned, if you have any kind of trembling in your hands you will find this game very difficult to play. 

People with slight tremble in their hands can usually aim real world guns just fine as there is an actual physical object to hold on to, with weight that absorbs the vast majority of trembling. Unless you happen to have it really bad that is. But the weapons in this game feel as if they are made of air and there is no weight simulation or motion smoothing added at all except when you are fully ""focused"" by having to hold down the left trigger for several seconds. So therefore I can only fully recommend this game to those with absolutely rock steady hands. Everyone else should maybe wait to see if they add more options later.",Jul 12 at 4:58 AM,4, 9,

Graphics arnt all that great but that not really a huge issue for me and i know its only because this game can be played on the quest 2 alone, im playing with link cable on pc so i expected better graphics and it still felt like i was on the quest 2. Dialog and story is petty good. only problem i have at the moment would just be the weapon mechanics which i am hoping they fix in future update. I would have rated it 4 stars but the maps are so tiny compared to what sniper elite use to be, sniper elite made it feel like it was semi open world while this one keeps you in a tiny area but its only because it was pretty much made for the quest 2. Its not like a horrible experience but as of right now i would give this game like a 6 out of 10. If the weapons are fixed then probably a 7.5/10.

Fun atmosphere and story.
Graphics are nice, would ’t say great but happy with them overall.
Great WW2 setting.
Sniper mechanics are really fun on the hardest level with having to squeeze the trigger, wind, gravity drop, etc.

Cons:
Gun handling such as gripping and re-loading are clunky at best, compared to Onward, Contractors to name a couple this needs a lot of work.
Getting a lot of out of bounds black screens in places I shouldn’t.
Machine guns and pistol handling are average at best, with no two-handed pistols.
Gun angle seems to change every time I pick up the same gun with the dominant hand.
Sneak vinaigrette is horrible,  sends me crossed-eyed for some reason, needs a toggle to turn it off.

For me once the gun handling and sneak vinaigrette is fixed will be a great game.",Aug 13 at 12:14 PM,2, 0,Hey there. We have addressed as number of issues which will hopefully improve your experience. Please get in contact if you have further suggestions. We love to hear from you.
2022-05-28 17:48:53.222006,Kent,directional audio broken in this version,"The directionial audio is all wrong in the Oculus rift store version. I played this version with my Vive Pro using revive and with my  Quest 2 using airlink. The audio is Really disorienting in both headsets. I'm sure they're aware of this and working on a fix. It makes this version pretty much unplayable. In the Quest and Steam versions the directional audio is fine. I recommend those versions as this is a fun game for the price.
Grabbing is janky, very difficult to grab ammo/guns right in front of you, it is easier but still difficult to Force-grab from a distance. 
I'm Always getting black screen saying out of bounds, return to center when I'm using my room space to move around in. Im also getting out of bounds fix height calibration screen. I prefer when VR games don't go black and your in game position is just frozen when you're trying to roomscale some place you can't go in game, so that it doesn't totally break immersion.  It also goes black a lot when I'm just trying to duck in real life. 
It's really hard to aim down and see the iron sights of most guns,  all the iron sights need glow in the dark paint as the games contrast is low.. It's like you're expected to just fire from the hip and use the tracer rounds when you're not sniping. But tracer bullets don't feel that great and drop fast or arch it seems...
Some guns iron sights are not accurate,
It's really hard to pull empty magazines out of pistols, they need an eject button on the controller. A release slide button for appropriate guns would also be nice.  The non sniper guns are too laggy/smoothed when moving them around in space as well. I still like the game on Steam but wish it was better and more expensive.",Jul 29 at 1:55 AM,1, 2,"Just to let you know that we are investigating the issues raised and that there is an update currently in development.

2022-05-28 17:48:53.237963,TeddyBear82,Very good and unique cross buy game!,"This is what I was hoping for for MOH before the reviews poured in, the huge download size and performance issues.

Positives after playing an hour or so:

(1) love the way the story and chapters are integrated in a VR way rather than “point and click”

(2) solid graphics 

(3) moves quickly with adequate stops to save 

(4) great implementation of world war theme

(5) runs nice and clear and smooth on Virtual Desktop with oculus rift version

(6) good amount of movement, graphics options like smooth vs snap turn, teleport vs. smooth, toggle grip or realistic grip, manual vs auto reload.  On this one it’s kind of odd and sad for VR in general we have to celebrate devs for including options that have been in VR games all the way back since Serious Sam VR years ago but ...here we are.

A negative or two that knocks off one star, except see below I am giving it 5 stars because of cross buy:
(1) when I use the sniper rifle, I find that to reload I reload with my right hand while holding the gun with my left which is great but to avoid the gun going haywire when bringing it back to shoot again I have to left go quickly and regrab with the left hand.  This isn’t a huge deal because I am playing with realistic grip but would be more of a pain with toggle grip.  Not sure why the tracking does this.

(2) I think, but might be wrong, that grenades only explode if you use them with a button control rather than throwing them.  

Finally thanks so much for cross buy! That, and pricing this at $30 instead of $50, makes up the star that would be lost based on the above issues, so back to 5 stars.",Jul 11 at 1:28 AM,5, 3,

Game runs beautifully on the Quest 2. I couldn't believe how awesome the graphics are (for a Quest 2 game, mind you).

My beef is with the PC VR version. I was expecting high quality textures, models, effects. Found virtually none of those. The quality is so similar to the mobile version that I don't honestly think it's worth the space it's taking on my desktop.

Cross buy! (Any devs reading this. If you use Oculus as a platform please always include cross buy) 
Great length of play for the price
Recreates the iconic feel of the series in VR
Good linear fps with story elements
Gives player control of UI 
Quest version allows tuning trigger activation 
Kill cams are masterfully done

Cons:
There are some weapon control issues with the active grip type. Weapon handling can cause player frustration. This is most noticable when pulling a bolt back with dominant hand. Noticed off hand reloading tends to be smoother by not allowing the grab point of the handle of a rifle preventing the weapon from rotating when reloading.
While the graphics are better on PC the Quest version of this game overall plays better. 
Removes some key sniping features from previous Sniper Elite titles( scope zeroing, enviornment affects like wind on bullet slope, allowing change of magnification with out tapping into focus controls) 
 Some AI moments can be wonky, like shooting through walls in cqb fights

I had high hopes going into Sniper Elite VR seeing the potential for flat screen games to finally start making their way into our headsets. This is a fantastic game with some room for improvement. 

The story is a few hours of linear or defensive missions mixed with some stealth. Global leader board support and weapon challenges leaves the player with a fair amount of replayability 

For a game that takes the camera view away from the player, Sniper Elite VR nails its iconic slow motion kill cams.

Over all this game achieves a familiar gameplay expierence while completely changing the way we play it. For that I rate it a 5/5 with a few things to point out for future support of this game.

Weapon control needs to be updated, please consider giving players more control over what % of which hand influences weapon handling.

It's the first time in my gamer's life where I'm facing a shooting game where you can't shoot because of a bug. Very often, when I'm trying to pull the trigger, the sniper gun won't shoot the bullet out. I can see the trigger of the gun moving but no bullet comes out and I'm dying cause the ennemies kill me. WTF devs!!!
It's not a problem due to an empty magazine cause there's ammunitions in the gun when this bug occurs. No matter how much ammunitions I have, sometimes the gun refuses to shoot. It's a total shame guys, even more in a shooting game! 

There is also these stupid black bars coming in front of my view when I'm crouching. Sometimes they're here, sometimes they disappear, sometimes they flash in and out just in my line of sight with no reason... Great idea devs... Could you please give us an option to totally disable these bars? I know when I'm crouching or when I'm standing. Thx
Once again I'm not talking about the comfort options which reduces the Fov for sensitive people in VR. These are the crouching bars which annoy me so so much.

Then could you please give us the option to disable the irritating sound which pops up every time the objectives are appearing around us? It's really really annoying. It breaks all the immersion and gives me the will to uninstall the game. I don't want to hear this sound anymore or at least could you reduce its frequence of appearence?

I hope to have an answer and to see all these bugs rectified before continuing to play the game.",Jul 17 at 5:54 AM,2, 0,"Hi there Djneo,
Thank you for your feedback, we really appreciate it and the enthusiasm you're bringing to the game.

The lack of firing on pulling the trigger may be connected to you pulling it too quickly/hard, which we've had as a true to life representation of needing that steady squeeze for a sniper kill. Would you be able to try squeezing a little more gently, as that would confirm beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is a bug which needs more attention. Hopefully this will make it so you can play and enjoy the game once more, and we are looking at the vignette also, as well as having patched many of the audio issues in the game already."
2022-05-28 17:48:59.597952,L_etranger,Another one,"Can't recommend the game for now :
• The hands are offset by 3-4 cm (tested on native Quest 2 and PC Oculus).
• When you grab your rifle handle, the hand teleport on on the weapon handle (adding another offset) instead to adjusting the weapon angle / position to fit in the hands.
• Feel like there is a 1 second smoothing latency that forbid any quickl elite sniping.",Jul 11 at 5:39 AM,2, 1,Improvements have been made in release 1.02.

In this case you often grab  the gun instead of the slider.  Same goes for picking up and storing weapons. Too often you grab somehing you didn't want to.

2022-05-28 17:49:05.928021,DDay619,"No gunstock support, one handed pistols","I'm super disappointed so far. How can you make a game like this and NOT optimize it in any way for those of us with physical gun stocks? I just got done with the gun range and there is no way to use a pistol with two hands, WTF?! I was pretty excited for this game, but kept my epectations in check. 

The game looks pretty, but it's also JANKY. World interaction, such as picking up objects and reloading, is total rubbish. The gun play is considerably worse than Medal of Honor, but the kill cam is pretty friggin' sweet. Overall, the game is much better paced, but racking the bolt (both with and without using the gunstock) is just so fickle that I had to turn on automatic reloading, ugh. Operating the lever action and bolt action guns in MOH felt amazing and was very reliable. 

PLEASE TAKE OFF THE TRAINING WHEELS! Not being able to operate the action when the gun runs out of ammo is immersion breaking. Not being able to drop the magazine or release the slide, or bolt, after reloading with a button press absolutely sucks.

With both this game and MOH, I'm simply left wondering: What were they thinking? Who made these decisions?",Jul 11 at 9:31 AM,2, 9,"Hi there!

Thanks again, the Rebellion team."
2022-05-28 17:49:05.944977,Hicks613,"Good, but not without its problems","Upated: since Developer's response and spending more time in-game.
Developers are ""investigating the issue"" but not sure what this means as I covered a few items.  Eagerly awaiting patches.

Developers could have at least played some other games (besides HL: Alyx) to find out what works for controls.  Gravity glove mechanics were not necessary in this title.  It doesn't fit the narrative and there are other games that do this better that the developers could have copied.

Rifles feel like broomsticks - and they all feel exactly the same.  I thought there were 2 types of rifles but I had some other players tell me there was more...and that I've actually used these but had no idea as they all feel the same.  The world is actually a pretty dull and lifeless place.  You can't open doors/windows/cupboards.  It is all pretty static and uninteresting. I know this was all built for Quest in mind.  It shows.

My vr hands are a few inches above my real hands.

There is no head orientated steering, so this game makes me ill. I can't walk toward my object and scan left and right for enemies without drunkenly stumbling left and right.

There is also no two-handed pistol gripping.  What. The. Hell.

There is a push button duck, but I wish there was a push button prone system.
If you duck in real life you can push this button to go prone - or at least it appears that way - we need clarification on this.  

Please for the love of anything, have the weapon interactions use trigger (bolts, firing modes etc) and have grip ONLY snap to the grip points on the weapon.  I'm so sick of going for the grip and then snapping to a magazine.  Except the silenced pistol.  It is impossible to pull the magazine without smashing controllers together.

Having played all the pancake/flatscreen Sniper Elite games, Sniper Elite VR is a fraction of a shadow of the original game.  Those of us familar with the franchise expected that game in VR.  Instead, what we got was a mini-game.",Jul 11 at 10:08 AM,2, 5,"Hi there! A huge thank you for playing Sniper Elite VR and for taking the time to feedback your experiences and suggestions to us. We're currently investigating the issue where the VR hands are offset from the player's actual hands. This issue is currently being tested by QA and we hope to have a fix in the near future. I will pass on all of your other thoughts to the Development team, thank you!"
2022-05-28 17:49:05.961931,Kunakai,Based on limited experience,"This game feels like it's trying to achieve minimum viable product status.

The Sniper Elite trademark x-ray action cam feels like an interruption to the overall experience. 

Levels feel short, the first is maybe five minutes long (you move about 50 meters from start to finish). 

I haven't experienced the hand diviation issue many mention. 

The constant narration of the soldier speaking in past tense is annoying to say the least. Every other action you perform is followed by the actor telling you what he did next which can't be disabled. 

Interaction is limited to weapons and such, most of which is implemented in ways which lack the kind of tactility you'd expect from a such a high profile studio. 

Don't get me wrong, this isn't the worst of the worst but it feels like the developers are far from deserving of the five star ratings many have left. Once again I'm left wondering how a title has reviewed so well on Oculus but so badly on Steam. I can only conclude Oculus users either have far lower standards or that Facebook actively weigh scores in favour of a title (given how often this occurs I'm inclined to believe the latter).",Jul 10 at 3:42 AM,2, 4,"Hey there, we're always open to suggestions and any issues we hope to address as quickly as possible."
2022-05-28 17:49:09.071613,Daunte_Meme,An awesome experience with some flaws,"First off id like to say this is truely a great game and really everything I could have ever hoped for, that being said something feel awesome and others really miss the mark. First off the guns, the scopes are great feeling and focusing feels natural like i just unlocked a new enhanced sense. The problem lies with the handling. Racking the bolt should have a different command then placing your hand on the trigger. Reloading feels weightless and unsatisfying for snipers other guns feel great though. And for my biggest problem with the guns is the offhand mechanics, I use a gunstock and its great but the off hand basically makes the gun stay in this weird locked state the makes it impossible to aim down the sights with a stock. I know that stocks were not accounted for but its just so frustrating to have to readjust my gun just so i can take another step. Some other quality of life things id love to see added is the gore from the kill cam translated to the enemy models more, I dont wanna blast a dudes eyeballs out and splatter his brains just for his player model to look like he's sad and stargazing. Overall this is an experience that id reccomend with some slight caution its not dissapointing but its a often clunky well rounded game that shows a promising future for vr. P.S please expand on your characters i dont wanna hear ""hey look its my friend and vital part of the resitance dante!"" and then see him blown up two seconds later theres no impact to the death.",Jul 10 at 4:16 PM,4, 3,
2022-05-28 17:49:09.087571,Hunggy816,Needs a lot of polishing.,"I've streamed the game last night with about a 1100 viewers with me.
So far I've only finished the first 3 missions, so take that into consideration.
First off, the pros:
- Sniper Elite in VR, what more to say?
- Kill cam is more satisfying than watching on a flat screen
- Guns sound is amazing
that's about it for now.

Cons:
- Kill Cam is amazing, but gets annoying very quick, have to switch it off or turn down the frequency
- Hand animation is janky, when reloading the gun
- picking stuffs up sometimes can get really frustrating
- sound is off, enemies is to my left, but you hear them on your right (no i didn't have my left/right sound channel wrong, even my viewers heard the same)
- enemy AI is rather stupid
- physically crouching wouldn't put you into stealth

After experiencing Medal of Honor VR, I had high hopes for Sniper Elite VR
but so far the experience isn't perfect, if developer can fix some of the issues quick, this can be a 5-stars game.",Jul 10 at 4:12 PM,3, 3,We are addressing a number of issues as a result of player feedback. We appreciate your patience.

As soon as I went into the game I realized that it wasn't going to be nearly as good as I'd hoped. The bullets don't go where they're supposed to, it can be very difficult to aim pistols, and sometimes I will shoot enemies from about 2 feet away from them and it won't even register I hit them. Also whenever you die there is a screen with load last checkpoint and restart, clicking restart makes you restart the entire mission, and it really sucks when you accidentally click that and have to do everything over again. Besides all that I somewhat enjoy the game, when bullets go where I want them to it is fun to snipe. The story is alright, but there are definantly some mechanics and bugs that really make the game less fun.",Aug 2 at 11:47 AM,2, 0,The team have resolved a number of issues which we hope will improve your experience.

However, The controls are unbearable. It feels pretty clunky, You pull the scope up close to your face, for the scope to pop up and it takes 2 or so seconds before you can see through it. It doesnt seem to work with vr gun stocks, as sometimes you can see down the scope other times it was not lined up anymore. Being that its a sniping game it is almost requied to use a stock. When squatting you or steping a bit to one side (in to an object or wall) your screen blacks out with a message saying you are out of bounds. In which time you can still be killed. If they fix these things on this game, it will be one of the best in the store right now.

I have a 7700k and 1070sc I'm able to play @ high settings with no issues at all not 1 frame stutter so far, I think im about half way through the game. I remember EA's WWII shooter was so horrible even when I edited the ini file to the lowest setting it was stutter city. I will say some of the guns felt better in EA's title compared to this game. The guns and shooting feel a bit strange I can't put my finger on it but turn the hud off after you learn how to play or you will constanly see the controllers pop up as you reload or go to grab items.
