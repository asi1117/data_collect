2022-05-28 21:01:04.283562,Nemo_O,Level 6 Nightpatrol - WTF,"The levels prior to this were survivable - but this level, the shield doesn't work, enemies pop up (directly behind you) constantly, you drift through walls and fall out fo sync with your  guide ( the other team members are totally useless) - and you really can't play this seated. Have tried many times but have only made it to about 66% of the way - then you have to go back through to the beginning (laborious) sniper stage again, and again. Sorry but at this point im uninstalling...","Nov 30, 2020 at 8:08 PM",3, 2,"Step 6 is very easy once you understand its method.
You can find tips and help in our social networks.
For example, you are only moving only when you are looking on your teammate, if you didn't killed all enemies - don't look at your teammate because you will keep moving and more enemies will appear."

Tons of fun!,"The game is really good, the use of weapons and the mobility is amazing, Fun AF, and plus really immersive, i know a lot of people will say crap about the graphics and what not but this game is totally something you want in your library. 10/10 would recommend since they are also updating and adding stuff to the game. keep up the amazing work","Oct 9, 2020 at 6:39 AM",5, 19,
2022-05-28 21:01:04.312484,IAmDemitri,Arcade like and Fun,"It is very enjoyable. Don't mind the graphics at all. Makes the experience very comfortable. It's a fun game. But only problem I got is that some of the equipment does not work properly. Like the riot shield does not cover you from damage when standing behind it. It actually attracts more damage. The guns are cool, reload is just a touch of a button. But if possible maybe make an option to do a full immersive reload like in other shooter game. Example: reload a pistol buy grabbing a magazine from your chest or side and do a full reload and cocking the gun. I understand this is still in development so hoping to see more weapons and immersion. Game shows a lot of promise would recommend it.","Oct 9, 2020 at 10:38 PM",4, 18,
2022-05-28 21:01:04.327444,Cajin,Needs some work,"I had some fun in the beginning levels. The characters have funny gestures, and the missions were straight forward. Once you get to level 5 the enemies start popping up all around you; like Abracadabra here I am. The soldiers that are with you do not help at all and block your view and if you shoot them the mission is failed. The game is free, but has its frustrations from laggy, won't load up, to hitting invisible walls. It is a fun arcade shooter when it works and it's free.","Oct 13, 2020 at 12:31 AM",4, 7,"Step 6 is very easy once you understand its method.

2022-05-28 21:01:07.449095,ArgetH,5 Stars because its free,"The weapons handle as good as in any other shooter. the graphic style adds to the 3d depth effect. The music wakes up the good old playstation times and its just plug and play accesible. Handicap level is above average and it is a solid aim training. Whats else to say, it is by no means comparible with tripple a titles but it is comparible to arcade games of the late 80s and this it does fantastic.","Oct 13, 2020 at 1:42 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 21:01:07.464055,Rebel-YT,Fun and challenging game!,"Wasn't sure what to expect from this game but I found it to be fun and challenging at the same time. You are faced with a horde of enemies appearing and shooting at you, you can duck and move to avoid the bullets. Reloading is simple by ejecting the spent ammo and tapping on your chest to refill quickly.

The graphics are not top shelf but the game is colourful with clear graphics. 

If you are looking for a game that doesn's take itself too seriously but challenging at the same time, then go get yourself this game.

I have a video up on YouTube if you want to see the game in play at youtube.com/rebel rising.","Oct 27, 2020 at 1:43 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 21:01:07.491980,DerpHunter,great,The graphics are great this game is great the guns feel good and responsive my only complainnt is that i wish you could reload with a clip instead of pressing a button,"Oct 21, 2020 at 3:39 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 21:01:07.506940,CavemanAGz,Really fun,"I was hesitent at first but, dl'ed and it is great. Lot of  fun. Needs some polish, but worth the price by a lot.","Oct 16, 2020 at 12:19 PM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 21:01:10.631583,Zebded,Great Game and a Dev that cares,"An easy to access VR arcade type shooter.
I had this on the free Demo and followed the Dev on Facebook, they kept the site up to date and asked for testers at each stage to gauge reaction.
When released it took me some time to get round to playing but know I have the game is an aboslute blast, its easy to get into and hard to complete with many a frustrating  'nearly completed' moment on some levels.  At the time of writing I have just come from a full 360 fire fight and dripping with sweat. (Lovely image).
At the price its definitley one for the Library along with Pirate Trainer and Beat Saber to showcase VR to your friends (Eventually)","Oct 25, 2020 at 7:37 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 21:01:10.646543,BigRed1Juan,Fantastic Arcade Shooter,Absolutely one of the most fun arcade shooters on vr. The action is nonstop and the art work and climate is fun and entertaining. This is a must have game in your headset for parties and social gatherings. Definitely a home run title.,"Oct 22, 2020 at 11:58 AM",5, 1,
