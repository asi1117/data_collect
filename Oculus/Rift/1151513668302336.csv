Amazing tutorial that shows everything from timelines and statistics to science and astronomy. This is a great program that will keep adults and kids busy for a while. We can never know enough!","May 15, 2020 at 10:21 AM",5, 5,

The interface is generally very responsive. I was impressed by the number of lessons included in this version - I actually learned a few new things! This definitely shows the potential of this type of immersive 3D learning.

A minor bit of feedback: the labels sometimes float off out of view. I appreciate that the developers want them to automatically find the best place to see them but this may need tweaking. Also, there are certain objects that probably should not be grabbable (i.e. the solar system plane in the Horizon module, it quickly causes discomfort when you grab your entire horizon plane). Other than that, great job!","Feb 7, 2019 at 11:07 PM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 18:08:35.723238,RuneSR2,Nice concept,"It's a nice idea explaining how things work in VR and providing examples you can interact with in VR. Touch controls work fine and I get solid 90 fps using ss 2.0 on a GTX 1080. Personally I'd love to pay for this app, if the devs provided better models and textures. Textures are quite low res and the level of on screen polys is also quite low. It doesn't feel like a Rift app, maybe more for phone-VR like Go or GearVR. Sound is poor too, no voice over, just piano music. I know this is a free app and only 67 MB, again improve the video and Sound quality significantly and I'd rate the experience much higher and love to pay for it. Due to the low 67MB download I guess you're loading model online - feels very slow, loading times quite long and annoying.","Mar 28, 2019 at 6:38 AM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 18:08:35.737201,CYBL4DE,Like a walk in science park,"Very nice way how to explain how things work. You have your time to get why certain things do what they do.

I especially appreciated right ammount of text. Not too long, but still containing enough information.

I hope there will be possibility to add new things, because I believe community may be really helpfull with wide range of knowledge. Like VR Wikipedia","Mar 8, 2019 at 8:09 PM",5, 1,
