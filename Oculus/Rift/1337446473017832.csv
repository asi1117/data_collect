2022-05-28 19:40:58.334752,jeremik100,this game is awesome,"I bought this game yesterday and it's really cool. It reminds me of that phone game that was almost the same but was in 2D. all I miss in this game are fire threads, some kind of indestructible wall, bigger boxes and tools to interact with sand and stuff. But i don't know why steam version have more things on palette (ant and lava(i think) ) if its possible i  have a request, can someone add this?. (sorry if I wrote it wrong but I'm from another country and I translated it from the google translator because my English is very poor) but by suggesting this, this game is really very cool |edit: I hope the person who created this game will see this comment","Feb 2, 2021 at 10:13 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:40:58.348714,Imingater496,Fine,It is quite a interesting app I indeed love it I would give it 5 stars if it wasn’t $5 it is worth more like $3 but besides that I recommend this alot,"Jun 30, 2019 at 11:33 PM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 19:40:58.363674,Axolotl-Burndown,potential.,"This game, right now, isnt worth 5 bucks, maybe more like $1. It works, it runs well, and does what it says it does. It just lacks content. Ive put MANY hours into sand simulators, but only because there was more stuff. If they were just to expand upon this, i would happily pay more money.","Feb 27, 2019 at 4:04 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 19:40:58.377637,TechKno,Functional,"Despite all the other reviews, I decided to purchase this for myself after reminiscing spending hundreds of hours playing Falling Sand games as a child. 
I can safely say for me atleast, the simulator works. 
The functionality of this is very limited though. The layout is trying to copy all the other creative apps like Quill and Tilt Brush however due to the very simplistic graphics chosing items and knowing exactly what they do are a bit hard as they are all unlabled. You have 4 brush sizes and 8 diferent elements. You have Plant, Water, Fire, Rock, Fuse, Gunpowder and two different coloured sands (well atleast that's how I interpret it). In order to place any itemsyou use the A button on the touch controllers which is counter-intuitive as all other apps of this sort that I've tried use the triggers. 

There are two different modes, one where you have a small cube, the other is the same cube, only much larger and the contrrol scheme for movement has completely changed. You use the triggers to change your elevation and use the left joystick to control all other movement. 

This is a good first start to reviving a game from my childhood into 2018. 
I just hope the developer is active and looking to improve this with more content and to make it a little more user-friendly.","Sep 16, 2018 at 9:14 PM",3, 4,

This can also occur if you are trying run software while being logged in on Oculus home into an account that is different than the one that you bought this app in. 

I contacted Oculus and they confirmed that the entitlement checks are working properly for VR Sand, and neither I or Oculus are able to reproduce your issue. Could you try running it again? Make sure you are logged into the account you purchased it from.
