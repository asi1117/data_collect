2022-05-28 20:29:39.382701,RuneSR2,Awesome experience,"Graphics are like no other app - simply beautiful. I wasn't aware the Rift CV1 could master such great graphics, but it could - even using super sampling 2.0 I got solid 90 fps in this app (using a GTX 1080). Remember to increase super sampling for example using Oculus Tray Tool as much as possible - to make this unique app shine the most.
You're immediately immersed in the story, and can solve riddles, throw hedgehogs and more. $5 is more than a fair price for this app. Touch is supported, risk of nausea is very low. This app may be a nice way to introduce other persons to VR.","Mar 15, 2021 at 12:34 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:29:39.397661,Kattatonia,Too short to pay for,"I was shocked when this ""game"" took me about 15 minutes to complete. The graphics (although more like drawings than realistic) were neat and the riddles were interesting, but I would not recommend this 15 minute experience for a $5 pricetag.","Mar 27, 2021 at 9:36 AM",2, 4,
