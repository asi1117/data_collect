2022-05-28 20:58:26.825705,LakeTree,Good game but a bit pricy,"This game has a great story line, with good mechanics and only a few minor glitches. My only problem with this game is the amout of value that I got out of it. Sure, you might replay it once or twice just for fun but the story length is really not that long. I was able to beat the entire game in about a day and a half, and that might just be me, but even if you play games at a slow pace , this will probably give you 4 days of entertainment at most. There is also no extra things that you could play, like in the first game, there is only the story mode and thats it. That being said, it still is able to deliver on some very sinematic moment, along with good humor, improved maps, and interesting new mechanics / enemies. Yet, I still think that it just falls short of what the first game was, and that it dose not deserve to have that $30 price tag, but something around $10. If you have $30 floting around and you are looking at this game, I would highly recomend that you buy something like Boneworks if you have not yet done so. If you are very invested in the story, and just have to find out what happens, then go ahead, but I am just warning future buyers that they should probably put this on a wishlist and wait untill it goes on sail because it's just too pricy for what you get.","Mar 30, 2021 at 8:33 AM",3, 5,
2022-05-28 20:58:26.839668,Yobiwan29,Fantastic game with technical issues,Some audio hiccups and frame dropping on Quest 2 and a very good rig. I can't play it anymore.,"Jan 30, 2021 at 11:34 AM",3, 7,
2022-05-28 20:58:26.853631,G4mb10r,"Good, with minor issues","So, they fixed most of the issues folks had with the first game, making the environments more interesting and adding the bow and ability to knockout robots. At the same time, the story was less compelling. They didn't really add on from the first. The fight with Adam is still annoying, but in a different way. Also, side note, don't eat all of the tacos. There is a level where you need one to progress and if you thought it would be funny to eat all of the tacos in a level, you will find yourself stuck and having to reload the whole thing and start over. Grrr... that being said, Budget Cuts is a classic for a reason. The physics are great. The stealth and knife throwing are a blast. The robots are funny. It's still a very nice game overall and worth playing.","Dec 3, 2020 at 5:37 AM",4, 15,

2022-05-28 20:58:29.961318,Stoneking,didn't capture what make the first good,"now ok, the first is amazing its one of if not the best steath game ever made for 
vr. but this one not so much, the thing is it doesn't focus on steath, more just run in head first and attacking. you cant control how slow or fast you teleport so you make a lot of noise, the game also leaves a lot open and I usaully like this but I point I didn't know what to do and there was no tell me, now I don't want arrows point to the exit, but come on, when it take a person 3 days to figure out one thing that not a good sign. also you died in one hit in the first one I was ok because you need to be steathy but here you will died again, and again, and again. 

but now for the parts the game is good with fighting, and (spoilar allert) destorying adam was fine if not annoying. and it look amazing. 

the game is more of a chore to me but I was ok If you want to see the game for you self then go ahead but to me it was to much to quick.","Jul 2, 2020 at 4:09 PM",2, 5,

2022-05-28 20:58:29.997222,SansTheWise,Pretty good!,"Not a bad game, slight optimization issue tho causing low fps in some locations but its still very playable. I enjoy the immersion and the stealth aspect is enjoyable. It is hard to evade the robots when they find you, scary at times. But over all a decent game.","May 1, 2020 at 5:01 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 20:58:30.012182,ParadiseDecay,A lot more polished!,"My Initial Thoughts
The first Budget Cuts was a huge hit back in the day with its unique teleportation style and assassin style gameplay.
All lessons learned from the first game have been improved upon to bring us another glorious romp in this robot murdering adventure.

2022-05-28 20:58:30.026145,Rockneee,play now,so it is just like the first one but better situations,"Mar 9, 2020 at 6:04 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 20:58:33.103913,Masamune5454,missed the mark,"the first budget cuts was fanstic. all around special game. i expected this one to greatly improve upon what made the first strong, but instead it just makes the same mistakes over and doesnt really add anything new. the bow is the only new thing ive seen, and its not that good. its fun, but with the translocator (which at the time was cool, but now that all the games i play are smooth locomotion, it feels very wierd and akward at best.) so to move you have to put the bow away, teleport then pull the bow out and open inventory and slot a arrow then aim and not die all withing a small margin. this wouldnt be as bad, but stealth has taken a backseat to many enemys and unavoidable fights.
then the old pitfalls are back. one of the things i hated the most was looking through every dammed cabinet, only to find nothing but a scrap of paper. instead items are sitting on desk or lodge in random targets that shouldnt exist becuase who else is using this bow? so there is no real reward for exploration and looking in the shelfs and drawers, which to me was a big let down. that would have been half the fun is searching for office supplies in.... offices. also its too similiar to the first game. theres no new Quality of life features and no new options or things to do in general. the scenery looks cool a quirky, but you soon discover that other than eating for no reason like in the first one, there just isnt a good reason to stay around in one area, nothing engaging from section to section other than fight. also the bow makes using knife throwing a lot less viable. i think the bow should have a shot limit especially since it is silenced. maybe some battery cells to recharge the bow would be nice, as to not just fling arrows, at this point im more interested in Garden of the Sea","Jan 3, 2020 at 5:41 PM",3, 14,
2022-05-28 20:58:33.119870,SandMaster314,FUN,Ok Budget Cuts 2 is already my favorite game here are some things I did.

2022-05-28 20:58:33.133833,Manydoors,Strange game.,"A very awkward and frustrating game to play.  Okay graphics and sound but the game-play is a little meh.  The idea is to hide and use stealth to combat the robots but they always seem to know where you are.  They run to your location and gun you down before you can open your menu for a weapon.  Hide behind something they home in on you.  Sneak and they hear you.
Your up against killer robots with  nothing but a bow that shoots everything but robots along with a assortment of household items.  The whole thing is a exercise in futility.
I have not played Budget cuts one so I can't do a comparison, but Budget cuts 2 has a zero rating in entertainment, unless you find entertainment in getting killed over and over.","Mar 1, 2020 at 4:29 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 20:58:33.148793,Teh_Succulent,Same foundation. Different execution,"To start off, Budget Cuts 2 feels far too similar to the original game to be called a proper sequel, as much of the HUD, music, and general mechanics have been left alone. This would be okay, but when you factor in the playtime of about 5 hours maximum, it seems like this game should be cheaper than it is. I would like to clarify though, that for every negative about this game, there is a positive. Though Budget Cuts 2 doesn't build on the original very much, the original was still good. The issue is that the places where the sequel tries to add need support in other ways, mechanical or sometimes technical. To start off, Budget Cuts 2 builds more on the universe of the world, as any good sequel should do, and the game does this well. Another thing that a sequel does is raise the stakes, and Budget Cuts 2 does this also. The issue here is that the stakes have been raised by adding new environments. The environments themselves are certainly not the issue, it was incredibly nice to get to play on rooftops or in a factory, but when these new places are connected by just more buildings that all look the same as the one the first place took place in, things start to blend together. Another problem that comes from the new environments is that the larger expanses show the fairly low graphical power that the game has. I said earlier that the game does not build on the primary mechanics very much. The game has changed a few key things, which I think distance it from what the original was. The puzzle solving and stealth are still amazing, but the stealth harly exists. Because of things like the ability to quietly or quickly moving through portals and the bow and arrow, the need for stealth drops off quite dramatically. Now instead of offices with cubicles full of patrolling security gaurds and back doors or vents for the player to hide in, you have cubicles with an upper balcony with 5 - 6 security gaurds, to simply shoot at. Budget Cuts 2 is primarily an action game.","Dec 22, 2019 at 3:19 AM",3, 6,
