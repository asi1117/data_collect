2022-05-28 20:06:50.475693,VibrationsOfDoom,Fun and somewhat of a workout...,"I enjoyed this game... The space scenes are beautiful. Would that I had more room to move around. Not too crazy about the rail gun aspect of this, but it adds another element to keep things from being boring... I do enjoy the swinging light sabers at moving objects however... Got through a few levels and am curious to see where the rest of this game takes me...","May 18, 2021 at 11:17 AM",4, 1,
