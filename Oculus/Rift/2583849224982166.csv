The sound is really someting else, you can actually hear from what direction the bananas are coming. It not just ""left"" or ""right"" as in stereo, it's really spatial and immersive. The game is quite simple, I will definitely try it with some friends.","Aug 3, 2019 at 8:43 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:31:01.734558,ParadiseDecay,"Standard, bland wave shooter!","*I have added an additional Star to my review! - I played the game for my video review using just 1 ear bud (so I can hear myself talk), apparently the game relies on sound to play. So I have added an extra star for the benefit of the doubt.

My initial impressions:
Graphics are nice and the weapon handling feels great but this ends up being just another standard wave shooter that lacks innovation and game logic.
The game features just an endless onslaught of banana's with no real progression, variety, or wave's to help break up the monotony.
The game has a novel and unique theme for the 1st 10 mins but becomes rather bland very quickly.
To be honest I was expecting just a Space Invaders clone, which would have been cool, but that wasn't the case.... it's just random banana's being throw at you.
The game does have a power-up system, but no notifications what the power-up's do? and also the main menu was broken for me.
ALSO Developers please add Tutorials!","Aug 3, 2019 at 12:17 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 19:31:01.749518,Atoner,Bananas for pea-shooters?  U'd better be,"An interesting game, and I get the going for audio detection because - to be honest - I could hardly see the bananas at all until they were right in my face.  By then it's too late to pip the one you didn't realise was behind and above you at the same time.  Audio location is fine for bats, but it don't help me.  Once there's more than two incoming bananas it's just a mish mash of stereo whirlwind.  VR is confusing, and vast, and to lose almost half of it in an audio palette of clutter is a shame to an otherwise intriguing concept.
Maybe make the targets flash red once every two or three seconds when they're far away, getting quicker as they get nearer?  That way I'd stand half a chance of being able to see them.
It's got great potential, but needs a bit of tweaking in my opinion.  Interested to see how this game develops in updates.  Pricetag is awesome 3.99 - I'll keep it and contribute to further development by all means.
Perhaps this is geared towards Quest users because it's also very easy to get yourself wrapped in your cord.","Aug 4, 2019 at 9:44 AM",3, 2,

It seems to be perfect for an evening with firends, trying to outscore the others, just having fun! I hope it will have more variety in next releases though.","Aug 3, 2019 at 6:36 PM",5, 5,
