2022-05-28 18:23:47.050763,FastLawyer,VR y Mediocre Christmas music videos,"I wanted to like this app.  After all, it's in the Christmas spirit and it's free.  I can definitely appreciate the effort that went into this production.  Lady Gaga's performance of Edge of Glory is amazing and Mary J. Blige's performance of The Christmas song is soulful.  But the visuals are too expressionistic and uneven across the different songs.  For example, look at the children's faces depicted during Mary J. Blige's performance, it actually looks so expressionistic that it feels like a Halloween special instead of putting you in the Christmas spirit.  Also, the images are sewn together, but they seem randomly thrown in together.  The depictions are all over the place and don't ever mesh with the song.  You never know exactly where to look or what you're supposed to see or even what to feel.  The polar bear scenes were good.   But other than that, the visuals were mediocre at best and it was only the audio experience that resonated.  Also, the image scales were  completely off most of the time and the app had errors such as the focal points suddenly going behind you and then up and then below you.  Gaze to make selections in that scenario is not a good thing.  Oh well, they tried.   But this is not anything I'll be showing off to friends or family.  Merry Christmas.","Dec 29, 2017 at 1:35 PM",3, 16,
2022-05-28 18:23:47.066721,nightcat.mau,"Beautiful, Scary, Sad, Strange","It is a beautiful experienmce at points, but beauty is very subjective. Santa Claus looks, well, if they ever fimd the bodies, I won't be surpised. He drowns at one point, death and some techo rave bunny or elf girls show up, and that's the normal part. It felt bleak and lonely in parts, like life had no meaning. And then they either live happily ever after or die, that ending is really vauge. Five stars for the ton of work obviously put into it, but the music, while fantastic feels really random. It also seemed a bit messed with, like it was ran through an effect program. There is a strange air of horror in it like a previous reviewer said, I kept expecting something to go wrong and in the scene in the Christmas house I swear I spotted Slenderman.","Dec 30, 2017 at 6:18 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:23:47.080683,pigtripper,,"Nice music, some pretty pictures, but OMG, did no one teach these people one of the cardinal rules of VR?  You automatically move through each scene which would be fine if they didn't keep changing the speed and acceleration.  Vomit-inducing.  Also, the music played so softly during the animation sequence that I could barely hear it, although it was fine on the menu selection.","Dec 31, 2017 at 4:07 AM",2, 2,
