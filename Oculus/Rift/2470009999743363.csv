2022-05-28 20:47:52.230021,vanphananim,The Key shows the potential to VR,I absolutely love this experience.    The first time I saw it was at OC6 and it blew me away.   My second time seeing it at home is just as good and works great even without the actor.   I hope more content like this get made and supported.  Projects like the Key shows VR’s potential and will help bring  more people into the platform.,"Apr 17, 2020 at 5:54 AM",5, 34,
2022-05-28 20:47:52.243984,EddieNanakase,I highly encourage people to download !,"It's great to see works like this once in a while.  It changes your perspective for the better, especially in times like these, in where we are constantly running through life and don't notice, we don't pay attention to the things that are truly important.  It has fantastic voice acting !  Very interesting visuals that catch your curiosity, your mind, as you try to figure out what is going on.  You feel like you might have figured out where this is going, but it surprises you.   This experience delivers a very powerful message, and it delivers it very well !","May 13, 2020 at 11:38 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:47:52.258944,cozmon3c,"Cool Beginning, Dumb Ending","It was much better in the dream world, even if it was hard to follow, still fun because it was odd. They should have just stayed there, moving the story to refugees was, well, just bad story telling. Little floating ball friends, not sure how they relate. Is it a political statement thing?, not sure, but all I see with refugees is what happens when good people do nothing, evil prevails. That is what the true message should have been. People standing in line, not taking action, I don't have much sympathy for that, and I know that is what they were trying to do. The music was excellent, the art was good, but the story went from alright to wow, how is this connected.","May 3, 2020 at 8:31 AM",2, 3,

2022-05-28 20:47:52.287867,Satconcook,Artistic way to show real life feelings,"It is a nice way to tell a story and in the end kind of brings it all together. It has some minor interactions, but for the most part you just sit and watch the animated action around you. I wouldn’t say it is fully political because war ravaged areas forcing refugees to seek shelter is a real thing. While so many that have never been out of their sheltered life have no idea what it is like. This is more of an artistic way of explaining the feelings of it rather than graphic detail, but touching.","May 21, 2020 at 11:43 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 20:47:55.417496,TeacherAuthor,Not worth the price,"Yes, it is FREE - and STILL not worth the price. It has a weird storyline ... made even worse when you learn that is simply a political statement. It would have been lame even without the ending ... the finale made it worse.","May 3, 2020 at 5:50 AM",1, 6,

2022-05-28 20:47:55.446419,shoveler,Better than the reviews indicate,"The Key is a beautiful and moving experience. I have to think those that are disparaging this as something that is simply ""pushing a political agenda"" are bored children or folks who just expected a game, though it's clearly not advertised as such.","May 2, 2020 at 12:23 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:47:55.461379,IbegU2Rift,Sentimental garbage,"For a long time i thought, why has this won anything ??? and waiting and waiting for something special. Bad grafics, bad controls.

2022-05-28 20:47:58.568069,zamorev,"crazy, nothing works in vr","such a serious topic could be made very interesting, it was first necessary to show the house, then its destruction, then the memories and not such a crazy characters. Complete nonsense. Sorry.","Apr 29, 2020 at 8:08 PM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 20:47:58.583029,Dillon2345,Not what I I initially expected,"This experience was amazeing for me non the less, the graphics were amazeing and I love the story built into the game. The only thing I have to complain about this is that it is pretty short, this VR experience is like nothing I've ever seen before and we need content like this in the future.","Apr 22, 2020 at 3:45 AM",5, 2,

Can't say much about it...it's not a ""game"" just interesting perspective, arts'y. Worth a quick experience. 3 and a half stars is what i would give it if i could, but since it's a other side of the looking glass perspective i'll give it 4 instead of 3.","Jun 5, 2020 at 8:52 PM",4, 0,
