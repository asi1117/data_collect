2022-05-28 20:28:11.051278,Jaxmonster13,good game poor performence,"the game right of the bat is not the most visualy appeling vr game ive played. the weapons seem to be correctly weighted, swords are not really heavy. the players health seems to me a 2 shot and your dead. even with the best armor I still died in 2 hits. and the opponents seem to miss a lot of there swings. the opponents dont die if i stab them mutiple times in the side and chest. the game needs to be polished more.",7 days ago,3, 0,
2022-05-28 20:28:11.066238,JacobtheCorbett,Satisfying,"The mechanics of the game feel very satisfying and very life like, whenever I completely parry someone's attack i feel like im dueling in GOT.


Also fix the maces, im tired of getting a good hit in just to see their body bend awkwardly and then take no damage.",Nov 2 at 7:32 AM,4, 19,

2022-05-28 20:28:11.097155,Arakinas,"I loved the arena, until the boss fights","I think there might be a mode other than arena, but I've only been playing the arena. There was a bit of a learning curve for me to figure out the flow of some of the fights, but I've had a lot of fun playing with it. Until I got to my first boss fight.  Prior to this, it was a relatively decent (not good or great mind you) sword fighting game. And then some idiotic weirdness with magic came into play. The first boss I ran into, on the samurai side had weird death pools that spawned occassionally. Another one was mostly normal, and then just automagically healed itself all the way back up when it was nearly dead. None of the rest of the game is like this and it was a huge let down. I expected something stronger, faster, smarter that was along the same lines as the rest of the game. Not a left turn from quasi historical to fantasy.",Sep 6 at 5:47 AM,2, 6,"Hello Arakinas, I'm happy to hear you had fun with most of the game! The lore, particularly when dealing with the boss fights, is based on some elements of Norse mythology. The villain (final boss) is a Jötunn and the normal bosses you fight are as powerful as they are because of the magical weapons he gave them.

I can see that having more mystical / magical elements isn't going to be for everyone, but fighting the bosses is not a requirement of any kind unless you specifically want to unlock their magical weapons.

The one that heals himself in particular can be challenging — whenever you see him enter that healing phase, all you have to do is damage him in any way to interrupt him. If you leave him be, he will eventually regain all of his HP.

If you have ideas on how we can improve the parts of the game you did enjoy (the normal combat), we're ready to hear it. Feel free to each out any time on Discord (https://discord.com/invite/sinnstudio) or by email directly: sinn@sinnstudio.com"
2022-05-28 20:28:11.113112,tattedtrex,Absolutely love it,The only downside I see is the lack of dlc but I’m sure that will change very soon. Good work guys keep at it!!!,Oct 16 at 6:48 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:28:14.229876,deadtoall23,game physics arent worth the money,"i have been playing this game for  a few hours now and the physics are trash. not only to you OFTEN get 1 shot by EASY enemies, some of their attacks are unblockable, sometimes they are un-hittable and 30% or so of the time your sword will just bounce right off of them. DO NOT BUY.",Aug 26 at 9:23 PM,1, 2,"Hey deadtoall23, appreciate the feedback! We're working on a big weapons overhaul right now for the next update and an animation overhaul for the update after that. These two together will greatly improve the things you've mentioned. 

If you have more feedback or suggestions, we're always around to chat on Discord (https://discord.com/invite/sinnstudio) or you can email me directly at sinn@sinnstudio.com"
2022-05-28 20:28:14.245834,Baconarmada,This game has potential,"While fun at first, it got very frustrating when I realized how bad the hit detection was. I thought I was missing them, or that the armor was blocking my hits, but no. So many of my attacks (like stabs at the face) were ""dodged"" by the enemies rubbernecking around my sword, or when my swings would clearly connect, they never register. Game has potential, fix the issues.","Jun 2, 2021 at 2:53 PM",2, 12,"Hey Baconarmada, this can certainly happen and we're working hard as we speak to address this problem. Our upcoming update is a big weapons overhaul (advanced weapon handling to allow you to freely grip weapons however you want without restriction) that also includes a lot of physics and hit detection improvements.

I hope you'll get a chance to try it, and thanks for your feedback!"
2022-05-28 20:28:14.263292,KhadaFenris,If you like sword fighting VR get this,"Its fairly new so the physics are sometimes whacky (enemies getting stuck in eachother for a moment, player sword getting stuck inside of bodies when lunging in and out making it difficult to have SUPER fluid realistic gameplay. Im very certain these developers want more for this game and in the near future it will be perfected to become a great game worth well over what it costs now","Jun 3, 2021 at 5:02 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:28:14.278253,PickleRicksPickle,Definitely worth a go!,"So I bought this expecting it to be a lesser game to blade and sorcery. I was nicely surprised as it has a very nicely polished feel to it. 
I gave it stars but I think there is room for improvement on some of the mechanics. For me the decapitation feels a bit random, sometimes hacking away at the neck yields nothing whereas other times the head goes flying after a neck stab. 

Only just defeated the knight boss, he seemed insanely and somewhat unrealistically hard to kill though.

I was hoping for more of a dungeon mode, but it’s actually still just varying levels of arena/wave modes that I’ve played so far. But I’m sure there is more to it as I explore the game.","May 3, 2021 at 1:50 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 20:28:14.293213,jgmckenzie,Just get it.,This game...so much fun. Challenging and open to how you want to fight; not to mention the amout of consideration that has been taken to ensure the physics actually accout for something. Different spawns every time you load a level make for a replay value that I haven't seen in a very long time. Not to mention that the wife is fighting me for who gets to play next makes for an added bonus that I can't rate with stars.,"Apr 3, 2021 at 5:31 PM",5, 38,
2022-05-28 20:28:17.400529,FiddleCasserole,pretty cool,"i love the action but it feels like its just rinse and repeat. Also there is a bug to where when you start, if you stab the enemy, their top half glitches around and puts your sword out of the map to which you just have to die and start over. overall, pretty fun, just need something other than fighting 1-3 at a time and basically doing it over again until the round ends for another go at the same stuff","May 27, 2021 at 9:03 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 20:28:17.418481,Figley4,OnSale!?,I have been anxious to play this and veryt excited. I saw that it was on sale a thought nows the time! but ive play though acouple rounds tried the arena and also the zombie mode.... Sweet concept could be amazing! but the sword play and the attacks are not there.. sword and sorcery has the right mechanics... I would not buy this game again if I knew what I know now...

2022-05-28 20:28:17.436433,Akira_McCloud,Fun and good work out!,"Fun game. Thank you. Been needing something a bit more polished than that ""other game"". A little buggy at times, but so much fun it make you forget about those bugs... Not for the easily frustrated.","Mar 31, 2021 at 11:28 AM",5, 14,
2022-05-28 20:28:17.451393,Ryan_VR3,Really fun,"It is a fun game and you should just get it, it is a very fun sword fighting sim with realistic fighting","Apr 10, 2021 at 2:27 AM",5, 9,

Please patch, I am unable to finish the game at this point","Apr 12, 2021 at 7:33 AM",4, 4,"Hey Whiteknight459, this bug has been fixed :) You can find a full list of patch notes and upcoming features on our roadmap, here: https://trello.com/b/nDGVDca9/swordsman-vr-roadmap"
