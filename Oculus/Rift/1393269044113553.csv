But here's the thing... Please edit how the amount an offset/ipd adjust for vr videos.

I would rather have volume on thumbstick up/down than zoom. How often do you use zoom when watching movie ? Way less often than volume :) Yet, zoom is default there and cannot be changed. Stupid decission but oh well. Hint hint : why so many people still use media player classic ? coz we can customize it to our liking.

2022-05-28 16:30:37.772621,TonyBrookT,Good App but Needs Improvement,"After purchasing an Oculus Quest, I ""mistakenly"" purchased SkyBox VR certified for use on my new Quest, and shortly afterwards had to purchase the Rift S certified version to use it via Quest Link. I also installed the free PC version of DeoVR for comparison.

The SkyBox VR Quest wireless certified version works as advertised, allowing me to play 4K videos on my PC, via both the standard Windows media streamer and via SkyBox's Airstream. Once I managed to get Quest Link working, the Rift S versions also worked as advertised, playing up to 5K. However, with Quest Link, I find the control interface on DeoVR somewhat better, and the DeoVR version of Windows Explorer is much better, for accessing listed hard-drives, folders and titles.

So Skybox VR does what it claims to do and does it well, but with room for improvement. I will leave Skybox to lobby Oculus about two issues: the need to market ""Quest Link"" certified apps (not just Quest wireless or Rift S compatible), and being clearer about cross-selling. I understand around 20 Oculus apps are cross-sold, but this is not publicised. Also, Skybox need to improve their product, if they wish to continue charging for it.","Sep 6, 2020 at 10:17 PM",5, 18,

2022-05-28 16:30:37.817501,mykgerard,,"I've used Skybox on the Rift and the Quest.  Up until recently it was my go to movie player for VR on both playtforms.  I really like the controls and the enviornments in the appand it hasn't had a problem playing back most of the different file types I've tried. 

Recently after adding an 8 TB hdd to my system I noticed issues with the Rift that the Quest doesn't seem to have as far as handling large capacity HDD's.  If I so much as click on a drive in the program's navigation on the Rift it will crash the Oculus program and freeze the HMD in one of those nauseating blurry crash frames with a PC popup window indicating a ""Oculus_SourceVRPlayer.exe has stopped working"" error.  I've noticed other Oculus rift video players also seem to have this same issue, so this seems like more of an oculus issue than a skybox issue.  Needless to say I  hope this is resolved because The Rift on my PC can play back larger movies with less hickups than the quest over the network.   In the meantime if you have this issue and a lot of time for moving files around you may wish to partition drives to be 2 tb or less.

However there are a few features that would be greatly appreciated if they were integrated into the video player. Such as:
MKV chapters - not a big deal but it'd be nice
default aspect ratio - every video defaults to 1:1 pixel ratio but there's the option to change to various aspect ratios manually. Respecting the default would be greatly appreciated, especially with full SBS 3D movies.
MKV default tracks - internal subtitles are on by default regardless of whether they are set as default tracks or not
new or custom theater scenes. There are only a few included. They are nice and serve their purpose well.

Also on the Gear VR (and Quest) version there seems to be an issue with thumbnails working or not working randomly. They work on PC so long as the .jpg file is the same name as the movie.
Text subtitles appear stretched if you change a movie's aspect ratio in the Quest version. This doesn't happen on the PC version.","Jun 8, 2020 at 4:04 PM",4, 8,

The sense of immersion of sitting in the cinema watching feature length films (or your own home videos) on a large screen has to be seen to be believed.  The quality of the environment and the video is amazing - especially with an Oculus Rift.  It truly feels like you are at the cinema!

If you use the right software to convert titles to 3D SBS (full) MKV files - in original bit rates and settings - the resultant 3D on Skybox is amazing (the first software I used said it converted in true 3D, but the result was minimal; so I needed to use a different program altogether for the conversion to MKV).  The resolution, color depth, audio, and overall quality is excellent and in high definition - and the 3D effect is unlike anything I've ever seen, even in a theatre.  It's even better than on my 3D TV, where the effect is very pronounced - with snowfall ""landing on my coffee table"" and amazing dimensional depth.  

A five-star piece of software, for sure!  This absolutely feels like I'm watching a 3D film in an actual theatre.","Jun 7, 2020 at 11:33 AM",5, 9,

The makers need to do a real-life user test:
- go to a torrent site
- download a load of movies in various formats, resolutions, some with ridiculous long filenames 
- browse to your ""downloads"" folder in the skybox file browser and figure out what's causing it to crash.

Lets face it, this is the #1 usecase for a majority of users of an app like this.  

Its probably an obscure format or a weird/long filename or weird metadata causing the crashes.

2022-05-28 16:30:59.940330,MongYee,Good Player but had to get it from Steam,"Great player but I could not finalize the installation in the Oculus library. Said was going to install third party software and then the installation failed. I went in the Oculus Redistributables folder and tried to install the third party software manually. Visual cpp 2015 vc redist 64 failed to install because another version of this product is already installed on my system, and other redistributable file also failed to install. In any case, I could start Skybox VR player by double clicking on its exe file in the install directory and it worked perfectly so I thought I would hide the app in my library and add manually a third party app by pointing directly to the exe - I did this trick and it worked with another app I had the same problem with, Blade Runner Memory Lab (the only other app I encountered this problem with). But in the case of Skybox, it didn't work because when I tried to start the app from the library after having added it manually, I got the message that I was not logged on to the Oculus Store and that I had to log on before starting the app. Since it is too awkward to have to go to the install folder to double click on the exe file every time I want to use Skybox, the only solution I could think of was to uninstall it and then install it from Steam instead. This works perfectly, I can now start Skybox from the Oculus library but it is not ideal because now, Steam VR opens up first, each time I start Skybox.  A SUGGESTION TO THE DEVELOPER - wouldn'it be possible to distribute your app without third party software - obviously all the software required is already available in Windows 10 since the app works anyway after failing to finalise its installation when you double click directly on its exe file ? Apart from that, the app is great. It plays pretty much everything, the only flaw I found is it wouldn't see PGS subs muxed into MKVs. Still, I recommend this app.","Dec 17, 2019 at 10:59 AM",4, 3,

Streaming via Plex works fine from both PC & Shield :)
Little basic in terms of what you can do with the screen etc. (e.g. make it larger/smaller, as you can do with YouTube) but it does the job
I feel that the screen curve option should be available in the screen options, rather than in advanced setting (doesn't make much sence to me where it is).

2022-05-28 16:31:03.070957,Elgsdyr,Very good but not without flaws,"Positives:
+ Nice, simple, and elegant interface.
+ Has a decent, basic set of controls for 3D video adjustment.
+ Support for many audio formats. Works: AC3, TrueHD, AAC, DTS, and DTS-HD MA has worked for me. Worksn't: Atmos (plays the TrueHD part).
+ A few nice visual environments to choose from (if that's your thing) and settings to adjust ambient light level (could be nice with finer increments, though).

Negatives (+bugs):
- VobSub subtitles don't work
- Audio track sync not fine enough. Should have +/- 10ms buttons as well.
- Displays (some?) internal subs double on the screen.
- No 3D (binaural) mapping of the multi-channel audio tracks. It's seems quite the contradiction to watch video in beautiful 3D while hearing 1-dimensional audio inside your head. And no, Windows Sonic for Headphones is not an option - it pretty much sucks (badly) in that regard. I think Oculus provides the libraries needed (as well as SteamVR) so it shouldn't be that hard to implement. (Someone even made a free 3D audio plug-in for positional audio in SkyrimVR, which works perfectly - in Skyrim...) Imagine having real 3D surround sound with just headphones while watching 3D movies...
- Forgets at every restart that I've turned off the ambient lighting. The slider is showing the correct value in the settings, but is still showing some ambient light. Adjusting it up and down fixes it, but it's annoying to have to do this for every restart.

Things I haven't tried (yet):
* 3D BluRays (ISO).
* Some audio formats: DTS:X (I'd expect it to play the DTS-HD MA part).","Nov 1, 2019 at 7:53 AM",4, 10,

This application runs 100% smooth, with minimal flicker and you can enjoy 3D movies without any problems. I use it for 3D movies and videos right now.
+Edit: The reason why this rating got 5 and not 4 star is very clear: The player saves your video settings for your individual movie file after exiting the movie. So for instance, this morning I played a low quality mp4 3D video which required 3D side-by-side and 180deg and a special setting: Monoscope under VR settings so that vision isn't blurry and instead made crystal clear. When opening this same file again, the settings remain.","Jun 8, 2018 at 3:13 PM",5, 2,

Plus, it gives basic information, like the length of the clip. The best part was discovering I could watch 3D movies in VR. For some reason, I was unaware you could watch 3D in the Oculus. That said, I'm not a huge fan of 3D at the cinema because it isn't very effective most of the time. It never really looks 3D to me, just kind of... odd. Only rarely does it look effective. Like, when Harry Potter killed Voldormort and there were bits floating in the air.  

My only complaint is a minor one. The player sometimes mistakes the format and starts the clip in the wrong mode. For example, it may play a regular clip in 180 degree format, or 360. Thankfully, it only takes a second to reset it to the correct format.

2022-05-28 16:32:38.114749,Piflyon,Nice app. With 4 demands....,"November 15, 2017 update :
- VERY nice, the DLNA works.
- Updates indicate that the tilt & scale has been added to the theater, but it is disabled and I don't know why.
- Update indicates that we can change the brigthness in the theater, but it only changes the picture's one, not the lights in the room.

Previous review :
Nice player, tried it for some minutes yet, but I there is some things (I think simple) to fix : 1- In theater/cinema mode, it looks like we are not sitting in the seat but standing up on it. 2 - There is too much light in the theater (as when we watch advertisements in a real one). This prevents me from watching a full movie, I feel wanting to shout ""Hey there ! Anybody could turn off the light please ?"". ;-) . 3 - I think this one can be tricky : Can you grant access to files placed on the local network ? (NAS). 4 - The tilt setting is unavailable in the theater, I'd like to use it to put the screen upper to watch movies in bed.
Anyway, thank you for the GREAT job.  The UI is very nice and handy. I did not try yet MKV files, but the description says ""ALL formats"" so I'm not worrying. :)","Nov 15, 2017 at 9:36 PM",4, 1,"Hi,  1. we have adjusted the height of the POV. 2. we have dimmed down the lighting a little, and we are considering allowing user to adjust theatre lighting. Try using the Void mode for now if it is still to bright. 3. We do support NAS via DLNA now. 4. You can only adjust tilt and scales within Void and Space Station modes, because we think it is better for a theatre to line up its horizon with the actual world :)"

I would have liked some capabilities from other players though, such as being able to adjust tilt, zoom and height with the thumb sticks for instance. Along with a setting for sharpness. Oh, and a way to exit too (?). Will probably use this as my default player now, especially now that subtitles in 3D work which they don't in for instance Bigscreen Beta.

In this regard the projected and wanted playstyle did not settle in most cases. Like, I always want cinema mode, which is not selectable as default. So you have to set it with every new movie. Cinema Mode itself has a to small screen, which takes away much of the 3D effects of the shown movie. I would like to have it resizable like DeoVR has it. Also it is very bad in detecting the mode of the movie (side by side or upper and lower panel)
Short: It needs settings which allows you to choose your personal view likings and a little improvement with movie state detection.

Comparing to some dev who has disappeared years ago since we all paid for his BETA (cough MaxVR cough).
According to their website, Skybox also supports DNLA and UPNP and all the NAS and Plex, on the other hand, it's such pain for the other VR players to even watch videos on my network drives.
