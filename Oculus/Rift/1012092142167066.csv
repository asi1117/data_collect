2022-05-28 14:13:45.666579,bkingcs,"A gorgeous, relaxing adventure game","If you are looking for a game that takes you away from reality and into breathtaking scenery with bright sun, nighttime, moonlit skies with stars, palm trees swaying in the wind, beaches, waterfalls, etc. where you are actively solving a variety of puzzles in this immersive, beautiful environment, then this is your game. The development team did an absolutely spectacular job with the graphics and sound. The puzzles are a bit challenging here and there, but are mostly pretty easy to solve, which allows you to really enjoy the scenery and your surroundings without getting frustrated by unsolvable puzzles. Highly recommended. (Playing using a Quest with AirLink, worked flawlessly.)","Jun 4, 2021 at 11:05 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 14:13:45.681539,G4mb10r,Relaxing Chill Puzzle-Solving,"This game is somewhere between a meditative escape and a puzzle game. The environments are great and the stories interesting. Some of the voice acting leaves something to be desired, and the movement controls are just plane wonky, but there is clearly a lot of heart in this game. The slow pace puzzle exploration is the perfect zen escape for someone like me. If you can get past the dumb movement controls, this really is a great game.","May 12, 2021 at 9:00 AM",4, 2,

The puzzles were just right.  Difficult, but not overly difficult.  I don't like shooting games, but more adventure/puzzle games - and this game delivered.  A lot of the puzzle game I have encountered on VR have been too simple.  But this one challenged me at times.  
I did not experience any motion sickness. Played on Oculus Quest with link.   
The only annoying thing was I did have to readjust my height after scene cuts.  But otherwise it was a very enjoyable experience!  Thank you?","May 4, 2020 at 7:30 AM",5, 14,

After playing for 15 minutes give or take I get a queasy stomach and a slight headache, and I don't get headaches.  The review I mentioned I cannot find again but it referenced turning off a setting to resolve this issue. Other than that it is a great game with superb graphics.","Mar 30, 2020 at 10:23 PM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 14:13:48.897531,XtremeHardcoreGamer,,"Good game. Demanding graphics. VR height adjust resets after every stage load. When adjusting draw distance- the game goes to a 50 percent render scale. And some settings refuse to stay put. And your character walks ridiculously slow. 

Other than that there are good puzzles, good voice acting, and great atmosphere. In the same genre as The Talos Principle VR- although imo, not as good. But the closest VR game *to that level* which is a complement.

 I experienced no sickness.","Apr 23, 2020 at 7:50 AM",5, 1,

The puzzles are just challenging enough that you have to think a bit but not so challenging that you get frustrated. And the scenery and music add just the right touch.

But i had no real expectations of Xing as I have never seen anyone talk about it (it is a couple years old). I bought it a month or so ago just bc it was on sale and then forgot about it. On a whim i decided to start it up earlier this week and wow. Beautiful, fun, can be somewhat challenging (im only like a quarter of the way thru i think), great music. Just an overall great VR experience.

2022-05-28 14:13:55.216899,Hanover,Great Game.  Needs save slots.,"This a huge game.  Each area could take you an hour or two to beat it and even then, there is more content after you finish the main game.  My biggest gripe is that I thought ""Restart Level"" meant just go back to the beginning of the current puzzle.  Unfortunately it brought me back to the very beginning of the entire ""episode"", and as I said, it can take quite a while to complete each challenge.  That is a problem with games that do not have save slots.  I just wanted to ""reset"" the puzzle, not start completely over!

Regardless, this game is gorgeous as long as you have the right graphics card.  I'd say this game is 10x better than Obduction.  You can go off the main path in many areas and just explore if you want to.  The theme of death is sort of a downer though, and the poetry sometimes feels like they're desperate for a rhyme.  

The game is split up into episodes that are all joined in one hub.  You have to tackle each area in a linear fashion.  There is a separate garden that opens up when you find enough of the runes in the main areas.  There are additional narratives  and experiences in there that you can get to fairly early in the game.

The puzzles themselves can be pretty tough, but they are fair.  Some of them are just a tad tedious though to where you make one mistake and you end up losing about three or four minutes worth of work as the puzzle resets and you have to start over.  The puzzles all follow various themes from making the wind blow in different directions, to making the sun rise and fall.

Finally, there are no comfort options here.  You will be moving forwards and turning in real time.  So if you get motion sickness, you might be prepared to return this if you end up feeling ill.  I, myself spent hours in this game without any issues.

This is a FULL game.  Feels like a real AA title in VR.  It's way beyond early VR too.  I highly recommend this.","Apr 28, 2019 at 1:20 AM",4, 14,

By the end I was really sad to have finished the puzzles. Everything about it is great, from the atmostpheric music to the way the puzzle challenges natrually progress so you rarely have to scratch your head but frequently enough you have to stop and think and sometimes there are stretch challenges for the optional runes that really challenge you. That plus the beautiful level design and pacing. I'm particularly happy to have so many choices for movement controls (I like smooth turning with right hand side and using left touch as joystick to move). Must have for everyone's inventory! Only two small quibbles for the developers: 1) wasn't clear why needed runes at first so I had to replay the level when decided I wante them 2) the 5th level is fantastic as others have said, but without the reviews here I wouldn't have known to search for the start and would have thought the game finished so maybe they can make that more obviously (note it's not the gated area with the mini-stories that you get access to with the runes).","Feb 14, 2019 at 9:30 AM",5, 8,

I completed it all. All 5 puzzle levels. You unlock an additional level after completing the first 4. I am not talking about those gates that you unlock with letters found in game. But a full 5th level of puzzles. It is this 5th level, that takes game to another level (it is sad some will review game without completing it). How much you loved it initially, you will love it more, a lot more, when you learn the story in 5th level. IT CAN MAKE YOU CRY AS YOU COMPLETE IT! You understand what the previous 4 levels were about. Also I loved game so much I got all the letters and all. Loved the game, the puzzles, the graphics, the design, the music - amazing music, the poetry, the words of wisdom, etc. Took me 19 hours to complete it (don't know if I should've taken that long but I enjoyed the sceneries, etc, and wanted to complete it 100% without any outside help whatsoever). I felt sad once I finished it. 5th level got me very emotional. I didn't want it to end. Thank you so much for this wonderful game!","Jan 10, 2019 at 10:50 AM",5, 10,

2022-05-28 14:14:01.520682,Ikon_,A great puzzle game,"This was a long beatiful game.
After about 10-12 hours i had rewired my brain completely and now understand Xing logic like water. The game lasted for about 14-16 hours and it cointained 4 main stories/puzzle maps, a whole bunch of walk through mini stories in different environments and a decent length ending chapter.
Apparently i forgot to collect a few of those golden letters so i didn't open all of the short stories, but found them from youtube instead.

I played the last 40% in desktop mode because of USB issues killing VR for a while. VR controls are more comfortable, but this game is a bit heavy for the hardware. My Geforce 1060 6GB + I7 6700HQ laptop was suffering at times, even when running pretty much low everything.

I was a bit concerned about the motion sickness others have mentioned, but I haven't experienced any. Obduction was 98% worse and I got used to that too so, maybe I'm just lucky.

2022-05-28 14:14:04.772091,Ckd76915,Beautiful VR Immersion,"First of all, its a really nice surrounding programmed by the authors. Dont miss to stroll around and discover all that beautiful Landscape. Puzzles are not to hard to solve and you'll have lots of hours to find the right doors to go on.
The only thing that stops me to give five stars ist the movement control. With the left stick of the xbox Controller you steer forth and back, left and right and this works continously.  With the right stick you control your Viewpoint, but its not continous , it jumps approx. 30 degrees to either side and this can cause nausea. It seems that the game was created for standing not sitting during play, so you can turn around 360 degrees.
Would be nice if the Authors could create a more comfortable mode for the 
couch potatoes :-) which dont want to jump around.
Some small complaint about the Zeneth Level, there are no puzzles to solve there only walking around, collecting some items. Maybe its possible to create some more levels in the future with these Landscapes of Zeneth.

2022-05-28 14:14:07.872370,SparkyNinja1583,What all the other 5 star reviews say,"I agree with pretty much every other 5 star review!

I noticed someone gave this 1 star because there was no ""sit down"" mode. I think 1 star is quite harsh for how awesome this game was (I 100% this game). To be honest I played most of this game sitting down and yeah I felt a little short but this game is meant to be a relaxing puzzler/explorer. Would a ""seated mode"" be helpful? Sure but the absence of one didn't stop me from enjoying the game at all. The ONLY time I felt short sitting down was during these short segments you go up to these podium looking things with text on them. It was hard to read the text sitting down on some of them but they are all read out loud to you.

I could go on about how great the graphics, music, voice acting etc. are but many other folks have done so already and I agree 100% with all of them. I got this on sale but this is a great VR title  worth the full price tag.

Some very minor things I'll mention but do not let this stop you from buying it. I liked to explore every corner and I got stuck a couple times. It was clear I was going somehwere I shouldn't have. In the desert area I found the sand in the wind to be a tad too much. I'm really reaching here now. A small handful of puzzles can be cheesed a little. Felt smart for it though xD","Jul 9, 2018 at 9:03 AM",5, 7,

2022-05-28 14:14:07.903288,nightcat.mau,Beautiful,"First off, this is a beautiful game, and most of the puzzles were fun. The music was beautiful and it was nice to relax and go at my own pace. I even loved the idea of the gated area containing additional stories. Which is where the game fell flat for me as a casual player. I will do a lot of back and forthing if it remains fun and I do love puzzles. But some of the puzzles were just too frustrating to me like the clock bridge and some of the runes were just a bit too much to get to. Since you can complete the game with zero runes and the gated area is optional you can play it more or less casually, but there is no option to skip a puzzle and move on. Overall five stars, but if you’d rather just explore casually I’d say go for a meditation app instead.","Jun 24, 2018 at 5:59 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 14:14:14.208173,Sakkura,An expanding journey,"Xing starts out as a nice stroll through beautiful areas, and you feel like a few light puzzle elements are just there to keep your hands moving. But then you move through to new areas, always adding more complications to deal with, and gradually it starts to get actually challenging. The serene and slightly surreal atmosphere never goes away though, even as the character and theme of the environments changes dramatically.","Mar 4, 2018 at 7:24 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 14:14:14.224131,lordhelmos,,"To get this out of the way, I did have 2 issues with this game.  The first was the game freezing when accidentally disabling VR mode and the second was hyperpixellization that did not allow me to see menus after accidentally trying to change the FoV distance in the options menu.  This required a re-intall.

I just wanted to point these items out so the devs are aware, but other than that I will still rank this game a 5/5.

Xing is an excellent product with painstaking detail and amazing ambience.  This is the ultimate Zen puzzle game that will relax you no matter how frustrated you get at a puzzle.  This game truly is about exploration and it conveys this excellently well.

So one thing I wanted to pointed out and probably the most important thing about the product is the huge array of control options the devs have added in for VR support.  One very important thing this game does is that it gives you a huge array of options to combat VR motion sickness caused by turning with a stick or controller.

The way the game does this is that it allows you to ""teleport turn"" in angles of 22 degrees.  You can set this number lower and lower until you eventually hit 0.

This game is the ultimate training experience for people new to VR and you can ""grow your VR legs"" and train you mind not be confused with VR turning by starting at 22 degrees and slowly dialing back until you hit 0 as you play.

Any first timer VR player should add this game to their library as a training program for how to move and interact in VR.  This game is an irreplacable part of my library and something I would recommend to any first time VR player to learn how VR works, be exposed to beautiful atmospheres, and be encompassed in a great Myst-style puzzler with an interesting concept and story.","Mar 11, 2018 at 11:00 AM",5, 14,

2022-05-28 14:14:14.256045,Dubszu,"Xing is a journey, one worth taking...","Few, if any, other games have given me the sensation of having just returned from ""someplace else"" when I take off my headset quite like Xing did.

The environments, music and most of all the story/journey are inspiring and ultimately quite uplifting. 

The environments are beyond vast and varied, someone took great care creating them. 

The music reminded me of classic FF and Chrono Trigger tunes, catchy yet moving and grand at the same time.

Finally the story/journey was the main event, the part of the game that I'm glad I saw the whole quest through for.

It is a puzzle game. The puzzle's sometimes required patience and sometimes even walking away for a few hours... if you try to plow through it you will definitely become frustrated.

However, if you play through the game over the course of a few days / weeks (I took my time and did it in about 2 weeks with 8 hours total gametime) I think you will find that Xing is one of the best journeys you can take in VR. You should do it.

To the Devs: Bravo and thank you, the only thing that I'd love to see improved would be performance, however my system is by no means the best of the best (MSI GT73VR with 1070/7700HQ) so please take this in mind. Cheers.","Feb 9, 2018 at 12:55 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 14:14:14.271005,Willard1975,Relaxing and Enjoyable,"So i took a break from Elite Dangerous and was looking around the store for something relaxing, and found this.

- Beautiful graphics.
- Soothing soundtrack.
- Nice puzzles.
- Decent controls.
- Lengthy game (for a VR title).
- No motions sickness (at least for me).

I'm only on the second level but so far i haven't experienced any bugs. All around, a very enjoyable game when you want a break from all things killing, explosions, zombies and whatever else is out there :)

There's no real ""WOW"" or ""WTF"" factor so i'm giving it four stars.","Mar 20, 2018 at 4:57 AM",4, 5,

Seemed abit dated, maybe its the style, but its very important in a contemplative game like this. Others seemed to like it, so maybe personal taste, expected more from the reviews. Some of the puzzles are good, not the best movement options. Obstruction looks and feels far better IMO.","Mar 23, 2018 at 7:18 AM",3, 1,

I was so busy in 2017 with the amount of VR games on offer, I think I missed some gems. Xing: The Land Beyond is one of those gems. It gets everything right in VR and is a stunning title that every Oculus owner should try. On the surface it appears to be just a puzzle game, but deep down it offers so much more. I was in constant wonder and amazement.  Had I played this in 2017 it would have 100% been in my Top 20 games.","Feb 4, 2018 at 5:19 AM",5, 10,

An important tip is that you do not need to collect the runes. They have no meaning. Collecting the runes is sometimes very difficult and can drive you insane. To reach the end of the game is possible without to much difficulty.","Jan 8, 2018 at 1:08 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 14:14:17.418720,DirkWinston,Exceptional game. Almost meditative,This is a terrific game. It's not rock them sock them or lots of guns and shooting and stuff like that. I have found it to actually be a very calming game. That's not to say it's without its challenges. It's quite challenging at times but it's more challenging mentally than physically. Visually it's stunning and I love the device of being able to change it from daylight to moonlight. That's really wonderful. And the puzzles are just the right degree of difficulty to keep the game rather relaxing. I hope the game is incredibly successful because I'd like to see more games like this. I like the mentality of this game and it permeates the entire game. I honor the team that created it and hope they will create some more wonderful games in the future,"Dec 18, 2017 at 2:41 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 14:14:17.434677,Laskan,An ideal VR experience.,"Immersive environments, progressively more challenging puzzles that introduce mechanics as you go, and avoid the all-too-common ""we made this hard just for the sake of being hard"" issue.  Puzzles primarily revolve around making alterations to the environment (day/night, rain/no rain, winter/summer, wind), and can result in some interesting combinations.  Completionists will enjoy the collection items, people who love stories will enjoy the vignettes.  I most enjoyed the variation in environments and music.

This is one of my first games that had fluid movement and a jump button.  Jumping is easy to get the hang of, but I mention these things for anyone who has issues with any movement other than teleportation.

A top-notch experience that's only impeded by the movement controls.  While I appreciate that with practice, my navigation skills will improve, the obvious choice (fluent continuous directional movement using both thumbsticks) is sorely missing.  Continuous smooth movement will deliver the experience we crave.  I hope the developer makes this a top priority.","Oct 22, 2017 at 12:18 PM",5, 3,"You can enable smooth yaw rotation by opening the menu, going to settings / VR, then setting ""Click turn amount"" down to 0 degrees.

Annoyances: Why do all of these First Person Shooter type VR game makers insist on making you characters forward motion into a side slew if you veer left of right while walking!  Following any curved path means not only veering as you walk but manually rotating as you walk as well to avoid comming out the other side of the curve walking sideways!

I've updated ,y comments leaving only those issues I felt still remain from the original post.

The developers have responded amazingly quickly to the issues. Rather then shy aware from the their problems they jumped to action and I have a lot of respect for that! In doing so, numerous fixes were implemented but broke something else.

Your performance problem seems unusual, especially with such high end hardware (I developed the game on a 980). I would double check to make sure nothing is running in the background, and that your settings are indeed set to something reasonable. Make sure the screen percentage setting in the display settings menu is not set too high as well. A 1080ti should be able to easily run XING at at least medium settings at screen percentage 130+, as other users have reported. Lastly, check to see if your video drivers are update, just as a precaution."
