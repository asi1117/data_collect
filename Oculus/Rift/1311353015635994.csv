The exhibits are described in French, but my French is not so good.  But I was able to understand most of it.  I think they were trying to make a statement about violence in society, especially gun violence and replace it with flowers.  While that's a nice sentiment, the exibits themselves are something akin to what Jeffrey Dahmer or Ted Bundy or the Green River Killer aka Ted Cruz may have come up with in their dream shop of horrors.  You can grab them and hold them up close and they are very gruesomly detailed.  Then you enter this empty room and a film starts playing that is somewhat confusing.  Those crazy French people, Sacre Bleu!","Mar 3, 2018 at 12:24 PM",3, 16,
