Something about playing the game whilst hiding it under your desk and distracting the teacher in school is so simple but an absolute blast. I completed the game in around 2 Hours which I was not disapointed by because i never got bored, Im certainly going to revisit some of the levels. Worth every pennie!","Jul 31, 2020 at 3:14 AM",5, 5,

Whether you are an 80's kid looking to relive your childhood or a new VR gamer looking for a fun game... this is the game for you. A wonderful way to mix dimensions (literally) in a fun, but not too easy package. It took me several attempts to beat the last couple of stages. However, the victory felt very well earned and I had a blast.","Apr 24, 2020 at 2:00 PM",5, 10,

The classroom scenes got a little repetitve as did much of the audio but overall, the fun level was off the charts!

If you strip back all the bells and whistles this is just a 2D platform game really. And for me, far too much of that was spent playing on a virtual black and white gameboy.

Edit: If you are born in the 80s, played NES and now enjoy life with another person (with the possible addition of a few kids) you will simply love this game. I wished it never ended. I could just sit there to be honest (part of the beauty, especially if you have kids). Additionally if you like legal and/or medical marijuana this game might possibly open an actual portal to your childhood. Regardless of actual events your childhood will be awesome.

Playing a super-outdated gameboy-type game in VR wasn't much fun.  Distracting the teacher wasn't any kind of challenge and just repetitive.  I'd love to see these devs make another (better) game with this level of detail and quality.","Jan 2, 2019 at 6:44 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 15:36:33.545204,SparkyNinja1583,,"It's short but I loved it. 

Someone said this game needs more check points. I don't agree. There were plenty of check points. The multi-step boss fight even had check points built in so I don't get that person's complaint. Maybe it got patched in later? Who knows. Also it seems this game was a throwback to the early 80s when Gameboy and the original NES were king. Those games didn't have check points. When you ran out of lives you started from the beginning. 

By the way I found playing with motion controls was a little weird. It was a little more immersive but I found it it harder to play the game so I used an xbone controller.","Jan 2, 2019 at 8:56 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:36:33.560163,Hanover,Needs More Checkpoints,"This game was pretty cool until you get to the multi-part bosses that take about 10 minutes to finish each part.  Then one mistake sends you all the way back to the beginning.  In VR this is excruciating and holds you hostage because you know if you don't finish the current boss, you'll end up having to go back to the beginning of the level.  

I ended up getting to the final boss, spent about an hour trying to beat it and gave up and uninstalled it.  Sorry, but devs, give us a better checkpoint system so I can go back to the beginning of the part rather than the beginning of the entire boss fight or I'll never see the end of your game.","Nov 11, 2018 at 9:46 AM",2, 12,
2022-05-28 15:36:36.654885,whoa182,A fantastic and unique VR game!,"As someone who was still a kid in the late 80s and early 90s, Pixel Ripped made me feel an instant sense of nostalgia. Early on in the game you start off in a classroom, where you're trying to avoid getting caught playing your Gear Kid,  by the teacher who wants nothing more than for you to pay attention. 

Trying to run through the levels on your handheld device while avoiding the wrath of the teacher can prove challenging at first. But don't worry, you're not stuck in the classroom, the game takes you to other places.

You will get so drawn into playing these retro style games (which can be challenging) that you lose track of time.

It's hard to put into words how this game made me feel. Everything about it from the design of the world, the references, the sounds of the game device (and radio), and even the chatter you hear from the kids, took me back to how it felt being in primary school in the UK.

While the game might seem simple at first glance, the genius comes into play as the virtual world you inhabit and the gameworld start to intermix. The game is truly unique and is easily one of the best VR games of 2018.

Whatever you do, do not pass on this game. It's clear that a lot of passion has gone into it, and it really shows. It's super polished, highly enjoyable, and shows just why VR is an incredible technology. It allows developers to tell stories in ways that are just not possible on 2D gaming platforms.

The only regret I have is not playing it Pixel Ripped sooner!","Dec 23, 2018 at 6:53 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:36:36.670843,isaaccheng8,Great plaformer FPS to reboot childhood,"When I was little, I spent too much time studying and not enough time playing. Pixel Rippled 1989 lets me relive my childhood right. At Level 1, the main gameplay is a 2-D platformer (with shooting) on a gameboy. The first-person shooter (FPS) aspect requires using gaze to shoot at sparkling things in a classroom. It feels weird like shooting arrows in Tomb Raider running on vorpX and yet quite playable. The level ends with an awesome colorful 3-D VR third-person platformer (with shooting). The Nightmare Level is a zombie FPS. Your weapon is a color gameboy, which acts as both a flashlight and a firearm. To activate the weapon, you play a 2-D platformer on the color gameboy to find a letter ""B"" to turn the gameboy to ""Badass Mode."" The zombies approach you from all directions like in ZomDay and The Brookhaven Experiment. It is fun and challenging. This FPS is much more natural and comfortable because you aim with your hands and not your head.

Pixel Rippled 1989 is a well-made, beautiful, family-friendly VR game that has lots of replay value like those classic video games made in the 80s.","Dec 31, 2018 at 9:32 AM",5, 0,

Gameplay - Works great !! Both on the gameboy in your hands as well as other things you need to tackle. Easy to pick up, at the same time it's not a cake walk if you remember games such as Mega Man etc.. ( don't want to spoil ). 
Audio - The theme song will get stuck in your head and you will get that smile on your face each time you boot the game up. Also I love the 8 bit sounds and music.
Visuals - Crisp, Clean and Vibrant - Looks Amazing - Very Imersive wich is a main factor when I review VR games. 
Fun Factor - It's GREAT !! I tested this as an older gamer and had tons of fun.  I also tested with different age groups = younger kids have fun just shooting spit wads and hiding from the teacher. Very Fun
Replay Value - Yes, I will be going back in to find all the cartridges and easter eggs. Plus it's a good game to show off to new VR users. 
Verdict - This game is a gem, do not let this game pass your radar. My only gripe is I want more, but definatley worth the price.  You will get that nostagia feeling when playing through this. I love the different factors when playing, Hardcore, while using stealth - a game within a game. The game is unique, fun and a must own for all VR users. 9/10","Aug 6, 2018 at 9:50 PM",5, 18,
2022-05-28 15:36:36.718714,nrosko,VR really is a gimmick.,"You are basically playing a mediocre retro 2d platformer in a mediocre VR enviroment. There is no tracking of the controler so i felt quite detached from the game kid. Also there is no animation when you put it down it just dissapears & its way too sensitive even the slightest look up & the game kid vanishes during game play this is really irritating. You are supposed to distract the teacher  by shooting at objects with what i assume is a straw seeing as it sticks out of your face, also there is no animation to pick it up. i find this especially tedious, more so due to the fact that you frequently have to do this & it gets boring quick. Sound design is also quite poor just sounds like a wall of sound. I think it was this that made me have to turn it off after 20 minutes. 
 The nostalgia was lost on me tbh & just feels like a gimmick there was no substance to this game. It didn't really feel much like 89 when i was at school either, electro & breakdancing was already yesterdays news. And i would rather spend my time on an Amiga than playing a gameboy maybe thats why i didn't gel with this game.","Aug 3, 2018 at 2:39 AM",2, 21,
2022-05-28 15:36:39.810445,themerote,The Matrix of video games,"This is groundbreaking, the future of VR, Oculus Rift should come with this game, this my fellow gamers is what VR is about, it is the Super Mario of VR. I'm so happy I have this game, it is a true gem. It reminds me of the movie The Never Ending Story but with a video game instead of a book, it has so many throw backs to the 80's I absolutely can't wait for more games in the series. Be prepared for many clones of this game, it has started a new genre. Hats of to the developer who came up with this, she absolutely nailed it. The best VR game ever made.

Update, I have finally beaten the Main Boss, it took me about 3 hours but really felt alot more as I was constantly in VR, the difficulty spike is really not as bad as some reviews have state and actually down scored it because of that, Infact I would love if there is a higher difficulty that can be unlocked or in an update in the future. I found 4 cartridges but have to go back and find the others, This reminds me of finding every secret level in Super Mario World, I found some clues throughout the game in the later levels in the real world for the earlier ingame levels for finding cartriges, I hear there are some secret portals once all cartiges are found???, this game is intended to be replayed like the games of old. One tip use touch controllers, gamepad is not really an option its horrible, just doesnt work as no motion control on the pad, not the devs fault but I think they should just remove it from the game completely, one of the other reviews here seemed to have played the whole game with the gamepad and I think is ruined their experience but saying that who uses game pads since the touch controllers came out? no one. You cant move the Gear Kid closer to your face or put it under the table, you may as well play Oculus Go, Someone should do a 3D print of the Gear Kid so you can attach the touch controller and sell it on Ebay, I'll be you first customer.

The controls are tight, the humor is accessible but funny, the absolute meta-ness of the game is rad, the graphics & colors are very clear & vivid, and for it's simplicity it has an intensity about it that is what I look for in VR games. It has that wow factor that is so quick and surprising but not jarring.

It's an absolute blast of a ride with the perfect balance of retro-throwback, modern innovation, and simple yet fullfillingly intense mechanics!

The developers fine-tuned the game for 4 years and it's great. So much elements, so much immersion it is simply one of the best VR experiences for 2018!
It’s a throw back into the 90s but done very well. Mixing classics, mixing the real world and the VR world, mixing 2d and 3d in a spectacular way. The style, the colors and the gameplay is all the best you can get.

2022-05-28 15:36:39.855325,WarrenS,Read this before you buy,"All in all I had fun mostly with the idea of the game and not really playing it. There are a few times where you aim with the actual gameboy-esque console but mostly its a simple biti platformer.

The VR application in my opinion was poor, your hands are glued in a fixed position holding the gameboy thing and you use your head to fire spitballs to distract the teacher which gets tiresome because for every level you have to do this 5-10 times. Also using the spitball thing was laughably simple. So aside from the nice nostalgic feel, I felt like i should have just played sonic the headgehog the way anything i touch and all the pixels burst outta me.

2022-05-28 15:36:39.871282,ajb1978,"Classic 80's gameplay, with a meta twist","I've been looking forward to playing the final version ever since playing the ""Pixel Rift"" demo back in the DK1 days, and it did indeed live up to the hype.  Its meta approach to gameplay knocks the ball out of the park in two ways.  1: Classic 80's gaming, including screaming in frustration.  ""I totally pressed jump!  Why didn't you jump?!  Oh come on at least let me get UP there!  AARGH""  And 2: Getting away with playing video games when you're not supposed to.  Sure, plenty of retro games recreate that 80's look and feel, where it's all trial and error and no hand-holding.  But as a grown adult who can pretty much play video games whenever he wants to, the experience of trying to avoid getting caught and being at the mercy of grown-ups if you are...that really took me back.  I mean I used to play my Game Boy in class...I remember how tricky that was.  It's no different here.","Aug 21, 2018 at 9:50 AM",5, 4,

Being a kid in the 90's, I remember furiously trying to beat games on the Gameboy and Game Gear, and this title brings those feelings of accomplishment back. The game-within-a-game concept is executed well, and the sense of immersion is greatly enhanced for it.

If you blaze through it, sure you can beat it in a couple hours; but there are lots of hidden easter eggs and extra fun to be found if you let yourself get sucked into the world a bit.

About to start my second playthrough just to grab all cartridges in order to pick custom Gear Kid colors, and really like the idea of different variants of this game based on game console era (70's & 90's etc). Highly recommended.","Aug 2, 2018 at 7:47 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 15:36:46.119571,gtasick,"UK nostalgia, still works for the US ...","Pixel Ripped is a solid game with fun mechanics and generally good gameplay. I haven’t even looked up the developer, but I assume they’re British due to the setting, humor and references. Personally, this detracts slightly from the nostalgia (as I’m American) and it took me a bit longer to get into the game, but there are still plenty of similarities I connect to. The pixel art and 8/16-bit gameplay are excellent, a ton of fun to play. However, the 3D elements of the game need some serious work to match the quality of the pixel art. On the topic of controls, previous retro game experiences in VR have always been a bit awkward, because my hands aren’t holding a single controller, and using an analog stick vs. a D-pad felt unnatural. However, the gameplay in Pixel Ripped was designed for VR so I’ve had no issues with jump accuracy or timing. The story is OK, but it seems rather generic. I’ve yet to complete the game, but I’m hoping it’ll contain some unexpected twists like Duck Season. Overall, Pixel Ripped is a very fun and light-hearted adventure through retro gaming and British nostalgia. It’s also one of my favorite VR games to date.","Aug 29, 2018 at 9:00 AM",4, 1,

Sound mixing is WAY off and found no way to lower the game sound over the ambience. Everything is way to loud at once and mixed together. Would love the option to lower the sound of the handheld.

The game itself is a mixture of ""Gamer"" and a lite mega man clone. Both of which are fun but not super in-depth. Looks to be 4 levels with a boss fight at the end of each.","Aug 1, 2018 at 3:47 AM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 15:36:46.167443,MeddleGearSalad,"FANTASTIC, except for last boss *spoiler","I have to knock off half a star for the last fight. Waaaayyy toooooo long of a fight. Wave after wave after wave after wave of endless easy to kill dudes, and you're just waiting for random chance to drop the ""B"" mode. And hopefully you better not accidentally drop the ""B"" off the side, because you're gonna have to slog through a whole bunch more waves just to get a chance to hit the guy! And if you make a mistake, you have to do another wave after wave after wave just to get back to where you were. 

It felt overly time consuming and was really the only part of the game that made me want to quit. 

The other half of the star I'm knocking you off for is some of the sound implementation. I found myself feeling like my ears were bleeding and I double checked and my machine's volume was at 50%. 

The most egregious problem I had though was that high pitched warble right before a level loads. It wasn't just that it was very high pitched and high volume and piercing, it was also that it just popped off at the end, which also kind of felt like a piercing in my ears. That could have been faded out in a short number of samples so that the waveform didn't literally pop in my ear. This isn't an aesthetic critique, this actually hurts ears, and could damage speakers if we weren't using the Oculus headphones. 

That being said, I thought there was some REALLY clever use of sound between the classroom and the game, music and sound effects were pretty great. 

Gameplay was solid, visuals were solid.

Complaints and nitpicks aside, this is a fantastic game and I'd recommend it to anyone.*  That first intro when the room you're gets destroyed by the monster of the game you were playing, that's magical. That threw me back to days of sitting in my bedroom with a tiny tube screen and my NES hooked up.  

* Except maybe the last boss because even attempting the boss is a time committment simply because of the controlled nature of when the player is allowed to hit the boss.","Aug 21, 2018 at 4:09 PM",4, 1,

That's about all I should need to say, buy it now, I played the whole thing in about 1 hour, and I just got off after finishing to write a review, and I already want to go back and replay my favorite bits.  I'll say it again, buy this game, especially if you have a sweet tooth for retro rewinds.","Aug 1, 2018 at 3:30 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 15:36:49.285104,HauntedFolly,Short but sweet jaunt of nostalgia,"Welcome to the future of the past! Retro Gameboy style gaming, explored through futuristic (relative to the game's time period) Virtual Reality!
I've gotta say I very greatly enjoyed this game, despite it's short play time.
Pros: A blast from the past with retro style gaming really takes me back to my childhood in the mid to late 90's, with all my hand-me-down NES and Gameboy stuff, and it's very easy to lose yourself in the Gear Kid to the point you forget about the in-game ""real world"" along with the actual real world.
The game has a great overall atmosphere, and good 3D visuals to suppliment the great pixel art of the 2D game.
Cons: The play time is fairly short, with my playthrough taking only roughly 3 hours, and once you've finished, the game doesn't provide a very large amount of replay value. Running back through the levels to collect hidden carts to unlock Gear Kid skins gives it a bit more content, but not much.

In the end I was left very pleased with the content I did experience, but sadly with how short the entire experience is, and the amount of time the project was in development, I'm left more than slightly underwhelmed.
I still recommend this game as a must play for anyone looking for a retro nostalgic jaunt into the days of yore, just be aware of the short play time before purchasing.

Overall: Greatly enjoyable, far too short.","Aug 6, 2018 at 10:22 AM",3, 5,
