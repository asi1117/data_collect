1. For 3D videos, it seems to have a 0% ability to detect if they're 360, 180, SBS, OU, even if it's literally in the file name. Every other player does this by default, but I manually have to specify each time.
2. Audio goes to my default speakers, for some reason. I have to manually toggle all sound to my Rift and then back each time I use this. Forget other players, every other game and app somehow does this just fine, but Moon Player doesn't.
3. The UI is awful. Huge buttons everywhere, but each has a tiny activation spot near the bottom where you see the button light up and you can press it.
4. Minor, but file names tend to not update often on the player. I could be playing a new video and still see the old title. 

All in all It's just enough to keep from requesting a refund,  but just barely. Hopefully it improves.","Dec 11, 2019 at 3:51 PM",3, 3,"Sorry to bring you a bad experience, I have received your feedback, please look forward to our next version
