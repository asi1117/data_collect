I've not played for too long yet only an hour but i must say the controls need some work, i prefer locomotion rather than teleport and found myself stuck a lot when walking the streets, the snap turn has a terrible delay which makes turning around very long-winded and lastly can there be some kind of distance snap-to-grip added? i say this due to weapons dropping on the floor when a customer doesn't want the item and i find myself IRL bending down to the floor and almost scraping my knuckles around the carpet trying to grab the weapon again. Sorry if any of these issues have resolutions i'm not seeing please let me know if so. Still i give 4 stars as i really enjoyed the game so far and found it quite relaxing. Looking forward to seeing what comes in future updates.","Apr 1, 2019 at 6:17 AM",4, 8,"Hello Kingsman_Eggsie,
Thank you for the review, others also complained about locomotion glitch. I will look into fixing that with next update. Also, I am planning on adding a ""snap-to-grip"" so that you don't have to bend down IRL. I am glad you enjoyed the game even though it has issues, but I am working hard on fixing them. Thank you for patience and support!"

2022-05-28 19:40:20.433868,UndeadHuman,This is actually fun!,"I bought this to try it out, then return. Didn't notice how few hours passed by. Wasn't mentioned in the description but you have an apartment and you can decorate it with money you earn in your shop. I definitely recommend me it.","Apr 15, 2019 at 2:39 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:40:20.448829,SomeHooman,Fun and relaxing,"I like this game. Its no action packed, in contrary chill and laidback. There some controls is a bit lagging like it was mentioned in another comment. But I had fun playing it.","Apr 5, 2019 at 10:11 AM",4, 5,
