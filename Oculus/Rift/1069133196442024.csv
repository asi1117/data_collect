Plus, each job option is different and fairly unique from the others! The one thing keeping this review of 5 stars is what to do after the main quests are complete. Sure, being able to complete more orders is nice, but then it gets old. It would be nice if the developers added some more things to do, such as a free roam area or possibly be able to own your own workspace / trophy room and get some items after you do certian things (ex. getting an egg after you cook eggshells in the chef career or something random like that) Otherwise, it's a great and comfortable game to play!","Apr 23, 2020 at 6:14 AM",4, 115,

2022-05-28 11:32:41.261194,TheReviewer,A in depth review,"This game sticks with it’s goal to be a “Job Simulation”.  Inside the game, you are first introduced with a  robot which teaches you how to get back to the hub etc.  Inside any of the jobs, you are introduced with a board which gives you instructions on what you can do.    Once a task is completed, the game automatically saves.  Back at the hub, you get to choose from which level you start at.

Pros: 
1. Everywhere you work is a smallish area, meaning that you could walk around (reduces dizziness) 

2. The game is very interactive and you can touch, and move almost everything at any given time

3. The game is not restrictive, and you could do anything you want, but the game itself will not gain levels.

 4. All of the game modes are mostly realistic, but still offering that hint of FUN! 

5. Game is great for kids!  Even offering a “I AM SMALL” lever underneath the area where you put game chartregies. 
 
6. Family Friendly + Party friendly.  This game is a great game for families and parties, as you could direct people on what to do from your TV, Computer, or even phone! 

7. Youtuber friendly.  In the game, you have an option to enable spectator mode, which gives you a controllable camera which you can put anywhere you want, and have it playing on your computer screen.   It may reduce frame rate, but for a youtuber, controlling the camera angle is a must have! (you could enable something from your desktop and control camera angles from there without having the virtual camera in your way) 

There is way more I could add, but I feel as if these are the mains

CONS

1. Depending on the audience you may get bored easily

2. Although you could through things at robots, the only thing they do is spark as little bit, and not have any major reaction

3. Instead of using the front tigger, you must use the SIDE!
As one can tell, there are a lot more pros than cons.  So if you do not mind the cons, then go right ahead and buy this game. I loved it, and I am sure almost everyo","Feb 28, 2020 at 2:14 AM",5, 46,

2022-05-28 11:33:22.307416,NotaHumanResource,Entertaining and funny,"My children 12 and 14 wanted me to get this game. It looked cartoonish and dumb but I purchased at thier request.  This game had me laughing within seconds.  We have about 20 titles in our library but this one gets a lot of play and is even fun to watch others play it. The jobs last about 30 min a piece but you can stay longer and mess around. You can't get fired no matter how bad you perform and the bots love you. There are 4 jobs.  I would give it 5 stars but I would like to see more interaction with objects. (more songs on the boom box, throw computer over cubicle , use coffee cup and water to put out fire etc.) You can interact with almost every object in this game but not everything.  If the developers could have done exactly what they have done with this game but more of it so that the creativity and interaction was 100% this game would be 5 stars.  This game is a lot of fun and very funny.","Mar 18, 2019 at 1:47 AM",4, 2,

The game has recieved a new update, allowing for endless missions in all jobs. This adds emense amounts of replayability, and even though it got slightly boring after a few hours, as the missions became repetetive, this update is great, and has allowed me to put a few more hours, into one of my favorite VR games.

But I've got a decently large tracking area, the largest I can get with in my room, with 3 cameras, at over 8ftx7ft.. Yet this Oculus version of the game seems to restrict me to the smallest play size possible in the game regardless. It just doesn't seem to account for all my extra space.
And as a result, while still remaining inside my guardian boarder, I can walk all the way outside of the play/work space, almost standing behind the robot-customers or job-bot. lol Kinda game breaking.
From what I've seen on yt, the SteamVR version seems to resize fine, and very dynamically.. So when I noticed I seem to have more space than some of those videos..
I feel like I'm missing out.. Tho maybe I'm just mistaken, and it needs EVEN MORE space before that takes effect. :/
So for now, 3 stars.. I'd give 5 overall, but this issue really bugs me.","Oct 26, 2017 at 2:52 AM",3, 5,

2022-05-28 11:34:09.864021,7unnix,A little pricey but a lot of fun!,"To mirror what others have said, this is more of an 'experience' than a game; you complete the given tasks whilst being a bit silly along the way. However, it is A LOT OF FUN.
The cartoon style graphics looks fantastic in VR and you do feel really immersed in your chosen role. There are plenty of laughs to be had and it's an excellent example of VR to show friends and family.
My only disappointment (and reason for 4 stars instead of 5) was the price Vs hours of gameplay. Realistically, once you've completed each of the 4 job roles, there's no reason to go back and so overall there's only an hour or two max game time per player and for the price paid (£18.99 at time of review) it doesn't feel like quite enough value for money. That being said, I'm hopeful that future updates will bring new job roles (so many potential jobs to simulate: Policeman, Doctor, Computer Technician, Builder).  I just hope that if this is the case, they add a few for free before charging for additional DLC. 
My advice: If don’t watch any YouTube clips of gameplay before you buy, as you’ll likely ruin all of the laughs for yourself. If you’ve got some cash to blow however, go for it. It’s a lot of fun!","Aug 20, 2017 at 10:45 AM",4, 5,

I love it's fun, cartoon-like art style and it's humour. I love how you can pick up any item you want and throw it, smash it, or eat it. I was truly amazed at how many things you can do (If you put your head on the photocopier, you can copy your brain! And if you see a robot wearing a hat or glasses, you can actually steal them and put them on!). This game has made me LOL more then any other VR title, and it is a must have for all VR owners!
