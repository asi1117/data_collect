2022-05-28 18:50:04.763971,Primewitha13,An Incredible Experience,"Jet Island is currently my favorite VR game. It does so much right to create a unique and fun experience for the player. Whether it's jumping off a ramp, swinging around towers, fighting drones and giant bosses, or just sliding down a hill on your hoverboard, Jet Island keeps you constantly entertained. It might take some time to get the hang of the jets and hookshots, but once you have an understanding for them, it makes just moving from point A to B one of the most fun activities in the world. Not only that, but Jet Island is still getting updates and support such as a Level Editor in the near future. Master Indie, if you're reading this, you knocked it out of the park with Jet Island and I can't wait to see what's next from you.","Jun 30, 2019 at 2:54 PM",5, 15,

2022-05-28 18:50:04.797881,XtremeHardcoreGamer,I like it.,"Once I got the hang of the locomotion the game became quite the experience. Similar to Windlands in that there is a learning curve and wide open spaces with an emphasis on exploration (and grapplers). I usually get sick with smooth turning but I feel it was a necessity in playing this game seated. I turned it on and the game got easier and thankfully, no motion sickness yet. Knock on wood. There are still some rough edges, like when you are upside down, your visual orientation doesn't change, which makes it hard to navigate some cylinders and loops. IDK how the dev solves that one though. 

The boss battles are epic.","Apr 9, 2019 at 1:43 PM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 18:50:07.925515,taquitobuddy,Somewhat bland and doesn't compare well,"While this game isn't terrible, I can't recommend it myself.  There are 3 main issues.  First, the controls aren't fantastic.  Using a combination of thrusters, grappling hook, and gun all at the same time isn't just challenging - due to the button placement is it nearly unmanagable.  Along with other quirks like having the grappling retract also be the gun fire button, made the controls overall frustrating.  Next, the graphics, while servicable, are very bland and dull, with low quality ground textures everywhere.  The world is large, but lifeless.  Finally, compared to a very similar game in many ways, Windlands 2, this one just doesn't compare well.  If you are a huge fan of Windlands and have completed that entirely, then maybe check out this, but anyone else I'd definately recommend Windlands 2 over this.","Mar 20, 2019 at 4:27 AM",2, 2,

Almost a religious experience to swing around this massive land and take on bosses etc. Absolutely love it and would recommend to anyone.

2022-05-28 18:50:07.970395,DButcha,Focuses on what matters!,"This game is wild, gameplay is super fun and reminiscent of tribes ascend where speed and high altitude are key. There isn't a dull moment when racing around the giant map even though everything around you appears dull and lifeless. The obstacle courses (gauntlets to find bosses) are a hidden gem and bosses are unique and interesting.

My only Cons:
- Please allow rearranging of controls devs!!
- Do not play if motion sickness ever occurs to you, or if you have a fear of heights! I have a minor fear of heights but it really adds a thrill when you're thousands of feet high. Scary!!

Controls Explained- The new abilities in the new update make my argument baseless! All buttons and triggers etc are used fully. It is now a preference thing to re arrange them and its not really important.","Nov 16, 2018 at 8:36 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 18:50:11.112990,ShiZZ_DiGG,Awesome Game!!!!,"Early access, you mean Pearly Access. Its that good, even in its ""early "" stages. Locomation is done very uniquely and very well! I see other reviews talking about Ironman and Spiderman having a baby, and the are 100% right! Great fun by your self but event better with a group of friends. Took me about an hour to figure out how to moove around with ease, not a developers issuse, just me figuring out what works. When that happened and ""clicked"", thats when I realized what the developer intended. VERY Easy to start on the groud, get going sever hundred KPH and be soring through the air within seconds. One time I was going so fast, it literally took me about 5-7 minutes to fall to the ground because I launched my self so high. HAHA. Im on the developer discord and they keep tempting me with the upgrades that are coming. Only downside to that is that STEAM allows you to download the beta updates....developer stated that when everything is cemented, update will be released on Oculus. Looking forward to it. Overall, great game and great concept.  There aren't may games that expierment with different locomotion types, but it seem that the ones who do, and implement it well, just show that the potential for VR is....virtually untapped. Adventurous game, amazing locomotion, and awesomely fun multiplalyer. Looking forward for the update!!!!","Oct 31, 2018 at 2:51 PM",5, 6,

Since the update of a couple of days ago I have completely changed my mind on this game.  Now it is awesome!  The developer updated the tutorial, made the instructions easily visible, tweaked how much thrust you have on your jets, and added in a nice 'easy' boss at the end of the tutorial.

2022-05-28 18:50:11.141912,jakie_,Most satisfying locomotion in VR to date,"While the ""story"" is short and the graphics are slightly worse than Halo 1, this game has some of the most exhilerating gameplay I've ever encountered in any video game.  It essentially serves as a proof of concept for its method of locomotion, and it absolutely nails it.  This might be the first time that a VR game has had swinging mechanics that aren't nauseating, even with the speeds and heights.

In the single player game I forgot it was a game with something to do other then zoom around in the  SpiderMan/IronMan   love child that my character was.!!  Then it was  even better!   I write this BEFORE even trying the multi player but I have already told 2 of my friends to get it ASAP so we can play together!

2022-05-28 18:50:14.278523,IanTLopp,If Spiderman and Iron Man had a baby,"Cons:
Okay, yes, I'm starting this review off with cons. Everyone starts with pros, as if that's what we want to see or hear. If I want to try something new, I like to see the negative reviews to see just what I won't like about it. I already know what I want out of it, so I need the cons.
Cons:
Only up to 4 players
No PvP
Controls take some getting used to, and no way to change them without third party hacks
Graphics are basic
No Level/world editor - yet
Lack of content (let me explain)

Pros:
Forget all that - this is fun.
This game is incredibly fun.
OH MY GOD IT'S FUN!!

In all seriousness, this game has been my most incredible adventure in VR to date. I've logged over 40 hours in steam, and another 10 in Oculus home, and I plan to do at least that much more doing speedruns. It's fair to say I've ""done"" everything this game has to offer, but I have so much more I can do to enjoy it.

So I said this game has a lack of content, but that is purely because I want more of this game. I've put so much time and energy into it, and I'm still having so much fun playing it, but I just crave more.

All of the gripes above are minor quibbles. Master Indie is going to keep developing and giving us more in the months to come, so I have so little to really complain about. It's been an amazing rush, and it will continue to be so for many many more hours. I gave this game 5 stars, and it has earned every one of them twice over. If nothing else happens with this game, it's worth every penny, and every star it gets from every reviewer.

So, yes, I got this game for free as a beta tester, but it's completely worth the $20 it's priced at. 

I've drug my whole VR rig to a convention, to friends' houses, to parties, JUST to show off this game. Because in the end, the ONLY real con is that this game is almost unknown. There's no advertising. 

I got Jet Island for free, but my cost is in making sure as many other people know about this as possible. Hope to see you soon!","Sep 23, 2018 at 12:21 AM",5, 19,

2022-05-28 18:50:17.393192,phillip2101,Good But Lacking,"Okay, let me just say that this game is an absolute BLAST to play. Jetting all over the place and swinging around like spider man is where I got the majority of my enjoyment from the game. The music is great, and the boss battles are really fun, although not all that challenging. There is no death, worst case scenario you land in water or spikes and get sent back to your last checkpoint, but other then that there isnt any  punishment. All guns do is push you away and undo your hooks. There is no mode for challenges, all of that must come from your own imagination. Content wise there isnt much to do, Im the type of gamer that buys a game and sinks hundreds of hours into it, so games like this that end up being short lived dont seem as worth it. Despite all this though, I can see myself going back to it over and over, especialy when the game recieves updates. Hopefully over time more bosses are added, maybe new weapons and upgrades, game modes, pvp, ect. There are quie a few gliches, I found myself clipping through the game world many times, in the case of the last boss battle it was easily repeatable and exploitable even.  The LARGEST iossue I have withthe game as of right now is that there is co-op, but every time I search for a game nothing is ever found, and every time I start a session I never seem to have anyone join my game. This may be due to it beuing new, or maybe my system has some fatal flaw, but I cvannot get multiplayer to work at all. 

Overall the game is a blast to play but runs out of steam rather quickly and is lacking in things to do in the world, but the overall experience is worth the cost and with hopes of additional content in the future it is definitely worth the money.","Oct 17, 2018 at 4:30 AM",4, 3,

The feeling of scale , the speed, fluidity and method of movement are absolutely exceptional.

This is also the first VR game i have been playing nonstop since I got it, and keep going back to even if it's just to try another few insane stunts.

It also somehow manages to induce zero motion sickness even though you can move so fast. I really think the dev deserves to be supported and hope that he will continue  to support this title.

I bought this game, amazing by the way...give it a shot!, and am impressed with it all the way around.  Where my issue lies is multiplayer.  I had a friend buy this on steam and when we went to hook up he couldn't see my games and I couldn't see his.  When he looked at online co-op he saw several games being played, when I looked on the oculus side of things there were no games being played to join...even though through steam he saw 7...I created a game and asked him to see if he could see it, which he could not...so I took the next step and this one helps the developers in the short term, but will hurt them with less tolerant people....I bought the game again on steam...went into the game and sure enough I too could see several games being played to join...as it stands, at least for my experience, you cannot join together if you buy this on different platforms...please fix this as it may not have deterred me from playing with my friend, but for others they will instantly refund this...this would be such a shame as this game is REALLY GOOD!","Oct 7, 2018 at 11:35 PM",5, 2,

My Thoughts:

My 1st 20 mins with this game and I hated it.

I could not get to grips with the controls so I asked around on the forums for some tips.
On my 2nd attempt at the game I had a much better time.

Jet Island feels like a futuristic Tony Hawks with slingshot mechanics.
See my 1st impressions video (Above) to see how I get on and defeat one of the 4 bosses.

2022-05-28 18:50:20.561718,JessXe,Pure Fun!!,The best thing about Jet Island is the amazing sense of speed and flow using the combination of the grappling hooks and jet packs. The rope of the grappling hook will actually wrap around objects that it comes into contact with which makes for some very interesting and realistic feeling physics. There is a slight beginning learning curve before you start to feel really good and appreciate what you can do. This is some of the most fun I've ever had in VR. Keep up the amazing work Master Indie!! And thank you for all the work you've already put into this thing.,"Sep 23, 2018 at 6:14 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:50:20.577675,CleanHands_,Such an amazing game and experience.,"This is the first review I have ever written for an Oculus game, just because I need to give this game positive feedback. If you have so called ""VR legs"" and don't get motion sick in VR games, in my opinion, this is a must have in your library.

Once you have about 20-30 min. of gameplay and practice in the open world, that's when the real fun begins. You can use a combination of your hand-mounted grappling hooks and jets to propell yourself up structures, across the terrain, and swing over ravines. This is the most immersive and superhero-like game I've ever played. If you have a spare $20, purchase this game.","Oct 8, 2018 at 2:06 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:50:20.593633,Kryllic,Hidden Gem,"I honestly don't know what it is about this game. It's got basic game mechanics, the world isn't *that* large, there's no story, characters, or clear objective, the world is random and abstrac with no discernable ""layout"", and the graphics aren't even that good...

...Yet, out of the dozens of VR games I have, I find myself playing THIS game for hours, and still wanting to hop back on after a break.

Ok, seriously though, this game is a LOAD of fun. Despite what I mentioned above, the game mechanics are a blast. Soaring through the air at high speeds, using your grapples like spiderman, and your rockets to gain that huge height boost, you could just go on and on, it's practically addicting. The abstract world just adds to the fun, like how skaters love those make-shift skate parks.

And, after playing a few hours, you quickly come to find, there actually are objectives. These weird Descent-like ships that have blue crystals on their backs you gotta shoot. Not only that, but there are towers that have an underground sections with obsticle rooms and traps, and an even bigger boss at the end.

So, if you wanna enjoy the absolute rush of flying through the air on a hoverboard at top speeds, exploring a weird world with even weirder bosses, and getting lost in a fun game for hours without realizing how long it's been, definitely get this game!","Oct 7, 2018 at 1:51 PM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 18:50:20.633526,ccdeltabeta,Jet Moto Mission Mode for PS1 in VR,"This initial review is based solely on learning the mechanics of the game in Single Player Mode.
What a unique game. It presents something new, with game mechanics that compliment the uniqueness of the game.  I make the PS1 Jet Moto comparison because in Jet Moto you are on a hoverbike with multiple ways to control your hoverbike; in this game you are on a hoverboard controlled by limited power/range jet packs on your arms. You also come equipped with a Batman-like grapple gun that by itself is not very useful, but when used in conjunction with the jet pack/hoverboard you can reach new places not obtainable by using either seperately.  Using the grapple gun also gives you a Spider-Man capability to move around (like grappling a column to boomerang yourself around).
Your wrist jet packs have limited range/power, but recharge.  Stopping yourself can be done in multiple ways: grapple, jet pack in reverse direction, or remove your hoverboard from underneath. If you want to completely stop, make sure you are on level ground, else you might find yourself sliding down a hill/slope.
The scale of the game appears to be massive, especially when you look towards the sky and say ""I've got to get up there?!"".  The openess of the environment is incredible; the main gripe I have is that from a distance, certain parts of the environment appears almost 2D, but the closer you get to your target, there is no doubting the 3D.
The graphics are very basic, with not a lot of texture; in some ways it reminds me of the overall appearance of the game Bound on PSVR. Some of the graphics, however, do remind me of Jet Moto.  However, for myself, thje gameplay far outways any graphical limitations.
The game does allow for both snap and smooth turning.  The overall layout of the controls are adequate, but under pressure I found the closeness of the A/B and X/Y buttons troublesome.
All this yaking, and I haven't even gotten to the main campaign; which is why at time I am giving it 3 stars.","Sep 22, 2018 at 3:12 PM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 18:50:23.734233,nrosko,Silver Surfer,"Only played 1 player so far. 
It works brilliantly, i think the difficulty curve is just right, so far at least it feels like a new sport i need to master but its a fun sport. 
I really quite liked the setting & retro graphics, i'm so glad it looks like it does rather than some generic cartoony look. I think this game has a lot of potential to do well if it could be ported over to upcoming santa cruz. 
Only gripe about graphics is sky is a bit low res & flat. 
Music is great maybe i will grow bored of it but so far it works. 
I hope there is some modding for this game in the future.

2022-05-28 18:50:23.750190,jwb1971,What a hidden gem!,"This is a great game - I cannot overstate that enough. Once you get used to the physics and controls the sense of speed and freedom is awesome. Everything is rendered in at the same time... you look across a vast world and slide and fly to your hearts content. Want to take on a boss and really know what the word HUGE means? Want to just do awesome tricks and shoot up the side of a half-pipe at 500 MPH only to turn around at the apex and see your smoke trail 400 feet long below you? Hell yes you do! 
I don't say this for every VR game... but this one really stays with you after you leave VR. It has that kind of effect. Props to the developer (one single dude!) and here's hoping he does well with this game and continues to build it out over time. And bring it to the Oculus Quest! If you can :-)
