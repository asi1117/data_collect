2022-05-28 19:11:56.478604,tkdmaster59,Love this game,"I’m new to online gaming. I love the total immersion and the tension of the fast paced action. Games are short and you can play one after another. So you can play for 10-15 minutes if you want, but 3-4 hours fly by for me.","Jul 17, 2020 at 3:18 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:11:56.493564,FluffyRed,Worth the $,"I like that I can pick this up and play for 5 minutes when I have time to spare, and that there are many options of game play (kill zombies/bomb mode/etc etc) I am confused about the tournament; twice I have come in the top 10, which according to the screen means I should be winning $20-but I don't see where I have received any prize money. Are they paying in Airranger $$? The game also glitches once in awhile, but that could be due to my connection. Also agree about the scoring being wonky-but not really a reason not to play.. Hoping the developers come up with more maps soon, and that more people enter the game. The AI's are tough, but have found human opponents are definitely a better challenge.","Jun 2, 2020 at 1:45 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:11:56.508524,pulliam013,Soooooo overlooked.,"This game is amazing. Great, simple concept executed very well. Controls take a few games but you will feel right at home in no time. If possible, this game just needs some additional polish on the presentation. Graphics, animations,music, etc. Devs may not have the time and/or resources to provide that. If it does though, man on man this games has a real chance to be special.","Apr 14, 2020 at 9:23 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 19:11:56.537447,bryant.coeling,Addicting,"Airranger is a really fun and fairly easy pick up game. The mechanics are a little confusing and disorienting at first but after a few games you get the hang of it. You can ""fly"" around and use different kinds of bows/swords to fit your own play style. 10 hours played at the time of writing this and Im still enjoying the gameplay. Only negative is some things are a little OP but all in all an enjoyable game.  Just wish it was more popular..","Aug 19, 2019 at 10:06 PM",5, 2,
