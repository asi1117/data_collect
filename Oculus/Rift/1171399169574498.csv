2022-05-28 14:40:07.133497,RuneSR2,Awesome game destroyed and Questified,"Loved the original PCVR version, but devs totally destroyed everything with the recent patches. Now the game looks like a bottom-end low-poly badly textured Quest game. Worst garbage ever. Really sad about this, the original PCVR version was so much better than this. This game is totally dead now.","May 17, 2021 at 4:58 AM",1, 21,

2022-05-28 14:40:07.164414,Malikart,Update :(,"Still a great horror game but loved it the way it was before the update. The old manor has gone, which in my opinion was more intense and scary. The old lobby, the hall with the two fireplaces, the big hall with the gargoyle statues and the creepy sound ... all gone. Hope the developers will add the option to return to the old manor at some point in the future.","Oct 17, 2020 at 5:58 AM",2, 22,
2022-05-28 14:40:07.179374,djpeterson83,Authentic VR Scare,"I consdier myself somewhat of a pro when it comes to haunted house scares.  My family ran a haunted attraction for over 20 years (since I was a child) from our back yard.  Every halloween, we'd scare our local community for a couple of days.  In exchange, they got candy! :)

It's halloween season this 2020 as I write this.  With everybody in lock-down, going to a haunted experience this year is just not feasible.  Thanksfully, Affected has you covered!  It's a great VR experience with ambiance and scares that feel like going through one of those great neighborhood attractions.  It really brings back great memories.  If you're looking for something to make halloween festive this year, give this a shot.  You won't be sorry!","Oct 17, 2020 at 8:51 AM",5, 18,

Update since the game update:
Took a hiatus from VR and came back to the updated version of this. It's good but being able to go back to the old version would be a great option. It was scarier and a good bit more intense. I really miss the level of immersion I felt with the previous house.","Nov 1, 2020 at 11:48 PM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 14:40:10.340004,Satconcook,Cheaper than a hounted house,"6/17/18:This is great to put friends in for the first time. However, don't let others watch the preview screen or all the jump scares will be ruined as once you've seen them once there's not much else to it. The environment is creepy and detailed. The audio keeps you immersed in the game and hides the giggles of the friends watching your reactions. It is about 15 minutes worth of a walk through and now that they have split it into only 2 paths there is no real reason to see what else there is once you've seen both paths. As the jump scare are limited, the rest actually feels a little boring. I could see this becoming a series of Affected: The something else, but seems like moved on to help other companies.

Update:9/5/20 Since their last update, I am truly surprised at the changes. It is practically a different game as the visuals, rooms, audio and lighting have all been changed. The lighting is brighter which helps an issue I had with using the Rift-S or LCD screens to play this game and being to dark to make anything out. The added visuals give a whole lot more atmosphere. There are technically 4 endings, but it is more like 2 paths with a slight variation at the end that all end the same way, as ""no one survives."" Some of the rooms were so drastically changed that I wish there was still a classic path that you could go down. I miss the moon beam coming through the skylight and a few other minor differences. It's still a good haunted house though. The new gauntlet mode gives you a bit of a replay value to try and beat the time as things fall, break jump in front of you. Also, what happened to the creepy tune at the loading screen and the title announcement. I used to have friends freak out at that moment.","Sep 6, 2020 at 11:25 AM",4, 7,

It gives forced scares, but not fear. I found it very generic, but you can have a little fun.
I ask producer to put an option of automatic WalkThrough, as many beginner users fumble with the directional controls. It would be better to automatically go through a path, as if you were floating over something, to be able to better visualize the place.
Another suggestion, also return with the option of the old version, which was more scariest.","Sep 15, 2020 at 9:48 AM",3, 5,Thank you very much for the feedback!

The best about the update is the snap turn option, which reduces nausea. Please make the game remember my options so that I don't need to choose the same option every time. I miss the part where I suddenly went outdoors and then back to the manor. The illogical architecture of the old version reminded me of the Winchester Mystery House, which was awesome.

2022-05-28 14:40:13.506675,jwhit3d,Not pleased with the update,"Let me first say to the devs that I appreciate your team’s efforts and enthusiasm at continually updating your product. That shows you really care. However, this latest update is one that I really can’t get behind, as it fundamentally changes the product I purchased from you in the first place. If the Manor had been like it is now (after the update) back in March, I most likely would not have bought it. The tension is gone, the oppressive atmosphere is gone, the sinister sense of foreboding, like there is some malevolent evil underlying all that opulence, is gone. What’s left is something that wouldn’t feel too far out of place in Disney’s Haunted Mansion.   

Entire areas and rooms that I liked are now gone. The ambient/environmental light has been turned up much too high to the point where flashlights are no longer necessary. The portraits are different (I rather miss the portrait of the young lady that defaced itself in real-time as you watched), I don't recall seeing the warped toys (which were a nice touch, believe me).  

I also wrote a message to the developer's website in an appeal to get back the version I liked so very very much. I'm not sure if they'll see that, so I'm posting here as well. Please let me have back the version of Affected: The Manor for the Rift and Quest that I bought initially, back on March 12th. 

Again, I appreciate all the dev's efforts and enthusiasm in maintaining their product. But this update really isn't one I'd ever want, as I felt the experience was perfect as it was and was already very well pleased with the purchase.","Jul 23, 2020 at 4:05 AM",1, 13,

I initially gave this game 1 star as it did not run on my PC after a while of investigating it turned out the issue was due to citrix being installed on my computer.

Worked fine after i uninstalled that programme, however it is still a bit of a pain to have to uninstall something to play a game.

Overrall the game is a good introduction to VR however graphics are not very nice and it is really short and i did suffer a lot of motion sickness compared to other VR games.

I didnt find it really scary as it was just jumpscares however i undferstand development for VR games are still new to the industry. I would recommend this as a taster for VR, i would recommend this if its on sale for a cheap price as you can complete it within 30 mins on average.","Jul 2, 2020 at 7:14 AM",3, 0,"Hi there, are you still getting this error message?"

It barely has any gameplay though, and while the developers pretend it's a strategy to increase the immersion, it's just plain wrong. There's nothing more immersion-breaking than not being PHYSICALLY in the world. Interactions are important in that regard.

So if you want to buy the game, bear in mind: this is not a game. It's a horror house, and just like a real horror house... you don't get to touch anything :) . Still a very fun experience, totally worth it!","Nov 15, 2019 at 4:05 PM",4, 7,

2022-05-28 14:40:22.969655,xsrvaderx,,"I bought this title for the original Oculus Rift and I thought the ambiance was great. This experience also ran smoothly without any stuttering. 

I wanted to experience this again with the Oculus Rift S, but unfortunately this is far from smooth with the Rift S.

As soon as I make a movement with the touch controller (forward, turning clockwise or counter-clockwise) it does not go smoothly but with small stuttering. very unpleasant experience in this way.
When I stand still and just look around me everything goes smoothly, the image only starts to stutter when using the touch controller.

No ASW switched on, a fixed 80 fps is achieved continuously. Processor load is around 50%.

Someone who also experiences this with the Rift S?

Does the developer perhaps have an answer to this problem?

The graphics are very dated, the 'jump scares' have all been done 100 times in old horror movies, and you can't interact with anything at all.  There is nothing at all unique in this.  If I could give this a zero score, I would.

For the developer: Bring the graphics up to at least 2010 standards  (Example: Books on bookshelves should look like books, not like old wallpaper vaguely resembling a row of books).  Allow interaction with at least one or two items in every 'scarey' area, even if it is just turning a lamp on or off, or something moves so you grab it and a 'ghost' appears.  Allow exploration of the house, not just a predetermined path where you have to follow whatever door opens next.

After a while , as i learned to syncronize the movements with the fingers and sticks, it´s increddible real feeling. But you have to learn to make difference between a head movment and a body movment from hips. If you learn to simulate this ,  its incredibly true feeling. At all it´s a pretty short experience and nearly no way to interact with something, but even of this, the experiance is great and it'S capativating, if you let the immersion happen. Only to suggest: Try to move your legs at the same place and to simulate that with the joystick , also try to compence the head only movement against a full body movement with the stick.

And the most offensive thing I've been waiting for this game since the appearance of the Oculus Rift, wrote to the developers. On the glasses of the previous generation it was a real masterpiece, which skillfully manipulated your fears and stress. Here everything is stretched, slow and expected, not scary. You can easily part with half of senseless adventures, half of unnecessary rooms, with three of four endings and eventually get one full route, and not two trimmed. Feels like an attempt to cash in on the legend of horror in virtual reality. I went to look for ways to run the old version.

2022-05-28 14:40:35.594846,Falcon_DS_,Wasted Opportunity,"Unfortunately this title is not as good as its component parts or the undoubted individual talents of the developers.  The setting is stunning, the atmosphere is perfect and the soundscape is immaculate.  So with all this going for it what is the problem?  Well, this simply translates as a walkthrough of a virtual haunted house at a funfair.  If it had exploration and puzzle elements then the set pieces would have scared me witless because I would not see them coming; as it is you are simply waiting for the next jump scare and there is no sense of horror at all.  If this had been in the same vein as the Paranormal Activity or Don’t Knock Twice games then it would have stood head and shoulders above them; but due to the simple walkthrough experience that it is, there is simply nothing to build the tension leading up to the jump scares.  Oh, and if your head movement had been independent to your direction of travel instead of controlling it, the experience would have been much better too.  Most games use the controller direction as your direction of travel allowing you to look around freely in any direction while walking in a straight line; if you look at an adjacent wall while walking down a corridor in this game you will end up walking into it.  Overall, a very unfortunate wasted opportunity.  One to scare your grandma with perhaps, but not yourself…","Jan 2, 2018 at 5:54 AM",3, 6,

The original Affected demo was more immersive, there were more lights so you could enjoy the rooms and ignore the pixels. As the graphics are beautiful, why don't you show them more clearly ? The darkness can be scary when it is used wisely, not permanently. Affected contains lots of scary moments based on ""surprise"". Surprise also works in day light ! Switching off the light can be scary if there were lights ON before ! Human eyes adjust what they see in the dark. If the dark is permanent, your eyes start to see the pixels backlight.

The Jump scares are cheap and predictable. I wasn't scared at all .. not that I thought i'd be .. it felt like some kind of fair ground ghost ride. I'm not saying it was terrible, just a bit obvious and the lack of variation within the place, or the ability to walk faster is kinda meh!

That being said it's a decent concept and it's been executed competetantly enough .. I would just like to see a little more interaction and some puzzles to solve. It's too much like an on the rails tour of a carnival ghost house at present. But I don't regret buying it .. it's pretty cheap and demonstates the creators abilities well for what it is.

Nit-picking: Not god ray friendly at all but I get it - it's dark and lights are bright. Hard to avoid. But menus are bad too. And where are my hands?

2022-05-28 14:41:10.290943,HiThere_,My best VR horror experience,"The bad :
- Since the early beta, the jumpscares do seem to have been toned down : Their close ups are less ""in your face"", and their sounds are less intent on ""blasting your ears off"".
- You have to hold the Touch controller in gun position (like holding a gun in Dead and Buried), if you hold the Touch controller as if you were holding a torch, your virtual torch will be pointing 90° down towards the floor : They should either tilt the virtual Torch 90° up, or change the shape of the torch to a rectangular torch (or a smartphone), to achieve the correct real-life hand position while holding the torch.
- There's plenty of clipping if you go look for it, but none to complain about if you aren't trying to.

The good :
- Runs fine on my Windows7/i5-2500K/GTX970 at it's default settings.
- Touch support : It's just for the torch, which is fine and leaves the left hand free for controlling body movement.
- There is NO TELEPORTATION : Teleportation needs to die, there's no amount of immersion teleportation mechanics can't kill.

I enjoyed walking up and down the hallways slowly, taking in the pictures and sounds. I felt about as immersed as I have with any experience thus far. It was a nice treat for me as I'm entirely unfamiliar with Affected. The $7.99 price tag also makes this an easy purchase.

Honestly at one point I wanted to take my headset off and another I was on my knees with my head in my hands not wanting to carry on, it's horrible and will scare you half to death.  Don't listen to any bad reviews, if ppl are having issues running it then i'm sorry but this is nothing to do with the devs, it's flawless on my 980 and there is nothing out at the minute that is so scary and amazing at this time and these guys have got much more to come!! absolutely brilliant!!","Mar 18, 2017 at 8:09 AM",5, 2,

It's ok for the price but honestly I regret buying. Personally I wouldn't pay more than 4 bucks for it now that I know what it is. It is not that scary. There are some jump scares with no story, and very little interaction. Just a tour. This feels very dated to me. I love horror games, re7 was great, and layers of fear was one of my favorites.","Mar 15, 2017 at 11:48 AM",2, 2,

2022-05-28 14:41:16.648591,Metalsech,"The Good, The Bad and The Scary","A review by someone extremely familiar with Affected on DK2: Awesome to see Affected fianally arrive on CV1 with Touch control implemented. If you've played it before you know what to expect from this so lets skip over that. So what's good? Well its certainly longer than the original manor by about two times. It has better choices for different routes which is great for multiple playthroughs. It has brand new jumpscares and moments never seen before which are amazing, especially loved the elevated ramp (you'll see). The touch controls with the torch work well. Visuals are crisper and have had an upgrade. So what's not so good? Firstly the end jump scare has been for some reason nerfed and not made as close up as before which was a real let down. I have no idea why on earth they felt the need to change this for the worst. It was just not as jumpy and in your face. Its a pity that the torch wasn't interactive and you couldn't switch it on and off at will. Again I felt this was an odd decision. Also in the original for free you had 3 different experiences to try out, where as in this its just the one, albeit greatly enhanced. The scary? All of it. Seriously this is the best horror experience on CV1 so far, whether you've played it before or not.","Mar 13, 2017 at 1:02 AM",5, 2,

Eventually after mucking around with drivers and reinstalling things with no improvement. Turning off oculus audio mirroring helped it load only sometimes.

2022-05-28 14:41:19.834156,Sheeplovsky,,"I am surprised to find out, that the official CV1 version of the manor is a completely remake of the DK2 version. I like the new visuals. Also the different paths you can choose now. And that it is darker again. But somehow I found it less scary than the original version. 

I think one problem is that too much is happening now. The player steps in a room and is in constant awareness that something will happen; and in most cases it will. The original manor had only a small amount of jump scares, but they were very well placed. So after passing a few rooms the player felt safe, just to experience the next shock effect coming out of nowhere, which gave it a higher impact. The 2nd issue with the remake is the music, which is well done and atmospheric like in a horror movie , but it also is too much in my opinion. 
The original manor had a very silent soundtrack that worked better towards scaring the player.
Nevertheless, Affected The Manor is still the best Horror Experience on the Rift for me. I am looking forward to your next releases!","Mar 10, 2017 at 8:39 AM",5, 2,

I took a point off as I think it needs more human form scares...those in these type of games are TERRIFYING...such as when in that other horror demo, elevator ritual...there is a scene where a dead woman slowly shambles toiwards you from down a darkened hallway.....my jaw dropped and and was freaking out at the terror of she was on her way and she looked dead scary. more of that needs to be in this game otherwise, this is a wonderful demo, grab it to show off VR to friends!   oh, BTW...thanks for regular locomotion which this game has...I HATE teleporting.HATE IT!  teleporting dilutes the power and point of VR.

i am not saying its not worth buying though. 

its a shame a lot of the jump scenes are kind of obvious they are about to happen, they lack that POW factor.. there are one or two moments that do catch you off guard though. 
i had to giggle to myself when i got caught out.. 
i think the control method could be tweaked a little, i will admit i am not sure what to suggest to improve it. 
its good and all, but it needs something slightly different to the way you navigate the house.

The timing and suspense aren't quite right to be truly scary. Even the jump scares are predictable, and that's the cheapest and easiest way to scare the player. I wasn't really expecting a story of any sort, and there definitely isn't one.  The game does look pretty nice and shows off what's visually possible to achieve in vr horror.
