2022-05-28 18:21:47.237222,pdog2,Disappointing,"There really isn't much to do here. You're above the ground, looking down from a hot air balloon. You can't go any closer to anything on the ground so it's just a bird's eye view the entire time. You can click on the map to teleport to different places but it's pretty limited. There is a recorded explanation for each place but I didn't find anything I really wanted to hear about. I thought this would be more interactive but it isn't at all. I don't want to look from above in a stagnant place, either.","Dec 2, 2018 at 5:24 AM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 18:21:47.252182,kemcclin,Archaeologist Approved,"I took a six-week long summer school course in Rome in 2016, in which we learned about the topography and history of Rome. There was so much to learn and absorb; it would have been so great to have an app like this to review the content we learned on site after returning home. Beyond that, it is also now fantastic to be able to explore the site remotely while back in the States, when one gets Rome sick. Highly recommend for digital tourist or teaching purposes!","Nov 21, 2018 at 7:12 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:21:47.268139,PoolfanVr,Do not expect Google Earth VR,"I have been interested in Rome since visiting 10 years ago and remember efforts to create a virtual Rome back then.  This still feels like a work in progress. Do not expect a version of Ancient Rome with a Google Earth VR feel to it.

Basically. you select a part of ancient Rome and are teleported there - sitting high above the city in a hot air balloon.  You are in a fixed position, you cannot move, zoom in or out - you then listen to a detailed narration of the area you have selected. That is it in a nutshell

So there is no use of VR whatsoever - I guess you do get an idea of the scale of things from your fixed position but thats it as far as VR goes. What a waste of a medium.

The graphics are really poor, very simplistic to say the least and add to the disappointment. 

Having said all of this the narration is interesting and as you listen you do feel that the view over Ancient Rome adds a little to the experience but this could and should be a lot better from a VR perspective and I hope this gets developed further with the right VR expertise behind it.

One last point, I purchased this on sale at £3.99 - the price of a couple of Esspressos in Rome and at that price level, if you have a genuine interest in ancient Rome it is a still a very worthwhile purchase.  So for the price I paid 3 stars.","Sep 10, 2018 at 5:13 AM",3, 13,"We couldn't agree more with you. As you can imagine, Rome Reborn VR is an enormous urban model with lots of geometry, textures, and several LODs. It is only because of circumstances beyond our control that we are unable to offer our users the same pleasure we ourselves enjoy in our office of being able to move freely through virtual Rome. But, be assured: this is a high priority for us, so please stay tuned! 

We have made our apps available now as 360 panoramas on the theory that ""something is better than nothing"" and so that we can begin to build a Rome Reborn community and get reactions and suggestions from users like you about new features you would like to see us offer. We will be taking on board your ideas and suggestions to the greatest extent possible. In the meantime, you can help get us to the day when free roaming is possible by buying our apps now and by spreading the word about Rome Reborn VR. Thank you!

2022-05-28 18:21:47.284096,FolkSong,Missed Opportunity,"This app has one thing going for it, which is an accurate and detailed model of ancient Rome. I read up on the Rome Reborn project and it's a serious academic effort that has been going on for many years. Unfortunately this VR app seems like they are just trying to capitalize on the model with minimal effort.

The whole app consists of picking a random topic from a list, at which point you are teleported to a random location, where you sit motionless in the air and listen to some history about the area. The history is good, but it's all so disconnected. 

At the very least I expected some kind of guided tour where you float around the city and learn about the structures as you pass them. And the ability to fly freely around the model doesn't seem like too much to ask either. As of now there's not much point in this being a VR app, you could just look at a picture while listening to the narration and have the same experience.

Update: after further reflection I've updated my review to 3 stars rather than 2, but only because I support what they're doing. At this point purchasing the game should be considered as partially a donation to the project.","Sep 16, 2018 at 4:20 AM",3, 14,"Thank you very much for taking the time to use and review our application!

2022-05-28 18:21:47.299056,SACB221,Roman Archaeology - Digital Version,"I am a graduate student in Roman Archaeology, soon to graduate and begin a career in academia. It is so exciting to see tools like this being developed that I can use in the classroom. The content for this app is first rate, and exhaustively researched. Other such apps may crop up, but I highly doubt any will be so carefully produced by actual scholars in the field. Highly recommend this app to instructors at the collegiate and secondary school levels!","Nov 21, 2018 at 7:02 PM",5, 2,

I often introduced education computer games into her curriculum, to add some variety into the types of challenges she encountered. Rome Reborn is an excellent modern version of the same idea, but much more immersive and engaging for a young audience. I so wish I had had something like this when I was teaching! Nevertheless, it's great to get to enjoy it now.","Nov 21, 2018 at 6:46 PM",5, 1,
