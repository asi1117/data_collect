It's a little limited on songs with basically one song with different transitions "" bass line, melody, drums, ..."" per map with just 2 maps. So you will probably be sick of the songs after a few play throughs but you have a bunch of other things going on at the party to play with.  It is a awesome feeling when you get the party going and is worth every penny!","Feb 18, 2020 at 12:21 PM",5, 1,
