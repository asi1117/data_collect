2022-05-28 19:21:42.451337,ji_zhao,RECOMMAND,"Plain UI interface, but the function is better than any other VR player because it can play 5K",Apr 30 at 6:56 PM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:21:42.465299,DeafeningSeal,Great compatibility.  Needs tweaking.,"I downloaded this solely because my other video player couldn't play all codecs.  This one plays pretty much everything.  

One thing I wish it had is an easy to access tilt function.  On other players, you can tilt the camera up and down using the controller.  Would really be nice.  

Also, I would recommend a better graphic designer.  The UI appearance looks amateurish.  If you had a strong artist on the team, I think this app could rise to the top.",Sep 5 at 2:14 AM,4, 8,
2022-05-28 19:21:42.481257,Rickerized,This VR player plays all VR videos.,"There are so many VR players out there, but none of them seem to play all different formats (codecs)

This player seems to play all of them without stuttering.

Excellent!","Mar 11, 2021 at 10:49 PM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 19:21:42.510179,sportslayer,"Good for local, lacks 2d-3d conversion",Great for local playback. only feature missing for me is on the fly 2d-3d conversion (this was possible on PowerDVD 3d back in 2010 and many desktop players since). So far havent found a single VR player with this option,"Nov 20, 2020 at 12:36 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 19:21:45.631830,BananaCat,Works great for local playback,"I usually use Whirligig and Devo but they seem to lag with 5-8 k videos. This mermaid player plays them without stuttering. So that is a bonus. I only really use vid players for local playback. Have not tested out the other features like youtube and stuff.  
With all the different codecs out now and new tech it seems we need multiple players to play everything. This seems to play the most without any hiccups or stutters but lacks some features for fine tuning. Other then that is is pretty solid. Thanks.","Aug 11, 2020 at 10:56 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 19:21:45.646790,JackTripper5555,Only worked once,"Had such promise too, but the buttons became unresponsive and it never worked again after the first time. I downloaded a bunch of suff to watch as well only for it to fail miserably at go time.","Dec 13, 2020 at 9:14 PM",1, 0,

2022-05-28 19:21:48.780409,reach4thelasers,Didn't work,I got nowhere with this app.  It loaded into an underwarer scene.  I could see  my controllers with button labels.  Tried all the buttons but nothing seemed to do anything.  Gave it a minute then quit.  I will be uninstalling right after I write this.,"Dec 30, 2019 at 6:34 AM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 19:21:48.795369,Templar01,Sighhhh!!! Yet another untested product.,"This product is half-baked. I'm glad I didn't pay for it. On the web page it lists Netflix and Youtube. In both cases I received ""Browser not supported"" errors.

Yet just one more in a string of work-in-progress software science projects that rely up us, the user community, to test their software for them. Hmmmm I wonder if we'll get paid for our efforts? :)","Mar 24, 2019 at 4:21 PM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 19:21:48.809331,Kasaiya,Great,I love this!! The only thing i would really love even more if somehow you could get netflix to support this! That would be amazing and it would then be perfect for me.,"Mar 10, 2019 at 2:59 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 19:21:48.825289,frapop,,Works great. Only thing I miss is a button for a fast recentering and a tab control within the browser everything else nice work.,"Jan 3, 2019 at 12:02 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 19:21:48.839251,rrellis,"Works pretty well, missing a few things","A pretty good viewer for viewing local and internet movie content. I thought the interface was intuitive enough and I could locate, and view content pretty easily. The ability to handle top/bottom videos worked, but in 360 mode, I couldn't get stereo 3D which a few of my local GoogleVR Jump videos to work. It seemed to show 3d stereo if in 180 mode, but not 360.  Overall, pretty good though!","Sep 23, 2018 at 9:16 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 19:21:51.945942,mreid13,,"Works great. My only complaint is it doesn't seem to be possible to sort local files based on either length, date added, modified, ect. that would be a welcome addition.","Sep 12, 2018 at 8:48 AM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 19:21:51.976859,IbegU2Rift,,"Overall a nice app, great quality on local streamed movies.
But impossible to stream anything above 360p from the internet, im on 100/100 bit line.

Again, i'm on a 100/100 line, and can stream 4k or any other resolution from the websites with no trouble, but it's hard even in 480p in your app. So do the math =)","Jun 21, 2018 at 3:25 PM",2, 2,"about the stream video, we suggest you can download the video directly. not every website supported user watch 360 video online.
Thank you for your comment, we will keep fix and improve our app. ; )"
2022-05-28 19:21:51.997804,Malkevin,Great and easy to use,"A really simple to use but still feature rich, has almost everything I'd want from a VR player, it even has a built-in web browser. 

I'd give it five stars if you could bookmark folders for ease of access between sessions, and an option to change the horizontal angle to make bed time viewing more comfortable.","May 23, 2018 at 1:47 AM",4, 1,"Thank you for your supporting!! The horizontal angle seems we could finish it next version, but about the bookmark folders, I still not got your point. do you need a bookmark for website or for local videos?
Thank you for your suggestion, and hope you would enjoy MermaidVR"
2022-05-28 19:21:52.017751,innovacy,Playing local files?,"Somehow I only got into that browser/video platform selection screen and I don't see or find how I can play local files. Is that even possible at all?

But also online, not much for me to do here, I cannot switch those streams to other viewing modes or such, it's just a browser more or less fixed with little adjustment options...","Aug 19, 2018 at 6:53 PM",2, 0,

2022-05-28 19:21:55.126436,ronice06,spectacular 3-d player!,"A ton of available options. Everything from brightness & contrast to setting the aspect ratio. Supports side by side  & over under 3d. Supports 180 & 360 degree video and most popular video formats. It has a variety of selectable backgrounds. You can view You Tube and other online video providers. The only con I can think of is that the interface is a little clunky. Accessing your video folders requires a double click with your Oculus controller. That aside, it's a small annoyance compared to the overall package. It blows away the software that I just *paid for in features alone!","May 4, 2018 at 9:28 AM",5, 1,"Thank you so much!! Hope you will enjoy MermaidVR. 
I am agrees with you that interface is a little clunky. trust me, we are trying to make it better, but we need money or AD work to support that. As a free VR video player. we just try our best to do it. Thank you for your 5 stars. Thank you for your supporting, we will keep going!!
Hope you keep support us!!Have a nice day!"

But we support the rift controllers, and our description had said that, Xbox controller not support for the moment, and actually if you got a rift controllers, it will be easy to use. anyway, we will try to support touch controllers and xbox controller, but pls give us more time to rebuild it.

2022-05-28 19:21:58.307926,berickphilip,Nice screen setup but washed out colors,"Youcan choose to make the screen a bit curved like on big movie theaters, that is nice.
The 3D effect for SBS videos is more pronounced than on DeoVR, and I was impressed by that, and it was also very nice.
But the colors are washed out, sadly.","Sep 11, 2017 at 1:15 AM",3, 2,"About the color of video, it is depends on the video clips, if you feel the colors like washed out, please send us the video file by email: memaidvr2017@hotmail.com; help us to analysis this problem."
