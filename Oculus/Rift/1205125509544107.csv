vSpatial is a cross-platform application and has features that require you have an account for security reasons. We want to ensure that if you're using our application to connect to your devices over the internet that you have a secured and encrypted account. Or if for using our collaboration features. Claiming that we ask for your email to spam you is completely false. We'd love for you to still check out the app, just know that because of the feature set that we have, an account is required.

Thanks,

After using the vSpatial application for several hours, it was exciting to realize that my need for a functional virtual work space for business professionals has been realized. The capability to hold meetings and collaborative working sessions in my vSpatial work space, is an added plus. 

Using a clever 'hack', I'm able to engage voice-to-text translation in my VR workspace, to manage the majority of my data entry needs. The virtual keyboard helps with quick-editing voice-entered text; everything else that I need presently is available in my vSpatial virtual workspace.

As with other such programs one of my biggest turn offs is a ""too busy"" environment or one that is inconsistent/inappropriate for me & my workers.  The current office is not particularly ""professional"" and I'd be uncomfortable bringing a customer in to such an environment.  Can the user opt for a simple solid color background (perhaps of their choice?)?  Does the virtual desk in front of the user actually DO anything? -- I'd like the ability to hide/remove it.  How about bringing IN external objects/props?","Jul 5, 2019 at 7:31 AM",4, 1,"Hi jedwards123321,

Thanks for the great suggestions, originally we had some ideas on using the table for some upcoming features, but we'll certainly look at enabling a toggle to turn off and on the table. We're also already working on an API that can let you the user update the space to an area of your choice or to switch through some pre-made ones.

Some of the windows calls that we make to move screens around your desktop can be flagged by some anti-virus software. It can take a large number of safe installs before some of these anti-virus software companies mark software as safe. In the meantime, we've updated our app signing that should hopefully help with these calls so give it a try and let us know if it's still being flagged. Could you also include the name of the anti-virus software you use for us so we can contact them and try and figure something out? You can email me directly at daniel@vspatial.com

Thanks for the positive review. We're happy you're digging everything so far. Input to this day has been a hot topic in VR and something we've been exhausting a lot of resources on.

2022-05-28 18:07:31.204802,Destroyer5,Privacy-They will share what you do.,"I think there should be more transparency when it comes to sharing what i view.  Read 3.2 Its states that you give vSpatial (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations, or other changes we make so that your Content works better with our Services.  Not good at all.","Feb 27, 2018 at 11:50 AM",1, 11,"Admittedly, the original T&Cs were modeled after some of the other very large companies that we all use day-to-day.  We agree that there definitely needs to be more transparency and limitations and are committed to doing so as we approach a production status.  In our current beta stage (and as a small company) we are still deriving the things that are useful for product improvement and those things that fall strictly into the privacy category."

However, I'm finding the integration with Touch isn't there yet. Notably, selection doesn't seem to properly interact with Hangouts, Chrome browser, or mixed controls in general. Although typing on the in-app keyboard works, with niether Touch nor keyboard+mouse combination was I able to swap active tabs or control streaming videos. 

I look forward to these issues being solved, I really love the layout here. 
Other nice-to-haves would include rearranging windows on the carousel (for example, in a cluster instead of a horizontal layout).","Feb 9, 2018 at 3:41 AM",3, 0,Touch integration is an area of focus for us.

2022-05-28 18:07:31.235719,NoSuchHuman,,"As others have said, great concept, but needs a lot of work.

2022-05-28 18:07:34.347396,rbuccigrossi,Key Features Make vSpatial Promising,"When I first got my Oculus Rift, I had a dream of ridding myself of my monitor and working in a vast virtual landscape. However, while the Rift's resolution is great for games, I suddenly become aware of its limits when dealing with a virtual monitor (say in Virtual Desktop, BigScreen, or MultiVR.se).  Instead of using a large virtual monitor, vSpatial creates a carousel of open windows, so all windows are detatched and visiable at once. Its interface allows you to quickly resize or isolate the focused window (to aid in legibility), which makes it vSpatial uniquely usable for reading in a multi-window environment.

Feature Requests: Once I got used to the interface, I found myself using my regular keyboard instead of the virtual one, which led me to greatly desire key shortcuts for switching between windows. Then, I wanted to also be able to use my physical mouse within a window (instead of switching back and forth between the keyboard and the touch controller). The physical mouse actually worked, but the pointer didn't display. So if the pointer could be made visible for a second if the physical mouse was moved, that would open vSpatial for use with email, word processing, and other keyboard/mouse sensitive apps.","Nov 28, 2017 at 8:11 AM",5, 16,"Hi rbuccigrossi,

Thanks for the feedback! Reviews like this are especially useful as we get to better know some of the pain-points of working in VR.

Instead of recenter all the experience you could use buttons/analogsticks to move our virtual ""chair"". Videos and games need better performance. Would be nice to have different keyboard and tablet styles or even give to the users de chance to build their own tablet/keyboard like a lego toy.","Oct 20, 2017 at 10:21 AM",4, 11,"Thank you for your great feedback Onko!  1) Hints are now in the latest version!  2) We agree that re-centering is not ideal when it comes to adjusting position of the desk and carousel with respect to the user.  We've considered allowing chair movement, but that has some implications regarding the carousel sphere.  Currently, the angular curvature is optimized with the camera at the center so that all images and text have the same size and appearance.  Still working this one.  3) There are two performance choices presently (that's the turtle/rabbit icon).  The fast performance runs games and video fine, but is not backward compatible with all hardware (notably, laptops that pass the GPU through the embedded VPU).  On the aforementioned laptops, it will be grayed out.  We're working to automate this so the fast performance is chosen when possible.  4) Like your suggestion regarding keyboard/tablet styles."
2022-05-28 18:07:34.378314,Symon_231,Not good enugh even as early access,"I love the idea and the approach taken by the developers in trying to make the windows individual screens. However, there are just so many bugs that this cannot be considered good even for an early access. During the tutorial I could not press the next button in multiple occasions, it was like something was overlaying it. The same thing happened with the main menu where you can select the application to show as screens. I'm always so surprise to see that developers don't care at all about what they are releasing, the idea is good but the application clearly needs some work.","Dec 8, 2017 at 2:33 AM",2, 0,"Since this initial comment, we have had several releases that address many of the issues herein described.

The interface is clunky beyond clunky, and the windows it puts in front of you it forces into smaller windows on the primary monitor.  The whole point of this would be practically infinite display space - but you smush everything down so it's in one monitor???  My workstation has 8 1080p displays, so this setup felt utterly clostraphobic to me.  I'd sooner use a laptop.","Oct 22, 2017 at 7:42 AM",1, 5,"Thank you IPwnNoobs for your feedback of our early access software.  We're addressing several UX issues in the next few versions including moving away from button presses in carousel management in favor of touch controller manipulation.  With respect to the app window size, the current version is relative to monitor resolution. One of our next versions changes this to a modified absolute size wherein for lower resolution monitors the large size app window (there are three sizes) will be the size of the monitor; e.g. a 1080P monitor will get a 1920x1080 resolution.  This will be difficult to see detail, but when changing to zoom mode will allow a full and clear view."

2022-05-28 18:07:37.529884,asimura,A Long Way From Being Ready,"It's an exciting concept and one I would love to use. Productivity applications always involve typing. This needs upgrading so that the laser comes out of each index finger so you can at least use two finger typing. Probably better for AR so you can see your real keyboard.

Needs higher resolution headsets. Even with large screen typed words are blurry. The other screens and surroundings disappear when large screen activated.

The feedbackform is abysmal in the questions it asks. Multiple answer ones often are but I am forced to say things I don't really want to say. Put in space for some typed comments or do you not believe your tablet keyboard is good enough.

I like the idea and look forward to the future though.","Oct 26, 2017 at 3:55 AM",1, 1,"Thank you asimura for your feedback.  There is a dual-hand mode for typing that this version has as an experimental mode.  As you hands come close to the keyboard a yellow ball will appear at the position of your index finger knuckle.  Currently, it still requires pressing the 'A' or 'X' button to select the key (we're testing a mode that only requires colliding).  We have found this to be faster and more comfortable than using index finger ray casts, but not as intuitive.  The next version will have bigger app windows with improved readability--and a one button selection to enter into focus mode wherein you can increase the size to a comfortable and readable perspective.
