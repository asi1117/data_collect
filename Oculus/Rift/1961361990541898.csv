2022-05-28 16:43:02.235449,Nitelite666,Not as random as they claim it to be,"Weird how there are certain hotseats on each map if the game is supposed to be a 100% random. Think their RNG needs to be revised. Not saying the game is rigged, just poorly designed.
(Don't need a response on how your RNG was ""certified"" by itech years ago)

Other problems include quite a substantial amount of bugs, that gets reported to discord by multiple people, but rarely get fixed (guess it's more important to add toys, cause that generates revenue)

(I've got over 70k hands played)

A sidenote is that they claim the game is 18+, but if you go to the lower tables, you'll quickly see that's not the case, as the average age is probably around 12. (You can report them for being underage, but nothing will be done about it) Not sure how healthy being introduced to gambling at such a young age is.",3 days ago,1, 1,
2022-05-28 16:43:02.251407,Loganjaman,"Ignore ""Game is Rigged!!11!"" Losers","The game is amazing, you can meet people from all over the world and just talk. I've won multiple hands with a pair of 7s or lower just by bluffing or BS'ing. The game has dealt me some amazing hands and some garbage ones. With the new addition of roulette now we have 4 games to relax and talk to friends in. Honestly all the bad reviews are just angry whiners who have no idea how to actually play poker and blame the game for their terrible skills. 
P.S.
If you find you lose money too quick then dont call bets or raise unless you have decent cards or a good strategy. Be smart and you can play for 5 hours with 5K",4 days ago,5, 0,"Hi Loganjaman, thank you for the awesome and detailed review!

2022-05-28 16:43:02.266367,riverchunk,Hard to believe its not rigged.,"If you like being beat by one outers every second hand or getting beat on the river consistently this game is for you!  Game is not even close to real world poker.  Don't even start with the ""more hands played"" per hour argument.  There appears to be a specific seat at each table that wins every hand regardless of the cards.  All the other players hit as well but the winning hand is always the impossible card.",9 days ago,1, 1,"Hello riverchunk, we’re very sorry to hear about your experience in PokerStars VR.

2022-05-28 16:43:02.282324,VirtUalBaNdit,FIX YOUR BUGS,After losing 9 hands in a row in blackjack I bet my last 1k and DON’T EVEN GET CARDS !!!! The 2 dudes next to me won because the dealer had a soft 17. They accepeted my bet but didn’t deal me any cards. I just lost ! If only that was a rare occurrence but it isn’t. I find myself having the reboot my whole headset because I can’t even join a table too many times. Sports bets not going through … That pretty much explains the level of idgaf the devs have. It’s the 3rd time i uninstalled your game and it will be the last.

But as of today I did send 2 email's to get help, and of this date 5-5 still they have not gotten back to me to help solve anything, and I still not able to use my mic to talk.",23 days ago,1, 1,"Hello jdscheer99, we’re very sorry to hear about your experience in PokerStars VR.
