2022-05-28 17:32:02.186646,SyPh0nTV,Super Chill,"A very good an relaxing way to play chess on VR. The AI is fun an all but it compares nothing to human logic and experience. 
Online matchmaking is a must have IMO, others might disagree but for me its a must.

2022-05-28 17:32:02.201605,Mickpatry,Very good gameplay,"This game is very well thought out - the settings are sumptuous, the boards and pieces are excellent, the gameplay is fast and accurate. The only thing you have to watch is that your piece's exit square is blue when you pick it up, and your destination square is blue when you set it down, otherwise the game loses itself.
Suyitable for beginners especially, but as a reasonable player I've tired of beating it so easily and yearn for an update.  Its openings repertoire seems surprisingly weak, the AI seeks to simplify even if it means losing exchanges, although oddly enough it does come up with some clever ideas in the middle game sometimes. Please let's have a '10' Level that is a 10 Level. Otherwise, extremely well done really.",Nov 29 at 1:11 AM,5, 2,

2022-05-28 17:32:02.246485,wintermuter,Showstopping bugs,"Experiment 7 states on their website that they have ""an uncompromising commitment to product quality"" yet all i see mostly in these reviews are bugs, bugs, and more bugs and frustrated users with showstopping, game-breaking glitches with no response from Experiment 7 at all. So, what you read on their website is basically rhetoric.

I could not complete a game, major glitches when moving a piece. (illegal moves, game stops, could not continue) A real pity, i was enjoying the experience a lot, the environments are simple but well made, and the gameplay itself is satisfying. Just a shame that clearly Experiment 7 have abandonded their users.",Jul 29 at 10:05 PM,2, 4,

For example, I moved my rook into a check position but it did not register.  So the game kept going with out the king getting out of check, and my rook was rendered useless.

However, I am not a phenomenal chess player, but decent, maybe 1600 level.  I don't even need a multiplayer network.  I just want a DECENT AI TO PLAY AGAINST. And the highest level is (10) weak, and falls for material traps in the openings.  This beautiful looking game needs a better chess engine and an opening repertoire that make it more challenging at its highest levels.  You are making this for chess players, too, right?  Too easy to beat outright, plays like my dos computer from 1995.  Absolutely wonderful chess environment, no functional multiplayer except by invite (haven't tried.)

To give an example, I was once checked, but I was still able to move my other pieces. After that, the AI captured my King, but the game just went on. Without my King. I was a little confused to be honest.

But still, most of the time, there are no bugs (even though the AI is too easy), and the game is enjoyable to play!","Aug 12, 2019 at 9:39 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 17:32:18.023290,StormRising,Fulfills your hopes,My wife and I are adved Chess players. We love new chess sets and playing in different envrioments. This game is PERFECT for us to play together in a new setting. All the enviroments are very well modeled and have a relaxing feel. The chess board and pieces are basic but that is to be expected from a free title. The A.I is seriously difficult on higher levels. It plays steady and bug-free for hours on end. There aren't any in-game ads or anboying pop-ups of any sort. It is everything you'd expect from a Chess game without any frills. The quality is top-notch. If you are looking for a Chess game to rely on this is the one. Enjoy!,"Aug 16, 2019 at 6:05 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 17:32:18.040243,ElectrumWhip,"Definitely fun, with a few shortcomings.","First and foremost, let me clarify that this is definitely an enjoyable game, especially considering it's free. It still feels like a bit of a work in progress, though, and I hope this review is useful to the developers if they choose to update it. It's missing a few standard rules (which I'll link to), has a few bugs, and has a bit of room for development when it comes to customization. 

Rules: 
~""Any other physical contact with a piece, except for clearly accidental contact, shall be considered to be intent [and must be moved if a legal move is possible]."" (FIDE 4.2.2). Once a piece is touched, it should be the only possible move. Although I understand if implementing this could be frustrating in VR. 
~""Where a pawn reaches the eighth rank and is replaced by a new queen, rook, bishop or knight of the same colour."" (FIDE 3.7.5.3). Currently, the game defaults promotions to Queen, which may not be the most effective piece in certain circumstances. 
~""A player may claim a draw if the last 50 moves have been completed by each player without the movement of any pawn and without any capture."" (FIDE 5.3.2). 
~""The game is drawn if the last 75 moves have been completed by each player without the movement of any pawn and without any capture."" (FIDE 9.6.2)
~""A player may claim a draw if the same position occurs three times. 2. A game is drawn if the same position occurs five times."" (5.3.1.1-2)
(ref. https://www.fide.com/fide/handbook.html?id=208&view=article )
If you were to be playing with another person, both knowing the rules, this wouldn't be an issue, but it would be nice to have these be configurable for when playing with players / AI. 

Other notes: The AI is fairly easy to beat. It might be worthwhile taking a look into some other chess engines to allow for a bit more of a challenge. A level 7-8 bot shouldn't be losing to anything but forced mates.

Another review said that the ""controls were squirrely, right as I was about to deal the fatal blow"". Those arent squireely controls, thats cheating. The AI cheats so you cant win. I could move any other piece except for my knight. I wasnt in check, and my knight was going to a valid spot.

Needs more enviroments and yet more pieces & boards rather than merely a change of colour/material. Obviously more music choices as well as our own music playlists for both to share. The menu needs an auto hide please. I found it actually did Castling Moves fine (you can't if in check people!). Some AI animation would be nice e.g. looking at their moves; thinking hard/frowning; smug; worried; sad & happy etc. Rid the height adjustment and just add a RESET POSITION!

But the AI opponent is really the worst chess AI I have ever played against. Even on the highest level the AI makes stupid mistakes.

The Queen will sacrifice itself pointlessly, a Rook will eat a Pawn and then get killed, there is no plan, no understanding, no strategy or tactic, no knowledge,  no nothing in this chess ""engine"".
