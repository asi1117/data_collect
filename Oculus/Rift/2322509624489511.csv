2022-05-28 19:10:59.149938,Darkstar_IE,Dont waste your time and money,"Ive already wasted enough time with this, so ill keep this short. its basically broken. has potential, but after 1 jump, that was terrible, i just decided no more. - dont waste your time and money. if It was free, its not worth installing, sorry to be harsh, but its true.","Feb 23, 2020 at 2:44 PM",1, 18,
2022-05-28 19:10:59.163900,KloudKickr,Skip it,"Skydive instructor here. I’m not sure what the designers were going for, but it feels like no one who was involved in the creation has gone skydiving. No motion controls, and the parachute flight is horrible. If the developers are reading, the parachute is backwards, the break lines go to the rear of the canopy.","Dec 23, 2019 at 3:29 AM",1, 53,
2022-05-28 19:10:59.178860,Dabubaby,Its broke,"Bought it, Cant get past the start menu. Have deleted and re-installed twice.","Feb 22, 2020 at 9:04 AM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 19:10:59.192823,sjschlueter,,"For $5 I'd expect the developers to at least acknowledge the recommendations for developing for VR.  There's immediately continuous movement in the tutorial, which makes you dizzy.  The skydiving part is the same-- tumbling disconnected from your physical movement.
In addition to those basic points, the intro an tutorial are excruciatingly boring, and not well explained.  The button prompts aren't even specific to VR-- it refers to ""double tapping"" or pressing ""A.""  The graphics and simulation are quite disappointing as well.
This is a very poor VR experience.","Feb 4, 2019 at 3:03 AM",1, 15,
2022-05-28 19:11:02.296522,Mungrel,Just no,"You begin by walking - with no real control over it besides facing vaguely the direction you want to go. Then when you inevitably hit a wall or object, instead of stopping, you're continuously piledrived into said object lol. Couldn't figure out how to pickup the 4 objects - though upon reading other reviews, perhaps thats a mouse job. Dunno.
In any case, glad it didn't cost me much but I'm spewing I waited to so long before trying it and can't refund it now. Hopefully it gets improved with a patch or something.","Feb 25, 2019 at 5:51 PM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 19:11:02.311482,grekb,It was ...mmmkay?,"Warning!  Its a very amateur app (propably from a college student). It was ok but its missing so much stuff.
-No touch support
-No movement options (Warning: there is no snap turn, so a lot of people will get nausea)
-Amateur graphics (for example when the plane door opens there is nothing to show you that there is strong wind all over the place, the ship is not moving, its just a photo of it with static waves behind it, but the most annoying is your parachute: it doesnt move at all! Obviously there is no air to move it)
-You dont control anything. You just fall and wait 20 seconds to touch down, there is nothing to do...
It was a good idea but a bad execution","Dec 21, 2018 at 4:18 AM",3, 21,
2022-05-28 19:11:02.326442,Dropla,Even for 5.00,"This kind of should have been free. 

 You enter into the game and need to collect your gear. I don't know why I have to do this...The movement is VERY slow and the items are across the room.  
 Then, I sllllowly walk outside and on to a plane.
 Then, I sit in a grey windowless plane and close the door and walk verrrry slowly to a seat so I can wait more. and more. and then some more. Really, this shouldn't have been part of the experience unless there were at least windows to look out of.
 Then....it's time to jump. 
Then I start spinning and spinning. It's the first time Ive had motion sickness in VR since the DK2. 
Then, I closed the game and took off my headset and wrote this.

So...it was clearly a school project, which with some polish, could be good, but, it really needs to trim out the boring parts and give better controls on the fall. The graphics after all that. The other things, I find at this point are more important. Good luck!","Dec 25, 2018 at 12:27 PM",2, 12,
2022-05-28 19:11:02.341402,uncle_todd,confusing,"the controls are rather vague so its more of a crash and die to learn scenario.

over all its amusing.","Mar 18, 2019 at 5:55 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:11:02.355364,Myparentsmstake,why charge for this?,first. it takes 5 minutes just to get to the plane. then you gotta wait forever to get into the air. then you have to look at the sub-par gaphics through some stupid digital wind goggles.  amature at best.,"Dec 27, 2018 at 11:46 PM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 19:11:05.446098,anninagiani,Great experience,"If you ever wished to skydive, this is actually the closest thing for me so far and at a 4.99 price!
The tutorial is ok, but when it gets to the Skilled and Night launch, thats when it gets exciting! Try both out if you really want to enjoy this game 100%","Dec 21, 2018 at 3:00 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:11:05.461058,manulalla,Finally!,A real skydiving simulator on Rift finally! Don't do this standing! lol,"Dec 21, 2018 at 2:30 AM",5, 5,
