2022-05-28 20:07:04.435294,lMr.Deathl,"Glitchy, cant even finish fight.","I have tried to play the Bareknuckle fight atleast 20 times. Before i can finish the fight, my oppenent literally backs all the way past the containers and basically runs away.

Sometimes he comes back but that takes forever and is rare. The centering in VR is off aswell, but that could be an issue on my end. 

Anyway one star for it loading up, 2 stars for the music in the gym. Fix the bareknuckle mode. Idk about anything else, its all i tried in the game.","Oct 27, 2020 at 11:02 AM",2, 15,
2022-05-28 20:07:04.449761,Alicia_Wonderland,Awful!,"Glad I got this on sale for $2.99. Unfortunately I waited too long to try it or I definitely would have returned it. The gloves feel like balloons when you hit something with almost no haptic feedback and are very glitchy. I feel like a little kid with a balloon in each hand. Also in practice even if you hit the target exactly, it often doesn’t register and the height is way off. Even when I make myself a few inches taller than I am, it sets the target sometimes at the opponent’s groin level which I’m pretty sure is not allowed. How is this POS on the market? I guess it gives you a little exercise but you might as well be punching at air, which you basically are with such minimal haptic feedback.","Nov 21, 2020 at 7:23 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 20:07:04.464721,KingOfShaurma,imho its bad copy of Thrill of the fight,"A lagging interface that is not only huge, but also doesn't work the first time. Working out fights with half-dead half-dead opponents, strange sounds and their positions at the ""Street"" location. And it seems to me that if not a very similar analog, then just a bad copy of The Thrill of the Fight in general.","Aug 16, 2020 at 1:12 AM",1, 36,
2022-05-28 20:07:04.479681,Philx123,Much better than expected,"The problem with any boxing game/sim is that it will automatically be compared to The Thrill of the Fight. As such, going into this game, I had low expectations, but actually, I was pleasantly surprised. Visually, it was similar to TTOTF, though the adversary was a little more cartoony, and everything functioned well. The oponent seemed to use different default combos to TTOTF, which I've played so much now as to be able almost to predict. I had no issues with lag, and the fighting seemed plausible. There seem limited customisation options, and on first inspection seems limited in that respect. I liked the pad option, though the combos, if you're following the cues, are wrong, in that, padwork requires you to always hit across the pads - that is, jab hits right pad (facing you), cross hits left etc - the game wants you to follow a number pattern which has you jabbing and crossing to both left and right. If you've done any pad work, it's a difficult habbit to break. All in all, enjoyable for me, but hope there's more work put in to bring it up to the level of TTOTF. It could be a worthy rival.","Aug 22, 2020 at 2:10 AM",4, 12,
