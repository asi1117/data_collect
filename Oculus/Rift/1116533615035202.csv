2022-05-28 15:34:35.203724,chessdude,"Great principle, poor execution","While I enjoy this style of game, I found there were several issues with this game that made it rather unfun. Firstly, my VR setup does not have a good view of the ground, and there are several levels where you have to place things very close to the ground, so completing those levels was frustrating. Mini mode helped, but the precision in that mode is low.
Second, much of this game is about making extremely precise placements. Unlike similar games, there is no means to make fine adjustments, so you have to have very steady hands and wait to get lucky. This is made worse by the non-infinite test balls, so you don't have a constant stream to use and fine tune your accuracy.
Third, instead of keeping you ""in bounds"" with a barrier, there are several places where you can just move out of bounds and it teleports you after a short delay. This is especially frustrating in the Professional campaign room, where not only is there no clear boundary, but you have to reach out into the ambiguous zone for several levels.
Fourth, the fixed level design elements often don't work as required. I have had to add unnecessary elements because the preexisting structure doesn't work as intended.
Fifth, there are some levels that are fundtionally impossible. Not just that I can't do it, almost no one else can, as the ""top 10"" list only has three entries. This is intermixed with easy, solve in 10 seconds and try to get a high score levels. I personally find the last level to be among these, even though it has a full high score list- you don't have enough balls to complete the level, so whatever the solution is, it requires breaking the established rules of the game.
Sixth, the scores are negative. The developers couldn't have added a 10000 point completion score to avoid the ugly negative score results? It is also very unclear how fast you have to be for a time bonus, but it appears to be constant for every level rather than based on the level complexity, typical time to completion, etc.",Dec 10 at 9:10 AM,3, 0,
2022-05-28 15:34:35.220678,Darcangel777,Good game but needs some loving,"Enjoyed the game and it has great potential.  I found the menu selection clumsey having to wait for a finger to point then pressing trigger to select an item. Graphics  could do with refresh imo ie Color the balls rather than having different shapes. I experienced a number of bugs. Several of the levels had the exact same 'Create Items"" choices and quantities for easy and medium and a few times also for hard as well :(. This made the solution for all three levels exactly the same. Pressing the download option in the menus froze my game forcing a restart.","Aug 17, 2020 at 4:45 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 15:34:35.243617,littlelamp100,Great puzzle game,"Really fun game. puzzles were easy at first but they got more challenging towards the end. The multiple difficulties and workshop support give this game a lot of replay value which is nice. I still can't figure out how to beat the last ""professional"" level, and there aren't any guides... I've come to the conclusion that I'm too dumb :p","Nov 27, 2019 at 4:26 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 15:34:35.261569,thoiter,Yes.,"Recent changes have improved this game quite a lot from it's original state. The gameplay was always good, but lack of customization in controls was holding it back in my opinion.  Now that's been rectified it's time for another playthrough.","Jul 2, 2019 at 4:13 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 15:34:35.278524,Duncan_Disorderly,It's good again!,"I decided to revisit this game after reading the recent comments from the devs claiming they had resolved the issues in the game. At first, I was sceptical because I spawned well below the station. However, after I raised myself higher, the station appeared and I could play! 

If I had rated this game last year, I would have given it one star, for one reason alone. This game started off great, but went glitchy. As a result, I found myself below the ground I was supposed to be walking on and any attempt to fix the issue didn't work. Also, using the menu was difficult. So, for a while, the game was unplayable. It was such a shame because it's a brilliant game that begs you to revisit as it never plays the same twice. This means you can change your tactics or play on a harder level or beat your stats from a previous play. Few games give you this opportunity, which is why I value them highly.  

Gameplay generally involves figuring out how to get balls from point A to point B. You have a menu of items to choose from in order to acclomplish the task. The items have different functions and they're made available in line with the level. These items range from flat rectangular pieces that urge the balls to move in one direction or one that catches the balls and flings them across the room, just to name a couple. It's an imaginative game that forces you to use your imagination to achieve your goal. It's definately unique and fun to play. 

The one downside is it appears the experimental mode to change your perspective needs further work. Basically, you can play either normal sized or you can shrink the surroundings so it appears like a tiny model. The problem is, when you shrink down it's near impossible to access your hand menu. When I tried to revert to the original size, I had a hell of a time trying to reach the button in the menu. Hopefully they'll resolve this issue as it's awesome to play it small. Perhaps there is way to sort it out easier, but I couldn't find a way.","Jan 12, 2019 at 8:23 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:34:38.405161,DrOculusVR,great puzzle game,"move ment options would be quite good but im ok with teleport love the puzzles in this game and how you can make  it more complex with bonus objectives too

felt like a new way to deal with level based puzzle games enjoyed","Oct 10, 2018 at 2:52 AM",4, 3,"The newest update includes a lot of different locomotion options, including joystick, 'onward'-style, world grab as well as teleport with a variety of speeds, snap turn angles, smooth turn options as well as optional vignetting."
2022-05-28 15:34:38.421118,drash,Incredible Machine on the moon!,"This app is well done, with lots of inventive puzzles that start out with simple stuff and then steadily ramps way up into the stuff that really gets your creative juices flowing.   No way you can finish this one in a one sitting (or two or three or four)!  

Menu system is pleasant to use, but you have to get used to using the trigger to actually press a button.  (I assume this was done to avoid accidentally pressing the wrong button.)    

Note: I saw an earlier review that mentions it doesn't load - it definitely loads for me on a machine that is barely the recommended Rift spec, but note that it takes a good 20-30 seconds (I don't have it installed on SSD), and the loading indicator is near the center of your playspace so I can imagine some players not seeing it and wondering what's happening.","Jun 15, 2018 at 8:01 AM",5, 2,

Extensive tutorial. Nicely balanced graphics, but still simple enough to be completely fluid. In-game radio (music player). - Cons: Requires quite precise hand tracking sometimes.","Mar 4, 2018 at 9:17 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 15:34:38.467993,Nucleartwig,Game won't start (fixed itself?),"UPDATE 2: Your email domain is not found Dev.
UPDATE: I don't know what's changed. Since the time of the review to now (Sep 8) my computer has been off the entire time as I have been busy. Decided to try one last time before attempting refund. No new updates to game or windows. Either way, I was able to play the first 4 levels with all difficulties completed and started the 5th with no issues. Reason for four stars is because optimization could be better and the menu is glitchy. At the moment, completing a level and trying to replay the level on the harder difficulties is a chore because selecting the difficulty drops the menu down but it ends up overlapping with the existing menu if that makes any sense. Basically the selections overlap and you end up hitting next level instead of selecting hard difficulty or replaying level on easy instead of medium. Replaying a level at this point requires quitting the level and restarting it with the desired difficulty. What I've played so far I've enjoyed. Once the issues get fixed I will bump it to 5 and as long as the game keeps starting up without issue.

(Sep 3) Once the game gets patched to working again then will update. Played the first level. Closed the game. Returned to it the next day and the game will not start. You get the black screen with the hour glass in the oculus headset, but on the computer screen it's like a frozen split screen. However, you can still hear the sound in game as if it loaded fine. Have to use task manager to shut the game down. Also, in the time I was able to play, the game does not seem to be optimized all that well. I'm running an i5 6600k with a gtx 1070 and 16 GB of ddr4 ram on an SSD and pretty much any setting increase will cause the framerate to drop to 45. That is assuming the in game counter is correct. All my other games run fine and can max out the settings (except a few). Until this is fixed it's unplayable and a waste of money. A reinstall unfortunately did not fix the problem.","Sep 9, 2017 at 10:17 AM",4, 3,"[Update 11 September]

It just keeps crashing. Better wait some patchs before buy. Edit : I finaly get the game working.

2022-05-28 15:34:41.619564,ChrisVR84,Great Game... minor bugs...,This is my first review of a game.  Mostly because of how much potential this game has.  I absolutely love it!  The only problems I had was levels not saving/unlocking after I complete them so I had to go back and replay a lot of them just to proceed.  Even after going into the menu and saving my progess that didn't work.  I also can't load any community puzzles.  Other than minor glitches I kept running into the game is amazing!,"May 22, 2017 at 10:18 AM",4, 6,"Hi, I just pushed an update that fixes the level progression bug.

2022-05-28 15:34:44.694340,zbufferVR,Very nice puzzles,"The progression guides you through the different tools. There are a lot of possibilities, levels in ""easy"" mode are easy enough, then replay in more difficult modes means more challenges.","Jul 17, 2017 at 8:46 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:34:44.709299,Sedilis,Best physics puzzler I've played,"Reminiscent of Portal but not just another Portal clone.  Original gameplay, fun and challenging levels and a great UI makes this game is an instant favorite.
 
The game introduces the tools you will use at a steady rate during the first easy levels.  And there are good variety of those tools allowing you to be quite creative in the solutions to each puzzle.  With the replayability of levels at harder difficulties forcing you to use either different or mechanics or a restricted tool set.  Add in the community puzzles and this game has a lot of potential.","May 26, 2017 at 10:52 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:34:44.725257,SkScotchegg,Absolutely amazing puzzle game!!,"This game is well made, I bought it last night and have just played it for 2 hours and had to drag myself away to go to the gym! haha This game is wicked! Reminds me of playing portal for first time, even though its very differant. Solving puzzles has never been so much fun! Looks great, good graphics! No bugs detected and I reckon you could spend so many hours doing these puzzles with friends and family. I can't recommend this puzzle game enough! I like how it has an in-game radio which lets you play music or select your own music too. I didn't realise that until I finished playing but with music it's even better. It's so worth the money! Trust me its fantastic!! You can solve puzzles in all differant kinds of ways, let your imagination run wild!","May 21, 2017 at 12:21 AM",5, 6,

Such a cool idea.  Works brilliantly!  Now need to move my music over to the local folder!

Question: do I play with 3D mode so the music sounds like it is coming from the spawned radio player for that lab/workshop authenticity or play 2D and pretend I am using headphones...

2022-05-28 15:34:47.870844,Shaav,remembers me of portal,"Like in the game ""Portal"" you have to solve physical puzzles. It makes fun but in contrast to portal it doesn't have atmosphere. The developers could have added at least some nice music. Furthermore I had to teleport a lot because my room is so small. This lead to some tracking issues. It would be cool if you could make yourself bigger or all aperatures smaller so that you would not need to teleport that much.","May 2, 2017 at 3:39 AM",3, 3,"Hi,
the game has a built in mp3 player, which lets you play local mp3 files places in the /mp3 folder. It also has 5 built-in radio stations that are user configurable to anything that provides a mp3 stream.
There is also a miniature mode in the settings, which does exactly what you described. The whole game can even be played seated, no movement required."

Fantastic contraption has that same effect.

Demoed it recently at a Hackathon, everybody enjoyed it very much and didn't want to leave the game...!

There is a little bit of a learning curve (3mn) as the interface and game flow is original and need to get used too.

I highly recommend it, it's a solid VR experience and I know it will have even more features and levels in the upcoming updates.
