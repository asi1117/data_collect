2022-05-28 19:41:12.977961,Leonidas-I,Know What You Are Buying,"For context, I'm a Mars fanboy.  Terraforming, colonization, Spacex, the whole shebang.  I bought this since it was on sale for a dollar and why not?  I enjoyed this experience for what it was worth, but you should know what you're buying.  
NOTE: Spoilers I guess?  Not much to spoil, but whatever.  
So basically the experience is a short 2D cinematic of the Curiosity rover landing, followed by a series of tasks typically performed by rovers (collecting samples, traveling, taking pictures, etc.), finally culminating in an disappointing tease with no apparent follow-through planned.  
Pros: 
-Good narration, cites Mars facts in an intelligent manner.  
-Decent graphics, was disappointed at first but the game is slighly older, so expected.  
-Feels a lot like Mars.  
Cons:
-Short
-Frustrating tease that leads nowhere
-More of a demo than full game? Only 20 mins long

In short, buy this (on sale) if you are an avid space geek and only want a few good views and factoids.  If you want gameplay, story, length, replayability, look elsewhere.","May 27, 2020 at 7:20 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 19:41:13.062875,FastLawyer,I love space & mars ...,"but I almost fell asleep playing this ""game."" Subpar graphics, very dry gameplay elements, VR does not make Mars look good in this app.","Oct 20, 2018 at 7:57 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 19:41:13.079688,nrosko,Very short & boring.,"Not sure how this is getting 5 stars i mean really? Played this on rift PD at 1.6 graphics I would say below avarage even in epic. Game consists of you move to a few different places & ride a storm, you pick up some rocks then go to another place & dril a few holes  & take a photo. The end.  A 10 min experience if that & not worth the money.","Aug 27, 2018 at 10:14 PM",1, 13,
2022-05-28 19:41:13.107613,matrox89,not bad at all,It takes a while to get use to the controls but the environment is well done. It would be great to have more freedome to explore and a longer story.,"Aug 25, 2018 at 3:18 PM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 19:41:13.123571,matt.frrck,Good one and here is why,"It's a good experience. Better than any other 'space experiences'  I've played. 
Pros:
1- Graphics and visuals are stunning. No other word. Starting location looks like the pictures from Mars.
2- Good narration. Story is decent. Some of the moments feel really realistic if you are a Mars nerd!
Cons:
1- Some of the controls take time to get used to during the mission. Sometimes it can be challenging at first. It can be more intuitive.
2 - Couple missions are whatever. If you want gameplay, don't expect much during these missions.

After the experience, there is a feeling that they might come up with the second game. I'd like to see that.","Aug 26, 2018 at 9:18 AM",4, 15,
2022-05-28 19:41:16.220416,cooperroni,Really good,"I think this experience is what VR is about. You feel like you are actually there.
I did not finish the whole experience and I'm not interested in finishing the missions either cause I love going around and seeing the landscape. Some of the rocks and landscape elements are almost 1 to 1 compared to images taken from curiosity rover. 

If you like space adventures, this is one of the best space vr experience out there.","Aug 28, 2018 at 4:45 AM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 19:41:16.235376,dabneyleew,Short but good!,"It's short but good. Everything works fine. I'm not sure what people expect from these experiences that they bought for less than 10 bucks! This is basically Curiosity Rover(even though in-game rover is slightly different) and I can see someone liking it if you are into mars and space! IF you are not a space enthusiast, then don't buy this! If you like Mars then def buy it!","Aug 29, 2018 at 2:47 AM",4, 11,
2022-05-28 19:41:16.251333,blkshaw,One good experience,"I was pretty impressed with what I saw. Great visuals, awesome narrative. It's little short(I finished in 20min). I'm not sure why others thought controls were not intuitive but I like everything I saw. You'd like this one if you like space related experiences.","Aug 26, 2018 at 12:22 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 19:41:16.267291,ddixon80,Best Mars VR Experience,"It's probably the best Mars VR experience out there. Even thought it's not mentioned, I believe it's based on Curiosity Mission. Look and feel is great! In some places I found controls to be hard to use but that's the only thing. A must have VR experience!!!","Aug 26, 2018 at 9:31 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 19:41:16.282251,demirkefeli,Better Mars Experience,It's one of the best Mars experiences out there. Amazing visuals and a good story. Actual gameplay can use some improvement if you are into gameplay but the experience itself is worth it!,"Aug 25, 2018 at 3:16 PM",5, 13,
