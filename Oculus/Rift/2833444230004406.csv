2022-05-28 18:14:20.139049,JEANPAUL1605,"just, amaizing.","in my experience this is one of the best games that you can experience in vr, is a combination of suspense, horror and the puzzles, which keeps you interested, and it is very interactive aswell. great, just great!!","Jun 10, 2021 at 1:41 PM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 18:14:20.182932,presRoslin,Great horror escape room!,"The puzzles were fun and it was pretty spooky.  Liked the theme, the atmosphere and the sounds.  Great experience/short game.  And got it on sale for a little over $3 so can't complain =)","Aug 8, 2020 at 12:22 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:14:23.294610,blove9387,eh..it was ok,not the worst vr game...good for one play through but not very scary...way to many 5 star reviews...def not that good but not awful...worth the 5 bucks or so,"May 14, 2020 at 10:58 AM",2, 11,
2022-05-28 18:14:23.309569,JeremyC85,Short but sweet,"Its a standing 'roomscale' escape room game with a horror twist. Not super scary and fairly short (took me a few tries here and there finishing at an hour). At the price point of 10$ its a little steep, but it often goes on sale. Would recommend due to the high level of polish the game brings even at 10$, on sale it could be a steal!","Feb 21, 2020 at 2:47 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 18:14:23.323532,uk.chris.mills,Outstanding game and outstanding support,"Brilliant game the best escape games I’ve played on VR to date, great graphics and story line. Needed some install help - they responded on Xmas day and resolved the issue I had which turned out to be with the oculus store not the game. This developer is well worth supporting and look forward to future releases and games. Well done guys.","Dec 26, 2019 at 11:42 PM",5, 22,
2022-05-28 18:14:23.338492,Karaste3,One of most polished VR games,This game is so realistic. I once played Kobold via oculus link. When I purchased Pagan on Steam I had problems to launch. Once I communicated with the another world vr Devs I experienced the most helpful guys I ever saw in my 30 years of gaming. They tried to solve the problem  by daily and immediate emails. and on the other hand they informed me that the game is out on Oculus store and give me a voucher code for the inconvenience and appreciation. The game is amazing with great puzzles atmosphere and super realistic graphics. Well done guys and I hope that youll continue and grow as you deserve. A must have game experience,"Dec 22, 2019 at 12:27 AM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 18:14:23.353452,pacoham,Short but great,"My only complaint is that it's short, less than an hour. But considering the price, it more than makes up for it with fantastic graphics and atmosphere and some decent puzzles. The object interactions are well done too, that isn't always a given in VR games. I would love to see a longer game from these developers, I'm excited to think what they could do.","Jan 3, 2020 at 10:47 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 18:14:26.479092,jonbean4523,,"Really good escape room, with pretty good puzzles.But the thing that gets me is the atmosphere is amazing. Plus the price is well worth it.took me like 2 hrs of messing with all the puzzles to complete it.","Dec 27, 2019 at 6:10 PM",4, 9,
2022-05-28 18:14:26.494052,Masamune5454,very well done,"i do wish it was longer, and that there was more item interaction. also partial spoiler, but the last part i lose my light source and its crazy dark. i feel this could have been acheive by having my light source go out at time when there were creepy sounds, and i didnt see anything until the end, so the darkness just made it hard to progress... i may have had my eyes closed sometimes though. theres alot here thats done good though. i wish the easy mode wasnt so accesible, becuase i thought it gave me more time, not make the initial puzzles easier and less good.
also there is the part with a syringe looking thing with 4 aplhabet rotation locks and i cant for the life of me figure out what its for. i wont say the password i used but its above it. 
also i wish there was a candle with the lighter, so you could set the candle down and keep the lighter on you. it fell through the floor at one point, and i had to watch the unskippable intro agian(MAKE IT SKIPPABLE PLEASE lol)
other than that its well done, and the atmosphere plays a big part, its not totally jump scare reliant, but still makes you feel very uneasy. especially when you see other people that have passed or been in the same situation as you.
interesting for sure and probably my favorite escape game so far. i just wish at a point these would become real games, kinda like how face your fears 2 was a legit game.","Jan 7, 2020 at 1:28 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:14:26.509012,ToxicMafia,Hate it,"So boring and not at all scary, total waste of money. I don't get the positive reviews? Plus its kind of a scam cause some of the scary parts you see in the trailer don't exist in the game.","Jan 1, 2020 at 6:18 AM",1, 3,
2022-05-28 18:14:26.524969,RomperStomp,Movie like quality,"I liked it. It took me just under two hours to escape and I was thoroughly entertained (and freaked out) throughout. This is a very immersive and cinematic experience. As someone else pointed out it is best played on high graphics settings. The devs have set it to low by default, but high setting can be selected in the menu and make it sharper and even more realistic in the Rift S.","Dec 21, 2019 at 11:03 PM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 18:14:29.621686,TommyGunVR,Chilling escape room game. Top notch!,"Recently got addicted to escape room games. This one is one of the best and took me about an 1:45 to get out of the house. After that it changes flavour to more of a lost in the woods kind of experience which really freaked me out. Beautiful game, challenging and fun and very seasonal ;-)","Dec 23, 2019 at 6:47 PM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 18:14:29.636646,GarciaField,AAA visuals + good story and atmosphere,"Pagan peak is a detective situation with escape room elements. Everything is tightly wrapped together, the atmosphere is phenomenal.","Feb 20, 2020 at 1:39 PM",5, 2,
