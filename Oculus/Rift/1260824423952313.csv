2022-05-28 17:13:48.931711,price_kelley,Amazing!,"You get one track and its pretty much the perfect track for a single experience, well put together and runs like a dream, its such a shame the user cant input their own music and have all the hard work that the dev put in as a visualizer! I do recommend this however.",Aug 3 at 1:19 AM,5, 6,
2022-05-28 17:13:48.946671,brewedtaco,Other designers and musicians take note,"If you design for VR or work on soundtracks for VR games or experiences, take note of this app. This hits all the marks for a great experience in virtual reality. The visuals are well optimized, so there seems to be nothing lacking in the graphics. They work very well with the excellent soundtrack. This experience is over rather quickly, but I know for sure that I'll return to it often because the music is unlikely to get old. I hope to see more from this designer and hear more from this producer.","Jun 3, 2021 at 12:38 AM",5, 3,

It's very relaxing. Just sit back and enjoy the music and the light show. It isn't the kind of music that I listen to, but I ended up playing it again and again. It's very unique and a great VR experience","Oct 3, 2020 at 2:04 PM",5, 7,

Since I use the Rift S with it's kind of speakers, I really get angry about FB when I want to enjoy this app.  And whit my 2.1 speakers to much immersion get lost. The speakers of the CV1 have been pretty good. So why??? Market analyses?Much immersion comes even from the sound. 

But sorry, I forgot myself... 
I would give 6 stars this smooth floating trip! Please more ;)","Jun 10, 2020 at 6:01 PM",5, 5,

Like ''Above & Beyond', ''ZHU', 'Eli & Fur', 'Zedd', 'Calvin Harris' etc... Would like a tool to create light shows that go to the music.

just stand there, listen to the music, and look around.

This art shows how VR could be different than other mediums and the height it could take one into a totally surealistic dream land. Remarkable work and certainly a representational effort in VR.

p.s. hope the developer would continue extending this piece of art","Sep 13, 2019 at 7:40 PM",5, 2,

The musis is great, starting slowly and growing - and the environment changes into a perfect matching light show - starting nearly black and minimalistic and growing with the music. More such stuff! I would even pay, seen it multiple times already.
Only problem: The Rift S ""black"" level (more like medium gray) destroys some of the looks in the darker scenes. But the app can nothing for this.","Aug 26, 2019 at 5:23 AM",5, 4,

You need to like that kind of electronic music, but even if not, the visuals are beautiful to look at and let you flow through a fictive space of something. Imporvement idea: I would wish the sequences were longer, or that once could choose the place to look at. Maybe add more of this kind, because it's just wonderful.","Jul 8, 2019 at 8:15 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 17:13:58.412354,Gabriel_Prime,Beautiful visualization.,"Without attempting to sound pretentious, this is a VR attempt at the visual presentation of the symbiosis of music—and it’s quite good. I would love to hear more music combined with more visual explorations. Classical adaptations would be fantastic in this format, much in the fashion that Forest of Piano makes accessible the intricacies of the piano for idiots like me who don’t know anything about music or art.","Jul 11, 2019 at 2:05 PM",5, 0,

Slow few stars moving start that just keeps building and starts you moving through a pretty spectacular light show. Way too short to pay for, but you know, you don't, it's free! If they added more cool content and charged a small fee, like $1.99 U.S., I would pay for it. Not worth a big title cost but with a good hour or more of this amazing visual zen ride, I'd push a little money their way. Keep going developer(s)!!!","Jun 5, 2019 at 12:56 PM",5, 6,
