The jazzy soundtrack is bad. Sounds like what you'd listen to in an elevator in hell or in a Siberian dance hall in the late 70s. The only real positive I can say about this game is that it is a good workout and it ran fairly well (90 fps) on my 1060 GTX. It's running on the Unity Engine and the visuals are passable I suppose. If you're thinking about getting this for your little kid, don't. The subject matter is adult-themed.","Jul 18, 2020 at 12:43 PM",2, 0,
