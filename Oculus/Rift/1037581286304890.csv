2022-05-28 15:05:38.267407,hambugerrman,Game works now,"I dont know if the devs updated the game, or I just fixed whatever issue my computer was having with compatability.  But the game runs perfectly fine now.  Still irritated I couldnt play this game for 6 months, but I do appreciate the game working now.  Its a pretty standard arcade style turret defense shooter.  For 5 bucks its above average, good graphics, punchy shooting, fun gameplay.  I feel like the turret style arcade shooter genre is so perfect for vr, yet we have almost no games for it.  Would love to see a sequel that expands on this concept.  Maybe defending a moving ship during battles, Ground combat, different turret types, slightly less twichy controls so it feels like you are actually manning a heavy turret instead of just looking in the general direction of firing.   Its a great game to pick up and show friends, for 5 bucks absolutely worth it.",Dec 23 at 7:52 PM,4, 3,
2022-05-28 15:05:38.282366,masterkraze,BROKEN WASTE OF TIME!,Such a shame the dev rather kill this great game rather then fix and update it.... so not only not buy this but anything from this publisher sad since it was such a fun game too,Nov 30 at 10:12 AM,1, 2,
2022-05-28 15:05:38.298323,ladybig,Dont buy! Buy it again!,"This game is broken and you cannot report the launch bug anymore on web site. Sadly, It was one of my favorite experience for first time vr player at home.

17/01/2022 Review update. Good news, the game works again. I just reinstalled it and play 30 mins without crash (all save been lost). The game takes around 30 sec to launch , so be patient. Tip : LAUNCH IT with the xbox controller type. Otherwise the right trigger on your oculus touch will reconized to start the game but the X button wont works to reload ammos. Once in the game you cant switch from the touch to xbox controller.  For the price, is still a good experience for all vr beginner.",Jan 19 at 8:49 AM,4, 16,
2022-05-28 15:05:38.312286,Hi-Flyer,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I echo the person below! This game is abandoned, does not work anymore, and Oculus/facebook is wrong to still be selling it!!!","Jun 5, 2021 at 4:59 AM",1, 8,

2022-05-28 15:05:41.471836,neilykins69,At last....Actual fun in a Space Shooter,"I just utterly love this game. Elite is too complicated, too pixelly and too awkward to play in VR. EVE Valkyrie is too aimless and repetitive. I just wanted to blast some ships in space and see them explode in glorious, large scale 3D and THAT'S WHAT THIS IS TO PERFECTION!!! WHOEVER COMISSIONED THIS GAME, THANK YOU. I don't leave many reviews, but this game has lit my fuse for VR all over again. You sit in the gunnery pod of a spaceship and blast waves of incoming baddies, just like the old Incoming PC game. It sounds a bit shallow I know. But in a full-scale 3D transparent cockpit with red kamikaze nutcase spaceships attacking you and explosions and smoke trails everywhere, THIS IS VR! It's the sheer joy of being inside a game, and this game just 'gets it'. Simple controls, just look where you want to aim your gun, right trigger for primary weapon, left trigger to activate powerup and X button to reload. VRgasmic. VERY, VERY WELL DONE.","Dec 15, 2019 at 4:48 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 15:05:41.490786,JCat,One of the original Rift Space Shooters,"It's basically Galaga in 3D space. You gun turrets follow your gaze, so it's a look at the enemies and blast away affair. The control feels incredibely good with this technique. The on-board mission control voice is sarcastically fun! It can be a bit repetitive, but the high speed, fluid control just makes it flow nicely. Playing on the S, I miss the deep blacks of the original Rift, but gain the fine detail.","Nov 7, 2019 at 5:29 PM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 15:05:41.506742,kobs57,A fun game,"Bought this game after reading a few reviews on here and it's really fun, a little repetitive but the graphics are great and if you like blasting stuff out of the sky this will make you smile. Not hard to get used to and always fun to come back and do some more damage lol. I played galaga back then and  aside from the basics and acrobatics the ships make, it has nothing to do with the old game, much more fun to blast the ships in 3D. A really inexpensive fun game, i'd recomend this one even to peoples who are a little motion sensitive, it doesn't move much, the guns and your whole environement move with your head, you look at the ships where ever they come and press the buttons so no real motion like say in air car. I'd say more ""comfortable"" than moderate but some peoples are real sensitive to motion so a little moderate. Great game to start to get used to motion. Love it 5 stars","Nov 27, 2019 at 1:13 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:05:41.521702,TerryTiger,Simply Put -  Great Fun!,"A great looking wave shooter where you sit as a gunner defending your ""mothership"".  The ""look and shoot"" motion works very well.  Highly recommend a Gamepad (I'm using an XBox controller for PC).  It's a $5 game so don't expect more than what's been stated.  Sometimes you just want to simply point and shoot in a game and this is it.","Sep 27, 2019 at 3:58 AM",5, 2,

Seeing the same problem In another customer, It seems that they don't fix at all the bugs. Very, very bad.","Nov 17, 2018 at 8:51 AM",1, 12,

2022-05-28 15:05:44.707182,anlystMike,Touch controllers not supported,"They say Touch controllers are supported but there is no way to reload using the touch controllers. Really surprising that they would leave such a huge gap in compatibility. Gameplay is pretty straightforward, you move your head to look/target and press 'A' to fire. Some of the formations the drones fly are too predictable and get a bit boring after a while.","Oct 21, 2018 at 10:32 PM",2, 11,
2022-05-28 15:05:47.798913,Aetherion,Good Arcade Game,"When I first played this game, it was with a Gear headset, and without any other controller, I could only play by tapping my visor like Cyclops from X-Men. This is a really good arcade game, and comes with the same level of polish as you would except from CCP regarding the Eve universe. I can happily recommend this if you are a gamer who enjoys a good static shooting experience and the VR elements enhance the experience. 

There's a bit of replayability and accessibility to this one, everyone can play.

Good for sitting down whilst playing too.","Aug 31, 2018 at 9:58 PM",5, 0,

I have Oculus Rift and have had ZERO problems with it.  To reload on the rift pres X it's that simple.  I got this game when there was 2 reviews and this game is a strong 5.  Nothing fancy just plain old shoot and kill the bad guys.  
  I have not had any glitches in the game since I got it.  A must buy!!","Jun 27, 2019 at 7:50 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 15:05:50.982399,jontheepi,Fast-paced arcade-style shooter,"You will use your head (head mounted display) to aim/move, which took a little getting used to, and hand controllers to fire.  Many of the early levels are (too) easy, but the challenge does pickup.  Special weapons do extra damage and make you feel extra powerful.","Dec 30, 2017 at 11:17 PM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 15:05:54.205777,Barakaus,Basic Wave Shooter,"Even though it says the Touch is a supported controller, it isn't.  Only the right control is recognised, so this means you can't ""Press X to Reload!"".  Have to play with the XBox controller.

Works well for seated gameplay and because the turret is fixed there's no real motion sickness.  Starts out pretty fun, but gets repetetive very quickly.  Background doesn't have a feeling of depth and feels like it's a painted backdrop, so it's not as immersive as it could be.

Was an ok extra that came as part of a bundle, but I don't think I'd purchase it as a standalone.","Apr 12, 2017 at 8:52 PM",2, 3,

Once I found out the game does not support the Touch (though it fools you by accepting the trigger inputs), was able to get the controller to work...thank you for responding to my queries, developer team! The game does get a bit repetitive, but sometimes you just want to get in a quick 'blow everything up' kind of game and this certainly satisfies.","Apr 14, 2017 at 10:46 AM",4, 0,
