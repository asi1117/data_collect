2022-05-28 12:20:18.020164,Eatlead1986,1 star for rift being in the quest store,This is deceiving. I ripped my wallet out quicker than uncle Joey on Black Friday. Thinking that it was a stand alone version of the rift version. I was like FINALLY!!!!!!! oculus quest 2 decided to put big titles in their store! so I bought it on the mobile app and powered up my quest 2 to see that it wasn’t in the store front… so I went to the game on the mobile app to remote install it to the headset to find out that it’s a rift game that I’d have to install on my pc. What was the point of merging rift games to the quest 2 shop??? When you need a vr ready pc to play it??? Help me understand oculus on what your trying to achieve here? is this your answer to making better games for quest 2? what a joke…,Mar 5 at 11:18 PM,1, 98,

2022-05-28 12:20:18.064046,G4mb10r,Still Broken,"I got this game on sale for only about $6, and I thought, ""how bad can it be?"" At first, I could get past the thin plot because the graphics looked so nice... but quickly I noticed lots of stuttering (and my system can play Halflife Alyx smooth as butter). Then, before I could get very far, bugs prevented me from going forward. 

You need to eat in this game, not just to restore health, but also for general living and sustenance. The game glitched out so I could rarely eat, and when I did manage to get it to work (1 out of every 20 tries or so) it wouldn't restore the health bar, so essentially I can only go so far into the game until I starve and die. This is after the game has been out for a VERY long time, so I don't see this getting fixed anytime soon. If you want to see about 20 minutes of stuttery but pretty imagery and then quit, this is the game for you!","Mar 10, 2021 at 6:30 AM",1, 128,
2022-05-28 12:20:18.080003,SoulbreakerX,Great Game if you give it a chance!,"It took me a minute to get into the game but once I did it was really good, the atmosphere is amazing and the gunplay is fun.

2022-05-28 12:20:21.231687,SipheriousFLange,could be good but needs work,"This game has great graphics an engaging enough story, massive potential, but it falls on its face hard.  Your an elite trooper and you have the worlds crappiest pistol slow rate of fire and small mags. The pistol also likes to not work, shows up with a yellow glow around it and dosent fire. The harpys like to make the reloading sound and not work The game dosent trigger story points to progress the mission. I had to delete my game and restart. I have to save every 5 to 10 minutes to avoid loosing large chunks of progress due to previously mentioned bugs.  I really like  the game its just a buggy mess for me.","Dec 13, 2020 at 3:55 PM",2, 10,
2022-05-28 12:20:21.246647,TheWombo,Very impressed,"I love this game, and if you like Mass Effect, you'll love it as well. I believe this game is horribly underrated, so I decided to write a review. I played on CV1 rift for four years and recently switched to a Quest with a link cable. I cannot tell the difference in graphics or gameplay, except the color on the quest is better. With that said, a list of my PROs and CONs.

Pro - 
Graphics. 
Amount of guns and gunplay.
Depth of the game almost 30gigs.
Crafting exploring.
Voice acting.
Free movement. 
The leveling system isn't per level, but you can tell when you upgrade a gun or amour. 
Story.


Cons -
The load screens freeze, causing one to think the game froze. Give it some time it is loading; an SSD goes a long way.  
It is not a CON, but I do wish there was more even for a bigger game that's bigger than 90% I own and play. I still wish there was more. Devs, please make a sequel. 

I cannot say enough about this game, as I do genuinely enjoy it. IMO it is better than walking dead and as good as asgards wrath.  I will admit Mass Effect is my all-time favorite PC game, so it gives me a chance to feel like a space marine exploring alien planets.  Seeking Dawn is a few years old now but worth the buy. I play on a ryzen 5 with a GTX 1080 I  SS to 1.2, and it's beautifully smooth.","Oct 1, 2020 at 7:45 PM",4, 92,

2022-05-28 12:20:24.364889,CharlieLanky,Not bad,"Its like a semi decent but forgettable PS2 game in VR. Some of the scenery looks epic and is good to explore. Combat is and enemies are abit meh, physics is all very meh. Constantly needing to eat is also annoying. Spent the first 30 minutes of the game walking around with a burger in my left hand cos i couldnt unequip it, which was hilarious but i want the ability to use my burger as a mele weapon and smash some fools in the face with my quarter pounder. Good for sale price, would be hugely disapointing for anything over £10.","Oct 7, 2020 at 3:24 AM",3, 13,

It offers type of locomotion for all so you can be comfortable while exploring this beautiful lush and hostile environment. I love Co-op story games especially sci-fi and horror( this game being sci-fi) and have had multiple friends play it and we ha e a blast shooting our way through the many types of enemies who dare attack us.....and some of the poor bugs just sitting there lol,"Oct 20, 2020 at 4:45 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 12:20:24.424236,Hero,Very Fun!,"Now, I got this for $5 on sale and I do not encourage you to pay the full $30. There are far better games for $30 such as Boneworks, but this is the only $5 and it is one hell of a deal. The campaign is medium length don't expect no man's sky type of Gameplay length, but its average on par with Half Life: Alyx in terms of gameplay length. Now here is my rating of the important features of a VR game.

Gameplay: 8/10

Story: 6/10

Immersion: 8.5/10

Locomotion: 7/10

Voice acting: 3/10 (seriously it sucks trash)

Weapons: 7.5/10 

Cool factor: 8/10 

Fun: 9/10

LOD-switching is clearly visible.

There are some bugs. On multiple locations you can walk out of the map, and all you can do is restart the game and hope you saved it at a good point. Somehow the backpack got completely filled with ammo.","Oct 14, 2020 at 4:08 AM",3, 1,

2022-05-28 12:20:30.732594,AArevalo.01,"Not too bad of a game, could be better","For the current price at $8.99, its ok for anymore I would have asked for my money back. The game has a lot of bugs and game play issues. 

Farming is purposely made to slow your game play. 
Swapping weapons food and farming gear are all in the same area. 
Weapons should be on the sides and back. (Its is simple mechanic that all shooters follow, from the crappiest to the AAA games).
- But no not in this game, If you reach back, it shows you what your next task is.

Bugs: This thing still needs work. 
Some times you can farm items, some times you cant. 
Some times you get stuck walking a path and have to reset the game.
Some places you cant explore other you can and end up getting bugged. 

On top of that the game looks blurry. Cleaned the lenses every time before playing and also tested Asgards Wrath, and Stormland, those look clear. It's the game SeekingDawn, all settings at its highest and still looks blurry and stretched. Guess the stretched part is to make the bosses look bigger.

For the price I say buy it as if you where going to play a Demo or a beta. The game has potential just need more work.","Apr 28, 2020 at 5:09 AM",3, 57,

But I have learned now it was not the game and quest link patches have since resolved. So I'm actually glad now that my refund was denied. Because I have finally been able to get into it. Running an rtx 2060 and have this game on full throttle. Took me a while to find best comfort settings as my vr legs are still growing. But I would recommend the game.

It just have some saving issues, may be needs some rendering improvement. But it is great. Consistent storyline, great single player campaign, very immersive, good Sci fi, amazingly well made models, weapons and tools.

Also I didn't understand the eating and drinking mechanics. I grab something to have from my inventory but the percentabe bars don't move an inch? I even hear the eating sound.

Third thing is the two different inventory/quick menus. I mess up with them all the time. I would love to love this game more than I am currently capable of.","Jan 28, 2020 at 12:49 PM",3, 11,

1. Starting the game, the sound was too high it crackled and distorted. I had to find the sound settings and pull everything down to about 60% to lose that.
2. Load screens are super weird semi VR and semi not making them annoying and disorienting. 
3. Walking controls have an odd glitch... or they are just done differently than every other game..  If you move foward with the left thumb, then the right thumb changes direction, and that's normal, but once you stand still the right thumb stops turning and starts to strafe which is already on the left thumb. You can work around this by moving forward slightly but it is really annoying.

I tried restarting the computer and headset, tried the uninstall and reinstall the app, checked that everything is with the latest updates.... Still no go....

Is this a known problem??
Do you plan to release an update that solves this bug?

There r many quest users out there, some of them will use oculus link.

2022-05-28 12:20:43.410711,StormyDoesVR,A Third-Rate SteamVR Port,"I don't understand why this exists. It's that bad.

Cliche space shooter. Sexy female armor and terrible lip syncing.
wonky, unrealistic arm IK. Non fullbody character model. Large, overcomplicated UI systems. Touch controller mapping is off-putting and non-standardized. gunplay features no staples of VR, such as virtual stocks, resulting in feeling like I brought a pistol to a knife fight, except everyone is faster than me and I'm carrying 200 pounds of armor plating. No proper introduction to the universe, just two or three simple text boxes before being thrown into the tutorial, which is a simple walk down a hallway. Planets are cubes? Why? Player model doesn't look human, the hands are stretched to a very strange proportion, they don't meet the Touch Controller model standard at all, nor do they follow Touch's pose style interactions like in a game such as Robo Recall. No thumbs up.

Very poor experience, was expecting at least a half-decent survival shooter. Got a janky wave-based walking simulator with the bloom cranked up to 900. do not recommend. This was one of the least comfortable games I have ever played in VR, made me dizzy with all the flashing lights. This does not belong in the comfortable category whatsoever. It should come bundled with a Hospital simulator, because I feel like I need to lie down after playing this.","Dec 4, 2019 at 6:00 AM",1, 14,

2022-05-28 12:20:43.474540,DaMaverick1,Really great game once you get into it..,"Pros:
Graphics are amazing, and game style you can't really get bored. You do however have to make sure once you get your Base, you and construct your machines to make parts, you need to constantly mine and lumber trees in order to build better weapons. Your starting pistol will only do so much..

Cons:
They need to have it to where we can jump and teleport feature (without keep going into settings.), and more solid features. There were glitched walls, rails. and floors where I fell through and I had to keep constantly use teleport feature from the settings option to get out of them. If Teleport was automatically configured without going into options, that would help a lot. 

The disappearing and reappearing platforms are messed up.  When I jump on some of non disappearing ones I fall right through them. I thought they were some type of hologram, however when I jumped on the same ones I didn't fall through, however it kept repeating  on some of the others.","Nov 15, 2019 at 4:08 AM",4, 26,

Heavily recommend:
- Applying at least a 1.5x Super Sampling via Oculus Debug Tool PRIOR to launching game.  Can't adjust SS level during game, and game has HORRIBLE aliasing if SS not used.
- Force 45FPS ASW to cope with Super Sampling.
- Play game on *Easy* difficulty to prevent enemies from becoming bullet sponges.  Normally play all games on Hard difficulty, but enemies feel awful with very high health in this game.

I would definitely recommend checking out the crafting options whenever you can so you make sure that you are have everything you can -- make guns as soon as you can, make more ammo as well. Farm everything! When exploring the world collect as many rocks and trees as you can. Duel weild weapons when you can. Don't accidentally close the game without saving. This game is absolutely fun and requires some strategy when interacting with enemies; you can't just shoot wildly. My only critique is the load times. Defintely messes up the immersion, but it's worth it for the graphics. I'm excited to keep playing.","Dec 16, 2019 at 12:03 PM",5, 12,

The slow rate of fire makes my trigger finger go crazy trying to make it fire as fast as it can while 5 bad guys come at me (and bite me). Please increase the pistol fire rate and you would have someone more interested in playing and not thinking of getting a refund on a 9 dollar sale game. 

Graphics are good but combat is the most important thing, and unless I unlock a new gun in 60 minutes, I may ask for a refund as its very unplayable with such tough enemies and a crap pistol. I dont like runing backwards every fight cause my gun SUCKS.

************UPDATE, MAKE AN EQUIPMENT WORKSTATION RIGHT AWAY, MAKE A NEW GUN *HARPY* RIGHT AWAY. DONT WAIT FOREVER TO DO SO LIKE I DID. CRAFT AT LEAST ONE NEW PISTOL RIGHT AWAY, THEN SAVE UP FOR A HARPY!!! DUEL WIELD WILL HELP FOR A LITTLE TILL YOU GET YOUR HARPY!!! DONT BUY ANYTHING TILL YOU HAVE 2ND PISTOL AND THEN THE HARPY! GOOD LUCK, MAKE SURE TO GET TONS OF WOOD AND STONE MINE!!!

Objects can fall through floors but the workaround is keep your brab (grip button ) held down when opening boxes and blowing up rocks (gotta aim high, were the stuff spawns)

I managed to get it to load a couple of times but afterwards it would randomly crash and put up a black screen, it would still be playing the audio though no graphics. It's not stable at all and to fix it I'd need to restart my PC.

Please fix this random crashing bug as I'd like to play the game.

I have a Ryzen 7 1700 CPU, 16GB of Ram and a GTX 1070. With a Rift S. Running on Windows 7 (Operating system). I am not running SLI either.

2022-05-28 12:20:52.974458,CarloFromMilkyWay,I agree: that Captain's butt is awesome,"Seeking Dawn is a special game. It is an ambitious project, with a small brief initial introduction, a simple tutorial incorporated in the early stages of the game, pleasant too, a set of dialogues in English that reminds me games with a much higher budget, a good integration of the menus , some beautiful game mechanics, fun animations for weapons and tools, very simple crafting. The maps are quite linear but never give the idea of being idly conceived. The player proceed without having so many alternatives on a fixed path but can very well imagine being on a huge planet. The boundaries of the maps are plausible and well integrated into the environment. The views are varied, with huge monsters lying lazily on mountains, giant jellyfish flying in the sky, planets with rings of asteroids, etc. The graphic suffers from a sort of ""graininess"", as if it were poorly defined, but can be fantastic with “ultra settings. In my PC, with a GTX 1080 and 32 giga of ram this title runs smothly and is sumptuous. The music reminds maybe Mass Effect for the synth bass line, and it's simple. Does not bother. It is there, to underline the phases of action. Sometimes it is not well synchronized with what happens in the game, as if the developers expected our look to be directed towards a specific point that we may not yet have discovered. In few words this game is AWESOME. In general it seems to me that the developers have really invested many months/years of work on Seeking Dawn, and that their passion to produce an experience comparable to those of much more publicized and well-known titles can be seen in many small aspects of the work. I am satisfied with the title, I am happy that there are people capable of producing something so sumptuous in the Oculus Store. The limits that I have noticed are completely negligible. This is an example for all developers who want to sell products in the Oculus Store.","Nov 21, 2019 at 8:33 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 12:20:56.110662,Maestronomic,,"A decent sci-fi adventure that is very impressive for a Chinese (pardon my bigotry) developer. I may have to explain myself here, but so far asian developers have not impressed me (yes, I'm looking at you mortal blitz and unearthing mars 1 and 2).
So why only three stars?

The fighting is not very good. You mostly point, shoot and back away (or wait enemies out because of bad AI).
There is no melee / grenade system.
No cover mechanics (except in some cases cave walls).

These three factors actually make the combat feel a bit two dimensional, although it is in a virtual space.

I am 3-4 hours into the game and there have been no meaningful conversations with anyone, so those expecting a npc dialogue heavy rpg may want to look elsewhere.

There is not much handholding in the game, which I actually appreciate because it reinforces the cosmic Robinson Crusoe vibe.

All in all I am very impressed with how well made this game is and the sum is better than its parts.
Would not recommend it at it's full price, but if you like to explore alien worlds, then this is surely worth the price when on sale.

2022-05-28 12:20:59.261328,Max_Immelmann,an average game,"1hr of game play in.  all in all, i liked the game.  the reason for only 3 stars is as follows.

combat is just shoot, retreat, repeat.  though some creatures appeared from different directions, including up, which i liked, combat is very generic.  so far, every creature i have fought just charges straight at me.

when i pick up items, i have no idea what i am picking up most of the time.  have to go to inventory and look to see what items have been added.  some times i do see a word flash by, like ""chitin"".  perhaps having the name of the item appear with the white ""pick up"" circle?

the helmet just seems......clunky???  had to fiddle with settings a bit to get it adjusted correctly to my face.  i can not put my finger on it, but some thing just seems ""off"".  maybe get rid of helmet graphics and just give me a HUD display?

this last reason may be on me, but i am running an i7 9000 series cpu, an rtx 2080, and 16 gb of ddr4 ram.  graphics just not there for me.  they are.........ok.  i could run this game on my other, 7 year old PC.

this is a great game if you are new to VR, or have an older PC that runs minimum specs.  if you are like me and running a top o' the line gaming rig, your PC will not even break a sweat.  i would have been a bit upset if i had paid full price for this.  fortunately i bought it on sale for $9.  vader immortal E1 was $10, and was just a beautifully made game and got 5 stars from me.  this too could be a 5 star with some tweeking.  still, a good job devs.  keep poking at it, you will get there.

2022-05-28 12:21:02.410526,Diogenesis,Game is broken for me :( (UPDATE),"ive purchased this game about a week ago,
was really excited to try it out and see how it was, ive watched alot of youtube game play and thought it would be a good touch for my collection...
Alas, i can not play it. everytime i started it it would be stuck on the loading screen in the headset but working on screen (monitor), buttons wouldnt work and i couldnt actually do anything, it would stay on the pull trigger screen to access game, ive tried but didnt work, and ive uninstalled and reinstalled the gabout 3 times and rebooted my oculus  and even went as far as to mess with the files to get anything from it and nothing.

now when i tried to start it today, i get an error message (OVR25027186) stating that my game could not start, ive been wanting to play so bad but it just wont allow me, i dont have antvirus besides windows defender, and even then i havent had any issues with it blocking my games, ive checked the rules and outbound policies, its allowed, i just dont get whats wrong. its increasingly frustratin and i almost want a refund.

(UPDATE)
Yoko helped me with this a while ago and i forgot to update the review.
it works amazingly! turns out the game does not like SLI graphics cards, something about the configuration of the graphics is what cause me to have the issue above, so word of caution to anyone running SLI, DO NOT RUN SLI WHILE TRYING TO PLAY THIS! it will cause the game to run but no picture to come through the oculus.

I like the fact that not every creature is hostile and out to kill you...lol. Exploring the caves and various locations and having strange alien bugs and creatures just going about their business really makes the environments come alive and feel very immersive (like going on a  cool alien safari). It also makes it more intense when you do come across a hostile creature (I like that there's no constant background music and only key music beats/triggers during combat encounters only.

2022-05-28 12:21:11.931948,Acid44,A lot of Hellgate: London vibe here.,"I've played this 6 hours so far, basically not getting anywhere, but I don't tend to play fast anyways. This game is great so far. Comfortable movement and controls, great visuals (with a few small issues), ok story so far, Like I said, I play slow. 

Pros: 
Comfortable to play
Great graphics, especially the vegetation, most VR titles seem to lack veggies, which really irks me as I've been 3d modeling for years, and just gotten into level design. 
Fun gameplay. No Pavlov here, but I like this better TBH. 
The damage system coupled with the gritty/contrasty visuals give an amazing Hellgate London feel to the game. Seriously wondering if some of the same people are involved. 


Cons: 
Bloom Needs to be switchable, after a few hours it gets straining on the eyes. And I mean I just finished like a 2 hour session, so it takes a bit but does start to hurt.
Outdoor daytime lighting needs work, again related to bloom though. I can't read the menus or see the quick select objects at all in the outdoor daytime scenes, especially thinking of the first encounter with a big cat like thing here.


Update to add: A more open area would be nice as well. It seems like you'll get more as you go, but it all feels very linear as it is. It's open in the way that you can always go home, but at least so far there's not much of an actual open area, so exploration isn't really descriptive. Maybe discovery would be a better word","Jul 22, 2019 at 2:17 AM",4, 10,Thank you for your feedback!

I am a huge fan of these FPS games and the survival part of it was not as bad as I thought it would be. There are easily more than enough resources around to pick up and each time you go back to a map you have been to before there is plenty more resources available.

2022-05-28 12:21:11.984315,cereal_keller,"Has Potential, Too Arcadey and Grindy","When I saw the trailer for this game I got excited.  The trailer made this game look like it was going to have amazing graphics and be super fun.  It looked like it would be a PC version of Farpoint, which I really liked.  It kinda is, but not in the way I was hoping.  You're running around on this planet killing bugs and other animlas.  When you shoot things, it shows you damage like an arcade game, which I hate.
The graphics have the potential to be really good.  The game looks like it was a AAA title from 10 years ago.  A perfect showcase for what DX9 is capable of.  The problem is optimization, in my opinion.  I have pretty much the most high end system there is at this moment.  9900K at 5.4 GHz, 32 GB 4000 MHz DDR4, SLI RTX 2080 Ti's.  Of course there is no SLI, if there were it would make a huge difference.  So even with my system, with an over clocked 2080 Ti, I'm running the game maxed out with 1.9 super sampling in Oculus debug tool.  That's the best my system can accomplish before I start to drop frames.  I'm using a Rift S by the way.  So even with the complete performance of my system, the game still doesn't look that great.  It's kind of washed out looking and the textures appear low resolution.  If I could run like 3.0 super sampling, the game does have the base graphical appearance to look really good if it were possible to get the resolution high enough.  But as is, it's a disappointment.
The level design is really good.  It's very impressive in some places.  It looks like they were influenced by Mass Effect, Halo, maybe Destiny.
Combat is satisfying most of the time.
They have you messing around with mining and gathering resources for base building, which I also hate.  Boring!  I want to shoot stuff, not be interupted to gather resources between fights. 
It has potential, but as is, it's kinda meh. 
Add SLI support and better performance optimization, that's the biggest thing

I would like to see a mass transfer option to make moving several items into your storage easier. It does take up some time to clean out your inventory. Also, in regards to the storage unit, a sort button would be welcomed to stack like-items so I dont have to sort through them and find two of the same items then combine them together manually. I would like to see the forges able to pull items/ingredients straight from your storage while you are physically INSIDE your base (shouldnt work for turrets or anything outside your base). Just a couple things I want added but in no way does it hinder the game. I did get stuck in place a couple times because of the terrain but easily fixed by switching controls over to teleport and then back to walking once i was free.

2022-05-28 12:21:21.473315,SirCodes,"Fun, but Deceitful Trailer & Many Issues","I'm writing this review in April of 2019. First off, I will say that Seeking Dawn is one of the most fun experiences I've had in VR to date. That is, when it played well. The environments are amazing and immersive, I truly felt like I was on an alien planet. The guns are actually all very unique and offer a fun twist on traditional ""point-and-shoot"" VR games. The boss fights are where this game shines, especially the last two boss fights. 

Still, this game has many problems. First off, the trailer... yea, that is a complete lie. After finishng the game and rewatching the trailer, I was stunned. The trailer is so unlike the game itself that it's honestly insulting. Many of the environments and I think even some enemies from the trailer are not even in the game... what the heck? That's so not cool. It also sucks that the game only includes NPC's in the very beginning. There was so much potential to add NPS'c throughout the game that was completely wasted. The game is also very fidgety, from the quick select menu being way to close to your body, to the harvesting system making the frame rate drop for a few seconds. Enemies are also extreme bullet sponges, making the difficulty feel artificial and frustrating. 

Overall, I suggest looking up actual gameplay of the game, not the deceitful trailer. If your willing to deal with the semi-common occurance of minor bugs and immersion breaking frame rate drops, there is a great VR experience here; however, this game is overall another example of the potential of VR not fully realized.","Apr 5, 2019 at 6:31 AM",3, 29,

Really great environments which often led to me feeling slightly panicy.  The gameplay/story would be about 4/5 stars for me.

However, there is a craftable melee-gauntlet and craftable shield: holy freaking crap it feels so so so so good.  The final boss fight--using those two weapons for me--felt like everything VR should be.  My heart was pounding.  I was dodging attacks with wide motions; dodge under a sword, then uppercut for critical hits.  That final fight/feeling made the purchase 100% worth it for me.","May 20, 2019 at 2:11 AM",5, 11,

2022-05-28 12:21:27.816051,Chakote,Fun to play with a friend,"Fun, and multiplayer works well (which is significant) but for the 45$ price tag the game simply doesn't provide enough lasting appeal or engage deeply enough with its content to justify buying it. Visually rich but overall shallow and  forgettable.

Once you build the 3 main crafting stations and look though their recipes, you have seen the whole game's crafting system from start to finish. There's nothing at all going on in terms of depth.

Updated review: More recipes for buff items have been added to the game which fleshes out the crafting system a bit more. It's a nice improvement and it adds a lot. Second playthrough was more enjoyable than the first, although it still suffers from the same shallow, slapped-together feeling that plagued it the first time. Gunplay gets old quick and often devolves into how quickly you can empty your magazine. These are all minor quibbles, the game looks great and these things may not bother you if you just want to shoot things. The continued engagement of the developer is a huge plus, I genuinely believe this game will continue to get better with time. Changed to 4 stars from 3.","Feb 28, 2019 at 12:04 AM",4, 7,

2022-05-28 12:21:30.956266,jamisonmiller,when Halo meets Avatar!,"Updated Review: I Increased my rating as it seemed a little unfair for just 4 stars. the deveopers are clearly working hard to keep the new updates coming! The content doesn't fail to impress!

This game is a visual marvel! with a very awe inspiring world to explore (which just got expanded which is fantastic!) The new master mode is a nice touch (don't know what the point of normal is anymore but anyway :D ) with weapon upgrades and such. noticed however enemies are a bit tougher and still laugh at my bullets...

From a personal veiw here is what i'd like to see to make the game perfect-er;

- A realistic game mode: The whole leveled enemies thing is super tiersome for me anyway, having to unload masses of lead into my enemy's faces and have them still come is totally immursion breaking. and the only counter to this is stocking up on THOUSANDS of rounds by destroying trees and empty you clip into everything you see. I'd rather an ammo penalty for realistic damage than this system.

-replayability- with the world expanding, it would be neat to have more than just the one long quest, Making the world open and free. adding a new game + mode so you can keep your weapons and upgrades would also be nice to keep the ball rolling.

-More interactivity- the real game differs greatly from the trialer in the aspect of interactivity. i am not overly a fan of having sticky guns stuck to my hands (holsters would be nice!) and in this game items are glued to each hand (you can't interact with weapons like the scene in the trailer where he pushes the button on the side of the weapon) Things like this would give the game a little more depth. turret quick placing (also in the trailer) would be a nice addition too! And physical reloads of weapons would also be awesome!

Overall, this game is amazing! You will find it like an adventure like no other! Quite alot of play time too, and if the expantions keep comming like the recent one. you will definately get your money's worth!!!","Nov 22, 2018 at 10:58 AM",5, 30,

2022-05-28 12:21:30.990176,VerandaPanda,Accept the bugs and save often,"To get the most enjoyment out of this game, adapt to the programming bugs and save often. The worst bug I have encountered is when I die or 'quit without saving' I will lose a weapon or other inventory. Do it a few times in a row and my entire inventory will be gone, including ammo and teleport gun, stranding me and putting me basically at the begining of the game, equipment wise. Avoid this by quitting the app via the Oculus button and restart to re-open a saved game. If you attempt to re-open a previous save point via 'quit without saving' the autosave simply locks you into any inventory deletions, erasing whatever number of hours of advancing done since the last 'good' save point. So manually save often.

It is tough to find a balance between graphics turned up enough to see above an N64 era game (ok, maybe Sega Saturn), and having a normal frame rate while running or during combat with 2 or more enemies. I have read about issues since the last update, but now I see what they mean - stuff is turned way down, but frame rate is still low. Compared to all other titles I have, this one has given me the most issues with balancing graphics.","Jan 11, 2019 at 12:39 PM",2, 4,

- woodcutter animation sound far too loud. Can't hear anything when it's active. Tone this down a lot. 
- I noticed a graphical glitch when I tried to change the game graphics from high to custom, everything started to ghost. Was really hard to focus and has to kill my Rift, seemed to carry the glitch over to Oculus home after it happened. If it's on high it's fine.

2022-05-28 12:21:37.258699,RuneSR2,Beware of patch 2.0! - How to fix it ;-),"First of all after patching to 2.0 I experienced severe image ghosting and I thought that the patch was to blame - now I'm not so sure. At least after updating from Oculus v. 1.32 to v. 1.33 I was able to play the game with no image ghosting, and I was able to use super sampling (pixel density) 1.6 - all settings maxed, but without antialiasing (could turn antialiasing on without problems, but it didn't do much using ss 1.6, so I turned it off). Maybe the Oculus Update 1.32 caused the severe image ghosting, not the Seeking Dawn 2.0 patch... Also note that using Forceware 417.35 may be quite important and part of solution to eliminate any image ghosting in Seeking Dawn. Thus in case of image ghosting, try to use the latest drivers for your video card. 
Patch 2.0 seems to include heavily downscaled  resolution - probably the reason why 2.0 performs so much better than before, but it looks horribly pixelated - at least until pixel density is set to at least 1.4. But you can only set pixel density to 1.2 in-game, so how to get 1.4 and beyond? The pixel density value in-game is multiplied with the Oculus Tray Tool value - that's how I got ss 1.6, but you need to do the math ;-)
Also when the game works, Seeking Dawn not only shines but outshines all other VR games I can think of, even Lone Echo - although mostly when it comes to the gameplay and graphics (the story in Lone Echo is still second to none).
Seeking Dawn still has long loading times and could use further polishing, but it's the most awesome world, it truly feels like being on an alien planet. Sometimes I don't even care about playing the game - I just like to be present in the world - to walk around and enjoy the scenery - it's that good.

2022-05-28 12:21:37.276652,deejm2112,"Good game, nothing ground breaking","I'm updating  my review since I left an unfavorable review.

My Oculus game client was stuck and would not update to the most recent version. I had updated my nVidia driver and that broke several existing games so I thought it might be something else. I researched the fix and found that if you download the Oculus game client, run it and select ""Fix"" it corrected it and updated my client to the latest version, everything works again, including this game. 

It's a decent first person shooter, very doable, picturesque alien world and intuitive game play. Also so far nothing new. Good purchase, this is what I wanted, something I could jump in to and play and not get stuck.","Jan 2, 2019 at 9:29 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 12:21:37.293606,SparkyNinja1583,It's a fun and good game.,"I enjoyed playing this game! I would say it's good but not great.

What I liked: 

The graphics were solid and I loved the different atmospheres! Devs put a lot of work into the detail trying to immerse you in a living breathing alien planet. The sound effects were also pretty cool. I felt immersed. I liked the different weapons. Each one's unique but nothing gunna blow your mind here. I liked the mining and gathering tools. Using them was fun but sometimes it felt there was little point. I liked the crafting system and the stuff you could make at your base it just sometimes felt a little unused. I liked the helmet details to make it seems like u have a space suit on. To be honest though I tirned it off half way through so I could get a better FOV. 

What I felt was ""meh"": The story. I couldn't tell you 1 character's name. Basically you're a dude that's sent to this planet to look for a small team that the home base lost contact with. Discover why they disapeared. In the begining they write out this whole paragraph of back story. You could skip it and wouln't matter imo. A lot of the enemy AI wasn't very good. Big enemies that would normally be a challenge were easily blcoked by terrain or the enterence to a cave while you blast them in the face. Enemies that are far away are easily picked off if you've got a somewhat steady hand. You need to eat food and drink fluids. I get the whole survival aspect but this was more of an annoyance. You basically have to have 2 quick slots taken up all the time because of food and beverage. Lastly, SAVE OFTEN. You can totally get stuck and your only option is to quit the game and go back to your last save. I almost rage quit at 1 point because this happened to me more than once.



Final thoughts: You can tell the devs put their hearts into this game. That goes a long way with me. It was a good game and I would recommend it for the experience and immersion. I waited for a sale. Up to you!","Dec 17, 2018 at 11:11 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 12:21:37.311559,VROneUK,Got bored quickly,"This game was boring... saying that, I stopped after about 20 minutes of game-play. I couldn't bare it any longer. I can see this game could have potential. The graphics are nice, sound is okay, just no game-play at all really. I was hoping something a little like GunHeart, but it doesn't come anywhere close. Personally I think the developers just decided that it was time to launch it as-is, UNFINISHED. Shame really. I won't be playing this again until there are some major updates and a point to the game-play.

Graphics on meduim 1070 gtx and i5 7500 3.4 ghz.  My system has played every vr title, until this one.  From what I saw, the game will be good in the time it takes to work out some issues... for now save your money and wait for the updates.  Or perhaps the dev should offer a discount until the game is bug freeish.
** UPDATE*** 11/24/18
After seeing the 40% discount and being contacted by the dev. about getting help setting up game, I decided to give the game a try again.  Still not perfect but playable.  graphics on Medium and prob. needing more tweaks.  The game breaks the vr experence between/when loading scenes.

2022-05-28 12:21:40.420838,YourVerda,Fantastic FPS,"This game is great! First person shooter with a story line to follow.
The only down sides to it in my opinion is that its hard to find where your going, sometimes you'll be told by the mission board that you have to "" Search the caverns "" for example, but there isnt a marker to show you which cave to go down. 
unless your a zombie that only plays a game 24/7 you'll find that this game isnt a short one, the story can take you a while to play through which is a plus for me, its hard to find a game on VR that will last

I played co-op for several hours with a friend, and we both ended up feeling like the game was a bit tedious, the shooting mechanics not very satisfying. 

There is a base building mechanic, but the stretches of time that you're chasing the objective marker are LONG, and a lot of boring resource collecting as the only available activity between regularly spaced clusters of dumb enemies.

The most interesting experience we had was a random fight with a chimpanzee which seemed to occur with no context.

With the exception of that fight most of the enemies appear to be bullet sponges, the story is weak, and the voice acting is mediocre.

It's redeeming factors are nice visuals, and a solid selection of locomotion options.

While I don't have any strong VR recommendations for base building, to scartch the itch of a Co-op scifi shooter, see From Other Suns. To get a more satisfying wave shooter, see Robo Recall.","Oct 30, 2018 at 10:44 AM",2, 6,"Hey LordMelkor,

2022-05-28 12:21:43.613414,UltimaRecon,Leaves more to be desired,"Its an odd game, looks great, plays well but its unfortunate they went the same route as other future games with auto reloading weapons and making them all 1 handed. Very few weapons, pistol, smg, shotgun, something that works kinda like a halo needler, grenade launcher, and some charge pistol. Game overall is about 8 hours or so, but I feel it was only that long due to collecting crafting materials, which the crafting is also very shallow. You collect materials from rocks and tree's to get a better gun from time to time and the rest is just used to make bullets when you run out. I feel like the game would be much shorter without the padding of of crafting added in, feels more like it exists soley for that reason as the game wouldn't feel much different without crafting or the hunger/thirst system. After beating the game and watching the trailer over again, looks like 1 or 2 enemies in it are never seen, and looks like an area in it you never go to either, essentially the trailer seems to show more than whats actually in the game. Overall it is a good game, its fun and plays well, pretty easy and short feeling though. Wouldn't say its worth it for full price.","Sep 12, 2018 at 4:42 AM",3, 7,

But accidentally i found out that i could play it MAXED OUT! I set graphics on ""custom"" and everything maxed and ""apply"". Then i went and put game graphics  on ""low"" and ""apply"".

Just what I feared. There is going to be a long time before this game is running correctly. The update did very little for Oculus users. Explosions, kills ,etc.. cause a painful amount of stutter/lag. The game does run a tad better after update but then BOOM and your holding your breath because your snatched out of the immersion and PISSED!

The game have lots of bugs actually but I think they all minor ones and I enjoyed the game so much I did not care a few bugs here and there.
Also I think its not well optimized at all. Even at max garphics some textures were terrible and literally see where they tried to cut corners to save some PC power and still had terrible fps drops not to mention after a while on the same map my fps dropped for no reason. I was gathering resources all was fine and all of the sudden boom fps dropped and never came back until the next map is loaded.
The next thing is the weapon wheel. OMG what a garbage that is. All VR games using quick slots placed on your belt, shoulder, back but not this game they forcing you to use that insanely bad weapon wheel which is alos bugged and often not working at all. To be fair its working when its set to simply touch stuff but you will often touch the wrong item and its frustrating as hell so eventually set to grab stuff from the wheel and that part is completely broken.

Load screens are long and ugly since the scene just freezes and that hour glass shows up. Sometimes I had to close my eyes or take my headset off to keep from getting a headache. 

I found the backpack unintuitive and had trouble making it work even as they were explaining it to me.

2022-05-28 12:21:56.372768,jac,"Too short, needs polish.","Final Verdict:

The game is too short, I got to the final boss around what I expected to be the halfway point. There are essentially 3 distinct tiers of weapons, each one 4-6 times more powerful than the last. This makes the pacing of the game very awkward as you can't quite afford the equipment for the next area, so its insanely hard, you get that last piece you need, then it is way too easy.

Overall, its an enjoyable game thats too short, too buggy, and poorly balanced.

Second update:

There are significant lag issues when playing online so that you take damage from a melee enemy who is not close to you. There is also significant lag every time you mine a resource and the resources themselves spawn. I have been kicked out a few times due to network issues, only to lose significant progress because the game didn't auto save my character. As in, I lost the guns I had bought and the resources I mined. The game itself is pretty and plays fairly well, but these are some pretty bad issues. Only not putting four stars because of the initial difficulty I had with the game.

Original post below.

Terrible menus, (accidentally exiting the game when trying to set options), can't get through the tutorial, stuck at gate that won't open. Eventually got the gate to open after leaving and reentering the game several times. Eating is much harder than it should be. At first, I couldn't get my character to eat anything, occasionally, it would play the eating sound without eating. Eventually, I learned I had to eat out of my palm. The first real mission requires better weapons than you start with, but you won't have enough material to make those weapons before you start, and the fast travel item isn't given to the user until after that mission.

This game isn't stable, it isn't polished, and it isn't finished.","Jul 30, 2018 at 5:12 AM",3, 12,
2022-05-28 12:21:56.395705,3DeMan,Flawed masterpice - but still great,"This game is quite simply one of the best VR experiences and graphically right up there with lone echo. It almost looks like the sort of game we would be expecting to play in the next gen, as the current blurry headsets really cannot do it justice.  I am also really enjoying the gameplay loop. Is it perfect? Graphically pretty much -
a truely immersive realisation of an alien world, both beautiful and unsettling at the same time. Sound is fantastic (except the 'monsters are coming' soundtrack kicks in at times for no apparent reason). Voice and script is its weak spot, at times this aspect can be quite dreadful. Gameplay - well I am really enjoying it - at the same time I keep thinking how wonderful it would be if they did this, or did that. 
So conclusions - a game that is simply one of the best graphically, but falling down with the script and voice 'talent'. Also let down by the perhaps over-ambitious gameplay that shows genuine potential, but does not manage to totally realize that potential. (I am hoping that this sells well enough for the devopers to hang in there and slowly work on this aspect).

My conclusion is this - something of a flawed masterpiece - but enough fragments of a masterpiece to be well worth you time and money. Oculus should grab the talent on this team, nurture it, throw some cash at them, hire some script writers and voice actors -  to allow them to produce the AAA game we are all waiting for. 

Note on performance - I had a horrible experience with screen tearing and framerate when I first booted it up - to the point that I was going to have to (reluctantly) return it. But I rebooted my system (I7/GTX1060) and it ran like a dream on medium settings. No problems since. 

To all those negative comments both here and on Reddit - man, I do not get it. I can only assume that the 'grumpy uncles' from the world of pancake gaming are sponsoring this as part of strategy to sabotage VR.

Everything around you shakes while you're walking and it's very hard on the eyes, it makes the game basically unplayable.

2022-05-28 12:22:02.667781,y4n0_Vh_Qc,Great but I found a game breaking bug,"The game is a lot of fun. There's people playing multiplayer online so its great for co-op. The story is also fun with entertaining conversations. Some stage are short but some are also medium lenght (I haven't done the game yet I'm at the 9th stage of the game). I went to the third level with a co-op partner. In that mission you need 2 different tools to mine or you simply can't complete it. I took a farming tool and my partner took the other one before he left without doing what needed to be done next leaving with missing a tool that is called woodchucker to be able to complete the mission. I spent a lot of time not understanding what was going on why was I stuck to finally watch a walktrought online that made me see what the heck was wrong so I tried everything that I could think of to be able to get that tool and nope the only thing I seem to have to do now is do a new game or go into a co-op game that is at least at the third stage and ask for your partner to build you one... which is probably better to just restart the game from scratch at this point anyways. I also got the black venom blinder bug at the 7th stage so I retryed and the second time it didn't come back but I know it will most likely come back... I'm giving 4 stars but I can't give 5 until those problems at least are fixed. I'm giving 4 stars because the game as so good extraterrestorial immersiveness that its making me think I'm Samus and to add to that the more I advance the more I love the game so I just hope its stay that way. The fact that they put some crafting(weapons, armor, nutrition, ammo, tools), mining and base defense construction in the game is also great and it help with elongating the game. I like the little survivor thing that your guy need to be fed. This game is among the best VR FPS experience I've add and I have quite a few FPS VR games. Adding a PVP multiplayer would also be very great but the bugs should definitely be fixed first.","Aug 3, 2018 at 12:04 PM",4, 6,

2022-05-28 12:22:02.738591,Drewskii88,Disappointing visuals and black screens,"After many changes to the graphics, brightness, and contrast settings (not to mention movement controls) the game is somewhat playable. Feels very unfinished in terms of graphics,story, missions, and exploration. I found myself advancing to areas where clearly I wasnt suppose to go due to not having the misson ""selected"" which definitely needs a major overhaul as similar games allow for more than one active quest/misson to avoid such confusion and how this game handles it is just bizzare. This is the first game that my system cant smoothly run maxxed out and I dont believe it has ANYTHING to do with my hardware as many others have complained about graphical bugs/ stuttering and most frustrating are the random black screen flashes that totally break the immersion of VR and often times causes you to get killed.  The game has potential and it will remind you of Halo mixed with Mass effect. I really hope the Devs fix the graphics and framerate stuttering but mostly the stupid black screen flashes or Frame skips/drops that occur on every setting. I more than meet the min spec req and if Lone echo,Robo Rekall, etc can run great at max settings then It's how little optimization went in to this game. Please fix and spend time correcting the various bugs and the hazy watered down color palette. Those who are saying its the best graphical game on VR is most certainly wrong and sadly looks nothing like the early gameplay footage shown months ago.","Jul 26, 2018 at 7:04 AM",3, 6,

2022-05-28 12:22:05.859389,Cendrix,Multiplayer is too much fun,"So I've been playing for this past week...
This game is beautiful for one. I've never been one to care for the graphics much as long as gameplay and mechanics are comprehensive but the work put into this game is immense. I'll leave it at that.
You can make a game, save it, then reload your character (not your base setup) joining another players' world. If you get items and invest in their world, you can save it as your own and still keep your own mission progress for if you reload later. You can play with a group of 4 people total. I like to go back and help new players and watch them get excited and spooked over cool parts of this game, and kindof re-experience it. If i could give 4 1/2 stars I would. I get connection issues that kick everyone from the game when someone joins at times, or else it would be 5 stars.

P.S. (To #devs) 
Also, I've gotten all weapons besides one and it would be nice if any of these could have secondary fire as well (besides the shield). Also, when using climbing features while holding the shield you deploy the force field, since that's the secondary fire. Not sure if you want to modify that. And the venom spitter weapon, while neat in functionality shoots so slowly and awkwardly I feel that this is one that needs a secondary fire for me to want to use it. The only time I use it is when I don't want to do too much work when playing early missions with newbies. Thanks for your hard work!","Jul 23, 2018 at 1:42 AM",4, 6,

This is clearly a game made with a lot of love, but has some serious issues. After playing for a day, I really hope the devs address the infuriating bugs in this game. I want so much to love this world, but it feels like most of the issues in this could have been addressed before launch. First few hours were awesome, then it became unplayable. Maybe wait on this one.","Jul 15, 2018 at 9:32 AM",3, 10,
2022-05-28 12:22:05.895294,Azkrayus,,"I would give this game a 5/5 star however there is still alot of glitches. I cannot complete the game due to the vision on Oculus Rift goes pitch black. It never started doing this until i was in the final level. its starts as a black dot that rapidly spreads until all you see is black. This isnt the only glitch though. There has been plenty of times while exploring ive just died for no reason. Some of them im guessing it is out of bounds issues but if thats the case. Shouldn't out of bounds be out of bounds?! I shouldnt be able to just walk out and die. 
Overall even with these complaints its still an awesome game and i hope more is added to it. If these glitches were fixed it would easily be a 5/5 rating. Not being able to complete the game cause the final boss makes all your vision black doesn't cut it.

But, game runs just fine, even scalling is 1.5 and antialiasing turned On, textures are on High settings. 
Things what i hated: 
- No pause button even in Oculus menu your life drops, so if you want to go into toilet, better save and exit the game.
- Being thirsty every 5 minutes. In reality when you drink water you are not thirsty couple of hours and its really annoying being notified every few seconds being thirsty. Its like you dont have time to explore anything, only running all the time trying to find a water.
