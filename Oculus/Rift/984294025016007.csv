Graphics are beautiful, but then what? This should be a free demo, or at MOST a buck 99. Maybe friends had hyped this too much. Disappointed. Fairly seriously disappointed. UPDATE: Thye more I think about it, the more miffed I become. This is pretty close to an actual ripoff. This was my very first Oculus Rift purchase. I will be extremely, extremely careful about buying other titles. I am really kind of ticked off.","Sep 12, 2018 at 5:30 PM",2, 16,

2022-05-28 14:36:02.758659,nightcat.mau,Awesome!,"This experience isn’t at all what I expected. Remember when IMAX came out and we were all impressed? This reminds me of that. You get three experiences, one on a reef, a whale encounter and the deep sea floor. Each encounter features beautiful sea life that will interact with you at times and each play through unlocks new experiences like the ability to slow time, take photos or go at your own pace. So to unlock everything takes over half an hour and that to me is plenty of time to enjoy each experience. You can also toggle the music off and on and there are neat interactive surprises I won’t ruin for you. Well worth the full price, I’m happy to support a dev who stuck around to make the experience better.","Jul 31, 2018 at 8:04 AM",5, 4,

However, VR is all about experiences, and this is a cool VR showcase experience to share with family & friends to showcase VR.

2022-05-28 14:36:05.876962,Lanzaboy,So very very good,"Human nature dictates we read the bad reviews first.  So I thought that this would be an all too short non-interactive experience that didn't run correctly on my rig. Yet, I find an endless interactive experience that runs flawlessly in Win7 (admittedly on a GTX1080ti). The whale is great and the reef is absorbing but the abyss is my favourite - as it unfolds. The interaction is as much as you would get if you were on a reef or in an abyss (but sadly crushed to death before you could interact in the latter) . The fish scatter should you try and touch them and anemones shrink. Even the jelly fish wobble to the (oculus) touch. The reef is great but a little stylised and some of the fish behaviour isn't natural to the species but hey don't you love the way they swim up to you. Two requests; the ability to rotate view to help with tracking and some clarity on the inspector and ambience controls for the touch controllers. So very, very good.","Mar 13, 2018 at 10:23 PM",5, 7,

2022-05-28 14:36:05.911869,Atomic_Kayaker,Unwatchable - now spectacular,"I'm writing this review to see if other users have had a terrible experience.  I have I7-7700, GTX1080, Win10 (creator's update) system and playback stutters and clicks terribly.  Have open ticket with Oculus but all they have suggested so far is uninstall and reinstall.  Running theBlu off SSD.  Performance monitor shows system running unchoked.  During stutter/clicking getting hourglass on image.  I would love to be able to see this as designed but simply no good for now.

I run Acronis True Image as my archiving software.  The package has ""Active Protection"" which is supposed to do good things.  Out of frustration, I turned Active Protection off and this app now runs flawlessly and is spectacular.  I've raised my rating to 4 as it is definitely a good watch, but not an interactive experience.","Feb 25, 2018 at 12:19 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 14:36:09.019710,XtremeHardcoreGamer,I wonder why I didn't buy this sooner.,"This experience is now my defacto show off VR to newcomers after First Contact (especially older folks). The attention to detail, animation, graphics, is top notch which creates great immersion for the onlooker. The climaxes of all the scenarios made the people I demo'd this to pause with no words to describe what they were seeing.","Jan 20, 2018 at 11:40 AM",5, 4,

But when people say this experience is short, they are not kidding. theBlu isn't just short -  it's *insanely* short, as in under 10 minutes. 

That said, if you pick this up on sale, it can serve you well as a VR tech demo, but IMO, this is not worth $10.","Dec 8, 2017 at 3:34 AM",3, 12,

I often revisits just to relax - and you'll find no better way to show friends or relatives why VR is so fascinating. There are 3 scenarios to enjoy - and these scenarios are not just movies, I consider each experience like art, it's that beautiful and the developers' creativivity is simply impressive! 
Using GTX 1080 it ran perfectly using supersampling 2.0. Now if only Subnautica had graphics like The Blu... Sigh... ;-)","Nov 10, 2018 at 5:38 AM",5, 0,

(and BTW, I just discovered the Slo-Mo button option - now you can nearly stop the fish and other creatures and walk up to them and examine all their INCREDIBLE detail more closely.

2022-05-28 14:36:37.530230,greeneblitz,Excellent,"I love this VR app, it is short, the whale is only like 2 mins but is super impressive and realistic, The other 2 are longer 10+ mins, know going in what it is and isn't, its not a game, its barly interactive and theres nothing to do, however its one of the best expeience I have ever had in VR and definitly a must show for VR demos. Seems totally worth the $10 to me based on how many times I have just sat back and relaxed under water. Can't wait for season 2.","Mar 26, 2017 at 3:19 PM",5, 2,

A stunning and very realistic underwater experience and definitely one to show your friends. The best part is.... more seasons are on the way.","Apr 5, 2017 at 12:52 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 14:36:37.560150,SanctusFides,1 Star for Price,"While this is sort of neat, it's absolutely not worth $10.
There are just 3 little ""experiences"" that are only minutes long each and don't really showcase much of anything.
There is no real intereaction nor does it really do much to make you feel immersed in the underwater world.

I would refund this if I could.","Mar 21, 2017 at 7:20 AM",1, 9,

2022-05-28 14:36:40.708056,Bel-garath,Love these kind of experiences,"This was just beautiful. You really feel immersed in what you are watching. There are 3 scenes to chose from. One is a whale which is quite short, but very well executed. One is on the ocean floor and was my favorite experience as it goes from dark to light. The 3rd experience is more serene and better suited for those that might get afraid of the first two, like my mother, who even before the whale came out she felt like she was suffocating lol. I really hope more things like this come out. A little tip for those who want to try this. If you watch the same scene a few times, it adds the option to stay in the scene indefinitely which some may find very relaxing. I prefer the ride instead as it is sort of like an event that builds up to what it is trying to show you.","Feb 1, 2017 at 9:26 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 14:36:43.841796,PapaZIRO,Is it beautiful? Yes.,"But is it worth the money? I suppose that depends. THe experiences are great. I do especially like the whale encounter. But in its current state, this experience functions best as a demo -- an example of what is possible with VR. 

To be honest, despite the far superior graphics and immersion provided by this iteration of TheBlu, I still prefer the two-year-old GearVR experience, because it seemed educational.

The question you must have is whether or not you should get this experience. I don't regret my purchase; it is only ten dollars, which is about the price of a movie ticket. But I could see how this might leave some people a little disappointed. If you don't yet have a really good experience to demo your headset with, this is a great choice. If you're looking for something that will keep you coming back again and again, you might want to consider spending your dollars elsewhere.","Dec 13, 2016 at 12:34 PM",3, 8,
2022-05-28 14:36:43.857753,the_tadosaur,Beautiful - but left wanting more,"Probably the most beautiful experience I've had so far in VR, but it's sadly so short. The whole experience sadly lasted about 15-20 minutes.  I'll no doubt re-play it again, but I expect the real magic is a one time only experience.  Hopefully there will be more content added as what is here is breathtaking!","Dec 26, 2016 at 3:37 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 14:36:43.873710,Tankshell,"Looks amazing, very relaxing","The best way to enjoy this game it to play through each scenario a couple of times until you unlock the 'freeplay' game mode, which doesn't impose a time limit. Then you can just load up a scene and chill out in it without worrying about the credits rolling, for as long as you like. I recommend loading the coral reef scene and then laying down on the floor and looking up at the water surface for a while. Pretty Zen!","Dec 11, 2016 at 12:44 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 14:36:47.036851,Netsuko,WOW! Just.. THIS is what VR is made for!,"Okay, I was a little sceptical when I bought this. I am a HUGE fan of the oceans but I did not expect to be blown away like this.

The moment you encounter the whale is when I actually teared up inside the headset because it was just SO overwhelming. I am usually not easily impressed but this made me just stand there, mouth agape.

The abyss scene is not less impressive... you just sit there and wave your flashlights around and more and more things happen. It felt like I was Jake from Avatar, wandering through the bioluminiscent forrest.

I wish there was more. But MAN, this was worth the money. Believe me, THIS is the thing you want to showcase to your friends.
