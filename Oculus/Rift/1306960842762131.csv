If you complain about getting sick, then why the hell are you playing an ""intense"" rated game? It's supposed to be like real life.

2022-05-28 19:22:03.896977,wirelitesoft.dev,VERTIGO PRE-WARNING,This game will give you really bad VERTIGO. And if you ate DON'T play because you will get sick. It was a good concept but not something for VR. Only part that did not make me sick was the rollercoaster and the ferris wheel. the haunted house part made me sick when it turned. it does not turn smooth and this made me dizzy. all of the other rides made me so dizzy I had to get out a Scopolamine Patch and put behind my ear just to overcome the Vertigo.,"Jan 19, 2020 at 8:05 AM",1, 6,

My Initial Thoughts:
Does what it says on the tin. This felt like a mediocre experience. The  Graphics are bland and basic and I think this is as result of a straight port from the Gear VR. No more effort has been put in this experience to benefit a high end VR system like the Rift S which is a shame and comes across as lazy by the developers.
I did feel a bit sick at times and after 2 years in VR this is a bit unusual for me but I did have a nasty cold. headache, sore throat etc, so this was probably the worst thing to try in my condition...... but hey, for science right!","Jul 5, 2019 at 12:10 AM",2, 15,
2022-05-28 19:22:10.152247,nightcat.mau,Great To See This Park Ported To Rift,"I bought this game on Steam ages ago and the rides got me through many a winter day shut inside. The graphics kind of remind me of the 80s and 90s and it has quirky charm. I like them, but if you want fancier graphics, keep looking. This game is more about the rides.

The rides themselves are as simple as actual park rides were decades ago, so don't expect coasters that fly or go underwater. As an older gamer I appreciate the old style to be honest and was pleased to see it ported over to the Rift. The rides can make you dizzy; most involve spinning or dropping you, or both, so keep that in mind. 

It's a bit buggy atm, I get the Renzo Racer splash screen, and it is now indeed your menu butoon to recenter, but overall it's still the good cheap fun (now free) it always was. 

I'd still love a train ride though, and other folks on steam had mentioned being able to freeroam the park?","Jul 4, 2019 at 8:35 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 19:22:10.167207,The_Eleatic,Nauseating.,"I added this to my library because I was trying to develop my ""VR legs"" and wanted to try an experience rated as ""Intense"". 

That may be the only real use for this unpleasant, clunky experience. It's not so much ""intense"" as just badly designed and executed.","Aug 9, 2019 at 8:17 PM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 19:22:10.183164,StevoVonBrown,buggy but also made me felt sick,im just like everyone els i dont get sick to easily in vr but this app game did the job. not my cup of tea and wont be using this app ever again. the only thing that worked well with me was the roller coaster but thats about it. i could not handle the airplane thats what drew the line with me feeling sick at that point.,"Jul 11, 2019 at 6:19 AM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 19:22:10.198124,Spalman_yt,Vomit inducing,"The graphics are good, since it's a free game. But the overall production is just horrible, if not one of the worst. I never felt like I was actually at a theme park, the atmosphere just does not built up, as in Summer Funland for example. The rides are spinning at EXTREME speeds at times, the turns on the rollercoasters are super rough and unnatural, and the scaling is completely off on some rides (for example, the seats on the plane rides are very tiny, while the horror-ride wagon is way to big.) The shadows were also completely missplaced, which resulted in a distorted §D effect. Also, you hear the ambient sounds of children speaking and laughing, but you are the only one at the park.
I am usually resistant to VR Sickness, but after being 15 seconds on a ride, I just felt completely nauseous. I tried every ride though, with opening my eyes at brief moments only. The different scenarios are a cute plus, but seem unnecessary. The constant promotion for the kart game was also annoying.
I definitely won't play it again, and I would not recommend this for ANY new VR players, but since it's free I am gonna give two stars for the idea, the acceptable graphics and the interesting rides, but not 5 because of the poor execution, it seems as if this game was never actually tested on a VR Headset, but seems like it was intended for screen-gaming.","Jul 17, 2019 at 5:30 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 19:22:10.213084,FastLawyer,"It's free, what did you guys expect?","I actually bought this game on the Steam store (and already own Renzo Racer). This version has a Mexico and Old West theme that weren't there before! Yes, you can ride bumper cars while listening to Mariachi music and if you hit pause you'll hear a good 'ol GRITO (look it up kids!) You can also do loop de loops on a Old Western Themed plane. You guys remember planes back in the Old West right? They called them flying horses back then (or alternatively Iron Unicorns in San Francisco). Anyways, you should NOT be reviewing VR games if you get nausea or motion sickness. Seriously, it's a you problem because 0% nausea here. Yeah the graphics are bad, but some of the rides are actually pretty cool. I got a thrill out of it.","Jul 13, 2019 at 10:39 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:22:13.325759,Tamerq,Its OK,I have tried the Rollercoaster... the fact that there is a music that is irrelevant made the experience poor.. it would have been nicer if the developers had the amusement park sound effects more visible.. shouts that could increase on the steep corners...
