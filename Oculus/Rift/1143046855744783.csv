2022-05-28 14:06:21.358730,pepito.diaz.bestone,pretty good !,"im a math fan, so i surely like that app its basic but well render ! if this can make young people being interested in science i am 100% for it work it work other app like that i will always promote it the way i can ;)","Apr 27, 2021 at 12:39 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 14:06:21.373690,NotaHumanResource,Transcends Von Neumann's ergodic dreams!,Have you ever dreamed of steping inside self replicating numerical hydrodynamic and quantum statistical mechanical fields? Do you desire to reflect and refract linear and parabolic primary colors into parabolic beacons of hope for the deep hive mind? Then this is the experience you have been waiting for! I was at first skeptical that the contributors of this game would fail at such an arduous task as formulatic addessimation breakdown and re-formation but they definately pulled it off with this game.  This game was the missing jewel in the crown for me in helping me to solve a trajectory problem that I have been working on for years.  Unfortunately I have calculated that a meteor in the MACS0647-JD galaxy is most certanly going to hit the earth in the next 3.97 billion years.,"Dec 15, 2019 at 2:50 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 14:06:21.388650,happyhippie924,Huge potential,"This app has a ton of potential, its really amazing to manipulate calculus in VR. I would like to see the addition of constants on the keyboard with sliders on the side to manipulate them to see how the shapes change in real time, as well as just general improvments to the keyboard and textfields. The truncating textfields were very frustrating to work with.","Jun 9, 2019 at 1:52 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 14:06:21.403609,DreamerO,Hear me out on this,"The experience gets 5 stars for what it is -- A 3 dimensional visualization of mathematical concepts. The ability to play with, scale, and interact with different functions not only give you a greater appreciation of mathematical beauty -- but also a better understanding of how variables impact a function with a visual reference. 

I would love to see an update to this where people can share their favorite functions (like a downloadable section)","Mar 18, 2018 at 4:10 AM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 14:06:21.419567,MrMaclovin,Use the wrist menu to return home,"Since several people here didn't find it, here's how to return to the main menu: 

There is a circular button on your wrist. Using your other hand, point and click on this button for one second. This brings up a menu that lets you return to the beginning.

Five stars for the impressive visualizations. I especially found the vector dot product example really eye opening. I would have liked to see more pre-defined functions to choose from in the scenes that use the calculator as input. As a non-mathematician, I don't recall interesting three-dimensional functions off the top of my head. Instead I'm stuck exploring the one example function that is provided with each experience.","Feb 12, 2018 at 12:44 AM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 14:06:24.535360,FastLawyer,It was free,"I think the app did what it was supposed to do.  I messed around with it and soon realized that although I took calculus in both high school and college ... that was many years ago now and I have no idea what most of these concepts mean anymore.  So there just isn't much point to this app for someone who isn't up to date on higher mathematics anymore.  I'm giving this app 3 stars though for apparently delivering on what it promises, although I have no way to independently verify that.  I can confirm it worked in 3D and there were graphs involved :D","Nov 27, 2017 at 6:23 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 14:06:24.550320,sressler,Fix the UI,Very nice concepts but the UI is so confusing and couldn't go back to main menu..making it highly annoying! Should be easy fix.,"Dec 15, 2017 at 3:47 AM",2, 4,
2022-05-28 14:06:24.565280,Waynosan,Rating based on the price (free),It's free and a great demonstration of mathmatical visualization.  I couldn't figure out how to go back to the main menu so had to keep quiting and restarting.  Definately would like to see this expanded.  It could also be a great learning tool if it walked you through what's going on and provided some background calculations.  Cheers!,"Dec 10, 2017 at 2:41 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 14:06:24.580240,DonkeyKongUh,Really incredible VR graphing,"Worked great, pretty intuitive. I think right now it only grazes the surface of what's possible, but can't wait to see this expand. Being able to see the cross product as you drag around vectors is oh so satisfying, and lots of really cool parametric presets.","Nov 20, 2017 at 12:55 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 14:06:27.667589,3DNate,,"An expansion or sequel would likely earn 5 stars. It is just not much content, and the parts that include a calculator are annoying to use with touch controllers.

It is basically quite good though and will hopefully be further developed","May 16, 2017 at 2:42 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 14:06:27.684544,guruflorida,Loved it.,"I would like to see more visualizations, and perhaps ones that are more commonly known. I think this is a demo of what future data analysis will be. :)","Mar 4, 2017 at 1:05 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 14:06:27.700501,tproffen,Simply awesome,This is a wonderful demonstration for 3D math and VR. The app is simply great - all it is missing is some alien planet background while playing with the functions. The interactions with the Touch are superb!,"Jan 3, 2017 at 7:04 AM",5, 16,
