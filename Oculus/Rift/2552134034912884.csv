2022-05-28 20:46:36.197382,Blake_c123,Have fun at your own risk,"Is and will be a great game for most people. But if you are even slighty prone to motion sickness, this isn't for you. I gave the game a high rating because it's not fair to the developers to complain about something that's not their fault.","Jan 1, 2021 at 12:19 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 20:46:36.213339,UnLicensed_camera,Best skydiving simulator so far!,"There are some things that need some work (content wise) 
But I know they are working on that and it will change soon, the physics are on point and if you're looking to learn how to fly a parachute this is the closest thing short of actually going skydiving and flying one !","Dec 12, 2020 at 8:34 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:46:36.227301,Dsgnr_81,"short, dull, meh.","Limited areas, landscapes incomplete, no ride up, no out the door, just under canopy then landing. In short, dissapointing.","Jan 5, 2021 at 10:41 AM",2, 3,"Hi, thanks for your feedback. We are constantly updating the game with new features and environments and by listening to user feedbacks. We've added many new features including free fall, jumping from planes and buildings and more."
2022-05-28 20:46:36.242261,premiumdays,Great skydiving simulation experience,"This game is so much like skydiving!  It's so cool to be able to skydive in your living room and be able to see a fully inflated parachutre abovee ytour head whiule you're trying to manueve safely to the virtuial ground, it's a lot of fun!","Dec 19, 2020 at 10:11 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:46:36.257221,frank.pellerin,Incredible!,"As a skydiver, this is the closest thing to reality in the virtual world! Love it!","Dec 16, 2020 at 9:42 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:46:39.369896,skyamirv,Wow!,As a skydiver I can say this is the closest to the real thing! I’ve tried other simulations but none of them come close.,"Dec 20, 2020 at 12:24 AM",5, 2,
