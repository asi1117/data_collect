With friends you can try to play for the highest score but after a really short time it gets too repetetive. I refunded it therefore, because it has no content to play it again. An Online Multiplayer with different modes (PVP, or a Coop Mode where one Player has only certain parts and the players have to throw the cats at each other to ""repair them"" fully) would be realy great and would make me pur(r)chase it again.","Jul 12, 2018 at 4:03 AM",3, 3,

Upon buying the game you are met with a warning about your play area, and sure enough I didn't have enough room. However I found a trick to change my location in the game using Oculus built in 'reset view' option.
This game is great looking, fun and quirky as you try to cure disfigured cats in the quickest time possible.
If you like challenging, time attack style games you may get a lot of fun and enjoyment from this. I got a similar 'Job Simulator' vibe from this but a more cut-down version in terms of longevity.
Maybe I didn't play it long enough but I would love to have seen a lot more variety and quirks.","Jun 16, 2018 at 1:16 AM",3, 5,
