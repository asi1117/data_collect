Not sure what's up with that and if it's just a isolated incident but it kinda sucks to have wasted money on something I can't play. :/",Dec 12 at 3:50 AM,2, 14,

2022-05-28 17:03:35.948222,HousePainter,"Unfortunately, extremely meh","Really hoped I would like this a lot more, but ultimately I'm just glad I only spent a few bucks on it.  It will probably appeal more to some people, I don't think it's an awful game, but it's definitely nothing special.  

One major annoyance was that my neck got sore very quickly from having to crane back and forth, up and (especially) down in order to highlight things or perform actions.  Felt like the game was making my chin reach for my belly button all the time, and my neck is getting sore just from thinking about it.    

The control scheme is poorly optimized for VR, and the graphics are very lackluster, which left me feeling like this game would play a lot better on mobile.  

I'm not sure if this game was originally intended to be only on mobile, or just primarily for mobile, but there is absolutely no reason to play this in VR.  It's a very hum-ho experience, but if you played it on mobile it would probably be fantastic.... ""for a mobile game"".","Apr 8, 2021 at 7:21 AM",2, 74,

Game is unplayable without sound.  Developers - can you help me out?  If not, I'm going to request a refund.","May 5, 2020 at 6:05 AM",1, 54,
2022-05-28 17:03:39.103783,mdrejhon,Five stars for subtitles!,"Hello! Deaf gamer here. I need subtitles. 

The best subtitle systems are the ""Republque VR""-style gentle floats, or the ""Red Matter""-style wrist mounted pipboy equivalent. While I prefer the pipboy style approach (glance at wrist, backscrollable), 

The captions are a pleasant surprise, but more deafies would buy this game if they knew this had subtitles! Oculus Store gets docked 1 star because it does not have a ""Subtitles: Yes/No"" field like SteamVR does.  I heard that some group at Gallaudet University (deaf university) is considering a lawsuit to Oculus to humbly request Oculus to make a minor change to Oculus Store (a Subtitles Yes/No checkbox) to get them inform deaf gamers whether a VR game has subtitles or not.

But five stars to Republique VR!  Republique goes the extra distance to make floating gentle and non-nauseating.  Five star kudos.","Feb 3, 2020 at 1:24 PM",5, 186,
2022-05-28 17:03:39.118743,ParadiseDecay,Metal Gear Solid Vibes in VR!,"My initial impressions:
A highly polished VR experience that gives you a Metal Gear Solid style vibe. 
You play the game from a top-down style view using CCTV camera's and your main role is to stealth through the game completing missions.
The game appears to have lots of replayability, with plenty of things to find and collect. 
I'm not normally a fan of these types of games but found myself playing longer than I had anticipated and it has an impressive list of known developers behind it.

2022-05-28 17:03:39.133702,JohnInAk,Games Broke!,"Can't get past the first door in chapter 5 because the game says I need to have an upgraded omni even though it was just upgraded. This stinks.   
I have sent support the info requested although I can't do a screen grab as I have no idea how to do so with the oculus. IN any case,  I'm close to the end of the game and the only option it would appear I have is to start ALL OVER AGAIN! This really stinks. When you get to chapter 5 be careful and DONT SAVE THE GAME AFTER YOU CHOOSE AN OPTION! Otherwise you WONT be able to finish the game.","Aug 15, 2019 at 2:07 AM",1, 41,"Hi John,

2022-05-28 17:03:39.148662,RuneSR2,Nice game,"The game feels more like some sort of point and click adventure. You control a person seen in 3rd person perspective, but you can't move your game character directly - instead you point where she should go and then she goes there. Feels more like a 2D game on a big screen than VR. The Rift version has many more polygons and better textures than the Quest version, explaining the relatively high hardware requirements. That said the game worked at solid 90 fps using GTX 1080. There're no in-game settings for graphics, use Oculus Tray Tool to improve super sampling.","Aug 12, 2019 at 2:30 AM",4, 49,
