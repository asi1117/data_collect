2022-05-28 20:01:15.013761,J2_,How I feel about golf +,This game absolutley knocks my socks off. I come home from my lectures and I throw on my rift s and just grind away! I love you can change the locations of shots on the clubhouse and take what you've practiced to the 4 courses on there now. When I want to kick back I join topgolf with my friends or play pro put and this game is DEFINITLEY worth the money.,7 days ago,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:01:15.028721,markrj,Actually helping my real game.,"At first I thought playing golf in VR would have a detrimental effect on my real life golf game. After 30+ rounds in Golf +, I am actually playing better in real life. 

The physics seem to be very accurate in my experience. 

I am waiting for my Quest 2 to arrive. I am currently playing on a Oculus Rift-S and the graphics are very good on the Rift-S",7 days ago,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:01:15.043681,DrGNOLA,Best Overall Golf Game for Q2,"Best golf game for Q2, and quite likely the best reason to get into VR if you're aren't already. The devs and community are great and new courses are added all the time: Wolf Creek, Valhalla, and very soon Kiawah Island in addition to the base courses. Not to mention all the other golf options (driving range, YouTube jukebox, etc) you get for the money. I've played them all so far, and enjoy and appreciate many of them, but Golf + is the clear champ and so much fun to play. Multiplayer works well and it's the closest you can get in VR to being on the course with your friends! Thanks for the great game!",7 days ago,5, 2,
2022-05-28 20:01:15.058641,FERRIZOG,Perfect,"This game is perfect. This is the best golf game on the market and it's not even close. It's super realistic and extremely fun, i've played almost 50 rounds now and have not gotten bored. The only downside is the few course options, but, I assume that will change in the future. Perfect game I would recommend to anyone who loves golf.",16 hours ago,5, 0,

2022-05-28 20:01:18.206310,Gordotronic,Awesome,"Awesome game. The controls are extremely intuitive!  Gotta get the handicap down now!

Update: After playing this game for months, I still love it.  It can double as both an excellent video game and a super awesome golf simulator if you can find a good controller attachment you like. The physics are still amazing.
Also, the developers are extremely active; constantly adding new courses and adding the knockout mode was pretty sweet.
Even if you don't golf... you will still enjoy this game, and might actually develop an urge to start playing golf. This will hold title for best VR game for a really long time!",8 days ago,5, 1,

Also looking really good for the future, with PGA partnership possible and what appears to be ongoing free and paid DLC golf courses coming out fairly regularly.  Very realistic physics, and still fun to play.  It started off as a not-super-great putting game, but has developed into a great, complete game of golf.

This golf game is the best Christmas present I could have bought. It's the next best thing to real golf! All the sweet features like TopGolf and multiplayer just make it even better. Bravo to the staff who worked on this and here's to future updates!

Update 1/16/2022: Having now spent over twenty hours since purchase swinging away, my love for the game has only grown. Devs are very responsive to patches and interact with their community. Hosting friends in the TopGolf room and Clubhouse golf rounds is an awesome experience! There is a learning curve like real golf but worth the grind  ;)",Jan 16 at 10:14 PM,5, 84,

2022-05-28 20:01:30.892805,MadMaxToo,Yay,"When I first stumbled across this game I thought YAY, a nice looking VR golf game, and then I saw only for QUEST and went BOO, and then recently discovered it available for my RIFT S and went YAY, and played it and I was only as good as my real golf and went BOO. I played NOVICE level and I was a superstar golfer getting 18 under and went YAY, and played AMATEUR and got 18 OVER and went BOO, but now I am improving my game and managed an even par round so YAY. At some point I will turn PRO and we know where that's going, DON'T WE?

Anyway, this truly is an amazing golf game, in fact the best computer golf game in the history of golf games, at least in my experience and I've been gaming and golfing since I was about 12, and I'm 60 now. Just buy it, it is a no brainer, really. I've just learned there will be plenty more mostly free courses coming as well, so no excuses.  I don't even need to mention other aspects besides the full course part of it to give it 5 stars.",Feb 15 at 8:45 AM,5, 19,

2022-05-28 20:01:49.895188,loregnum,Awesome game!,"I have had this since it came out on the Quest and have enjoyed it over that time. Once the full course mode was added in, I kept hoping that it'd get a Rift/PC version since the increased resolution on PC would be very beneficial for full course golfing. Don't get me wrong, the full courses look impressive on the Q2 given the hardware powering it yet added clarity is always welcome, especially in something where you are looking hundreds of feet into the distance like with golf. Well, they said they were going to release it on this platform so at least Q1 users with streaming ability would be able to play the new full courses and what a surprise that it was already released since I was expecting it maybe sometime in mid-late January at the earliest. I've tried it out and the improved clarity is great and is exactly what I was hoping/expecting.

I do hope in time they tweak this version (especially if/when they release it on Steam) to better utilize PC hardware as right now it basically seems to be the Quest 2 version but with a higher render resolution though even if not, I'll be very happy to play this version given it still looks very good.

Anyone that has even a passing interest in golf should own this game.",Dec 25 at 6:57 AM,5, 21,

2022-05-28 20:01:53.024488,Slick1984,Updated Review,"The tutorial auto-start issue has been fixed.

The game plays well, although not many courses to choose. The options of Tee box, Wind speed and Green speed make playing the same courses, somewhat different and challenging. 

It was formerly Top Golf, so there's that.

It has some sort of long putt course called Pro Putt, but it really needs just a regular practice putting green. Being able to select the green speed, in which to practice, would be appreciated.

tldr; Needs more courses and a practice putting green.",Jan 10 at 6:34 AM,4, 9,"Hey there, Thanks for taking the time to leave feedback. When at the clubhouse you can teleport anywhere down range at the clubhouse, open the B menu (Y on the left controller) and select ""place ball"" on the left to drop a ball anywhere, including on the greens.

I've loved every bit of this game since it was introduced to me. I'd go as far as to say a must have game if you own a VR headset.

My only complaint as this has started recently with new updates to the game is the following. When I search for anything through Media -> YouTube while playing anything which has that functionality like TopGolf, I am met with a spinning background search animation and nothing more. No results come up.

Youtube search functionality:

The only workaround I can come up with is using the Web functionality and playing the list though there. Unfortunately using that route I am not able to adjust the volume, make full screen, skip to next songs, avoid ads in between. Kind of immersion breaking.

2022-05-28 20:01:53.089819,illusion112,A VR legend if pushed to PC limit!,Since the day I first strapped my quest 1 on and stood in awe just drawing on the glass in half life I knew this was special. Soon after bought a Rift-S and a Quest2 and own all the AAA oculus games- VR sports challenge is great but where was  AAA golf game? VR is Taylor made for Golf and literally only one game made and it’s pretty rough(Golf ClubVR) This is the foundation of that Tiger Woods pga tour game I so wanted! My one plea with the devs is please work on the PC version! I bought it the second I saw a Rift version had been made because immersion in Golf is huge and Quest2 just isn’t capable of that in regards to stuff like expanded physics-actual grass-foliage in real volume-weather-galleries-licensed PGA players as ai(imagine walking along Tiger or Phil up 18 Jesus inVR)I know the PC market is now far smaller but don’t know what else to say. It’s a travesty no AAA golf game was ever made especially when zuck was writing blank checks-I just hope and plead you can find the time to make the rift version that game I always hoped for I feel like the tech is there to really portray real golf and if you guys indeed make more than just the mobile port it is I will support this  game ill buy every dlc known to man you have my word!

The other issue I have is the way the avatars look? im on a Rift-S and they all look like some deformed aileen mine included there completely unrecognizable as avatars. But other than that this is a GREAT game good job dev team!,Feb 10 at 12:28 AM,4, 0,"Hey BIG_CV, Thank you for taking the time to review our game!

2022-05-28 20:01:56.244001,Themjem,It's really close to actually golfing!,"Before I get into the minor details I do definately recommend this!
The good:
Runs great, feels good when you hit the ball right
Decent graphics
Great HUD and controls
The bad:
The golf clubs don't have any movement like a real one, it's very stiff but pretty accurate.
When you accidentally hit a ball while setting up it acts weird and adds a stroke if you're playing a course (Not the devs fault)
The Oculus controller is pretty small compared to a regular golf club so it's quite awkward and if you swing wrong it could hurt (like real golf!) I think you'd have to buy an extension to get it more accurate, which I plan on doing.",Jan 2 at 12:44 AM,4, 5,

2022-05-28 20:01:59.353770,StayTropical,Amazing Game !!,"This game is Amazing! 

The gameplay is next level, you feel fully immersed in every aspect of the game Putting, Chipping, Driving and picking what shots to play!

It's great that the game allows you to get into a full round of golf and interact with strangers from all around the world.

In the future i would love to hopefully see some customizable features such as club changing, being able to choose from different brands! i think this would be great and would make the player feel even more immersed. 

Some ingame tournaments where players could win ingame money from placing in tournaments would be great and then being able to use the winnings from the tournaments to purchase ingame items such as new clubs and clothes. 

Cant wait for what the DEVS have in store for us in the future! 

Great Game and i highly recommend this game to everybody wether you are skilled or novice. 

5 stars",Jan 14 at 1:25 PM,5, 2,

I've recommended this to a few fellow gaming golfers and anyone I have spoken with that has played the experience before also says that it immediately picked up on their habits and shot patterns.  The topgolf mode is also great fun, I've never had the opportunity to go to a real life topgolf but I certainly will when I get the chance if it's anything like as fun as it is here.

The absolute icing on the cake is that the devs allow you to cross play across Rift and Quest 2 using the same account, so only one purchase. I have a mate coming over who is a golf nut and I can't wait to show him this. 

I can't wait for more courses to be added, I will buy whatever the devs release. Thank you guys for your dedication in creating this gem of a game.",Mar 11 at 10:00 PM,5, 0,

2022-05-28 20:02:08.907630,Red_Go,Right slice is killing me...,"I enjoyed this game so much with quest 2 and golf controller.  I offers a lot of contents and good physics.  It can't be a substitude for screen golf but it has its own benefit and advantage.  But!!! there are huge problems for me I wish to be fixed soon.  

First....  slice to right direction is a real pain in the as s when using golf grip controller (with most of fast swings).  I can play only novice level because above that the ball goes way too right, almost 45 dgrees to the right....   It doesn't happen when using just controller, but with golf club controller it always happen.  I tried so many ways to fix it but nothing worked so far.  

Second, graphics of PC version is way better than quest version. The gap is too obvious that I can't go back to quest version once I played in PC.  I have no idea how VR games work but why not make quest version's graphic same to PC version?...  (PC version is still less than 3GB size which I think not too big size for quest game).",Jan 19 at 10:08 AM,4, 0,"Hey Red_Go, thank you for leaving us a review! The pc version is actually a direct port of the Quest 2 version and thus has no additional assets compared to Quest 2. The only difference is a slight bump in clarity. I highly recommend joining our player community over on Discord- discord.gg/golfplus  We have tons of helpful players of all skill levels that would be happy to play a round with you and maybe diagnose the cause of your slice. There is also a wealth of information on youtube in regards to fixing a slice in real golf that you can follow along with in game. I'd also be happy to take a look at some replays at chance@golfplusvr.com"
