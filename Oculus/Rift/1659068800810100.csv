2022-05-28 19:45:08.879667,Quietgamer5,Needs Work,Great idea. However I was able to walk through rocks and sometimes screen would go wonky. Controls could be better too. Looking for updates cause it looks like it would be fun to play.,"Dec 22, 2020 at 1:37 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:45:08.901608,Fragman05,Immersive escape,"Using flashlight to see clues helps a ton. Lots to explore and interact with. Sword kills hog, but not the cat beware, throw the rocks. Fluid experience, 3 sensors in my set up, so tracking is dead nuts. Puzzles require some thought but all can be solved. Very fun and worth the effort, looking forward to more from this group","Apr 25, 2018 at 11:15 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 19:45:08.925544,OctoMan912,Lots of cool interactive puzzles,"This is a change from the ""shoot a bunch of enemies who are rushing at me"".   This is a very immersive puzzle game.  Everything seems to be alive. For example, I was dumb enough to play with the wasp nest and it got pretty crazy.   You can really interact with your hands.  I walked up to a giant tree, and yes, I was able to climb it with my hands and when I let go of it, I feell and died.  Duh...  Walking around with the thumbstick is a big plus.  

I never got ""stuck"" and if you find the flashlight, you can shine it around and sometimes find clues. Someone wrote up clues in invisible ink to help ""us"".  OHHH, if you don't like puzzle games or you are super into shooting games, you might not enjoy this title.

There is a way to change the settings to see better graphics, but it is hard to find. (Check out your watch. You can change graphic settings in it).","Apr 23, 2018 at 8:37 PM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 19:45:08.950003,mmgood428,Worth the ride,"This was a fun escape puzzle game. Absolutely recommended for the price. Graphics are almost real, but best of all, i was able to interact with stuff and it felt like a real island.  Very fluid movement.  Puzzles were decent and somewhat difficult, but not impossible. Second level was better with the cliffs. My only complaint is if you die, you have to restart the level.","Apr 20, 2018 at 5:37 AM",5, 9,
