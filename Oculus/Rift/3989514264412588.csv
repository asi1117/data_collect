2022-05-28 20:08:25.073121,D3L7A1,Freaking Awesome,"I remember playing a game just like this WAY back in the day. So I have some rose colored glasses but i'll tell ya this is just awesome. I love the single player missions and the simple reward system. Nothing flashy. Many modern games add all kinds of BS that is not historically accurate but this game sticks with it. 
  I am still messing around with the multiplayer so far I get my butt kicked but i'll get better. Love a good old fashioned skill based game. 
  Be careful if you get motion sick with this one. I have pretty good VR legs but riding backwards as the tail gunner was a stretch. I would have to turn around in my chair and watch the pilot to get settled. Super fun addition to play with friends though. 

A must have VR game in my opinion!",Nov 5 at 6:28 AM,5, 17,
2022-05-28 20:08:25.088081,x_Darthdude_x,Knights of the Sky in VR :) (A must buy),"THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC!, I'm having an absolute blast with this game, reminds me so much of knights of the sky back on the old amiga, one small niggle tho, I can't make the yoke setting stay, I have to set it during takeoff, flight and landing (3 times) aside from that the game is perfect, plus it looks great on both pc and quest 2, which surprised me quite a bit, definitely a must buy, I hope the devs see this so they can hear my prayer for them creating a WWII game in the same vane, go on y'know ya want to XD",Oct 27 at 10:34 PM,5, 6,
2022-05-28 20:08:25.103041,b_hinch,I'll Be Keeping Oculus Because Of This,"Oculus is kind of cool but my whole initial experience  has been ""meh"" and I was having a little buyer's remorse.  I saw an ad for this on Facebook and read the reviews so figured for 15.99 on sale I would try it.  Unfortunately I was charged full price because the discount code didn't work, but enough about that. This game is fantastic! Once you get a hang of the controls it is a fun and great experience. Someone else mentioned putting a fan on you when you play - as silly as it souds that was a great suggestion! Makes you feel like you're in an open cockpit, looking around you for adversaries. Can't speak to the motion sickness claims as it is not a problem for me, but the experience is realistic so I can see where that could be a potential problem.  Have barely scratched the surface of this game but can't wait to dive in. This game alone makes me glad to have the Oculus.",Jan 2 at 12:16 PM,5, 7,
2022-05-28 20:08:25.118001,jamesleegte,Fantastic Arcade Shooter,"This is a great first step for anyone getting into VR flight sims to help you decide if you have the stomach for it or not. 
Touch controllers are well thought out and make the game accessible to all! 
If HOTAS support was added for the PC version, I think this would be the ultimate newbie VR flight game on the market. 
It’s very arcadey and very easy to jump straight in to and start shooting down enemies.
Nice progression system of manual controls to ease you into it, so that no new pilots become overwhelmed by it all. 
I’ve spent hours flying around and having lots of fun in this. 
A must buy for anyone who enjoys flying and dogfights!
Well done devs, very cleverly thought out control and progression system and a very fun and satisfying arcade dogfight game.",Aug 7 at 1:41 AM,5, 17,
2022-05-28 20:08:25.132961,WyRaven,if you like flight sims dont buy this,"great for someone who's knowledge of an airplane consists of, it has wings and and a sticky thing to turn and nothing more. the combat is clunky at best, with the enemies having super planes that can climb forever at any pitch and turn at any rate while never loosing speed. You have a weedwacker motor attached to two paper wings, making the game play difficult as a result of bad game mechanics.","May 23, 2021 at 10:37 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 20:08:28.248755,Sodacans91,Great little flight sim,"I've been craving a good touch controller compatible flight sim, and this definitely scratches the itch.  A tad repetitive, but the core gameplay loop is fun enough that it stays interesting.  Great range of difficulties, from super basic, easy controls, all the way to realistic aerodynamics and punishing enemy difficulty. Definitely worth the $15.","Mar 20, 2021 at 1:09 AM",5, 37,
2022-05-28 20:08:28.263715,pepito.diaz.bestone,top dog fight,this is a fun game doesnt matter if your good or not at playing games many different modes for every difficulties disire ! if you like a long story mode game it isnt that but if you like dogfight you gonna past lots of hours playing that perfect one !! have fun piloting lots of old bird. as a pilot i just love it verry realistic control and grafic or not to bad i really would like 5to give a 6 stars to that verry immersive game ! buy it this is a low price perfect game !,"Mar 26, 2021 at 7:48 PM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 20:08:28.278675,StormRising,Outstanding VR must have.,The game play is incredible. The movement is smooth and accurate. The flight mechanics in both realistic modes and arcade are fun and not fustrating. The feel of being in a WW1 Fighter or Bomber is very strong.  Great all around game. One of the very best I've experienced in VR. I would give it a full 5 stars but the textures on the models seem a little simple and low-detail. This takes away from the effect just a little. Other than that the game is amazing. Highly recommended.,"Apr 4, 2021 at 12:37 PM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 20:08:28.293635,makispatrinos,"Beautiful, I recommend it",Simply thrilling! I always wanted a WWI airplane game in VR and this one is incredible and verry immersive. It is doing great use of the vr mechanics and is very lightweight as a game (I wonder how they made such a nice looking game with such small install size ),"Mar 18, 2021 at 9:29 AM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 20:08:28.307598,CrunkBob,Arcade Flying in VR?,"Wonderful arcade flying game that you will spend hours playing! Upgrades are not too hard to achieve, nor or the planes you really want to buy. Excellent with friends! Don't play for too long or you'll burn your eyes out! <3","Mar 23, 2021 at 12:39 PM",5, 11,

2022-05-28 20:08:31.423431,Beans1985,This is what I’ve been looking for!,"I love this game so much!  It certainly fills my need for the WWI era planes, and the difficulties are nice and balanced. I’m eager to really sink my teeth into this one!","Apr 29, 2021 at 10:14 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 20:08:34.591566,Roc4me,"Great, but it won't work thru Oculus","I bought this game thru the Oculus store but it won't start, it just kicks me back to the home screen.  I thought it was my PC, but I tried the demo via Steam and that worked.  So, I bought it thru Steam and that works beautifully.  I'd rather run it via Oculus but it just won't work for my Rift.  No idea why.  Anycow, great game.  Once I got used to the controls it's immensely fun.  Game=5/5   Oculus program= 0/5","Mar 19, 2021 at 4:52 AM",5, 7,
