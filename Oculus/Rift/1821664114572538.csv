Only way I could hear the game is through my stereo speakers and not my oculus headset. I tried looking for for and option to fix this but couldn't find any. Hope that this is fixed in the next update, if there is one.","Aug 16, 2019 at 10:34 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:32:24.338720,KhanCity,"Good concept, but buggy & no analog turn","I started playing the tutorial but it starts me off facing the opposite direction, couldnt adjust or use menu for recentering, so had to manually make 180 turn to see the targets.  Then, a lot of object barriers like rails, pipes, or anything thats thin, causes my view to shrink down to 3ft after making contact.  Again, tried to recenter, no luck, had to restart the level or checkpoint. Finally, please give us a free turning locomotion option with right analog stick.  I do have 3 sensors but turning by using your body/head with a tethered device is a nightmare.  Just asking to give us that option because I do like the game and would like to continue to play it further.  Thank you","Jan 3, 2018 at 10:48 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 18:32:24.354677,ccdeltabeta,"A Fine Start, But Consider the Following","1. During the only accessible level (not the training level), I could not seem to access the main menu.  Pressing any button/trigger could not get me to the main menu.  Had to back out to main Oculus Lobby to quit game. 2 - Movement using the arm motion is a novel idea, but its implementation seemed inconsistant. I used the recommended movement on the main menu. Sometimes it felt like I needed to pump my arms a few times to get moving; other times I tried depressing the thumbsticks while swinging the arms, and seemed to start moving faster. 3-After I thought I stopped pumping my arms to move, there were multiple times where I continued to move for a few seconds (wound up kissing a lot of walls that way). 4-There were times I wish I had some thumbstick locomotion option (i.e. turning/strafing) when I was in a corner, or trying to peek around a corner. I could work around this, but if you have a small roomscale set-up, this could present issues (e.g., bumping into a couple walls in my house, by constantly moving/turning before pumping my arms to get moving again) 5-Right after the first save point, I found myself able to stick my head through the wall next to the door, and take out the robots with my gun. 6 - During the 2nd stage, I got too close to a pillar and fell to my death, next time I sunk into the floor, and couldn't get back up (insert Life Alert joke here). 7- Could not find an audio volume adjustment level; your default volume level is a bit loud .
I did have a fun time for what I played, and while buying an EA game is risky, your arm-swinging movement was too intriguing to pass up.  To phrase it badly: your arm-movement locomotion feel a bit 'grid-based', compared to dual-thumbstick locomotion (e.g., Killing Floor, Arizona Sunshine), but hold out hope for forthcoming improvements (if you feel these comments have any merit).
I'm sorry for writing a thesis paper here, but figured a review of 'it's cool' or 'it stinks' wouldn't be helping anyone.","Sep 21, 2017 at 3:46 PM",3, 12,"First off, I really want to thank you for such a detailed review. It's feedback like this that helps us as we build our game out of Early Access! Wanted to also answer you on a few of your points above. Regarding point 1) Accessing the menu - can you try pressing A or X button? The main menu should then come up on your left hand. Point 2) & 3) try swinging your arms and gently pressing forward on the thumbstick to move forward. Regarding the ""move for a few seconds"" that is a deceleration method, we implemented that is required for arm-swinging to eliminate any chance of potential motion sickness. Now, when you want to fully stop, if you stop swinging your arms and remove your finger from the thumbstick you will stop on the spot, you won't have that ""gliding"", (almost moon-walk!) kind of feeling. 4) You do have the thumbstick locomotion system which you can select from the main menu (but glad you went with our preferred one!) Point 6) Can you provide more details on when you ""sunk into the floor""? Trying to understand what happened. These comments definitely have merit and are more than welcome! One more thing - we are pushing an update in the next few days that changes the controls whereby rather than having click once, click twice, we will be using the grip to hold and let go of grip to drop weapon control system which is more intuitive for Oculus players so look out for that and let me know what you think! If you can drop us an email on info@gamecooks.net - would love to continue this conversation and get more feedback! Best, Game Cooks team"
2022-05-28 18:32:24.369637,trautna,It's unplayable with 2 sensors,"I know it's made for roomscale setups, but since i have no place and already bought the game i really need the possibility to turn around with the stick. That's all. The locomotion works great, but without the snap turn features (turning 90 degrees when pushing the stick left or right) it's totally unplayable.
I hope that this feature is coming soon in the future since the game looks really great and i would love to play it.","Sep 24, 2017 at 9:12 PM",2, 1,"Hey Trautna, thanks for reaching out! Have you tried putting the sensors diagonally? Even with a very small space it still works. That's the setup we have here at the office. It would be great if you could give it a try and let us know! Feel free to reach out to us at info@gamecooks.net to discuss this in more details."
2022-05-28 18:32:24.384597,AnthonyGay,Very nice game,"This game is very fun. Jump, crounch, climb and shoot, shoot and shoot again. Only four star because of the graphics which are cool but not amazing. Very nice game, a must have.","Oct 14, 2017 at 1:51 AM",4, 0,Thanks a lot Anthony - really appreciate your feedback and glad you liked the game! Feel free to send more comments to info@gamecooks.net - we are still in Early Access and working on improving the game so suggestions are mooore than welcome :)
