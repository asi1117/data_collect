2022-05-28 20:39:07.776746,Willard007,Bus didn’t bring more folk to my city.,"Update 2: ok, I figured it out.  There was a house hidden in the middle of my first power cube area that was not decorated.  Immediately, after decorating it, the bus went crazy bringing in folk until it caught up.  Nevertheless, it should not expect you to decorate the first house built before it will send a bus out to bring in a folk for another house.  It would be nice if you had an information panel that would show all the buildings and their current state so you could find which ones need decorating and what the others are decorated with so you can decide which ones you need to build for a specific race to have access to a home, a stamina, a speed or a skill building.

Next is the the issue of not allowing a building to be placed in a valid spot.  It happens when you press the Y button.  It undoes your last placement and it will no longer allow you to put at least that type of building in the same place.  It may actually not allow you to put anything in that place.  This is extremely annoying.  I just found the perfect place for a building and want to place a walkway to connect a door.  I press the Y button to bring up the build window and schloop, it sucks back in my perfectly placed building and will not let me put another one in the same place.

It would also be nice if you could enhance the info panel to show what job folk have so you can determine in which jobs to place more of them to keep things running better.  What exactly does a defense shield operator do?  Is there a specific reason you need more than one of them?  Why do you need more than one meteor crusher operator?  It seems to me that one is able to keep the hopper empty and the ground littered so the warehouse workers cannot keep up before the flying saucer comes and cleans it up for you.  It might be nice to have a worker that would gather meteors that are within reach and put them in the crusher and maybe allow the crusher operator to turn on a meteor attractor to suck in any meteors within close proximity.  Is there supposed to be a power station worker?  Why do the rocket booster workers lose their hat when they realize there are not enough of them to start up the booster?  It might be nice to have a job for some folk to pick up the discarded items that all folk seem to drop for some reason or maybe have the folk leave their souvenirs in their house.

Update 1: have finished all goal-based levels and have been working on a Sandbox level.  I have 2 folk each of 3 races and have found at least 3 more races but no busses are going out to pick them up.  I tried the workaround mentioned in my original post at least 3 times and could not get a bus to venture out.  I have 2 more houses built for each of those new races as well as another house for each of those which already exist in my city.  I even demolished what I thought was the oldest of the vacant houses and built another.  I realized that I had missed decorating one house but rectified that and still no busses.  Is it possible to block the bus station so it won’t function?

I also found that the large banana skin decoration will not cling to anything.  It is acting as though it’s anchor is facing the wrong direction.

Another bug seems to be, if you place a building in place but pull it out to reorient it, it will no longer be possible to place it in the same place.

On a previous level, I accidentally did something which left a building with no way to anchor in place.  It seemed to be that I placed a builder near a door and he started building it but the building somehow got knocked out of place before the builder was finished.

I have also accidentally moved a folk into space where I could no long pick him up but I found, if I put a park under him, he would walk on it and I could maneuver the park repeatedly until the folk took purchase on a part of the city structure.

Original review:
I saw a posting on Reddit where at least 2 other people were having the same problem and one said they saved and exited and reloaded the game, which fixed the problem.  I tried that and it did not seem to work for me the first time but it did the 2nd time.  I should say I am using the Rift version with my Quest via Air Link.  There also seemed to be an issue connecting items to the lower part of my city where they still had access to the power cube but that was in the same area where the first unoccupied house finally kicked into gear and asked for decoration (which it did not do prior to the 2nd reboot).  I do like this sort of game, though, and hope you keep up the good work.",Mar 7 at 3:05 AM,3, 0,"Hey Willard007!

2022-05-28 20:39:07.792703,Masamune5454,wow super fun.,"reply; good im glad your going to improve it. right now the juttering and jittery stuff performance wise seems priority. it seems theres a point where it starts it, and i dont feel that im that far when it happens. like i placed 4 or five homes, 3 meduim facilty and warehous and refinery when it started, and i want to build a city like 500 buildings or something. agian that also lead to the need for more clouds and building potential. it seems to be over as soon as you get in a groove. also idk what stock means on facility. is it two races or two units? but i would def love to see this game get deeper and more buildings. since theres races it would be cool to have race specific jobs ect. like book people could run librarys and shcools, space lover can have a huge telescope and research center ect. just thinking..

update; it does seem to stutter some when the levels get complicated. im not sure, i have 2070 super with 8700k so i can play any vr. maybe graphic options or optimization would help.

i love these creative games, and this one is actually deep. the only thing i would want is more content, structured content to be exact. like some more narrative missions, maybe some more stuff like new resources. also some options and things like scaling size would be nice. you move the world with your hands. which agian a hand size option would be nice, maybe some interactiveness with the world and characters.
all in all though its really well done and is a total reccomend. it came out thin air, but im glad it did.",Nov 1 at 6:05 PM,5, 5,"Hi Masamune! Thank you for this review, and also for the comprehensive list of suggestions! Performance is something we're trying to stay on top of and was a focus during development, but it's true that it would be a good idea to incorporate some kind of graphics settings. Your other suggestions for the gameplay were also great... we also have a long list of gameplay improvements we're hoping to be able to make, so we'll definitely take your suggestions on board as the game grows!"
2022-05-28 20:39:07.806666,seths_ma,love it,"personally, i really like it, theres only one thing tho, (idk if its just me or if its a bug so if its me then sorry)  with the power buildings, im not sure how to make more or get more of those lighting clouds, i tried for a while and no matter what i did  i couldnt figure it out. maybe a tutorial in the beginning or maybe its just a bug? again, sorry if its just me. i might have not played it for long enough, but i still love it.",Nov 19 at 5:47 PM,4, 0,"Hey seths_ma! Thanks for the review, and so happy you like it! 👋 As for the power stations - you're doing it right! 💯 You can only have one power station per power cloud, so for the earlier scenarios, you're limited to a smaller size city with just the one or two clouds. Later scenarios feature more clouds for larger cities (although the game isn't really designed for SUPER MASSIVE cities, as you get in traditional flat-surface city builders). Hope that helps, and thanks for playing!"
