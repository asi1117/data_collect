Truely get the feel of living in ricks house with the cast of the show. The game does take a lot of computing power to play smoothly, I had to upgrade my video card to get it into a playable game. Don't go by the minimum VR requirements.  Longer game than I expected for the price. Definitly worth the price. Very happy with this purchase.

2022-05-28 13:02:56.390419,JoelSwanson,ROOMSCALE ONLY!,"This game, like many,  say ""Best with room scale"".  It isn't BEST with room scale.  If you don't have enough room, you wont be able to even get started.  You cannot actually move.  Where it puts you is where it is centered.  You cannot navigate with the controllers.  You cannot pick up things from a distance.  You must walk to a wall, select a disk and put it in a dvd player and press start.  If you are not able to do that you won't be able to start the game.  I could just barely make it.  Then, I was put inside of a washing machine, and rick and morty berated me for about 5 minutes because I couldn't easily open the washing machine and wash some clothes while in the washing machine.  Love Rick and Morty.  Would have loved the game with joystick movement.  Maybe you get it later on.  I don't know.  It was too frustrating to continue.","Apr 4, 2021 at 11:57 PM",1, 20,

There are wall-colored paint marks on my right Touch controller  because of this game.  Do I wish they had freeform movement to make it a bit easier to play with limited space?  Absolutely.  But if you have the room, the money, and are a raving mad fanatic (as I am and rave) then this is a must buy for Oculus.  Think of it as an overly long episode of the show starring you!

This game makes you the main character for 1 episode.  Bare bones done well.  I enjoyed the puzzles; they could make a very good game if they put in the effort.

But if you are a fan of the show and have already spent on a gaming computer and an Oculus the price of entry should not scare you away, this is a Rick and Morty episode that needs to be played through. There are the obligatory easter eggs and the gameplay is pretty standard fair as far as VR goes. But there are tons of new gags and jokes that had me laughing as hard as I do when watching the show.

If you are a serious fan of the series there is no reason not to buy this - even better if you can get it on sale.","Mar 16, 2018 at 11:03 PM",5, 5,

It has a reasonably strong if rambling narrative.  Of course if you're a fan of the show it's really cool being immersed in  an episode.

The only downside for me was the value.  It took me under 2 hours to get through, and once it was done I felt like it was... done.  There are some secrets and small digressions that I've read about, but it doesn't seem worth it to replay the scenarios just for those.  If you can get it on sale, then I say absolutely go for it.

It requires truely the largest space any game required so far for me, so don't bother getting it with a small space, you won't be able to play it not just well, but at all - for me I had to move to the edges of my place even though no other game with large area required so much. It's comparable to that first Oculus VR experience you get when you launch Oculus first time, with the floating robot head and the panels. Feels like an extended version of it with lesser graphics. The beginning was a little bit fun, but that's where the fun also ended. It's mostly a take-things-from-here-and-put-there game.

You can go and try completing quickly but miss most of the comedy, or take it slow and get to hear most of the comedy narrative in the game - it has so much narrative in it than any other game I've played. Comedy cartoon show, comedy narrative driven game along with solving some puzzles. Comedy was great. Replayability? It has some replayability after completion of game, but it doesn't excite me enough to go try it out. One play through, and a very long one at that, was enough! Need to play other games now! Also I would wait to get it on sale due to the lack of interest on my part of wanting to replay it. But as a comedy cartoon experience of one play through, give it a shot!

2022-05-28 13:04:09.227973,Mane_Vr,f'ing hate this game,ok so against my better judgement i bought this game mainly to show on my youtube page. i found it annoying as hell to play. if u have front facing setup this game is a waste of your money u can't turn to do some of the things u need to do which WILL cause you to rage out and the $30 cost is a joke. and while this might not bother most people the fact this is a teleport only game sucks the most for me. save ur money and skip this game,"Apr 27, 2017 at 12:07 AM",1, 7,

Finished the Story in about 70 mins. If your a huge fan like me then totally buy this! If not then wait for the price to drop. Price per length is a very subjective opinion and if you like the show as much as i do then I think you will be satisfyed.

Enjoyable, but short and I don't watch 'junk food for your mind' television... so I don't really know who these cussing cartoons are but it was still a playable game.

It's a fun 2-hour experience where you spend the majority of your time in Rick's garage. Lots of cool references to the show, but only gives you a small taste of what you should be getting for a $30 price tag. Roiland's voice acting was the best part... that and Troy.","Apr 26, 2017 at 2:09 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 13:04:18.705429,Radi5h,Nice VR game,"It's a nice game, pretty comfortable. You need to have a larger area to play in than just 1 square meter. I got a bit stuck when I had to stand on the satelite because I'm scared of heights but managed to complete the level with a mixture of taking the headset off and just blindly reaching through portals.
Not much of a game for the price ($30US) but I guess they have to cream it because there aren't many people in VR yet. The game seems more like a demo than a game, it's mostly set in the garage. If you have a lot of space to move around you could walk around the living room but there isn't much to interact with there.","Apr 25, 2017 at 6:44 PM",4, 2,

This game isn't perfect though. There's a lot of recycled material from job simulator. It actually feels like it should be titled ""Job Simulator: Rick and Morty edition"".
