2022-05-28 18:14:38.213706,Seltzersuds,sooo boring,almost fell asleep playing. took less than an hour to lose interest,"Jun 20, 2021 at 11:49 PM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 18:14:38.228666,Leonidas-I,Would be good if playable,"To start, this game is basically Lone Echo but while driving a space chair (like in the movie Gravity) with a broken joystick and an oxygen canister the size of a water bottle (Not to mention the broken saving system).  The graphics are incredible and the environments realistic, but the constant threat of running out of oxygen and difficulty of controls make it virtually impossible to enjoy these surroundings.  

Pros: 
-Great graphics
-Highly realistic (if frustrating) movement system.  
-Decent story
-Well-built environments

Cons: 
-Extremely difficult movement system
-Horrible resource management system, particularly pertaining to oxygen
-Unnecessarily complicated gameplay mechanics, such as rockets, shielding, boost, etc.
-Extremely limited resources
-Some unintuitive puzzles with no hints
-Lack of enjoyable Oculus Touch controller integration

In fairness, I haven't yet played the game on easy mode.  Perhaps this would solve all of my qualms with the game, but I rather doubt it.  Will update if my opinion on this changes.  
In short, a very good basis for a game ruined by nearly unplayable gameplay mechanics.","Jun 11, 2020 at 1:43 AM",2, 29,
2022-05-28 18:14:38.243626,Tectas,Realy intense but nice game,"First of, I'm not through yet, but I know I'm not far from it from what I've read, so I can already say, it's pretty short, but sweet.
Yes, the locomotion system is intense (Astronaut Difficulty with ""point to"" movement), but with the movement option I've chosen (which was the default at time of install) it only needs some getting used to with the oculus touch controllers and you're fine afterwards and pretty quickly good to go. Don't know how long this options is available though, because the others are definitley way harder to get used to, so I can understand the problems some people have with it.
At the moment I still can't think of a reason why someone would call it ""unplayable"" with touch controllers, it really is fine, it still can cause some nausea after some time, but it's really nice made and meant to feel ""realistic"" to some extend and delivers for my opinion.
Just check it out if you're into Zero-G, if you want something long and easy to digest at the same time, stay away from it, it's no lone echo, but it's fine in it's own right.","May 23, 2020 at 12:55 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 18:14:38.257588,TheRandomUser,Really good game!,"It is great fun to fly around in weightlessness. The controls are very difficult at the beginning (but also realistic), but you get used to it after a while. The environment is beautifully designed and has a high quality. The flying/floating is, I think, very realistic (I have never been in real weightlessness before, so I can't say for sure ;) ). So far I like the storyline very much. 
-
I would definitely recommend the game to others, but I would warn those who get sick quickly in VR to think twice.
-
The impressions were created in the most difficult level of difficulty and with a very good PC equipment, therefore on highest quality settings.
-
And to the ""Lone Echo is much better"" writers:I think that both games are very well done and both have their own individual character.","May 8, 2020 at 5:23 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:14:38.272548,T-di,Great With Xbox Controller,"After reading a bunch of negative reviews, I saw a review recommending using the Xbox controller instead of Touch. Great idea. Movement seems very intuitive with the controller. So far so good.","May 11, 2020 at 3:35 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:14:41.409159,azukaar,Not worth your time,"Your vision is extremly reduced to remove motion sickness, the trade off is you dont see anything and immersion is 0... might as well jump around in your living room pretending to be a cosmonaut","Apr 22, 2020 at 1:22 AM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 18:14:41.424119,Bangieboy,Buy Lone Echo instead,"Poor controls ruin this game from the start. Lone Echo shows how to do zero g immersively and intuatively, this game shows how not to do it.","Mar 19, 2020 at 6:36 AM",1, 8,
2022-05-28 18:14:41.440077,Turokhan,Cant Install,Eh.. another waste of time trying to install a game and windows blocking it,"May 8, 2020 at 5:50 AM",1, 1,
2022-05-28 18:14:41.455036,HighVisHarry,Un-intuative Locomotion.,"If youre looking for your next Lone Echo fix, you will not find it here.

Don't get me wrong, its not a 1 star game as some people have labeled it, but it is a poor implimentation of 0G movement, needlessly difficult to master.

I'm sure if I took the time to learn its movement mechanics more thoroghly, i'd have a great time, but time is valuable, and will that time spent learning be worth while? who knows.

Graphics, voice acting, and world building are all good. Just cant same much about gameplay, seeing as movement is a challenge in of itself.

An optimistic 3 stars from me.","Dec 15, 2019 at 9:44 PM",3, 28,

2022-05-28 18:14:44.565717,Cotivity,Spacing Out,"This game is INTENSE...I can't wait to get further into the experience but what I have played is a brilliant little puzzler.

Unlike what others have said, the controls are VERY intuitive...IF you use an Xbox controller! 

So in summary, play with a controller and bring a barf bag...GREAT FUN !","Jan 20, 2020 at 2:43 PM",4, 4,

Not for weak stomaches (especially CW/CCW rotating)! You were warned! Need to think a bit to complete mission. Do you wanna feel, what is free space movement in ZG about? Give it a try!

I have no idea what the game is about because i couldnt get pass the training at start. I dont think im gonna play this again. If i ever do ill update the review. PS thanks the devs for the support email, unfortunatelly it didnt help much with the nausea, especially when you strafe.  Althought i do saw the ""intense"" game warning i thought i could try it. Maybe this game just isnt for me.","Oct 30, 2017 at 10:18 PM",3, 10,
2022-05-28 18:14:47.753191,ccdeltabeta,I Think Lone Echo has a Cousin....,"The core mechanics of moving around are similiar to those of Lone Echo, and multiple control schemes gives you a wide range of movement capabilties (the VR scheme enables you to use hand motions to control your movement). It can be very easy to get disorientated, so be careful. I wish the controls were not fixed, and could be adjusted to suit your needs (i.e., I am left-handed). If you want to turn off the 'VR Blinders' to help manage motion sickness, reduce the 'Eagle Eye' setting. I have since gotten further into the game, and the feeling of being an astronaut is captured well. A polished experience that reminds me of a cross between Lone Echo and Adr1ft. Bravo!","Oct 31, 2017 at 2:02 PM",4, 23,

The level challenges were challenging and fun but not too difficult.  I finished everything only dying a handful of times.

Accidentally went outside of the Power Inverter building which updated the checkpoint with my oxygen at 20.  Impossible to continue because now I die within seconds of reloading last checkpoint.  Checkpoint system sucks.  You need to allow saves from anywhere.  Also the inverter room reloads incorrectly and is impossible to complete now.
