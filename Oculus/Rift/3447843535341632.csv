I have the hight scaling active and have a problem with that when I sit on the same position, go through a couple of waypoints and then return to the elevator, I'm not in the same place any more. A viewpoint reset using the oculus button can sort of fix it but not completely. Only a restart would reset it. Wondering how that got past testing.",Dec 3 at 10:34 PM,4, 9,
2022-05-28 20:18:06.315741,yaichy,Great game but have bugs,"It is a wonderful game, very funny and distressing.  The only issue I have that it has a bug that doesn't allow to collect all red harrys and finish the game. After you complete the east tower and come back to collect the rest of red harrys the bee on the reception does not accept the cookie no matter what you do.  The bee smoker is blocked and there is no way to unblock it.  Otherwise, I would give 5 stars.",Aug 2 at 12:18 AM,3, 4,
2022-05-28 20:18:06.330702,FireatWill1866,I really like the concept,"Floor Plan 2 is really fun and very enjoyable to play. The only thing i dont like is the fact that it is a roomscale type of game. The character might move out of the guardian some times and i have to restart the game. Rather than that i dont see anything else wrong with it. It's very challenging, but not to hard to make you go mad.","May 24, 2021 at 9:02 AM",5, 7,
