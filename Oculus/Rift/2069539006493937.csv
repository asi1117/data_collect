2022-05-28 18:13:20.727953,TheLonelyDeveloper,Not even worth 1 star,"Garbage even by BBC standards which are very low. Pure nonsense, totally uninspiring, not even interesting to play to a 5 years old. Total waste of time. Wonder how this crap gets funding.. I thought the Oculus store had higher standards regarding what gets published..",21 days ago,1, 1,
2022-05-28 18:13:20.743910,FM_HeatSink,Lame,"This was beyond a waste of time. You start in the Tardis and you never move. All you do is get the sonic screwdriver and point at a couple of things and that is it. Entire experience was 15 minutes of standing in one spot looks at the interior of, what? Prehistoric Tardis? Sorry but this was lame.",Feb 3 at 10:29 AM,1, 3,
2022-05-28 18:13:20.758870,animalsandmagic,An Enjoyable Experience,"Although I had a little trouble understanding what was being said at times, I really enjoyed the experience. As a Doctor Who fan it was an experience worth every moment I spent on it and as someone who has admittedly not yet met the 13th Doctor it made me want to get to know her better so now I'm looking forward to starting into those episodes. While I would have preferred my actions to actually mean something as that would have made it feel even more immersive, the way it was done made it an interactive, yet comfortable experience that allows it to be accessible to everyone. I felt zero motion sickness during this experience, loved the art style, and felt it was more than worth the price. I'm hopeful that there will be more of these experiences in the future as this is one of the best VR experiences I have had so far!",Sep 5 at 3:50 AM,5, 3,

2022-05-28 18:13:20.788790,Omarpixel,"Cute, short, experience. Want more.","I really liked this. Jodie Whittaker has done a very good job voice acting The Doctor here as well. I wish it was even a little teensy bit longer, like The Doctor showing you space outside the TARDIS for example. I feel like the team who worked on this should definitely write a longer story specifically made for VR. I'd buy that 100%.",Jul 9 at 2:48 PM,5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:13:23.905454,nightcat.mau,Outstanding!,"The 13th Doctor has to be one of my new faves. Think of Stever Irwin, only traveling through time and space. This was exciting, scary, and an absolute blast! And now I get why every new person drug along, well, I won't spoil your ride, but go for it!",Oct 25 at 9:06 AM,5, 0,

2022-05-28 18:13:27.113872,Sabrejet,Love this!,"Wish it was longer, I was playing it not knowing it was a you know, small story, and I was thoroughly enjoying it!  It had a lot of treats for people who always wanted any kind of Dr. Who game back in the day ;)  The animation is stellar.  The production is very good.  Edge of Time was fair (I liked it) but this makes a nice companion piece.","Jul 29, 2020 at 11:00 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 18:13:33.417014,demotricus,Great way to spend 15 minutes,"Cute little adventure, fun and interactive. I`m not really a fan of Jodie Whittakers portrayal of the doctor, (I stopped watching when they changed the character).

2022-05-28 18:13:36.552627,harrykimju,Go to stuff!!,"Wow, where did this appear from? Very very well polished experience from the BBC. Go to stuff when you've got your friends around and want to show them VR. Well done BBC (and Jodie W for participating, you made this soooo relatable).  Can't wait for the next thing you're cooking up BBC team, you're actually putting Britain on the VR map with this (despite ruddy Brexit!). Keep it up!
If you haven't tried this, just do, it's free and you wont regret the used disk space . Superb.","May 26, 2019 at 11:02 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:13:36.568584,itschriscollins,A great Doctor Who experience,"First off be aware this is a very short experience - probably about 15 minutes - but it is fun and immersive, and it's a great way to really feel a part of the Doctor Who universe.

There's something about the acting (Jodie Whittaker's voice and some Motion Capture magic) which is really engaging. It really feels like you are in an episode right there alongside the Doctor. I was very impressed by the way she followed you as you moved, although disappointed the game 'blacks out' if you move away from the centre spot.

The actual interaction is pretty slim with some basic movement with one hand - but boy did it feel good to get my hands on the sonic screwdriver! It was great getting a hands on closeup and worked well enough.

The graphics are simple but stylised and it just looks good. They haven't tried for realism, which was wise, and the end result is great. The story is fairly typical Who stuff, you either love it or you don't, but the experience surpasses that in my experience.

Given it's free, you really can't complain, and there's no point not having a go! I hope the BBC carry on making more VR content, and hopefully more about the Doctor.","May 26, 2019 at 2:22 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:13:36.583545,Sn34ky54murai,Amazing Story!,"When I saw this earlier today, I wasn't expecting much, but when I downloaded it and launched it, I regretted everything I thought before. The graphics are stunning, the voice acting is great. The alien was soo cute, and the modelling of the Tardis looked very nice and accurate. (Other than there were no custard creams if you know what I'm referencing here). Was sad it was quite short, but the ending really made me hyped for the next part of the story. Must get if you love Doctor Who! :)","May 17, 2019 at 5:17 AM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 18:13:49.208777,L2000B,Best way to meet my Doctor!,"So I recently saw this gem of a game and it was so captivating while watching... Everything about it was just breathtaking to experience!

The Doctor was as powerful as ever and Jodie Whittaker has really got the power when voicing her character like in the previous TV Series last year.

Volta is a really cute character, he has my up most support as me and the Doctor try to calm him down and it really shows how sad he is, obviously by his adorable emotions, about losing his parents.

The Tardis is beautiful when animated as whenever I look around, it looks stunning when detailed this nicely. And about the animation, it is decent but nicely done by the team at Passion Animation Studios, they really did a good job!

Even the music is beautiful to listen to! Like Series 11 of Doctor Who, Segun Akinola had composed such calm to epic music. It really captures the spirit of the environment of the game.

Overall this game, like I said, is a gem that I will never forget. It makes me feel like I'm actually part of the story and interacting with the Doctor! Even though it's short, it was written well and is truly a wonderful special 'virtual reality' episode that I will remember forever and always.","Jun 23, 2019 at 6:27 AM",5, 0,
