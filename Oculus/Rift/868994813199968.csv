2022-05-28 19:12:55.135717,price_kelley,OMG! LOL!    Shockingly Awful,"It took less than 2 minutes to install, 1 minute to exhaust the lifespan of the 3 different levels or stages within and then under 1 minute to get rid of it and wake up tommorow hopefully forgetting it exists in the Oculus library. Seriously - this is like witnessing some young devs first attempt at getting a game to work for the first time, everything is awful, the droning sound fx, poorly animated ""badies"", weapons, buggy behaviour, controlls, lifespan - EVERYTHING! ok, ok so its content, it does run but why on earth is this in the market as if its a finished project or game, its clearly not! when you can literaly poke your enemy to death with the end of your bow  - whats the point? 

If you considering installing dont bother youll get more thrills from picking your nose for 2 minutes instead.

Thats the review, go away now!",Sep 21 at 3:25 AM,1, 10,

In the archer minigame, you can actually walk over to one of the platfroms in the backround, and it's hilarious. You guys can probably add barriers to those bridges outside of the castle. There are a few bugs here and there, but nothing unbearable. Also, adding more games will make me like this game THAT much more, and also have me give it 5 stars!","Jul 19, 2019 at 6:47 AM",4, 8,

I'm fine with people using models from the unity store as long as the game is a fangame,  This is an original game with no relation to other games, so make your own models or make this a fangame of some sort.  Also there is almost no music in this game and only ambient music in the archery minigame, which is really unsettling and makes it feel like a horror game,  improve the graphics, use your own models, and add music and I might like this a bit more.","Mar 6, 2019 at 8:21 AM",1, 5,

If it wasn't for free, I would have rated this a 1 star.

The game definately shouldn't be on the store unless the developper is still working on the game, then no complaints. 

I would like to encourage the developper to continue. Experiment with some new ideas and try to make it fun.","Mar 17, 2018 at 4:18 AM",3, 7,

2022-05-28 19:13:14.130912,FastLawyer,"Don't listen to haters, free and alright","This game has 3 different mini-games.  First one is a barebones Space Pirate Trainer clone with no shield (well your shield is the lightsaber) and only 1 type of gun.  Flying drones come at you from 180 degrees in front.  Dodge and shoot or use light saber to block the bullets.  3 stars on this one.  The second mini-game is a goalie soccer game with giant foam hands to block the balls being shot at you from 3 cannons.  This game is actually pretty decent to go for the high score. 4 stars.  The last, but not least, is a bow shooting mini-game.  You basically use a bow to shoot enemies or strike them melee style with your bow that spawn from anywhere (360).  You can dodge bullets and teleport around.  The bow is very easy to shoot.  4 stars.  So all together, I give the game 4 stars, keep in mind it is meant for Steam and that's where all the leaderboards are kept and none for the Oculus version :D","Oct 7, 2017 at 12:17 PM",4, 6,

There are several other minigame apps available free on the Oculus store, but this one has a few unique ones like the Goalkeeper game where you block soccer balls from entering your net using extended arms, and the Drone Fight where you block lasers using a lightsaber. The minigame with the bow has been done with better controls on other apps, but you might as well check it out while you're there.

The shooting/lightsaber game is slightly better but still garbage, the AI is not even shooting at you.
The goalkeeper game is quite decent actually, it has a nice unique feature of giant hands, if this was the only game and it was a bit more polished it would have probably gotten 4 stars.

Also it will make you very sick, as the developer decided to teleport you with motion, probably the worst possible way to move in VR","Dec 16, 2016 at 5:30 AM",1, 4,
