2022-05-28 18:32:50.842830,byteframe,This was something else! Very special.,"I love the locomotion concept behind this. It's restricted and on a track and all that, but its very unique and is fun. You go up on a big track up onto the castle and stuff and you just keep going up and up and you get so high. This is very grand and I loved it. Bravo.",Sep 21 at 9:37 AM,5, 1,

I was dripping with sweat at the end of my 36.28 minute ascent up the tower. I lughted in a number of places. It was playing with a Link cable so I had to cable manage the whole way, so a Quest native version would be smarter.",Oct 7 at 2:32 AM,4, 0,

2022-05-28 18:32:54.060225,HisRoyalMajestyM,Epilepsy attack!!,"This looks like a REALLY good obstacle course game, unfotunately any time you want to switch directions not physically but with joystick, game switches to epilepsy inducing black & white flashing between game and track adjustments screen. It is JARRING to the point of not only being distracting but uncomfortable!! FIX IT! Why can't the view just adjust the way it looks in the game. Or give me options? (I didn't notice any, because I quit it was so frustrating)","Oct 12, 2019 at 7:46 AM",1, 6,
2022-05-28 18:32:54.076184,Atlas1021,Challenging and Fun,"I recived this game for free by the developer this morning and I played the adventure mode and it was amazing, the movement system has no motion sickness to it at all, the graphics are in a low poly style which is one of my favorite art styles in games, and the obsticles have a fair bit of challenge to them. If you like obsticle corses, then this is the game for you!","Dec 13, 2018 at 7:48 AM",5, 0,

thanks for your feedback. We will check this bug.

2022-05-28 18:32:57.196836,Signor_Issor,Sweat...,"This game made me sweat...even in winter. Turn left, hide, jump, sit down, stand up, move .... this game made a lot of fun. It seems pretty easy but it took a while for me to get the first level completed.","Mar 22, 2018 at 4:03 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:32:57.211796,Shaklton,Overall enjoyable,"This review has minor SPOILERS:

I had a fun time playing this game, and for the low asking price I felt that I easily got my money back. My fun was only interrupted when I got to (what I now know was) the final obstacle. I floated around on the conveyor belt maybe 6 times around the ship before finally giving up. After looking up a walkthrough of the game I found out that the swords that are supposed to spawn did not for me. Besides this somwhat major bug, knowing that I could have done that and finished the game right there I still walk away happy with my purchase. This reveiw is mostly for the eyes of the developers as to hopefully fix this bug before other people fall victim to it and give this game a bad rating.","Jan 3, 2018 at 11:36 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 18:32:57.225758,LegoKnockingShop,Fun to play cartoon violence,"Great fun VR title, well worth the money. Playable with a smaller room space but you'll need to keep moving yourself back to the centre. The GFX are basic but it works as a style and it's still plenty immersive, don't worry! My 11 year old loves this too.","Jan 8, 2018 at 7:45 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:32:57.240718,JadeKVR,A JadeKVR Review - VR YouTuber,"During the experience you move through a fairy-tale environment, towards the top of the tower, on a conveyor, encountering obstacles and traps, whilst simultaneously trying to avoid falling off the conveyor to your death. The gameplay involves avoiding these obstacles and traps, by leaning, ducking, dodging, to make it to the top of the tower. If you fail to do this you die, but are returned immediately back to the game, as you continue your journey to the top, and deaths simply affect your score. As you progress through the experience, you will also encounter more obstacles, those typically associated with a tower, such as canons and arrows. Height is a factor in this game as you travel throughout the game from a high vantage point, and some of the obstacles will require you to swing and hold on to rails to avoid falling. The music is ominous to reflect the gameplay, and the environment is well designed, as are the controls, leaving you will a fully immersive experience. A surprise awaits you at the top of the tower. Not for those afraid of heights, but would suit those looking to try an obstacle course or some different mechanics, in an immersive and unique environment. A fun game. *I plan to update thise review shortly as new features have been added since I played it.*","Feb 22, 2018 at 5:31 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:32:57.255679,FastLawyer,Fun obstacle course VR,"This game is quite the VR gem for $5.  I completed the obstacle course in 50 minutes after dying 99 times.  I was all sweaty by the end.  You really need a good sized room scale tracking for this game without any obstacles to dodge in your living room.  Also, your headset's cable will probably end up in tangles.  The graphics are simple and on the low end.  However, the game tracks extremely well even though you will have to re-orient your view constantly to maximize your view to pass the obstacles.  You will even have to basically put your head on the floor to get past some of these obstacles.  Look down at your shadow to make sure you're in the right spot.  Have fun and enjoy the awesome ending credit song for your reward :D","Aug 13, 2017 at 2:52 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:33:00.350401,Eulenauge66,A new idea,I must be honest: I didn´t play the game for too long. The graphics are just so absolutely basic that I can´t really enjoy it. All the time I had to think about how great it would be in a beautiful surrounding. But I give four stars nevertheless for the innovative concept.,"Sep 10, 2017 at 5:06 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:33:00.365361,short_mr_c,Amazing once the mechanics are mastered,"What an incredible game, especially for the asking price.  This game is a gem once you understand how to play it, but since the game can't track one's feet, it has come up with a pretty clever mechanic that is used instead.  Your head casts a constant shadow on the ground.  That shadow is basically your feet in the game.  That means that if you want to avoid an object coming up from the ground, you must move the shadow to avoid the object.  It's too bad that they don't state that in the introduction, as I would be willing to bet that mechanic is keeping some folks from enjoying this game as much as I am.  This is an extremely physical game, and as far as I can tell it is best played in room scale, even though it does accommodate front facing play.  If you do have room scale, though, then moving about is fantastic.  Dodging and stepping left and right, as well as swooping up and down the conveyor belt, all while ducking to avoid obstacles is wonderful fun.  Later in the game you'll need to grab onto pipes with your hands and jump from pipe to pipe, making you feel like a real-world Nathan Drake.  The forced timing and sense of danger in this game is also intense due to the nature of the conveyor belt.  I'm so glad I bought this game, and I think others will really enjoy it as well.","Aug 24, 2017 at 6:21 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:33:00.380321,markkane,Great use of VR,"The movement works surprisingly well and is very immersive. The world is pretty to look at and feels almsot like a character on its own. The various challenges engage you physically and feel very rewarding, especially when you master some of the more difficult segments. Despite having completed it several times I still enjoy going back and replaying the game. Looking forward to see more of this!
Disclaimer: I was a beta-tester for this game.","Aug 11, 2017 at 5:25 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:33:00.395281,pntmg,Immersive journey,"I love the coarse polygon based design of the game. The conveyor is a nice trick to travel large distances without having to walk in reality or simulate walking by pressing some button. Don't worry, you still got to move quite a lot. However, it’s the rails I like most since the start of beta testing. Once you see people grab a virtual rail and hold on to it with a dead serious attitude, you understand they are immersed for sure. 
One last comment: Although the ""running"" option is treated like cheating by the developers as it decreases your high score, it reminds me of speed runs and therefore, it is great by definition.","Aug 12, 2017 at 5:15 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:33:00.410241,Deeperbeige,"Interesting concept, mediocre execution","Challenging and unusual VR game about physically avoiding obstacles and traps as you ride a conveyer belt. The core is fun, but it's far too difficult to tell where your hurtbox is within the world. At one point there's a sawblade in the middle of the conveyer. Standing up so you go over it gets you killed. Stepping to the side makes you fall. Trying to squeeze between the blade and the edge is tricky to judge. This game contains literal difficulty spikes. Recommended if you like to try new concepts however.","Aug 20, 2017 at 3:29 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:33:03.491999,Gernth,"Great concept, beautifully executed.","The idea of avoiding obstacles as you move through the world on a conveyor belt is simple, but perfect for VR, where the normal limitations on traversal are a feature rather than a problem.    

The world is attractive but deadly, with a steadily increasing challenge leading to an unexpected and tough boss fight that is also quite the physical workout.

Overall, it's a brilliant small-scale game that deserves people's attention.","Aug 16, 2017 at 5:21 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:33:03.507956,MarquisDeSang,Brilliant idea but too soon.,"This game would require full body tracking : feet, hips, shoulders, head, hands. The floor is 1 feet higher, so when you lay down on the floor you float into the air. It's fun and really difficult. The lighting and modeling are perfect and you can see that it was made by real artists.","Aug 11, 2017 at 10:07 AM",3, 4,"Hi, thanks a lot for your feedback.

2022-05-28 18:33:03.523913,UBSERD,"Great game, jittering objects?",It's a gauntlet style game on a constantly moving belt and it's quite fun. But your hands and objects judder a bit taking you out of the experince overall. If updated to fix the issues it'll get 4 stars from me.,"Sep 3, 2017 at 2:07 AM",3, 0,"Hi UBSERD,
