2022-05-28 15:09:11.829205,Meshugggah,Fun Tennis Game,"The tennis feeling is really good! Some physics are a bit improvable or have to get used to but designer is very supportive. Also be sure to play around with the GRIP setting, for me it helped a LOT. In the grip setting the hand vs grip can be set to a variety of positions even 'off the racket grip' region. Also try to keep your tennis technique if you already play tennis (stand, swing etc) and not be tempted to play it like table tennis ;) Move those legs, too. Dont hit the ceiling :)",17 days ago,4, 1,Thanks
2022-05-28 15:09:11.845162,Robbenz,"On A Rainy Day, Beats Not Playing At All","I've enjoyed playing this game sporatically now in the past year and appreciate the updates impoving its performance.  I'm an avid doubles player and this simulates tennis play fairly well.  My one complaint at this point to the developer..give us a female avatar.  Ccome on now. its 2020 and WOMEN are in VR playing too.

UPDATE:  2/28/22
Changing my review from 4 to 5 stars because First Person Tennis is the BOMB!!  Mikori the developer has done a phenomenal job in improving the physics and game play in this app.  For IRL tennis players its great fun, exercise and competitive.  I'm loving this so much more now and working on improving my simulation game play skills which is significantly more difficult than the arcade style mode.  Most times no problem with multiplayer matches now and the discord app is readily available to discuss general topics, suggestions, bug fixes, and find a player.  I'm a long time Rift CV1 user and FPT is definitely my go to game now for exercise and fun and I'm also able to choose amongst several female avatars.  Get this if you want to play tennis that feels quite real, burn some calories, beat up on Stan Warwrinka and travel the world to win your first (and only) tournament.",Mar 1 at 1:05 PM,5, 7,

so awesome. I played in high school and now no one to play with, except the robot.  And he is best ever.

After 9 months, playing every day, I have been ranked #1 several times, but the difficulty level can be raised higher and higher by the user. 
I bought a Dell gaming computer and rift-s specifically to play this game, and it has been worth every penny. The developer is super, hats off to them. Thanks

I updated to version 3.3, and now it’s impossible to volley at the net. It was great before. 9/18/2021 The developer contacted me immediately and corrected the problem.

2022-05-28 15:09:15.053582,jsegurae,I don't like version 3.1,"1 month ago I bought the game and was very happy.
I would rate version 3.0 with 4-5 stars.
They have updated to version 3.1 and I don't like it at all. It is very slow and in my opinion less accurate.
The time to return it has passed.
Can I reinstall version 3.0?

UPDATE: I change the rating to 5 stars
The developer has contacted me and allowed me to install the previous version.
Now I'm enjoying myself again.
There will be people who prefer the new version, which may be more realistic, but it is not my case.
I appreciate the good after-sales service from Mikori Games and the quick resolution of this minor issue.

I can play Il2 w/o stutters, yet somehow this simple game - not.","Jun 24, 2021 at 10:39 PM",1, 4,How are you playing on Quest 2? Oculus link or wifi? please contact me at mikorigames@gmail.com
2022-05-28 15:09:18.159275,Ascertain,"Good game, but what happened recently..?","Great game and I previously reviewed. I have great fun playing this using Virtual Desktop on a Quest 2 wirelessly. However, between yesterday (4/8/2021) and today (4/9/2021) I am getting really strong haptics when the ball hits the racket and they last a long time after the ball has sailed over the net. In this, they are incredibly out of sync and my hand gets tired easily as the haptics were either not present or a lot shorter before. I need to stop playing it because the haptics are wrong and immersion breaking. Can you update and fix the haptics so they do not last the entire time the ball sails over the net? Haptics cannot be turned off natively in the Rift or Quest apps. Also.. controller battery life is a worry now.
UPDATE: increasing by one star after I discovered that Virtual Desktop Streamer update is what re-introduced haptics to my experience in the game. However, the programmed time for the haptics is too long as the buzzing is continuous from the time the ball hits the racket to nearly on the other side of the court. Perhaps haptic duration needs to be adjusted in the game itself?
FINAL UPDATE: Back to 5 stars! Interacting with developer on Virtual Desktop. In order to turn off haptics, have to put on headset, turn it on, take it off, go on your phone, turn on developer mode, then put headset back on and the option to turn haptics down to 0% will be there. No fault of game designer. This is a great game just activate developer mode and turn haptics to zilch and will no longer be immersion breaking. As an aside, again I am asking for the game designers to try and get this into the Quest store so we do not have to use link cable or wireless Virtual Desktop from PC. Shameful that Quest store does not have a decent native tennis game.","Apr 11, 2021 at 1:19 PM",5, 16,Thank you very much for this important feedback.

2022-05-28 15:09:21.343757,soysizzle,It’s getting there,"I’d love to be able to actually train with this and improve my real game, but the physics aren’t quite there like they are in eleven table tennis. (Using simulation mode)

Besides the physics, one thing which would be an amazing thing to have is hand tracking with your off hand, so I can use just one controller. It’s hard to do a two handed backhand with two controllers.

It’s got a lot of promise! If those two things were there i could see a lot of tennis players going out to buy an oculus. 

Keep on improving it developers! It’s close

Update: thanks for the serving tip! While that solved the one problem, now I have an issue where it only hits the ball about half the time. The rest the ball passes through like there is a hole in the racket. It’s better on slices than regular strokes, and better on the backhand side than the forehand. Any idea how to fix? It wasn’t happening in the beginning.","Mar 29, 2021 at 9:44 AM",4, 2,"Thank you! Join us on Discord, you can test beta updates with an improved physics.

There is no such thing as spin of any kind, serving is almost impossible, and the power mechanics are absolutely awful.

2022-05-28 15:09:24.483360,goodenchiladas,Absolutely love the game,"This game is my favorite and most played VR game by a mile. I recommend it to friends and family. And the recent physics changes in version 2.9 have made the game even more enjoyable.

I wish there was a different movement alternative to teleport and automatic run. Those 2 options work pretty well, but I feel like I the game is doing too much work for me. And I find all of the other manual thumbstick-based movement options too difficult. 

Some users have reasonably large VR play areas. Has there been any consideration of adding a free movement option, such as mapping a defined portion of the tennis half-court to the user's VR play area? Scaling a large VR play area to the width of the tennis court would make the user feel more in control of their success in the game. A VR player's ability side to side speed in their VR play area may be unrealistically fast compared to sideline to sideline speed in real life, but I can't help but think it could lead to an even better experience.

Thanks for all the improvements! Great game!","Sep 14, 2020 at 12:54 AM",5, 10,Thank you for your feedback and your suggestion. Unfortunately scaling the virtual court to the real play area doesn't work because your movement would be too much sensitive in game when you move your body during a shot.

So this is my second review. I wanna thank the developer for responding. It shows class. So I’ve much improved my VR game with the swing and timing....you really need to focus. As of you are actually playing. Still need a lot of practice but yes the timing and physics are spot on. So it’s a greet sim.

I used to hit the tennis ball to the wall alone to practice by myself.  If possible,  can I have a new training mode of wall tennis .  So I can practice my forehand and backhand in this wall tennis training mode. If possible.

First, thank you for this great VR tennis game.  I have this game since December  2019, enjoy playing it much , great purchase and great value game.

In the training mode , can I able to pick and play with different level of AI player.
Normal level,  advanced level, master level of AI player .  
So I can do training with different level of player to get better.

One issue with the tennis ball , it has only one Color and sometimes it is hard to see it coming on grass, blue green court surface.  Can it able to change different  color  if possible. 

Also can the game able to switch from day to night mode , to have raining or snowing will be fun and exciting gameplay .

Question how can I get more and better volley training to improve my volley with the AI  player .  A new volley training mode will be great if possible. 
Again, thank you for this game.  
I highly recommend this to everyone to play this VR tennis.

Please this games will be super fun to play with the Quest VR .. please","Jun 23, 2020 at 4:56 AM",4, 23,

The graphics are decent enough to make you feel like you’re playing tennis. I do the automatic movement And there’s no nausea from the camera moves it’s all well integrated.

The racket goes through the net as well. It is really annoying and did not happen in the previoius version.  Then it asks me for a new update and it says cannot load due to my kasperskys anti virus!  I cannot find the email/website of developer to report this too, so here is hoping Mikori games reads this and updates the game. WHICH Is fantastic by the way ! so reaslistic and a great work out!!

thankyou 

Finding games that I really like in VR has been tricky as a 60 year old male. I love In Death a superb game and played very little else till this little beauty was launched.  I use to play tennis very regularly when younger and this brings back memories. It is a great came, and I have played great nail bitting matches which has me screaming and shouting at times!  Hawk-eye is needed.  While perfectly playable in my study, a bigger room would be most useful as I keep hitting my ceiling light.  Now I have two great games to play.

Simulation mode is a bit tough for us noobs, but arcade is accommodating even if there is basically no shot variation - not tried that aspect in simulation yet.

The crowds are a bit inconsistent - they don't applaud or even animate half the time, but the visuals overall are decent and the level of opponent is pretty fair.

It is pretty immersive - you do feel like you're actually playing tennis and overall it's definitely a recommended experience.","Jul 21, 2020 at 10:53 PM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 15:09:34.021848,IIIZoNeRIII,Small issue with controller alignment,"I bought this game to be used as practice for my Mother, who plays tennis once a week. But she really can't because the alignment of the racket grip does not match the alignment of the Rift controller grip. With the head of the racket being misaligned to the controller it makes it difficult to practice real tennis. It would be great if the developers added a way to manually align the racket to our Rift controllers, like the re-alignment options in the games ""Contractors"" and ""Thrill of the Fight"" boxing.

Update - The good people at Mikori Games actually talked to me about my problem with the game and let me know they are going to work on a solution for the racket alignment issue with Oculus controllers. I do look forward to the update and I certainly appreciate this companies willingness to listen feedback from their customers.

There are almost way to customize or decide who to play. 

In training mode you can play against a computer or a ball machine. There is no way to adjust how the ball machine works and there is only one computer ai you can play against. There is also no way to customize how your racket works.

There is a story mode where you do face different ai and you can customize the strengths and weaknesses of your player, but it's unclear what any of the options mean and there is no way to choose who to play against 

The developer is not a good guy. Another review asked why you can't change how to hold the racket - an obvious feature that is included in competitors - and the developer just said f you, told the guy that he was stupid for even suggesting it, and left it at that

2022-05-28 15:09:37.185386,elafynoh,By far the best Tennis VR available,"I have been playing this game for months now on both Oculus and STEAM VR and it's the best Tennis VR available on the market. Once you get used to the movement, either autorun or manual and especially with the simulation mode activated it's highly addictive to play or even for training or home workout. The developer support is excellent and really passionate about improving the game even further. 

I am looking forward to a full integrated multiplayer system. The current multiplayer works in a basic mode, so you need to make manual appointments with other players outside of the game, which results in almost nobody being available if you just check available rooms. I think it would be perfect to have a full automatic server system included without the need to do manual appointments for gameplay. Something like Eleven Table Tennis would be great.

Anyway, even now it's 100% a recommendation for any tennis fan.","Jul 25, 2019 at 5:00 PM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 15:09:37.201344,Blissmode,"Could be great, needs work.","OK for practicing swinging motions but would not call this a tennis simulator. More like a tennis training tool at best. If this is intended to be a full simulator, this game is in early access.

PROS
-Great for practicing your serve motion. 
-No problems with tracking
-If you have a giant play area (talking like 16 square feet minimum), the movement could actually be very natural, being able to make wide swings and reach for the ball without fear of slicing a hole in the wall.

CONS
- You ABSOLUTELY NEED a giant play area to enjoy this game. This should be heavily disclaimed in the description and the comfort rating should be switched to intense. The automatic/alternative movement options are frankly all janky, are extremely hard to control, and break the entire experience. The auto/teleport always loves to place you too far or too close to the ball for a normal swinging arc and would sometimes just not work at all.
-The racquet size, court size and perspective are a little off (appear/feel way smaller than reality). I assume this was to make the game playable in average (smaller) play areas, but instead it just makes everything worse. Even if you do have a very large play space this will still be an issue.
- Moans. Why? This is silly. At least let users disable them. 
- UI needs cleaning up. Hard to navigate, buttons are not intuitive, really annoying menu music.
- Physics are good but still needs a ton of tweaking to before feeling anywhere near natural enough.
-Likely, because the controller is lighter than a racquet, you can home-run-golf-swing the ball and it can still land in play. A simulation should encourage the player to use natural tennis motions and speeds. Some could even opt to hold their real racquet or wear weights on the controller for full immersion.

The most enjoyment I got was using it to practice swinging motions, and especially serves. Sets of those motions over and over do build muscle memory and provide decent visual feedback.","May 21, 2019 at 1:53 PM",3, 8,"Thank you for your feedback. You need to calibrate the headset at the center of your space. You need a space enough to open your arms to play without problem. All sizes are as in real life (racket, court etc), you can test it. About moans, they are random and you cannot shut up your opponent in real life. The game supports the Vive tracker so you can play with your real racket. You can turn off the music. Please contact me at mikorigames@gmail.com if you have suggestions. Thanks"
2022-05-28 15:09:40.307038,Baglunch,Grip?,"I cannot play this game at all. Is there a way to adjust the grip? My racket appears to be at a very specific, locked angle to my arm, and so unless I'm looking at it I have no idea where the head of the racket is. If someone can show me how to fix this, I will definitely give this game more stars.","May 29, 2019 at 4:51 AM",1, 3,Change grip option has been added. Could you change your feedback?

2022-05-28 15:09:40.322994,SugarWill,I never write reviews...,Big advice: don't spend your money on this... worst tracking... nowhere near standing on an actual court... not sure why anyone is rating this positive...,"May 10, 2019 at 5:44 AM",1, 8,what problem do you have with tracking exactly? please contact me at mikorigames@gmail.com

2022-05-28 15:09:40.354909,lazyjones,Update?,"The new update has created some kind of physics problem with the game. I've never had an issue before the update, now, sometimes, in the middle of a match, my racquet will no longer be in my hand. It'll be floating up in the sky, and I can't get it to come back down! Had to start tournament over in order to continue. 
Fun game, but needs  little work still. Stupid things like, the ball boys and linesmen never move or signal. They are just statues in the way.","May 18, 2019 at 4:50 AM",4, 1,Please check your base stations. if the issue persist contact me at mikorigames@gmail.com
2022-05-28 15:09:40.369869,taquitobuddy,Doesn't suit VR well,"After spending some time with this game, I can't recommend it.  Part of it isn't the game's fault, as I think Tennis just isn't well-suited to VR, especially compared to the available Table Tennis games.  None of the motion options in this game work particularly well.  On top of that the AI is strange - inhumanely good in some ways, and then strangely lacking in others.  This could really benefit from having Multiplayer if done well.   All that said, if you are a big fan of real-life tennis, this still might be worth checking out.","Mar 20, 2019 at 2:26 AM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 15:09:43.488528,Davehaslanded,This is brilliant and a great workout,"First up, i'm terrible at tennis in the real world, But this came in arcade makes me feellike im really improving. Whether in translates to real world, guess we'll see. lol. Graphics are great. tracking is spot on and the auto teleport is perfect making you have to switch up between forehand and backhand shots. What i do hope is that they add a VR player vs Controllerplayer on the same system mode as that would be great, especially when friends are round.","Mar 10, 2019 at 2:46 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:09:43.504485,mindcola,Feels like tennis!,"PROS:
I used to play a ton of tennis and, due to foot injury, can't really zoom around the court anymore.  This game satisfies my need to strike the ball and get my ""tennis on"".  You can play baseline and aim the ball almost as in real life.  The direction of your stroke will dictate the type of spin you put on it.  Hit a thumbstick and you have rushed the net where you can put away volleys and hit overheads.  It's all quite realistic and plays smoothly.

CONS:
The AI could use a little tweaking to add some surprises to a rally.  For example, have the AI hit a drop shot now and then which forces you to rush the net.  Sometimes, the AI will be curiously unable to return a shot - just standing there in a forehand pose while the ball passes by.  Happens rarely, but kind of odd.

OVERVIEW:
It's good fun and allows you to progress by playing various tournaments and increasing your ranking.  I enjoy the game and hope that the developer continues enhancing it!","Dec 30, 2018 at 4:04 AM",4, 20,

The moment of making contact with the Ball feels wrong too, expecially on the Forehand combined with the static Player placement it feels like you need to learn the Game and not use ur Real Life Experiences. A Freind of mine playing Tennis for many years has been feed up playing the game after 10 min. His Comment  "" It just feels wrong.""  Won´t refund it because it works, but it just doesnt feel right.","Jan 22, 2019 at 5:50 AM",2, 3,Have you played in Arcade or Simulation mode? Keep in mind that the weight of the controller and the weight of a real racket are different. Try to swing a bit slowly.
