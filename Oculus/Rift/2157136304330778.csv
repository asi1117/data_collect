2022-05-28 18:48:17.744211,bruh_moment101,Worst experience yet,I decided to give the game a shot since it was about planes and stuff even though the reviews were not that bad biggest mistake ever. First off the controls are horrible every time i try moving the stick to the right or left my arm is spread in a 90 degree angle  and some times i have to physically turn and then the up and down are even harder to move. Second off when im in the air 70% of the time i end up far away from my plane and countless times it caused me to die. Third off if I try flying up above the mountain in freeplay the frames start loading horribly. Overall this game does not even deserve a single star never expected it to be such a horrible experience it has huge potential so i hope in the future they can fix it. As of right now though I would not recommend anyone to buy it.,"Jun 19, 2021 at 12:08 PM",1, 1,

When you play the game, please remember that the controls are based on holding a flight stick with a pivot point in the middle.

2022-05-28 18:48:20.916725,ethan.hardley.1728,Complete trash.,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The mechanics of this game are completely terrible. You have to look directly at the control stick while using your hands to turn but even still, pulling back to fly upwards is incredibly buggy and its a 50/50 chance whether it will work as expected or whether you plummet to the ground. Another problem is when looking at the stick, YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY SEE WHERE YOU ARE GOING.  In a flying game the least I expect to do is be able to fly but somehow, the developers failed to meet that expectation. If I could rate this game 0/5 I would, but the minimum is 1/5 so here we are. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.","Aug 5, 2020 at 11:44 PM",1, 43,

Needs alot of work on the dynamics after launch, start up was cool but keep working on the details. Dog fight is a joke.

2022-05-28 18:48:20.948641,VCRRepairman,Pretty fun but no simulator,"This is definitely an indie flight game but it has a lot of charm and the elements of a great game.  The first thing I think that should be cleared up is that this is not a flight simulator.  This is similar to a game like Ultrawings where it is accessible but has just enough of a learning curve that you feel you are flying with some skill.  

The campaign is short and there are some seriously bad game design decisions.  The two instances that come to my mind are 
1. There is a scenario where you can choose to land on an aircraft carrier or island.  If you choose to land on the island - I believe it is impossible to do.  Another reviewer said this as well.

2. Dog fighting with machine guns seems just inefficient and boils down to luck. I feel like the enemy AI's intelligence is just fly at your plane and hope to clip it.  It doesn't feel that intense.

What this game will give you is about an hour of fun and simple flight mechanics.  It's very arcadey and isn't as realistic as VTOL and no where as realistic as DCS but I like that personally.  I can easily fly my jet within a few minutes of practicing and some of the campaign missions are really fun.  

For the most part you seem to fly in the same region over and over and areas are not very diverse.  The mission objectives do change and some are challenging and feel like they boil down to luck but at least they're an attempt to change things up.  Landing on the carriers is pretty easy but still feels rewarding every time.

My advice to the developer is:

1. Improve the dogfighting mechanics and have more bombing missions!
2. The calibration screen is awful.  Get rid of it.  I would have to get up, stand in the blue area, and then sit back down and click the right joystick to calibrate back in my seat.  I get that you do it so you have room to hit the switches but it's not necessary and no other flight game that I've played does this.","Jan 17, 2020 at 10:04 PM",4, 36,Thanks for the comments

I feel like I had gotten all the fun out of the game within 30 minutes of playing. The demo was great, but the full game definitely isn't worth $20 -- maybe closer to $5 with the experience as it stands.

As a private pilot and one who has spent most of my life working in and around aviation there are a couple of things I'd like to see near term. 1) A ball landing system to help define the glide slope as on real carriers, and 2) An airspeed indicator to help stay on the glide slope. And, lastly, an altimeter wouldn't hurt either. Keep up the great work, please!!

2022-05-28 18:48:33.647675,Prometery,Feeling like a fighter pilot,"This is what I wanted the real-life fighter pilot game to be! A real cockpit with switches in correct positions, a realistically looking air carrier ship, etc. That's said, if you're looking for a fun air combat game, you should probably look elsewere. Each mission is short, and includes takeoff and landing procedure, just like a real NAVY pilot would have. This game is a simulator first and foremost, and this is what I'm giving my 5 stars for. 

I wish there would be more explanation/requirement on how to use hook and landing gear, as now it feels optional: you can complete the tutorial and all missions without ever having to flip those swithes. I suspect, the developers are working on incoprorating those in their weekly updates (Yes, WEEKLY! This is unheard of in game development, such fast turn around and continuous releases. Way to go, devs!), so the game would become even more realistic.","Mar 3, 2019 at 3:20 PM",5, 18,"Thank you for the comments.  In the new Landing Mode you're forced to lower the landing gear, which also lowers the hook.  We decided to group the hook with the landing gear lever to make it more simple, but we can re-think this if the majority of our users feel otherwise.

Great sense of flying and the water graphics are top notch! I'm about a quarter of the way through the campaign mode.  Having a lot of fun with the landing sessions as well.

2022-05-28 18:48:36.784286,Anomalous2141,A Challenging Flight Sim w/ Room to Grow,"I try to grip the joystick and the joystick goes flying off in all directions.  It's completely uncontrollable.  I will be requesting a refund and might try again once the glitch has been repaired.

UPDATE:
So it appears as though there is no glitch and the game designers insist on using some hand motion rather than moving the whole arm.  Perhaps this is faster, perhaps it takes some getting used to.  Certainly the learning curve is what makes VR so appealing overall, though I still don't understand why, when we have a perfectly functional thumbstick on the controller, we have to use some digital stick in the game with no natural center of return or resistence.  I doubt real fighter pilots have to contend with that.  Still, that being said, it does seem to deliver on its promise of putting you in a fighter pilot seat, though I still think $20 is a bit much for it.  Best of luck developing this, hope it works out for you guys, and also take a look at the volumetric clouds.  They don't seem to be working.","Mar 24, 2019 at 9:46 AM",3, 1,"There isn't a glitch, you're not using the control correctly.  
The flight stick control is based on your wrist position, not your arm.

2022-05-28 18:48:36.800243,Atoner,So far so brilliant,"Please, however, get rid of that instructor/mission adviser.  When I am being talked at by my training officer I need to be yelled at - like the drill seargent in Full Metal Jacket - not like Tom Skerrit with a warbling case of the ""sorrys.""  Seriously, his voice alone is such an immersion buster I burst out laughing so hard it was ten minutes before I could continue, and I had to change my underwear.
I'm sure you're developing this as fast as you can, but have you ever considered adding extra control, like pitch and turning without banking to the joysticks?
It works intuitively in Ultrawings, and I think I could benefit from it here too.
That's just a personal lazy one for me as I like to sit back in my couch and not have to move too much.
Other than that I absolutely love the experience so far: being able to look back over your shoulder to see where the target went and knowing my hands are being tracked without me having to see them brings such an incredible sense of freedom. 
Great fun!
Edit: After a few more hours with this I am getting the subtlety of wrist flexes and nuance much more - still it would be nice to have an option of using thumbsticks.   Still hate that instructer's stupid voice - hammer that ""B"" button to Skip- Thank You for that option dev.    Yerp?","Mar 28, 2019 at 7:57 AM",4, 2,"Noted, thanks for the comments."

Longer missions with some harder missions or expand the free flight with more to do. Grasping and using the switches is very buggy, I love the dramatic shadows in the cockpit as well as the real look about it. Also doing a loop and barrow roll left me breathless in VR. An altimeter would be nice as well as being able to increase the details without getting drop outs and freezes.

2022-05-28 18:48:46.237003,Tietken1980,Not as high quality as I thought it was.,"Saw all those 5 star reviews and I really thought the game was of high quality. For example, the character in the hanger didn't have shadows and when he talks his lips doesn't move, only his jaw.
As for the control of the plane, it was annoying since I could only use the movements of my wrists and it was too sensitive. If I looked back to the behind of the plane, the sensitivity of the control nearly makes the plane crash cause all it takes are small movements of the wrist. The control mechanism of the game needs a rework before it can be a satisfactory experience with how it is controlled.
I wouldn't say it's a ""must have"" game but a recommended game for plane/jet enthusiasts.
I didn't get nausiated but at times felt like I was falling, similar feeling to roller coaster rides.","Jan 25, 2019 at 11:48 PM",3, 2,"Thanks for the comments, we limited shadows in the hangar because Oculus requires a 90fps minimum on low end systems.  Controls are being improved further in updates next week, along with new gameplay modes."

Now seriously, there's no need to go back to the hangar every time. Take off could just be part 1, then part 2 is flying through the waypoints, part 3 is weapons training. It's all one mission. Making it impossible to skip through the dude talking in the hangar is pretty frustrating.

I encountered a bug on mission 3. I couldn't take off. I activated everything, pushed throttle full forward, and turned off the brake and nothing happened. Restarted the aircraft multiple times and still nothing. Will be fun when all the kinks are worked out. It has a lot of potential.","Feb 3, 2019 at 3:09 AM",4, 3,"Thank you for the feedback.

Great fun and as close to realistic as I'll ever get. Much respect to the real pilots that land on Aircraft Carriers. It might just be VR, but my stomach tightened up when approuching the runway.

^This is a video of my first experiences with the game.

I enjoyed the game a lot. However, I played it to mess around. I didn't play it as a super serious simulator.

The only thing 'negative' thing about the game, is that it's very easy to get motion sickness while playing. I dont normally get motion sickness, but I had to stop a few times whilst playing.","Jan 17, 2019 at 12:37 AM",5, 7,

My Thoughts:
This is my 2nd Impressions video of this game after I had a really bad experience on my 1st playthrough. There was a bug in the game that removed all 3D effects and I felt like I was playing the game in 2D.
Thankfully the developers have fixed the issue and the game now looks 3D in VR.
The handling of the jet was very good but I found the rest to be a mediocre flight simulation. I know it's based on an aircraft carrier but the game feels a little bland and basic.
I have played a lot better, and more substantial flight simulators in the past.
The developers have said they will be adding new missions and scenarios all the time and for 1st timers into VR you'll probably really enjoy this as it's a good introduction into flying in VR. 
For VR vets like myself who have had experiences with other flight simulations you might find this game a little too basic and lacklustre.","Jan 15, 2019 at 3:44 AM",3, 15,
2022-05-28 18:48:49.413507,SteveHammleMan,I like it!,"I found myself looking around the cockpit for 5 minutes staring at the various switches, dials, and buttons.  Very high resolution and great looking.  If you get motion sick easily this might not be for you.  Otherwise its a must have for the VR library!

Easy to pick up and play but fun enough to keep coming back for more. 
Note: Devs can you please fix the third campaign mission, landing at the airport doesn't seem possible.","May 1, 2019 at 6:28 AM",5, 1,

You have to grab it and twist your hand left/right/up/down. You dont move your arm. The reason its moving left on you is because your wrist is rotated left when you grab the flight stick.

Some of these reviews are ridiculous, this isn't a $60 game.
The cut scenes aren't perfect, there's some camera clipping and the shadows are off in spots, but that really doesn't effect the game.  The experience is top notch.  You really feel like you're in the cockpit of a jet.  The sense of speed feels a little off, but otherwise its well worth the price of admission.

Not the most realistic game ever but the story elements make it unique and fun.  The cockpit looks great.  I spent 10 minutes just looking at all the dials and gauges.  

I have ultrawings and this is a mix between an ultrawings type game and a true flight simulator.
