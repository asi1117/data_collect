An interesting game where you utilize visual tracking to shoot down hordes of enemies in the virtual world! What's cool about this game is you hold down the action button (""A"" on the right controller) and the lasers will fire steady as long as you hold the button. Head tracking is precise and neat, and there are scores of enemies and quite a few bosses as well, like a killer dragon, and others I won't spoil....

One thing about the game, however, is it takes a LONG time to really get difficult. Things didn't really start heating up until about level 72, and by then I was letting damage happen just to make things a little more challening. Of course, when two INSANE bosses came out around level 97 or 98 (I forget which), I wished I hadn't!

One thing that really put a damper on this was when I ""died"" and the game ended, the headset went completely BLACK, and I couldn't see ANYTHING, although the music was still playing. However, I did run the game on the PC monitor in full screen; I wonder if that had anything to do with it?

There are two ways to play this game: One, is look at the target and hold your gaze there while the laser burns your enemy, which basically means you are turning your head constantly. The other way is to rotate the thumb stick, I believe on the left controller, which will turn 90 degrees at a time. Naturally, I preferred the turning the head method (a survival tip is to keep the majority of your gaze limited to front, left and right, while limiting the back for when you hear ""sounds."") 

The other problem, which was really kinda slight, was when the robots who charged me ended up on top of me, it was difficult to see where they were. Still, it was quite a fun game, but seemed to take so long to really get challenging! I HIGHLY recommend the developers add a difficulty level to it so people who want an insane challenge can just go!","Jan 12, 2019 at 8:44 AM",3, 1,
