bad voice acting, annoying inventory. trying to get something and the belt just bounces around like a  5 year old with way too much sugar in their system. enemies never stop spawning and no way to turn your character using touch controlls. so if one of your sensors isnt working att that well.. well your screwed. 
free would be too expensive for this","Nov 4, 2018 at 8:11 PM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 19:47:37.140577,Javelin396,needs more movement options,"as someone who enjoys smooth locomotion i found this to be painfully slow, and its exacerbated by having controller oriented movement, because when you reach behind your back to grab a clip to reload, your also probably gonna take a few steps backward.  the gameplay itself isnt bad, but after a few hours of playing the game i kept having bugs occur where i would fall through the world and end up having to keep restartin one of the levels and just stopped playing cuz it was getting annoying (it was the cliff area just after you get the bow). i saw alot of potential for this one but i dont think im gonna come back to it due to the issue ive been having unless theres some sort of update","Sep 10, 2017 at 5:06 AM",2, 7,
2022-05-28 19:47:37.155537,starpilot149,Really solid game,"Despite being an early access gallery app, this game is polished in all the areas that actually matter for VR. Weapon mechanics (holstering, reloading, aiming, recoil, handling, grenades, bow&arrow etc) are all without problems and very satisfying to use. Free movement is allowed, although rotation must be done at 45 degree increments. You'll notice that compared to other gallery apps, an unusual amount of thought and effort has been put into making this game. For instance, to restore health, you grab a ""stimpack"" syringe off your belt and actually inject it into your left wrist. You can shoot fireballs with your right hand. And the weapon design along with the enviroments and combat pacing very often make you feel like a soldier in XCOM. Don't worry about the plot, or the fact that all english text seems to have been run through google-translate. Just enjoy fighting mutants and space pirates with guns and magic under a majestic cosmic backdrop.","Sep 5, 2017 at 2:35 AM",5, 12,
