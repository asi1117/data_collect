2022-05-28 19:30:41.345019,Soundlufs,Expectations not met,"The descriptions of the Project M suggest a high quality work, with lots of attention put into details, to make the game character as alive as possible,  but unfortunately there is a big room for improvement.
The better scenes are literally rushed through, especially the sea shore, and the ending, and the dialog suffer from puppet body animations, with hands that sometimes collide with, and go through her own body?  I do not recall any game character suffer from that...
There were some positive moments, the jump, the the sea, and the ending looked promising, but alas,  those were short glimps, whether the overall experience felt uninspiring.
Bottom line, there is a potential, and getting this introduction during the sale, it was almost ok for the money, but not as groundbreaking as suggested.","Jan 13, 2019 at 10:49 PM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 19:30:41.359978,starfox104,Too Short For A Beautiful Game,"I liked the graphics and environment and disliked the non-user free movement and most important: too short!!! All well done is around 20m game. 
That's a shame because this project it has legs to walk but if you are a anime/otaku/japanese fan go ahead but see first the video.","Jan 14, 2019 at 5:52 AM",2, 2,

2022-05-28 19:30:44.477186,tonyfromsyracuse,WOW...just WOW,"THIS...is what VR is all about. WONDERFUL job developers!!  it was a rainy,dark miserable night here. I bought this little VR show off and was BLOWN AWAY.  I stepped from a dreary night...into a beautiful sunny neighborhood where I was greeted at the door by a cute and fun beautiful girl who spent time with me...seemed interested in me and showered me with attention. it was fun..cute..and in a couple scenes kinda hot.
THIS IS VR. this type of thing could be a whole sub genre of VR. where you can pick a girl from a list and spend time with her at her place and other places like restaurants or quiet bar and interact. you have no idea how much fun this was. you developers are genuises. the only thing missing? free roam. we should be free to walk around in the house to truly make it interactive. and more ambience...such as maybe birds and people walking by outside,cars driving by. but anyways....I want more of this type of thing. I want to be able to jump into a realistic world and spend time with these beautiful VR babes. someday...they will make them respond to voice commands and do what you want them to do. such as that scene with her in the dress and bikini? if you could tell her to do sexy things...EVERY guy who does VR would want this. I would gladly sacrafice shoot em up VR games for things like this. WONDERFUL JOB. this should be mandatory viewing for people who are into VR. MORE PLEASE! with different women and different enviroments. maybe shopping in a mall store...sitting with a girl at an elegant romantic bar with candlelight etc etc. but please more like this and allow us to have her pose as we like!!!!!!!","Nov 10, 2017 at 1:03 PM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 19:30:44.492146,jie.cui.7503,Like this kind game,The character is very perfect. It's actually a 10 minutes movie insteal of a game. But very worth to try it. there're rough 4 parts. 1) jump from the plan 2) With bikini on the beach 3)talking 4) The girl show her new dress at finally sit on your leg.   It's very very beautiful. Both the scene and the girl. I really love it.,"Nov 4, 2017 at 8:23 AM",5, 15,
