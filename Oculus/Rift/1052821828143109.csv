I bought both the Steam version [outdated but allows addon levels] and the Oculus store version. Had no issues up until I found out the Oculus version got an update that added new maps and features. Why would that be an issue? Well they locked it to the Quest headsets only. If your like myself or many others who own a Rift S, your S.O.L. saddly. I'd love to give it the five stars this game deserves but locking content to specfic headsets is a hard middle finger to the players in my eyes. Until they unlock content for all headsets, I'm sticking to my two stars and staying on Steam with my custom maps.",Aug 2 at 7:45 PM,2, 35,

2022-05-28 12:57:18.128565,DisneyPirates,QUEST FEATURES NOT ON RIFT S,"Absolutely amazing game but its extremely unfair that quest users can get more locations, paint on multiple walls, be able to customize there character and have stencils as well as other features. I feel like what ever headset you have, people should have the same experience no matter what. It seems weird to have the same game on two different headsets with different features. I feel like a lot of games are trying to only be on quest or have more features on quest and rift s users like myself get the short end of the stick and some people can't afford both headsets or some rift s games aren't supported or can't transfer over to the quest. So I would really appreciate not just me but all rift s users if you add quest features onto the rift s version of the game. Other than that it is a really good game. Keep up the great work!","Jun 20, 2021 at 10:21 AM",4, 101,

2022-05-28 12:57:18.172447,ImZalgo,its a nice experience,"The game feels good to work with,  i prefer to do art instead of graffiti, the quick selection of colours, settings and music choices is great.
However there is a few problems:
1 - there is nothing to use as a stencil to block the spray
2 - i can only paint on 1 wall and very limited on where you can be in the world
-  -  i understand why this would be the case but it throws the immersion away 
3 -  i always see the color palatte (left hand) popping up, this should be activated by a button instead or be less sensitive 
4 -  coming back to point 2,   okay we can paint on 1 wall,  but why then cant i export my image to share or edit elsewhere ?

i mainly dropped a star because of point 4.  other art/model apps ive used allow this, so i can do 3d modeling or picture editing in another app","Jun 19, 2021 at 10:23 AM",4, 11,

2022-05-28 12:57:21.308204,Nostalgicz,Beyond expectations,"This is easily the main game I use in VR. Down from seeing details of paint wet/dry and down to pressure sensitivity of cans. 

I have spent hours upon hours with the boombox playing music and having the option to come up with my own design or using the projector.

Only things that could definitely be added is:
- The update to use stencils
- Sometimes the items used to reach higher spots can glitch out and disappear completely. So having an app created to allow us to bring different items in to either replace or allow personal preference.
- Creating an Application for android and iPhone which allows us to access our artwork without having to dive into folders.

Overall, definitely my favourite VR game.","Nov 14, 2020 at 9:13 AM",5, 34,
2022-05-28 12:57:21.323163,SvntiagoProdigy,ATTENTION DEVELOPERS,"So this game is fantastic, I love every bit of this game especially as a graffiti artist. It is much cheaper than buying tons of cans and caps and doing it in real life. I recently just purchased the Oculus Quest 2, and so I went ahead and bought the quest version of the game which I have found to be much better in terms of graphics and UI. The only DOWNSIDE to that is that the quest version does not have a redo button!!!! Why would you guys not put a REDO BUTTON???? I would give this game 5 stars, but I just can't without having my beloved redo button. There is one implemented in the PCVR version but not the quest. You guys seriously need to update this because that is such an essential tool in this game. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE put a redo button in the quest version. I will rewrite my review once this has happened. Everything else is perfect.","Oct 16, 2020 at 10:28 PM",1, 47,
2022-05-28 12:57:21.339121,Red_Go,I'm getting it and it's soooo cool!,"I just bought it for my 10 years old daughter who loves painting.  But it turned out it was too hard for her.  So instead, I gave it a try and spend a few hours then...  it's freaking cool and so much fun!  When I first saw this game, I assumed it was for just professional artists, so I didn't buy since I had no experience on any kind of drawing or painting.  But after a few days of practice and a lot of searching on youtube, I became kind of obsessed to this spray thing.  It feels so real than any VR games I've done so far, the satisfaction after finishing a paint is nothing to compare to playing just a VR game.  I finally see VR is not just about games.  

If you think you might liked drawing, painting but never had a chance to do it for real, this is your chance to find out your potential.  Maybe you are not a great artist but it could be a wonderful hobby.","Dec 7, 2020 at 8:03 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 12:57:24.452907,heyimkass,Fun but needs more updates!,"UPDATE AS OF JAN 2022: The devs have left this version of the game in limbo. The Quest version has been updated with new locations and features but sadly the Rift S version of the game has been left in the dust. Very sad to see.

------------

First of all let me just say WOW this game is a lot of fun! 10/10 must buy.

I do have a few suggestions and requests.

- add a paint stick so that we can easily fill up hard to reach areas (without needing to climb on things.

- add stencils and masks . Ex a card board that i can hold for straight lines and a paint lid for circles. And maybe add a way to add tape to cover/mask out an area that I dont want to paint.

-add more environments. The current environments are fun but theres only 4 small areas and the rest are studio areas with a single wall in an empty room.
 
- add more life to the environment. A few of the areas have birds but please add either Ai walking around or doing their own graffiti in the bg (even of they’re just tracing over the same thing )",Jan 7 at 8:49 AM,3, 13,
2022-05-28 12:57:24.468864,HAM_SANDW1CH0699,really happy,I just got the game and its really good,"Dec 16, 2020 at 6:31 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 12:57:24.484822,AverageNick484,Great game needs more freedom,"So ill start of by listing the pros and cons before writing an indepth review.

-Pros
Beautiful Graphics
Amazing Physics
Easy interface
Great Music too listen too
Fantastic Enviornments 
Tons of color options

-Cons
No players online 
Very limiting where you can paint
No Joystick Locomotion (Only teleportation)
Objects cant be painted or used as stencils or shapes

So to start off the graphics are very nice, but nothing to write home about. The enviornments and locations you can tag are great you can visit a roof, tag a subway, sneak in a train yard, and more. The physics of the spray paint are AMAZING, the wet paint, drips, how the paint drys, and how it sprays are on point, not to mention the customization you can do with the nozzle of your can and the WIDE variety of colors. The saving sytem is really good and very innovative. 

My main gripe is that in each location theres only one wall you can paint! Theres so many ideas I had but couldnt put to use do to the limitation of the enviornment. For example in the subway I wanted to go in the train and tag the inside but you cant, same goes for all the other locations, there are plenty of other things to paint but you just arnt allowed. I wish the game also integrated a type of stencil use with the interactable objects in the game. I wanted to use a wooden plank to make a straight line but the paint goes right through it and doesnt even paint the plank itself! Another thing that takes you out of the experience is you can only teleport. I find myself moving alot in the game, and with a limited space its hard to move effeciently, having a walking locomotion would be much better. Take the control button out and put it in the phone and make the phone the control button so the left stick could be used for that. The last thing i want to talk about is the multiplayer option, i find myself wanting to play with people on the multiplayer but NO ONES ON!

Final thoughts: The game is absolutely WONDERFUL! GET IT!","Aug 8, 2020 at 6:12 AM",4, 28,

2022-05-28 12:57:24.515739,RYONIX,Stencil like update?,"This is has great graphics and I can keep myself entertained. 

I havnt tried it yet but I was thinking it would be cool if I could pick up an object and put it against the wall and spray over it using it like a stencil. The paint doesnt even have to interact with the object only the wall. For example I could pick up one of those boards and use it to paint a straight edge. Theres all sorts of garbage stuff you have for us to interact with already. That would be a cool update.  All in all its a good game","Mar 12, 2020 at 11:49 PM",5, 62,

Painting feels very realistic, though I wish paint density changed with direction, meaning angling the can actually changed which end of the spray is a solid line and which end is flared.

He recommends turning off tesselation on your video card to improve performance.  Your best bet, though, is to upgrade your video card to oculus' recommended spec: gtx970.  

Kingspray was developed according to Oculus' original min spec which called for a gtx970 and that is still what they recommend.  They updated their min spec a while ago to include the gtx960 but that involves using their asynchronous space-warp technology, which sounds pretty dodgy.  Here's a link to a document about their min and recommended specs: https://www.oculus.com/blog/updating-rifts-minimum-and-recommended-spec-os-to-windows-10/?locale=en_US .  Your cpu is fine.  It'll be the gtx960 that's causing the low frame rate.  We don't have any reduced graphics settings as we are trying to make Kingspray feel as realistic as possible."

More flexibility with undo (I know, you can't undo in real life anyway) and being able to save/share replays even over multiple sessions would be cool. The movement system is ok, but you rarely end up *exactly* where you want, it gets close though. Being able to start a spray with the can already tilted/pointed/oriented at the correct angle to the wall would be useful too, rather than starting a spray then turning it out to get a fade. More and/or custom locations would be great too. Or to be able to work on a wall in an empty space, then put your work on a wall in a scene. ******* As it is though, it's a great game/experience. It's fun to spray paint and mess around, especially since you're not breaking the law.

Yesterday I decided to, and began working on it. Today I jumped back in that saved game, and the reference image had to be reloaded and, painstakingly re-placed on the wall. Discovering the aspect, FOV, and exact placement in the world is nearly impossible, so i would literally have to complete the project in one sitting. Unreasonable.

So, i'm just hoping at some point a patch is released to save the position of the reference in the world, the FOV, aspect. Even better would be to turn the FOV and aspect into numbers instead of a slider so the artist can write it down and type it in the next play. Then re-placing it in the world wouldn't be so bad (or impossible as I'm finding it).

2022-05-28 12:58:02.443272,neuro27,For Artists; Great Social Experience,"Kingspray Graffiti sets out to do one thing and one thing only: simulate the experience of spray painting stuff. You can pick different paint cans, nozzles, locations, and lighting to tag walls either on your own or with friends. Take pictures, share them, record 360-degree image stills inside the game of your work, and listen to preset music stations, or your own tracks, while doing so.

Many people don’t realize that King Spray was actually an Xbox 360 indie game released around six years ago. This latest iteration, Kingspray Graffiti, takes the concept and expands on it in every way, as well as adding your hands into the experience. That’s the real game changer here. The social aspects of Kingspray are great as well, as you can co-exist in the same environment with up to four other other wall bombers in real-time. Collaborating on large wall art is exhilarating and the simple teleportation movement makes it easy to access far-reaching areas of a canvas, as opposed to physically trying to move around a building in real life.","May 20, 2017 at 11:33 PM",5, 7,

The game is also extremely well polished even if some features with the phone are a tad clunky. If I would recommend any features I would add in a method of creating cutouts where you take an image and say flood an area with a specific color or select that color and it turns the rest of the image into a stencle you can use to paint a pattern.

Kingspray is just a JOY, it allows you to play with color, and feel empowered and emboldened to explore without consequences. You can even design your own stencils in photoshop / illustrator, and then bring them to life in Kingspray. The possibilities are massive. As a social experience it's fun as well, with people stopping by, and marveling or augmenting what you've been working on.

I'd also love to see a more vertical environment with ladders or lifts to create a mural. And the option to spray on other surfaces within the environment besides the main one (doesn't have to be everything - there are just prime areas that seem like they'd be perfect and they're non-sprayable.)

But sadly this effect only lasts a few minutes. For what this app does, it should be free. I fiddle with the UI on several occasions, like swiping the left joystick randomly around to enable undo-menu. Choosing colors is a pain. It feels like a bad approach to force you to use only what is possible in the real world. But because VR is not perfect yet, this really is distracting and not intuitive. For example there are artificial menus with realistic graffity-cans. Either there should be powerful menus or the cans should be real game objects.
I saw people teleporting up the wall to finish the upper side of their graffiti. I have no clue how they did this, can't find an option for that. So I need a lot of undo/redo for finishing things above me. Finally I stopped playing after using the ""Playback"" option which has a bug and leaves all undone steps in your drawing. My graffiti is a complete mess now - unrecoverable.

However, this game is plagued by bugs and poor performance issues.  hand tracking is a little buggy, which is murder when trying to work on details.  the UI is unintuitive and sometimes just doesn't work for left handed mode.  The floodlights on the train tracks don't light anything up properly.  These are the type of problem that Kingspray is riddled with, and keep the game from being a masterwork.
