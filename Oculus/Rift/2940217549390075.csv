2022-05-28 20:37:47.335897,bulbousbat,So much fun. So well done,"High value game. It's a game you can sit in a recliner and enjoy playing. Cast it to TV so friends can watch you play. C64 made these games a huge part of my childhood. The controllers on Quest 2 is so quick and responsive, no latency issues. So often latency in the controllers really destroy the retro game experience. This game is a joy to play. I could see the potential for a VR retro arcade, walk up to the machine pull the trigger and launch the game.","Oct 27, 2020 at 9:38 PM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 20:37:47.351854,MichaelCain,Does not work. Crashes instantly. :(,Does not work. Crashes before opening. I have tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it. I get a error log file to send to jatrix.de.  But Jatrix.de website is not interactive. NO email or contact listed! Do not buy.  My other VR games work.,"Apr 3, 2021 at 10:10 PM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 20:37:47.366814,asimura,No High Score Kept,"The game plays smoothly, however I was expecting the arcade machine to look like an arcade machine rather than just a window. The point about games like this is to beat your high score so it is unforgiveable it does not show these with initials.  The game runs smoothly and quickly. Better than my PS4 version. Also on the upside it is only a dollar (79p)!","Nov 27, 2020 at 5:33 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 20:37:47.381774,RuneSR2,"Simple game, but fun","This is a nice game, but it's extremely simple and it's not original - I wonder if the dev has obtained the right to make a copy of one of the great old arcade games. Even though it is not expensive, I have a hard time awarding this copycat more than 2 stars. 
Game runs fine using ss 2.0 CV1 with GTX 1080.","Nov 12, 2020 at 4:52 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 20:37:47.398728,xpsiter,Great throwback!,"A staple of the 80s, I had to install this game as soon as I saw it. Reaction time is quick! It would be nice to have a high score board, with initials, just like the arcade version.","Nov 25, 2020 at 5:16 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:37:50.543318,ca562dude,Welcome 1980's,"Wow Such a Great Memory from when I was a kid at the ARCADE ...   Please Make more of these Games.... Would Love to play ""TRON"" / ""DONKEY KONG""","Oct 16, 2020 at 2:46 PM",5, 23,
2022-05-28 20:37:50.558278,Hansolo-50,The 80s are just the best,Thanks to make one of the whole great games from the 80s for VR. Hope more of the great games from the 80s come,"Nov 3, 2020 at 4:23 AM",5, 8,
