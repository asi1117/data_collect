I have a computer with an i5 4670, 16gb ddr3 ram, and a gtx 1650 super, and it runs INCREDIBLY smoothly on my Quest 2 via link cable. The storyline is kinda short, but it is really good, with some major plot twists. Honestly a better storyline than most recent DC movies.

2022-05-28 14:52:39.094749,Icee_Ice,An actual honest review,"NO SPOILERS


Wow, so many people bomb this game....and for what?

1- gameplay
Pros
I ran this game really smoothly on my quest 1 connected to my pc, no problems, no jankiness, easily adjustable graphics in the games menu that actually make sense
Gameplay with controllers makes sense, works perfectly, the system with the utility belt holding gadgets is great
In the segment where Robin is talking to you, he doesn’t look too cartoonish, or lag the game at all
Solving riddler riddles and trophies is just the right amount of challenging
Cons
No fighting mechanics
Only three main items you use to interact with things, although the forensic scanner is multi use

2- story
Pros
The story is phenomenal if you know the Arkham games. If you don’t, look up their stories or try the game trilogy yourself, it’s a masterpiece. It’s a dream sequence (not really a spoiler you’ll know when you play it almost right away) feels like a bad lsd trip in a good way, and gets the job done. Perfect.
Cons
Honestly I don’t have any, keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time


3- addressing the main problems 
Yes, this game could be longer. But it ends on a great place, and the detail......blew me away. The attention to streak marks from a mop on the floor, light shading, a fully playable piano with sheet music that ties to the game, subtle hints, including many trophies you can get, and SO much detail. I have played many games, and yes, this one is short, but wow I have never seen a game where creators bothered with this much accuracy and detail, down to rendering so many things they didn’t even need too. Yes, there isn’t combat. But this game focuses more on the detective side of Batman with amazing precision and great story beats. Also, the collectibles are awesome. 


Overall-
10/10
Really, if you’re an Arkham fan, do it",Nov 21 at 10:04 PM,5, 54,

Instead I got the most non-immersive game I've ever played. I've dreamed about being Batman and taking down enemies with brute force martial arts. There is 0 fighting in this game entirely. The fight scene is just trowing like 3 batarangs and when you use a grappling hook, the screen turns black and you appear at the spot you grappled. This game was a major disappointment and upsetting to be called an Arkham game.","Sep 9, 2020 at 6:45 AM",2, 43,

2022-05-28 14:52:48.526372,alyssia.ma,The definition of VR experience,"Maybe this isn't for gamers or intense DC fanboys, but I personally loved this game. The amount of detail in this world is so surreal (from Bruce's bloody hands, to the batmobile, to his gadgets, to being able to stick your face right in Nightwing's). True, it was only a 1hr experience, but from beginning to end my mouth was open in awe like a kid in a toy store. Don't buy it expecting challenging gameplay or a true-to-the-comics storyline. I bought it because I wanted to experience a world that meant so much to me ever since I was a kid. For me, it did that and more. Hope there are more experiences like this being developped!","Jan 3, 2021 at 1:15 AM",5, 38,
2022-05-28 14:52:48.541332,TheElite316,I was expecting more. (No spoilers),"So, I found this game to be somewhat dissapointing as a VR game. It took me about an hour to beat, which I find somewhat lacking for a $20 game. There are these challenges you can do after (finding clues in the campaign), which I haven't done (and personally, I really disliked the plot). Also, after completing the game, I have to say that the trailer for this game is very misleading. You aren't fighting bad guys, flying around, or even driving anywhere; its mostly just solving clues and looking around. But what I found really bad was that this game lacks certain basic VR functions that I like to see in VR games, which includes the following:
-You cannot move with the touch controllers, you ""teleport"" to certain spots using A.
-You cannot look around (looking left and right) with the touch controllers, you have to turn physically.
-There is no option to reset the view.
I have a small space to use my VR, but this isn't a problem if you have a bigger space for your VR (and possibly more sensors). The only good thing I have to say about this game is that they do an okay job at immersing you into the world of Gotham City, and the graphics and sounds are pretty accurate, but I feel overall, this game really isn't worth the money.","Jan 23, 2020 at 6:08 AM",2, 57,
2022-05-28 14:52:48.556292,MSUnman,,Game crashes anywhere between 5 to 15 minutes in.  Playing using Oculus Quest Link with AMD RX 580. Very disappointing to waste money on something you cant play. :(,"Jan 31, 2020 at 12:09 PM",1, 9,
2022-05-28 14:52:48.572760,Leonidas-I,Worth the half-price value,"(Would have been 3.5 stars, but that's not available)
I've been a Batman fan for a while now, and an Arkham fan for a few years now, having finished Origins, Asylum and City.  And because of this it was truly a great experience due to the true-to-self Arkham style and pure immersion.  It is obviously quite short with gameplay lasting only about two-hours if you were to be taking your time (as I did), though rushing through would likely be closer to an hour.  However, I don't hold this against, the developers as VR games generally have a high-cost to make with a comparitively small price-tag.  
Pros:
-Excellent graphics, I loved how Wayne's bare hands were even visibly bruised.  
-Fantastic attention to detail, from the vehicles to characters, the environment and beyond.  
-Feels familiar.  Actually felt like the Arkham universe, with familiar environments, gadgets, features, characters and grit that the series is known for.  
-Decent playtime for the completionist.  Now, I know that many people who play won't bother finishing the Riddler challenges, but I am currently only four challenges away from completion.  This increases playtime from one-hour to almost five, which is a huge plus.  
-Decent story.  The story was decent, although somewhat disappointing when coming upon the revelation from the final level.  

Cons:
-Some control issues.  The Batarang Riddler challenge is OBSCENELY hard, as the auto-aim only works below a certain height--meaning if you are throwing at a high-up target, good luck, as you will only have the janky throwing mechanics to use.  
-Puzzles were generally too simple.  Would have preferred much more advanced and common use of the grapple gun and batarangs.  Perhaps the addition of other simple gadgets, such as the cryo grenade would have made the puzzles more elaborate.  
-And finally, too short with too few mechanics.  Each major feature (crime-scene reconstruction, object reconstruction, Batwing takedown, etc.) was used only only once.","Sep 7, 2019 at 6:21 AM",4, 38,

2022-05-28 14:52:51.725007,ksn,Good enough for demo,"Honestly this is a demo, no more no less.
A quest game where you visit several single scenes moving by storyline. Every scene has several fixed positions you may switch between to solve puzzles or doing some actions. You got few devices you may use in scenes to complete missions.
You can't free walk around or interact with objects that don't belong to current main quest or side quests. Nevertheless immersive is good, story intrique and you have some sudden situations make you heart beats faster. 
And traditional riddler pazzles of course! But after completing main story ;)
+++
- Excellent Gotham atmosphere
- Descent graphics
- Strong game base
- Fun quests and puzzles
- Great music and sound
- Intuitive interface

- - -
- Poor touch pads implementing
- Almost zero interactive
- The game seems to be a demo
- Many in-gamethings/active surroundings have no use (seems to be prepared for full version)
- To short
- To short
- And again TOO short

Resume: the game is good enough for demo, but not for finished product. It seems to be discontinued (game site is down) so it's not like we get some more batman stories nearest future. You may have good enough experience for two hours or so completing main storyline (or much more if you decide to get achievements and solve riddler puzzles) still, but i'm not sure the price for this game could be more than 10 bucks max so i can recommend wait discount.","May 22, 2019 at 5:38 AM",3, 29,

2022-05-28 14:52:54.822374,Palieus,My thoughts...,"Really enjoyed this title. The graphics look amazing and the story draws you in leaving you wanting more. My favorite moment is at the end during the prison scene. No spoilers …. You really do feel like the Batman :P

Now a few Cons: It’s not a game, it feels more like an experience rather than a full fledge title. Which is okay but it should be advertised as such. Also, the vehicles … sorry you never get to drive or pilot any of those, sort of a letdown; Would have liked to experience that. 

Lastly and this is what bothered me the most was the tracking notification tringle that kelp popping up in the middle of my visor. My controllers are fine and track well with my other games but seems to have an issue with this title. I keep having to bring my hands in front of my face to make this annoying warning go away.

It's really frustrating. The experience is immersive enough and the puzzles are fun to solves. I really wish it had some action in it. It could be one of the best game (the universe and the details are really good)

The gameplay in itself is beyond dull, absolutely zero action.  Don't get this game expecting to feel superheroic while playing it; the level of inaction for a Batman game is ludicrous.

Don't get me wrong, it's a fantastic one hour. But you wouldn't wanna play it again. The graphics will amaze you, especially when you go into the Batcave. Also beware, the size of everything will terrify you, especially if you've played the previous games in the series, as everything seems much smaller there. The story is really well thought out, and is canon to the other games which aren't VR, which is pretty cool. But a second negative is you don't actually get to see when you go in the Batmobile or the Batwing, but that actually makes sense why if you go deep to figure out the deeper story (I'm trying not to spoil it).

The gameplay is good, graphics rock, but just as you think you are getting ready for your first boss battle it enters a 360 cutscene deneaument and rolls credits. Personally I found I felt cheated financially as there was nowhere near enough gameplay in this to warrant the AAAtitle price I paid for this at its release, sadly its been too long a time between me buying it and getting time to play through it to be able to apply for a refund. I would probably buy the next installment in the franchise, but I'd be wary of reading reviews to see how long the campaign is before commiting to the decision.

2022-05-28 14:53:23.363323,LuluViBritannia,Easily the best VR game yet,"Batman : Arkham VR is a masterpiece. I know many people will argue : ""this is just a demo"", ""the gameplay is empty"", ""we can't move freely"".
All those complaints are true. Overall the game takes two to five hours to complete (depending on whether you'll rush it or explore and search the various Easter Eggs hidden around the different areas).
But despite the lack of actual gameplay, this game still offers among the best graphics for a VR game (obviously : this is Arkham after all!). Whether that be the textures, the models, or the reflection of the light, EVERYTHING is perfect visually speaking.
Sadly, there is close to no music at all, this is kind of a let down for me as the Arkham games usually offer us great tracks.
But a game, today, it's not just the technical aspect : it's also an atmosphere, and a scenario.
For the atmosphere, there is no argue here : we are definitely back in the Arkham saga. Everything is so grim! 
Story-wise, this is great but you have to know the Arkham games if you want to apprehend it. Indeed, Arkham:VR is tightly related to the other games! And, as nothing is easy for The Bat, nothing is explicitely said : you have to figure out by yourself what is happening, and when this game actually occurs in the Arkham timeline.
Besides, despite the few number of sequences, many of them are so enjoyable : whether that be the investigation on the crime scene in Gotham Streets, the inspection of dead bodies in the morgue, or the final act after the sewers, really, I don't regret playing this.

Finally, the puzzles were awesome. Some will argue that the game was easy ; I'll answer them ""how about you try decyphering the mystic radio message, by yourself? If you found it, that is..."".
So, in the end, this is Arkham VR : a poor gameplay (we can't move freely, and there is close to nothing to do, as the number of gadgets and their usefulness are limited), but a great story in a great environment. Definitely worth the price!","Oct 8, 2017 at 12:10 AM",5, 8,

The short length of the game is honestly IRRELEVANT, you spent over $1,000 to have VR, do yourself a favor and spend $20 dollars so that you can BE BATMAN!!!  

Now for the game!  I had chills the entire time.  Graphics maxed out (I have GTX 1080 ti) and its the most realistic, beautiful, enthralling experience I have had to date.  After being Rick Grimes in Arizona Sunshine, and Neo in SUPERHOT, I finally got to live out my childhood fantasy of BEING BATMAN!

I would love for these guys to make a ton of money on this short experience and either make a full fledged game on their own, or have Oculus studios throw an insane amount of money at them to make a longer experience.  There's actually a story arc, there are gameplay elements explored that I haven't experienced in other games that are fantastic.  You feel like detective batman, which is my favorite batman.  The experience is phenomenal, and enthralling.  It's also much darker than I had anticipated, which was a pleasant surprise (parents be warned).

There is replay value here as well, collectibles and little secrets to go back and look for, which is a great excuse to spend more time in this beautifully dark world.

Do yourself a favor, treat yourself to this wonderful little gem, and vote with your wallet that this game would be wonderful as a full length experience.

Graphics are outstanding. max all the setting out and you are in the world of Batman. Hand down the best graphics todate. and in some places so good i stepped back because i thought the joker was in the room for real. 

CONS:
-OMG short. THIS is more of a feeling of teaser status. just when it starts to get good credits roll. but there is bonus section to do the same story over and over and over to find easter eggs and then a match cards to unlock stuff. but its the same story over and over and ......
-You get to pick either car or plane and the screen goes black while you travel in said choice. WTF i cant drive either......
-Weapons = a grapple and CSI gizmo. 
-Some puzzles that are super easy. 
-$22 price tag. i mean come on this is what vr games are becoming? trailers, teasers. am i pissed at paying $22 for a game thats got F all for replay story... YES. i can only hope there is more coming. and free.
-ZERO fight scene you get to use fists, weapons. NOTHING.. you're more of the CSI batman then anything else. of find this bat xray that, grapple to plane you dont get to fly in, just a black screen and lots of cools sounds. Hey Grapple this!!!!
-Movement: just teleport and you dont get to choose they are premarked and very few spots.. no chance to explore the manor, cave nothing. 

this could be a 5/5 star but falls so short on its face. this is such a disapointment.

Over all, you want a exspensive thrill that lasts all of 30 mins. here it is at $22. aand believe me the graphics are just amazing. i will let friends try it just for that but, but at then end it will be the same responce.

I wonder if developers consider that playing with the mind in this way has the potential to cause lasting distress. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.

This game shows the potential and future of VR - it is stunning.  Yes, it is short but people are forgetting there is another experience after finishing the game by solving all of the Riddler's puzzles.  Once you solve a riddle/puzzle, you either unlock a character or vehicle which is very cool!  So overall there is more playability here than what others state.  Graphics are superb, - don't forget to go into options and turn up the pixel density.  Oh, and an undocumented feature: place your hand up next to your head and press the grab button - it zooms in to whatever you're looking at. Kinda cool albeit provides no functionality in the game... 
And lastly, I'll give you a more detailed clue why there is a huge Star Wars connection here...look at the credits and pay attention to  who voices the Joker in this game ;-)

2022-05-28 14:53:51.836889,LazarusG,"This was an excellent experience, but...","I'll start with the negatives. Specific location teleportation is getting old. I play too many games where I'm completely free to move around to be stuck to one location anymore, especially if I'm Batman. The transition blackout scenes made me sad. I thought I was going to get to drive/pilot a bat-vehicle and all I got was some noise and controller vibe. I really really just hoped it was my graphics card going out or something. It was WAAAAY too short. I've never played a game before that I was enjoying so much that I felt majorly disappointed when I realized it was over. It should have been at least two to three times longer, or half the price.

Now, I'm not a huge Batman fan, but after watching the preview, I definitely wanted to be Batman. Getting to suit up as Batman and
play with some of his toys was pretty awesome. The levels were well done and the characters weren't too bad. The whole thing put together looked pretty great. The story and puzzled moved along pretty well. There wasn't anything difficult or that took too much thinking. The controls were pretty intuitive and there was a fair amount of things to manipulate and although you had to jump from point to point, there was still usually enough freedom that it almost felt as though you could start walking around. There were a couple things that happened in the game that you just can't do as effectively outside of VR. That was pretty amazing. I really felt like I was melding into the character.

It definitely left me wanting more and I think that's what frustrates me about the price. I was expecting it to be longer. When I got to the end, I REALLY wanted it to be longer! I wanted more freedom as Batman. As it is, my family had to put up with a few days of me saying ""I'm Batman."" If it was 3 times as long, I'm sure my co-workers would hate me by now. I really hope this gets worked on more. It was one of my favorite VR experiences.","May 3, 2017 at 11:51 AM",4, 1,

It was my first VR games and I was totally impressed by how we could feel beeing in a world like that. The first sequence is awesome and some of the investigations really cool. The characters we meet and the way they move or talk to you is impressive. But let's be honest, 20$ is a shame, I bought Wilson's heart  45$ and it lasts much much longer, more immersive and so much more gameplay, puzzle or boss fights. Those 2 games are very similar but I can't stop playing Wilson's heart,  and do you know why ? Because it's longer than a demo!! : )","May 1, 2017 at 2:23 AM",3, 0,

However its not really a game more of a demo, take the VR away from this and no one would pay money for it. Its the sort of thing you would expect to get for free as a normal pc game demo. I cannot really recommend this one at its current price as a VR experience i would wait till it comes down to £4.99. Also it doesnt really make you feel like Batman from the previous games as there is no combat in it, you dont get to drive any of the vehicles, you just do a couple of the simple crime scene scanning elements you have seen in the other games in the series. In addition although i dont mind teleporting in VR games, as its better than feeling sick, this game only has node based teleporting - the same thing everyone is complaining about in Wilson's Heart.","Apr 27, 2017 at 12:50 AM",3, 2,

But you can look in the mirror and check yourself out as Batman! This should be a couple of bucks or free.
