It's not a bad idea. 
I think if you do a little bit of layout work and
For example, when isolating a muscle and writing the origin and insertion on the side, it is much more comfortable.

That was the first point. Now for the worst of it all.
The completely wrong scale and the controllers are not supported.

2022-05-28 15:40:20.520126,AColtRainSupreme,Better than other VR Anatomy apps - Med1,"Right now all I can say is that this is better for learning anatomy for medschool than the higher rated VR anatomy apps. Comments about the UI are sort of irrelevant. Other Anatomy apps with better reviews have great UIs but completely lack content. If you are a med student studying gross anatomy, you need to be able to learn all of the muscles (and their attachments), nerves, veins, arteries, and lymphatics (as opposed to just the main organ systems). Still, there are some completely necessary features that would be VERY high yield for studying gross anatomy for med students. 

1. A quiz mode would be extremely beneficial. More than just give the name of the bone/organ/vein/etc but describe the attachments/innervations/embryology. 

2. Right now portions are sectioned by system. Cadaver anatomy is not sectioned by system, but by region. It would be helpful to be able to load an entire thorax and then to run through the disection that way. Additionally, a ""whole body"" mode would be extremely helpful. It's nice to be able to review the muscles but without seeing the nerves at the same time, I'm afraid it just doesn't compare to other resources. 

Overall a great app for learning gross anatomy at the med school level but severely lacking due to the omission of a few vital (and somewhat simple to implement I would imagine) features.","Nov 6, 2019 at 7:43 AM",3, 31,
2022-05-28 15:40:20.535086,The_Witchdoctor,The free version on Oculus is better.,"I have to say I was sorely disppointed with this product and wish I could get a refund.  There is no turorial to assist you in learning how to use the product.  Further more I cannot find a way to rotate a view or move myself behind the object I wish to view.  The object is always presented just outside of the area where you can move around.  I tired to write the company about this, but the email system, that is only available on their website, just keeps giving an error message.  Don't waste you money.

Originally I downloaded the free version of another anatomy program.  It is not as in depth, but you can manipulate the image, rotate it, look under it, look inside it and you can change your point of view with a single click.  Watching the cardiac cycle or the pacreatic operation is very cool.  Use the free service and don't waste your money on this product.","Aug 9, 2019 at 8:50 AM",1, 28,

It's actually nicer to switch to floating in empty space rather than the weird painted-on conference room scene, which can make me ill if I move around too much.  The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the lack of action animations for the personal edition (this app), particularly muscles.  It's available on the enterprise edition, so why not include it here for everyone?  Will update to 5 stars when/if that becomes available.","Mar 31, 2019 at 4:44 AM",4, 15,

On the other hand, there is a good amount of anatomy content.  Devs, great content here, just make an oculus rift/touch worthy UI!  I would happily play double or triple the price for a good UI and gradually adding more content (e.g. muscles in articulation, things like hip glide, et cetera, teaching me positional nomenclature like lateral, medial, et cetera).","Dec 24, 2018 at 1:08 PM",3, 8,

As a healthcare professional I can say that the level of anatomical detail in this app is woefully lacking and the developer's insinuation that it will be of use to medical and allied-health personnel is blantantly false.

2022-05-28 15:40:30.007750,TrancerSpacey,Needs Touch support + better navigation,"For conveniant handling, the adding of support for Oculus Touch is a must. 

The zoom and rotation via Gamepad is not very smooth and it's not easy to adjust views precisely. In general navigation within the models should be optimized to be more conveniant. In my opinion a good way to navigate: when it would be possible to drag, zoom and rotate models like models in MEDIUM. 

A function to disable the cursor or set its transparency or size should be implemented too, because the cursor is sometimes hiding details you look at.

When this is done I will give 5 stars.

Good performance with GTX970.

UPDATE: I saw the Steam version has way better implementation of Vive controllers and interactivity. In comparisson the Rift version is not recommended at the moment.","Jan 7, 2017 at 11:54 PM",2, 13,

2022-05-28 15:40:33.146355,Centuraei,Terrible with the gamepad. Needs touch.,"Currently not worth 15$ at all. Desperatly needs Touch support and a lot of patches.

1) No translational movement possible. Say I want to inspect the lower digestive system, I really can't but rotate the model with his feet pointed at me and then start zooming in.
What leads to the second main issue:
2) The speed of zoom is terrible! It makes me nauseous. Even the most subtle bending of the right stick, catapults me toward or away from the model.
3) Overall, the way to interact with the model is flawed, making me nauseous after minutes. It feels like I would rotate around it, instead of spinning it in front of me.
This could have been fixed easily, by some static scene like a prep room. Instead I am floating in the white Matrix load scene.
4) The models are way too huge in their 3D environment. This leads to the sensation, of standing still while actually moving away or towards the model. At first impression I thought I had bought a GearVR app. Again, making me sick.

Minor issues are:
5) A press of the [START] button of the gamepad restarts the program, [SELECT] does nothing. I want to go to the menu, over one of these buttons!! To go there I have to press [B], focus on the icon for the menu and finish with [A].
6) The gamepad's triggers have no functionality assigned. They could have been used for translation (linear movement).
7) Can' say too much by now, as I couldn't stay long, but the possibilities of preping the body are very minor. I can't make certain categories transparent, only remove them completly by pressing [A] while focusing them.
As this is the first anatomy program for the Rift and cheap if compared to printed anatomy books, I don't criticize it, but mention it nonetheless, as I expect it from the next anatomy VR program I'll buy.

MISC:
8) It's all static. No problem, totally OK for 15$.
9) Poor synthetic voice reading the Latin names of body parts, tissue and bone. No problem again for 15$, don't expect any voice at all.","Dec 26, 2016 at 1:44 AM",2, 6,
