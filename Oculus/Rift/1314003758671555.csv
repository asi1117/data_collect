2022-05-28 18:24:20.845375,pendragn,Wonderful,"I paid for this app when it was a paid version, but now it seems there is a monthly fee as well.  No worries, I don't mind supporting apps like this, which push VR into areas other than ""gaming"".  This is a great app, and it seems like it supports same-account multi-player...meaning with my two headsets logged into one account, I can mindmap with my family using my same two headsets on my account.",Nov 30 at 11:43 PM,5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:24:21.176489,noizde,"Could use a paid ""basic"" tier","It's free and the feature set is a complete working product - BUT capped at 50 nodes, which is really not enough for such a large 3D space we could otherwise be occupying. So the ""free"" can really just be considered a free trial, not practical for anything I want to get into details of, not enough without compromising quality. Honestly, I'd be OK with a one-time fee for a bigger actually-enough-for-a-project node limit and then the optional subscription for the rest of the fancy features.",Nov 15 at 1:03 AM,3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:24:22.288515,feliciachavezSTM,How to save?,"I'm really excited this app exists. I'm not excited there is no user guide. (I had to search on YouTube and watch someone else make something in Noda to get the basics.) In fact, I can't even figure out how to save my work!","Mar 15, 2021 at 7:09 AM",4, 1,"Hello. Sorry there is no user guide. But there is a tutorial in the app that should appear when you first launch it. You can also view the tutorial at any time by pressing the app menu button (hamburger menu on the left controller) or the Y or B buttons on either controller. Then select the ""Tour"" button.

You also save your work from this app menu using the Maps tab. Hope that helps! Any other questions or comments you can reach us at contact @ noda .io"
2022-05-28 18:24:22.310458,athor333,i have to pay AGAIN ?,"wow ! just wow...

i have mind mapped for over 30 years. moving from paper to desktop and now VR...

this by far the best way for my brain to commit ideas and thinking to the external world. this software is a revolution for me. i cant reccomend it enough !","Jan 8, 2021 at 4:09 AM",5, 5,Noda moved from paid to free-with-upgrade on all VR platforms with intention to award all Early Access users the full version. Unfortunately Oculus platform does not have a reliable way to determine purchase date so we're using an imperfect method. If it doesn't work for you please reach out to contact@noda.io and you'll get a key to the full version with all improvements.
2022-05-28 18:24:22.337386,nurocept,On the right path but needs more work,"Be nice if the background could be changed, atleast the colour, a bit too dull for me. Couldn't find anything in the settings. Be nice to be able to write freely too.

Was hoping I could stop using my small whiteboard for mindmapping ideas but I guess I'll stick to that until this is improved more. Atleast the dull background/walls to something brighter.","Apr 30, 2020 at 10:36 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:24:25.472997,jpwells25,Finally an productivity App,"having A.D.D., planning can sometimes be a struggle when trying to map out your entire process in a moment. This App allows you to quickly make a node (a thought), voice text a comment over the node, and place it anywhere while you continue to process the rest of your train of thought. 
Seeing all of my notes in virtural space has helped me recover from getting lost in ""rabbit trailing"" to the point of losing focus on the origin of my origional thought. Working with architecture and engineering, this is a very common issue when reviewing all of the details and notes. 

Things that would be great to see added to the app, if possible:
.png, jpg, pdf import option.
Voice text edit:
 - each time I voice txt, it automatically deletes any words already in the note.
   Also, it times out very fast if I delay speaking an additional word by a second.
   This makes it a little tedious if the app fails to understand a word completely 
   and I have to go back, scroll through the note and edit manually each time.
List Below Node Option:
-It would really help the overall process to see a txt area below the node for quick sentance/paragraph decriptions
Traveling:
-Turning direction of focus with the controllers would really help. 

*to those reviewing comments, these are just minor requests to an incredible application. I still have total functionality with my primary use for Noda.","Jan 30, 2020 at 1:58 AM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 18:24:25.487957,IanRBland,"great start, needs work","We would need the following in order to be able to use it as a tool:
A)  Ability to adjust the size of the nodes.
B)  Circular links.  As in the ability to put nodes in a planetary orbit around other nodes.
C)  More MindMap logic.  As in master nodes, and subordiate nodes.
D)  A menu of standard labels & the ability to add new labels to them.","Nov 26, 2019 at 1:18 AM",3, 9,
2022-05-28 18:24:25.502918,HackJaw_brown6,Connecting with Employee,"Crazy idea, what if you can pull it out of your head, instead of discussing it out? I have a young employee who for his age is way ahead of the game. I have had trouble connecting with him, mostly because we agree how alike we are. I brought in the rift, which I am only running with a 1/2 power graphics card and it skips more than my sublime CD from high school. Everything does, not just noda, in fact it runs better than most. He coulden't even pick 1 career related goal that he wanted to attain - brain locked... so he picked ""Dream Car"" as the goal to reach.

I left the room for about ten minutes on a call and when I came back, he was essentially done with not only the finance based payoff idea to best suit his ideas, he had actually reached a career path by default during the process! 

One thing, though... I haven't looked at the file from the export yet, but how can you simply save the MM within the app? It appears the only way is to leave it up on the screen overnight... please advise","Oct 28, 2019 at 1:32 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 18:24:25.517877,Clickingtoenails,I love this! Awesome Planning Tool!,"All features working now so changing to 5 star. 
WHY is this amazing? Well for those of us who need a little extra something to get us working on those hard projects or problems, this software puts you where you want to be, and the music is perfect for putting you in the right frame of mind! Interface is easy to figure out. It is colorful, it is beautiful! Great for adding your own pictures and visualizing outcomes! Why 5 stars? BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING OUT THERE LIKE THIS!  Suggestions would be to add smooth moving, the teleport is a bit clunky for positioning yourself correctly in the room.","Jan 12, 2020 at 3:25 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:24:25.534832,DreamerO,Excellent Potential,"I've had this app for a little over a year now, but saw it on sale and figured i'd finally review it. Most notably this app helped me achieve my Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification. 

I'm a visual learner that regularly makes use of mind maps to help learn new subjects quickly. Mind mapping in 3D space is even more effective because of how much more engaged you are. Every layer of sensory information you add while studying adds to the encoding of new knowledge. 

I think one of the best productivity features is the talk-to-text. It took me a while to figure that part out. Once I did it made the map creation much faster","Mar 14, 2019 at 10:22 AM",5, 8,
2022-05-28 18:24:28.629555,Thum0s,"Love the idea, not sure about in VR","I love to argument map (or mind map). Every day I use an argument mapping tool called Rationale. I also love VR and use it almost every day. So why wouldn't I love argument mapping in VR? Well, maybe I do, but this program doesn't provide a very efficient framework for doing so. 

(1) I'm usually mapping out someone else's argument. This means I have to have a book in one hand and the mind mapping software open on my computer. I have to be able to see the textual source of what I'm mapping as I go. Currently, there is no way to do that in this program. One solution would be to allow users to import text documents that they could display in the background. 

(2) Typing in VR is always going to be a much slower process than typing on a keyboard. This makes argument mapping more tedious in VR than on non-VR software. I'm not sure what the solution would be to this, aside from speech-recognition, which I realize would probably be a major project to tackle for the developers.

(3) Having nodes with text-boxes on top is simply too limiting considering what one can do in other applications that aren't even designed for mind-mapping. Take, for example, Quill. This is a program that is supposed to be for art. Yet it's mind-mapping capabilities exceed the capabilities of this program. 

(4) Sharing. Yes, you can technically share your mind-map with other people. But then sharing via a program like Rationale is so much easier due to several factors. For instance, if I want to share my map with someone who doesn't have VR, then why bother making it in VR in the first place, given its limitations? There needs to be a ""multiplayer"" element to this program. Allow multiple people to share the same space simultaneously.","Feb 21, 2017 at 1:49 AM",1, 23,
2022-05-28 18:24:28.646509,Microship,Excited to see where this goes,"I can see the beginnings of a useful tool here; thanks for opening it up for early access. Updates will be fun... although it feels primitive at the moment, I'm already forming a wish-list: rubber-banding arbitrary connections, ability to have multiple links to an object with control over attachment points around the perimeter, image fill and transparent boundaries, user-generated and sharable libraries, busing to simplify long grouped pipes, clickable objects that open browser tabs or local PDFs, macros that can open internal details and zoom in... I am drooling over a 3D system design tool that escapes the limits of flat screens and pages. But first, how about an update with better documentation? Too much time fiddling with objects, trying to invoke text tool and other basics. It is clunky enough that I give up before doing anything interesting. Just the basics... PLEASE clarify the UI.","Feb 15, 2017 at 5:48 AM",4, 7,
