2022-05-28 13:29:35.364247,MallyDude,Not talked about enough!,"When i first got my VR headset i knew exactly what games i wanted: HL:Alyx, Blade and sorcery, Elite: Dangerous, and Pavlov. After i had those i went looking for new games, id scroll through oculus and everytime i'd see stormland, and everytime i'd write it off as garbage even though i had never seen gameplay. I dont know what i was thinking, because good god was i wrong. The controls just work, the guns feel great, the story pulls you in and the graphics are scrumptious. Everybody talks about how Half Life: Alyx was the greatest thing since sliced bread (which granted it might be). Some people say that Boneworks was the most revolutionary thing since the moon landing, but nobody talks about this game, and its a darn shame because it's possibly one of the best VR games out there, by far better than Boneworks and definitely in my top 5. A great man once said: ""It just works"" and that's what this game does. It just works.",19 days ago,5, 26,

2022-05-28 13:29:38.593199,Nebouxii,Reluctant Rating. Overpriced.,"I had looked forward to playing this game for so long. Sadly, I have spent several hours trying to getting it to perform well on my system (3070ti 8700k) using a variety of resolutions, supersampling, bitrates, in game settings, etc. It is frustrating at this point, and I will be blunt: it is an ugly game. This is a criticism of the rendering and color temperature. I like the world design and art style.  

That being said, this game does have some great mechanics, though irksome at times.  Climbing is a lot of fun. The holsters, while seemingly a cool idea a first, quickly become annoying when they swap your weapon loadouts or drop weapons without your consent. It doesn't do a good job at interpreting the user's intent. The hitboxes are quite large, and as the weapons pause in front of you, it is easy to accidently destroy it while trying to use an item stored on your chest. It is just cumbersome and unreliable. It would be nice to be able to turn of the haptics as well. 

After the first hour the game loop gets rather repetitive. The missions seem fine, but collecting alloy and squishing fruit becomes a chore, and something I would rather avoid. I don't really feel like exploring anymore as it is basically just limited variations of the same island assets. Not sure I will finish the game at this point.",Dec 31 at 11:18 AM,3, 9,

Well, in fact, it has surpassed what I heard. Having played titles Half Life Alyx, TWD Saints and Sinners, I can say that, to me, this game is a masterpiece. Since the beginning, it gradually builds up by allowing you to discover more and more in all aspects and ends up being a blast.

2022-05-28 13:29:41.739902,Dantheman825,Wasted Potential (Edit),"Edit (11/29/21): a few weeks after writing my review, 
I decided I'd come back and play Stormland, as it had been a while since I played.
Having replayed this game from the start again, I feel like I should re-evaluate my review a bit. I think the first time I played I came in with the wrong idea. 
I was sorta expecting some sort of really big story with a good campaign. 
But the more I was replaying this time, the more I realized that this game is more of a looter shooter with interesting lore, rather than a shooter with a meaty campaign. It's sorta like with Metroid Prime, where the gameplay is forefront, and the story never really gets in the way, but you can dig into it if you really want to. 
And the lore is pretty interesting I gotta say. You won't get it all though in one cycle, so it's one of the motivators to keep playing. The game also wastes zero time getting you into the action, no main menu when you start up, you just load into camp, walk to the pod, and head to the stormland, which takes like roughly 30 seconds total. The gun mechanics while servicable are still quite fun, though I do wish they added more. Though the multiple arms types you can use throughout the game add a fair bit to the combat. The enemy Ai is ok, it's not completely braindead, but it definitely could've been a bit better. Now overall, I still quite enjoy this game, however I still feel like $40 is asking a lot for this game, I'd say $30 is a lot more reasonable, but anything lower than $̴2̴5̴ ($20) would be a steal personally. I'm still incredibly disappointed that nothing more will be done with this game due to Insomniac's acquisition by Sony, so this game or its series will likely never have a future.",Jan 2 at 11:59 AM,4, 47,
2022-05-28 13:29:41.754862,NodnarbDB,Great game Period.,"Seriously great game, you can glide/fly, zoom across seas of clouds, climb tall pillars and the fighting is great along with the upgrade system.  It's like a Borderlands game set in Robot Pandora (From Avatar the movie) and you're a super robot with flying and climbing capabilties of a superhero.  Awesome right?  Hell yes it is and the more I play it the more I'm impressed.  It's HUGE, so much to explore.  How is this not the #1 VR game ever made?  

I could see the need for more combat/fighting.  Most fights are over pretty quick then you're back to harvesting alloy/ore.  But It's far more and far better combat than Half Life Alyx with a level of freedom Alyx never provided in a much much bigger and more open world.  I'm not very far in, I anticipate more fights.  But regardless this is blowing my mind.",Jan 9 at 7:46 AM,5, 1,

They pretty much stop in the middle of the story after you saved Nix and then continue with the ,,Weekly spire waves""(thats what i call it) But during these Weekly waves, there isnt really anything new, after you beated it 2 or 3 times. (I beated it like 20 Times) There are just more voice logs or androids that reveal a bit more of the story, but thats pretty much it. I wish they added an ending, maybe after you beat Terminus 5 times that then the humans come back or something, or at least something like a final boss.

2022-05-28 13:29:51.234377,thelevyisdry,stormland on low end specs,"First off let me start by saying this is not a great game for new vr players. If you just bought a quest a week ago stay away from this, because the movement mechanics are quite intense, and avoid especially on low end hardware (I played it on ryzen 5 1600 af 16gb ram and rx580) Although I didnt' experience motion sickness from these things plus repeated framerate drops and intense asynchronous space warping, I've had a couple of years of vr experience. I could very easily see a new player getting sick during combat when your framerate halves itself. If you do have lower-end stuff like myself but still want to try it out, I recommend you stick to recommended res in the oculus software, and stay on the selected presets when you first boot the game, even if it looks bad. For more advnaced players you can turn off asw in the oculus debug tool, turn on medium model lod and ambient shadows. anything more will cause constant performance problems and will effectively turn your gpu into a toaster.
review_
The game took be roughly 10 hours to complete (or
 rather loose interest in). You spend about a third of the time fighting the bad guys called ""the tempest"" a third of the time searching for things (usually keys to unlock a gate or something like that, and another third messing with your graphics settings. When fighting the tempest you are given an assortment of weapons to purchase or collect from dead enemies. There are 6 guns in total, all of witch feel unique and satisfying in their own right, as well as 4 grenades and various environmental things to weaponize. There isn't a great story here, just enough plot points to move you from objective to objective. I wish insomniac would optimize this better because a gtx 1080 is the minimum card is kinda ridiculous during this shortage. If you need an excuse to update the game, work on getting it on the quest standalone platform bc that's where the dough is. 

worth $40, but needs a better story and optimization.",Jan 23 at 10:15 AM,4, 11,
2022-05-28 13:29:51.250334,gerasmus,Big beautiful empty walking simulator,"Big open world with nothing to do. 
MAIN ACTIVITY:
Walkathon on islands searching/collecting fruits so you can improve abilities and shooting minerals to craft weapons supplies. Occasionally a gun fight that can easily be won.  
Missions are linear, you are cog and zero influence on the outcome. There are no side quests to obtain better weapons. 
Game respects your time. It loads almost instantly from SSD and drops you into last save without wasting time on main screens. Fortunately no loading screen between died and restarted.

Environment not interactive. Shooting wildlife, plants, rocks etc have zero effects. Everything is static. Although some plants/wildlife can be scanned there’s no reward for doing so. No purpose.
GFX: Gfx was low textured, low resembling 480p video in headset. Ultra on Quest 2 with Link cable and/or Virtual Desktop.  I couldn’t find a solution. On PC screen looked gorgeous. 

GUNS: 
Satisfying, especially the two handed mode or dual wielding. Other than ammo capacity I couldn’t feel any  difference between Level 1 and Level 4 guns. Guns have no weight, firing one handed mode didn’t feel any different in accuracy.
My fave favourite gun was the hand grenade launcher and the carbine. 

STORY: 
although there is one can be ignored because have zero influence on how it turns out. You are basically on a walkathon. 

ABILITY : 
Two most useful are magnetic chassis, another skill increases the amount of metal collection. Once I discovered how to vault I never used the increased jump height ability again. 


Worth $30? No. On Steam this game would have been -75% on many occasions already. games on Oculus doesn’t go for -75% deep discount. 
Spend your money on Half Life Alyx.

When this appeared there wasn’t much choice for story based VR, besides Asgard’s Wrath. Not much has changed since 10/2019 as 95% of VR games seems to be rail shooters, horde shooter or rhythm games. 

When this game released there wasn’t much choice in story based VR games.

I got immersed about 5-10 minutes into play.  

BUGS & Extended Review. 
First the bugs, annoying but not game breaking. Jumping onto rock faces I sometimes blocked bu invisible walls, hands clipping through transparent glass. Most objects are static place holders only, 9/10 crates are low textured static objects. 
Wildlife can’t be shot/killed, bullets pass right through. 
Enemies sometimes can shoot through walls.
When vaulting up a rock guns get dislodged and fall to the ground, then when I went back to recover the weapons disappeared. 
Weapons and objects fall through the surface. Happened many times.
Fruit and metal power ups can be inside walls or below the surface making it impossible to recover.
One can easily disassemble a gun by accident. 
The world is empty. Other than the mission objectives no interaction with any of the plants, electrical or mechanical objects.  Everything is simply a place holder. 
No side quests. Straight linear game despite open world.  
No reason or motivation really to explore, no special weapons to find.
All the islands are basically the same.
Enemies are easy to kill, predictable behaviour and they are virtually blind. It’s easy to sneak up and almost one shot kill them.
Guns feel satisfying, especially the way weapons fold out in two handed mode.
One back gun slot, since there is no weight on guns why only one slot on back? Maybe devs felt you would be too overpowered.

Gfx: Played on Ultra with Quest 2.
Viewed through headset looks like 480p video. Image on PC monitor is pristine beautiful.
Even on Rift CV1 the gfx was terrible low resolution. I couldn’t find a solution.

This game reminded me of another VR game with similar issues Seeking Dawn. Beautiful empty world with nothing else to do got abandoned by devs. 
Played 13-18/04/2021.

2022-05-28 13:29:51.281252,Alasjajo,B-E-A-UTIFUL gameplay!,"This game is super satisfying in terms of movement and general gameplay, introducing new enemies every so often helps keep my attention on the game and keeps me on my toes when exploring new areas. It can be a bit boring when the missions repeat, but I feel that it was MY fault for doing something wrong. I didn't always know exactly what they wanted me to do even with the wristpad so if you get this game, you need to focus a lot on the story. The ending was a tad underwhelming all things considered. It just felt like another part of the missions instead of it's own thing. There really wasn't any big boss to fight, just a bunch of the same enemys from before. The movement was super satisfying as well as the guns. The leviathan doesn't do anything throughout the game besides just swimming around. I couldn' play the game on high graphics but the graphics i played on (some area between low and med.) was pretty good. The way the game let YOU decide the attack strats was absolutly amazing instead of just saying, ""Don't get spotted"" or, ""Just bust in there in kill as many of 'em as you can"" was a good touch. Overall, lovely gameplay would reccomend. Will most likely update this review soon.","Jun 18, 2021 at 5:49 AM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 13:29:57.669870,BTFspooner,Very Clever and Fun Game,"This game features a Main Campaign that once beaten unlocks a cycling world that resets once a week every tuesday. There is a second story that becomes more difficult if you can beat that story before the cycle ends, and can also lose difficulty if you do not beat it before the end of a cycle. 

I came back to this game after abandoning it to play other games (I had just bought my headset and wanted to try mutliple games out). I am so happy that I decided to give it another go with some quality time to feel out the game. The game has many powerups and abilities that do not take too long to unlock, but also require a solid amount of grinding resources for. They don't make the grinding mechanic feel like it is too quick or too slow. Once you fully upgrade you abilities that influence how you glide and climb in the game you basically become a god that can climb and fly to any place that you can see. 

Combat is a little awkward to get used to but once you get the flow of pulling weapons out and which button combinations use your special abilities you go from being a little awkward to becoming a one man army nothing can stop.  AI is pretty basic, which makes lower difficulties boring once you have mastered them. I like to play games like this as stealthily as possible. Sometimes there are scenarios where you really do need to plan out your route, other times the AI is blind and you just need to either keep distance or wait for them to turn around. 

Why I recommend this game: The movement mechanics are exactly what I want as a VR experience. Climbing, flying, and ""surfing"" is amazing in this game and feeling like a robot god is pretty cool. 

#1 thing devs could work on: ""Beating"" the game/cycle is extremely dissapointing. Nothing really happens besides a cinematic scene as you fly away to let you know you beat the main mission.

If you're new to VR and are looking for a more console-like RPG/scifi experience, Stormland is a GREAT game to start with.  Same studio responsible for Ratchet and Clank, and you can tell.  The story is well-done and interesting without being overly kiddish, dramatic or complex.  There's plenty of campaign content to play through - not hitting many of the side quests and activities, it still took me about 12 hours to finish - and even when you're done, there's still plenty of stuff to do around the world just to enjoy the mechanics.  Which, by the way, are really solid.  Movement in this game - espeically the climbing, gliding and flying - works really well but can be disorienting to VR newbies.  There are some occasional glitches when picking things up, but it's never bad enough to really interfere with the experience.  Lots of modularity to your character's loadout and setup, though a few more guns would be nice.  It's a fantastic game and my personal favorite in VR so far.  I'd love to see a sequel or DLC produced more recently with expanded content and additonal abilities and locations.  Well worth the money!","Jan 10, 2021 at 7:56 AM",5, 90,

But for me, a person who completed Half-Life Alyx, Boneworks, TWD Saints and Sinners and couple others, Stormland is an unoptimized game, ignored by the developers after release. There is so much to be improved - HUD partially outside of field of view, constantly vibrating controllers due to holstered weapons, imprecise item grabbing... so much ""quality-of-life"" to be done, yet nothing's changed. Shame. Game is fun but sometimes irritating and the story should be longer, no matter if endgame is infinite.","Jan 11, 2021 at 5:13 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 13:30:03.966786,KT_Phoenix,Too many pc re-boots,"UPDATE:  No joy. I contacted the devs. The response just asked whether I had rebooted my machine recently and then went radio silent. Pretty dumb answer, since I had said the game was rebooting my computer regularly. I wanted to say 'don't teach your grandma to suck eggs' since I've been rebooting computers to solve problems since the days of mainframes. Instead, I'm updating this review.

I did try Stormland in my new Quest 2 via a link. Same issues except that the Quest 2 controllers are more awkward. Fingering controls and aiming guns is a bit harder without my three cameras used by the original Rift CV1. 

Original comments:
I really like this game except for how it behaves in failure. It kills Oculus and often either causes a restart of my pc or requires a cold boot to recover. Not cool. I don't run into this on any other Oculus Rift or Steam game.","Feb 18, 2021 at 3:11 AM",1, 8,

The graphics are lush but very washed out. From the screen shots I was expecting a very bright, vibrant world but the atmospheric effects keep everything looking bleak and washed out. I'm sure it an LOD thing so that anything past 50' can be rendered with little detail. The climbing is really glitchy and the gliding is fun but gets old quickly and the areas are limited. The guns are okay but you are limited to whatever ammo they carry and it runs out quickly so the gun play is always being interrupted by scavenging. Makes for a less than engaging  experience. Thats okay though because there are only a few enemy types to shoot anyway and the AI is brain dead. It's very short for the price with little replay value.
Overall it just feels like they built a game engine but forgot to include the game...or much fun.","Nov 30, 2020 at 11:06 PM",3, 22,

Hearing Insomniac Games was developing a VR game, I had to get my hands on it. Stormland has been an absolute gem to play. The weapons feel good to use one handed or 2 handed. Dual Wielding the weapons is super fun, especially with the SMGs. Riding the clouds is super fun. The loadout customization is incredible. When you complete the story, there is incrimental replayability with each week getting more and more difficult. This game deserves a 5 star rating.

Pros:
   -Replayability Value is High
   -Gunplay is Smooth
   -Lost to Explore
   -Playing with a Friend is Very Fun

2022-05-28 13:30:19.815898,zombiesheepx,,"If it was a longer, more intuitive game with more content, I would have probably given it a 5. Let me start by saying I have not been much of a gamer since the days when Mario 64 was cutting edge. Stormlands was highly rated, so despite the $40 price tag I took a chance. The game seemed very low res til I realized I could up the graphics (again, not a seasoned vet). The game mechanics are good, but glitchy. Sometimes it's hard to manipulate the climb function, and it's not intuitive which surfaces can't be climbed. Sometimes I would reach for a grenade on the ground and get the gun on my back holster (no idea why that happened so often). Sometimes the game completely glitched out. Before I realized you can usually toggle between sitting and standing to fix it, I had to frustratingly reset. The body upgrades are frustrating as it took a while to realize both aeon buds (of which I now have 29 useless buds) and growth points are necessary for SOME upgrades. There just isn't enough flora and fauna available to get all upgrade slots unlocked and used before the next world reset. Which is a really weird  and initially frustrating concept (After a day of playing, I lost all my body upgrades), but probably just a way to introduce new content into a 5hr game (world reset comes with new flora and fauna? I don't really know the extent of it yet) so that you can keep playing and hopefully feel you got your money's worth (in the absence of additional content). I'm not sure hom much more play time I have before I get bored and give up on it. But the graphics are amazing (once cranked up), and for all it's glitches, the climbing feature is fun. The enemies were a learning curve as I tend to treat all games like an rpg and try to level up then fight everything head on, or try to snipe everything from afar. I got used to sniping but it was never efficient... the game needs a good sniper rifle.","Aug 14, 2020 at 8:42 AM",3, 8,
2022-05-28 13:30:19.832852,Marclev78,"Fun for a bit, but then gets repetetive","The claims of ""open world"" are a bit of an exaggeration. In each map you have several islands that are connected with an ice field that you skate around by moving your arm in whatever direction. The islands mostly look the same though (there's only 1 biome basically) and the only thing that really changes is your abilities and the strength of the enemies that you face. You can visit them in any order you like, but there's really no reason to go to one if you're not being sent there as part of the current campaign mission.

So in a nutshell, it's fun, with some really innovative abilities (by the end of it you're basically flying around like a super hero), but hasn't got much replay value after you've experienced everything the game has to offer.

I feel like I got my money's worth out of it, but am in no rush to pick it back up again.","Aug 3, 2020 at 4:08 AM",3, 12,

At first I cranked everything up to Ultra and it didn't work very well, a lot of stuttering - but then I reduced every setting to the lowest and started to check each setting individually. Turns out that I can set nearly everything to Ultra, but real time shadows must be deactivated - and temporal antialiasing must be used for the CV1 for best performance and image quality. Note that I'm forcing super sampling (ss) 2.0 using Oculus Tray Tool (OTT). When using OTT, OTT totally overrides the in-game res scale. I checked using the OTT Pixel Density HUD that ss was indeed 2.0. 

Optimal setting for GTX 1080 (Ti) using CV1 may be:
1. Deactivate real-time shadows (you still get nice shadows, maybe real-time shadows are for the RTX 2080/3060 Ti...).
2. Set everything to Ultra. 
3. Make sure to use temporal antialiasing (SMAA is probably the optimal choice for lcd HMDs, but may increase gpu burden more than temporal). 

- and then I stepped into the most amazing VR world I've ever seen. I've only played a couple of hours, but for now this doesn't feel like a 10/10 game to me - feels more like 14/10, lol - especially compared to other games I've rated 5/5. I really think - for now - that Stormland goes way beyond the normal rating scale, because this game truly feels like the new VR reference. The game is completely smooth on my system, but it's not solid 90 fps, although I do get 90 fps occasionally. 
Stormland totally looks like a ""system seller"" to me. The amount of detail added to this game is breathtaking. 
Not sure I could ask for more - this feels like the VR game of my dreams. I love sci-fi much more than Vikings. Maybe I should write a big thank you note to Zuckerberg, but he's probably busy playing the game, lol. I haven't been as excited for any VR game since Lone Echo.",14 days ago,5, 147,

Locomotion: It's Mainly Smooth Locomotion, which is great. But not as good as Lone Echo's ""Drifting."" But Gliding is where the Locomotion truly shines. It's on par with Lone Echo's ""Drifting"" Gliding through the Sky Feels so amazing and natural.

Story: So much action and grinding, it's a grinders dream come true. First 5 hour is the main story. Then there's COOP, then there's the ""End Game"" which lasts about 4 months. I just finished the game after playing it since release!

Overall: If your a grinder or a Adventurer - this is for you, you'll get about 200 hours if you milk every minute of it. But 200hrs for $40 is a steal! This game is so great you'll want to savor every second of it.

2022-05-28 13:30:29.336639,Conejeros,Great VR experience,"Stormland is an open world game that puts you in the place of an amazing Sci fi character, that can glide, slide, shoot enemies, get invisible, and such and such. It is really well done, it´s an amazing experience, first of its kind. The graphics are very good, the landscape is big and while homogeneous, is fun to explore. 

However, its 6+ hours of a not very intersting campaign downgrade the game to just another great ""VR experience"". The feeling of progression is minimum, so after the campaign you are left with a big world to play, fun, but fairly repetitive. 
In my opinion, this is probably one of the best VR experiences out there, but hence, it feels like most VR experiences: incredibly amazing at first, then repetitive. While it is worth trying it, I consider US$ 40 a bit too much for just ""the experience"". See, Alyx VR is an actual full VR game (story, progression, replayability, etc) that is also a great VR experience. Stormland is mostly a VR experience, at twice the price.","Jun 21, 2020 at 12:51 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 13:30:29.352596,Nicko844,My favourite VR game to date,"Bought this with my cousin to try co-op VR for the first time and everything about this game just blew my expectations out of the water. The stunning enviroment, sounds, voice acting and story all work wonderfully together to have the player fully immersed. The controls are satisfying and the combat is beyond fun. Taking out enemies has never been more fun in VR to me than in Stormlands. The movement is fluid and free, and with multiples ways to get around- Traversing is never a bore.

One thing I will note is that you will have to get through a mandatory 20-40min intro before you can unlock co-op but once you do it's an uphill ride onwards. There are also a few minor bugs such as certain interactables not working, or getting stuck/glitched in a tight set of rocks or terrain with no way out. Which my only fix was to restart the game. Fortunately the game takes on average for me about 20 seconds to load into as this game has an exceptionally quick load in time.

100% Recommend it solo or with a friend, you're in for an experience.

Running, jumping, flying, skiing, climbing, all great ways to put yourself into the adventure. Being able to shoot and climb at the same time or drop down from a cliff and blasting bots with two guns is always fun.

However I have no idea if it is either me or the game, but when skiing on the clouds, I seem to get severe lag. I turn, but only 5 seconds later do I actually change direction. As well as my left hand always wants to leave my body or shoot even though I let go of the trigger. The only way to stop shooting is to let go of everything. The minigun, my favorite weapon to look at, cannot be used as it gets 5 shots at my target and the other 300 at the sky off camera, even worse if I go two handed mode on most guns.

There's little interaction with the world outside of the stuff they particularly want you to interact with, which is a bit disappointing, especially when you see something like a wrench on a desk and go to intuitively pick it up and absolutely nothing happens (worsened when you can even shoot it or knock it around or anything). The world seems a bit too scripted and forced, at least in the hour or two I've played. The controls and stuff aren't quite as intuitive as they could be, which I've noticed is the case with many VR games since coming off the excellent Half-Life: Alyx. It lacks even the most basic stuff like convincing ""bullet"" decals when you shoot stuff.

Much of my positive experience was observing the several detailed landscapes and wildlife. It would have been nice to see this game in higher quality (GTX1080 played smoothly on low/medium display settings), but the performance at higher levels is less than stellar. Compared to the 2020 released games, the textures in this game are not quite up to par, but still good enough to be immersed in the world.
 
I disagree that the character upgrade tree should be reset after each progression in the late game. Part of the fun is getting such a character to be as strong as possible. Perhaps the tree should only be reset either by player's choice or completion of the final escalation. Otherwise, I lose interest in collecting aeon buds only to lose them later on.

It would have been great to see future content and updates for this game, but I understand that Insomniac is now part of Sony and are not obligated to continue working on it. A shame, but I will still give this game as-is a solid thumbs up!","Apr 17, 2020 at 9:46 AM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 13:30:41.969754,SovietFridge,The most underdeveloped AAA,"I was thinking Asgard's Wrath was running low on budget, but it was not as bad in comparison to Stormland. Actually AW looks awesoome after this. Stormland screams about being unfinished. They could create a lot of missions with few lines of story in between.
But when you are not even sure if you can grab a gun from your hip on the fly and not health canister, and when you are not sure if you will grab the gun with both hands not disassemble it that is when you realize that the game was made in a haste. So fast-paced action is only possible in this game when you get ready and pick up the right weapon and never swap it in combat. If you take your time and approach everything slowly it's a good stealth action for sure, probably better than Espire 1. You might even want to use a sniper rifle, should be fun. Except it isn't, sniping in this game was not finished also, it's a pain to snipe here. Carbin is fine, but trying to find a red dot on blurry light background is the most annoying thing you can do in the game.
You can't pause the game, something that people do to have a break from vr, browse internet maybe, and you have to mute the game in volume mixer if you are going to watch youtube. Sitting/standing mode is broken, it can default after you take off your headset and take it on again, but in options the mode you chose will be still on. Oculus exclusives seem like a scam in comparison to Alyx and Saints&Sinners. They have developed great setting and great climbing and travel mechanics and then they stopped, and Oculus didn't even give them more money to actually finish the game","Apr 19, 2020 at 5:46 PM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 13:30:41.986709,JackDiddley,Worth The Wait,"This game was on my ""Coming Soon"" wishlist for a long time and when it finally arrived it did NOT disappoint.  I wanted to play through on all of the escalation levels before reviewing.
Character customization and multiple weapon types, with different play styles is remarkable.  Traveling around in the environment is excellent with gliding and slipstreaming, especially if you get the right perks.  If I had any complaint at all it would be just MORE.  I found the perks to be pretty hit or miss, some of them are useless are even a hinderance.  I wish there were a way to reassign the buttons because the same grip button is used for everything while other buttons are unassigned.  if you grab you might grab the ground to fling, you might grab to accelerate while gliding or slipstreaming, or you might end up with one of your guns in your hand.  It would be nice if you could ""favorite"" certain perks so you know what you had before when the world resets.  If there were more perks I might want to try some different things but as it stands I pretty much just want the same perks every time.
That being said the game resets keep it somewhat fresh, although a bit repetative.  Aside from completing missions there is much to explore to find all of the collectibles.  Just zooming around from island to island is a lot of fun but I would like more to do.   
Overall this game is a great play and was certainly worth the wait.  I want to play Vesper in other games, it was so easy to become comfortable with the character.

The arm animations are a bit glitchy which takes away a bit from the immersion but everything else seems to be really well polished. The only real issue I've been having is with the tracking - something weird happens to the Oculus Touch tracking when you turn your head. It's hard to explain, but as you turn it to the right, your hands move to the right slightly with it. Same as to the left. This feels weird when in menus as you have to stand completely still in order to accurately select options, same is for when shotting a gun. that slight deviation makes shots miss which is frustrating.

Only played for an hour or so, and will continue updating this review as I get further in, but so far it seems to have a good narrative and gameplay mechanics are solid. The movement and traversal mechanics take some getting used to but eventually you feel like a godlike little robot climbing everything and sending yourself flying with the flick of you hands. 

I only wish the pesky vertical limit was more obvious as there was a part where (mild spoiler) you have to climb an elevator, and it isn't obvious where to go, but once you hit a certain height, it just kinda...stops working. I thought the tracking problems were happening until i realised it was a height constraint, which isn't made clear to the player (the building keeps going higher, why can't I?)","Jul 26, 2020 at 4:35 PM",3, 0,

It still was fun as hell and thus one of my favorite VR games, however, a few patches later they introduced a big problem. Now, as soon as you move your head in any direction to look around, your arms/hands somehow weirdly jitter and move in the complete opposite direction, then they abruptly snap back in place to match your real hands when you stop doing that. You basically feel like you have zero control of what your hands are doing while moving your head. It messes up your weapon aiming, the orientation of your shield (so imagine either shooting at or blocking an enemy and as soon as you turn your head to look at your surroundings you either miss your target or get hit by its attacks even though your hands remained in place in real life), pretty much everything you're doing with your hands and it just looks BAD. It was NOT like this at launch so any claims about this being because of the inverse kinematics and how the game is supposed to behave are simply WRONG. I submitted a report once months ago but nothing has been done since. I'm using the original Oculus Rift with three trackers, I don't know if it's like this on the S too but either way, it used to work properly, now it doesn't and makes the game so annoying it's unplayable even though you can technically mind how you move around, rely more on the analog stick to turn around than your head (so what's the point of 360 VR then) and still complete it.

It can be fun getting into a firefight with enemies and the mobility of your character is nice, but it feels like there's too little variety in the enemies.  The weapons also feel quite unbalanced: after trying every weapon, it feels like you're better off just getting upgrades for reducing spread and adding autoaim and just using the submachine guns for everything at least as far as I reached.

The key there being ""as far as I reached"" because just as I was starting to enjoy the game for what it was, I ran into a bug blocking progress.  I've completed mission objectives necessary to get to the end-cycle area, but it won't let me go.  I've yet to escalate at all and already I'm stuck having to wait for the cycle to begin again to even have another chance to continue: quite frankly, the game isn't fun enough to put up with this bug.","Mar 16, 2020 at 9:21 AM",2, 3,

There is no lasting incentive to keep returning to the game, the cycles don't significantly change anything up and at this point there's little to no hope that we're ever going to see any kind of future updates. 

Co-op is its saving grace, but even that doesn't hide the fact that you're doing the same mission over and over. The game is also very easy. I managed to max out my aeon bud upgrades in just one cycle (!). Once you've done that, nothing in the game poses a threat anymore. For a game that's supposed to keep you engaged for a long time, blowing right through all the upgrades in one week isn't how things should be. Some of these mechanics evidently needed more time in playtesting so things could have been balanced better.

This game was rushed to market and is really underdeveloped as a result. For a $40 game, it's a bit of a ripoff.","Feb 24, 2020 at 10:08 PM",2, 9,

s this the message I should read ""thoroughly""?

At first I wanted to write a review that kind of mirrored my experience with this *******@$&^$#!@#$%^&, but that would have meant I'd leave a review with all spaces and nothing else

The brilliant geniuses at Insomniac games have written a game that wants to ""sync"" the very first time the program is ran, just out of curiousity... sync what, with what?
Can't be my saved games, that's for sure
How can software be written so poorly that it doesn't even run a full second (Yea, yea, I get it, it does run and/or doesn't try to sync for other people the very first time, and that makes it better for me... how?

Just fix it, don't take the lazy way out, by offering me a refund
Just fix it so I can at least write a review about the actual game (though I don't really believe that fix will never come, this error pops up in some other games too, but we are such an insignificant number of players and then also split up over too many games, so it's easy to just ignore us, and our annoying bug

You've already included an excuse in the ""what's new"" patch notes (the game probably won't be able to ""save to the cloud"")
""What""s new?"" indeed

I'm not angry, I'm disappointed that this turns out that you're just another bunch of people who care about only 1 thing, (potential?) shareholders
Th hype turned up my expectations way too high, and all I get now is 15+ Gigs of trash on my drive

So far it's everything I wanted Asgards to be and wasn't. You get into the game/action/story right away. The game teaches you gameplay mechanics while progressing the game, not by making you do tedious, pointless tutorials. From the first hour and a half in game, it's an open world, objective based, fps. It's great. Graphics are amazing and so far I haven't had any glitches/crashes. Looking like a AAA game without playing for 10 hours before you get into the fun part. THANK YOU!
*EDIT/UPDATE*
After playing about 6 hours now I'm extremly pleased with the game. One of the cleanest and most beautiful VR games I've had the pleasure of playing. I have two issues however. 

PROS
-Great graphics
-Great moving mechanics
-Good story
-Enjoyable gameplay 
-Variety of upgrades and weapons

CONS
-Sniper rifles are pretty useless as the zoom function, although looks neat, does not zoom in much at all and when it does there is no reticle with which to aim. Major let down for me cause the game could really take advantage of the landscape with good sniping. 
-AI is pretty braindead. For the most part you can bum rush a group of 2 or 3 with a minigun with minimal worry. Turret defenses are a different story. Couldn't find a difficulty toggle to increase enemies or AI pressure. 
-Possibly short. I haven't finished the main story as I like to explore everything. And if you do too then you'll have plenty to explore. But I think that the end is coming soon as the storyline seems to be hinting at a final boss style fight. This last one is complete speculation.","Nov 15, 2019 at 2:48 PM",5, 256,

2022-05-28 13:31:07.354326,davide.croci.371,could b five stars with few tricks :D,"first of all: great game!
the core mechanics are fun to play:
glide and fly through islands, 
run n dive  on the sea
bot fights are rich and guns response is good
stealth approach to the game is doable
gorgeouse graphics and good sound
really touching idea of merging bio with mechanical

weak points that dev can fix with patches (and get 5 stars :DD):
game core concept is repetitive, wich is not a bad thing, but you have to:
1) better the challenge by letting ppl raise game difficulty without having to wait for the next cycle (for example make a repetitive in-game quest that raises overall number of enemies and their lvl so that each palyer can fine-tune the game difficulty to his own likes)
2) increase variety by, for example, introducing BOSS FIGHTS! put in game facultative random named enemies of outstanding strenght to test player might:D. Do more environmental research quest for bio hazard and flora wich are cool but can exploited more with more complex jobs to do than just scan stuffs all around

3) why just three waves?? this game can last for ever :D u can give an ending at third wave finishing but u can also allow player to go on endlessly in difficulty and fun with no waves limitation!

make a mix of theese hints and something and this game can become something every player will keep playing for muuuuuch time!

thank you for your efforts so far,
waiting for an expansion and few good patches :D

2022-05-28 13:31:07.407184,Kevin_Brook,Shallow but intensely playable,"I was fortunate to get early access to this game and I have to say I've enjoyed it a great deal. It's beautiful to look at, runs flawlessly and the movement mechanics are truly exhilirating. In many ways it's the most playable VR game I've played to date. Combat is satisfying and fairly sandbox, you aren't funnelled into attacking enemies in a specific way. Play with stealth, or go in hard, it's your choice. It's a little unfortunate however that the content is rather barebones. No decent single player campaign, story is so so and crafting side to the game is so rudimentary it might just as well not be there. If you're looking for a stylish shooter to play with a friend this game will definitely scratch that itch. However don't go into this expecting a great narrative story or any RPG elements, this is a stripped down shooter that takes place on large maps that change weekly. Enjoy it for what it is and you'll have a great time.

I've been playing since I got a CV1 in 2017 and on a Rift S now.  This game feels like it really pushes the medium forward.  Looks amazing and the traversal is fun to do all by itself.  We spent a good 20 mintues just climbing trees and jumping around the forest like some kind of monkey/flying squirrel/robots and laughing maniacally.   Good times.  

I would also like to compliment the devs on making the multiplayer dead simple.  I hit a button on my hand and joined my buddy's game, spawned across the map from him, zipped over to his island superman style and came to a sliding halt in front of him and he's like ""hey, when did you get here man?""  That's how it should work! Easy, great voice comms, no stupid connection problems, didn't have to set anything up or even send an invite, awesome. We have tried other coop games in the past and had many techincal issues and even given up without ever getting to play together, this game sets a great standard for how that should be done properly.  

Great work on the positional audio too.  Very immersive when you are brushing past foliage or your coop partner says something from behind you.

Only about half way through the second Strata and I hear the stroy is short, but I am having a blast just using the world as a playground and I feel like one more session like the one I just had would already justify the price.

2022-05-28 13:31:16.875156,kalfax,First time playing this game...,"The game's quite fun! I can play it on ultra, but unfortunately i get framedrops during cutscenes. i'm using a 980 ti, so might be due to that, or might be due to only having 16gigs of ddr4 ram. 

What i like about the game, well... i enjoy the climbing and the surfing or whatever. jetpack is nice too. i'm not too fond of the guns, so i mostly use the laser you start with. the guns sight is a red dot which is hard to see sometimes, so i don't really use the weapons much right now. i feel the game is fun but will get repetitive fast, though it's a fun vr game so far, ive got a few hours played so far. the upgrades are nice, n i love that we get more and more new abilities for the robot we play as. 

i like the scanner you get which makes it easy to find minerals and enemies also, i keep using it almost all the time. 

the graphics are good, but i feel like it would be better if i had a better gpu maybe, but looks nice enough. the biggest problem i noticed while playing was that my knees started hurting a bit, since you don't crouch often, and stand still most of the time, it can make you very stiff in the knees. this isn't the only game with that issue, however i wanted to point it out. 

i like that the game shows you where you have to go, but at the same time not showing the whole map, it makes you explore stuff more, but ofc you also explore to get more materials. The enemies are somewhat easy, i'm taking them down easily with the beginner laser, which i haven't been upgrading, all i have is a lifesteal upgrade on my robot, and one more thing which i forgot what was, so i'm still early on in the game. the robots usually have level 1-2 weapons on them when they die, and even though i have picked up two of those level 2 weapons, i don't use em much, mostly due to low ammo, and for some reason you can't reload weapons in this game, but instead swap em with new ones, and scrap them for materials... i guess it's fine but i'd like more upgradability with a weapon maybe.","Feb 20, 2020 at 1:21 PM",4, 0,

UPDATE: The game not starting is some sort of obscure memory issue. I have to close a bunch of applications for it to work despite the fact that I have 64GB of RAM.  I was playing this on a GTX 1080. This is the recommended GPU but a GTX 1080 is not enough for smooth gameplay. I upgraded to a RTX 2080Ti and now it plays very smooth.  This is an enjoyable game and I do not regret buying it.

The developers really seem to have delighted in creating a lush and organic world in which to embed their technology based story. The otherworldly plant life alone is worth the price of admission. Reminiscent of Star Trek the Original Series and No Man’s Sky alike. 

Voice acting is superb and heartfelt. Some of the robot characters gestures and personalities are really endearing, which provides some welcome relief from the devoid of human life techno-sphere. 

If you find yourself generally overwhelmed by the frenetic pace and violence of shooters, you’ll be eased into the shooter aspect of this game. The first hour or so is mostly exploration and acclimation into the story and world of Stormland. By the time combat ensues, its exciting but isn’t overwhelming. I’m about two hours into the game and can see the combat aspect ramping up. Still it’s a comfortable and intriguing pace.

1: Riggs and my onboard AI should no longer tell me when I have a lot of alloy/Aeon buds because thanks to the palm-mounted objective menu, I can look at my alloy/Aeon stash whenever I want. 

2: I propose a new upgrade for the mod-station that allows the player to replace their dominant arm as well as their auxiliary arm (For example, one could have a maser arm on their left, and an static electricity arm on their right)

3: All weapon schematics lost after Terminus should be partially refunded as alloy, similar to how skills are refunded as growth.

4: When I am nearing the Spire Cell strongholds, a variety of glitches happen. For example, I can't hear the sounds or feel the vibration in my controllers when I grab an object or climb a wall, or the exact opposite: The controller aggressively vibrates in my hand for no apparent reason. Also, is the lightning on the central, square pillar really necessary? I think it looks cool with just the pulsating, purple glowing strips, and my computer can hardly handle it as is.

5: That's another thing. I am playing this game on an ASUS computer with intel Core i7 and a Nvidia Geforce GTX game card, yet the game starts to stutter and lag at the most crucial moments despite having the lowest settings, leaving me vulnerable to my opponent's attacks. I'd rather be directly killed by the Tempest's firepower and military might than be killed by lag. It is dishonorable.

I'm about 5 hrs in just reached the second world to explore and the upgrades are so much fun to find and equip. The guns are fun and the robots can sometimes give you a challenge but so far they have been fairly easy. This adds to the feeling of power it gives you though in my opinion and is not a negative.

2022-05-28 13:31:20.101593,tacomcca,Updated Review after 12+ Hours,"Update: After spending enough quality time with this game I can't give it a 5 star review. It has the making of a great game but just lacks the content to keep me coming back and wanting to play. Perhaps my expectations were too high for this title, but it is far from the epic AAA sci fi game oculus promised this to be. Is it fun? Yes. Is the mobility excellent? Yes. Is the gunplay engaging and fun? No, not really. The guns have no real ""heft"" or weight to them and they feel flimsy. 

First Review: Beautiful graphics and voice work hooked me from the start. The best part of the game is the mobility it offers the players. You can climb, fly, drift, and soar across the storm lands. Each little island seperated by clouds has trinkets and collectibles  that you can use to unlock new abilities and stats for your character. Combat is good enough that I had to think about how to tackle a hoard of tempests and the way the guns handle are satisfying. You can take any weapon and use your other hand to grab it, this augments the gun and it looks great! I've heard of people blazing through the missions but I am having a blast exploring at my own pace. This game will probably be looked at in the future as a milestone in VR open world games.","Nov 17, 2019 at 3:00 AM",4, 69,

Only stopped playing because it got to hot in my room and standing up for 2 hours isnt good for my back atm.

2022-05-28 13:31:23.249219,callenshaw,"Lots of fun, when its not buggy","Read all the 5 star reviews to know that this game feels awesome, but the number of bugs I've hit in less than 10 hours of play are unacceptable. Controllers getting their vibration state stuck, map objectives not updating correctly, objects getting stuck inside geometry (at least for this one, you can stick yourself thru walls to compensate!). But especially the map / objectives. Multiple times now, the game seems to simply skip over a trigger (like deactivating a jammer), and then you're just stuck. And the game is so bad at actually linking your objectives to map points, you can't always be sure its a bug or something you didn't find yet. But contrast this lack of help on core objectives, with Riggs' near-constant reminders that ""you have a lot of alloy!"", when I have 4k and the Lv 5 gun I want costs 20k. Thanks Riggs. I'd recommend waiting to buy until these bugs are fixed, maybe you'll see it on sale while waiting.","Dec 29, 2019 at 3:19 AM",2, 6,

Without a doubt worth the money and a must for your VR library.  Fully recommended.

The one CON, and it's a big one, is the save sytem or lack of it.  I spent half a day getting to a certain point in the game but then had to leave it for RL.

2022-05-28 13:31:26.448822,AArevalo.01,Fun game,"07/07/2020: Update
Support finally answered, unfortunately they have been less than helpful. Uninstalling did not help. Finally found a forum with few people experiencing tons of bugs, one user had the same issue as I did. Thankfully her fix worked, had to lose days of game play (all that grinding) and start over again. This time before the end I saved the local save file. The game is amazing and tons of fun!!! Wish Support was better and the bugs were corrected.  

12/24/2019: Updating my review. Been over a week and still have not received assistance. Still unable to join the cycled games. The countdown on the board has rest after waiting over 6 days. Uninstalling did not help as the game placeses you back in the same bugged world. Looked help online with tons of people experiencing the same issues, and can not play. This game is amazing, but its just not ready. I recommend you wait for all the major bugs to be fixed. Or else like meny you to will get frustrated having purchased a game you cant play.

12/07/2019 PRO: This is game is a bit different from most . Environment and story (assisted play) are well done. The game is a bit short, if you do not spend time grinding and go straight for the goals. Good 6 hours of game time. 3 Days if you are like me and grind every map and island. 

CON: Once you complete the game what they call assisted game. YOu enter something called a cycle. Where you lose all your gear and upgrades. You have to start collecting it all over again. This time you will play some new areas that last a week and reorder the maps. Worst part is I cant play the game now. You enter and there is this big clock with a countdown starting with 6 days till cycle.  Can't believe I cant play a game I paid for. Well thinking it was a bug opened a ticket, just to receive a response that they might look at the ticket some time next year 2020.","Jan 8, 2020 at 3:03 PM",5, 7,

DEVELOPERS SUGGESTED UPDATES:

ENEMIES -They are still too dumb even at threat level 2!  They should be more conscious and aware of your presence!!!

Some don’t even shoot while you are shooting at others like you have to engage them to get them aware of you. 


ADD HIGHER THREAT LEVELS - like 5 to 10! 

ABILITY UPDATES - Would be great to be able to change your abilities within a cycle rather than wait til the next cycle! That way you can make mods to the robot as you go.

KEYS - It’s possible to insert the wrong key for a particular spire cell which causes the machine to not operate.  There’s no way to remove the keys!!!


Lastly, it’s a bit boring waiting for the next cycle!!!","Jan 28, 2020 at 11:48 AM",5, 1,

There seems no way to do this. It appears the developers made the game so that 1 player can play only one instance of the game. This is a huge oversight if it is true.

The fiddly grabbing mechanics makes it a frustrating experience to try and fully utilize your characters movement abilities in combat, as you constantly grab the terrain instead of your items, or vice versa.

The AI is really poor.

The HUD visor should consume energy, and be bound to a controller button instead of this silly ""tap your head"" gesture, that wears out it's intented novelty the second time you use it.

The peformance of this game is horrible.

2022-05-28 13:31:48.702950,Nikrey,"looks awesome, gets boring SUPER quick","My hopes for this game were so high. I wanted it to be one of the best VR games.
But if i really have to be honest, for 40 dollars its just a mediocre game.
Why?

Let me start with the good things:
The graphics are super good. 
This game is unbelievable well optimised.
Loading times are basically non existing (for comparison: asgards wrath had to load for like 1-2 minutes for me). 
Characters are looking great. 
UI's are really well translated into vr (for example, having a minimap on the back of one of your hands is a super cool idea.)
Weapons look cool, feel good and sound great.
The premise for the story is cool.


And now to why despite all this its just a mediocre game. 
The cons:
The story is SUPER short (your're probably through it after max 2 hours, probably faster) and is basically just used as a big tutorial.
There are basically just 4 standard enemy types all over the game which are super stupid and easy to kill and 1 bigger enemy type which is not that much harder to kill. So fighting is most of the time a no brainer and gets boring pretty quick. And there are no bosses.
After completing the story you get to the endgame which is basically just replaying that max 2 hour story over and over again in a slightly stretched out version.  it gets harder once a week if you completed the ""new story"" atleast once. 
what you're doing in the endgame will be basically replay 2 quests from the main story over and over again (scan islands and find keys to deactivate machines) because the main quests are those 2 quests on repeat. there are theoretically sidequests, but they are useless because there are basically no rewards.
there are no rewards because there is no real progression in this game. just a placebo version of it. 6 weapon types. each of them has lvl 1-5. getting lvl 5 is super easy. there are technically also perks but most of them are only quality of life improvements and since the enemys are SO easy to kill they feel like overkill.

The locomotion / traversal methods are great and my brain isn't sure how to process the sensation of flying / climbing / jumping some of these distances.

2022-05-28 13:31:48.739851,cactus22minus1,Disappointing Mechanics and Gameplay,"This was a day one purchase for me after having followed the hype leading up to release. The graphics and immersion are just as good as the trailers implied, which is fantastic. 

The disappointment for me set in once I got through the “tutorial” and started getting thrown into battle. So here’s my beef:

1.) Holstering Weapons. I can’t do this naturally without looking like any other shooter in VR. The guns are always glitching out and I have to look down in the heat of battle to make sure I’m not throwing my guns away. Worse yet, the guns are basically two handed and the trigger finger defaults to whichever hand grabs it first. So that gun in your left holster? Better awkwardly grab it with your right hand or you’ll be stuck firing it with your left finger. These issues alone just about ruin the game for me, but sadly it gets worse. 

2.) Ammo feels scarce. Perhaps some people enjoy having to constantly conserve ammo, but I’m not one of them. As far as I can tell, you can only get ammo by killing enemies and ripping apart their guns to get a few bullets or finding a “workbench” that I can only seem to find at the reset point after I’ve just died, and even then, you have to purchase the refill.

3.) Climbing with your hands is a cool idea, but the execution in this game is so bad. Especially if you’ve played Lone Echo, you know how this should work and feel, but sadly Stormland managed to make this extremely glitchy, inconsistent, and frustrating. Your hand won’t “grip” like half of the time, and the times they do, you can’t consistently fling yourself upward like you’re supposed to be able to do. When it works it’s actually really cool, but it fails so often that I’m left flinging my arms downward like an idiot over and over until I can get it to work. I’m not sure how they messed this up so bad. It’s flawless in a game like lone echo / echo combat. 

4.) You can’t control save points, and when you die (because you can’t find ammo anywhere) you get reset back incredibly far back onto some island and lose tons of progress or ground covered. This one was the final straw for me, because I don’t have hours and hours to play VR. Once I released how severe the setbacks were upon death, I realized I can’t even get into the game much at all. I can’t even get a refund at this point, but I wish I could.","Nov 25, 2019 at 11:17 PM",2, 5,

We stow our weapons on our hips. Good. That's great. The problem, is that any time you put your hands ANYWHERE NEAR your hips you get a CONSTANT vibration and hud notification about your ammo count. This makes putting your hands at your sides or anywhere near your sides virtually impossible as you get a constant stream of vibrations and flashing weapon icons in your hud. I can't play the game for 30 seconds without getting so frustrated that this made it past testing phases. The constant notification is so prevelant and annoying that it completely distracts from and drowns out any important haptic responses from the game.

F.e. flying is cool (for a couple of minutes), climbing is not really climbing (it's just clinging on from a distance), shooting mechanics are pretty standard, graphics are not as stunning as f.e. Asgards Wrath (but even the ol' Lone Echo seems better looking), the game is somewhat buggy and I don't really see that much innovation going on (so far). I'm thinking about refunding, cause in my view it's not worth 40 bucks (if its discounted later on and the game has been optimized and improved, I'll probably give it another go, but for now I'm a bit dissapointed (and I really wanted to like this game, especially since story-driven scifi is one of the reasons I like being immersed in VR... well, hopefully Lone Echo 2 will meet my (high) expectations...

This game looks and plays AMAZING.  I am running Ultra settings on a gtx 1070 and it just looks amazing!

Sadly, that's the only thing I like about the game.  I played for three hours and I guess the game itself is only 4 hours max, which is pretty shocking because I didn't really fight more than 3-5 times. 

This game starts off with a pretty long and boring tutorial with very minimal combat and after a few hours of it I just started to lose interest.  I finally quit when I got to a point where the game was directing me to a way point but I just could not figure out what I needed to do to progress the game.  I probably screwed around for about an hour until I finally gave up and decided to just move on to a new game.

The movement is great, easily the best part of the game, as you learn to grapple, double jump, and fly your way through the world. It begins to feel natural and is overall a joy. But the gunplay is where the gameplay falls apart. While dual wielding feels floaty and strange, the two handed modes on the guns are a major mixed bag. The shotgun immediately feels better, along with the minigun, while the sniper immediately becomes hellish to use. Because despite being a long range weapon, the scope does NOTHING. None of the scopes in this game are good at all. This is a huge oversight in a game where you engage across sometimes large distances. So while the game's world and navigation are great, (the story is passable i guess) the core gunplay feels inadequate for a game of its stature.

However, the addition of subs, no matter how badly implemented prevent me getting a refund. Instead what little I managed to get from it dramatically increased my enjoyment and I continue to enjoy this great little game.

BUGS:  the game is quite buggy. It also seems / feels like it was cut short because of the sale of the company. However there are a few show stoppers such as no elite enemies near the gate.

Other bugs less harmful like objects and collectables stuck in the ground are frequent but not as game-breaking as the above bug.  Ultimately the lack of content and bugs reduced a point, which I think most people would consider fair.

I have played it for almost 40 hours now, and the most annoying part of this is how it forces you to complete the game multiple times and it doesn't even get any harder. It forces you because you don't get the final ending until you do. And you have to wait 1 week each time for terminus to reset so you can't even complete it when you want to.

Buy or not?  Buy.

Note to Oculus staff:  please add a column for subtitles in the information area for your store. Steam does it. If you don't you will always incur a lot of ill-feeling toward your company from those of us who cannot lip read Darth Vader.","Dec 20, 2019 at 7:07 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 13:32:01.481231,StormyDoesVR,After a couple patches,"Ok, so this is my third time re-writing this review, now that I've finished the game, and after a couple of patches I'm going to bump it back up a star, since I appreciate how well Insomniac has received and responded to our feedback on this game!

There are a couple of things that still need adressed though.

The End Game is very, very underwhelming in it's current state. I've heard it said by some other players that the game's story is more like a very long tutorial to get you hyped for the end game, but the Cycling World (the name of the end game) is so lack luster that it's hardly worth the tutorial. Not to say that I still haven't jumped in almost every day to fight Tempest and collect materials... but that's about it. sure, bosses may get a tiny bit harder, but no new enemies show up, the world never gets more dense or filled with more things to do, and the voice lines from the friendly Android crew gets so repetitive so quickly that I honestly have thought about turning voices off entirely sometimes. Nyx's adorable voice is the only thing keeping me from doing so.

Enemies in genreal are just too easy to defeat, and there are so few of them scattered across  the tiny islands of the game that I feel like I'm way too overpowered by the end of the game. the enemy numbers should be waaaaaaay beefed up. Especially with some of the latter arm upgrades even high tier enemies stand no chance.

I'd also love to see more power-ups for the arms. There's a boatload of space in the workbench for other arm attachments, yet I've only seen a couple so far, and most of them (one arm aside) feel pretty similar. I'd love to see the arms utilized more, especially since switching arms was a key part of the original trailers for the game. (I'm thinking a Deus Ex style carbon nano-bar firing arm would be an excellent addition, and could really divvy up gameplay, among other attachments)

This game is pretty incredible! While it is a little rough around the edges (little bugs here and there, controls can sometimes be a bit quirky with specific functions), the core gameplay itself is tons of fun. The best mechanic is how easily and freely you can move around--hovering, climbing, gliding, slipstream mechanics are amazing. The best part is that this movement ties strongly into gameplay; moving around intelligently can get you a strong tactical advantage in fights. Even slipstreaming onto the right part of a stronghold can get you a good leg up when attempting that content. The fact that you can improve and change so much with your locomotion too over time is incredible, too.

As of now, the game is pretty easy--the campaign/tutorial was probably harder than the final area of the first full cycle. I assume future cycles will change and improve this over time, given dev commentary on the game.

2022-05-28 13:32:07.816020,ShocksVR,Next Gen Traversal w/Repetitive Gameplay,"Insomniac's latest and probably final Oculus title (since they were recently acquired by SONY), took me 22 hours to go through the campaign (7 hrs) and 2 cycles of terminus (escalation level 2).  Going through the cycled world a 3rd time grants you the secret alternate ending (which I haven't done yet and will probably add another 3-4 hrs). Thus, Stormland easily delivers 20+ hours of gameplay.

Stormland has amazing next generation traversal mechanics (flying, slipstreaming, climbing, gliding). Playing using the traversal mechanics alone can be addicting; combine it with exploring islands (the environments look amazing!!), mining alloy, harvesting fruit, and finding hidden collectables, and you have your own mini-game within Stormland.

Combat: the gunplay is average at best. The guns are very cool to look at and fun to use, but the gun upgrades only grant additional ammo capacity (and slightly higher dmg), and the enemy AI isn't the best/smart enough to fight against.  In the end, combat ends up becoming an easy chore when combined with character skill unlocks.

When Stormland was premiered at E3 2018, Oculus promised us a title with deep gameplay and next-generation mechanics.  Stormland does deliever on the next gen mechanics, but it falls short on the deep gameplay we all had hoped for.  If the campaign was longer (10+ hrs), then I think it would have been better received.  

Overall, Stormland features shallow repetitive gameplay, but the 'literally amazing' traversal mechanics help mitigate it's shortcomings. Stormland is still a worthy title that will deliver 20+ hrs of fun.","Nov 28, 2019 at 6:41 PM",4, 9,

2022-05-28 13:32:10.968706,HandsomeP00P,First Hour(ish) of Gameplay impression,"So I wrote out waaaaaaay too much not realizing there's a limit on how many words I can type SOOOOOO I'll leave it to this: 

Movement: 10/10, climbing, gliding, incredibly fast sprinting, and the slipstream system (basically just gliding around at mach 7 using your arms to steer), all add make for a super smooth and intuitive movement system.

Gunplay: Kinda lackluster weaponry so far (I have unlocked an SMG, shotgun, and Carbine rifle) HOWEVER the mechanics behind them are phenomenal. You can hold a gun with one hand for a basic shot, or hold it with two for a cool animation that makes your gun look extra pretty and get some upgrades (SMG gets more accurate and faster fire rate, shotgun does a good deal more damage, and Rifle gets a neat lil scope and bonus damage). There is no reloading, when you're out of ammo you strip the weapon for parts and find another one.

Story: Amazing so far. Starts super mysterious, and the atmosphere is very impressive. Characters all actually feel real and in depth, voice acting is phenomenal, and character progression actually feels fleshed out. The upgrade system is simply collect resources by smashing boxes and ore deposits, then spend them on better guns, or fabricating items to use. You can also smash plants and stuff later to upgrade your flower heart (its a thing) to make your android do more cool stuff, like turning scrapped weapons into grenades, double jump, better shield, etc. I also love that you can rip your arm off and replace it with a better one. Just sayin'.

All in all, it's amazing, and my review really can't do it justice. The weapons feel a little sluggish but it has amazing exploration, character progression, and atmosphere to boot. For $40, buy it, buy it now. You'll thank me later. Or not. Just make sure to thank yourself ;)","Dec 15, 2019 at 10:23 AM",5, 0,

now for my rant.....

i want to love this game. i really do. it's beatiful. the controls are intuitive and smooth. weapons are great..... but in it's current state i cannot. spend 10k in the workbench to lose everything after i travel to another world. die in mp after spending loads of money on upgraded weapons only for it to reset and be gone to where you have to buy it all again, because someone thought it was a good idea to not allow your game to save in mp (yes i am aware it tells you this). doesn't change the fact. this game is boring solo. surely everyone has at least 1 friend they can play with. if not that's cool it has matchmaking. the game is designed for mp/coop, but yet it's absolutely pointless to buy anything because you dont get to keep it. it forces you to make people join your game or play solo so you can keep your stuff. just cannot wrap my head around that logic. hopefully more patches/updates are coming SOON because again i really want to love this game. it's so close.","Nov 20, 2019 at 10:12 AM",3, 3,

2022-05-28 13:32:11.026551,jjGuardian,Excellent VR game And experience,"I love the freedom and exploration aspects of the game.Rather than rushing to complete the 6 hour story line, I can take my time, explore the virtual world and experiement with combat tactics. The game also makes use of arm gestures for movment and gliding so time to warm up those shoulder muscles!
In the ""What could be better"" category, I aquired 150,000 alloy with my level 5 SMGs. There simply isn't enough to use my alloy on. Same for Aeon buds. I have 18 and nothing to spend them on. The upgrades focus on growth and THATS hard to come by..
I like the sniper style of play and had to abandon the sniper rifle because the sights are garbage. They simply don't magnify enough. The punch of the sniper rifle is good but with a crap ammo load I can't afford to take it on missions.

The game has some oddities and some nasty bugs. In the oddity category, you're climbing along nicely and suddenly your grapple isn't working anymore. They'll occasionally alter the laws of their virtual reality to force you to approach a situation ""their way"": instead of your way. Game designer in a rush.
The bugs are everythere. Robot you kill will keep talking. You can get stuck listening to some really annoying sounds throughout your play because you were near something that made an annoying sound when the sound bug decided to hit you. I've listened to drones buzzing or the blast of jet engines for hours well after their gone..
Canisters and stuctures that are supposed to blow up when hit sometimes simply won't and yesterday I tried to start the portal to Terminus only to find no portal controls.I had to restart the game. Like magic canisters could explode and the portal controls appeared. Sadly, all the robots I had killed had respawned.

Drones are cool when they work but pathing is broke so you lose them on ledges or just walking. I had one with me on a fight who couldn't engage cause the drone was on my right and the fight was beyond the left edge of a wall. Useless!

While there are still some slight glitches here and there, the game is overall awesome and it is very nice that the developers fixed several bugs i reported within less than a week and the game is much less buggy and even much nicer now, very cool. Had no major glitch in several hours of playing since the latest update.
Some of the main nice sides:
-beautiful scenery
-some of the best traversal/interaction,  surpassing what one can do in most interactive content, one stepwise gets a pretty amazing move/action set. Climb most surfaces is just one of them. Imagine you climb up close to the top of a  structure, lean over the surface edge with your head while holding onto the wall with one hand and aim the weapon at an enemy with the other hand, it is pretty cool. 
One also gets gliding  and ""surfing"" skills on the surfaces connecting islands and can combine those to accelerate and catapult oneself massively into the air high up at tall structures and then climb onwards there.
It makes one feel like ironman, super man and  spiderman, totally natural that one can move and get up pretty much anywhere.

If you're playing sitting it's still decent but please play standing or roomscale it's soooo much better. Personally I don't have the space to play roomscale or standing in my room due to a tilted celing and limited space, but playing with ALVR and wirelessly is decent except for the input lag

2022-05-28 13:32:23.696599,JingleJosh,Brilliant gameplay and actual content!,"I'm having an absolute blast playing through this game! It's so much fun to speed through the fantastic environments insomniac has provided us with. The design principles used in Stormlands are amazing as the game hardly ever pulls you out of your immersion and never making you perform a ""non-diagetic"" action once!
the platforming is fantastic and exploring the world is an absolute delight!

However, the stealth in the game and the difficulty, in general, is too easy. I think stealth isn't as rewarding as it could be and direct conflict is simply the best route to take almost every time. Nothing is truly dangerous to the player and dying has little consequence.

Maybe make alarms go off which keeps summoning enemies or just increase the enemy's damage in general. 
There should be an actual reason to take the time to stealth through an entire camp. A special loot, not fighting wave after wave of enemies, or just some extra currency and a checkmark on the map.
Another difficulty option I would also like is only enabling the aiming lasers in the visor. Playing with the visor on seems like easy mode. I can opt-out of using the visor if I don't want to. But the aiming lasers should also be optional.

 
Don't get me wrong, the current gameplay loop of running into a camp and shredding everyone in it with some fancy gunplay and clever platforming is satisfying as hell. But the stealth seems annoyingly tacked on. 
The game could lean to one style of gameplay or the other but lacks focus and is overall weaker for it.","Nov 27, 2019 at 7:07 PM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 13:32:23.715548,Sn1percat,"Amazing shooter, but exclusivity sucks","GOOD
Graphics- pretty amazing especially for vr with high detail and cool effects 
Gun play- overall really smooth and the ability to 2hand a gun to improve accuracy or alter its function is cool, mix this in with an energy shield on your hand along with over neat toys and it leaves you with a bucket of combat options.
Story- is decent, but it feels like more of the setup for the endgame loop
Movement- from skating across the clouds, to scaling mountains and flying the movement feels slick and well-polished and ties into the combat to allow you to approach the fight any way you want.
Longevity- a 5-6 hour main story sound short but the endgame content is a great loop with lots of collecting and crafting to upgrade weapon’s and you’re robot.
BAD
Sniper rifle- no reticule when scoped so you don’t know what you are hitting making the weapon useless (pls fix XD).
AI- the enemy ai is pretty brain dead, a lot of the time I have killed one close range with a shotgun and his buddy next to him has no idea I was there lol.
Exclusivity – one of the selling points is co-op which sounds amazing and would allow for so much more fun and longevity but exclusivity means that you cannot really play this with non-oculus users which sucks as many of my mates have htcs or index’s , exclusivity sucked with the console wars and it hurts even more now as VR does not have the player base to make this work and it also means less people will buy this game as otherwise I would say this is a must own for VR gamers","Dec 4, 2019 at 1:14 AM",4, 1,

I've spent 8 hours with stormland so far, and everytime I throw on the headset and boot up stormland I am never dissapointed. The game itself looks incredible, all of the guns are so fun to use and all unique in there own ways. I love how there's a different weapon for each senerio, and every fight requires a different approach. For example some fights may be the best executed with a more stealthy approach and some may be best fought going in guns blazing, the possibilities are seemingly endless. The story in Stormland actually seems belivable and you can tell that serious thought was put in it and not just thrown together in a few days like some VR titles seem to be. Messing around with your friend is stormland is the best game to do so in. We always can think of new ways to liberate outposts and find new things to explore. Although the endgame can be a little repetitive on it's own, hopping online with your friend is the best feeling in VR. Seeing them next to you as you glide across the clouds, is so rewarding.  
So in conclusion Stormland is, in my opinion, the best vr experience so far, and well worth the money.","Nov 26, 2019 at 12:35 PM",5, 3,

PROS
Graphics are top notch and super immersive.
COOP is extremely fun, while still keeping great story.
Locomotion system is amazing, first VR game I feel truly captures spirit of Open World Games.
Combat is fast paced and rewarding, while still allowing for exploration and challenge, this aspect is really well balanced.
Breaking apart guns and canisters was a great idea for a VR mechanic.

FEEDBACK
The head scanner is a bit overpowered IMO, since you can leave it on permanently and can see where every enemy is, I leave it off to get more of a challenge and more excitment from stumbling upon enemies.  I think if the scanner was switched to some type of a temporary pulse with a cool down, or perhaps a deployable drone (like Ghost Recon Wildlands / Breakpoint) would make that aspect of the game more fun.

4 Player Coop would be incredible.

I think more of a punishment for death would help with the balance, right now there isn't really too much to fear from dying.

We bought two copies so we could play together but also want to play solo if someone else isn't around. For this reason you should be able to have two saves, one for solo and one for co-op. We also want to allow both boys to play on the same rift at different times while playing their own story and objectives. This is a basic function that should not have been left out.

2022-05-28 13:32:33.282257,rawdmon,"Great game, few issues that need fixing","This is a great game.  It's clear that this was designed from the ground up with VR in mind.  The interactivity is very well done.  Especially small details like grabbing and tearing apart enemy guns with both hands to recover material and ammo from them.  Once you're all decked out with all your gear / modules you really have an ironman type feeling while playing, it's fantastic.  The only things keeping me from giving this game 5 stars are: 1. It lacks multiple save slots.  This is 2019, how are game developers still making this mistake?  Most households only have 1 VR headset.  It's conceivable that multiple people are going to want to play the same VR game on the same computer.  You should offer at least 4 individual save slots.  2. The arm animations are not great.  The hand movement is nice and smooth but then you look over at the arms and often times they are jittering all over the place.  It's very immersion breaking.  I looked for an option to turn off the arm rendering and just have the hands like you can do in many other VR titles but alas there is no such option.  Either fix the arm animations to smooth them out (I've seen other games do this much better) or add the option to turn off the rendering of your body and only render the hands.  3. Get rid of the controller rumble and display of ammo summary when putting your hands on your sides where you guns are.  It's annoying resting your hands there (which is the natural place to have hands at rest while walking) and having that constant intermittent buzzing and ammo displays coming and going.  It's very immersion breaking and not useful at all.  If I want to know how much ammo my guns have I just have to grab them and look.  I also don't need controller vibration to tell me when my hands are over them, I know exactly where they are.  An option to turn both those things off would be fantastic.  Other than those 3 annoyances this is a great game and easily in my top 3 list for VR (out of the 30+ I've tried)","Nov 26, 2019 at 2:38 AM",4, 2,

Climb walls, jump and glide, wield multiple weapons, craft, and more. You can get a bit motion sick the first day but your body gets used to it. Completely worth the money.

2022-05-28 13:32:36.404536,bocajeff,Amazing game,"What a great looking and feeling game. I mean, if I have a choice of playing this game or watching the Dolphins when they're down by 21, it's no contest. Reading some of the reviews, some folks had issues but I found a way around them. The thing I love about this game is the strategy - if you're smart with your resources you can really get stuff done. And the game allows you to do that - find a bunch of enemies, get some intel on their location/numbers, and you can do whatever you want to shoot them down. Personally, I love the sniper position. I get good medium-long range rifles and shoot them from a high position. If you don't get the red dot on the target, try switching eyes. Careful with which guns you have holstered before you leave an area - sometimes the game switches guns by accident. In a battle, you're moving quickly and the game can throw a gun down instead of holstering it, and then if you die, you lose that gun because it wasn't holstered when you died. That also happens when you quit the game. 

The game has a steep learning curve too. It doesn't explain everything to you, and it's up to you to figure some things out. So if you're frustrated, just keep going at your own pace. You'll get it. 

PROS: Wide open world, wide open freedom of movement, strategy. Shooting is cool too. Amazing graphics, sailing around is a great experience and feels great. 

CONS: AI is a bit weak. After getting through the first major task, I thought they would be a bit smarter but they're not. Also, the game sometimes switches guns on you when you didn't mean to, and you can lose guns you don't want to lose. Also, when you exit the game if you're holding a gun, you lose that gun when the game restarts. Kind of a bummer and it makes me keep the game active all the time.","Nov 25, 2019 at 3:00 AM",5, 2,

I've been playing for 3 hours straight now exploring everywhere. eel like ive barely scratched the surface (I just picked up my multiplayer antenna and the next part, no spoilers). It's visually stunning, polished as Asguards Wrath, plays on Ultra settings for me and my PC is just an AMD 2600x with an Rx480 8gb card and 8gb of ddr 4 ram. The loading scenes you dont even notice as its part of traveling to locations. 100% BUY IT! - Between this and Asguards Wrath, I cant see myself playing another VR game for awhile lol (except vorpx when i'm lazy and wanna play PC games in 3d vr with a controller on the couch haha). My only complaint so far would be - I would prefure to be able to pick up ammo for my guns rather then constantly picking up guns. Maybe that is possible? but so far If I run out of ammo I gotta pick up another gun. It's no big deal, I just like reloading :) - But hey, flying, super jumping, cl;imbing, surfing, its incredible!! Thank you so much devs for such an awesome game!!!!!!!!! P.s. to the person who said there was no story or shallow story, wtf are you playing???

2022-05-28 13:32:39.587589,VRBladeCast,EPIC!,"Now that the 9kb error is fixed, I'm still very impressed with the size of download! Compared with Asgard's Wrath, this is a fraction of the size and yet the world design and graphics feel detailed... and it runs very smoothly.  I turned off acceleration (set max speed to instant and smooth turn speed to instant), and I'm not experiencing motion sickness.

I'm only about an hour in, but I'm liking the interaction mechanics; this is what VR should be!

So, unfortunately I need to sleep for work tomorrow, but I cant wait to come back to the Stormland and discover more... 

From other people's reviews, I am led to believe that there isn't a huge amount of substance to the single player game... will there be a modding scene/capability for this game?  I hope so, as the vanilla experience is fantastic, but if the game could grow through enthusiastic modding, now that WOULD be something!

I wholeheartedly retract my review at (non)release: this game is EPIC.  Good job Insomniac!

PS. I understand 1 star for it not installing earlier, and Im sure those reviews will get changed once the people get to actually play it, but 1 star cos it wont work in Revive?! That's not Oculus/Insomniac's fault?! It's pretty much the same as buying a game for PS4 and complaining it doesnt work on XBox?!","Nov 15, 2019 at 7:51 AM",5, 6,

I also lost progress from that save, I had just unlocked the power for your wrist gun to generate lift off the clouds, and when I relaunched, I was only just putting the charge blast on my left arm, and it was asking me to use it on the two generators which were already powered up since I had progressed past that.

2022-05-28 13:32:42.781670,Sombra84,Seasoned VR Gamer - Real Review,"Intro: I'm a VR Dev and also a VR fanatic since the early days of VR.  I am not one to pretend the technology is not still in development, we have a far way to come, that being said -- some amazing things are happening.

Stormland - The Good:
The game has an outstanding feel to it.  Everything from the speedy racing through the Stormland with a very fluid and fun movement system and climbing system to the combat mechanics. I will spare the long review but I will say the inventory and menu system is very well done and I honestly have not experienced anything this good since ""Lone Echo"".

Combat also feels rather good, albeit not perfect.  Gun selections and upgrade including the ability upgrade tree for your character are all well played out and actually a first for VR -- most VR games do not even touch on character progression.

Story - Reasonable length, well narrated and well played out.  It leaves enough to question as to where you wish to proceed but it's not so much that it is boring.  The ""ending"" is not really an ending as you begin another ongoing adventure.  Stormland seemingly aims to bring an evolving world (MMO style) into VR.  There are other features which allow multiplayer aspects although I have not fully explored them.  In a sense that element and the world almost reminds me of ""Destiny 2"" style in terms of online play.

The Bad - Stormland:
There are few bad things to say.  I will mention that the controls are ocasionally glitchy and throughout the ""main campaign"" I had maybe 2 or 3 moments where I was annoyed because of a quick control glitch.  It was nothing serious but it's a factor.  In addition, the input sometimes seems ""laggy"", your arms or hands are just a few milliseconds behind in the game and you can notice it, only breifly.  

Combat does feel great however at times it almost feels flat or clunky.  Overall these cons are minor and I highly recommend this game to FPS fans and adventure fans alike.","Nov 21, 2019 at 5:21 PM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 13:32:42.822560,Sp0rky,How to fix pre-ordered but no download,"If your game says 'Pre-ordered' but there is no download option available: I was able to do this and it is now downloading for me: 

1. Go to Oculus Support Website and Log in. 
2. Go to Your Orders and find Stormland Order
3. IF IT STATES THAT THE PREORDER FAILED: Cancel the pre-order on Stormland.
4. Restart your Oculus App 
5. Go to Oculus Store on App, you will see that its available again to buy. 
6. Buy like normal 
7. Proceed to download.

EDIT: I don't know if this method works for those who actually had their pre-order charged, or if it cancels the pre-order exclusives.  If you just want to play the game and it states 'Pre-Order failed' on Oculus Support orders, the above will work.","Nov 15, 2019 at 1:57 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 13:32:45.964281,Moike,"Solid UI, great story, beautiful worlds","First things first, the user interface and interaction system is dialed in and one of the nicer I've used in a VR title that didn't feel like it was flat-panel best practices cobbled into a VR interface.

The HUD is one of the best I've seen, all important information is just in the perephry of your vision, and the ability to enable/disable it with a fingertap to temple gesture is a good use of VR UI as opposed to a button binding.

The worlds are beatufully detailed, and if you like exploring and finding hidden items there is a lot to do.  The climing mechanic takes a minute to get used to, but once you become accustomed to it you can easily scale most obstacles with a single hand.

There are only a few things I need in a VR experience to have a good time, tell me a story, present me with characters I can become emotionally invested in, give me beatiful worlds to explore, and present me with challenges.  Stormland does all this well.","Nov 22, 2019 at 3:46 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 13:32:45.985225,CarloFromMilkyWay,,"In my previous review I complained about the shortness of the game and gave it three stars.  After playing more with Stormland I realized that this title deserves 5 stars (maybe more).  Is it a perfect AAA game?  No. I still regret that the developers have not devoted more resources to expand the story and add scenarios.  And I'm disappointed that Insomniac Games will now work exclusively for Sony and won't even be able to update the contents, perhaps releasing new DLCs.  BUT: the graphics are fantastic.  The worlds are rich in details, vegetation, different and varied textures.  The game mechanics exploit VR in a sublime way.  Every gesture is fluid and natural.  Even the most magical actions can be performed naturally.  The content is sufficiently mixed and not boring.  In practice, the elements that constitute Stormland are repeated and are not so many, taken individually.  But they are used wisely in order to prolong interest and challenge.  Enemies gradually become more intelligent and difficult to destroy.  The various islands slightly change, always with new small details that make them interesting to explore.  For now, this game is the best that VR can offer, along with Asgard's Wrath which is superior in variety and complexity.  Since the genre is the same, I want to mention here Seeking Dawn.  It was less publicized, less engaging but another good title of the same kind.  I gave him 5 stars some time ago.  Stormland therefore deserves 6 and Asgard's Wrath 7.","Nov 21, 2019 at 4:05 PM",5, 1,

A beautiful story with interesting characters and a well developed world with game mechanics that keep me entertained for hours. If anyone wants a nostalgic story where you can beat some robots and save your world; this is the game for you.

2022-05-28 13:32:55.513154,Masamune5454,This is a must own.,"Theres alot of vr games nowadays. the problem is most are short on content, or short on campaign, or short on mechanics. While yes, there is some limitations and shortcomings here, its easily one of the best games out right now. I think everyone knows about the crazy mobility and lots of replayabiltiy, and hopefully they do good on the weekly reset content. i for one hope they add more weapons and abilitys. more ways to kill the bad guys. Its super fun to fly across and drop grenades on their head, or climbing and flinging yourself behind a enemy and rip out his health tank.

There are some things i dont understand , one being the lack of melee weapons or augments and AI can be dumb sometimes. Also i wish the crafting system was deeper than just one or two resources, may
be in the future they can flesh this out. 
The guns are awsome, but as some say they could improve the haptics and feel. i like the tranforming guns, and they make sense, but it would be nice to have a manual reload option, but i can see that it would be out of place maybe.

In my opinion the game is to easy and coop would make it even more boring. Repeating the same thing over and over as long as the fights are swarmed with enemies and needing a buddy to help would be wonderful but that  is not the case. The game finally gets to be a challenge around the last level and still not high enough for me. I want to be able to increase the diffuculty so the game is fun from the begining and hard as nails at the end. The big issue is the game from what I have read is done what you buy is what it will be forever that is a shame just a few tweaks and this could be the game I was looking for.  I would never refund it as I do have fun just want more.
Edit: I am aware it will get harder after finishing however I would like to choose the starting difficulty.

Edit: On the last part for this cycle and I am killing lvl 5 enemies with lvl 4 guns easy. I don't upgrade my character anymore  because then I will be so over powered.

Honestly after the release of ""Asgards Wrath"" I'm really struggling to accept how sloppy everyone are on their texture design. I always thought that it was the hardware restricting better visual but Asgards Wrath proved me wrong!  Shame on you majority of VR developers!

I'll continue playing this game at some point in half a year or years time, but after approximately 1 hour of gameplay this game is so far down my list.

Too boring early on.  Wall climbing is tedious.  Comfort level is not good when flying.  On positive side, very immersive.","Nov 24, 2019 at 5:03 AM",3, 2,

Me and a friend pre-ordered this with extremely high hopes and we were not disappointed. Other than the couple of quest glitches we encountered because we were playing co-op (but, nothing a patch can't do) this game is a must have and I would recommend it to anyone.","Nov 17, 2019 at 1:56 AM",5, 1,

After finally being able to experience it, it's even more than I'd hoped for!  This is a very polished game with jaw-dropping graphics, great optimization (I'm running a GTX 1080 Ti with a Core i7-6700K with a mix of Ultra and High settings and it's smooth as glass with no noticeable ASW), incredible and satisfying gameplay, and an immersion factor that is just jaw dropping.  The complete freedom of movement in this game is something that must be experienced to understand... it's absolutely amazing!  This is the new bar for immersive VR and should NOT be passed up!  Thanks for delivering on all accounts, Insomniac and Oculus Studios!  What a masterpiece!","Nov 16, 2019 at 12:26 AM",5, 1,

Many guns, upgrades and a kewl story. And everytime I see the friendly bots, I think Johnny 5 :). Good nastalgia :)

The NPC’s are lovable, the gameplay is solid, and going around an just exploring the world is just so fascinating. Honestly I thought I would be able to step away from the game after reaching the end, but all I want to do is keep collecting alloy and blasting off the heads of baddies one shot gun blast at a time.

I just love running around slipstreaming the clouds and exploring the islands. I feel like ill be getting 20 hours minimum out of this title. I think over time the islands could be stale and them changing doesnt seem like it will make much of a difference but im excited to have reasons to come back at least a couple times a week. anyways i think gunplay is decent enough tho a bit weaker then expected and the lore and characters are so much more fleshed out then i expected. definitely get stormland,"Nov 16, 2019 at 4:41 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 13:33:05.109337,giggie123,👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,"More or less all you need to know about this game is that it’s fun and is very replayable. The game has a interesting story with good characters. The game really shines in the environments, the environments can come from wet swamps, cluttered forests and spires taller than skyscrapers. The provision feels satisfying and meaning full with intuitive display and functionality. I didn’t get motion sick the entire time that I played but for someone who’s knew to vr this might be much. In conclusion, the game is fun and smart with its systems and how it dose things. It’s slick and fun with a tint of that insomniac goodness.","Nov 15, 2019 at 11:21 AM",5, 1,

Though it may not have an incredible amount of depth in any given direction, the in-game systems are exactly what they should be, slipstreaming/parkouring feels fantastic and free, and it comes together to make exploration is a blast. Combat is on the weak side, but not in a way that hinders the overall experience.","Nov 15, 2019 at 6:14 PM",5, 3,

I could't find an option to disable vibration anywhere either. Its a shame.

But still want to give it a try. Played about 10 minutes, have to stop and lay down for a while because the motion sickness. Hope there's a teleport option I can choose to move around. I mean no matter how awesome the content is, it won't matters if player get sick. 4 star to support of the creativity and hardwork. (Just tried another 20 minutes, lot of fun, but still too much motion sickness, I really hope this game have a teleport movement method )","Nov 15, 2019 at 1:31 PM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 13:33:11.440659,Milamber18,,"Just finished the main story line.  Outstanding AAA game!  

The graphic artists should get a pay raise.  The environment is very immersive.  Everything from the art to the sound is right on point!

Gameplay is addictive and fun and there is enough content to keep you busy well past the relatively short story line.  You can rush through it if you want, but taking your time and exploring the environment is definitely worth it and extends your playtime by quite a bit.

The game was designed with VR in mind.  Interacting with the environment feels completely natural.  Most of the world is manipulated and interacted with by using your hands.  Anywhere a menu is involved is very well integrated and, again, is manipulated with your hands rather than your controller toggle.  Well done there.

Once the storyline is done, the whole game shuffles around weekly to give a large replayability factor. 

I've experienced very few glitches/bugs.  Fell inside a mountain and couldn't get back out and there have been a few times an elevator button glitched out and wouldn't work.  Also, at the end of the main story line, a door that was supposed to unlock didn't.  But a reload  sorted things out with very little loss in progress.
If Insomniac address some of these minor glitches in their first post-release patch, the game will be dang near perfect in my opinion.

All in all, one of the best games in my very extensive VR library.  If i could give it more stars, I would.","Nov 18, 2019 at 1:20 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 13:33:11.461602,DasHxL,A great game all around,"This game is what I've been waiting for. The UI is simple and the concept is easy to grasp. I love the customization so far, flying from island to island feels really smooth and liberating. Haven't tried MP yet but I am sure it will add so much more to the game. I do wish there were more enemies but maybe thats just because im in the early stages of the game. I can't wait to see how the map changes on a week to week basis.","Nov 16, 2019 at 4:37 AM",5, 0,

Getting around the world is seamless and, more importantly, fun. My computer is somewhat modest and the game runs really well.

2022-05-28 13:33:14.596340,nerdonthecouch,Non-functional,"UPDATE/ Now that the install issues have fallen to the wayside, all seems to be in order. Everything that was promised is here, and then some. Traversal is some of the best I've ever seen in VR. Climbing occasionally has some invisible walls, which aren't super well telegraphed, but that's not a deal breaker in the least. Gliding especially feels good, and combat is interesting so far. The versatility of weaponry is so so, so far. It's nice that each weapon has a different functionality when used with two hands, although the differences can be minimal depending on the weapon. One of the few downsides is weapon handling. Weapons can feel a bit floaty, and it lacks the snappiness of an Arizona Sunshine, for instance. This extends to interacting with certain objects as well. The containers that you open for gear have various tactile mechanisms used to open them, but it sometimes doesn’t feel like it's responding accurately. All in all, if these little things are the worst I have to say about the game, and you were already considering getting it, I think you can feel confident in that decision.


PREVIOUS COMENTS/ As of right now, this game is 9kb of non-functional data. Saw this when I preordered and figured it was a bug on the oculus store. My mistake in putting any trust in a VR game, I guess. I'll be updating this review when they fix it, but kind of a crappy oversight.","Nov 16, 2019 at 8:31 AM",4, 0,
