2022-05-28 18:36:22.530152,Pizzle91,I wouldn’t recommend,I purchased this Friday night(05/08/20) and tried to play it.  It continuously glitches won’t open doors etc. I feel it could be a fun game if it would work properly. I messaged about getting it fixed or a refund and havent heard anything back...,"May 11, 2020 at 10:29 PM",1, 8,
2022-05-28 18:36:22.545112,OversizeWizard,Creepy but didn't work properly,"This started up, walked into room with a desk and I couldn't turn around right.  Would click left fine, but would stick turning right same spot. 
This happened randomly.
When I click to run, it seems to carry on running when I leave go of stick for about 4-5 seconds, or if I click the stick in again..

Went to options to set movement and camera to sift turn. Back to game, went to turn right where it was stuck and the screen went black and stayed like that.

Got about 5 mins play.


Really wanted to play this, seemed really creepy.but like this it's totally unplayable unfortunately.

Refunding now as I don't was to miss the refund policy by trying it again and same thing happens and I'm stuck with a game I can't use at all.","Mar 15, 2020 at 12:40 AM",3, 1,"The issue reported is very strange.
We have thoroughly tested the latest update even after your report and there are no problems in the movement and rotation control system.
Running question: it’s normal that you are not be able to run indefinitely because in the game there is a level of stamina that once exhausted no longer allows you to run for a few seconds."
2022-05-28 18:36:22.560072,DisplayVRC,creepy,"Great graphics
scary baby's
Keys are not hard to find
But when i shine my UV light upon them they still can kill me?
And after i got killed my game crashes with ""fatal error""
still i do recommend this game if u like creepy horror games.
Just hope they will fix the few bugs in the game.

Update : Seems the fatal error is fixed and the babys are now scared of the UV light. This game just got even better. Now all the bugs are gone i think its time to try it. worth it.","Nov 4, 2019 at 3:32 AM",5, 17,
2022-05-28 18:36:22.578025,Maxtrooper,so creepy,"Great atmosphere, great game it makes me feel very scary. No motion sickness at all for me.  Everything is so dark I turn around every second for scary sounds behind me. Nice job!!","Dec 12, 2019 at 7:58 PM",5, 3,"Thanks so much!!
We report you that we've introduced in the last update 1.1 the hands model to grab and interact with objects and doors."
2022-05-28 18:36:22.597972,ParadiseDecay,Nice UV light mechanic!,"My Initial Impressions:
A great atmospheric horror with standard/typical themes and locations and an interesting horror mechanic, the ability to use UV light to scare off the monsters.
Graphics are great and realistic and this was yet another VR horror game to give me goosebumps on many occasions.

2022-05-28 18:36:25.707654,1_Mercure_1,Get sick with teleport !,"why the teleport movement move the room ?! 
Most of the time, when I move (teleport) the room is tilted ?
Impossible to play! Can you quickly fix it ?
Oculus CV1 , calibration ok , this is the only game which have this problem.

EDIT : The problem stay even on another computer and with another Oculus CV1 : When you move (teleport) the walls is leaning (all the room is leaning on a side so the floor himself is leaning) then when you move again with teleport the walls is leaning to the opposite side (and all the room is leaning on the opposite side) . Do someone else use the teleport movement ? This problem is random but very frequent : In the first room, the problem appear. Impossible to play it, I'm asking a refund.","Oct 10, 2019 at 8:11 PM",1, 1,"We tested the game for a long time with the teleport after your report and we don't have these problems and no other reported anything like this.
You can try the new version 1.07 available on the store, we have reduced the transition time to teleport. Let us know if you solve the problem, contact us at pr@blackbite-interactive.com."
2022-05-28 18:36:25.722613,movement1957,No stars,"No hands, no side movement, no explanation of anything.  Just grab key and batteries and pretty graphics but everything else is broken.  Stay away!","Sep 22, 2019 at 12:48 AM",1, 8,"***HANDS MODEL AND PHYSIC INTERACTION INTRODUCED IN THE NEW VERSION 1.1 AVAILABLE ON THE STORE***
We are sorry that your game experience was not satisfactory to your standards, but why you say ""everything else is broken""?
The game was strongly tested before the launch and it passed several and hard tests before launching. We don't have any reports about these problems.

Maybe you had ended too early the game because you didn't activate the UV-mode with grip-button on motion controller as indicated on the board near the desk where you grab the flashlight. With UV-mode ON you can scare away the crawling creatures that live in the darkness.

Anyway, it's online the new version 1.02:
* Ability to strafe
* More detailed tutorial

If you want to, play again!!
Thanks"
