2022-05-28 16:01:19.908756,Themo_,Really cool game!!,"I own pretty much every interesting title available for rift and quest, but this is the first time I write a review . This game is super fun, very polished and highly addictive (once you get the hang of it). Just one minor suggestion that would propably not be too much of an effort to add to the game and would make it perfect for me... if there was a SWOOOOSH sound when swinging the swords/weapons, it would make it even more awesome. Other than that, really great work! Thank you flipcoin people for developing this! I will continue to voiceact the SWOOSHES myself until you add them.","Aug 15, 2019 at 7:22 AM",5, 23,

2022-05-28 16:01:23.081270,rlpowell,My Favorite Workout Game?,"Really gets me moving!  Note that you can *dodge* enemy attacks by moving backwards quickly when the hit animation starts; I find this easier than blocking a lot of the time, and it's more movement, which I love.","Aug 11, 2019 at 8:23 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 16:01:23.096230,RuneSR2,Non-Fruit Ninja ;-),"Low poly game, looks like something for the Quest, low-res textures, no free locomotion, but a fun game much like Fruit Ninja. Probably would be better for $10. Nice performance, but then again this is low-end graphics. Sound is nice and controls work flawlessly. You can enable blood, but the game looks cartoonish, blood doesn't look realistic at all. Some nice backgrounds can be seen. The game can be intense and provide a nice work-out. I don't think this game should be awarded more than 3/5 stars.","Aug 12, 2019 at 2:19 AM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 16:01:23.111190,Matteo311,A fun game but temper your expectations,"You can see my full review here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F03sU368EyM

Ninja Legends if a fun game but doesn't move theVR genre forward and is more in line with a 2016 VR launch title.  If you are looking for some arcade style melee combat, you will enjoy this game.","Aug 9, 2019 at 1:05 AM",3, 21,
2022-05-28 16:01:23.126150,QueenAkane,Awesome intense ninja ACTION!!,I usually don’t like fighting games but this one is great!! It legitimately feels like I’m in a martial arts movie! The environments are beautiful and the variety of special powers and weapons is actually pretty fun! My brother introduced me to VR a few weeks ago and I think this is one of my new favorites next to Superhot and Beatsaber! Hiya!! I can’t stop slicing these ninjas!!,"Aug 9, 2019 at 11:26 AM",5, 8,
