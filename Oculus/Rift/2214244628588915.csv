2022-05-28 18:15:13.028588,Crypt0Bl0ck,Saving options,The fact that you can't save the game execpt when you sleep or are at the rift really hurts the playability of the game. I've 2 kids so to find time it's rare that I can put the headset on for longer then 30 to 40 minute intervals and it's just not long enough to make progress in the game so you are stuck playing the same level over and over again. Needs an option to save where you stop and pick up from the game in the same spot when you put the head set back on.,25 days ago,1, 38,
2022-05-28 18:15:13.044547,cdrabun89,AMAZING GAME,"I love love LOVE this game. it has great gameplay mechanics, easy to understand combat. I only wish it had online co op so i could play with my friend, even if it scaled up the difficulty. 

My only qualm, and its not even big enough to take away a star, is the durability system. I'm a firearm and blade enthusist, and I can tell you the handguns, rifles, knives and swords would never degrade that quickly in real life, no matter how old they are. all you need is some used motoroil if you don't have any actual gun oil to wipe onto the slides and make sure you keep it clean. That goes the same for knives like the national guard knife. can take being thrown at brick walls and still keep trucking.",May 2 at 2:04 AM,5, 17,

2022-05-28 18:15:13.086434,theskorp,OMG... the best triple AAA game ever!!!,"First off... I have been playing VR for a while now and had time to learn a few things so I feel I have earned an opinion. And man o man this game by far is the best game I have ever played for all the above reasons... immersion, graphics, soundtrack,acting,AI etc... etc... etc... it holds its own side by side to Half Life Alyx. That being said there are only two things I have to comment on and this just happened the other day (developers please listen and respond if possible) my arms are too long and cant change this no matter what i do also not sure if this is because of the same issue but my left and or right hand gets stuck near the white circle where the gun or knife go? This is horrible because I can't pull out my weapon when this happens and I die from a zombie or weapon attack... 

Also just a side note is it possible so when you take out the backpack it can rest freely in the air to allow you to use one hand? If this was a current option I could have opened my backpack with one hand and retrieved a weapon or life from there and survived. Either way this would be a good idea and then if you get to far it automatically goes back behind your back... just say-in :) love you guys cant wait for chapter 2 wooo hooooo",24 days ago,5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:15:13.103388,MallyDude,I keep coming back,"This is hands down one of the best VR games out there. The graphics are stylish, the environment is gritty and the combat system is so good it really feels like im shoving a screwdriver through some guy's skull. The resources are scarce, there is enough to get by but only just, it just keeps you on edge, should you craft that cleaver? or should you wait and use that coveted metal on a shotgun? you have to make difficult decisions and its simply incredible. Also the weapon design. its just spectacular. i mean cmon, double headed axe, made from a circular saw! Society calls for a machete hm? nah, we'll give you a katana made from a lawnmower blade, it fits the environment and looks awesome without going full blown dead rising and making their weapons insanely impractical. The plot is good, its not anything to write home about but its nothing to turn your nose up at either, heck it was good enough to get me to play through the game a solid 8 times maybe more. Of course it wouldnt be much of a Walking Dead game without a horror aspect, and it's there i can guarantee you that. If you want to get scared then look no further, i almost soiled myself about 20 times on my first playthrough, and oh man, in no other game have i avoided one area more than the school in this game. Id rather play through Blight town from DKS1 40 times than go anywhere near that place again, in fact i still dont think ive ever fully explored that haunted mess. Anyways i digress. My fingertips hurt and my keyboard is keeping people awake. if you are looking for a cool zombie game then this game delivers. Big time.",Feb 13 at 7:06 AM,5, 70,
2022-05-28 18:15:16.221050,Bruinic,Exceptional,"For the length of this game, I found it incredibly well paced. It was short, but for the mechanics /story, it was well worth the buy.

2022-05-28 18:15:16.266927,LoganA672,oh. my. god.,"I have always played this game on the native Quest 2, and I am installing it on my computer now.

First, this game is fun beyond belief.

Second, there is a large variety of weapons to choose from, and then even more if you go around the world and unlock the recipes.

Third, the main story is amazing. The characters made me feel sympathy towards them. However, with the release of the Aftershocks DLC, it really created a lot more to do and a lot more fun to have.

Finally, this game is beautiful on the Quest 2. Well, about as beautiful as a run down New Orleans can get.

10/10 would recommend",Dec 30 at 12:09 AM,5, 65,
2022-05-28 18:15:16.280890,Gw3n1th,Insanity,"sure for someone like me this game i could play over and over without getting bored but it can get repetative and there isent much left to do becides another run of the campain. hopefully saints and sinners 2 (or whatever they rename it) will have: more weapons, more locations, new items, a working morale system, veriety of enemy ai, a plot. 

Just a note: high turn speed causes lag and bad frames, if you are like me who plays on mid specs, set it around 40 no higher.",Dec 26 at 5:46 AM,4, 84,

There is no winning anything at the end really, but also no losing less, you just lose really. I wish I would of just got a different game and waited for a better apocalypse story. If you don't care about story at all though, go for it, fun times.",Feb 24 at 8:03 AM,2, 5,
2022-05-28 18:15:19.394562,rowel1038,Just plain awesome,"I'm not necesarily a horror fan, but this game struck a cord. This game has just enough horror to be good for avid horror fans and for people with weak hearts. Only real jumpscares here happen when walkers grab you from behind. The game isn't too forgiving. but it's hard to find good materials in a day. The game offers 20 minutes to grab stuff from different parts of New Orleans and after that, the walkers get riled up by bells, which gives a sense of urgency to rush back to base. Just an awesome game. Also, if you're a fan of chaos and senseless killing, there's also The Trial, where you kill walkers for bytecoins which you then use to make more equipment. Just an overall great game, even though the graphics on Quest 2 are a little lacking.",Feb 12 at 4:25 AM,5, 4,

Otherwise this game is pretty good and would reccomned!!


Edit: so apperantly its only the people who give you stuff back, not the ppl who threaten you with violence, which doesn't make any sense because if someone is willing to kill you for your stuff they clearly need it too, and should count towards the acheivment but it does not..",Dec 22 at 1:16 PM,5, 25,

2022-05-28 18:15:25.707677,mrddixon,Kinda Spectacular,"Openish World Survival Horror. There's about 8 or 9 areas to go to and explore, each area about 4-6 blocks of apocolyptic streets set in New Orleans.  The atmosphere is super dark and moody and a ton polish went in to the graphics and audio. The gameplay is a bit simplistic, but still very satisfying. Every day you get one chance to go one area of the city, with about 20 minutes of real time to loot and accomplish missions before the bells go off and  hordes of zombies overrun the streets. This gives every trek a sense of urgency that really adds tension and drama.  When you get back to the spot, you recyle the day's loot and do some crafting, and then drink yourself to sleep. The story is decent, not spectacular but engaging. 
     The only negative thing I can say is that I wish there was more of everything. More areas, bigger areas, longer story, more thing to craft and unlock.   Also, this is not the most realistic survival game. If you want realism, check out Into the Radius. The is a very streamlined survival game, with an emphasis on the setting and tone, and it does it very well.  One of my favorites.",Dec 20 at 10:44 AM,5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:15:25.724631,Bluray Charles,An absolute blast,"This is a full-length, open-ended VR game that everyone who loves action, shoot+loot, survival, story, or horror games should own. This game is on the short-list of games that would still be absolute bangers even if they weren't VR games. The shooting, the looting, the environments, all of it is great. The game also runs great and just got a big, free DLC update. The Rift version looks great, and while the Quest version is a little rough looking it still plays just as well. Lucky for you the game is cross-buy, so you get both versions anyway.

If you love games where you go on raids to scavenge supplies then this is one you'll love. Can't recommend it enough.",Oct 27 at 2:22 AM,5, 54,

2022-05-28 18:15:25.769511,conor.egglestone,One of the greatest vr games of all time,"This game is probably my favourite as it has horror aspects, crafting and an insane combat system. At the start it might be a little hard to figure out what to do so i would reccomend watching a tutorial or someone playing it. The guns are a little hard to get used to but once you play enough of the gamemode the trial it 
gets much much more easy to kill zombies, but it is quite violent.",Nov 25 at 6:15 AM,5, 11,
2022-05-28 18:15:28.845284,UnderTheWheels3,Fantastic Game,"Pretty much perfect with a few small issues. Looks really good on PC, Quest 2 graphics leave quite a bit to be desired, but it's not terrible and the flawless performance was worth the trade off for the pretty graphics. It still ran pretty well on my PC, but stuttered a bit more than I was comfortable with. The gunplay is fun, but the guns feel a bit too weighty for me personally. Basically your guns barrel trails behind when you strafe, but this is mostly a minor issue down to my taste. Also the enemies are completley deaf, because you can shoot someone just around the corner grom someone else and as long as there isn't line of sight, you're fine. The story was fantastic making you make incredibly difficult moral decisions which are often weighted against making stuff easier/getting better loot. The crafting system was well done, making you choose and prioritize different stuff for advancing your crafting in different directions. 

This game is just good. I don't even like survival games, yet I found this really enjoyable.",Dec 20 at 2:12 PM,5, 2,

You really need all the loot you can find. Always help others so u get more good stuff (u can shot them after they gave u the reward). The Zombies are mostly easy, but if you search for a challenge, wait until the bells ring. The story is so good and lets u make many decisions (especially at the end). It can get a little scary too, when u have to go in dark places. For example in the school. When u finished, dont worry. Theres still more. After the end u can just keep on playing and get all the hidden stuff. Special weapons, items. The stoty takes about 5h and it takes about 15h-20h to unlock all for sure.

Other reviews have put it pretty well to explain the game, although one thing I will note is that the game feels like it's alive (ironic since it's full of dead things). It truly has some soul in it, with the player having an impact on the world with your actions.

2022-05-28 18:16:00.570431,kalron0351,The New Standard for Open World VR,"I should begin by saying I played this game on PC with the oculus link.
The creators of the game went to painstaking lengths to immerse the player through mechanics that no other game is doing, and not enough people are talking about. You can access your inventory, switch weapons, check your map, and quest info without having to pause or freeze the game. If you need something out of your backpack you grab your backpack, if you need to look at your journal you grab your journal. You have holsters all over your virtual body that work quite well after a little trial and error, and that is just the inventory mechanics.
the combat is exceptional. Rather than go through numerious examples I will share with you one experience that will give you a good idea. I approached a human enemy who was shooting at me. I had a hand gun, a machete, and a sword in my holsters. I pulled out my sword, chopped off their head, picked up the head and played with it like a dummy, stored the head in my backpack, took it back to the trailer base hub, and hanged the head on the wall as a trophy, where it still moves it's face everytime I pass it. Do I need to say more, buy this game!
And yet there is more. The crafting mechanic introduces an RPG element that creates a satisfying game loop. If you want stronger weapons and supplies, as well as a few skill perks, you need to collect junk you find out in the world. You store them in your backpack and when you get back to base there is a recycling bin you throw the junk into and automatically add it to the crafting station, which is very easy to use. 
It may not be as pretty as half-life Alyx, but in terms of mechanics it is far superior, and other game makers should be paying attention.","May 20, 2021 at 10:25 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:16:03.649196,A.Smoliak,The best non-demo VR game by var.,"There's no VR game that can beat this one, the fact that you need to grab items based on your holsters is a real boost for immersion. Whilst the graphics are weak on the Quest 2, thanks to Cross-buy you can play it on PCVR via Link or Virtual Desktop. and the graphics there are pretty darn good. I've enjoyed it, and I praise the developers for their hard work (and hard earned money).
Worth the price for sure.","Apr 2, 2021 at 4:25 PM",5, 59,
2022-05-28 18:16:03.665154,eoinok,Hard to put into words how bad this is,"Based on the title you can probably tell I didn't like this game. Every criticism I'm about to make obviously isn't going to be revelant to everyone: Most people love this game. But if the following sounds like it would annoy you, avoid this game like the plague:

- Stylized input latency to simulate the fact that your character is too weak to hold a handgun without it flopping around like a fish
- Never mind the above, the gun is going to disappear after a couple of shots anyway. Items have ""durability"" in this game. Which means you never *have* an item. Instead you have a weird ghostly shadow of an item, which will vanish into nothingness about 8 seconds after you pick up. (Things literally explode and evaporate in your hands - it's just a perfect own-goal as far as design choices go).
- You're starving... but don't think eating will help. Just as matter is immaterial in this game (see above), food is poison. 
- Two conflicting art styles. See that photorealistic wall? Pretty nice. Now look at that cell-shaded brick. And cartoon bricks in a realistic wall are just the start of it: how about impressively detailed, realistic gore on a bobblehead with a comic book face? The clash of styles makes for a game that's ugly when it really doesn't need to be. 

I really did try to get into this game. I know a lot of people love it... I just don't see what they're seeing.","Jun 13, 2021 at 1:42 PM",1, 10,

2022-05-28 18:16:03.697068,Divinexve,My Review. Pros and Cons,"Pros:
- I loved it so much that im going to right away do a 2nd playthrough.
- VR controls move and feel super responsive. It can look a little funny when you turn a doorknob and your hand stretches like 10 feet for a split second though lol.
- Shooting guns and stabbing walkers/people feels extreamly good. The reloading is really realistic, which I like.
- I like the random encounters/speaking with NPCS. It feels really cool whenever an NPC asks ""Hey, can you give me that letter?"" And you physically rummage through your notes to hand the NPC the letter.
- Beating this game psychologically changed me in the sense that for some reason my sense of fear has been sort of...dulled? When I was walking outside IRL a cars tire blew up about 100 feet behind me, making a loud bang. I just sort of looked back and shrugged and kept walking. I dont mean for this to sound like some sort of edgelord comment, but im serious. This game did this to me lol. I used to be super jumpy at stuff like that but that feeling is sort of gone. Probably becuase I have been jumpscared 20 times by zombies breaking down doors, by the end I got used to it.

Cons:
- OK. This is one that I really hate. Why the does every living human enemy NPC have a gun? Were guns just being dispensed out of vending machines in the world? There are literally 0 enemy NPCs who have melee weapons. They. All. Have. Guns. 
- I dont like the fact that weapons cant be reapaired in this game. If your weapons durability is low, guess what, it will break soon and you will have to craft a new one.
- Whenever your weapon breaks, it makes a loud sound, brace yourself.
- I personally dont mind it since I only hit it once, but I can see why others dont like the ""Timer"" system. For those that dont know. Whenever you enter a level, you can only stay in that level for a certain amount of time. Once time runs out (You can see the time tick down on the watch on your left hand), a massive amount of walkers swarm the map.","May 25, 2021 at 12:10 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 18:16:09.984252,HomicydalHermit,Updated review: Great game!!,"Initially between weeks, I couldn't play this game without getting motion sick. If you're someone who's new to VR or prone to VR sickness, I have some tips for you.

1) Set your turning to ""snap"",  with 45 degree increments and then, fine tune your walking direction with your actual head movement.
2) Turn up the ""motion sickness reduction"". Mine is all the way up.
3) I've been playing for hours today and although running up and down stairs still makes me sick, most issues can be avoided as long as you don't try to power through it. For instance: don't run and down stairs lol..

This game is super immersive. It seems surface-level on the first day (the game passes through days) but, after a few days you can really craft some useful items and weapons. 

Dope game. Don't pass this one up. Use the tips I listed if your stomach doesn't like the default settings ;-)","Feb 27, 2021 at 5:10 AM",4, 86,

The crafting and looting system is 9.5/10 as is the holstering and backpack storage system.  Half Life Alyx really is quite terrible in comparison.  However, there might be a little TOO much with the crafting process on-balance with the action aspects - at least early on in the game.

My biggest complaint is that cloud save doesn't appear to cross-save native Quest 2 play with the PC version.

2022-05-28 18:16:16.355213,BillBoss2008,amazing and highly suggest,"why this game is a milestone:

the walking dead saints and sinners is a milestone for what vr is. a great example of what vr can become with given time. comparing this tp arazona sunshine which is a game that came out near when vr came out is a zombie shooter and the walking dead saints and sinners is also a zombie ""shooter"" and shows us what vr is like now compared to when it first came out. 

why it is so good:

the walking dead saints and sinners is amazing because it requiers you to scavenge to advance in the game. all the charecters (besides grunts) have a personality and you get attached to them and the game really imerses me so much and i can tell because in the catacomes i am scared so much to where i check corners and never run unless it is a straight path. since your backpack has so limited space it makes me pick carefully what i need and what i dont. i almost never used my gun because ammo and gun powder are really rare so i was almost always forced to use my shivmany things in the game they got down perfect, for example the combat, the scavenging, the raritey of sertain things and so many others. and the ending is really suspense full when i first reached i felt rushed to grab bandages food and weapons.and then rushed to the action. and i loved it the only thing i can complain about is that the story only takes around 18 hours while gta V campaign is around 50 hours. but all over amazing. 

conclusion:

this game is a milestone and show how fast vr is growing and how it is going to change the gaming world forever and for the most part for the better. usally games are filled with microtransactions, half finished with either the rest no made or a dlc, or just the devolopers are just looking to make a quick cash grab. this game has none of those and is genually fun. you can tell how much the developers took to refine the true survival aspect., the combat and the story. overall the game is amazing. if you have the money you need to get it it is so much fun.","Dec 25, 2020 at 9:11 AM",5, 150,

2022-05-28 18:16:16.419042,VrJohhny,Ridiculously boring and repetitive!,"This game is ridiculously boring and repetitive. On the Quest 2 the game just looks bad, no details. Via virtual desktop it gets so much better. I mean the graphics. I know, a PC is a lot stronger than the quest 2. But here are my some bigger problems:
1. No saving. I can understand that the devs tried to give us a way of feeling lost, so i have to go home to save my game. But this is so frustrating. I am scavenging, searching for stuff, killing walkers, and i want to quit, well then go home! You could have just put some ""save game"" boxes, corners, platforms or whatever in the map like in Alien Isolation, Bonerworks etc.
2. The scavenging  is horrible. It is so boring to search and get the same stuff again and again and again and again just to find out that i dont have any more inventory, so go home, pack everything out, sleep, cause the days passes fast like hell. 10 Minutes and it is already dark??? What the hell! Then you go outside and search again and again and again. So repetitive.
3. The price. I paid 40$ for this game. It is not even near to hl alyx for which i also paid 40. Can you compair them? No. So why the huge pricetag? Greed.
4. You cant even disassemble the walkers. You can cut the arms and the head, but thats it. Why not the legs? I want to see them crawl.
5. Everything gets destroyed after a few kills. My weapons, pistols, sword, everything. 
6. The story is absolutely boring. Why cant i have partners, a bigger map, maybe a car, a bicyle, something?! It is so lame. I am frustrated the whole time. I dont want to explore because there is nothing to explore. 
7. The AI is stupid as hell, why cannot i talk to them if i have the option for an open microphone. Words like, ""i mean no harm"", ""help"", ""i am freandly"" or whatever. The open mic is only good for walkers, like if you want them to hear you, just cough and they will ""run"" to you. Yes, they can run, i dont.Which leads to number 8.

I got it a couple months after release, and Skydance really did a good job on fixing the elements their community complained about or suggested to add. The weight of weapons is beautiful and you always feel immersed in your VR enviroment especially with them listening to us and adding real-time crouching. I have played many flops of VR games (Arizona Sunshine and TWD: Onslaught that's you)  and some good ones too (Gorn, Blade & Sorcery, Boneworks, etc...) and none have compared to this game. I feel truly amazed as I play this game and you should too. Let me set the scene. 

You find the part you need and hear the bells toll. You know you're trapped big time. You pull out your knife and prepare to fight walkers. You kill one as you run out in the darkness of the early night. One down. You hear growls and realize you are surrounded. You struggle to pull the knife out of the walker's head, and it finally breaks free. Except that's the problem, it BREAKS. Now you're defenseless surrounded by walkers on all sides at nighttime. You run and run and are grabbed by a walker. You just barely grab a glass bottle and smash it on the walker's head. It stops, stunned, and you take that time to stab it with the bottle and run. You make it to your skiff and just barely make it out into the damp night back to your safehouse.

That is a real experience I've had. Get the game. Trust me.","Nov 7, 2020 at 11:45 PM",5, 12,
2022-05-28 18:16:38.464080,Kunakai,This game feels like work. Not fun.,"I've tried the Quest and desktop versions, they're both fairly similar. 

My biggest problem with the game is how quickly weapons break and how many materials you need to actually upgrade anything. 

I'm a fan of zombie games generally speaking but this isn't comparible to Fallout/State of Decay or anything else you might want it to be comparible to in terms of what makes them fun. It is directly comparible in regards to things that frustrate. 

Weapon degredation can be a cool feature pushing you to gain more weapons/materials in order to progress, leading to loot feeling like a reward. Unfortunately the implementation here feels too severe, leading to looting feeling like busy work. Limited inventory space makes shuffling what you want/need feel like a chore. The cost of crafting supplies/weapons only adds to the problems with the previously mentioned issues, making the game feel more like a futile scrounge for materials than a game. 

The gunplay also feels lacking. I get that aiming shouldn't be simple but it seems like many shots carfully aimed just miss. 

The story is slow and feels pretty pointless as far as I've experienced.  

To add insult to injury I'm usually left feeling a little ill after playing for extended periods (I should note that even Skyrim with smooth movement doesn't leave me feeling as bad). 

I really can't understand why people find this so compelling in a world where games like Half Life Alyx and Zero Caliber exist. If it were my first VR experience I would probably have felt disappointed to say the least.","Dec 5, 2020 at 2:45 AM",1, 8,

2022-05-28 18:16:41.662524,ItsKrypt,A well polished game with a few caveats,"First of all, the game is great so far. Weapons and items feel weighty, which is something most VR games are missing. You can't swing an axe at the speed of light with 1 hand. I like that. The graphics look great, and so far the story seems engaging.

My only issue (so far) is the HUD. During dark scenes, when you're fighting or running, the HUD appears and is SO BRIGHT. I play this game on a Quest via Link, and the display in that headset is good, except the contrast in those situations is very poor. The bright HUD washes the entire scene out and I struggle to see properly. Add this to the lens flare and God rays of that headset and dark scenes become almost unbearable.

I'd like to see a HUD brightness or colour option, not just a simple toggle on/off.

I've also encountered a headache inducing bug where the left eye flashes uncontrollably during a loading screen. This is potentially very dangerous.

What I also love about the game is that it has the perfect amount of difficulty. Its not to hard but it is also a bit challenging. However the thing that stunned me the most is the gravity and physics in this game. Bigger weaons have a heavier wheight, and when you drop something on your hand it actually comes in contact with your hand. The Meatgrinder update just made the game even more fun. It gives you something to do once you have completed the game. The devs made an absolute masterpiece. The only suggestion I have is co-op modes.

2022-05-28 18:16:44.820079,solisis,"Total frustration, Weak game","First off, this has nothing to do with the walking dead except there happens to be zombies and you can sort of smear guts on yourself. Otherwise, might as well have been called evil dead, 28 days later, or any other zombie game.

Don't ignore the warnings. The stamina system is a total joke. The melee system is a comical effort at best, but can occasionally work. It just doesn't work well most of the time. Gun mechanics are ridiculous. Weapon durability is just made up to try to add challenge to a bad design. Crafting is nonsense as well. Why would cooking gumbo somehow make your weapons break less easily? And how on earth do you craft a 45 ACP revolver out of thin air but your crafted blades look like someone just taped a bunch of junk together?

Suffice it to say the game suffers immensely by poor design and a lack of planning and coordination to make it fit the walking dead universe. It is frustratingly limited, and utterly inconsequential. You run around collecting trash. You craft other trash with it. You kind of follow a story if you can get things to work. But ultimately, there's no reason to care, but every reason to stay away.

This game is weak. Complete junk in a sea of VR options. I give it 2 stars because it can be occasionally amusing when things go your way. But mostly it's just a bunch of massive inconveniences and frustrations that don't seem to lead anywhere.

If you want a zombie game, get AZ Sunshine and leave this pile of feces where it belongs. In an un-flushed toilet bowl somewhere deep in the apocalypse.","Oct 31, 2020 at 12:35 PM",2, 7,
2022-05-28 18:16:44.836036,MerlinDab,Great game for the genre,"As with almost any game it's incredibly difficult to get it right in every category especially in a genre like VR where it's still very new and unexplored. Saints and sinners get it right in the most important areas of combat, immersion and enjoyability.

Combat feels great and super 'realistic' for the walking dead universe. You start with small makeshift weapons and slowly work your way up to some bad*ss weaponry that makes you feel unstoppable and that is kind of where the game falls short. You spend most of the game working your way up to get the best gear and when you finally have it there is nothing to use it on.

The story is quite short sitting at an average of 18 hours but as of writing this I have 17 hours of playtime and completed about 4-5 hours of achievement hunting after completing the story so whether I'm fast or the estimate is off I do not know. Now there is nothing wrong with a short story but when the story mostly involves repetitive tasks such as fighting your way through a human safe house to collect intel or pump parts all the while looting the same types of items it can get a little tedious. The human AI does leave a bit to be desired as well because it's incredibly difficult to be killed by them and even if you kill one of their friends in the next room with a loud gun shot you can still sneak up on them.

Despite this I found the game immensely fun and thoroughly enjoyed the game. It's clear that the main reason for the shortcomings I've mentioned so far is that they've had to invent the basics because it's in VR which is why I have no problem with them and look forward to a potential sequel which will allow them to spend more time developing other areas now that they have the basics.

I know The Walking Dead: Onslaught is made by a different studio but I have no doubt they will have learnt a lot from S&S and If Skydance choose to make a sequel they'll be able to do the same to Onslaught.","Aug 30, 2020 at 5:01 PM",4, 82,

2022-05-28 18:16:57.456282,joshjh2002,Awesome! Worth the money!,"ORIGINAL REVIEW -
I have just completed my first playthrough. Some of the decisions you have to make are really tough and I enjoyed the experience a lot. I plan on playing it again, but as an evil Tourist in the very near future. I will say that once you complete the story, there isn't much else to do other then scavenge for supplies and unlock all the crafting recipies, of which there are lot, so I have that to keep me busy. Definatly a great buy, and I'm super excited for more content. The addition of physical crouching makes the game so much more enjoyable. The only negative is that the game sometimes enters these really weird lag spikes and that's kind of annoying. I have a Ryzen 7 2700X and a Vega 64, so my PC should be more than capable, but the lag spikes are only for a few seconds so I can deal with it.

JULY 2020 -
I wrote a review not too long ago explaining that the game is fun, but some things needed improving and there should be more in the way of content. Well, today, the Meatgrinder update arrived and I have to say, the addition of a mode that allows you to fight off waves of enemies and come up with creative ways to kill them so they don't use too much stamina is awesome! I can see myself playing forever in the new Trial mode until I become as good at slaying walkers as Rick Grimes. I'm looking forward to being able to see more content in the future!","Jul 15, 2020 at 8:00 AM",5, 49,

The immersion of the gameplay for this title is pretty much the best out there in my opinion.  Atmosphere, mechanics and of course the story!  One thing that I would love to see is some sort of boss/leader spawns occasionally after the herd is stirred to up or even during regular play.

2022-05-28 18:16:57.507146,JuicyFruit40,They come through with true horror.,"I have to say that this title is one of the most terrifying VR games to play since Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. The next title Onslaught should be very intrigiuing to see. I feel as im TRULY immersed in the TWD universe. The fact you can TURN ON VOICE so they literaly can hear you is amazing. And scary AF.  I have yelled obecenities at the walkers! HA! At one point i was in the graveyard near the bus rest place thats safe enough, i was looking around to clear the area if i needed to, my dog barks, scares the crap out of me.  Wether you like being stealthy or just go out loud and take on every walker and PERSON that wants you dead or for breakfast. YES, this game is worth the price tag.  My pro's and con's are simple.  
Pros: Creepy atmosphere you'd expect.
Many different pathways to take to avoid walkers 
Pure gore when you kill a walker especially the brain stab.
You can see your arms, not just hands like in many VR titles.
Cons:
Glitchy tools on yours VR self, it tends to flicker and just looks weird.
No Co-Op gameplay that im sure everyone would love.
Audio tends to cut out every once in awhile, This could be a hardware specfic thing on my end.  I have not gone through the ENTIRE game as of yet but i figure i could leave a decent overall review for now and so far it has a full 5 stars for me. Will update review if anything changes. So far, buying this game is recommended at any reasonable price tag.","Aug 23, 2020 at 6:47 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 18:16:57.525098,Snake-Plissken,Great game with little replayability,"*disclaimer You will probably enjoy the game much more with a trainer. 

I did part of the game before using a trainer, since it's only singleplayer and there's absolutely nothing wrong with using a trainer in singleplayer. Meleeing was a stamina hog. So when there's a group and you don't have your gun or it broke (all weapons break after not much use), to kill a walker with melee, you pretty much need a blade of some sort, then (if it has the proper stats) you can decapitate it, otherwise you have to stab its head, push the blade to the brain, then rip it out. When you run out of stamina, you can't pierce the brain.

There is weighted melee, so swinging fast makes the game have to catch up. When you go to stab a head, you might not have enough momentum and it'll miss or clip through the head. Then sliding the blade in is awkward after it took so much momentum.

Once I progressed and got a Katana, it was awesome. Every time I grabbed it, it made a *shink!* sound and decapitations were a breeze, even one handed. I used it more than I used any gun.

Once I beat the game, I could go back and kill walkers, but there's little to do outside of that. Multiplayer would've been nice, though Onslaught looks like it has that covered, and will have actual characters, and some weapons that aren't in this.

*one glaring issue I had, and I only noticed this after having used a trainer, was unlimited spawns. To leave your safe area, you approach a small rowboat with a map on it, then you pick an area and it loads. You have a watch on your hand with a circle and a small highlighted part at the top. When the bar reaches that point, the church bells ring and it attracts walkers. Sometimes I would overstay my welcome (I guess) and the bells would ring. The map would not let me leave and walkers would never quit spawning. I had to kill myself and respawn to fix the issue. It wasn't because of the trainer, it's just how the game works.","Aug 30, 2020 at 1:23 PM",3, 6,

2022-05-28 18:17:00.700604,xXZacBroXx,WAY TO HARD,I love the game and the story is fantastic however I struggle to understand why it’s so hard? It takes the fun out of missions and task and free roaming around. And part of what makes the game so hard is you hardly have any stamina! U run 30ft and your character is outta breathe? The zombie interactions and noises are on point however they need to lay off a bit... every time I see one walker 8 more don’t need to join the party. Another thing is how does a knife brake after piercing 3 skulls? This makes the game super hard as well... as much as I love the game it became a pain in the rear to leave my bus and go out and do anything after day 10. Also you get sick way to fast and there’s never any medication to find.,"Oct 2, 2020 at 11:37 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 18:17:00.717559,shiny6,Great game. Could be even better.,"This is one of my favorite virtual reality games. Granted, I've only really been into VR for a year and have only played a handful of full on GAMES. It's still really cool! I just recently beat the main story and am now working on getting my upgrade benches maxed out. There are, however, some things I would love to be added/improved.

glitches:
I know every game is bound to have them, but there have been times where i really wish some would get fixed. For example: items that fall sometimes go crazy and jump all over the floor. Not game changing, but can be an annoyance. 
stuttering: as I progress through the game, I noticed more and more lag/stuttering where a couple frames get skipped. I have seen others talk about this, so I am sure it is a known issue. It would be great if fixed though.

new features: As of now, I am starting to get tired of the game since the story is over. There is still some stuff to do, but I can see it getting old within a month or two. I would LOVE some more feature updates. I have seen lots of really cool ideas that could maybe be worked out. (whisperers would be sick)

overall, the pros outweigh the cons in my opinion. The only real cons really are just the glithces. I can't wait to see what comes next for this game and for skydance.","Jul 18, 2020 at 2:07 PM",4, 23,

-Great voice work from everyone, especially JB
-Overall polished VR experience

Cons
-nothing worth doing after you finish the main story (5-15 hrs of gameplay depending how you play), this is the biggest con, because you only get some recipes/items right at the end, and by that point, there's nothing worth doing with them
-over-the-shoulder storage has some bugs
-zombies spawn-cheat, never popping into existence right in front of you, but spawning in places they were clear before that they could not have accessed

Plus, major glitches. Things moving on their own (like the cigarette pack when dropped), stuttering of characters like may....and I got impatient and killed that JB person so I could get that gear for the last pump assembly....and yet he's still talking on the radio channel 57. I killed him. He's dead. He shouldn't even be on the radio as far as I'm concerned doing his broadcasting.....unless the Logic you want me the player is concerned is that ""you and I know he's dead, but no one else does, so whoever is on channel 57 is using pre-recorded Broadcasts to cover for the fact he's dead"" (( shrugs ))

edit:/updatre:
I beat the game in 10 game days with no cheats. There *is* a cheat available for the rift-s edition if you go look and download it. Its how I was able to beat the game down from 77 game days to 15. Wondering if the Oculus QA team know anything of this....
Plus in the Quest 2 edition, WTF is up with the pixleated sky and that odd human shaped blip in the center of the sky when you look straight up? Its not there on the Rift-s edition, nor is it there on the Quest 1 edition...

As for the cheat i found (yes, it works) go look up ""The walking dead saints and sinners cheat"" and its available by ""WeMod"". It allows for infinate ammo, health, stamina, weapon use/stamina, zombies cant ""grab"" or bite you, you cant be infected by the diseased zombies. Kinda cool if tou ask me.....","Nov 30, 2020 at 3:58 AM",3, 4,

I just finished the main story and am greatly enjoying going through all the areas and collecting everything around the world. That being said... Now that I have managed to calm down after rage quitting, I wanted to just drop a humble little note for the devs. Please... please rework the shotguns! Trying to get two hands on those things is like trying to grab the head of an angry cobra! The physics are completely bonkers, and it appears as though all wrist strength is removed the second one grabs a shotgun. I have time after time struggled to get the second hand on the shotgun in a frenzy only to wave it around like a moron and get swarmed by zombies in the process. Grabbing frantically for the front grip, trying to gain enough control to aim accurately. As i said, this game is pure AAA quality with immense replay value, well worth every penny, but Im worried that ill have to choose between not playing the game anymore because the shotgun is infuriating, or having to simply never use the shotguns again... which would suck, because its an essential zombie slaying tool.","Jul 20, 2020 at 8:23 PM",4, 10,

crouch is a nice addition, though I still find myself using the button a lot of times.

I hope there will be some DLC in the future, as I wish there was a bit more to do after you complete the main story. 
Maybe an additon/increase in the NPCs you can interact with, specialized random quests each day in different maps, or some other ways to create goals other than just achievment hunting.

Like I said, I wanted to kill zombies, and in order to do that you need weapons. The most interesting weapons are understandably locked at the start, but they required a ton of resources just to get the ability to craft them. Another problem with weapons is the guns. They can basically only be crafted, finding a functioning firearm is rare, and if you do manage to find one it's in terrible shape.

But that ending though kinda a let down. I was hoping for maybe some extra dialogue or random survivors contacting me  thru the radio to give little side quest but no.

Still worth a buy in my opinion

2022-05-28 18:17:29.208356,ZamnZaddy,"Fun, but not worth $40 IMO","Hands down this is the best zombie game I’ve ever played in VR. The physics are great and the zombies are scary. I really enjoyed the first 30 minutes of playing, but after that, the game started feeling a bit boring and repetitive. Like other reviewers mentioned, it feels like an arcade shooter at some point. The locations look the same. The zombies look the same. 

My biggest issue with the game, however, is the speed at which you move throughout. It’s very slow, and to pick up the pace you must run- which only lasts about 10 seconds before you run out of stamina and must wait for it to refill. I feel like I’m slogging around the game, completing endless objectives with no real reward. 

Another let down for me was the games ending. It felt anticlimatic and underwhelming. It was probably the least adrenaline-boosting part of my experience.

The game is nowhere near awful, I just feel like I overspent with the $40 USD price tag. I’d be happy if I paid $30, but if some tweaks are made to the gameplay and more content is added to the game... I’ll be very happy with my purchase.","May 16, 2020 at 2:34 PM",4, 34,
2022-05-28 18:17:29.227306,Manydoors,Turns into zombie arcade game.,"Really entertaining and interesting zombie game, much better than I expected.  It combines zombie bashing in with RPG and survival elements really well.  But as always there are some downers with the game.  
1 - You run out of stamina after 5 seconds of running then come to a complete halt sounding as if you are about to keel over and die.  What on earth is that all about.
2 - The days are far to short and you find yourself rushing around the map scavenging before the bells ring.  You don't have enough time to explore and take in the great world that they have created.  Timers and this rush the player thing is something I really hate.  Loses a star.
3 - As the days progress so do the amount of zombies you encounter. After day 15 this becomes ridiculous and you can't do anything but kill zombies as they come at you endlessly.

It's worth buying I suppose, but it would be a firm recommendation if they done something about the daft mechanic's described above.   They only take away from the games enjoyment.","Mar 12, 2020 at 4:11 PM",4, 332,

This is the work of a faction called the tower. He leaves you his shelter, a bus hidden which will be your base throughout the game. You ocasionally go out to scavenge or progress the story.
This game is currently my favourite game to play at the moment and i have not even finished the story! Love that you have to fight walkers and other people. You can go in guns blazing or be very stealthy. I am not giving 5 stars because of a bug that is ruining my experience by sometimes making my weapons in my heavy and small weapon slots to disapear. Amazingly i play on oculus link which makes the quality the exact same as a rift or rift s and apart from the bug i am very satisfied with this game would recomend to anyone that isn't squeamish.

2022-05-28 18:17:35.537428,D1NGU5_D1DDL3R,Advice.,"I really enjoyed this game. However, it was definetely missing a lot of things. For starters, not enough storyline. Felt like it was over way too fast, and I really hope that more stuff is added. Second off, there should be more weapons added. Another thing with weapons is that there should be a repair option for them. It really sucks to have some wolverine like claws or a cool bat that's just gonna break after a few hits. Something I would also like seeing is maybe being able to bring survivors to your camp and have them be able to scavenge for you, come along missions with you, or make things for you. You could even be able to expand your base. Then for the factions, there isn't really much to go on off of. For the Tower, we never get to see ""Mama"" or even enter the tower. Not to mention all the times they insulted me for the way I walk. When it comes to the reclaimed, I think there is a lot more things that could be added. Oh, and they also insulted my walking. Now for the zombies, I would enjoy being able to put them on a leash and keep them as a pet. The main issue I have for them is that if you cut both of their arms off, they die. The final thing I have for the walkers is maybe seeing them eating random corpses, stuck in vehicles, hanging from a lamp post, etc. The last thing I think that could be added is animals. With these, you could have a pet, be able to start a farm, or maybe see what they've been up to after the world ended. But all in all, I really want to see more from this and I am hoping that the developers haven't abandoned it.

I completted the whole story and fully upgraded the crafting benches in 13 hours. There was also some frame rate drops after playing for a little bit. It could be my computer but it doesnt usually glitch like that. My only other complaint is that there was a point in the story where it wouldn't let me progress any farther (the tomb and the tower pt. III), it turns out that I had to complete a different quest first to continue, so for like three or four in game days I just wandered around searching and bummed beause I thought I couldnt progress. A little hint somewhere wouldv'e been nice. Overall I am glad that I bought this game and it was an extremely fun 13 hours.

I would easily have paid three times the amount for this game, however unfortunately there is no real way of knowing which games are virtually flawless and which totally stink on VR. Short of some very biased reviews. 

I can say this game was better than Stormland which I personally think is one of the best games developed for Oculus Rift S VR. The game starts out a little slow and me be a bit confusing but once you get the hang of it your hooked.

I can't wait for the next version of The Walking Dead and Stormland. These are truly amazing games not like half the nonsense which shouldn't even be in the Oculus store. 60 percent of the games are not developed or half developed.

This is super disappointing for most experienced VR players. VR is all about interacting with the game world. Pressing a button to crouch is just wrong. Even the bad Skyrim VR port did that right.

I hope the developers fix this, because then it could be the game of the year for me. Graphics are incredible, the voice acting is awesome and the melee is great. 

If the developers fix it, Saints and Sinners will be known as the best zombie VR game. 

If they don’t, it will be forever known as the one VR game where you cannot crouch.

2022-05-28 18:17:51.406983,ryaninja540,AAA VR game with some slight flaws.,"(17 hours of gameplay so far for reference)

 Incredible open world AAA walking dead game. The combat, physics, crafting, and production value are all top notch. It really feels like your in a zombie apocalypse. The tension is always there. And it gets super intense when your surrounded by a horde of zombies, the horde timer is running out, and your on your last few bullets. 

There are a few things that need to be changed for the better though. Once it's patched I'll update to 5 stars

1. Increase walking speed. It's waaaay to slow.

2. Increase stamina bar. You should be able to run longer than 5 seconds without getting completely winded.

3. The respawn rate for zombies can get kinda frustrating sometimes. Mostly when walker appears from thin air when your back is turned.

(Thank you for fixing the 6DOF with the physical crouching!)

Regardless of these minor flaws it's still a must play for all.","Mar 5, 2020 at 3:46 PM",4, 47,

Your character has NO cardio at all so running in any situation is a complete waste of charchter energy as he is so gassed as to be completely defenceless after only about 10 metres of running. Weapons of any kind found in the beginning of the game including firearms only last barely more than a dozen times if that before they break & become useless, all while the game continually spawns zombies until you've run out of viable ammo & flimsy weapons & become a sitting duck for the countless spawning zombies. When you die you have the option of respawning in the same location & picking up your dead characters stash but I found this a terrible option as you spawn with little to no weapons & the world is way mpore populated with zombies than before you died & each time you die it seems to get incrementally worse. Remember this is after you struggled with all your weapons in the first place so how the game developers expected you to do better in worse conditions with less belongings is beyond me. So I found myself redoing the same location over again, making great progress until I'm ready to go back to the home base when the game inundates your path back with countless respawning zombies until you die, which would have been awesome to navigate if the game gave players the ability to actually do so. Obviously there is no save game option either which if provided could have made considerable difference. I really wish I could get my money back for this game, as I've barely made any progress at all to show for the hours I've put in. I've seen very little of the game & don't see any reason to keep persisting given the constant frustration.","May 7, 2020 at 6:50 PM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 18:17:51.462834,Preying_Owl,SO AWESOME AND FUN!!!!!!,"I loved this game sooooo much. The story was really good and challenging, and surprised me so much at the end! The game isn't really that scary, it will make audible noise when a zombie finds you and it is soo easy to tell where they are. Starting out is so much fun, scavenging, stabbing, and walking. But near the end it  is even better, because you have OP knives, and guns that you can use to kill zombies. But theres more! You can find secret items that aren't a game changer but are sooooooo much fun to use. Like wolverine claws. The only problem I have with this game was walking from place to place, I wanted to run but running makes you have less stamina and less stamina makes you die. The only way to get your stamina back is by eatting food, which is found thourgh out the world, but the catch is that it will lower your health. Which is annoying because the only food that doesn't lower health is food you make which is hard to get in the beginning because of such low supplies, and it is the same for later days because supplies will dwindle.

There is a glitch that breaks the game and aparently there is no solution.The game is completely unplayable after the story mission ""When The Levee Breaks III"" I have completed all other missions and have waited about 7 in game days. The game continues to get harder and harder as time progresses, but you are unable to access the new gear and survival material you need in order to keep up. It was moderately difficult when I started it, now I can not go out an a mission with out dying at least 4 times. Also the handling of any firearm is very very clunky to say the least. It feels like they are trying to add a good amount of ""weight"" to the weapon which is understandable, but it does not translate when you are trying to aim and shoot and your in game hands are way behind your actual hands, very confusing and RUINS immersion.

That being said it seems like it could be an amazing amazing game with sooo much potential. My origional rating was 4 stars and my origional post is below. 

I have never been into zombie movies or games to be honest. I have never seen an episode of the walking dead. But wow this game is pretty amazing. I am only about 3 hour in and im very impressed. There are a few things that could be improved, such as the tracking while handeling objects, but all in all its a great game.

  Since my wife and I are hunkered down as a result of Covid-19 harbor in place mandate we took the chance...  Well I'm here to tell you ""money well spent"".

  My wife is not as big a geek as I am and to be fair, she gets a little irritated when the controls are not intuitive and if they are not flexible and forgiving for not being ""exact"".  She picked up the fundamentals of the game no problem and in short order she was playing quite intuitively.

   We thoroughly enjoy the resource hunting/management, RPG and survivalist aspect of the play mechanics.  Being older (In our 50s) we appreciate the cerebral aspects of the game as much as the zombie bashing.

  Graphics are not ultra realistic but more stylistic which IMHO is a smart move as too many games try too hard to look pretty but fall flat on actual game-play...  That's not to say the art is poor in any way but quite the contrary.  The artists did an excellent job of putting details in the right place to maximize the ambiance and to suck you into the world...  Same with the sound. The rag-doll physics of the zombies and NPCs are well done as are the physical way objects can be used as tools and weapons.

For example I would do the task to install the microphone   and then the next few tasks and then do some krafting, adjust my health and stamina etc. Then stop playing and when I went back it took me about 2  tasks back. The last save still took me back about 2 tasks.  I was pretty unhappy about this and just uninstalled the gave and regretted that I bought it. In addition  I hate that its timed.

Really fantastic!
Only problem i encountered on my short try was the sound drops sometimes. the place when i run between the graves.
Tomorrow im gonna move all my furniture , kick out wife n kids and play this game all weekend.
I tried it now but when the zombies attacked i was trying to wack them away with my arms but i forgot my closet.
Dont let the price scare u away. Its really well worth it. 
If this game get less then 4-5 stars on reviews then sell ur vr headset and go play back fortnite.

If theres a multi player cross platform also planned for in the future then this game will be the God of all games.

Please add/fix these things:

When you drink a soda you should be left with an empty can. Same with some foods.
Why can’t we pick up bricks, chairs, and other objects on the ground.
Not enough items in the game that it becomes too repetitive.
Not enough stuff to craft.
Maybe make it so you have to find 2 or more specific items to make them into something.
Putting a flashlight on a hat/helmet for better flashlight use. Also I think it would be better if you had to shake the flashlight more than once to charge it.
Add more body parts to grab instead of just the head.
My least favorite thing about the game is that too many buildings can’t be entered.
Remove the “?” above the crafting stations after reading them the first time
Make dead zombie bodies stay there longer.
Why do guns break so easily?
You can light cigarettes so what if you could pour gasoline and throw a lit cig!
Add more food and the ability to cook food.
The watch should vibrate the left controller instead of beeping. The beeping would get you killed.","Feb 1, 2020 at 9:32 AM",5, 117,

I literally check my Oculus for new updates to the game every couple of days just to see if you've fixed things so I can beging playing again.  The fact that when you die, you loose your entire backpack and have to go fetch it, for me, is horrible. I get it.

2022-05-28 18:18:10.468999,JackDiddley,A Great Game If You Like Rubbery Arms,"The good:
They did a great job with immersion, more than any other game or experience that I've seen in VR, I really feel like I am walking around in New Orleanes.  The details are excellent.  The rush you get the first time you stab a walker is awesome.  
It took me a while to understand the goal in the game, comparing and collecting inventory items to upgrade the workbenches.  At first I was put off by the inventory system, I can fit 27 computer keyboards in the same space that gets filled up with 27 little boxes of matches... because each item is really just its scrap resources.  Balance.
The immersion I mentoined before is over the top, walking through the streats, sneaking around in buildings, the use of the flashlight.  All perfectly executed. Even the music, this is one of the few games I turn the music down but not all the way off. 
The depth here is also impressive, progressively building your resources, how you handle the missions, how you treat people when you encounter them. This game is a cut above the rest when it comes to handling 'menus' so that you don't feel like you are playing a video game.
The bad:
So why only three stars?  The entire reson this game goes from 5 stars down to 3 is holstering and rubbery arms.  Yes, this feature is so immersion break, and game breaking that it makes the whole experience comical.  The weight of a single pillow, or even a full pack of cigarettes sends your whole wrist in to a rubbery twist, like gumby.  
Your 'game hand' not being where your physical hand is can be quite disruptive when you thought you put your weapon away, but dropped it on the ground somewhere instead.
In real life even a 10 year old can pick up a baseball bat without their arm going limp out of control. I've never seen anyone looking visibly encumbered by a full pack of cigarettes.
In short, this game has a lot of ground breaking features, the mechanics, the mapping, building up your home base... and almost entirely ruined by a silly feature.","Mar 22, 2020 at 11:30 PM",3, 3,

And there are end game events that can take place, which the bells can be cancelled. 3, It woulden't be intresting if the every day stayed the same, same zombies, same loot, Say you have a stacked loadout, shotgun, ar15, knife, exlposives.

[UPDATE] 2 Days after Launch, Devs patched the worst of the bugs and oversights, such as the gun weapon angles which have been completely fixed. Simply great work by these devs. Truly. 

Refreshingly, this game manages to do something that VR has weirdly struggled to achieve, and gives us an engaging story, with plot, and objectives, and crafting, and decision based outcomes, AND action, and combat, with physics that I'd say fall a notch or two short of Boneworks and B&S, AND beautiful, unique and polished graphics. I've heard the spacial audio is pretty cool, however, Oculus seems to just not care that the Quest microphone drivers don't work, so I couldn't tell you personally.

That said, don't expect anything much more groundbreaking than that. The game isn't 6DOF, which means, no croutching, bending over to pick things up, or real life verticle movement. In 2020, that's a pretty big draw back. The stamina and health system seems way too punishing, as does the time sensative nature of the storyline. (or rather, time simply moves way too quickly.). Each area is big enough and dressed up enough to give you the slightest illusion of open world, but are still very much not. Interactivity is minimal. Basically, if its not a door, weapon, or usable item, you can't interact with it at all. As of the new patch, I haven't encountered any bugs.","Jan 27, 2020 at 6:57 AM",4, 21,

While I agree with a lot of the cons posted here (stamina runs out too fast, walking speed too slow, weapons break too easily, etc.), they're all pretty nit-picky when you get right down to it, and none of them really hindered my enjoyment of the game.  This game absolutely blows away Arizona Sunshine, which was probably the best VR zombie game before this came out.  My ONLY real gripe with the game...

<SPOILER ALERT, STOP READING NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE END GAME INFO>

My only real gripe with the game is that the haul you get from the reserve at the end if you chose that path is kind of disappointing.  Yes there is a fair amount of stuff, but at most you can take 2 of the guns, and then to make it worse they lock the gate off after so you can't even go back and bring back more stuff if you want to keep playing in survival mode after.  Considering all I went through to get it I thought 2 ARs, some ammo (ok a lot of ammo...), and a bunch of junk boxes was a bit of a lame haul.  Still though, that complaint only really applies if you want to keep playing after the story is finished, so even that won't be such a big deal for most people.

Anyway, awesome awesome awesome game, WELL worth the money, especially if you're a WD fan.","Mar 19, 2020 at 8:09 AM",5, 0,

Crouching with a button was lame, and while the alpha fix has  minor issues, they pale in comparison to not being able to crouch.

What can I say about this game? It's fast become my favorite VR game to date. Boneworks is interesting, and shows what VR can be, but it falls on its face every five seconds. This? This is the stuff. It doesn't feel like a proof of concept. It feels like a smart evolution.

To nitpick, survivor AI is pretty dumb, in ways that break immersion at times (running through their own barb wire traps cause they heard something?), but that's about all I have for complaints.

The gunplay and melee weapon interactions are best in class, with loads of clever touches. Want to empty the bullets out of a revolver you've found that's about to break? Simply open up the cylinder and point the barrel to the sky. Want to break through wooden boards? Either lever them off with a crowbar, and smash through them with an axe. It all makes sense.

The balance of resources and enemies seems almost perfect. I love the gameplay loop of running against the clock when out in the city, and then having all the time to complete tasks near the bus. I love how the enemy density shifts around from day to day. I love hunting for supplies.

I'm curious how they're going to pull this off on the Quest, but I'm very happy that it works perfectly via Link. Worth every penny, and arguably the first proper single player campaign I've played. It's got good story. Good music. Clever level design, and so many neat little attentions to detail.

It's a big step forwards for VR. Hopefully just the first in a year that's going to bring us HL Alyx.

If you bought VR to play HL Alyx, you have to buy this. It's so good I'd argue it's almost worth buying a headset for by itself.","Feb 2, 2020 at 2:43 AM",5, 4,

The gameplay and the immersive environment is something people rarely do and I'm so happy that these devs actually did it. You really FEEL like you are there throughout the whole thing and that isn't exaggerating.

HOWEVER...once you beat the game, there is no real replayability. The ability to 
make your own choice is there, but it is the most linear system in the world. You can either join the Tower....or not. There, that's your choices. That and you can save or kill a guy named Casey. Save him for no loot, or kill him for lots of loot. Ending is the same no matter what in the actual hell you do.

You can keep playing and scavenging, but then what is the point? You loot, kill some walkers (which can get boring) and you fight some people (which is not boring yet). You go home, sleep, do it all again.

They need to imporve the endgame drastically because once you beat the game (which is about 6 hours), you can uninstall the game. There is nothing more you can do.","Mar 7, 2020 at 10:32 AM",3, 1,

Ok, I am a big fan of the Walking Dead series; or at least the first 5 seasons. I always asked myself how it would feel to be right there, and how I would act. Now I know it.

The graphics and atmosphere is spot on. That lonely and dreading feeling, never feeling safe, except when you get to the safe places, which you learn to love even if they are a pile of crap. Killing the walkers is fun - I don't know how, but I feel the resistance of those rotten skulls when I stab them. The management system with the journal, flashlight, backpack etc. - works very well. 

Also, I never had that intense feeling of really being there, with no other VR game so far. Not sure if it is a good thing all in all, but I was sometimes totally disconnected from the real world.

I hate that my Rift is getting too uncomfortable after an hour to continue playing. 

Big applause to the creators of this game.

UPDATE 30.01.2020:

I love the game, but I am inclined to take one star away. I find the use of firearms not really perfect, like in ""Arizona Sunshine"" or similar. Also because the arms somehow feel too slow in their movement and aiming is not natural.

Further, the game is still buggy. It took me a long time to finish a job, and then on the way back - literally a few meters away from the rescue boat - I got stuck between a fence and a waste container. No chance to free myself. Really annoying.","Jan 31, 2020 at 6:39 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 18:18:39.107401,CarloFromMilkyWay,Well done. Please add the option to save,"Before buying the game I have read many reviews on the Oculus Store. Most of the comments are positive. Among the defects, however, often are mentioned: the slowness of our character; the problem of crouching; the low intelligence of the NPCs and the little depth and ""explorability"" of the levels. My personal opinion is that the speed of our character is almost never annoying or frustrating. It only becomes tedious when we need to travel through parts of a level that have already been explored and we want to avoid wasting time seeing again the same areas. Crouching has perhaps been improved since I purchased the game, because isn't a problem at all. Like in other games, we will use the crouch button to walk in stealth mode. All the movements and interactions seems natural. A little exception for the hands that stays opened and rigid when in the natural position. NPCs are divided between Zombies, which don't necessarily have to be brilliant, and other characters. Indeed it happens that the latter recite a too repetitive script and that they “losing their memory”. But I think this depends on the fact that many NPCs are strongly characterized, they have their own story to tell. They do it every time we interact with them, but at least the dialogues are credible, well-acted, interesting. In short, NPCs have personalities, and this is more important to me than their tendency to be repetitive.

 The levels are well studied. Here, however, we should not get confused. The Walking Dead Saints & Sinners is not an open game, like Fallout or Skyrim, where, for example, we can enter in almost every home and get lost in a world designed to credibly simulate the depth of reality. I don't think this goal was even part of the developers' aims. In TWDS&S the levels are designed to tell a certain story, or to deepen it always by following precise narrative lines. Not all software houses have tens of millions of dollars to create credible and complex worlds. This title seems pleasant, engaging, well structured, very well made and credible. It is a pearl, even counting that the levels are a bit ""rigid"".
The only problem is the save system: it is too rigid and we will repeat the same actions more and more to go ahead in the story. And this is a little frustrating and boring.
For the rest: I really like both the graphics and the stages, full of atmosphere. Our character is well animated. Physics has been compared to that of Boneworks. It is actually a much better compromise. Unlike Boneworks in TWDS&S there is a feeling that everything has its own weight and inertia without however excessive and unpleasant effects that makes the gaming experience frustrating, nauseating or cumbersome, as sometimes I happened to notice with Boneworks. The sound is fantastic. The radio in the bus (our base) broadcasts music that I would like to have as a playlist. Sound effects have something familiar (sometime reminds me to BioShock, I don't know why) and pleasant. 

The story is well articulated, convincing and engaging, also thanks to the strong characterization of the NPCs we interact with. Managing resources is pleasant, because our backpack is not the usual Mary Poppins bag, bottomless, but can only contain a certain number of objects. Slowly VR is collecting a number of titles capable of holding the comparison with the best AAA non-VR games. And i’m happy and grateful.","Feb 12, 2020 at 2:09 PM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 18:18:42.229053,SouthPawVR,My favorite 'Made for VR' game to date,"Saints and Sinners is an excellent mix of story and combat. The story is engaging and forces you to make hard decisions like you would expect to in the zombie apocalypse. You feel instantly connected with some of the characters, and instantly hate others. 

Chopping off a zombies head or forcing your knife through their skull never gets old. Some of the guns feel a little wonky, but overall they feel great.

The way they handled the weight in this game is excellent as well. I even think they do most of the physics better than Boneworks. Everything just feels more polished.","Feb 25, 2020 at 11:04 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:18:42.248999,snaky116,"Fun at first, but lacks replay value","As a huge fan of the Walking Dead series, both the show and the TellTale Games, I was hyped for the release of a Walking Dead title coming to VR and bought it day one.  While the experience was fun in the moment, the game slowly became more tedious as I progressed.  This game shines quite heavily on its outstanding approach to melee weaponry, and differs from other games with similar mechanics.  When I pull a shiv out of a zombie's head, I'm not just going through the motions, I need to apply extra effort to get my weapon back.  The voice acting in this game was also phenominal, the voice actors really brought the characters to life!

Now, onto why I'm rating this game 3 stars, and it really pains me to do this but I was left rather unsattisfied in the end.  First and foremost is the scrapping mechanic.  If you want to level up your abilities, you need to be constantly looting around for junk scattered around the world, which is exactly what you would be expecting in this sort of game.  The problem I have with how this was done is that loot respawns everytime you revisit the same area.  Sure, loot starts to dwindle as days pass, but if I can loot the same house day after day, it's left me wondering why there are still any supplies in there at all if I've looted it the night before.  My progress on the world doesn't leave an imprint of what I've done, and I start losing a connection with the world I'm in.  This is especially true with how frequent zombies respawn.  Killing zombies does not feel rewarding, and I found myself just running through the levels towards late game.  

The flashlight on the chest needs a better angle, because I'm constantly having to hold it manually to see things right in front of me.  The story itself was short, and the ending feels unrewarding if you go the good guy route.  I would've liked to see more companionship afterwards instead of a ""kay bye!""  It makes the entire adventure seem pointless otherwise...","Feb 5, 2020 at 2:58 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 18:18:42.268945,TheJotunn,Another Cash Grab,"People are all hyped but wait a week for reviews to start dropping on this game. When you really get into it, the game design is very flawed. The combat is fun and, short of some games like boneworks, hellsplit, and blade and sorcery, it has some of the best melee combat I've seen.

Where it fails is literally everywhere else. The level design is boring and dull. Too much grey darkness to hide the cartoony graphics and too little interaction with the world. Yay, I can pick up the pre-gened bottle off the ground and break it and stab a couple (literally two) zombies with it before it breaks. That's nice. But those things don't respawn and you'll find yourself running back through empty streets with terribly respawning zombies. For instance, I turned around and broke LOS with a wide-open area 20 feet away from me, turned around 1/2 a second later, and there was just a zombie standing right in the open where he clearly just popped into existance as soon as I turned my head. The model of the zombie I just killed was laying on the ground in the exact same spot. My thought wasn't ""cool, more fun combat"" or ""haha funny respawn mechanic"" it was ""oh, great, another durability knock to my one and only shiv that I have left in a way to artificially create difficulty"".

And I'm not bad with resource management and I don't get hit much, but the 2nd level of the game forces you to fight a seemingly endless stream of gun-toting humans while you still have very little and just really took your first bite of the game. The pacing, mechanics, and resource management kill and fun I was having crawling through decrepit houses and stabbing zombies in the face.

For the life of me, I don't even know if I'll be able to bring myself to finish this game. I'll try, but it seems more trouble than it's worth at this point. Lots of reaching over the left shoulder for inventory management and scrambling around for wine bottles that don't respawn. The game actually punishes you for playing it.","Jan 29, 2020 at 10:06 AM",2, 4,

It's truly a great immersive experience and it shows the developers have put plenty of time and effort to try and get a realistic experience - from weapons breaking to being able to break a glass bottle and use it as a stabbing weapon to the need to really push your shiv all the way through a zombie's skull and then pull it out.
The crafting/upgrade system makes you want to come back to the game to see what else you can get
Another really nice touch is the sense of time running out - whether each day light running out and you need to avoid being outside when it's dark or the fact that with each passing day you have less resources available and more zombies, nice realistic touch

The combat is a blast. Dismemberment? Sure. True death by braining through the skull with a shiv? Can do. Decapitation? You betcha. Gun play? Enough to easily satisfy.

The physical crouching and sneaking around is a very nice touch. Especially adding in voice immersion where you can whistle to a walker and it will turn around and look your way. Throwing glass bottles to lure the dead away from certain areas that you require access. Lots of cool stuff like this that you can just experiment with.

The quests are interesting and as the title implies, you can be a Saint or a Sinner. Your decisions in undead New Orleans have consequences.

I restarted from scratch. Totaly worth it, played through with no problems. Really awesome story. This is my new favorite Oculus game and I've played a lot of them. This is how great VR is done. I can't wait for the next Walking Dead game. I will buy the DLC pack and play through again soon.","Feb 16, 2020 at 1:07 AM",5, 0,

The only dissapointment I have is that the story is so short. It only took me 6 1/2 hours to complete the story, and I thought I was taking my time. For $40bucks I was expecting more. For the same price Asgard's wrath offers around 30 hours. I am also pretty new to VR games and might have to set my expectations a bit lower until the industry catches up. After beating the main story I am not really wanting to go back and just ""survive"" day after day with no goal.

The only reason this game doesn't have 5 stars is because you have to press a button to crouch and you can't just crouch in person and it kind of is an immersion breaker. I wish that you could press the button or crouch naturally so the gamer can choose based on comfort. Also, we need to be able to push buttons by touching them insteasd of having to push buttons on the controller. Also, if a friend could join my worlkd or I could join theirs it would be amaizing!

Yes, even more so than Asgard’s Wrath which is also AAA but feels more like a PC RPG in FPV.

2022-05-28 18:18:58.253193,Kevin_Brook,"Good, but in need of a patch.(Fixed!)","First impressions based on an hour of gameplay. The game is good, dark, foreboding atmosphere, excellent zombie kills and weapons mechanics, looks like lots of exploration and crafting to uncover. Definitely a game to sink your teeth into, whilst avoiding have walkers do the same to you! But there are some maddening, and frankly baffling design choices that really get in the way of enjoying the game. The game is constantly tripping over itself due to these silly and unnecessary reasons. I;'ll list here in the hope the developers see and others agree.
1) No crouch. Seriously. A 2020 VR game that acts like its made for a 3DOF Oculus Go. If you physically crouch the screen moves with you, like wtf? Can we have a true 6DOF experience like every freaking other VR game please.
2) Absurd stamina system. Does my character have COPD and asthma? Why can he not run for more than 3 seconds without wheezing and coming to a standstill? I want to feel like Rick Grimes not Hurley from Lost.
3) The diary is ace, and I love the tabs. But why do I have to both touch them with my finger, and at the same time press a button? Just let me touch it with my finger. This dev seems obsessed with using button presses instead of allowing us to use our bodies like we are, you know, playing a virtual reality game.
I don't want to give the impression the game is bad, it seems great so far, but these design choices really take me out of the experience and seem so pointless and unnecessary. Hopefully they can be fixed and the game will be a 5 star title.","Feb 11, 2020 at 4:26 AM",5, 0,

Taking cues from Boneworks every action you make in the game has a real weight and heft to it. When you pick up a spiked bat to smash a zombies face in you literally feel like you're using your whole body movement to strike the zombie exactly as you would in real life. The level of realism to every motion really helps pull you into the world of The Walking Dead. This is the kind of experience I always dreamed of playing in VR and I have to commend the developers for crafting such a well realized world with a truly fantastic story, world and most of all gameplay.

You really can't go blasting your way, and you really have to be sure to avoid zombies as much as possible or mainly rely on melee weapons.

Not only is it the best zombie game, but one of the best games I have played on VR in the past two years.  It really gives you the feeling of being in the Walking Dead universe.  The graphics are great and the game play is fun and fairly intuitive.  I think this is the beginning of the next stage of VR games.  I think one of the best things about this game is you can tell the devs really cared about the product and wanted to create an amazing experience.  It only took them two days to add a crouch feature asked for by the community.  That shows they care.  I think the only thing to make this a perfect game would be multiplayer down the line.  Co-op or even Reclaimed vs. Tower pvp would be a fantastic addition.  I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys VR as it is one of the best so far.","Feb 8, 2020 at 11:40 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:19:07.801654,SCO.Viper,Absolute Immersion.,"Just read the reviews.  You'll see I'm not the only one that thinks this is the best VR experience I've gotten the honor to try.

The story:  As you'd expect of a big name like The Walking Dead, there is an immersive story you can really sink yourself into.  You feel like you are in the boots of this character in the true Walking Dead comic universe. If you love the dark horror, post-apocalyptic world of the Walking Dead, this is a must have.

But it doesn't end there.

The physics:  Friction on textures, weight, collisions etc. are simulated with realism.  You can practically feel these objects, in a manner I've only seen done in Boneworks and Blade and Sorcery before.  In my opinion, this Walking Dead game feels even better than both of those games, in terms of these special physics. And despite all this, the performance and graphics can run incredibly well. I have not felt any stuttering or experienced any strange physics events that break immersion, such as in Boneworks where your hands can get stuck behind solid objects, twitching entities etc.

And another thing to top it off is that the developers listen to the community.  When this game is released there were things people were not happy with, features such as physical crouch were missing.  Upon seeing these reviews of the game, the devs patched in a physical crouching function within a few days!  Incredible.

Just get the game if the story interests you. You will love it, I swear.
This surely set a high bar in the industry.  I'm definitely looking forward to seeing future AAA VR titles.","Feb 2, 2020 at 4:50 AM",5, 3,

Quick note: I had a rough time trying to get the game to install, if you run into this issue it means you have to update windows & disable antivirus software. Oculus staff helped me get the game going, much obliged! 

Another quick update: I'm experiencing strange bugs, like sometimes I'm half a foot tall and other times I'm 3 feet tall. Still a head shorter than NPCs. I have found that if I hold up to a table or something like that I can make myself taller again (within reason) (lol)

This game reminds me of the good the bad and the ugly. The good is that it's an interesting exploring game, I'm on my 3rd location and can't wait to see more. Stabbing zombies is fun, I haven't gotten to the axe yet. The progression system is fun too, remings me of Asgard's wrath in a way. I look forwards to progressing. 

The bad: I feel like I'm only 4 feet tall constantly, not sure how to change the game height. A bit buggy, sometimes I end up on the floor. When I shoot my gun  it seems to miss more than it should. This game is very motion sicky, I feel like Asguard's wrath did a lot better in this regard for some reason.

The ugly: I get the cartoonish aesthetic but some of the people look downright nasty. Some even worse than skyrim! 

Between this game and Asguard's wrath, if you have to go with one or the other, I'd go Asguard's wrath. Asguard's wrath VR implematation is better IMO, and it's very pretty to look at. I will say this game provides a good juxtaposition though, very gloomy kind of like Fallout 4 VR, but in a good way. I'm not a big fan of the going from puzzle to puzzle in Asguard's wrath and the combat is a bit confusing;  so I do enjoy this game for it's more organic approach to solving puzzles and objectives... so in that regard I do prefer the gameplay.","Feb 10, 2020 at 2:12 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:19:07.863489,TheWishblade,The definitive Walking Dead experience,"At first, I was a bit hesitant due to select few issues, like crouching being a button press. Then I decided to dive in and give it a shot, because I was too intrigued.

Let's get some of the meh out of the way:
1. I crashed about 4 times from beginning to end, having spent a fair bit of time collecting secret recipes along the way.

And that's really the one big flaw I had. Beyond that, the crouching felt fine to me, but I can understand why some would think it ridiculous in a VR game.

So, the good stuff!
1. Immersion was spot on! In just about everything I did, from scavenging supplies to fighting either walkers or people, it felt like this is some serious survivalist work at play.
2. Gameplay was great! From moving about to using weapons, especially weapons! While I do feel there's a bit of assistance in aiming ranged weapons, which helped me out a decent bit, being a good shot felt so rewarding. But that satisfaction of driving a weapon into the enemy's head... At the risk of sounding psychotic: Delicious!
3. Crafting was fun. It was pretty cool to hunt down specific items to get the upgrades you wanted. Granted, once all the stations are up and running, it truly becomes a matter of just grabbing stuff, because you'll have what you need. But regardless, felt good and the stuff you could make was awesome.
4. Story was great. Somewhat run of the mill in such a scenario but I loved moving forward and getting ready to reach that ultimate reward while helping out the people around me. And as you'd expect, sometimes you must make some choices to survive, but you'll see for yourself.

Anyway, I think that's plenty from me. Hopefully with a bit of patching, the crashes won't happen, or it's just my machine's fault. But other than that, get it, complete it, enjoy it! Might feel a bit repetitive, might feel a bit slow and dangerous, but once the momentum picks up, you'll become unstoppable!","Feb 4, 2020 at 7:31 PM",5, 1,

I was blown away, reeling from the experience and thinking about how to survive my next outing. You really feel like you are there sometimes!

The stats system needs work. Expect to play at half max health for most of the game and not be able to run for more than a few seconds. Never venture out without backup weapons, they will break at the worst possible moment. Some only last for a couple kills. The further you unlock, the better they get.

You can have up to 3 different profiles with around 10 save slots each. You operate out of a safe area, traveling to one dangerous location per in-game day. Most saves are triggered only when sleeping in your safe area. You have a journal and flash light with you at all times. The journal offers on-the-fly access to your inventory, map with locator, other information about items you've found, and tasks which are your objectives towards completing the game. You collect supplies during your outings to scrap for materials. You unlock additional items by spending materials to upgrade your three different crafting tables; survival items, guns and gear. I completed it in 17h, but I spent several extra hours looking for notes to unlock secret items. I unlocked all but 3 of them my first play through. 

The hidden safe codes are different for each profile, although the notes themselves will be in the same spots.

My experience hasn't been 100% perfect.. occasionally my arms will just lock up at my waist and I cant move them. This may actually be an issue with my Oculus Rift S, or my host PC, but I have to restart to resolve the issue and I lose progress for the Day... imagine trying to fend off a zombie with no arms!

There are several easter eggs and hidden surprises! I unlocked around half of the items about 10h into it, but I was fully exploring everything... I definitely experience heightened emotions when I fail.","Feb 5, 2020 at 9:56 AM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 18:19:14.192561,Glitch Fandango,"Absolutely brilliant, just not for me","This is a weird review to write, because it’s both a 5* and a 3* review at the same time. Hear me out...

This game is technically amazing. The graphics, audio, physics, immersion and story are all thoughtfully crafted and expertly delivered. My first hour in this game I was just blown away by how well the devs had done delivering something so truly remarkable. 

The gameplay is designed to keep you always on edge and makes sure that each decision you make is thought through. The stakes at every turn are high and the fear and anxiety this creates adds a layer to the immersion that I’ve not seen before. If you’re a fan of the survival horror genre, you’re going to love this. But...

I’m not personally a fan of the slow grind style of games and that’s where my trouble started. After the initial WOW wore off, I started to get bored very quickly. 

The concept of a stamina system is brilliant but the implementation here left me walking at a snails pace, tracking back and forward from points on the map unable to run lest my max stamina be reduced and I use precious resources to replenish. The starting stamina for your character is so ridiculously low that after taking 3 poorly judged swings at a zombie I was “too tired” to hold it, or to run, so basically just got munched.

Similarly the durability element of the weapons is another great concept, but for me just became frustrating. They just seemed too weak. Constantly diverting resources to have basic weapons got tiresome for me very quickly. 

Like with the point about stamina, it just took the fun out of playing the game being sooooooo completely underpowered from the beginning. Essentially you start the game as a geriatric with a lung condition who is armed with weapons made of Lego.

For me it felt as if the difficulty bar was set just a little too high. You can upgrade so many things to improve your character, but between the incredibly slow walk speed and limited back pack slots, everything just feels like it takes so long to do that. 

If there was a difficulty setting in this that started you with a bigger backpack, bigger stamina and more durable weapons from the offset I would probably enjoy this game much more.

TLDR: 5* for the game itself, 3* for how much I personally enjoyed it. But you should definitely give it a try, it’s phenomenally well done. Just know that if you want a bit more of an action game you may want to wait for TWD: Onslaught","Feb 6, 2020 at 8:58 PM",4, 1,

This is a survival horror of epic proportions. It is anxiety inducing, tense, tactical and tough. It is also very fulfilling, it gives you a real sense of achievment as you progress. 
I've a couple of gripes,  no crouch (button crouch) and floating when you try to grab bodies is bit weird but minor and will likely soon be ironed out.  All in all an amazing AAA survival horror. 
I am very interested to see how this ports to quest in a few months...

Looting and inventory management reminds me of Resident Evil and ZombiU but in a good way. You can hold 30 items (27 items in the bag, 2 on the hips, and 1 over the shoulder). Items and weapons have weight to them which is an interesting change to the usual VR experience. You can craft weapons, upgrades, food, and healing items.

We thought we had the right description in place. Localization will ship at a later date. Sorry for the inconvenience.
2022-05-28 18:19:20.595436,Chris_Stacey,So close to perfect..!,"TLDR: Almost perfect, but not without a flaw. Thumbs up!

This game is genuinely scary (despite the stylised character graphics) but amazing fun to explore! Gore is high. 

It involves crafting and resource management; building tools and creating supplies to keep your arsenal stocked and food in the cupboards. 

Combat is very violent with accurate physics, requiring you to push that little bit harder to stab a screwdriver through a walker's skull. 
Missions are played in a day - a timer on your watch tells you when night will fall and zombies will start to horde on you. Your stamina and health are reliant on food, medicine and rest. It can be brutal though, as running and swinging weapons drains stamina quickly... and then you die.

This would be a perfect VR game - and probably my favourite game - if your position was no so locked in place. Some interactions require a button click, whereas others are physical actions. You cannot physically crouch and have it simulated, you have to toggle a button to crouch in game... 
This sorely needs to be changed by the developers. 
Having very recently played Boneworks and had so much (perhaps too much) physic[s]al movement, this feels disorienting and strange.  Wilson's Heart is similarly restricted, but it makes more sense in the narrative nature of that experience. When playing Skyrim VR, I enjoy leaving a dungeon and lying down on a grassy mountain... 
The opening cut scene has you stood on a row boat floating through New Orleans witnessing the apocalypse - but I couldn't sit down in the boat (as you would IRL) without pressing a button and then sitting down! 
I do wonder if these are deliberate choices on the part of the developers to make an excruciatingly violent and frightening experience feel more like a video game(?) Hopefully a patch in the near future - please?!

All in all, a very good game. Going back now to play some more!

EDIT: 28/01/20 Just tried the update/workaround to allow crouching in game. It's sooo much better (although not without some glitches)! Hopefully this will be fully implemented soon - maybe it was an outstanding item on the to-do list at launch?","Jan 28, 2020 at 8:02 PM",4, 4,

Game is well optimized.

Yes, can t crouch in real time but by pressing button touch, but their actually a feature in the alpha, and in inself, it s not a big probleme who can make me jump out a star, when you play the walking dead sinns and the sinners, before all, you feel you play a quality game.

I am super glad that physical crouching was added for those who wanted it but instead of making it an option in the settings you made us hack the game to turn it off. While you did tell us the line of code to change, you did not provide the location of the .ini for doing so. I finally discovered that you provided the location to those who wanted physical crouching in the last patch but I shouldn't have to search through patch notes to make my game playable again.

Game phisics works great and you get quickly inmersed in the environment... zombies are pretty easy to kill, at first, then you didn't noticed that bitter crawling behind you, then you ran in panic and rush into a bigger group of skinnies, and then you admit that sooner or later, you'll be walking amongst them...
What I love most is the very good optimization the game seems to have... just like if developers tryed not to overload resources in order to be able to make better ports to other platforms.

I would stray to say that this is one of the best vr titles out right now, the walker combat is really fluid and it gives you a since of ergency to kill one before going on to the next. I liked the fact that the knife didnt always go straight into the zombie and you had to use a bit of force to do so. As far as the story goes without giving any spoilers, it was overall okay, it wasnt anything new but it did go along with the comic book, you get a choice in the end, but some of the missions did feel a bit monotenous, like the missions for May. This wasn't a complete loss though, i enjoyed reading and HEARING (very benifitial.....sometimes) - the reading would get in the way of characters talking in game and confuse me at times - and overall enjoyed the game as a whole. 
The game took me 13 hours to complete, on a 20 day period in game. The game wasnt difficult but challenging enough to be entertaining. If you dont like survival games this is obviously not for you, but if you have the money to throw at it, its a good bit of fun just to mess around in. The game lets you continue playing after you finish which is a plus and adds replayability. 
Things I wish were different: Please add real life crouching in the game, it was one of the things that let me down on the game. The combat with fighting people wasnt amazing but It isnt a game about that so it wasnt game breaking. I also wish you could light matches and have smoke come from cigerettes, i feel like its something that should be ready to go when you put it into a game, or at least just dont put it in the game in the first place. lastly maybe lighting settings, even with the torch/flashlight i couldnt see in some of the dark hallways at all, i get the atmosphere you were going for but a little more visibility wouldve been helpful.

3. please learn how normal people hold door knobs, also all doors do not have knobs, most have handles.
4. if i try to grab something i dont want to cling to a wall and plane myself along. it looks like echo but we are not in 0 grav.
5. limited space for taking stuff home. you best believe i would be filling my raft to the brim when zombies hit. everything has a use.

This is only a top rated game because the VR scene is full of independent developers games and experiences. If this was a console game I would rate it even lower.

My Initial Thoughts:
Having not watched any lets plays or reviews I went into this game blind, not knowing what to expect and boy what a surprise.
I thought this was going to be another generic zombie shooter, but instead it turns into an amazing RPG based on the Walking Dead series, and its fantastic so far.
It's really easy to die in this game if you don't have the appropriate weapons and at times I was having to cower and hide from the zombies. 
You can become really paranoid with no weapons, and that's something I have not felt in a VR game before.

Pros 
Nice art style
Plenty of weapons
Items for scavenging aren't too scarce
Melee physics are GOAT 
The bat makes me feel like negan

Cons
I would like to save in the rest area without sleeping or travelling to a different place
NPC's have some work needed: the animations are minimal and they forget who you are seconds after you help them.
Aiming weapons doesn't work like it should with the physics they have integrated: the ""weighty"" feel is nice but doesn't work so well when aiming.
Audio for firearms sounds like a DS game
Performance is rocky but might be due to oculus link
Sometimes when storing a weapon on your side you'll miss the holster and drop the weapon without realizing it.
The timing on the watch (clock tower) makes you want to not explore and leave the map as soon as you can

3. Ability to disable sound cues for being spotted by zombies.

1. Food and medicine audio can bug when putting to ones mouth, as well as prevent you from using them when you should be able to. (This is also the case with the flask for sleeping.)

Best game made so far for virtual reality in my opinion. Liked this way more than AW. All the mechanics are so well done and intricate. You really feel like your trying to survive the apocalypse, with limited resources and weapons breaking. Zombies are terrifying when your indoors and clearing the rooms one by one. Zombies outside don't give me much issues as I feel like I can see everyone, but the feeling that any time you're indoor a zombie can pounce you is terrifying, yet something keeps me soldiering on and checking all the rooms until my backback is full, after that I bolt fast. You can't take too long either since the bell will start to ring after while and hordes of zombies will arrive. Love this game! Definitely worth the purchase and the developers deserve all the support. Also the devs confirmed that it will be a cross-buy for the quest, which is bloody awesome! Haven't even finished the game and I'm already longing for a DLC! Keep up the good work!","Jan 25, 2020 at 1:56 AM",5, 2,So great to hear that you liked the game! It took a lot of blood sweat and tears but it's all worth it seeing how much fun you are having with it.
2022-05-28 18:19:42.835950,1vraccount1,Great fun but there are a few problems,"First off the game looks awsome and is really fun to play, but there are a few problems to the game in its current state.
 
You can't crouch in real life but have to press a button. Now it's not a problem gameplay wise but it can be a let down with impression.

Walkers can spawn just about anywhere you are not looking. I have had some walkers spawn behind me when I was in the streets right when I turn my head around. While this is not a huge problem but it can wear down weapons rather quickly, which can be a problem if you come across a large number of walkers and you just ran out of durability on all of your weapons.

Now I don't know if this is just happening to me or if it is a bug but I can't seem to advance to day 4. Whenever I try to drink from the flask to go to the next day, I am met with the consumption bar just not filling up. I thought it might just be for the flash but I tried it on soda but I was met with the same result. I tried restart the day and even when to a different area but I still could not advance to day 4.

Can't be played well if you are left handed. You have to aim and move with the same hand which can be a bit of a pain when using a gun. So if you play this left handed you might have to stay still to use weapons unless you can somehow manage that.","Jan 24, 2020 at 10:00 AM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 18:19:42.857892,KitsuneFoxed,A very good game!,"This has to the one of the best games ive played in vr so far. It has everything lots of games lack like good physics, interactive gunplay, and nice atmosphere. 

There are a few things i wish they could add and a few ideas id like to see. One of which is the flashlight. (The school level terrifies me) i wish there were two levels of light and depending on what one you use the slower/quicker your light runs out. Maybe have a brighter mode and a bit bigger of an angle for the light (having to hold the journal slightly left in dark areas is weird). Co-op and pvp obviously would be amazing in this game. Id also like some on the go crafting. Maybe if you have two items you hold them together to make something. Another thing that gets annoying is the slow walking. I wish the walk speed was slightly faster but i can see where it plays in for zombies catching you if youre low on stamina. Another thing is melee pve, id love to have a fight against people with axes and bats with deflecting attacks and swinging at openings. One last thing is i wish there were more side quests. The main story is amazing but after i beat the game i wished there was more to do with people other than being mugged.

Out of minor nitpicking i think this is a step in the right direction for the future of vr. I really enjoy this game and i think the devs did a nice job bringing us into the world of the walking dead. I look forward to future updates and i will be constantly replaying this game. Amazing job team! Keep it up!","Jan 30, 2020 at 4:03 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 18:19:42.900777,Slipknotmaggot44,The best VR Zombie game hands down!,"Edit after recent update!

This game has everything you'd want from a Walking dead themed survival horror game. You have to scavenge for food and rescources to survive requiring you to venture out into the world. There are 3 different crafting trees that use a large variety of rescources, combined with a reasonable but limited bag space you will need to prioritze what to scavenge everytime you are exploring.  You also have a stamina/hunger system, which depletes quickly from swinging weapons, sprinting, and vaulting/climbing objects. Not being careful with your stamina while fighting and avoiding the undead will lead to a quick death as you will be unable to fight them off or get away if you tire out. Your max satmina also decreases untill you are able to find food and replenish it.

    There are many more great things I could say about this game, especially regarding the spot on physics, but honestly I recommend just purchasing this game and seeing for yourself. This is the new Gold Standard for a true AAA survival horror experience and for VR in general. This game is worth every penny.

Edited portion: Devs are very responsive to feedback and fixed the previous issues I was encountering. I have also progressed farther into the game and would like to add the difficulty ramps up with each day you survive. You really get the feel that you are scraping by to survive and its great!

   
Overall I'd personaly rate this game a 10/10 and would recommend this to anyone with a VR headset!","Jan 26, 2020 at 12:12 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:19:42.922718,lXeleXl,excellent game,"The  melee mechanics are a breath of fresh air, arguably the thing that sets this game apart. With that however, the gun mechanics seem like an after thought, aiming is janky, and the weight mechanics of the shotgun actually made it droop off its axis to the point where during a hoard encounter, i couldnt grab it with my other hand since the barrel drifted way out of reach from where i was pointing.
There is an unnecessary lack of durability in the weapons, guns can barely survive a firefight which yes it may make planning more critical but ultimately it just makes me unable to combat the AI that has unlimited ammo and gun durability and removes the option to be aggressive. It would be nice to get a repair option, I hate scrapping guns because i cant build them up or maintain/ mod them. Fixing durability, fixing the stamina issue, adding more honest gun implementation and perhaps a 2 person multiplayer option would really solidify this game as one of the best on vr atm.","Jan 24, 2020 at 2:33 PM",5, 2,

The game can actually make you completely forget about reality and scare the doughnuts* out of you, making you question if you have the courage to continue playing through the next level.

They have addressed several concerns (including the physical crouching issue) after not even a week since release. (look at the updates section and follow their instructions on how to enable physical crouching -in alpha at the time of writing-)

2022-05-28 18:19:46.086257,KingDGB,Very good so far,"I'm about 2 hours in and so far I'd say this is the best VR game I've played. The graphics are VERY good and run smoothly on my 2070 Super rig at Ultra 150% Pixel Density on the CV1. 

Overall, the combat is enjoyable, it has some cool features, maybe nothing revoluationary, but really really solid. The crafting is also awesome. 

Another reviewer complained about the stamina system. I have to disagree, I think it's awesome. It makes you think, you always need food and bandages and you need to be smart, it's a survival game after all. 

That being said, the same reviewer mentioned that touch controls could be utilized better and I agree. I think there are some places where button presses would not normally be necessary, but it isn't that hard to get used to. I.e. there is a built in crouch in game. This game doesn't make you bend over constatly, because you would be doing it ALOT. 

If you want a story driven, very polished, VR game set in TWD universe then this is the game to go with. Just seing NOLA built out is so awesome.","Jan 26, 2020 at 2:08 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:19:46.109196,Ryan606Rev,Not in library: Fixed,"Original: Purchased but not available for download.

Update: Item became available to download after an hour or so.

Very impressed so far. Very high quality environment and animations for a VR game. It reminds me of the quality of an Oculus Studios title. Definitely the next big premium VR title.

Stamina feature is a bit annoying  since it seems to be more important than health. You use it to run, attack, and survive getting grabbed by walkers. Regaining the stamina is a be tricking since you have to get your bag out. You get to go to one location each day to gather supplies and complete mission objectives. Each day there are more walkers and fewer resources. Crafting seems interesting enough with three categoes and many tiers of unlocks.

Finished the game, update 2: Overall I find two areas lacking. First is the disregard for the precise one to one tracking offered while playing in VR. The stamina system hurts this feeling with your in game representation being suggish and imprecise when low on stamina. Early on this happens a lot and gave a mixed first impression but if you dont stay out until the horde then this shouldnt be a problem. Second, there isnt enough interaction with other survivors and factions. There are two NPCs who give you missions and two factions. You cannot join the factions. There is no alignment. It felt like this game was marketed toward you being able to choose sides and help alot of survivors and do side missions. You make a handful of choices but mostly just fetch, and the fetching makes you violate faction safe houses even if you would have wanted to align with that faction. I finished the game around day 24 and at that point I had been done with all three tech trees for about ten days. It seems as though you will not even get all of the crafting recipies if you make certain decisions so beware. The overall art and game design shine though the annoyances with the stamina system and lack of content outside of roughly 8-10 missions.","Jan 31, 2020 at 10:52 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:19:49.229850,Gibbonici,Amazing with a few flaws,"This game is a great VR experience, it really does set the bar higher for VR games.   Everything in the game feels solid, from the environments to the objects you can pick up and interact with to the zombies themselves. The combat feels just right, especially the melee - you really have to shove that shiv hard into the skull to kill zombies, and then you really have to pull it out again.

The environments are detailed and well presented, with loads of objects to pick up and use. One of my favourite moments so far was being chased around a room by a zombie, grabbing a bottle, smashing it against a wall then using to kill the zombie. 

I could go on with the positives, but there are so many I'll just repeat what I said above - it sets a new standard for VR games.

It's not without it's flaws though, and I hope the devs fix them (they seem very responsive so far, so maybe we'll be lucky!).

There's no physical crouch, instead there's a button for it. I understand there's a work-in-progress version of physical crouching in the latest update, but it really needs to be in the game proper. I don't actually mind the button crouch, but it would be good to have both options.

The stamina system is a bit over the top. You can't run for very long and getting into a fight with two or more zombies, even with single-handed weapons, is going to tire you out pretty much to death. I really hope this is tweaked upwards - it breaks you out of the experience a bit when your character gets tired quicker than you do.

Zombies seem to respawn. I don't mind this happening between days, but when you've killed a zombie in a yard, it shouldn't be back after you've just been going through your inventory. If you've cleared a room or a house or a yard, you should be safe there. It's just part of the zombie survival thing.

Even with these flaws the game is great. It would be an easy 5 stars without them though.","Jan 26, 2020 at 11:11 PM",4, 2,

What also impressed me is the actual locomotion employed within the game which works so well that you never feel like you are off balance like you do in Doom VFR's implementation.  

Looking forward to spending more time in this world now, very very impressed.

Oculus link performance is great however maybe it's a compression issue with the quest but some of the onscreen prompts are hard to read due to being so far off center. While certainly not deal breaker being able to physically crouch would complete the sense of immersion. Lastly when crouching the hud that displays can be very distracting especially in darker environments. If some of these quality of life features get implemented I would hands down give this game 5 stars, regardless this is still a fantastic game and VR needs more quality titles such as this.

My god, I actually stopped and took a break washing dishes out of sheer boredom within my first hour.  That has never happened to me in a VR game before.  I could understand when you're sneaking, but even your default walk speed is just......so....slow.  And sure, can sprint, but it tanks your stamina insanely fast.  I'm honestly not sure if I have the patience to slog through this, and I'm on the fence about whether or not to just get a refund before I hit the point of no return on hours played.
The crafting system is interesting, your holsters and inventory are easy to use and intuitive, but the problem is when you're trying to grab items off the ground, half the time you inadvertently draw your weapon out of your holster instead.  I've lost a couple perfectly good knives that way somewhere along the line.
Weapons handle realistically.  No waggle-fighting here, you have to grip that axe with both hands and your strike had better be on point.  That was very well done, as is the gunplay.  (Which, given the oversaturation of shooters and arena fighters that have set standards of both great and terrible combat, shoddy weapon handling would just be unforgivable at this point.)
So yeah.  It's got potential, but that walk speed...UGH I can't stand it.  If you've ever played Skyrim or Fallout, you know how when you're overburdened you walk at that agonizingly slow pace?  Imagine that...but that's your default.  That's your normal speed, all the time.  That really needs to be amped up by at LEAST twice.

For the issues; just the equiping and reloading mechanics. There are seven places to grab items off your body. They don't track perfectly (Rift S) I'm sure there will be a few patches that correct this so I'm not too worried.

2022-05-28 18:20:05.209111,Honosuseri,The VR Zombie game we've always wanted,"Day 20...Available supplies have dwindled. The Dead have grown in number!
Having put some time into the game and unlocked some nice toys to tinker with, I felt I was ready to leave some feedback...

Really enjoying the WD:S&S experience. A nice range of weapons to use, with firearms having different reload mechanics. Weapons and items have ""virtual weight"" to them in game, takes getting used to but adds to the immersion. You must balance your resources and stamina (especially when climbing!). The more you take with you from ""the hub"", the less space you have to store scavenged stuff to bring back ""home"". This ""Junk"" can then be recycled giving you resources to upgrade your workbenches, making more items and abilities available.

To survive you need to adapt your tactics. Early on you can rely on sneaking up and ""braining"" zombies. Smash a bottle over their heads and then stab them, or use that Kitchen knife from the house you were just in. That'll soon change and you need to think on your feet, to get the best of the undead...the living too!

Those reviews complaining you can't crouch IRL, a patch has already been released. Check the release notes for the ini file to edit, to test the feature until they are happy with the mechanic and put it in game proper.","Jan 26, 2020 at 9:08 AM",4, 0,

However (Stephen A Smith voice) the arms are buggy when rotating, there is no manual crouch and there is some delay when trying to aim quickly. There’s no way to know how much ammo is left in your gun at any time visually. You could count bullets, but I don’t see a reason why that wouldn’t be an option.","Jan 25, 2020 at 2:19 AM",4, 1,
