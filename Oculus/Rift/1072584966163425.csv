2022-05-28 18:32:12.467471,Edautch,Has Bugs,"every few swings, the ball ends up 10 feet in front of me and since im not playing outside, i cant just walk over to it, it becomes a hit and miss series of switching the club from left to right hand and then zooming out and back in again to get me to the ball, makes the game almost un playable! if anyone has figured out a fix for this please let me know, and what happened to all the options? it seems it has been ruined by the update!","Feb 27, 2021 at 7:21 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 18:32:12.482431,SirRobinMAGYARFARKAS,I love it...:D,"I tried golf for 30 euros, mini golf for 10-15 euros, 
but this is the first one that resembles real golf! 
I hope there will be a quest version as well! 
Unfortunately, for 4 players, the server keeps shutting down,but everything is ok with 3 player...","Jan 21, 2021 at 4:05 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:32:12.497391,NorCalMarco,Horrible and buggy,"Requesting a refund.  Not at all like golf in any sense and constantly has you facing in the wrong direction or unable to reach the ball for your shot.  Just very aggravating.  Could have been a cute simple golf game but instead so far it's just a glitchy mess with lots of potential but, to me, not worth trying a third time.","Jun 19, 2020 at 2:09 PM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 18:32:12.511353,dreadnbutter,Much better w/Rift S since last update,"You still have to reset your position by trigger+up joystick , then back down again ,  on putting green, but overall, very much improved on Rift S.  Also, I didn't notice before, maybe it was there all along ? But the ability to turn on one controller and use one helps greately.  This is noted on 2nd page of help menu.","May 6, 2020 at 2:23 AM",4, 3,
