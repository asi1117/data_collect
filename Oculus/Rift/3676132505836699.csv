People start on you for no reason and it takes 5 mins to knock them out by which time the cops have sided with them and robbed you of all the money you made digging through the trash looking for wallets its like a busty girl in a wonderbra looks good till you to play and discover its so shallow and lacking you have to try hard to drown in it. Note to devs flesh out the game make it fun to play and i will sing prases of your game and campaign my friends and family that it is a VR must have along with Halflife: Alyx , The Walking Dead Saints And Sinners, Boneworks and Zenith : the last city.",Jan 29 at 2:42 AM,1, 10,

The game looks amazing and the fighting looks super cool. My boy had a ton of fun. Looking forward to any expansions or sequels. Really cannot wait.",Jan 4 at 5:03 PM,5, 18,
