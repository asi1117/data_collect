We are sorry you didn't enjoy our game. To help you have a better experience you can use the no guardian option in the settings menu so you don't have to use a big room to play, you can even play seated if you wish by creating your own borders and just move around by teleporting using your controller :)

The main goal of our game is to defeat the hidden boss. In order to find him, you have to explore systems and it will add points to your Clue-O-Meter (on the left of the navigation panel). Once it is full, you can warp to the boss system and destroy his ship. It seems you have encountered a bug with the menu button, we will invistigate further and patch it as soon as possible as we are still in Alpha.

We hope you will give it another try and if you need any help, do not hesitate to contact us."
