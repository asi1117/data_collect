2022-05-28 19:45:13.038322,FastLawyer,Horror endless runner,"So VR has lots of wave shooters.  And it also has lots of endless runners.  Most endless runners are absolutely not fun to play at all.  However, this game is pretty fun.  It honestly has some of the better graphics for an endless runner (upper echelon for endless runner, but below average for most VR title types).  The gameplay is simple.  Tilt your head left or right to avoid hitting obstacles or to pickup items.  You can upgrade your bike based on how far you travel.  The better your bike, the easier it is to get farther.  The farther you get, the more difficult the game gets.  It says story mode but I'm not seeing any story.  I only paid .99 cents and I had fun.  This is good for cheap Halloween scares.  Harmless enough that you can even let kids or grandma play it ... as long as they don't look behind them.","Mar 31, 2018 at 12:06 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:45:13.053282,Metalsech,Basic But Fun,It's essentially a randomised autorunner very much like Into The Dead although a lot darker and without the weapons. Spooky though undetailed visuals and a fun concept,"Sep 29, 2017 at 7:37 AM",4, 2,
