2022-05-28 19:42:50.120275,Zabuza_Momochi,One of the best relaxing games,"You sit down throw on the vr head set after a long day of work and hop into this game. It takes you to a beautiful room with the pottery throwing wheel that you will come to learn and love. You will make pottery for hrs and each hr you will get better and better till you smile and say ""I made that"" and place it on a shelf. This game is beautiful and simple and is worth the money. If you want to relax buy this game, if you want to work hard to get good at something in vr also buy this game! WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!","Feb 21, 2020 at 4:44 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:42:50.136226,Veiledsnow,I finally don't suck at pottery!,"I'm an artistic person. Just gonna start with that. So, this sounded very exciting since pottery was one of the few types of art that I can't do/don't have the budget for in real life. Plus, I think I'm just not good at pottery and sculpting in real life, considering that every time I'd tried at a studio, or something similar, it was not up to my standards.

BUT THIS GAME! Omg, I love it! It's very easy to use once you get the hang of what angle you have to approach the clay to get the hand position you want. I've played it for hours and still haven't finished the story mode! Actually, the story mode is sort of challenging (I got stuck shortly after entering the USA workshop), which I honestly wasn't expecting from such a laidback game. It was a pleasant surprise to find that even though it's a fun and relaxing game, it takes itself seriously and wants to challenge you a bit! 

I LOVE that you're able to put in your own designs/stamps and play your own music in the game via the radio you can buy. (Customization and personalization FTW!) And I also love that the radio was quite expensive and didn't already exist in your workshops, giving me something to work towards! (Though it took some fiddling with the config file to get it to work since my music isn't all in the one main ""Music"" folder, but subfolders within that folder, so the path was different than the default. In the end, I just made a subfolder in my Music folder where I copied over all my favorite songs (in mp3 format) and directed the config file to that folder, so I wouldn't have to copy over EVERYTHING to the main folder, nor sacrfice my organization.)

Some sort of guidance either in game or via directions in the online manual, about how to set that up would help a lot of people who don't have the ""normal"" Music Folder setup. Since I looked everywhere, and no one could tell me what to do, so I had to start using my gaming and computer knowledge, and guess- Messing around with files until it worked.","Jul 27, 2019 at 11:30 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:42:50.152183,Shyassasain,Very nice,"It's a peaceful little game about pottery.
Only problem is that it doesn't export properly, the textures are separate from the model, so it's a pointless feature right now. Would be nice if you could export in .GLB format so it can be imported directly to Oculus home.

The controls are also a bit finnicky, but they work very well. Also not sure how to use the bluetooth headphones for music?","Jan 9, 2019 at 8:12 PM",4, 7,"Thanks for the first review. :) 

Unfortunately we do not have any plans on the support of GLB file format yet. GLB file format is very limited for its usage and very brand new file format. If you can use 3D modeling software like Blender and maya with exported OBJ file and textures. - Unfortunately it's very difficult for most people. :(

Using in-game Bluetooth headphones is simple. If there is a Bluetooth speaker that is playing musics in the scene, you can wear the headphone and listen music via the headphone. To wear the headphone, pick up the headphone and drop into your HMD."
