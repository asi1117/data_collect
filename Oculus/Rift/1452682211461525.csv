However there needs to be more indication of damage on the zombies such as blood splatter and limbs coming off.  You should also get the option to reverse the layout as I want to shoot with my right hand and pick up drinks with my left hand, but the bar's to my right which makes that pretty awkward. Also the zombies come at you so fast you're basically firing non-stop which soon knackers your hand. Devs if you can slow things down a bit, allow player to choose the layout, maybe make it more tactical such as zombies that have specific weak points to aim at like House Of The Dead then this would be a lot better...","Sep 29, 2017 at 7:42 AM",3, 2,"Thank you Metalsech!
