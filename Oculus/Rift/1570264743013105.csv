2022-05-28 17:33:56.855465,The_Shepherd,View Issue...,Cockpit view sets you to the right of the driver seat(passenger) however it even does this on the bike so you are just floating next to it... makes steering difficult...,"Dec 27, 2019 at 11:11 AM",3, 29,

2022-05-28 17:34:00.028977,SpidyM,Excellent for a free game,"Takes a bit of time to work out the controls and get a feel for the game.... but a very nice original effort at something very different from the norm ( even for VR ) and once you have the hang of it ....its hard to put it down! There is a full price version of the game with loads more cards... but you still get a lot of game for free!

One thing Devs can you sort out the ""enter name"" part at present nothing happens ( no keyboard appears) Also keep the updates coming!","Sep 10, 2018 at 2:43 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 17:34:03.120708,Captain_Howdy,"it's nice .... on a phone, I think","The 1st tryI honestly didn't  have a clue how this game works
It all starts at the menu when you enter, you are presented with ""enter a name"" but no keyboard appears, so am i supposed to take of my headset and keep it aimed at the namefield in hope it will take keyboard input, i mean, i cant use the mouse because the controlers override it, i cant activate the name field with 
the controlers either
A great 1st impression, this is a true masterpiece, great care has been put in programming this ui

So i point at the button on the upper left corner and i end up on a dessert road
where again half the controls don't seem to do anything

Maybe some clarity in regards to what i am expected to do would be in order?
I can move fwd and back with left th stick, fwd I encounter 3 quesionmarks, they block the road, I can travel back 2 ""steps"" where I am blocked again

Dev, are you sure you didn't try to create a swing, or a rocking chair?

Imo from the little bit i have seen the video that ""sold"" the game is not a true represantation of the game, , there is no steering, the only controls are fwd and back

i am giving it 1 more try, and if i figure out how it all works i ll come back here, if not the single star stays

Ok 2 stars because it's really a game with a funny violently destructive video though it gets pretty boring pretty soon, I can imagine some people like weird kind of rts games, cuz that's what it resembles the most
I'd say give it a go, the free version, not the ""premium, surely not worth $19.99 not in 1999 years, more like $1.99 and then only out of curiousity about what could ever make it so much better to deserve premium status 

Btw, dev(s?) in the Rift the pov gets lower with every card played, until eye level is literally at ground level, and there it remains until you p,ay another card
I take it that you understand that this greatly reduces your view to the point that you only see vehicles when they('re about to} hit you","Sep 5, 2018 at 2:37 PM",2, 24,"Howdy Captain!
First of all thanks a lot for giving the game a try! We've had a lot of feedback about our tutorial and we're currently working on improving it. The game does have a bit of a learning curve, and takes some time to get the hang of. 

In the meantime we have put up some Tutorial videos and a FAQ which will help to explain the game a little better!
