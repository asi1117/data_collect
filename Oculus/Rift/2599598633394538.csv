2022-05-28 20:45:16.358921,Deifit,A lot of bugs,bugs and more bugs and more bugs...,Oct 30 at 3:55 AM,1, 19,We are sorry that our game does not meet your expectations. We do our best to make sure that the vast majority of issues arising in The Wizards - Dark Times will not occur in the free Multiplayer Co-Op Mode we are currently working on. We hope you will like it!
2022-05-28 20:45:16.373881,Krychersik,I always wanted to become a sorcerer!,"I haven't finished the game yet, but everything I've seen so far is amazing.
The game looks great, the views are really beautifull.

Combat in the game is really cool. Gestures used to cast magic spells work excellent and gives you a lot of fun. There is a lot of spells to cast, but after introduction you cast it very easily. You can create nice combos with them like freezing an enemy and crushing them into pieces with another spell.

Great game! I can honestly recommend it to everyone!","Jun 30, 2021 at 7:14 PM",5, 50,
2022-05-28 20:45:16.388841,sb413197,Overall pretty good,"A fun game, but a bit buggy and pretty short.  The multiple difficulty levels you sequentially unlock extend the play time, but there are only like 7 different monsters in the game or something, and unlike the first Wizards game there are no other bosses other than the big baddie at the end.  Overall I'm glad I played it but it could be a lot more detail.","Mar 22, 2021 at 3:36 AM",4, 37,
2022-05-28 20:45:16.403801,Schompix,To Short,The game Mechanics are Brilliant but the story is to short.,"Feb 16, 2021 at 5:10 PM",3, 35,
2022-05-28 20:45:16.417763,Az0th,Improves on the original in every way,"Let's get this out of the way first: the visuals in this game are incredible, and far better than the original, as is the combat, spellcasting, level traversal (the climbing is well implemented and adds a lot to it), and pretty much everything else about it.

One problem I had with the original is that, once I had fully upgraded fireball, that was basically all I used,  as it could one-shot most enemies unless I decided to apply a modifier to increase their health. This game fixes that, for the most part. Every spell is particularly useful in different situations, and toying with the idea of spells being weakened due to environmental effects, such as rain weakening fire, made those levels particularly interesting by limiting your choices of spells. The reason I think it only solved this problem 'for the most part' is that, once you get the arcane beam spell, it's always the first spell you consider, since it's a lot more powerful than your other spells, being capable of killing one of the mini-bosses in seconds, and the only situations in which it could be at a disadvantage compared to other spells is in winding corridoors, or when there are a lot of pillars / obstacles that your beam can't get through, and that enemies are hiding behind.

The spells feel a lot more impactful to use, particularly with the effects (frozen, burning, etc.), and the feeling of power when you first freeze an enemy solid and blast them to pieces with arcane pulse is more than I think I ever found in the original. It feels a lot more like weaving spells together as opposed just chucking them around, especially with certain spells allowing you to use them to cast new spells (e.g lightning -> lightning nova), and that is a massive improvement on the original.

In short: if you liked the original or if you enjoy other spellcasting games, then this is a must buy.

edit: I'm currently trying a new game+ and will edit again with my opinion on it once I am done. It's looking good so far.","Aug 27, 2020 at 4:10 PM",5, 32,
2022-05-28 20:45:19.541409,Mikjaw,Beautiful and Fun but Empty,"The visuals in this game are stunning. When I first walked into the area with the giant statues, I was happy to just sit there and stare for several minutes.

The use of gesture controls is a lot of fun. That said, I would have appreciated more depth in the gesture commands, like if you could string together any 3 of several gestures to make a spell. Unfortunately, once I got the laser beam spell, none of the other spells had a purpose.

Because there are no collectibles of value, no XP to be gained, (and a lot of asset reuse, which is fine), this game does not encourage exploration, which is unfortunate given how pretty the world is. A few clever puzzles would also go a long way, I think.

The worst part, I think, is that the player has no voice in the story. There are no decisions to be made outside of ""do I use the laser beam?"" For that reason, what story there is doesn't matter at all to me. Walk, fight, walk, skip climb section, fight, credits.

Ultimately this game is a beautiful showcase of some good gesture controls. It's not thought-provoking, but some of the visuals are awe-inspiring.","Jul 27, 2020 at 3:34 PM",4, 159,
2022-05-28 20:45:19.556369,brAInjax,A dream come true,"Finally, using gestures to cast magic. I’ve been waiting for this since VR went mainstream. This title is vastly improved over their first version. Being able to use either hand for casting is a great addition. 

I have to admit though, the game does feel a bit empty. No Hp, no collectibles of real value. I stood in one spot being attacked by 5 enemies for about 3 minutes before I got close to dying.","Sep 4, 2020 at 9:25 AM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 20:45:19.600251,MattSamiA,Not 1 star for the game - But Oculus,"Litterally been downloading and trying to install this game all day after purchase. Keep geeting the same error after maybe 1gb of the 11gb is needed,Oculus ran into a problem and cannot install this game. ............. 
I dont know WTF - but I have no choice but to miss what looks like a cool game and refumd my money.  IPDATED - lotsa messing around just to play the game, its no great, lacks story, visuals, land scapes look like something from 2017 - fun but sh1tty - if it was like oculus version of wizards then it would be amazing. 3 star game - gimme half life alyx 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Sep 27, 2020 at 2:35 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 20:45:22.689987,Masamune5454,"Beautiful scenery, and fun combat.","Theres few mage games in vr of high quality. The wizards was sorta there, but fell into a loop of wave shooting. this entry is beautiful, with cool level design and better enemys and best of all a revamped combat system. i want to emphasize this is the best part. play like your body is water, and amazing things happen. you can get very fluid with your spells and weave your spells like a true wizard. i do wish there was a EXP system ect. something that would make the walking and fighting more enjoyable by looting. the spells unlock when you pick them up, and are fully upgraded from the start. for instance the shield could have not been throwable like the first game until enough exp is spent on that spell, the two hand attacks could be the best upgrade, like the lightnings nova burst or the frost swords cant be thrown until upgraded. then have multiple for each. that would provide plenty of reason to throw some kind of EXP unit on the maps. speaking of, the maps are huge and beautiful. the environment is stunning. heres the problem, without a inventory or EXP system, it feels bland. like its falling in to the pitfall of the first game. look at stuff while you walk to the next battle, which happeneds in a wave style fashion alot of the time. you have melee this time around. there could have been more enemys, without these long sections of walking simulator and climbing simulator. and the climbing can be bypassed completely. which i wasnt to fond of. also the health regenerates, and im also not a fan of that. there are potions you can pick up in the game. i dont know why they didnt make potions to refill your health.(dont like regen health alot of times)
If they add new game plus, please think of these things.
 the chest are the only real interactables, and the items are more like collectables for your hub. maybe theres ways to change your colors for spells at hub, or unlocking character upgrades like more health. that would extend the game, like HLA resin mechanic?","Jun 18, 2020 at 8:24 AM",4, 84,
2022-05-28 20:45:22.704948,mnuneza,loved it,"Definitely one of those games that swallow you up with breathtaking sceneries and really fun enemies to kill. one thing that i really hoped this game changed was the length of the game, it felt a bit short, but really good story.","Aug 11, 2020 at 4:51 PM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 20:45:22.719907,adam.gallimore.581,great game!! but does have issues,"gamplay and story is lacking contant, overall of the short story is great other than the last area has a issue with falling throw the floor and being stuck in a loop.","Sep 1, 2020 at 2:03 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 20:45:22.733870,kikathom,Great combat!,"- Combat - 5 Original, fun, easy to use controls.
- story - 3 There is a story, but its almost non existant. 
- Polish - 3 a few minor bugs. The last area has a few missing textures and floors. There are a few places where teleportation locomotion is required to progress in the map.","Jun 11, 2020 at 1:35 PM",4, 24,
2022-05-28 20:45:22.749827,Aetherlis,Great game but a bit short,"Great if you are looking for a game with magic, it is easy to understand and play. Also nothing will scare you more than the portals in this game.","Aug 19, 2020 at 1:55 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 20:45:25.865494,Glitch Fandango,Brilliant game for any mighty Wizards,"I’m still very early on in my play through but everything I’ve experienced so far is absolutely brilliant. The game looks beautiful and the voice acting is cool without being cheesy. But the big winner here is the spell casting mechanics, which are so satisfying to use. 

Combat in this game is an absolute joy for me, as a gamer who doesn’t really enjoy gun based games. This offers a brilliant alternative, as you perfect the different gestures and learn to string together combos and focus specific spells on particular enemy types. It’s really unique and something that really celebrates VR in the best possible way.

The devs have said that they will be releasing an arena mode later in the year and once that lands I’m fairly sure I’ll add the 5th star. Carbon studios, if you’re reading this, well done. You e made something that you should be proud of!

PS: I know it’s not on your road map but if you can put together a PvP game/mode based on these mechanics (think wizard Pavlov) that would be AMAZING! Current Dark Times + Arena + PvP = 10/5 star ultra game.

Edit: Now that I’ve finished the campaign I can say that this is an absolutely top notch game. Well done team! That said, the game desperately needs more enemy types. There are only 3 enemy types (2 of which are a bit pointless) and 3 mini boss enemies who appear occasionally throughout the whole game. I really hope they can introduce 1 or 2 more for the arena mode otherwise the replay value is going to fall short...","Jun 19, 2020 at 1:49 AM",4, 19,
2022-05-28 20:45:25.880454,CaptainBackfat,"Great level design, art and weapons!","First off, the game looks incredible, but you have to have a beast system to run it in Very High settings like I do with i7-9700K+RTX2080ti.  I've heard that even RTX2070 struggles on Very High  settings, but if you have the beef then hope you find this game beautiful as I did.

I only wish you adjust the difficulty by adding more enemies, or replaying with all your unlocked spells from the start.  Overall, a very good game, especially at this price.","Jun 11, 2020 at 10:45 AM",5, 13,
2022-05-28 20:45:25.895414,I3oltAction,Its alright,"Not worth the cost, I think this should be more like $15. Has tons of glitches, in fact I had to load my last checkpoint 3 times just to get through the tutorial level due to them and even restart the entire game when the audio wouldnt work. Ended up crashing my PC after my head clipped into one of the walls. The spell controls felt janky. The story is also not very immersive, I found myself asking what I was even doing about an hour in. Great concept and potential, but needs more polishing to make it feel better and eliminate the bugs.","Jul 12, 2020 at 9:51 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 20:45:25.911372,BigRed1Juan,Loads of Magical Fun,"Day2 of playing this amazing game, If you were ever a Diablo fan you will understand why this game is truely amazing. On Day1 of my stream, I became frustrated with the spells as I could not get them to work properly. That being said, I believe it is by design. We all know any great wizard does not just jump in an become an expert in spell making overnight. So if you buy this game, do not refund it. Your magic will grow and your powers will smoothen out as you move past the first Ice Witch. 

The crawl is re warding and the visuals are beautiful. I really enjoy vanquishing the minions and shroomies. The bosses are a very rewarding challenge as you earn magial powers. I will not compare this to other games becasue it truely stand on its own. 

If you are on the fence about purchasing this game, trust me it is A+ fun role playing. Just let loose and have fun and get into it. Think llike a mage, and you will not be disappointed.  Look for my stream, Day2, Facebook@BigRed1Juan, if you are curious about it . I do my best to keep it real and role play for mine as well as my followers enjoyment.","Jun 8, 2020 at 7:20 AM",5, 8,
