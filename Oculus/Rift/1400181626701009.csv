And judging by the non responses from the developers and a lot of people saying it is not working and no solution even being offered. Uninstalled and reinstalled and still got the same thing.

2022-05-28 19:38:06.317651,NuttleStuff,Not worth the download! APP is BROKEN!,"Complete waste of time, don't even bother downloading.  When it loads it just says ""Let choose a photo that's been prepared"" and all it does is load without pulling anything up.  I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and get the same thing. This app is broken and doesn't seem to have any support, or anyone that cares for it anymore. It's a great idea, but that's as far as it goes, it's still just an idea.  Definitely don't download until you see something about an update and/or a message from the devs. I wouldn't and I don't expect anything though, this has been out awhile, and obviously from my review, the app has not been tended to and doesn't show any sign that it will be. Maybe somebody that actually wants this concept to work will pick it up and make something of it.","Aug 15, 2019 at 8:39 AM",1, 13,

2022-05-28 19:38:06.349567,Devilstower,A work in progress -- but very neat,"Certainly the biggest issue is that EmbodyMe doesn't. That is, the avatar is only visible in the mirror, not in first person as it is in Star Trek or Elite. That's disappointing, and my attempts to take my photo and turn it into a 'head' certainly highlights the need for further controls. But I really like what they're doing here, appreciate being given an early look, and hope it continues to improve. Being actually ""embodied"" within VR is critical for the entertainments I enjoy most.

Still endorse what I wrote above, and appreciate the glimpse at the technology, but it's simply failed to move forward.","Sep 28, 2018 at 12:57 AM",2, 4,

2022-05-28 19:38:09.467378,ZejaPyle,Nothing there...,"Nothing to do there. Nothing really to see ethier, unless you like concrete corridors and not even good mirror. If you are looking for being in a vr world, better try High Fidelity VR or VRChat.","Jan 27, 2018 at 1:01 PM",1, 5,
2022-05-28 19:38:09.483335,neuro27,"Interesting Concept, Poor Execution","The first thing I noticed when starting this app is that I was looking down on my mirror image which was staring at my chest. The mirror pose is off which breaks the illusion immediately. Next, the inverse kinematics were attempted, but fail in execution. It's difficult to guess where your elbows should go based on your hand position alone, but IK is key to maintaining a sense of looking into a mirror. There are some clothing and hair selections to choose from to edit your avatar further, but the main draw of this app is the ability to change your face based on a picture. There are three ways to choose how to ""embody"" someone. First, choose one the dozen photos the developers have preselected. These all work fairly well, as they are the ideal lighting and orientation. Second, take a picture, which I did not try. Third, choose a picture off of your hard drive. The photo selection defaulted to D:/Photos, so any that you would want to use must be placed there. The photo selection was slow, not smooth at all. For the photos that I tried, most said ""no face detected"" and the ones that did work, did not work very well at all. One had not the best lighting, so my face came out looking like a zombie. The other one had a beard, which was not placed correctly on the face. Overall, this app is a neat idea, but it has a long ways to go before it's anything more than that. There's no real sense of ""presence,"" of actually embodying another person, just the illusion of it.","Jun 22, 2017 at 8:28 AM",2, 5,
2022-05-28 19:38:09.499292,misguidedSpectacle,needs work,"I mean, the IK works decently. The only thing I can say about that is that you can tell the models don't scale based on user height, so if you look down the model is pulled upwards, standing on tiptoes in a way that you're clearly not. In that sense, it's probably for the best that the body isn't rendered in first person, but the fact that the avatars only show up in mirrors is still disappointing.

As someone else mentioned, the mirrors are implemented wrong. Some are better than others, but none of them are rendered right and it definitely drags the whole thing down.

Not sure if the devs are still working on this at all, but I'd really like to see them add calibration, first person avatars, and fix the mirrors. Until then, you can probably save yourself the disk space.","May 18, 2017 at 7:52 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 19:38:09.514253,SPLARK,Lonely =(,"a grey room with no people in it. i created a character and i dont understand how to play multiplayer. the watch on you wrist is just to get to pictures of random people hanging out with their friends. maybe a tutorial on how to hangout with friends like those other people would be nice. also, the audio isn't so great... i know it isn't me when i play rec room, and altspace with a perfect audio... when i talk, the videos skip some of my words with static in the background and lags. LOTS of lag! i tried to make a video asking how to play online and what i got was- ""ck someon hep e pay n multi paykcher...?"" so i ended up needing to repeat my sentence SLOWLY- ""can someone... help me... get on... multiplayer."" i watched the video and 1 sec into the video i said- ""NOPE! that static is going to make someone's ear's bleed!""

2022-05-28 19:38:12.608069,jmalmsten,Uhm... an empty room and wonky creations,"I do not expect much from free apps. But what am I supposed to do here? I'm dropped into a character creation bit. I choose from the very sparse types of clothes and take my photo for the face. No facial hair is available so my avatar only gets the mustache-portion from the image. The full body interpretation is wonky as heck. And when I've done something that looks just vaguely like myself (no glasses either available) I find myself teleporting around a handful of empty, dead, grey rooms... uhm... ok. Now what? I have some sort of wristband with non-descript functions. Nothing makes anything appear in the void of the rooms. So... again... character created. Now... what am I supposed to do here?","Mar 25, 2017 at 2:56 AM",2, 1,
