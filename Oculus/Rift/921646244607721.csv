2022-05-28 19:27:59.270481,Satconcook,Short visual concept advertisement,"The visuals for this are delightful and the song is pleasing. It has the feel of a Fable style game that I would love to see more of. However, it is just over 2 minutes, the length of the song ‘Dream nº1’, and an advertisement for the full album on 5 different services that will open in tabs in your web browser. I would love to see something like the entire album as a VR visual experience though.","Jan 25, 2020 at 4:02 PM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 19:27:59.314363,DTH,I do love this but it is short.  would,like to go down the path under the bridge.  Also would like to see more like this. The a button does not work for me.,"Jan 9, 2019 at 6:34 AM",4, 3,"Hi! Thank you very much for the feedback. I just update the app and I've fixed A button issue with touch controllers. ""Dreams"" are short piano themes and maybe someday I'll publish all my themes in VR, but for the moment ""Dream nº1"" is the only one in VR. Thank you very much for watching and greetings!"
2022-05-28 19:28:02.434019,SteveG7RTA,Beautifull but short,"I downloaded this a year ago & I still take a look occasionally. It's very well done & the music is lovely. My only complaint is that it's too short.
Any sign of No 2 yet?  I want more :)","Oct 25, 2018 at 4:47 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 19:28:02.493859,Arqan0,Cute but slightly boring,The visuals are rather beautiful but there is not all that much going on in this short experience.,"Dec 1, 2017 at 6:38 PM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 19:28:05.614512,vtid,High quality short experience.,"I downloaded this when it first came out and I still dip in every few weeks or months for a couple of minutes.  I like the music.  I gave this 5 stars originally, thinking the dev had created/drawn all the visuals, until I realised they were from a library.  However, this is still nicely put together, and the piano track is original and really good.  I still enjoy the experience every so often.","Jun 26, 2018 at 4:42 AM",3, 3,

2022-05-28 19:28:08.778051,Bel-garath,Very short but worth the ride,"Not something that you would watch more than once or twice, but well executed. I would have preferred not having that cursor move everywhere you move your head. It's distracting. Also, a little more life in the village would have been nice. The piano was beautiful and it's free which is why I'm not rating this lower. If it had cost anything, I would have given it 2 stars.","Feb 1, 2017 at 9:23 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 19:28:08.806974,neuro27,"Nice, but Empty","Cool, short experience, but there is no story or narrative. The piano music was beautiful and complimented the scene nicely. The butterfuly cursor that follows your gaze unfortunately distracts from the beautiful environment. Worth a download nonetheless.","Jun 22, 2017 at 8:27 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:28:08.821934,Microship,,"Enjoyable, but as another reviewer noted, that cursor (and the butterfly) are really annoying. Could you add a setting to disable them?","Feb 2, 2017 at 5:02 AM",3, 0,
2022-05-28 19:28:08.836894,Sheeplovsky,I like it,"Can't complain. It is a free, nice and beautiful animation through a fairytale miniature village. Reminds me of a nice place in a fantasy MMORPG I played some time ago.","Dec 22, 2016 at 5:48 AM",4, 2,

2022-05-28 19:28:11.923638,Julius-X,Very Pretty,"Nice short experience, but it nails the presentation.  Since it's on-rails, you can't do much, but the music is good.  I can't wait to see more.","Jan 3, 2017 at 12:46 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 19:28:11.938598,MrTee_,Dull,"Not sure what the point behind this is, but it was pretty dull and boring. Lasts like 3 minutes where you just hover along the ground and watch some houses, trees, water and a butterfly. Watch once, delete.","Dec 17, 2016 at 8:31 PM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 19:28:11.952561,dhc418,A Good Start,"It's a good demonstration of what VR can do, but as a stand-alone product it's way too short and way too limited. Worth watching once though.","Dec 31, 2016 at 3:51 AM",3, 0,
