I didn't have very high expectations, but I was surprised that I had quite a bit of fun. There aren't a lot of levels or anything, and there does come a point where you just don't stand a chance against the zombies, but I did enjoy it. And it's nice to have a Teen rated zombie game that doesn't have horror or too much blood.","Jan 8, 2021 at 8:37 AM",5, 9,
