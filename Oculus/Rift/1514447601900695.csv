2022-05-28 18:02:13.617235,MisterGadZooks,Give this little gem a whirl!,"Although the initial video quality at the outset is a bit degraded and pixelated, I found this to be a uniquely enjoyable experience overall as the visuals became steadily more ""psychedelic"" in nature. The acting is actually competent with the light motif sketch of story engaging. As VR is still in it's infancy as an entertainment and communications medium, it is truly exciting to see what Creative Minds can create with this esoteric ""blank canvas"". Cheers!","May 19, 2020 at 7:24 AM",4, 4,

2022-05-28 18:02:13.647155,flussgleiter,Interesting concept technically mediocre,"This short film tries to be arty and sometimes succeeds in it when photographic visuals transform into a kind of abstract paintings and the actors are better than average. But most of the time the visual effects are hammering onto your eyes - too much moving and floating blurriness with a stomach sickening effect. While this might be a desired effect in some movies, here it is only distracting and kept my mind off the story. Thus the scenes felt too long and I just wanted them to proceed.","Aug 4, 2019 at 6:06 PM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 18:02:13.662115,berickphilip,Quite the awesome hidden gem,"It is just a story, and short at that, and also the video is not high quality; probably in 2016-2017 that was about as high quality as 180 degree cameras could go for non-multi-million-dollar productions anyway. But the content is so good. Not overly-acted like a lot of the other experiences. Not standard cliche'd scenes. And not ""100% cutesy and safe for the family"". Pretty much a very good sci-fi-esque short episode. Just watch it already.","Jun 18, 2019 at 9:28 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 18:02:16.768806,Chazmeister,,"Very good, really impressed! Very cool cyber reality type sci-fi short story. Takes a few minutes to set the scene and get things going but well worth sticking with. 

Yes, the video is a bit on the low res side, but what they do with it is very good and quite creative. It's well acted and overall the production quality is good.

This is the sort of thing that makes VR stand out from other story telling mediums. Look forward to seeing what they do next.","May 19, 2019 at 11:35 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:02:16.783766,SandDragon,Amazing Experience,"This is without a doubt the most amazing non interactive experience I've had so far in VR. The acting was superb and well directed. I loved it. I hope they do more.
You are shuffled between first and third person through a movie with awesome special effects to where you are not sure what is real (in the movie) and what is not. The movement through the video is not disorientating. I can't say more with spoiling it. You just need to try it.","Dec 16, 2018 at 6:21 AM",5, 5,

While some may find the ""altered states"" style visuals throughout the experience, I found that they were well used and quite fitting to the story being told. I'd love to see more immersive content of this caliber! Bravo!","Apr 27, 2018 at 10:52 PM",5, 4,

It is perfectly executed, well written and thought provoking, long after viewing. If you don't need to be hand held through a movie, then ignore the 1 star reviews and enjoy this glimpse into the future of filmmaking.","Apr 30, 2018 at 11:07 PM",5, 4,

It was by far the best 360 video I've ever seen (and I've actually paid for couple), with a somewhat similar feel to Black Mirror but with very cool visual effects/filters. Being so close to the characters also makes it feel somewhat like a play as opposed to a movie.","Nov 28, 2017 at 11:43 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 18:02:26.294328,vtid,"Potential, but boring, and my poor eyes!","I found this actually put a bit of a strain on my eyes whilst watching. The low visual quality, OTT effects and the way in which the background 'moves' with bizarre effects attached, come together to form messy and uncomfortable visuals.  

However I can understand others' optimism for this VR genre.  I think a lot of effort went into this piece, and parts of it worked, but overall I found it boring.","Oct 11, 2017 at 9:34 PM",2, 3,

It wasn't the best movie, nor was it the best VR experience but in terms of non-animated VR movies it is cutting edge.   Great use of the camera and audio to tell the story and really put you up close and personal with the characters.","Oct 4, 2017 at 2:44 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:02:29.428944,cybernettr,Disturbing yet boring,"360 degree 3-D video short. Some interesting video effects, such as an image that fills in as you turn your head and Prizma-style filters applied to a video image. Acting only fair and casting a little too PC for my tastes. Gratuitous use of adult and death themes. I'm sure it's not easy to create a gripping live-action video short, but unfortunately this effort didn't succeed. About halfway through, I found myself waiting for it to be over.","Sep 1, 2017 at 12:27 AM",2, 2,

I didn't know what I was getting into when I started this short film, but I finished with a renewed sense of what VR film has to offer audiences. I am very glad to see this make it to consumers.

2022-05-28 18:02:32.606446,FastLawyer,Just watch Miyubi instead,"This VR 360 movie experience is okay and I gave it 3 stars mostly because it's free and it had an interesting premise.  But look at the resolution on Miyubi compared to this movie.  It's night and day difference.  Miyubi is the future of 360 video, this is the past.  Not only that, but Miyubi has a better story and actors.  But compared to other 360 videos, it does deserve 3 stars because most 360 videos are unfortunately, not very good.","Jul 28, 2017 at 12:35 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:02:32.620408,baggyg,Great Direction / Bad 360,"I actually really liked this. It had an original feel to it and I was genuinely interested what was happening and what would come next. The direction was great and starts to show a different type of film making needed for 360. Unfortunately the whole experience is marred by the underlying technology. 360 videos are just not at a stage where they are particularly comfortable or impressive. The resolution is low and it does strain your eyes. 

Overall 5* for the makers / director. 1* for the technology.","Jul 28, 2017 at 2:08 AM",2, 2,
2022-05-28 18:02:32.636366,Deeperbeige,Indecipherable and unique,"I think I only grasped the basics of what I just saw, and can't really describe it beyond ""it's the second weirdest thing I've seen in VR to date"". I think it's well worth experiencing however. This plays to one of VR's most interesting features - it's ability to transport you to a place you could never see first-hand, and could never get a good sense of from a 2D film. It's probably not for everyone, but I'm personally glad it exists.","Aug 4, 2017 at 9:36 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 18:02:35.755025,Aeschlar,Psychedelic VR experience,"Yes, it's blocky and pixelated, but I feel it actually plays into it.

It being obscured and hard to see works with the subject matter of the film itself.

The visuals are a must experience.  This is a great alteration of light and sound that could only be done in VR.","Aug 16, 2017 at 3:46 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:02:35.769984,CanIbiteYou,An Amateurish Mess,"Ambtious and actually somewhat decent idea completly ruined by overacting (seriously guys, student theater actors are usually better then this - the lover girl is the only one who is okaish, main character alejandro - just lol), bad direction choices, bad script, bad writing and uninspired use of VR medium. Regarding technical aspects - the resolution is way to low and color grading is bad and the scale of actors compared to the viewer (who are to small since camera angle position is choosen wrongly) is completly messed up. Typical artsy fartsy student project. It's kinda funny to see the directors name in the title.","Jul 31, 2017 at 12:27 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 18:02:35.784944,GroovyTim,Psyche,"Wow.. This was really good. Dont let the reports of disorentation of sounds and images fool you, IMO that is part of the story and is a great experience. These kinds of Phyche & or Psychedellic experiences are more often than not what you bring to the experience and what you percieve. If you find this uncomfortable and disorientating it is because of what is in you, and not what is being presented.","Jul 27, 2017 at 3:54 PM",4, 3,

2022-05-28 18:02:35.813867,FriendCalledFive,A glimpse of future story telling in VR,"This is a really impressive short story that is really enhanced though VR.

Technically there are issues as the source material is limited by current poor quality 360 video tech and you get a bit nauseous if you move your head, but I will forgive it as it pushes the boundaries of story telling in VR.","Jul 27, 2017 at 4:16 PM",4, 1,
