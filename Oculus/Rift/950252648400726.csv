The controls are simple to master and the game is an absolute steel at the asking price! I would recommend not eating beans or spicy food before playing this as there could be an accident.
I would genuinely like to thank the developers for making the experience CROSS-BUY (You buy it on the Rift you get it free on the Quest & vice versa) So I can now show friends and family this excellent experience on my new Quest! Thank you, Your a real team player!","Dec 24, 2019 at 5:45 AM",5, 16,
2022-05-28 14:50:27.390271,Camaro17,pretty good for the price,"so i've just bought a rift last winter, after using the PSVR for a year or 2, and the 1st thing i did after ordering the rift was searching the internet for horror vr games to play.

this game ""Dead halls""being the top scariest game, on various websites and in youtube videos in winter of 2018,  i decided to pick this up

as I played the first 10 minutes of the game, i was thinking to myself that this was a truely scary game, and was ready to be freaked out, well i was wrong...

sure it was creepy for a few minutes, but then i started to notice one thing, that was a real game breaker for me, 

the game really isn't that scary, what really kills it for me is the fact that everytime a monster is near by creepy music starts to play, so now i know theres something near by, the only monster thats somewhat scary is the ""crazy looking Ring girl"" all the others that i've seen look cool but they're just not scary

other then that its a pretty decent game for the price

i'd give the gameplay a good 3 out of 5...

but the scare factor at least for me is maybe a 2 out of 5

i have yet to find a VR game that scares the crap out of me like Resident Evil 7 VR did on the PS4","Nov 16, 2019 at 2:27 AM",3, 6,

2022-05-28 14:50:33.707159,taquitobuddy,"Creepy, but not much fun","Pros:
-Great audio, the music and ambience sounds are on point
-Creepy and unsettling, even after knowing how the monsters work
Neutral:
-Graphics are servicable, not terrible, not great
-VR implementation is very basic, works but could be better
Cons:
-Repetitive and somewhat tedious after awhile
-Aside from some basic monster rules/interactions, very little to the actual gameplay

Overall, if you are mostly interested in a creepy VR experience then I could recommend this, 4-5 stars.  If you are looking for a good VR game that is also creepy, can't recommend, 1-2 stars.","Mar 12, 2019 at 12:19 PM",3, 4,

Five minutes later: goosebumps, hair standing up, eyes watering and sweat pouring out. Legitimately horrifying experience. This version recaptures that horror and implements a storyline.

2022-05-28 14:50:40.045482,SirCodes,Prepare to be Truly Terrified,"I have been avoiding this title for a while because of how scared I get from horror games. Well, this one scares the pants off of me! The difference here though is that the game does not rely on jump scares, instead it scares you with the haunting atmosphere and grotesque creatures. It puts you in narrow hallways, dark open rooms, and other nightmare-fuel spaces while you effectively scare yourself with the thought of what could be lurking just around the corner (or behind you!) It also gives you a real sense of accomplishment, at least it did for me, when you finish a dungeon and finally find your way out. If you are looking for a GOOD horror game, this is what you want. It's fun to play with friends and watch them get scared too. It also has replay value, so you'll want to go back again and again. Just remember... don't look at her!","Mar 19, 2018 at 2:17 AM",5, 6,

You get this great sense of immersion as you continuously walk through these halls (DREADHALL, obvi!).  I recommend you change the settings before starting a new game, especially if you're a VR veteran.  Make sure you turn off any comfort mode, take off move to direction looking, make sure snap turning is off, and set the movement bar all the way to maximum.

The concept is simple. You are alone, in a dungeon, with nothing but a lantern to light your way, your courage to push you forward, and you must find your way out... but the horrors that lurk within have different plans. The game does a great job of making you feel alone, helpless, defenseless, and like you're being watched and followed from the moment you first spawn in. I have watched friends who wanted to try after watching me play be paralyzed with fear and unable to open the first door. I would give the game 5/5 stars for immersiveness. 5/5 for the sounds.  3/5 for the graphics, however that didn't affect my enjoyment of the game.

I love watching let's plays of this game, and it's probably one of the scariest games out there. However, me and 3 friends got headaches and felt nausiated after playing it for only about 3 minutes each. We passed the headset around on one level and everyone felt awful. I've tried several times to come back to it, but I instantly get sick.

The problem is walking has very little accelleration so movement makes you feel like you're shooting forward. Even when standing and only turning IRL, moving forward makes me feel like im being flung forward. Don't even think about turning ingame, unless you want to feel even more sick. If they update the game to not cause such motion sickness I'll give it another try","Nov 1, 2017 at 3:49 AM",1, 8,

The best you can do is hide and hope the monster chasing you is A) too big to fit into a hallway or B) gives up chasing you. You can also run out of oil or be killed by your own curiousity.

2022-05-28 14:50:49.535038,Sid_London,This will be a future 'VR classic'!,"Dreadhalls has been out a while, but still stands up well to the newer horror games out there. It took me about seven attempts, just to get out of the starting room (yes, I'm a wuss). The game has a perfect mix of intense creepiness and interesting gameplay (the talking faces are a brilliant touch) with the sort of weird fantasy characters you get in old-school Japanese horrors. The gameplay is longer than many other VR games at this price (not including the time it takes just to inch your way along the first corridor) and definitely worth the money. It is incredibly immersive and doesn't rely on random jump moments to scare you. The entire experience from start to finish scares you! I'm hoping to see more games from the creators of Dreadhalls in the future. Well done team!

*** Edit: I just noticed on the Dreadhalls website that this was created by one person. ONE person! Wow! Someone please give Sergio tons of money and a team to make another bigger game - you'll be making a great investment!","Sep 6, 2017 at 6:46 PM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 14:50:55.846391,neuro27,Truly Terrifying; Even better with Touch,"Sometimes the most effective form of horror isn’t what you can see, rather what you can’t. It’s this method of delivery that the studio has gone for, creating dark dimly lit corridors and rooms to explore. After 30 minutes of gameplay, you can start to get the hang of what's going on. It's only after I encountered my first real dangerous monster, and died point in fact, that I was able to remember where I was (in my living room) and the horror started to fade. The scariest things are the unknown, and once you get to know the layout and mechanics, the horror goes away somewhat. All except the gargoyles, those things are always freaky! The game includes  the random map generator which aims to give further longevity to the main story mode, and the map feature is novel. The new Touch controls are expertly implemented. You can now light your way with a little more direction by holding a lantern with one hand, and point to objects you want to grab to bring them towards you with the other. You’ll also be able to bring up the in-game map with your right hand, with which you can chart your progress through procedurally-generated dungeons.","Jun 22, 2017 at 8:26 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 14:51:02.217606,Laz77,Still the best VR horror experience.,"I've been hoping for another game to come out and trump this one when it comes to horror but nothing has yet to come close. Games like ""Affected: The Manor"" and even the newly released ""Dont Knock Twice"" are essentially on rail jump scare simulators. While ""Don't Knock Twice"" gets some of the sound design right, it essentially only gives you on direction to head in with triggered events. You want to know why this game still works better than all the others? First the sense of claustrophobia and inability to escape is excellently portrayed. When you find an exit you literally breathe a sigh of relief. Second, the sound design is excellent. What makes great horror games like ""Amnesia"" and other's in the same genre work is the sound design. For the first hour of that game you hardly encounter a monster but you are on edge the whole time because of what you hear but don't see. The same holds true here. Third, there is an ""oh s@!%"" sprint button so you know that there are things that will kill you and things you will need to run from. All the other horror games out now either have slow locomotion or teleporting so you KNOW all your in for are jump scares or small tasks to prevent death. ""Yawn"". Great job Dreadhall devs. Please make a sequel.","Oct 31, 2017 at 10:48 AM",5, 0,

For people getting motion sickness, it will pass as you spend more time in VR. You will as time goes on come to appreciate the locomotion feature for navigation versus the teleporting. Locomotion really adds to the submersion.  Just get it!","Feb 19, 2017 at 8:40 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 14:51:05.355360,timali,Never Been So Scared,"Never before has a game scared me so much. It's not so much the jump scares that makes this game get under your skin, but rather the creepy, eerie, feeling of dread and suspense you get as you wander around a claustraphobic dungeon, dimly lit and terrifying. There is a surprising amount of depth and exploration to this game, especially considering you do not have any weapons. You must learn as you go how best to deal with each adversary, and a single mistake can prove to be fatal, resulting in restarting the level. At first, this seems harsh, but it greatly adds to the pressure and stress you feel as you explore, knowing that at any instant a botched encounter can do you in. This was so intense and creepy that I could only play one level per day, and I nearly had to force myself to do it, dreading it all day long. This is the closest I have ever come to being truly in a horror movie. But in the end, finally beating it provides a great sense of accomplishment. At first, turning gave me motion sickness, but then I enabled the ""comfort turn"", and played standing up so I could move around without turning so much, and all was well, except for being so terrified and sweaty that my goggles kept steaming up.","Jan 12, 2017 at 12:50 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 14:51:05.370320,xxOldManLoganxx,NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART,"This has become one of my all time favorites. It is one of the scariest, if not the scariest game I have ever played. The graphics are simple but the atmosphere remains amazing throughout. It is a simple concept executed very well and feels very polished. I liked the control style, however buyers should be aware that this may cause motion sickness for those who have not yet got their vr legs or who are really new to vr. I really really hope there is a sequel. If you are into horror movies and games consider this a killer app...","Jan 12, 2017 at 5:17 PM",5, 3,

My Thoughts:
One of the top rated and scariest VR experience currently on the oculus Rift.

Game Details:
Experience a new kind of immersive horror in Dreadhalls!
You are trapped deep inside a massive dungeon. Explore it, survive it, and find a way to escape. Your only weapons will be stealth, your own courage, and a faint light.
Inspired by the survival horror and roguelike genres, Dreadhalls has been terrorizing people ever since its debut at the 2013 Oculus + Indiecade VR Jam.
Dreadhalls is an intense and scary experience, not for the faint of heart. You have been warned!","Jan 28, 2017 at 11:23 PM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 14:51:08.555962,MiddleMan82,,"I have to say I wasn't expecting much from this. I don't scare easy and there didn't seem like there was a lot to do, so I would have passed on this normally. I won the game in a poker tournament on Casino VR, so I thought I'd give it a go. Within 5 minutes I needed new underwear and was actually sweating so much my Rift was steaming up. I found myself standing at the end of a corridor, not wanting to go back because of what I'd just ran away from. Now I know why horror games work so well in VR, even for someone who doesn't scare easy.

I would rate this higher if there was a bit more to do, and the graphics were a bit more varied, but as far as scares go this does it well, and shows the potential of future horror games.","Nov 26, 2016 at 8:43 AM",4, 6,

2022-05-28 14:51:18.007064,Wrek86,Amazing,"This game is well worth the money. Most horror games out there are based on jump scares that us VR you throw things right into your face and a startling loud sound synchronized with the visual, but this game isn't playing in the same field as those. This game delivers a creepy atmosphere with very well done graphics. The reason this game scared me wasn't because of a jump scare, but because the environment was eerie, mixed with surrounding ambiance audio, scratching on the walls, crying in the distance, and the echo of your footsteps shattering the silence. You feel yourself there in those halls and when you see a crature standing in the dark corner you freeze in fear and watch it closely. It lunges and you run for your life, your heart racing, the music of your impending doom running behind you. When you get away you catch your breath in the game and in real life. It's tense, creepy, and does an amazing job at capturing the fear of the unknown, being chased, monsters, ghosts, and even the primal fear of the dark and what lurks within it. I recommend that horror fans play this game. Never has a game truly scared me like this one has. If you are prone to VR sickness, this game can be hard to play, but they added a new snap feature that will probably help until you can use the smooth turning. I haven't tried the snap turning myself, but when I first used VR snap turns were helpful to make VR sickness tolerable until I became accustomed to it.","Nov 2, 2016 at 1:53 AM",5, 6,
