2022-05-28 13:56:25.982178,Turgrodan,fun game,"I played this to the 2nd time redo on my older computer but I just got a new computer RTX 3080 with 12700KF and Windows 11.  It just crashes on load now.

Update: 
I found the solution on Reddit.  It has something to do with OpenSSL and newer generation CPUs.
Follow these steps:

Go to System --> Advanced System Settings --> Environment Variables (You might get to this differently in different versions of Windows)

In THE SECOND window (""System Variables"") click NEW

Enter name ""OPENSSL_ia32cap""

Enter value ""0x200000200000000""

Then click OK

You must REBOOT SYSTEM

This solved the crashing problem I was having with several Oculus VR apps and several Steam VR apps.",Jan 24 at 9:03 AM,5, 12,"Thanks for posting a solution to an issue, hopefully that helps other Users!"
2022-05-28 13:56:26.001127,yigalzr,Frustratingly unbalanced difficulty,"Some games are good and you enjoy the experiance till the end. Some are bad or less good, so you can decide from the beginning whether you don't want to play it, or go on playing knowing ahead what you are dealing with.
But the worst kind, are the very rare type of games which are actually good, and you want to keep playing them, untill the dificuly level pumps up in such an exegurated and frastraing way, that you give up and stop playing. That leaves a bitter taste and unfortunatly that is the case with this one.
The thing is, the frastration is not because the difficulty of dealing with the enemies, that I managed, but after I did finally got to the end of the level, I lost because I only had 65 out of the 70 pieces of items I needed to collect during the level. I tried this level for I don't know how many times. Every time I either died, or survived but did not have enough peices to pass the level. 
Now this is BS. The gamesplay is fun, hectic and chalanging, but somehow it's like Gandlaph standing there saying ""you shall not pass"".
Thanks a lot for half of an enjoyable campaign, which took long enough to pass the refund period.",Feb 19 at 8:32 AM,1, 2,"Dear Yigalzr, Sorry too hear your's having difficulty with Timeline 2, it can be difficult to complete the secondary objective.
The only advice I can give is to focus on shooting off the zombie limbs and you should be able to keep shooting them after they have been killed. I also recommend using the shotgun as it's good for breaking off body parts.

2022-05-28 13:56:26.017085,dave.parry.1953,One of the most fun VR games,"I love this game. Putting zombies down in different ways is just a blast, it's the one game I play nearly every day. I won't drop a star for these but there's a couple of things - I get the shotgun and so have that and the pistol, but then I HAVE to select the axe which means having to drop one of my ranged weapons. Would be good if I could keep my ranged weapons. The other thing is that the levels seem a bit long when there's no saves in them. If I'm called away or have to deal with an acrobatic cat, I'd like to be able to keep my progress but I can't.

No biggie though. It's a fantastic game and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves a good blasting session without having to think too much.",Jan 12 at 9:23 PM,5, 1,"Thank you for the positive review!

I was surprised to experience a fun game with some cool horde challenges which I just do once in a while because it's pretty fun.
I also love the voice acting which adds some story to the game.
I also love the fact that you have a small set of weapons and this is exactly what you need without any modifications or upgrades to chase after.

2022-05-28 13:56:32.398202,BronzaKnight,Amazing!...but not perfect yet,"Drop Dead is a VR arcade shooter that makes me feel nostalgic just playing it. I enjoy it and prefer it over Robo Recall. I do however have some things to say about it.
First of all, nothing is spread out. You witness all of the new things at one time. If you put newer zombies in the 2nd and 3rd timeline than that would make a big difference.
Second, The co-op doesn't have much to it. If you made a co-op campaign for 2 to 4 players, that would also be nice.
Lastly, the game focuses mostly on just two big levels. You could at least give the farm world a boss of some sort.

Conclusion, it's a great game, it just needs some more work put into it.","May 30, 2020 at 6:12 AM",4, 4,

I own both the Quest and Rift S. As this game is a cross-buy game, I'd love to play it with my wife in co-op mode. But because it uses your Oculus account to find matches (unlike other games which have you setup an account), I'm unable to play Co-Op as you obviously can't find yourself in matchmaking.

Of course you could refresh the quest, set up a new account and buy all games again, but that is a pain and also makes 'cross buy' games pointless.

If the devs could implement a workaround for this it would truly be a 5* game for me.","Sep 27, 2019 at 10:28 PM",4, 48,

Unfortunately the coop only has 4 levels and 2 of them aren't fun for me. Additionally you are unable to move around and interact with your friend, and its limited to just 2 players. It would be a lot more fun if you could do 3 or 4 players, and if there were more levels. Perhaps levels where you don't have to constantly circle around and look for cheap shot zombies all the time.

2022-05-28 13:56:41.838265,neilykins69,The best shooter on Oculus,"I've bought most of the zombie and shooter games on the Oculus, Arizona Sunshine, Brookhaven Experiment, all the gun range games, the gunfighting games (Drop dead, etc) and in my view this is the best shooter so far. Great enemies, great action, great cheesy storyline, plenty of missions, even the characters are amusing. Most importantly, the developers have avoided making ridiculous game ruining mistakes. For example, a single button to instantly align VR. Every single game should have the ability to instantly realign the VR view without using a menu. Yet game after game after game is ruined by making it impossibly awkward to realign yourself (The Golf Club VR hang your head in shame for making it literally impossible to get yourself next to the ball to play a shot). But there's more. Seated mode so you don't have to spend 20 minutes trying to set the right height? It's there on the menu at the right. Normal speed bullets rather than tennis-ball sized bullets moving at half-speed (like Drop Dead)? Sorted.

2022-05-28 13:56:57.682468,Goodbye_Kitty,Not a fan,"I bought this game at a price lower than 5euro so keep that in mind as you are reading this review.
Let this be clear : this is NOT an horror game, this is NOT an Arizona Sunshine game, a'right ? This is a railshooter with oldschool vibes,a superficial scoring system and cartoony graphics.
Difficulty ain't linear, at all. The first chronology (completed very fast) is nothing but a walk in the park, excepted 2 levels near the end which are WAY more difficult. Then the other chronology brings up the same maps but with new weapons, enemies and scenario. The game finally becomes interesting when you hit chronology 2, as the difficulty kicks in, and the game starts to look more like a die and retry game than a mini game for 12 year boys. But this is also where the flaws of the game start annoying you. VERY MUCH.
2 main issues in game : when I restarted more than twice a mission, I had to relaunch the game because there was a bug where I could not take a gun in hand anymore. And also... YOU CANT SKIP CUTSCENES. OH, MY, GOD. There is literraly this moment when you know the dialogues by heart. You can't do this. You can't make a game without a saving system if you don't allow people to skip cinematics. 
I don't regret buying it on sale, but I would have if I bought it full price.","Feb 10, 2018 at 1:33 AM",2, 11,
2022-05-28 13:56:57.703412,Mekalien,,"Drop Dead delivers exactly what the trailer is promising - a straightforward and fun rail shooter that comes with excellent gunplay and good controls.---

The graphics are really nice, nothing too fancy; but they will let you immerse in the scenario quickly. Drop Dead comes with a cartoonish look that is quite fitting for the lighthearted tone of the game.-----

The Touch controls work flawlessly and can be switched between right- and left-handed gun control. One hand controls the gun, gear and health potions are used with the other hand. Even people who are not familiar with VR, Touch controllers or even video games will get the hang of it very quickly. (You should see my dad...)-----

Soon you will feel like a true gunslinger, no matter if you decide to play safe and shower those zombies with a hail of bullets fired from the hip or take your time and aim downsight for a headshot. Which is quite precise, by the way.-----

Overall a really fun shooter, I have payed less than 6 Euro during a promotion and this actually feels like a steal. Even if I had payed the full 15 Euros I would not have been disappointed.-----

Sooo, why only 3 out of 5 stars, you might ask? Well, that is because of the german synchronisation. I really appreciate that there IS a german version, but to be honest; the german synchro is kind of underwhelming in comparison to the english version and I would LOVE to play DD in English. And I can't switch to english, no matter what, even deleting the game; switching the Oculus software to English and re-install the game has no effect.-----

This might look like a small thing, but it is kind of thoughtless and since I really do not like the german synchro (which is kind of lackluster and, even worse, quite often completey incorrect when you know what the NPCs say in the english version.-----

2022-05-28 13:56:57.720366,Insomnium,Worth it!,"Relatively straightforward rail shooter, with a nice selection of different weapons. The difficulty ramps up nicely, few last levels being quite challenging. Horde mode is nice, but I still haven't found a partner to try out the multiplayer aspect.


The gripes of the game are it's few bugs, sometimes not being able to take a gun, unskippable dialog  and the final boss bugged a few times for me. You might need to restart the game a few times during your playtrough, but nothing major.


All in all, a great singleplayer vr railshooter and easily worth the relatively low price. I paid $5 for this, but would not feel too bad if it was $20.

There are a few rough edges (like some of the environment textures and the fact the ground is about a foot too high), but it doesn't really detract from the fun.  I like the active reload mechanic for this type of fast-paced game and the fact that you actually have to aim without using laser sights as a crutch the whole time.  The waves seem spaced out well: I was never bored but my arms didn't really get tired either, which is nice.  Campaign seems like it will be longer than I expected; there are actually three sets of around 15 levels each which have repeat environments (tied in with the story) but different enemies and new/upgraded weapons each time so they don't really feel the same.

Lightgun games have always been short experiences but these games are all about getting high scores and ending up on the Leaderboard at the end of the day.

As well as the zombies there are also various props to shoot such as crows, bottles and pumpkins for bonus points so it's going to be a challenge to complete this game 100% because halfway through things started to get a bit hectic lol. Definitely worth purchasing!","Oct 14, 2017 at 6:15 AM",5, 5,

You're actually in a story,  front and center in a cartoonish zombie apocalypse romp and those zombies should be scared of you.  The cut scenes are done fantastically and they are just long enough to keep you entertained while you take a break from zombie killing.  But make no mistake, you're the main star in your action hero story, arcade style, guns ablazing.  And this game rewards precise shooting and quick thinking.  After finishing a level, I would often want to replay the same level to get an even higher score.  Not because I'm some sort of OCD completionist or achievement hunter, but because it's just a lot of fun to be this VR zombie ultra-killer and you notice things you could do even better next time.

It's an update of a Gear VR game, so the graphics aren't terribly impressive but at least they are polished and don't require a beefy system.

For some reason you will instantly lose if you accidentally shoot a civilian, or if the zombies get their hands on one. The world is infested with these murderous creatures but without the mountain backpappers we're all doomed apparently. Another gameplay element that almost drove me insane was the ""collect at least x number of limbs in order to complete level"". Doesn't matter if you beat the level with all perfect headshots, nope... Levels start to reappear at least three times with very small if any variation to them. What starts out as a fun and scary experiences later devolves into feeling like a job. Controls are somewhat messy when it comes to picking up objects in the game world. Too often you will die because of it. Anyway it's a pretty fun ride if you take it for what it is.

This MUST be a very hard thing to get right, since so few games attempt it, and fewer do it well, most preferring to fall back solely on video or ""radio"" communications with game characters. On the downside: 1) This is an ON RAILS experience, which not only takes some getting used to, but is not as immersive as free exploration. 2) You can only hold ONE weapon at a time 3) You can hit the big guys in the head 5 times in a row, but only the last hit is counted as a ""headshot"" 4) You can't keep weapons 5) You can't hit zombies with your guns between reloadings 6) You can't dodge projectiles 7) You can't move to a better vantage point. 8) When you replay a level, you have to watch its intro each time. 9) No dificulty levels.

1: The gun failures happen extremely consistent when the SHTF in survival mode. If a horde gets close the gun fails almost 100% of the time.

Love this game...,"Mar 24, 2017 at 9:07 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 13:57:29.327303,CaporalStevo,Basic but very fun!,Graphics are good but need better effects for headshot and zombie kills. I really like the confort mode and the fact action is in front of you. Ideal for fun with freinds at home ! 5 Stars considering the price :),"Mar 26, 2017 at 7:16 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 13:57:29.344259,FA1CO,Fun Game,"Im enjoying this game more then I expected to.. Pretty good graphics (for originally being a GearVR title), controls are easy and fun (w/touch), & a so so storyline, but overall I say its worth the price! I have spent more on worse games!  Only complaint is each level is way to short. I have not played multiplayer yet....","Mar 24, 2017 at 2:22 PM",4, 0,
