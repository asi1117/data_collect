2022-05-28 16:48:39.409144,Aquavemo,"Charming, colorful & creative puzzles...","...about houses? Why not! GNOG is a unique and imaginative ""diorama-like"" puzzle game. It contains nine fairly easy puzzles, each with its own theme. Find out what to do and watch a tiny (literally) story unfold. Just dont do them in one go but rather one each day. Like this I had puzzles to look forward to for over one week. Reasonable price too!","Aug 12, 2018 at 1:09 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 16:48:39.423106,nickladd,Beautiful Puzzler,"I picked the game up straight away based on the Double Fine name and simply because it looked gorgeous.  It's very short and not too challenging but it's still a creative and entertaining VR puzzle game.

Complaints though are ocassional moving scene/camera which can be a bit nauseating for first-timers and also that whenever you need to turn valves or crank things the controls become wonky and don't feel very precise or intuitive.","Jul 23, 2018 at 6:38 AM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 16:48:39.439064,Namr2000,A Joyous VR Experience,"GNOG is one of the most creative VR experiences available. Every corner of the game oozes with personality and pops with color. Even from the opening moments, the dazzling art style creates jaw dropping imagery that works especially well in a VR headset. The gameplay is somewhat similar to the “room exploration” genre of games (Job simulator), only at a much smaller scale. Each level is a monsters head that you can pop open to reveal the inside of the creatures mind, which is packed with knobs and dials that you must interact with to solve the level. While the game is ultimately a puzzler, the set pieces themselves are what bring the game alive, each step you make in solving a level has its own visual pop that is a joy to watch.
The game is brought down by its controls, which can be frustrating at times due to a lack of explanation. I found that turning dials was not immediately intuitive, but after you play the first few levels it becomes much less of an issue, and the overall experience makes up for the slight annoyance. The game is also a bit short, but every moment is memorable and at a $10 price point this is the easiest VR recommendation I can make.","Jul 19, 2018 at 1:35 AM",5, 3,

My Thoughts:
To learn that this cool puzzle solving game was from one of my all-time favorite developers 'Double Fine' was just the icing on the cake.
This is SUPERB!","Jul 25, 2018 at 1:09 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:48:42.583653,nrosko,,"I ike this little puzzle game. The design & art is very good, the puzzles themselves are not hugely challenging but there is enough here to keep it interesting & they are quite unique. Only on level 2 maybe it will get harder. But it really is about the whole experience. If you watch the videos it will give you an idea if you are going to enjoy the visuals & music. Not much content by the looks of it but i think price is fair & i hope the devs do more.","Jul 20, 2018 at 2:48 AM",5, 2,
