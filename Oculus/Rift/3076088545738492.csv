2022-05-28 16:42:17.002432,Ki-Tsu-Ne,I love it - thank you.,"I would really happy to have more interactions with Holo, she can be a good friend. I love kitsunés.
The japanese is not too hard.

Maybe Holo is a first step to become a future friend for lonely persons.","Apr 15, 2020 at 8:11 AM",5, 24,
2022-05-28 16:42:17.022378,taquitobuddy,Subtitled VN doesn't work well in VR,"Trying to read the subtitles really detracts from being able to appreciate the VR visuals.  Not a fan myself.  Also, the first two chapters had pretty bad writing, didn't get further than that.  My first and last VR VN.","Apr 2, 2020 at 9:48 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 16:42:17.036341,hbtm11,Thaks for making this.,"It is so cute that it is not unusual.
Although the main part is short, the soul is obsessed with the background and movement.
When a story is expressed in VR, it becomes such a world view. . .","Nov 15, 2019 at 10:52 PM",5, 10,

2022-05-28 16:42:17.065263,ismini,Not what I was expecting,"It's a pretty expensive pricetag for essentially a non-interactive VR episode of a cinematic anime that all takes place in one room. It was pretty and they did a good job with the character, but it was not worth the cost.  For less you can buy a game that will hold your attention longer, or a movie ticket with more content.","Jun 11, 2019 at 9:59 PM",1, 25,
2022-05-28 16:42:20.183922,arcticgamez,Must Buy Spice & Wolf VR for any fan,if your a fan of Spice & Wolf anime/manga/LN then you'll want to pick this up you get to head pat holo and brush her tail in the interact mode. game has 3 chapters each 10min long and is really well written small story along with the model motions being super smooth.,"Jun 3, 2019 at 5:37 PM",5, 37,
2022-05-28 16:42:20.198882,Kakuzen,Best for fans of Spice and Wolf,"This is a very cute (albeit short) experience for Oculus. It is a three-chapter story from the POV of Lawrence, with full voice acting from the original voice actors of the Spice and Wolf anime. After finishing the story, you unlock an ""interaction"" mode, where you are able to pet Holo, look at objects in the building and have her interact with them and hear her talk about them, and that's about it, honestly.

I thoroughly enjoyed it, but due to the experience's short length, with a very bare-bones interaction mode (you can pet her head and tail, or look at things), I would only recommend this for fans of the series. It's basically the closest to Season 3 fans will get at this point.

If you're not sure about this, I'd say to maybe pick it up in the future whenever it goes on sale. Fun, but not worth the price imho. $13-$15 would be the price point I'd pay for something of this length.","Jun 5, 2019 at 8:03 AM",4, 12,
2022-05-28 16:42:20.213842,utley,I absolutely adore S&W,"Im giving it 4 stars simply because this isnt all that big of a map or episode. However, its fun to have a little bit more of Holo and Lawrence in their adventures. For those who think the characters are drawn out of their original proportions, there are 3 different versions of the characters: the characters in the manga, the anime, and the light novels. The light novels are the characters portrayed in this episode, but its easy to understand why others are confused. I applaud the episode here and wish they do more of the same, but cant justify the $30 price tag for so little. Only those of us who have read the full series will be happy to pay the money. If you havent watched the anime series yet, I suggest doing so before watching this episode - but be warned: the anime is only 2 seasons and doesnt conclude at the end of season 2, and you would need to either read the manga or the light novel to finish. Well worth the read!","Jul 15, 2019 at 2:40 AM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 16:42:20.228802,ParadiseDecay,1st Impressions Video with Commentary!,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCSnzr_vT_k (Please Note: Links might not work from Oculus so please search YouTube for 'Paradise Decay VR Spice and Wolf')

My Initial Thoughts:
Great graphics and clever manga animation but I have to admit I'm not a big fan of this type of experience in VR. I got bored really fast. 
There is no real gameplay you simply watch a story unfold and once you unlock the game play elements it's very minimal. There is nothing really to do for the price they are asking and I have to admit I have never heard of this series or its characters so this might be one for the fans only.","Jun 3, 2019 at 11:05 PM",2, 20,
2022-05-28 16:42:20.243762,Laraloft,THE historical moment of VR anime,"This is it, the milestone of anime industry. It only has 3 episode, but it has demonstrated a great amount of stage effects that are only possible in VR. These techniques could potentially be documented in the textbook of anime making for virtual reality, and you shouldn’t miss the chance to witness the birth of this greatness.","Jun 13, 2019 at 2:06 PM",5, 1,
