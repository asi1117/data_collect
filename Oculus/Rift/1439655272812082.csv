2022-05-28 19:33:23.814034,byteframe,Looked bad and I was stuck in the floor.,I don't know if there was a novel idea that birthed this (maybe the dashing locomotion_ but otherwise its a hot mess of a tutorial level.,"Jun 7, 2021 at 11:30 PM",2, 7,
2022-05-28 19:33:23.828995,BiggestBoi,Kinda Sucks,"Ummm, well the movement is terrible, the menu is way to overdone, graphics and gameplay have terrible quality, and the weapons are completely garbage. Pls don’t waste space on this game.","Jun 6, 2019 at 8:34 PM",1, 40,

2022-05-28 19:33:26.995255,ArtoriasPlaysGames,Hm...,"See, I can totally feel the potentiol but.... needs a little more work. developer I love the idea. movement is a great way to be original. problem is the tutorial always fails to calibrate my height, I always remain a midget, and the graphics could use some work. but hey, they are descent. secondly the players need to keep an eye on this game. When the devs (Or dev) optimises the game A little we will want to know so that when that happens the servers arent blatantly empty. wouldnt reccomend playing YET but keep an eye on it. Cheers devs!","Mar 31, 2018 at 6:29 AM",3, 14,
2022-05-28 19:33:27.010215,Kazilik,Controls are difficult,"The game has potential, but the controls are difficult. Even if they weren't difficult, it is a very tedious way to move around. I would enjoy the game much more if it just has the option to move around with the stick. The menus are also a little confusing.","Mar 31, 2018 at 4:30 AM",3, 27,
2022-05-28 19:33:27.025175,caffeiNe209,"Good concept, needs work",Needs better controls (integrate more with touch controls i.e. being able to use your hand normally),"Apr 15, 2018 at 2:44 PM",2, 6,
