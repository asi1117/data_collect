2022-05-28 19:44:05.930000,OV3RT_,DO NOT BUY,"The game looks great, car looks great, racing aspect is great, BUT THE CONTROLS ARE HORRID, if ur using keyboard and mouse turning is way to sensitive and if ur using the oculus touch controllers u cant turn without braking","Feb 18, 2021 at 12:02 AM",1, 16,

2022-05-28 19:44:05.959920,Penri,horrible,"not worth a penny. terrible controls, terrible physics. oculus need to set some controls on quality before hosting","Aug 11, 2018 at 6:04 PM",1, 27,
2022-05-28 19:44:05.974880,TheLastChicken,I cant believe i PAID for this,It amazes me that an app with that bad of controls and support with the oculus touch controllers can even be on the market. On key board the turning is way to sensitive and on touch controllers the car will just start braking when you turn. If im missing some game mechanic atleast put a tutorial in,"Jul 7, 2018 at 5:45 AM",1, 38,

2022-05-28 19:44:09.072723,theregoes2,UX is not good,"It appears that there are three courses to drive on. The racing part isn't terrible and the inside of the car looks good enough, but it seems that you can't make selections with any buttons on the controller. You have to use gaze input and it's really, really slow. I tried one course and then deleted the game. It needs more work before it's ready.","Oct 20, 2017 at 7:52 AM",2, 29,We added an option for faster option selecting using the controller buttons in the 1.1 update which is now live. As well as other game improvements.
