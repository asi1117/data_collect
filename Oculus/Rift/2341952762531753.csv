A game about relaxed free-exploration should NOT have an intense comfort rating like this. I highly recommend to the developer: please add teleportation, the ability to freely walk around in roomscale, or at the very least, give the player camera ""tunnel vision"" while moving to reduce the motion sickness. However, after I forced myself through the motion sickness, I found other mechanics quite enjoyable, especially the sequence where a rocket is launched during the tutorial. The belt, as it turns out, also has the ability to attach objects to it, though at times, the physically simulated attachment could get in the way. Perhaps change that to a more solid connection the way hats are? I eventually got to the start of the actual game- I can tell that sigificantly more love was put into the environment than the game's basic controls. While it isnt the most polished, as the former developer of a similarly un-polished passion project I am not as bothered by this fact because i understand the possibly quite legitamate reasons behind that. (talented artists are very, very expensive!)

So, that all said, I hope to see some updates to this game which might improve the motion sickness issues- that way, I bet more people will enjoy it, and more people will buy it when they hear how enjoyable it is!

As it stands right now; the game is unplayable due to the extreme motion sickness it induces. thats a shame- i really want to explore it more","Apr 13, 2020 at 10:54 AM",4, 10,
2022-05-28 18:44:46.374549,jedwards123321,Looks interesting but NEEDS SNAP TURNING,I want to like this game but I literally could not even get through the introductory tutorial before I was immensely nauseous and HAD to quit.  It really needs to support snap-turning like most other games.  PLEASE.,"May 31, 2020 at 9:06 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:44:46.389509,Siegfriedshead,"It's cool, but makes me sick","The game needs:
.Snap turning
.The head bobbing that happens when you walk over train tracks needs to be removed.
.Other locomotion options.

An in-game backpack wouldn't hurt too because constantly holding things because you can only put two things on your harness is really annoying, but it's the comfort settings that really need to be fixed before this is playable.","Apr 8, 2020 at 12:17 PM",3, 4,
2022-05-28 18:44:46.406463,FastLawyer,Nice escape room,"I had fun, but this game is very limited. It's an escape room where you fall into an underground cavern and abandoned mine and have to figure out how to get back to your camp. The puzzles are simple. You have full lomomotion and smooth turning. Interactions are simple, but overall clunky. There's collision issues, clipping, and just some bugs (like being catapulted way up in the air when crossing the moving platform). Game takes 20-30 minutes to complete. The best part of this game was the mine cart ride around the camp. I bought it on sale for $2 and think I got my money's worth.

2022-05-28 18:44:46.421423,Arnookie,This certainly has lots of promise. 😊,"This game heads you off along a mountain pass that passes near the old mines. You need to find your way through the game with a limited set of items you can pick up and carry. 
You will find yourself within the mine looking for a way to escape. You have the use of a pickaxe and torches and several other items that you will need to collect along your journey. 
Finding puzzles along the way and the use of Items is cleverly done to solve each problem. 
The game has great graphics with a nice atmosphere and some great visuals. 
The game runs into some slight issues that can cause a bit of frustration. But with regular check points that you can reload at anytime help overcome these issues. I had a couple of problems with controling a platform machine within the game and items falling into the ground and vanishing.  Overall I still enjoyed the game and the experience was fun. After communicating  with the developer I understand that we can expect more to be added to the game. Overall a decent game you could loose an hour in easily. I can't wait to see what more the dev brings to this game. 😊👍","Jan 25, 2020 at 9:40 AM",4, 24,
2022-05-28 18:44:49.561026,Lalle75,"Cannot stand it, made me sick.","I like these slow games where you can explore and enjoy the atmosphere. But this game makes me feel very sick. No snap turn, no teleporting and a very strange feeling of movement made my stomach turn upside down after 5 minutes.","Mar 12, 2020 at 3:06 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:44:49.575987,OversizeWizard,Seems ok,"Seems OK.  As I only lasted 5 mins.  Movement turning made me feel sick real fast.
Give it another go again another time.","Mar 15, 2020 at 1:48 AM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 18:44:49.604909,808_ant_w,Very fun and interesting to explore.,"Hopefully more gets added soon, as this game has a very interesting design and playthrough. I had fun running it through","Mar 3, 2020 at 7:48 AM",5, 1,
