I do agree tho, if you liked animal crossing that this would be the VR game semi like that, just not as cool.  But unfortunately,  yes it is repetitive and therefore gets boring.","Aug 4, 2020 at 9:22 PM",4, 39,

Yet, If you love achievements and the feeling of satisfaction that comes from completing a game, I can tell you right now...DON'T buy this game. This is great for casual relaxation....If you can stand the motion mechanics of this game. There is no teleport feature. 

When you reach the big milestone in the game, it can be confusing. ""That was it?"" might cross your mind once the credits roll. The game is not a top VR experience since the game feels incomplete compared to their other VR titles like Brasstactics. The characters in the game come off as cute but later get annoying since they don't have dialogue. Strong start with the early tutorial but by the end, the game drops off and your on your own to figure things out. 

Would recommend for those who need a group game or prefer wholesome themes.","May 21, 2020 at 2:53 PM",3, 7,

this game is the most nauseating game i have ever played. i usually have zero problems with nausea at all, i play plenty of stick movement games. This game had me quit in minutes.

i'd take a guess that a lot of people who buy this game have not played many other VR games, it's the type of game that attracts the non-gamer playerbase.

My wife doesn't have her VR legs, she had to sit down after about 10 seconds in this game. you guys really NEED a teleport mode, the lack of this feature insures a high percentage of people who will buy this game will NEVER play it.","May 4, 2020 at 12:23 PM",1, 7,

Biggest one is the default player height is way too short, and feels super weird. The devs have said this is intentional, but it's not ideal, and the game would greatly benefit from a player height option. Plus, the Nyms are way cuter when you have to bend down to pet them. You can fix it by crouching when you reset the camera, but it gets reset every time you go indoors so you have to keep doing it.

It could also really use a teleport feature. I'm ok with the locomotion as it is, but a lot of reviews are complaining about nausea.","Feb 23, 2020 at 1:11 PM",3, 17,

The daily fountain is fair, and rewards are often leaving its touch, although some quests do in fact confuse. Especially making something for chicken is something that leaves a lot to figure out as what it really demands you. 
 
One star for poop invasion. Where is the fun when you can't toss the squishily voiced dolls to water or lava or even ""accidentally"" run near them with pickax or ax.

I paid £11 for this, there were no in-game options to adjust position, and I seemed to be a foot tall in it. It was far too uncomfortable to play for more than two minutes. Is two minutes of this worth £11? No. No, it isn't.

2022-05-28 14:13:24.387407,wineinacan,,"I have spent so much time in this game. It went under my radar when it first came out but thought I would try it out after all the amazing reviews and it feels like a steal even at it's current price.

The locations are varied and there is plenty to do. The grinding to get items didn't feel like a chore and the progression is very well paced. There were a couple of road blocks but they did feel satisfying once you figured them out.

The only downsides to my whole journey to completion was the poop issue. If you hurt an animal, they can drop poop which stays for the rest of the game. I have one in my whole island because I turned around with an axe in my hand and hit a bunny that snuck up behind me. There should be a way to get rid of them like giving it extra affection or the item it requires to get it to disappear.","Aug 24, 2019 at 9:50 AM",5, 28,
2022-05-28 14:13:24.402367,VecZ,Beautifully Made,"Racoon Lagoon is a curious and perfectly paced adventure game that I would reccomend to any VR user. It is easy to learn and fun to play. The soundtrack is a masterpiece and the art is magical and radiant. The only small problem I have with this game is the multiplayer, it isnt bad but it is inconvineint. If you play while on another players island, it is hard to progress through the game together because you dont share certain upgrades and abilities. Other than that, this game is a perfect representation of what a VR adventure game should be.","Jul 26, 2019 at 10:41 AM",5, 60,
2022-05-28 14:13:27.494277,Desynchronize,Beautiful experience. Very engaged devs!,"If you can't sow seeds, try placing them one at a time instead of in a stack.  Seems obvious, but totally tripped me up.  Just before I figured out what the issue was, I reached out to report a bug, and the devs replied within an hour or two.  I greatly appreciate highly engaged developers who take support seriously!

Loads of fun.  Plays like a mashup of animal crossing and harvest moon, while remaining original and itself.  You're the only humanoid character, a god of sorts, except if you play multiplayer.  The creatures of the island are very life-like, are very well animated and don't at all come across as just passive NPCs.  They have shifting desires and most of the higher intellegence creatures have things they do to pass their day.  Very easy to get swept up in exploration and resource gathering and the game keeps you shifting resources so you're not just mindlessly grinding one item forever.  

I'd really like to see a way to dispose of excrement as it appears to be permanent and it's easy to accumulate if you're not careful around creatures or if you play multiplayer.  I also think the game could benefit from a few ""tip"" signs to avoid confusion on topics like sowing and cooking.  

Pointless side thoughts: I'd love if there was an upgradeable player house and at least a couple humanoid NPC's so the player wasn't the only of their kind on the island to give a greater feeling of belonging.  But the whole island is very customizable, and all the creatures (minus those pesky raccoons!) are friendly and interactive.

One of the most comfortable enviroments to lose yourself in, and easily one of my favorite games on Oculus.","Sep 5, 2019 at 1:06 PM",5, 6,

2022-05-28 14:13:27.540154,Masamune5454,Beautiful cuddly Axe throwing.,"1.being able to eat and drink. even more than just that i would love a survivalish mode, where you had hunger and thirst and had to sleep. instead of dying you would just get sleepy and fall asleep. that would be awsome.
2.more content, i havent finished the game yet but this one i know i want more of. i could mine and chop trees for days. also the cute characters and zelda esque stores are just too cool. more items to buy and you main island getting bigger would be a start. (stores are upgradable along with other structures)
 but alas i did feel left out. working hard to make the island people happy, i thought for sure i would be able to make my own home and decorate it. thats when i started to kinda ween away from the game. theres items like a floor and fencing, but no real way to build a home, which was a huge bummer. i feel they should have just used the parts and make them snap together to build it. same with the ranch, i have to place the fencing down and half the time they wont go where i want, and if i put them on a wooden floor, everything falls apart if i go to pull something out of my inventory. for some reason it grabs the floor instead of your item and suddenly youve messed up all this work. a snap together feature along with a way to not upheave the floor or walls everytime you go to feed a chicken would make it much better. then theres the fact that these items just feel like props, by that i mean theyre small, and they dont stop animals from coming through it (what good does the fence do here) and its even required to build it to move on that characters story. then we have the chest issue. i havent had my chest dissapear but i have 9 right now, and ive heard others have disappeared. which just knowing it might is awfully sketch. will i lose hours of hard work when i load back up. 
it doesnt capture harvest moons homey feeling, and people can come in and whack your animals and they leave poo behind if they do, and it cant be removed! Still good...","Jul 31, 2019 at 11:52 AM",4, 25,Thanks for playing the game and updating your review. Then entire island is your home.

2022-05-28 14:13:27.556112,LiverKing,"Great game, but maybe wait for teleport","Really enjoying the game each time I try to get into it; the visuals look amazing and the gameplay perfectly scratches that 'taking a relaxing break from the real world' itch VR seems to be perfect for. 

But the lack of teleportation has me quit each session after only a few minutes due to a slight, nagging dizziness. It's clear that this game aims for easy-to-get-into relaxation, but for many (potential) players, having only smooth movement will currently place an entirely unnecessary 'VR-legs only' hurdle in the way of enjoying that experience.","Aug 17, 2019 at 9:19 PM",3, 15,

Beyond that, though, is a major sticking point for me. I've reached out to the developer multiple times, and they refuse to even consider the teleportation movement option which is a MUST for me and many other players. I'm writing this review to highlight these two points: DO NOT BUY if you need teleport movement to not get motion sickness, and the dev HAS NO PLANS to add it.","Aug 11, 2019 at 7:47 AM",2, 15,
2022-05-28 14:13:30.691363,Vanilord,Interesting Alpha,"The game seems interesting but has a lot of problems :

- there is no possibility to reset the position, and you often find yourself too low or too high (oculus reset does not work)
- No locomotion option : no reduced vision as you move forward, no teleportation. For someone who is not used to RV, it is very difficult to play it without feeling nauseous.
- Disconnection problems in multiplayer
Synchronization problems (I see that the fountain asks for 9 flowers when it asks my friend for 2), and it is validated when he adds 2 flowers
- The progression is not shared (to unlock the tools for example) which makes the game very constraining (having to repeat each action twice)

Otherwise, the game is cute and the music is pleasant","Jul 28, 2019 at 3:43 AM",2, 6,Thank you for playing Raccoon Lagoon and for taking the time to write a review. You can recenter yourself by clicking both the thumbsticks anytime in game. We did intentionally put the character closer the ground than most games.

2022-05-28 14:13:30.737240,Doc_Reaper,"Fun, Cute and Easy to play","This is a good game to relax with. So first the bad:
The locomotion was a little uncomfortable as you are kind of floating everywhere instead of the short teleport in alot of other vr games. I would say to be seated when you first start playing to avoid too much stress on your equilibrium. Also the raccoons refresh in the same spot i think it would add more spontaneity if they were in different locations sometimes. Sometimes I didn't really fully get what was going on in the pre-game and post-game mosaics, but for the most part it made sense. Finally the poop. If you run into any animals, or just try to move them out of the way too agressively they poop. It doesnt go away either. Trying to throw it over the mountains and in the water it just comes back. I havent found a way to dispose of poop, and i think its the only thing that really frustrates me. It has no purpose other than to punish you for not trying to run around the animals, or for just handling them too aggressively. Which is understandable, but maybe dont make it permanent please. lol. 
None of these things made me regret getting the game though.
For the good:
I really enjoyed the game. Chopping tree's and mining ore was pretty interesting at first, but admittedly gets a little redundant, but also gets easier as you upgrade your equipment. The creatures are funny, and cute, and I really like that you are upgrading them along with the village. I saw someone say it was like animal crossing and I agree. I definitely got that vibe. Theres alot to do until there isn't, but until then its a great game. :)","Aug 13, 2019 at 9:51 PM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 14:13:33.836063,stickypig,Fun game! No cross save.,"Got weirdly addicted to this game that I bought for my friends that want to try VR but don't want to fight screaming zombies. Played on Quest and was excited to try out a hopefully smoother experience on PC but discovered there's no cloud save so I either start a whole new game (not gonna do it) or just stick to the Quest. Cross buy without cloud really stinks, but that's not a problem exclusive to this game.","Aug 6, 2019 at 2:35 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 14:13:33.852021,Pinworm45,Not bad,"Not bad, fairly enjoyable. Kids will probably love it. There seems to be a fair amount to do, although after a few hours I started to feel tinges of repetition.

One thing I'd like to see is a way to differentiate between ""repeatable"" quests and ""real"" quests. IE there will be ""quests"" that give hearts and rewards, but lots of animals will also exchange 1 type of supply for another. It can get annoying keeping track of which type of quest an animal is giving. Maybe make ""exchange"" repeatables a different color?

The game could also use some more options. Both some graphics (the game uses Unreal 4 so there should be some options for the graphics, they're built into UE4. Improving the aliasing for example, should be an option for the player).

Those who aren't comfortable with smooth locomotion should beware for now. There's no teleportation and minimal effects like Vignette. Personally the game uses the system I like - smooth locomotion with smooth turning. Snap turning is also an option. But that's about it for VR options.

Also this is a bit minor but somethinbg about the way the ""storm"" system works rubs me the wrong way. Basically every once in a while a storm will start and after a few seconds the screen will fade to black, then fade back in, and all the resources will be respawned. I get this was done to allow respawning resources, but the way it just randomly fades out and back in.. It's just a bit weird to me. It's hardly a big deal but every time it happens it makes me wish it was done differently, like maybe when a storm starts you have to get home to a bed. I don't know. It's minor

Overall it's a fun game and these are relatively minor issues.","Jul 31, 2019 at 3:08 AM",4, 3,

The height ""problem"" is easily solved by simply sitting on the ground and then pressing both joysticks in. This puts your height much higher up for when you stand and play. There isn't a teleport option available right now, but this game still couldn't make me motion sick. Maybe adding a very subtle bobbing or walking motion would help simulate movement, but it's fine for now. I would really enjoy a game like this but in a more ""stranded deep"" style of open crafting and open world building as like..a sandbox mode or multiplayer mode. The game so far is fantastic.","Aug 16, 2019 at 9:45 AM",5, 1,

It was very disappointing that it doesn't have a teleport mode because I get really bad motion sickness when a game only has walking mode. If you are able to do walking mode, then the game will be so perfect for you! It's so cute, and it gives me Animal Crossing vibes! I'm really disappointed, and I will have to return the game.

The Rift S version is sharp and colourful with many things to do. From fishing to mining. You're helping out a butch of maroon sailors get back on their feet. As you go on shops open up and other areas. Watch my first play through on the Rift S plus Quest. https://youtu.be/GeUtmRRfePU","Jul 27, 2019 at 10:42 PM",5, 5,

I""M IN!!","so i started out looking through the store for the newest games, or at least another game. came across this. ill tell you, NOT initially my type of graphical game (or so i thought by the preview video) but saw the early reviews and figured, ""theyre ALL either idiots. or theres SOMETHING ""here""/ THERES SOMETHING HERE

beautiful art style. wonderful music and an ambiance that puts you squarely there, all the game mechanics work brilliantly and NO REFUNDING HERE!","Jul 26, 2019 at 1:59 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 14:13:37.056553,Frek77,Easy going animal crossing type game,"Plays a lot like animal crossing. Their are various animals about who each want something. Some just want something simple, some want you to build a house. There are various tools you collect and can upgrade. You actually ""use"" the tools, swing the axe, pick ore nodes, etc.

The beginning part of the game does a very good job of easing you into the gameplay.

The animals are very cute and can be petted. There are lots of different items, even different types of trees, fruit, ores, plants, fish and so on.

I played for about 2 hours and did not encounter any bugs or problems. System played on: AMD 2700X, GTX 1070 Ti, 16 GB Ram. If I do encounter any problems I will update my review.

If you have played a game like animal crossing, you will enjoy this game. As I said, I am about 2 hours into the game and it does feel like I have only scratched the surface of the content.","Jul 26, 2019 at 11:18 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 14:13:37.072511,Minitonyo,Lovely and beautifull game,I've been playing this game on Oculus Rift for 20 hours so far and counting. If you want to complete the game 100% it will take more than 50 hours for sure. Very entertaining game and friendly developers. :D,"Aug 4, 2019 at 7:45 PM",5, 8,

Also for some reason I cant go to my girlfirends world on her quest when im using my rift and I thought this was supposed to be cross play.,"Jul 27, 2019 at 11:58 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 14:13:40.175040,ericle7,Superbly made and endlessly engaging,"I found this game more captivating than I was expecting.  It's way too easy to get absorbed into exploring the very nicely rendered world, and collecting all the trinkets.  It's especially fun to play with a friend - a rare truly co-op VR experience.","Aug 6, 2019 at 12:05 PM",5, 3,
