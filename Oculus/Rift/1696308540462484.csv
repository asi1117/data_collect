2022-05-28 14:57:19.255086,Roy.Crawford,Pure Mining Fun,"Very simple game with lots of rock bashing [as you would expect], however the mines can get boring, and there isn't a lot of new content you get after around 40 minutes of play. Still fun however.","Feb 5, 2021 at 12:37 PM",4, 8,
2022-05-28 14:57:19.270046,Rivondo75,Fun game,"It's fun, but there is no menu or instructions. Kinda ""here's a pickaxe, start swingin' it, kid."" There are lots of subtle tips if you listen to the guy on the radio. The people on the radio are very good. Lots of story to listen to. Overall, it's an alright game. Pick it up when it's on sale. The rundown:
+ good voice work
+ simple rock bashing fun
+ lots of pretty things to pick up
+ can upgrade the town and tools
- no tool tips or brief explanation for town upgrades, tools, etc
- no instructions, tutorial, or menu
- some clipping issues; Get stuck on objects or Mimi (who is frequently at your hip), so you have to lean or step aside to get unstuck","Oct 25, 2020 at 7:08 AM",4, 21,

2022-05-28 14:57:25.559224,ON8CB,Risk of injuries or breaking the Touch,"This game should not be listed, it is dangerous because it makes you play outside the Guardian fence, I have hit several times the walls and the monitor in front of me because the game area is larger than the fence. Risk of injuries or breaking the Touch is extremely high. 
It should be in the Terms and Conditions for Developers to ensure that safety is taken in consideration.
The game itself is basic, hit the rock, collect the gems before the time is over, buy useless tools and don't use the atomic bomb or otherwise the game is over. There should be an option to enable/disable or decide the length of the timer and also gems which are already in the elevator should not disappear. Not worth the price.","Jun 7, 2019 at 3:55 PM",1, 27,
2022-05-28 14:57:25.574184,Nonebetter,Super fun - also funny!,"The narration is funny, game looks great too.
Overall a great game, fun for hours under the right circumstances, its so easy to play you can hop in it anytime for a quick VR warmup.
Practice and get to the point where you can harvest whole rooms, oil, special items, set goals for yourself, earn money, collect shineys.
Super fun easer eggs too if you figure out how to use them, mushrooms, LSD trips, geckos in the distance, etc...
Also a great game to show off to VR noobies, its easy to learn and you can pick it up in just a few seconds/minutes, very simple","Mar 26, 2019 at 7:20 AM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 14:57:25.589144,damoran,Fun for about 10 minutes,"I wouldn't mind the base mechanics of the game. However, why did they have to put it on a timer. You rush around trying to get all the gemstones and treasure but hardly have time to really use any of the more advanced mining tools. I have about 25 SF of play space and found it pretty inadequate for this game, I kept running into walls and getting tangled in the headset cord as it has you spinning around constantly. After a while I stopped trying to use any of the other tools since I didn't have time to figure them out before I shot back up to the surface so yeah, about 10 minutes using the pickaxe, buying the rest of the tools you won't have time to use and collecting the glove pieces from Avengers Infinity war.","Mar 15, 2019 at 12:49 AM",2, 15,
2022-05-28 14:57:28.675889,Dovahkiin77,Inmersive 10/10,"The idea behind the game is very simple, but it works for me. Awesome graphics and very well fit for small rooms. 
I got impressed when i discovered that the pickaxe actually meassures the strength you use to hit the rocks, and I love it. Had a lot of fun breaking those walls.
I didnt feel motion sickness at all, which is very nice in a VR game. After an hour playing It feels a bit repetitive but its good as a party game with friends.  
All in all, awesome graphics, great food (mushrooms) and a good chance to free some energy and sweat.
WAITING FOR SOME NEW CONTENT ;)","Oct 16, 2018 at 6:59 PM",4, 23,
2022-05-28 14:57:28.690849,WheezyHeen,"Fun experience, not worth the price tag","EDIT: Since my review was the first and is at the top, let me update by saying that some of the reviewers below have suggested that the bugs I hit may have been patched.

A fun and whimsical mining experience that the developers have obviously enjoyed making. Unfortunately with how short it is and how many bugs I encountered on my short journey - and especially considering some of the other content that is out there for the same price (1900 JPY for me) - I can't recommend it for the cost. Remember though, this is an expansion to a free version that is available on steam, so try it there if you think it might be something you are interested in.

I've given the game 3 stars, as I got a free key from the developers, and it was a fun experience for free. I reached one of the endings within an hour, but there is definitely some room for replay if you want to find all the content.

Below are all minor issues, but my advice to the devs is to work on the controls a bit more. I'm not sure if it was originally vive controls, but the inability to point my index finger made trying to point and grab things from afar very frustrating. It was also difficult to try to slot things into my ""belt"", so I ended up hanging everything on the walls, but I would have liked to keep things more clutter free by utilizing the belt more.

The controls also bugged out three times during my 1 hour playthrough, and I had to restart the game each time to fix it. One of the bugs was when I held onto a gem as the elevator returned to the surface. The usual symptoms when it is bugging out is that grabbing things doesn't bring them into your hand, and you can only hold onto them for one second or so before they are automatically released. It also prevented me from buying any new items at the store.

To summarize, I think you guys have a good thing going, and although I don't think it is ready for a price tag yet, I look forward to seeing how you improve it in the future!","Oct 19, 2018 at 7:49 PM",3, 16,

2022-05-28 14:57:28.721766,2bDetermined,Fun but slow difficult movement,The movement/turning has almost like a weird cooldown that makes that game hard to navigate and not get frustrated with. Especially because you spend the entire game on an elevator and need to turn quickly sometimes like when you manage to get stuck in the corner of the elevator and all you can see is the empty wall. The price isn't fully worth it either.,"Nov 5, 2018 at 12:41 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 14:57:28.736726,vr_and_chill,"MAMA, I AM A DIGGER NOW!","First I had a bit rough time to sort out things with the controllers but after I used to that I dig the hell out of it! IT'S TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY AND I'M LOVING IT! 

I enjoyed the environment and especially mushrooms :D  The tools are funny, you don't just dig around- you also come up to solve some mysteries and game has a really sick humour ( You will understand what I say when you reach one of the endings :D)  

Can't wait to see what else the devs will bring the game! 
I recommend you to play this with your friends :)","Oct 16, 2018 at 4:50 PM",5, 10,
2022-05-28 14:57:31.816488,ruibalp,,"Neat concept, but the turning controls could use a bit of work.   They only seem to work like 30% of the time.","Dec 8, 2018 at 3:51 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 14:57:31.831449,Creolucis,Doesn't live up to the expectations,"First startup of this game and you're thrown right into the shaft elevator below ground. You start hacking away on the rocks, but quickly change your technique to spasming you hand back and forth. You know, for effiency.


There is some fun oddities, a mystery door that needs keys and several endings.

Too bad the game started bugging, items flying all over the place, getting stuck behind a board on the elevator or lost completely. 

I kinda expected more out of this. I see how much work that was put into this, but it doesn't live up.","Sep 16, 2018 at 9:41 PM",2, 13,
2022-05-28 14:57:31.846408,Jennyjangles,Fun but a bit buggy,"I had a great time smashing my virtual picaxe against the rocks. You get to unlock/buy loads of different tools which I found enjoyable. 
My criticism is that there were a lot of bugs. 
For example, there are some areas around your waist where you can hand your tools, but some of mine ended up inside my RL body and I couldn't reach them. Also, the turning around system only worked some of the time, so often I was left racing the wrong direction.

A good game, but needs some polish!","Sep 29, 2018 at 10:37 PM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 14:57:31.862366,Batmanhattan,Fun adventure in VR world,"Gameplay
The game is in its core about breaking rocks in the mine to get valuables to sell for buying tools and progressing by finding special objects in the mines (no spoiler what things but they're linked with game endings). There’s many tools to buy from a shop. You can for example whack your way through with a pickaxe, buy dynamite and blow rocks apart or punch your way through to gold, gems and fossils like old iconic Nokia phone (yes the one with legendary Snake). There’s more enigmatic objects hidden in the game world so it involves a bit of a mystery-solving too.

Competitive mode
There’s a separate comp mode alongside a normal mode. Haven't done the comp mode much yet but looks like it’s about ten levels mining run with all the tools at your disposal and try to mine maximum amount in given time. Then the lift takes you back up to the surface to see if you could make it to the leaderboards.

Endings, replay value
There’s seven endings in total of which I have found four now. Without wanting to spoil the endings, one was pretty obvious. You’d probably guess before “doing the thing”. Others then came totally out of the blue. The devs announced that they’ll release new content for next Halloween for free. Props to devs, not that many do that anymore these days without slapping a price tag on it. All in all, the game has great amount of replay value in endings and if you’d like to take mining challenge in the competitive mode, you’ll get many hours more. I can also see potential in CD:R for a party game because of its short rounds and entertaining gameplay. Also the game is family-friendly should you play it with family.

Why I deducted a star
I found a few bugs but not any game-breaking with my about five hours of gameplay so far unlike the other reviewer had faced. Maybe devs have patched them. I agree that the tool belt is useless because using it tends to end up in a hassle so instead I use the hanging hooks to organize tool arsenal. -1 star because those.","Sep 13, 2018 at 6:13 PM",4, 14,
