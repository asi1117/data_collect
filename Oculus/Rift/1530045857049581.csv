2022-05-28 17:51:00.669130,ToastyPanda,"Like the concept, but 360 is too blurry.",I like the general concept of the news room and all of the 360 experiences...but my main issue with anything 360 is the camera quality is so low that anything beyond 4 feet away is too blurry to bother watching. At that quality Id rather watch the same video on a 2D screen with HD. More of a technology/price restriction that prevents a VR App for news from being viable yet.,"May 24, 2020 at 5:16 AM",3, 0,

2022-05-28 17:51:03.857603,DrHobo,Interesting.,"I like the format and the program runs well but there's too little news, a dozen clips at most. There are many more 360 degrees videos, some of which are very interesting but, understandably, there is not a lot rotation on them.  Twitter triggerring on the controls are nicely done but not always working.","Sep 1, 2018 at 9:13 PM",4, 5,
2022-05-28 17:51:03.875554,RayRift,,"Meh. It's a rather pedestrian fake news dashboard where you can select from a very limited asortment of low quality outdated 360 propaganda videos. There are no dates on the headlines. It's just some pretty much rando, recordings they were able to produce. It makes me want to design a REAL VR news experience. How about we all get together and build INFOWARS VR?","Jun 18, 2018 at 5:33 AM",1, 51,
2022-05-28 17:51:03.891512,PerDoops,Flat out doesn't work,"I've been trying to broaden my VR experiences past gaming, so this piqued my interest. A mainstream news company must have poured quite a bit of money into the development of a VR app right? Well, it definitely doesn't seem that way.

Whenever I launch this application, I'm placed into a pretty cool, sci-fi looking room. The Touch controllers have a nifty skin to go along with the aesthetics of the room. A hexagonal loading indicator loads in front of me, an exclamation point appears within it, and then...nothing.

That's literally it. An empty room with a loading indicator and then...a quest marker? An error message (with no text)? Who is to say. There's nothing beyond the exclamation mark. All of the Touch buttons do nothing besides the Oculus button taking me back out of the program.

 It's a cool, empty room if you'd like to be alone with your thoughts I guess, but I wanted something beyond that, like a VR news experience. Uninstalling.","May 12, 2018 at 3:33 AM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 17:51:06.974267,v2020,"No 3D? Only 2D videos, some 360?","The app is fine, albeit scrolling thourgh videos should be faster (more streamlined), you should be able to see titles in the list already. Form over function. ----

Content - yet another 360 flat video platform. It could have been part of YouTube content, at least interface there is much better (even if looking less flashy). ----

This offering is correctly working, but I expected cutting edge from CNN. Something on the level of quality that Felix&Paul offer. Too heavy for web streaming? Go 180 deg then... ---- 

Yeah, there's that news ticker. Much wow ;)","Mar 19, 2018 at 6:38 AM",2, 4,

2022-05-28 17:51:07.019146,Bel-garath,"Great Potential, needs improvements","I really like where this is going. However, there needs to be better sorting, by date, by topics (sports, finance, politics, etc). The video quality is average, but like others have said there is no buffering. I don't have much interest in watching the news on a bigger screen. I'm more interested in the 360 videos, but the angles are horrible and the motion on some of them is going to make people sick. Why am I always 20 feet above ground? If it was more ground level, that would help.  Anyway, there are some very interesting stories and to be able to see some of these across the world sites and events in 360 degrees even if its not really VR is amazing. I hope this app improves, because we need more of this sort of thing.","Mar 17, 2018 at 3:26 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 17:51:07.034106,FastLawyer,"Cool, exciting future but no killer app","It is exciting that CNN thinks enough of VR to make this app and to put recent news clips on here. And I haven't even seen one advertisement yet! So that's pretty awesome. However, I'm not sure that viewing this in VR is any better than just viewing online (other than the no ads thing). I have CNN on my Sling app, so I really don't need this. There are some 360 VR videos. They are cool. It just needs more of a reason to be in VR. I can't imagine anyone being in VR so much that they have to get their news clips from VR. Honestly, the headset is NOT that comfortable to be going to those lengths. And I play VR very often. But I try to save my time in VR for actual games or unique experiences that I can't get anywhere else. Still, it is nice that a major news corporation thinks enough of Oculus and VR users to make this.","Mar 16, 2018 at 11:29 PM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 17:51:10.164733,PowerOfTheSchwartz,This app truly rocks!,"Put your politics aside.  Install this app and get inspired on how the future of VR navigation (for non-games) should work.  Also, lots of great inspiration watching 360 videos (if you are a creator like me).  Amazingly great job CNN!","Mar 16, 2018 at 9:15 PM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 17:51:10.180691,RuneSR2,Awesome way to watch news,"Easy access to interesting news stories - you can choose a sphere among others containing a news story and activate a video. Some stories are displayed on a big screen, others are 360 degrees videos. There are some older news stories among quite new stories - some just a few minutes old. Would be nice if it was possible to watch the CNN TV channel without having to actively choose subjects, but otherwise this app is my reference for watching news in VR. Works nicely using super-sampling 2.0 on a GTX 1080. Thank you, CNN!","Mar 16, 2018 at 6:18 AM",5, 9,

2022-05-28 17:51:10.209613,ubu-roi,It's a start,"Yeah, it's pretty simple, but it's a start I guess. They really need to reimagine what the news experience is, though.  I can watch CNN videos through any number of other apps, where I can also do other things.  So, CNN, why are people going to go to your VR app when the only thing it does is act like a 2D screening room with some 360 video?  You really need to offer something that people cannot get anywhere else.","Mar 27, 2018 at 5:17 AM",3, 4,

2022-05-28 17:51:13.325279,Kevin_Brook,It's alright.,"As 360 video experiences go this isn't bad. Video quality is decent and there's some new content. The feature videos are 360 degree, but not VR, there is no 3d stereoscopic so the scale looks off. But it's not pixelated at least, and I experienced no buffering.
There are some latest clips as well, including the bridge collapse from this evening, that display on a big screen in front of you. As it's American, and I'm from the UK the content probably isn't interesting enough to get me  to laod it up again, but it's not bad, and if you like watching videos in VR (I don't) then you may get a lot out of it.","Mar 16, 2018 at 8:35 AM",4, 2,

old review:
so i grab a tile (grip button) and place the video tile on a globe.. when i release a button it snaps back to its original location. i tried place it on a globe + all button combinations - the same - just snaps back to its original location. So.. how do you actually play a video? btw tutorial only tells you "" place tile on a globe"" and waits for you to do that... no help there..","Mar 18, 2018 at 6:27 PM",4, 1,

The well crafted story library is interesting, fun and touching with a wide range of subjects from watching the beautiful solar eclipse to the grim images of family digging up their dead relatives from the rubble in Mosul.
