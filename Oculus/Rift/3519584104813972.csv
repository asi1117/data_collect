Being a fan of the movie Volcano, this game is a must for me.  Having hot lava approach you while trying to figure out of to escape the mine gets my heart racing.  Having a good PC to run the game will make your experience better.","Mar 5, 2021 at 1:25 PM",5, 11,
2022-05-28 20:15:02.627080,rickm4555,Intense Challenging Action,It took me awhile to get through the game and found it to be very entertaining with a great mix of different creative levels.  A good mix of interaction and skill needed to complete.  Needed to rely on the instructions and found a number of areas which were suprisingly scary.  Very creative design. Really well Done!,"Mar 21, 2021 at 6:32 AM",5, 3,

My Quick Thoughts:
A simplistic escape the room style game where you have to solve the puzzles before being swallowed by LAVA.
Nice concept with simple puzzles and some annoying mechanics and clip detection.","Mar 12, 2021 at 7:52 AM",3, 1,"Hi ParadiseDecay,  Thank you for the review,  I updated the game yesterday after watching the video and fixed the basketball hoop that was causing some challenges with the ball bouncing out. The video provided me with helpful insight. I hope you had the chance to play past the 4th chamber."
