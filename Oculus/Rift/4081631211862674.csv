If you're looking to lie on your back amidst some grass with light, relaxing music, then look no further.  You can breathe in, let stress dissolve, and walk about this gorgeous and meticulously crafted landscape.  

Tip:  Click the left thumbstick for smooth motion (much more immersive, in my opinion) and just enjoy this one.

Action heroes, you might want to skip.  You'd probably call this a walking simulator.  But for those looking for an escape, it's 30-60 mins of R&R just when you need it most.

Well done and please keep your developments coming.  They hit a much needed niche that doesn't get enough footfall in my humble opinion.","Apr 23, 2021 at 3:48 AM",4, 18,

Bonus for the hidden camera, you can save the photos your computer. That is really cool. I think this is worth 8-10 euros at least. Would happily pay the 4 euros again. Recommended! Also check out the developer's other simulators (on Steam though).","Apr 24, 2021 at 9:45 PM",5, 5,
