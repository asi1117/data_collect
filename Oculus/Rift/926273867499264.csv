2022-05-28 17:39:22.487516,HarbingerThrace,AMAZING!,"Beautiful story and animation.  It was really touching and would LOVE to see more of these in VR.  VR is not only the best way of playing games, but also of telling stories like these.  My only issue was the animation would hiccup very subtly every so often.  Maybe it was my antivirus, but I have a good pc setup and can play almost anything without issues.  Just wanted to point it out in case there is something that needs fixing.","Jun 17, 2020 at 3:34 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:39:22.502476,AlexAudio,Brilliant!!,"This completely ruined traditional tv for me. There are many ways to tell a story.  Books, movies, live plays, etc. This is the BEST way to tell a story. Everything else suddenly feels outdated. Completely immersed , beautiful  art , beautiful story. Not a word is spoken the entire story, yet it still felt very powerful. A lot of heart and dedication went into this. It proves that the future of story telling is going to be incredible. Great job !!! Thanks for the experience !!","Feb 22, 2020 at 10:54 AM",5, 3,

I won't go into the story of this gem as others have already mentioned it but if you are looking for a ""hair standing up on you arms and neck"" emotion reaction then watch this,  I played through a few times and loved it.

2022-05-28 17:39:28.826561,Praxeos,Brilliant!,"The layout of the ""stage"" for this little play was pure genius. The viewer is standing in the middle of the set, watching the puppet-like characters act out each scene. Most of the action unfolds right in front, but there's just enough going on around you to make the whole thing feel very immersive. This is a wonderful and artistic use of a new medium.","Oct 15, 2018 at 5:12 AM",5, 3,

2022-05-28 17:40:03.555673,jmalmsten,Finally a VR-short that works!,For the life of me I will never really understand why everyone keeps praising that Henry short. It was unimaginative and had that dreaded stageplay like feeling of a locked down viewport and everything happening somewhere else. Not so with Allumette. Not so at all. Having the story in miniatures floating in the air was nothing short of a stroke of genius! While the stuttering stop-motion-like movements were unexpected I grew to like it quickly. And to be encouraged as a viewer to walk up to the story and inspect the scenery as the narrative unfolds was stroke nr 2. And the best part for me was when I knew the girl was in the airship and I tried putting my head inside it through the wall and found that they had gone all out and animated the action inside the airship as well I felt rewarded for my curiosity again.
