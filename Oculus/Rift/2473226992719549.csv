First of all, i have to say that i was looking for games for my childs, (they are 8 and 5). It is really hard to find good games instead of short experiences. And let me tell you, it was a blast ! It only takes 2 second to figure what you have to do in each stage, and this is what sometimes lack in VR games. And what i should not expect happenned : my wife liked the game very much (even if she felt some motion sikness in vehicule stages).
The game is colorful, controls are simple but on point (move and jump), and you always want to try the next level. 
As a player, my games are Walkind Dead, Half Life Alyx, Boneworks, and all that kind of stuff, but i took some good time in this game too !
@dev : don't let it die, as i've tried more than 100 VR games since 4 years, and this one is what this industry lack the most, some simple but polished and fun games. You put the headset, you play and enjoy. My family thanks you a lot.
Keep up the good work !","Mar 27, 2020 at 2:52 AM",4, 4,

This was a rather fun game! Shooting down the rapids, jumping, gliding through the air and double jumping, wasps, thorny brambles, and rivers, but the funniest (and hardest) was driving the car. Sadly, there was only about 27 levels so it was over in about a half hour, but it was still fun and looked great in VR. I saw where there's a new module coming soon, can't wait for that! Probably will play it again at some point; fun and cute little platformer!!! Can't beat it for the price!","Jan 17, 2020 at 8:38 AM",4, 1,
