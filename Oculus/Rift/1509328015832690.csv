There is just not much to do and unlock yet. I would love new DJ tables, new locations, new gadgets, maybe different looking crowd between the places and so on. 

And what I REALLY miss is a height adjustment setting. My son wanted to mix some tunes and wasnt really able to since he didnt reach the dj table which left him pretty disappointed.","Sep 8, 2019 at 7:59 PM",3, 3,

Disco Distruction definitely falls into that category. I think the best way to describe the concept is guitar hero - but you're a DJ! :)

And the potential for fun and challenge is pretty high, too, I think.

And it is fun and I think it is one for anyone to play and have a try.  A family number, I spose.  You can also add your own music - which is good.
It would be fun to somehow allow people to join - and then it would have  social element to it: DJ'ing for your mates.

Just need a beer hat that can fit over the Rift and then everything would be perfect!  Hah.","Jun 3, 2019 at 12:52 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 19:55:54.435086,JDakotaPowell,Interesting and different concept,"Played quite a few VR games, but Disco Destruction differs from the usual suspects - eg, shooters and adventure-puzzle games - in that the user steps into the role of a DJ. The goal is to keep the crowd pulsing to the music. The happier the crowd, the more money you make for the disco. Enjoyed jumping into a mixing music tutorial and wouldn't mind going through a set of virtual lessons on how the pros do it... The challenge of trying to affect a crowd's mood via music was fun and intriguing. When they're not pleased, they let you know with comments and even throwing fruit... which (from a feedback POV) was terrific! In this piece, you are the maestro, center stage. That said, I would've liked a bigger crowd (a flock) to sway, even a few low-poly peeps drinking at the bar, so that the room is always buzzing on some level. Looking forward to seeing how this piece evolves!","Jan 3, 2019 at 7:12 PM",4, 5,
