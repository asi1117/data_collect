Some ""camera"" cuts/transitions could be better and the overall artwork isn't as strong as it could be -- it relies heavily on black outlining of the characters and their features. If you're a comics fan then you'll see this as a good indy title, but it's definitely worth experiencing.","Sep 3, 2018 at 10:08 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 18:28:50.825791,GreenSquid772,,"There is about 30 minutes of story here, split into three chapters. For $5 I found this experience enjoyable enough, but not amazing. The characters are animated pretty well and there are a couple of neat moments in the fight scenes, but the environments are quite plain. I also couldn’t find any graphics options – this seems to have been ported over from console with few changes for PC. The story is just okay. It is clearly aimed at a younger audience (and I do think kids would enjoy this experience), but that doesn’t mean you can’t tell an interesting story for older viewers too! Look at ‘Avatar: The Last Airbender’ if you need proof of this. The third episode ends with a ‘To Be Continued’ screen, so it seems the creators are planning to continue the story at some point in the future. I will be interested to see where they take things.","Apr 4, 2018 at 6:41 PM",3, 14,
