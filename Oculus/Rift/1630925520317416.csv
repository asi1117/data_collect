Not even in the simplest things like the grip or zoom works: I do the grip and / or zoom but the game does not realize it and keeps asking me to do it. I have only been able to complete tutorial 1, so I have not been able to enjoy the game. I wait a few days for an answer or I will request a refund.

Has any developer even tried it?","Apr 29, 2018 at 6:31 AM",1, 15,
