2022-05-28 15:44:51.138855,john.c.linstrum,Fun Game,Took me about an hour to finish. If you have no idea what to do next you can push the elevator call button and get a slight hint. Nice way to kill an hour if you're looking for a low stress puzzle game.,"Jul 5, 2019 at 2:11 PM",4, 11,

2022-05-28 15:44:54.303391,taquitobuddy,Not much to offer,My wife and I didn't really enjoy this one at all.  Not much gameplay here and not a great VR implementation at all.  Much better VR puzzle games are available.,"Jan 2, 2019 at 6:29 AM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 15:44:54.318351,Spalman_yt,So far so great,"I've really enjoyed this game, but when I used the magnet gun to attract the meat to me, the game seemed to glitch. The magnet just disappeared and I couldn't interact with anything anymore (I couldn't even press buttons, they didn't light up). This game has a great and cute sense of humor and looks overall pretty well done. I would recommend it for everyone who likes games that make you giggle.","Nov 12, 2018 at 5:22 AM",4, 6,
2022-05-28 15:44:54.333311,BludiVR,Kind of short tbh,"The game was pretty entertaining and I enjoyed playing it, but like any game, it has an end. It took me 39 minutes to beat the game, and it honestly just felt short. I mean it's a great game, and you guys must have spent a lot of time making it, but ,aybe there should be some easter eggs or some side missions that you can find to make the game last a little longer.","Dec 31, 2018 at 4:50 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 15:44:57.444988,Abe.Normal.718,Quirky and Fun Puzzle Game,"If you see this game on sale then I would definitely reccomend buying it.  Took about an hour to beat, but that's about what I expected.   You spend the entire game in an elevator so this is one of the few games in VR that I've been able to sit in a chair and relax while playing.","Jul 31, 2018 at 5:16 PM",4, 1,
2022-05-28 15:44:57.460945,Anomalous2141,Quirky if Brief Fun,"Play VR long enough and your opinion on how long a game should be will start to shift.  Truth be told, just about every brilliant experience developed for VR is too brief.  And this one is brilliant.  Fun, challenging puzzles make good use of the VR environment where rules are strange but intuitive.  My first playthrough took 47 minutes, but now that I know how to beat it I can probably blow through it in ten.  Sure, there are gonna be Easter eggs to find, but replayability isn't too great.  Try to hold out for $10 or less and I think you'll be satisfied with this delightful standing puzzler.","Jun 18, 2018 at 8:35 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 15:44:57.474909,SxSnipeR,Fun but too short,The levels are enjoyable but it's way too easy and super short. Finished in about 25 minutes.,"Jan 9, 2018 at 3:09 AM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 15:44:57.489868,Renemouse,REally fun game,"Very fun game, very cute. No movement at all (not even teleporting), no jumpscares, can be played seated - perfect to show family or people who don't like the more intense games.","Dec 25, 2017 at 1:52 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 15:44:57.503831,Tempa7,Fun Puzzles but VERY SHORT,"Go this on a sale for 3€
For that price 4 Stars.

But if you get it for 6€
it is to short for that money. 3 Stars","Dec 16, 2017 at 1:05 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 15:45:00.606532,Enigmaz42,Great little game,This was a really fun way to kill a couple of  hours. I think I got it for $5. My sister and I both had a great time playing it. Easily worth the money.,"Dec 1, 2017 at 2:15 PM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:45:00.621492,FastLawyer,Charming puzzle game and world,"There's definitely a lot of creativity in the  imagining of this puzzle world.  You're basically in an elevator and going up and down floors to solve puzzles.  The puzzles are the kind where you do have to use your imagination.  All of them make sense when you solve them, but some don't make too much sense before you find the solution.  I have to admit that I had to use hints to get past two of them.  You really don't need touch controllers to get through this game and it's probably better with the remote as it can be a seated experience.  In the end, I had some fun but also some frustration.  And I really don't see myself playing this game again.  Finished in one hour, but I got stuck on two puzzles and this game could probably be finished in 15 minutes.","Sep 2, 2017 at 10:17 AM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 15:45:00.637449,mambazo,Great fun but short,"Despite the warning you get when you go to buy it, which says you need 7 feet by 5 feet to play, you don't need any space at all. This is front facing. So ignore the warning and get this game :)","Sep 1, 2017 at 7:36 AM",4, 5,

2022-05-28 15:45:00.666372,xAstroBoy,Last Update completely broke the game,Is just stuck in a grey room for me.,"Sep 9, 2017 at 5:59 AM",1, 1,This is fixed in update 2.0.6. Sorry about that!
2022-05-28 15:45:03.768076,Wrek86,Very fun little game,"One of the few games worth the money. It can be a bit juvenile, but it's a fun puzzle game. The end has a timer which showed my time was 39 minutes which is pretty good for a game that actually tried to be good and succeeded. The game is played without a moving the camera, but just a ""stand in place and look around"" style, so good news for those of you that get VR sickness.","Dec 10, 2016 at 12:03 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 15:45:03.783037,KevinLongtime,Better puzzle game than I expected!,Such a great puzzle game. The game is based around getting items from each floor and figuring out how to use them to solve the puzzles on various different floors. Had a lot of fun with this one. Total play time was about 37 minutes for me.,"Nov 26, 2016 at 4:54 AM",5, 4,
