The graphics are beautiful and it runs relatively smoothly. The combat is where there seems to be a lot of contention but for me, I find it satisfying and entertaining but I can understand the sentiments of those who feel the combat is a little shallow but I figure that only seems so because of the ""Story Mode"" difficulty setting.  I suspect the higher difficulty will bring much greater challenge as I can see the potential in the parry system and magic attacks. 

It reminds me of playing Star Wars Fallen Order on Story Mode. It can make you feel the game is easy and combat, shallow but that is remedied by higher difficulties and for me,  most importantly, the player's ability to Role-play.  After watching A Wolf in VR on YouTube, I realized you just have to have fun and get into the role. I know some people think it's silly to Role-play but those people are playing videogames,  which is nothing BUT Role-play. 

I'm enjoying the game. Thanks for the fun.",Nov 23 at 7:01 AM,5, 23,

It 'looks' nice but the weapon selection, spell casting and wielding is akward, the NPC's dont even look at you when they are talking, very bland and lifeless.

Good attempt",Nov 21 at 5:31 AM,3, 23,"Hi! Thank you for leaving a review! A patch has been submitted that fixes certain issues mentioned by the community, and we're working on a second one.

2022-05-28 20:02:59.001078,Bintryin,I LOVE THIS GAME  2 patches and WOW !!!!,"A Lot of work has gone into the lovely sceans and  lighting in this game . Sure some textures could be better and some of the fighting could be better but just love the scenery its great!  keeps me immersed in this for hours just exploring. Well done . Loved the wizards as well one of my favourite games along with this now. I'm sure the devs will tweek it here and there. We'll done fantastic game. Ps would love some smoke after you kill the floating ghosts instead of dots. This would add alot more atmosphere to the game!!!
Edit just came across the bug that wants you to repeat . But can't. So I would need to restart the game all over dropping to 1 star untill this is fixed. What a shame not tested properly. Update my ratings after the new patch sofar so good looking much better. Keep it up going 4 stars now it looks so good. You have my attention now!!! After the update I gave 4 stars now I'm going 5 stars this is up there with one of the best vr games I have ever played. This is a game I can't wait to get back into. WOW WOW. Five stars now.",Dec 10 at 2:04 PM,5, 5,
2022-05-28 20:02:59.016038,RickRun,A Good Start,"Overall, the game is not bad. It is clearly a low-budget product, but it defends itself well thanks to colorful graphics and on average of a good level, even if some very low resolution textures, I would have avoided putting them so close to the player's action areas.
The game perhaps lacks a little too much monotony, there are no puzzles other than transporting an object from one place to another and the enemies are completely devoid of artificial intelligence. They reach out to you and attack you, without reacting in the slightest to your actions.
The high number of enemies on the screen without serious slowdowns is valuable, but at the same time it would have been better to put fewer but more intelligent ones, this would have favored the inclusion of more details in the background and a greater sense of challenge.
Perhaps most disappointing is the complete absence of physics and collisions. Of course this decreases the calculations of the system and also lowers the risk of bugs in the interaction phase, but penetrating into any object or obstacle is very frustrating and the fights lose solidity.
To put it mildly, it's a flat game with attractive graphics, especially in recent years where the quality of VR games has dropped enormously. I hope that the developers earn enough to be able to continue working on new projects in VR by implementing new parameters capable of creating more immersive experiences.",Nov 30 at 5:51 AM,3, 9,
2022-05-28 20:02:59.030998,Supplefruit,Terrible game,The combat feels like playing an original wii game. The controls and moments are so poorly thought out that you'll spend more time working to draw weapons or cast a spell as opposed to actually playing the game. Real disappointed in this game and the fact that it can even be on the oculus store.,Nov 20 at 1:06 AM,1, 7,"Hey there! Thank you for leaving a review and we're sorry you are having a bad time with our game. With the help of the community, we're working on a couple of patches that will make the game much better. We hope that after those patches are live you will give Tempestfall another shot  :) Cheers!"
2022-05-28 20:03:02.141302,Buddyweiser,Bugs make you restart mid game. :(,"Really sux to restart because the game is broken. Any fixes coming? I can’t get out of hero’s hall now and the game sux now :(

I changed my review because I am having fun with the game after starting it over from the very beginning twice now. I appreciate bigger titles like this coming to VR.  Please fix that problem and I'll give it 5 stars.",Nov 21 at 12:44 AM,4, 5,"Hey there! Thank you for leaving a review and yes, there are patches incoming!

2022-05-28 20:03:02.156262,paetrix,Not bad,"I like this game. BUT why the ennemis are sometimes invicible? When i try to hurt them with my sword or other arms, sometimes they re can t be touched??!
