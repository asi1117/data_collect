2022-05-28 19:39:10.724137,intrepidOlivia,The game appears broken,The idea for this game seems really cool. But it's so buggy as to be unplayable. The concepts listed within the crystals don't change no matter how many times you click on them. :( :( Can't progress past the first Training session.,"Sep 26, 2019 at 10:20 AM",1, 0,
2022-05-28 19:39:10.739097,ADPGrommit,Needs a reason to be VR,"I'll start off by saying I am glad this is not one of the first games I tried in VR.  Anyone who has read my review for Lost Echo will understand why that is important.
I have always been a fan of puzzle logic and word games and have learned to appreciate them even more  in my later years because... well, I've outgrown the urge to blow everyone to pieces. 
So this is basically a logic/word game that tasks you with toggling nodes of a network so that each node matches the adjacent node conceptually.  Imagine an AI judged version of Apples to Apples  on a nodal network where every node has to get a thumbs up to complete the stage.  If I lost you with that card game reference:  Pick words that make sense with words next to them, rinse, repeat.  This is the part where you ask ""who is that going to appeal to?""  I'd say anyone who likes to play Trivial Persuit and/or Sudoku style games would appreciate the concept because it has elements of both.  I've only played it through a couple stages so I can't speak to the difficulty or complexity of the associations the game expects you to make.  However I found some of the ones I saw interesting and will probably play again  on higher difficulties to see what else it has to offer.  So far I've enjoyed what I've played and would recommend it to anyone who likes games in the genre.
So now we come to the part where I explain why I only gave 2 stars with such limited play time.  The answer is simple: Why did I need a VR headset to play this game?
There wasn't a moment in the game where I felt VR mattered.  If I put headphones on and played this game on a tablet I don't think it would be any less immersive.  There was no connection to the virtual space via Touch controllers or headset movement.  To be clear:  I'm not saying that makes it a bad game.  I'm just saying it's not a game ready to offer anything in VR.
VR doesn't make everything better.  You can play checkers in VR with arrow keys and the spacebar but why would you?","Jul 19, 2018 at 9:36 AM",2, 1,"Good, now try playing without looking at/reading the words. Totally doable - often the only way to win in Tricky Mode - but not possible without VR."
2022-05-28 19:39:10.755054,razialo,"Mindblowing, Relaxing, Stunning!","This is one of the uniqe kind! The music as well as the visual appeal are just beyond your standart VR experience. Is is educational, relaxing, stunning and mindblowing. How can something be such a mixture of different attributes? Play it yourself, if's absolutly worth it! Try it out!","Jun 26, 2018 at 5:55 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:39:10.770014,Andrew_Deegan,Super graphics concept and environments,"Excellent demonstration of mind bending graphics in VR. 
Fun word concept matching game. 
The music is also pretty chilled!","Jun 29, 2018 at 10:55 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:39:10.783977,aben311,A journey to the furure,"This experience will transport your mind to a futuristic environment that youwill not expected, it's a fantastic project to explore something different in VR.

Great work!","Jun 28, 2018 at 2:56 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:39:13.919695,simonindelicate,Rewards curiosity - cool and weird,"Was lucky to get an early look at this and delighted to see it go live on the store. This is a weird, high concept VR experience with a lovely, techno-spiritual aesthetic and thoughtful gameplay that reveals itself to the player slowly via a process of intuitive elimination. There's a pleasing lack of handholding. I love it.","Apr 14, 2018 at 1:53 AM",5, 4,Thanks so much. Hearing reactions like this really gives us the best incentive to keep building.
2022-05-28 19:39:13.934656,shadowsora211,Great art style and music,"Love the visuals, and the concept of different song loops mixing together as you solve the puzzles. It's quite a relaxing experience.
My only small issue was that I felt a bit motion sick at first. But after playing with the VR assist mode on, and seated rather than standing, I didn't feel sick at all.","Apr 24, 2018 at 5:20 AM",5, 3,"Thanks for the good words! We're glad the VR Assist mode helped you enjoy the free-floato-moting experience of GNOSIS! Yeah seated is the recommended way to play, though an occasional standing session can be even more immersive."
2022-05-28 19:39:13.950612,Valver,Wanted to like it - but couldnt progress,"Looks like a word association type puzzle - selecting nodes in a very Tron-esque VR world.  But I got stuck at the ""select oscillating from the central node"" step during the tutorial.  None of the nodes, central or otherwise, displayed the word Oscillating.  Got frsutrated after 5 minutes of trying to complete that step.  Gave up.","Apr 12, 2018 at 5:21 AM",2, 2,"Thank you for letting us know about the problem with Training Mode and describing it in detail, we're really very sorry that your first contact with the game wasn't a good experience and your expectations weren't met. 

We fixed the issue in Version 1.4 update which is now available, enormous thanks to players who provided feedback necessary to replicate the issue and remedy it. We made a few smaller design adjustments which should make things clearer for first-time players."
2022-05-28 19:39:13.965572,Aquavemo,Interesting idea and visuals,but the tutorial is soo slow. I had to wait for the voice scripts to catch up to my progress for 3 minutes or so. (I already solved the puzzle while the tutorial was still explaining the first steps to me) That was very irritating.,"Apr 15, 2018 at 11:10 PM",5, 3,"Thank you for your feedback, patience and a vote of confidence! We will rework that in later patch by adding the option to skip - or redesign the tutorial altogether. The issue here was that it is theoretically possible someone will solve the tutorial puzzle by brute-force while still not understanding what is the objective. We are aware of the shortcomings of the Tutorial and something more to the point is not-too-distant on the roadmap. Glad you enjoyed the visuals!"
2022-05-28 19:39:13.980532,richardschut,Interesting Concept,"I like the approach of being in a kind of mindspace. Getting into the game requires some time, but then it's fun.

Promising concept, curious how this will develop further.

Keep on innovating :)","Apr 13, 2018 at 1:45 AM",4, 5,"Thanks for playing, glad you like the concept. We are adding a lot of UX polish for the next patch so stay tuned!"
2022-05-28 19:39:17.079863,mardarm,Interesting Game / Concept,"Have played this a few times and it keeps drawing me back as it different to all the other things in my library.
I think this is just the beginning and will develop further in the future.","Apr 14, 2018 at 10:38 AM",5, 5,"Thanks for that.. Very happy you find Gnosis worth repeat visiting!
And yes, on immediate roadmap we have some haptic feedback goodness and removing the Gamepad emulation which seems to cause problems for the players (unplug secondary joystick if you run into the issue). 
With that in place, next step is proper Touch support which requires a rethink of the design but we're very excited about what it could do for the Lexicon Mode!"
2022-05-28 19:39:17.094823,gl1tchy,,"Fantastic aesthetic, music, and concept... this comes pretty close to my image of cyberspace in Gibson's Neuromancer!","Apr 20, 2018 at 4:08 AM",5, 2,"We're so honored to hear this! And thank you for bringing up the music, which was the initial impulse from which everything else followed. BTW, the 16-track LP has just been mastered at Tiredbeat - we'll have an announcement about it soon... :)"
