2022-05-28 20:10:05.507138,jimythedrummer,Who has been reviewing this game!?!,"First of all, before anyone says anything, I know the game is free and I cant expect a lot from a free game. That being said these are my honest thoughts and maybe it will help.

There is currently only one activity that you can do. The duel. While trying to load the gun, I spent a good 3 minutes attempting to pick up a ball in order to load it into the musket. My in game hand would litterally grab at the balls with no persision and would scatter them all around. When I would single one out, the same thing would happen, and the ball would roll off the table. It took quite a while to even load it. Which killed immersion as well as enjoyment. 

There are no options for adjusting locomotion or turning style. So for someone who has been playing vr for a while and is only used to smoothe locomotion and smoothe turning, this was a bit jaring and made me want to stop. 

Graphics are decent for sure, just not able to enjoy them as I can not get past the  arcaic turning and moving settings.",Jul 29 at 6:54 AM,2, 8,
