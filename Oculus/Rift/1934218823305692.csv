2022-05-28 21:01:12.928440,klyonline,Great title without subtitles,"The ambient is great, interesting puzzles and narrative game, but the price is too expensive for a game without english or spanish subtitles.

Update: English subtitles have been added later, I will change to 5 stars when the spanish subtitles are added and I can replay it and understand better some things in the story.

I had bugs with missing objects, once the german note dissapeard and I had to go yo Youtube to decipher it.

At finish, it's an amazing game, it is the Alyx of Escape Room games.

I can't wait the second part and I'll buy it inmediatly (if it is released with subtitles, of course :P)",Mar 24 at 8:57 PM,4, 11,"Thank you for your lovely review. As you've noted, English subtitles are now available. We are working on Spanish subtitles and these will be ready in the next few weeks. Thanks for your patience and glad you enjoyed the game."
2022-05-28 21:01:12.943400,J_Shepz,"A new ""must have"" experience!","I don't say this lightly but this game is one of my new favourite VR games ever. The visuals are stunning and the interactions are amazing, no more weird floaty hands just passing right through objects, it all feels grounded and ""real"" allowing even better presence in the game, even if there's time travel & a talking Watch involved, ha! The developers have put in so much love & care with this game, having really taken note of previous popular VR titles and what works well for this medium to weave all the greatest bits together to create a new must have experience for VR. I cannot wait to see more!",Jan 29 at 5:41 AM,5, 74,
2022-05-28 21:01:12.957362,funnywheeno,prettty good,"To set the record straight: This game does not reach the impossibly high bar Half Life: Alyx has set. But they borrowed a number of concepts from Valve. The graphics are great, but you still feel like you're in a video game environment, while Alyx feels like movie sets. The wrist watch companion talks too much, gives too many hints away, tries to be too funny too often... The character animation is not bad, but characters snap between poses when they finish an animation and start their idle cycle again and they repeat themselves too much... The environment design is great but is unpolished in many places when looking out the window... Any way you slice it: it's no match for Alyx. I understand that not every studio has that kind of budget to throw at a game but Alyx has shown that treating a VR game like a film production makes the difference between a good and an awesome VR experience.

That being said, the game is still worth buying. The storyline is compelling, it runs on my Rift on highest settins without problems and the puzzles are enjoyable albeit too easy with that wrist watch giving everything away.",Apr 29 at 4:32 AM,4, 0,
2022-05-28 21:01:12.972322,skateninja,fun but bug filled,"I've enjoyed this game,  its got some great touches .  BUT the crashes and bugs are frustrating.  Disappointing , especially when completing a puzzle it doesnt recognise the finish so have to redo a chapter.   The turbine chapter is terrible for this.  Looking at the other similar comments I'm hoping some patches will be available.  The bugs dont do the game justice.",Apr 20 at 11:33 PM,3, 0,
2022-05-28 21:01:12.987282,keeperofkeys,Excellent! WOW,"Excellent work!  I was waiting for this game to release and what an excellent experience!  Gameplay, Graphics, Puzzles, are AMAZING! Here is my setup- using an HP gaming PC (AMD Ryzen 2700 8 core processor with a Radeon RX 580x video card.) My Headset is an Oculus Quest with original Link Cable. Get the original Link cable ... other cables are testy and sometimes disconnect. Also, I decided to purchase from MetaQuest. (originally Oculus store). I wasnt dissappointed!  It plays great with no issues this far!
Amazing!  Game runs smooth as can be and also has locomotion movement if you want to immerse yourself.  Turning around with joystickis smooth as well! The developers are to be commended!  This is a MASTERPIECE!  Compared to Half Life Alyx...just as good if not better! So far, no tearing at all! Games like this set the bar HIGH for VR.  Dont hestitate to buy! Thank you to the Developers and to MetaQuest for a wonderful experience.",Jan 30 at 8:11 PM,5, 31,
2022-05-28 21:01:16.093973,e-paris,Amazing but needs subtitles,"That's what virtual reality was made for. It's like a giant escape room in different places and time lines. The puzzles and items interactions are amazing. I have never seen those mechanics before.

The negative point is that it's only in English and there are not even subtitles. I'm Spanish and some clues escape from my listening skills. I only hope this comes added in next updates.

I also found some bugs at early game which made me need to start the game again from the beginning.",Feb 21 at 5:23 AM,4, 10,Thank you for the awesome review. English subtitles are now available.

2022-05-28 21:01:16.108933,christian.holder.3,Game to beat for 2022,"By far the best game out in past year. Very nice puzzles. When you can clean a picture with a spray bottle and dishes scrubber you know it's a thinking man's game. Well worth the extra wait.
And I have to mention the optimization. After the first time I started I am in game within one minute. Best load times so far. Please share your secret with other VR companies.",Jan 31 at 7:06 AM,5, 24,
2022-05-28 21:01:16.122896,xxSILVxx,Buy it,We haven’t had a quality game like this since pre quest days. Its like returning to the days of stormland and Asgard wrath only to be created by an indie team which fills me with so much hope that other indie teams can follow in their footsteps. Please buy this game it is astounding. The more people who buy it the more chance we will get other games of its caliber.,Jan 30 at 7:45 PM,5, 19,
2022-05-28 21:01:16.140848,firkinfedup,Not ready for prime time,"I'm going to be brutually honest, I don't know why this has such high reviews, pretty sure they weren't playing the same game I was.  I've tried playing this several times now and had to give up right near the beginning..

Everything looked great to start with, was very hopeful that this game was going to be next level.  First oddity is that you can open doors from a distance, via some disembodied hand, fair enough, I don't understand it, but I guess it's not the end of the world.

The tutorial part is extremely short and mainly introducing you to motion then you're in the game.  You don't start with any storage capabilities and holding a walky talky, do you need this? No idea... Continuing onto the boat it's evident that they didn't expect anyone over 6 foot to play this game, as the tarp cuts my head off and causes me to need to stoop at the back of the boat, most uncomfortable. Then the real issues start...

The croc bit.... if you can actually get the flares to not pass straight through the explosive barrels then it's extremely easy, but if you need to reload the flare gun, whilst simultaneously fighing off the crocs then you will get extremely frustrated with the janky mechanics.  Getting past this bit, is interesting..  I was asked to leave the boat, failed, as the weird jumping mechanism that's offered to you when using locomotion movement rather than teleporting, glitched out for me, and I ended up stuck on the boat when she drove off, she then disappeared, so I'm standing on the boat on my own, until the screen when white, then restarted that bit... great! except no, it started me in the water, glitching out.

You shouldn't have to try hard to enjoy something, it's either fun or it isn't and I can't do it... just can't try that again as it's crazy annoying.",Feb 2 at 3:02 AM,1, 10,"Hey there - thanks for your feedback and apologies you encountered a couple of issues. 

We've been working hard to fix any of the more common issues and have uploaded 2 new patches since your last play. It solves the 'stuck on the boat' issue and you should now be able to adjust the height or play seated - hopefully this solves the height issues you were experiencing. 

The lack of inventory is a purposeful design, once you get into the apartment (past the boat) you'll have the opportunity to carry things with you. 

If you do feel it's worth another try hopefully it's more enjoyable the second time around. And please get in touch if you experience any other issues or have further feedback. Discord is best https://discord.gg/zcNAFmyy but you can also email us at support@wanderervr.com.

2022-05-28 21:01:16.154811,Jennifer.Killian,Love Game-but can't play anymore,I downloaded the game and played for 5 hours the first night. I loved it. The next day update 1.08 was required to play. I have been trying for two days to get the update to load and it is stuck at optimizing download 2 of 2 at 5% for days now. I don't know what to do and can't play anymore.,Mar 18 at 11:31 AM,3, 0,
2022-05-28 21:01:19.256514,Terboman,Buggy mess,"I was incredibly excited for this game since the release.  I was excited to come home and play it, but I’ll certainly be returning it. This game is a buggy unfinished mess.  

I had to restart the game twice to get off of the boat in the beginning. I got stuck in the boat twice and there was nothing I could do but restart.  Completely game breaking.

There are white lines in all the walls, like seeing through walls. 

There’s no height setting or seated mode which makes is unplayable in a seated position. 

The gripping system and hold system is clumsy, makes it hard to interact with anything.  Especially that flare gun, if that’s what the rest of the game will be like than no thank you.  

Graphics and texture I can get over, surely spoiled from some other games, like alyx, so that’s not a concern, but on highest graphical setting I don’t understand what the high praise is. Honestly I don’t know where the high praise for this game is at all. I’m sure getting into the meat of the game is an enjoyable experience, but so far everything I’ve seen has been a deal breaker. For 40 dollars I’ll be returning it before I break two hours.",Feb 2 at 12:29 PM,1, 6,"Hey there - we're really sorry to hear you encountered some issues and appreciate your feedback. We've been working hard to fix as many issues as we can and there have been two new patches since you played. 

In particular - you shouldn't get stuck on the boat anymore and seated play is now fully supported (it just narrowly missed our launch). 

Understand you've returned the game but if you do feel it's worth another try hopefully it's more enjoyable the second time around.

2022-05-28 21:01:19.271475,ZVB73,"Perfectly fine, not as good as it looks","Everything in this game is fine. But only fine. Nothing has been exceptional, so I'd give this an ""average"" rating. I would recommend on sale, but temper your expectations",Apr 7 at 11:24 AM,3, 0,
2022-05-28 21:01:19.286435,mattman6886,AMAZING,"An excellent VR “escape room” style puzzle adventure game with exceptional production values. If you’re a fan of VR games like Red Matter, The Room VR, Maskmaker, etc. you can’t go wrong with this one! It has mechanics and puzzle elements that are reminiscent of those games but puts in an original AAA package with a compelling story and fantastic visuals and overall presentation.

I think I’ve encountered a glitch though: 

In the Tesla area where you find that videotape, instead of getting the “Amelia” one I got a second copy of the “for Asher” message from your grandpa video. Just a heads up in case it can be fixed and I hope I’m not missing any other story elements.",Feb 3 at 1:44 AM,5, 6,"Hi there - thanks for the great review and pleased to hear you enjoyed the game.

2022-05-28 21:01:19.301395,Franco_Polo,A fantastic if a bit unpolished game,"The most fun I've had in VR since HL: Alyx and Boneworks!

Good story, great puzzles that are varied and don't repeat themselves too much, and nice graphics (plus the game runs surpisingly well even on a GTX 1060 with Quest 2 via Air Link). The story feels like it ends just as it was picking up steam, but at 9 hours for my playthrough, I'm satisfied. Hope this game gets the recognition it deserves and we get a sequel or two!

Now it isn't super polished and I've encountered a couple of bugs, but none were gamebreaking. Seems like the devs have already fixed issues with some of the items entirely disapearing, softlocking players until they reload a previous chapter. I did have some items go missing when [SPOILER] the apartment changed, but I was able to go back and find them in their time streams.

I would deduct half a star for some of the bugs and jank to make it 4.5 stars, but no half stars here so I'm happy enough to round to 5 stars.",Mar 8 at 5:07 AM,5, 0,

2022-05-28 21:01:22.435013,BravoBrave,What a garbage glitched game,"First game breaking glitch at 1906 with the 4 light bulbs. I moved all 4 bulbs from the box over to the table inserting 3 of them to solve the puzzle. Restored power to the Tower and was asked by Tesla to carry the light bulb outside only for the bulb to fling out of my hand out of the building glitching over in the snow. There's no way to retrieve the bulb and the bulb won't reappear back in the box making the mission unsolvable. I guess I would have to go way back and start the chapter again, but I have a problem with that and that is what if the game glitches again?! Now this so called latest 1.07 update/patch didn't fix nothing, only making matters worst, so I went back on a checkpoint and lost my current progress and it's like I didn't accomplish nothing resetting pretty much everything including the nice apartment back to the ruined apartment. 
My first rating was a 4, changed to a 3 because of the gitched bulb now this garbage bugged update. Yeah, I'm done with this game. I wish I could get my money back.",Feb 23 at 12:35 AM,1, 2,
2022-05-28 21:01:22.450970,WreckitRelfe,Amazing Puzzler maybe game of the year,"Post apocalyptic meets quantum leap meets Indiana Jones meets Apollo 13 meets the Room VR.  This game is a must have and will definitely be on my favorite VR games of the year if not of all time.  

Full disclosure I used the teleport mode for movement.  I’ve read some people have had issues with locomotion.  Also, there is no seated mode, so be warned. 

The beginning alligator part I didn’t care for and wondered if I had made a $40 mistake.  But getting through that intro made the rest of the game SO worth the money.  

The concept is super imaginative and the story is so addictive.  Every time I put it down I wanted to keep coming back.  Can’t wait for the sequel.",Feb 3 at 11:59 AM,5, 4,"Hi there - thanks for the great review and pleased to hear you enjoyed the game. Just to let you know that the latest updates now fully support seated play.

2022-05-28 21:01:25.637448,oscar.chamberssmith,A romp through space-time,"Well I have to say I bought this based on the reviews and I was not disappointed. This is a challenging puzzle game which involves transporting objects from different times in your time travelling watch.

The watch uses different artefacts to transport you back to different times. The over arching story feels detailed and filled with life.

The puzzles are challenging for sure, but an inbuilt hint feature in the watch itself means you never feel stuck for what to do. My only gripe here is that sometimes the hints are too quick to come and almost solve the puzzle for you. For the most part though, this feature is well balanced.

The environments are beautiful, the physics is generally good and the graphics match them. Little details like your hands changing as you inhabit the bodies of different historical characters bring it to life. 

I would say this is on a par with Half Life Alyx as showing us what VR games can and should be about. They have used the format of VR to it's best and the developers should be recognised for this beautiful piece of art they have produced.

Buy this game.",Feb 5 at 12:16 AM,5, 2,

The overall impression is that it feels unpolished with clunky mechanics and controls which can be frustrating during parts of the game.
Graphically it looks like something that could be run natively on Quest 2 and not a modern PCVR game.
Puzzles range from super easy to confusing and tedious.
Didn’t encounter any major bugs on my playthrough except for some glitches and one crash.",Feb 4 at 8:04 AM,3, 2,"Hi there - thanks for your feedback, if you have time we'd love to hear more about what you think could be improved so we can consider this either now or in the future.

2022-05-28 21:01:25.668365,kelemenlajos,A great game with great bugs,"A worthy game to be mentioned together with the Lone Echo series. The only issue is the disappearing objects. I had some missing objects before, but they were not important (only random stuff, nothing important for the storyline). But after missing an important object, I loaded back the last chapter and found all my main storyline objects are missing, and my other storylines are incomplete. Sorry, but this is 1 star...

If you don't run into bugs it's a 4-5 star game! )",Feb 14 at 1:57 AM,1, 1,Hi there - sorry you've experienced some issues!

2022-05-28 21:01:28.771066,michal-opole,Amazing!!,"What an adventure and story. Woah. Some moments were so intense I was laughing out loud hardly believing what's happening. Creative puzzles that make you so proud to you got them! Some glitches may occur but still nothing serious. Highly recommended. Beautiful experience.

Really mellow SPOILER to explain what the game is: you need a blue frog later in the game to get high, you remember that you went pass a blue frog at the beginning (it's blue frog it's hard to miss). So you go to the place you saw it, it's not there, but there's elevator shaft, flooded. So you take fishing rod and a hook, you try fishing, you get a boot. You think of a bait, realize that you saw a lot of roaches on the floor in the kitchen, get the roach on the hook, try again. You get the blue frog.

I wasnt expecting an amazing game, but it seemed i had found what i needed in a VR game. It has a pretty cool story, you travel back and fourth through time to alter events to try and fix the present (long story short). The game is filled with puzzles that are really satisfying to figure out. Using objects in clever ways to open paths forward, eg- taking a rubber dart gun to a mayan temple to complete a puzzle. Its so cleverly made and i recommend to ANY one to buy it. Congrats to the devs on the success of your game. Here is an unofficial trailer

Shame I thought the game was playable even with the bugs but I was wrong misssing items put back in the wattch just disappered.  Lossing key items of the game has killed it for me  . If developer wants to help may change my rating. But for I would stay away especially at the moment.",Feb 7 at 3:20 AM,4, 0,"Hey there - really appreciate the feedback, we've been working hard to fix as many issues as we can and glad to hear it's working much better for you.

So I was disappointed that the first thing you encounter is an action sequence involving Alligators.  I couldn't get past it after five tries.  Now I'm asking for a refund.,Feb 14 at 5:47 AM,2, 0,
