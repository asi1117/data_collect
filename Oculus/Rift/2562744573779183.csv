2022-05-28 20:46:22.142973,Arthurji,"Beautiful, trippy on-rails experience","TERMINUS is a very trippy, beautiful, on-rails experience. Mostly non-interactive. It irritated me that the humanoids are all male. Lack of hands & interactivity made it more passive than I'd like. I think it's misleading to describe it as ""choose your own adventure."" Quite enjoyed it overall and would recommend it","Jan 16, 2021 at 4:06 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:46:22.157932,Daft-Krunk,Truly a unique VR experience,"After experiencing Terminus, I was immediately so disappointed in the fact that nothing else exists that is super similar. It really does quite an amazing job at just really creating an out of this world experience, but still piecing it together with a story instead of just being primarily eye candy like many other on the track VR experiences are. It's a real amazing piece of art and would highly recommend to anyone interested in any sort of psychdelic style experiences made for VR.","Nov 23, 2020 at 5:13 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:46:22.172892,FastLawyer,"Abstract, Trippy, Subversive Art","One of the best, if not the best, art experiences I have ever had in VR. The 3D effects are really good and the whole thing was just made for VR. It makes art into a living, breathing experience that you can only really get in VR. It has 5 different experiences, although some of the themes / assets are repeated so they share some commonalities. Whole thing takes about 30 minutes. I highly recommend it. It's a must buy if you love Art and VR.

2022-05-28 20:46:22.187852,Mushroomies,Fantastic,"This is like Salvador Dali on Steroids, 
Surreal worlds, This is a must have for your VR Library,
Make sure to always look around so you do not miss anything, You might see something going on in front of you while something else is happening behind you or next to you. This is really a wonderful creation of Sureal Art","Aug 9, 2020 at 9:03 PM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 20:46:25.287562,bruh466,,"It was kinda cool, its trippy as balls, and certanly interesting to look at but after a while it just kinda feels like it repeats itself, the same few assets doing different things :/, idk maybe its just me being picky","Sep 18, 2020 at 12:21 PM",3, 1,
2022-05-28 20:46:25.304517,TastyG,Incredible Experience,"It's a pretty short ""game"" its more like going though an art gallery than anything really. I can say that I loved every part of it, and if you've ever read ""Oh, the places you'll go"" by Dr. Seuss, Just imagine that in game form.","Aug 13, 2020 at 3:17 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 20:46:25.346404,ParaGamer,Expected more variety,"It's art so you have to be able to appreciate it, but for me it was a bit boring. 5 videos but all a bit the same.","Aug 18, 2020 at 3:18 AM",2, 2,
