2022-05-28 18:13:59.894197,DaveXM23,okay but confusing...,ok so when I played I did farm but then all of my people died despite having food? It has a great idea but needs work it also seemes that they wont be updating for a long time or might have even abondoned this game. I say that it just isnt worth the money unless you are willing to exchange 20$ for an ok playing experince. Now I truly dont know? Overall I didnt enjoy my experince.,"Mar 18, 2019 at 11:31 AM",2, 3,
2022-05-28 18:13:59.909157,vidarno,Abandoned Early Access title,"This title showed some promise nearly a year ago, when it was still being developed. Similar to Black & White you are a deity controlling some followers - the premise is good but at this stage there are just a few levels and it is missing some polish in both content and graphics.
But since there is no update of this game since July and the update before that was from the previous December it is obvious this game is abandoned.

I can't recommend this to anybody, except as an incomplete glimpse of how a Black & White game in VR *could* have been","Dec 23, 2017 at 4:15 AM",2, 21,

2022-05-28 18:13:59.939077,akaneo,Will be amazing when they fix these..,"I do fairly well with VR but dragging around the map makes me VERY nausious. I have to close my eyes as I move everytime, please make an easy way to teleport! Also, the lumber mill freezes up on level 3, I cannot beat the level and progress because all of the workers stop moving and stop producing randomly. 

Amazing concept and its so close to being great, many moments of THATS SO COOL but they get overwhlemed by the nausia and bugs.","Feb 25, 2017 at 7:10 AM",3, 3,
2022-05-28 18:13:59.954037,kevoripper,legit with potential,"Fun game with a promising platform.  Not a ton of content but enough to have fun and earn rewards.  Very much what everyone wished 'Black and White' was more like... future potential with more buildings, troops, spells, CoC style pvp would be very fun 5/5 for great platform","Feb 11, 2017 at 11:59 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:14:03.089650,Wolfe_Lord,great game good potentetial but...,"This is an amazing game I have had so much fun playing with it and slinging the roofs of my peoples houses into a volcano but one issue and this could be that I am just bad at VR games or that I dont have a big enough space but lvl 3 ""the greater God"" Is impossibly hard so hard that I just havent touched this game in weeks it needs to be nerfed a  bit to make it easier/ fairer","Jan 7, 2017 at 11:55 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:14:03.104610,golden13dragon,Great Concept!,"I always wanted to play a game where I can manipulate human objects and build houses, etc.... this game is satisfying for now. I hope developers will add more contents and improve to this game because I can see this game becoming very popular.","Dec 21, 2016 at 4:04 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:14:03.118573,N01773H,Early days but great start,"While this game is still in early development, it has a great foundation to work from. The locomotion system of dragging yourself around the planet (or rotating the planet around you?) is fun and easy to use. It isn't as sandboxy as Black and White or other god games of the past, but is still fun and shows lots of promise for future updates.","Dec 21, 2016 at 5:32 PM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 18:14:03.132535,RandyAndy_TV,Love it!,Just love this Game i think it is one of the best touch games (when you want to do more as just shoot ppl. what is also very nice with the controllers!),"Dec 25, 2016 at 7:34 AM",5, 1,
