2022-05-28 16:35:11.239196,Nozza74_Trick,Same as mobile version,"does what it says on the tin , same as mobile version . perfect for a quick game when u haven't much time to play .",Oct 20 at 5:32 AM,5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:35:11.254155,JimOnyx,stupid glitch on dis game,"yes, its very good. i loved the original mobile version. and this gave me a good time. but i took a small break and when i loaded it up. it would say something like ""txt.something"" for example and it would just keep me in the menu. when i would try to play it would just freeze (in the menu) but would play the sounds of the game running. i also tried restarting my computer and oculus but it didnt work.(aswell as uninstalling it and re-installing it). i might get a refund if i cant fix the problem. it really sucks because i really loved this game and i hate it being liek this. i hope they have a fix for it soon. but yes very noise :)",Aug 11 at 4:23 PM,2, 0,

2022-05-28 16:35:11.283078,Eksile,THE CONTROLS,"The game could be more fun, it seems when the game wants you to go in a certain direction it stiffens your movements. Unless I am missing something, the sensitivity is waaay off on this game.","Oct 26, 2018 at 9:01 PM",2, 17,
2022-05-28 16:35:11.298038,stephen1976430,NOT GREAT,"you don't get to do much like run round shooting, its not fun no Multiplayer or open world, 90s Resident Evil game is better and still great game to play at 32 bit ps one , into the dead should be a free to play game only ?","Dec 23, 2018 at 11:31 PM",1, 13,

2022-05-28 16:35:14.453599,JohnnyDioxin,Tedious,"Found this to be really tedious, mind-numbing and uninspiring. One of my first VR game purchases, but didn't let it put me off. This was just boredom.","Nov 27, 2017 at 6:21 AM",1, 19,

2022-05-28 16:35:17.637083,Worpath,its complicated,Mix of high and low star features.  Running mode feels like a phone game ported.  I had fun playing the standing shootout for a while...but it gets old fairly quick.  I dont regret playing for a while.,"May 14, 2017 at 1:58 PM",3, 9,
2022-05-28 16:35:17.652043,Wonzel,One of the best Games in the Store!,"This is one of the best VR-Games up to now. Its simple but the feeling is great if you run between the Zombies, grab guns or free one of the guard-dogs that will start to protect you against the horde of Zombies right away. I can play it for hours and it works nice with the controler. It contains also a ""last men standing"" level like in Serious Sam just with Zombies. There are a lot of different weapons and extras. I would just like to see more levels maybe like running in a big town. However, i give 5 Starts because it deserves it! ITS GREAT and even if you run there is no motion sickness at all like in other games! Believe me!! :-)","May 4, 2017 at 7:20 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 16:35:17.670993,lazdnet,Incredibly boring and repetative,"I was really hoping this would be a fun zombie shooter, but it's not. You run through a horde of zombies and try not to run straight into them, that's the game. Yes, there are guns, but no, it's not a shooter.","Jan 18, 2017 at 3:43 AM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 16:35:20.794638,JimShiddy,Eh.,"If you've seen a youtube vid on this game, you've seen everything you could ever care about it. A good idea but pisspoor execution.","Feb 3, 2017 at 11:28 AM",1, 4,
2022-05-28 16:35:20.809598,im.visualcortex,,"I want a full zombie game like this, not just a short session runner. Anyway it reminds me of one of my first ZX Spectrum games. And now it is one of my first VR games so 5 stars for good memories and great in-game atmosphere. Will definitely play it from time to time.","Dec 21, 2016 at 2:27 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 16:35:20.823561,Rapier503,First game I bought for the Rit,I bought this game first as I really wanted to shoot things and at the time it was the only game out with guns. I have played this game to death. It is a bit repititve at times that why only 4 stars. The developer should have made the zombies coming towards you level the main game rather than running.,"Dec 3, 2016 at 7:09 PM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 16:35:20.838521,AKnightAlone,Decent Arcade-Style Game,"I've played this a bit more than other VR experiences just because it works really well. You're constantly running forward so there's no need for potentially uncomfortable movement controls, just left and right, and you have a bunch of arcade-like unlocks for power-ups as far as your guns and dogs. Then there's a like 6 different modes to unlock, too. Totally worth it for the price compared to some of these crazy expensive games.","Dec 11, 2016 at 8:02 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 16:35:20.853481,falken76,,"This game straight up SUCKS.  Crap Mobile port.  It's a lame runner where you run full speed into a field with zombies.  I can't believe people like this crap. Do yourself a favor if you must try this, buy it from a place that allows you to get a refund.","Dec 4, 2016 at 5:08 AM",1, 2,
2022-05-28 16:35:23.925265,GOOSEtheMIGHTY,Great Game,One of the first I bought. Lots of modes and unlocks. Its also a great pass the headset game to share with your friends. Graphics are not anyhting special but still good considering its a MOBILE PORT.,"Dec 24, 2016 at 7:21 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 16:35:23.939227,Thendakor,OK,"If you've played the free mobile version, you'll know what to expect here.  No nausea as you're simply running forward.  The extra modes are a bonus.  For a quick pick up and play for 10 minutes it's worth a look.","Dec 5, 2016 at 4:02 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 16:35:23.968150,gmoney2748,I love this game,"I've had my Oculus since launch, and this game is the only one so far that keeps me coming back. While its not simply an arcade shooter, it has just the right amount of an arcadey feel to make me want to go for a new high score each time.","Oct 29, 2016 at 10:46 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 16:35:23.982113,cybernettr,Boring,"Basically just an on-rails dodging game. It's just nominally even VR, because you don't move at your own speed and you can't really look around to take in your environment. There's nothing to take in, anyway, just an unending cornfield or other boring setting. No matter how well you play, the game always ends with you ultimately dying--it's just a matter of how long it takes.","Oct 27, 2016 at 10:29 AM",1, 1,

2022-05-28 16:35:27.129694,UBSERD,This game has never fully worked for me.,"I've had this game for little over a year since I got the Rift. Since, I've had fresh installs on my PC several times, and no matter what it always was a juddery mess. This was reproduced on several computers and  always the same performance. Piss poor optimization. The sad part is I really like the game, but I can never recommend it because of the issues I've always had with it. I have a substantial PC as well so I know it's not on my end. Some devs just don't care it seems to keep up with the updates and that really sucks for the consumer. This is the only one star rating I've ever given and I feel it's well deserving.","Jul 28, 2016 at 8:47 AM",1, 2,
