Don't go into it assuming its going to be a perfectly polished game with lots of opportunities for interaction and puzzles- think of it as an especially fun exhibit in a science museum. 

On the whole I felt that it did a great job at teaching complicated physics by letting you observe for yourself what was happening, with narration to help you understand the visuals. It assumes you know some basics, so if it's been a while since you learned what a neutrino is, or about the light wavelength spectrum, you might want to look those up first!","Jun 24, 2021 at 6:30 AM",5, 1,

Yes, it's 3d VR, the 1 star review is invalid, maybe they expected another murder simulator? Sorry, this is science and education.","Jan 16, 2020 at 4:42 PM",5, 7,

Violence is all games are about now, a refection of a brainless society unfortunately.

This is something to learn.
