It shows the ""built with Unity"" message and then bounces back out to the home environment.  I've tried deleting it, and reinstalling, but it still doesn't work.  I'd definitely like to try it, since I played the original game at U.C. Berkeley, when it was new.  It would be great to revisit that first tenuous contact with V.R., but no go, so far.",Mar 14 at 5:15 AM,2, 1,

There are some neat easter eggs and the presentation is top notch.  I wish it had a two player mode, but that doesn't hold this back from being a peak free VR experience.",Nov 17 at 2:08 PM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 19:37:02.976787,joepastafari,thx,i did that secret desert level it gave me chills bro it was awsome thx for remaking this beacuse i was to young to experiance it in the 90s,Jul 9 at 10:33 AM,5, 1,
2022-05-28 19:37:06.104548,Pixie40,"The good, the bad, the eyebleed","To start with, it's wonderful that this piece of VR history has been so lovingly recreated. Where I live, VR never really took off. That said, ever since I first heard of it being real I wanted to give VR a try. And it's amazing what was done with old Amega computers. It wasn't until 2019 that I was finally able to experience VR. And I was right about it blowing me away.

As soon as I saw this, I knew I had to give it a shot. And it is interesting to experience what it would have been like in the 90's to play early VR games. This is something I think everyone should try at least once. That said, my god. The polygons are so eyebleed inducingly bright. Yeah, I know that's what it was like back then due to hardware limitations. But ow. And the frame rates... Yea gods, it makes you appreciate the buttery smooth modern VR experience.

EDIT: fixed a reference after doing research
EDIT 2: I see the AI for the opponents has been fixed so they shoot back now. While it's not multiplayer like the original, it does mean you get a bit more of an authentic experience.",Mar 5 at 7:25 AM,3, 6,"thanks. actually the framerate is way to hi and i wish it could be emulated down to the 24fps it probably was :D

Best regards to you and thanks for the review <3"
2022-05-28 19:37:06.118511,KingGhostler,"Amazing recreation, love it!","I am not old enough to remember this game but remember reading a technology magazine with interesting topics and this game was in it as the first mainstream VR game to the public and I forgotten what the name was for a long time, i was thinking about the photos and the world within it until Nostalgia Nerd did a video about the history of VR and found he mention this modern port/recreation.

I gotta say thanks for making this and doing a swell job at it, I am sure it's just about true to the original as it can be especially on the Oculus Rift systems.

you consider putting this on Steam or WMR store in the future? I feel everyone should try this someday.","Sep 12, 2020 at 12:15 PM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 19:37:06.149428,UglyBarnacle,Fantastic,"as Someone who was born in the late 90's, This is one way to experience what vr was like in 91' i didnt get to experience vr intill the modern era but im glad someone recreated this for someone who wasn't born early enough to try this.  Early step into the Vr world and now its even better today!","Sep 5, 2019 at 6:04 AM",5, 6,"It was even worse than this, the frame rate was mind bogglingly slow and it was like having a shoebox strapped to you head with a tiny 640*480 at the far end :D"
2022-05-28 19:37:06.165385,Jesusavesouls,I was kid in the the 70s,Had a sears atari and got pong at a yard sale.But when I started seeing fmv and documentries on vr in early 90 I figured it would be years before any poor person could try it.Besides the imagination and vr story driven movies it wouldnt arrive for another 25 years .Jesusavesouls !,"Sep 6, 2019 at 3:38 AM",5, 3,Yeaa...i know. these HMDs was made for universities and tech companies with money. the first one for the common people was the VFX1 and it was 700$ in sweden. Could run Doom and demos but not real fancy VR worlds like the Virtuality systems. so the dream died young :/
2022-05-28 19:37:09.273185,SvenViking,Great VR museum piece,"Like many others, Dactyl Nightmare was my first introduction to VR. I'm really glad this exists for both nostalgia purposes and as an example of what early VR was like -- really enjoyed trying it again. I also think the creator did an excellent job under the given circumstances, so any flaws I list below are just intended to set appropriate expectations for players and in case any of them may still be able to be addressed in an update.

AI is basically just there to give you something to shoot at. Not a problem if you just want to experience it as a museum piece rather than as an actual game (the original was multiplayer), but it would be nice if there was a hard mode which simply made the AI more aggressive.

The reduced FOV mode is great, but as someone else pointed out antialiasing combined with simple shapes and solid colours makes the original resolution look not that much lower than the full Rift resolution. I'd really suggest just disabling antialiasing altogether if there's any problem changing it in realtime.

A 15fps mode would also be great. If this is Unity, in theory it should be able to be set with:
QualitySettings.vSyncCount = 0;
Application.targetFrameRate = 15;
(Try putting the targetFrameRate line in Update() if it keeps being reset to 90.)

The gun has a couple of bugs that aren't important (and I admit I'm not certain they weren't in the original). The projectile isn't visible on the barrel after you respawn, and sometimes when you fire just as your gun reloads the projectile has some unintended force applied (perhaps because it's the same object being reused and still has momentum from the previous frame?)

I thought players used to explode when a dactyl dropped them onto the board, rather than falling through, but could be wrong.

P.S. Really glad you didn't forget the ability to shoot the dactyl! :)","Oct 19, 2018 at 12:03 PM",4, 8,"You are all to kind! My work is more made out of love to the nostalgic vr era, and at best a laughful pies of badly made software with more ""bugs"" than a pile of leaves ;D

I'm hopefully will start with an upgrade this fall, aiming at Multiplayer and possibly a Oculus GO version.
I will definitely contact you on oculus dev forum about trying to set the Framerate! it was something a fail to do in the release because no one seems to know how to do it. And you are totally right about the dropping /exploding part. It was too much for me to implement at the time, because i hade to prioritise the making of the score interface and my Easter Eggs X-D"
2022-05-28 19:37:09.290139,AgentOrangeJuice,Man this takes me back.,"I love it. Makes me relive those days, when we spend hot summer nights at the Virtuality Cafe at Adenauer Platz. Wish it was multiplayer, so I could play an nostalgia round with my old chums.","Jul 2, 2018 at 1:06 AM",5, 4,".Thanks! Love you like by humble contribution to the VR scene.
I will probably sometime in the future get my things together and make it into multiplayer, but for the moment ther is no time, sorry :)"

I liked the game the first 15 minutes.
After that .... no thx.","Mar 11, 2018 at 1:41 AM",1, 0,"Yes it's supposed to do so. and here you can learn all there is to this ""recreated classic""     https://youtu.be/L60wgPuuDpE"
2022-05-28 19:37:09.322054,FastLawyer,I don't get it,"So I read all the reviews and I dig nostalgia.  But this game is just not very good.  Slow, plodding gameplay that seems to have no point.  But hey, it didn't crash and it's free.  And you can reminisce and then be thankful that we have much better games now in 2018.","Feb 10, 2018 at 4:01 PM",2, 1,"Hi. No problem, i take it you are a little to young to know about the Virtuality Arcade platform. The only major difference in this version, its single player and the original was made for 2-4 players in a score deathmatch. (atleast 2£ a game)
And it actually was nothing more to it! But it was a marvel to behold because it was the first commercial VR Game to hit the big audience. If you like to learn more try goggle ;)"
2022-05-28 19:37:09.337014,Messierhunter,The Atari of VR,"I had the chance to experience the original Dactyl back in the early 90's at a state fair, and though it was primitive and limited, I was immediately bitten by the VR bug.  I could not have imagined that over 20 years later I would be playing the same game once more on my own equipment.  Thanks for this fantastic piece of nostalgia and a reminder of how far the technology has come.  Nice easter eggs too.","Oct 16, 2017 at 7:01 PM",5, 6,"love you liked it! It was the same for me back then, i dreamed of commercial VR from the 90´s and until the first DK1 was released. i'm still not a real dev, lacks coding experience, but my goal is to someday add multiplayer to this piece of junk :)"
2022-05-28 19:37:12.430879,cybernettr,This game is history,"This is a fun little trip thru time for VR history buffs. I never played the original game but I did see the ABC documentary on YouTube, and I can imagine the excitement of playing this game on Virtuality back in the 90s. One star deducted because the object of the game is not entirely clear. Also, it would be nice to have a few more NPCs (perhaps a little more aggressive) and more action, because I want to say ""You're gone, John, you're history"" (inside joke).","Jul 25, 2017 at 10:38 AM",4, 3,"i can only apologise far all that is missing in this game, and believe me i'm fully aware of all the faults and error. But remember i'm still a total noob dev, doing this on my free time. i'm only starting to understand scripting and my 3d modeling is actually that bad! X-)

If there is time i will make this into a multiplayer game like it was back in the 90s, the object is only to kill or be killed gathering points. simple arcade game :)

i would <3 to one day make it a hiscore game listing the best of the best. remember i have more than a year in training myself :D

thanks for the review and all your stars :)"
2022-05-28 19:37:12.446837,vtid,THIS was what made me interested in VR!,"It turns out that the original of this game, was the game I saw 20+ years ago on TV when I was a kid - That 2 minutes from a TV show is the sole reason that I became interested in the idea of VR, and subsequently lead me to buy the Rift 20+ years later.  To get a chance to get as close to playing the real thing as possible, is something I'm glad to have experienced now; having never tried VR back in the day.  It's clearly not worth playing this today when compared to other titles, but the nostalgia here is great :) I have to give 5 stars for replication, all the little touches in there and the nostalgia factor too.  I'll probably pick it up once a year, but that's not the point.  My VR journey feels more satisfying knowing I've now played THAT game (almost).  Thank you to the developer for making this possible, and it's refreshing to see devs actually responding to some of the reviews too.  Hats off to you.","Aug 22, 2018 at 1:46 AM",5, 3,"Same for me! Dactyl Nightmare started my whole VR journey and i dreamt of recreating the game from the first DK1 took of. 
And this is exactly why i wanted to share the experience and all my dev time spent. To let others get a glimpse of the lost VR era. :)

Love you like my humble contribution. I will continue to develop this in time and keep it playable for everyone. :)

2022-05-28 19:37:12.478751,neuro27,Glad this exists,"This game is well done, bringing you back to the 90s. It's hard to criticize because everything wrong is actually what's right with the game. It's a great emulation of what VR was 26 years ago. It takes 5 minutes to check out, but it's worth it for the nostalgia :)","Jun 13, 2017 at 7:16 AM",4, 2,"Love you like the nostalgia! well there is lot to improve in fact, to make it even more like the original game. it was my sole point to make it as close the original as possible but its actually my own lack of dev skills slowing the progress. thanx for the review :)"

I had the chance to experience Dactyl Nightmare in the 90's, and this ""remaster"" deleivers all the excitement of the original, and adds a few easter eggs for even more enjoyment.","Jul 6, 2017 at 2:37 AM",5, 1,"Thanks. i love to here its gives people the possibility to once again visit this simple but magic place the ""nightmare"" was :)

2022-05-28 19:37:12.511663,Brengles_Beard,Five Stars For All The Feels,"When I was twelve years old I played this game in an arcade only one time. Then I never found it again. I searched every arcade I came across after that but wouldn't get to try VR again until I realized I was able to make a headset for my phone and download games from the Google Play Store 22 years later. My memory of the game is a little bit different than this but it's still awesome. And the terrible AI reminds me of playing against my brother, who was unable to kill me even once, and never got a chance for a rematch.","May 25, 2017 at 10:22 PM",5, 2,"haha thanks! Its possible you played the later versions named ""Dactyl Nightmare"" and  ""Dactyl Nightmare SP"" or even ""Dactyl Nightmare 2"". they were working on the same platform and scattered around the world. and they are in fact very mush different in gameplay and graphics."
2022-05-28 19:37:15.635415,Frogacuda,Pretty close to how I remember it,"Dactyle Nightmare was the first widely available VR arcade title, and for many it was their first introduction to VR. This little demo recreates that experience, and does a pretty good job. It's not 100% accurate, and with terrible enemy AI and no multiplayer it isn't much of a game, but I really liked the nostalgia of it.","May 25, 2017 at 8:59 AM",4, 1,thanks! i know the AI is terrible but that is because i'm a self learned dev with zero dev background. this will hopefully be changed in a future update. thanx for the review :)
