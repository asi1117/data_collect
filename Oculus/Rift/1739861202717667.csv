2022-05-28 18:49:19.442191,Choo_hehimlvl3,"Fun game, excellent Dev","Like many others I was having fun with the game until the Facebook/Oculus account linking lead to me being unable to play.  I contacted both Oculus Support and the Dev, and the dev was extremely helpful via email.  We went back and forth a bit, and eventually they released a test version they had coordinated with Oculus on generating, and after that I was able to play without problem!

The game itself is a tower defense game + wave shooter with some fun variety of weapons.  I found myself cycling through different uses rapidly in order to cover the field in explosions and blaster fire both, all while my towers filled in the blank spots.  The enemies range from little skittery beasties, to huge stompers that take a ton to bring down.  Definitely worth the price of admission!","Apr 14, 2021 at 5:59 AM",5, 0,"Glad to read you enjoyed it, we enjoyed making it!"
2022-05-28 18:49:19.457151,Joe,This game was so much fun until it just,"This game was so much fun until it just stopped letting me play after a week.  Now when I start it u, the in-game voice just tells me “Operator, You aren’t entitled to play with me.”  Literally have never seen this happen in a game before.  I paid for it and can’t play it.  Otherwise this game was freaking awesome, for the short period of time I could play it.  Oculus people what in the world did you do here?  Is this because of the Facebook account linking?  Can deactivating and then re-activating our Facebook accounts corrupt games that people have purchased?  Would give this game 5 stars if you didn’t have weird issues on your end.","Nov 29, 2020 at 1:10 PM",5, 9,"Hey joegreendude, I am terribly sorry you experienced this. Yes, this is some side effect of the Oculus+FB account merging thing that happened this year (as if the year wasn't bad enough already). Other users have received help from Oculus support to fix this.

Oh, and cool you like the game, we put a lot of effort into making it - super happy to hear you enjoy it!"

2022-05-28 18:49:22.627671,UnderLondon,well thought out game,"So i have only played this for an hour or so but my initial thoughts on the game are as follows;
> excellant value for money, even at the discounted price that i payed I would have been happy pay 4 times the price
> There has been a lot of care and attention put into this game by developers who obviously are doing it for the love of the game experience and not profits.
> The game doesnt try to be anything that it isint; its a tower style 1st person shooter that excels in its simplicity and provides exactly what you need in a |VR game.
> Although I havent played to the end and based upon some of the other reviews that would like the game to be longer I think the replayability will come from the choice of weapon upgrades which provide a different tactical approach.

All in all a good little game for the money and one i highly reconmend","Sep 2, 2020 at 10:47 AM",4, 2,"Thank you, super glad you liked it! And yes, we did this game very much for the love of making a VR experience we could be proud of."

This sounds strange, hopefully not a bug. While you play you stash up Voronium to buy turrets on the ground. The Development of new weapons for the Zeus is something you can do between levels, when you have high enough Voronium level overal.

(Yes, maybe the Voronium counting system is not that obvious...)"
2022-05-28 18:49:22.671553,Corehavoker,Impressed for the price,"More than what I expected, got it on sale and played for a little under an hour. Graphics are enjoyable and it just is pleasant over all!","Aug 27, 2020 at 10:37 AM",4, 0,Thank you! I will pass this on to the relevant person. Enjoy!

2022-05-28 18:49:25.790212,pjmarshall,Great Game,"I had little expectations for the game, but it was on sale and I noticed the devs constantly connectong with the community, so I tried it even though I am not that into tower defense. Game has a lot heart and even if I had paid full price, I would not have been upset with the devs for lack of content. This kind of game design is very difficult, and you tell the devs cared a lot about this project. May not be my favorite game, but solid title, even if a little repetitive.","Sep 25, 2019 at 11:26 AM",5, 3,"Hey Pjmarshall, thank you for the kind words - we put our heart and soul in this! Early mornings, late nights. I am glad you enjoyed it!"
2022-05-28 18:49:25.806169,Masamune5454,excellent,"now this is based off the sale price, which may have been 3 dollars or less. that said this games great. you have 4 turrets and 1 slow down turret. the turrets are upgradable, and one of them is a manned machine called zues. now the game starts in a zero g spaceshipey thing, and you go the screen and command these things like enders game. so the console is where your body is, and where you choose maps and upgrades. the zues weapons must be purchased, but i wish it went deeper and had more upgrades for the weapons. also the maps seemed short, where just as i get a ton of money and set up turrets the maps done, it would be better to have no time limit, and just make it where you collect voronium over time, so longer time spent and dealing with it being more diffucult would reward you with more stored voronium. now do i think its 15 bucks worth, probably not, but on sale i loved it. i would spend 15 if they did a update and made it more replayable. maybe each area you have to rebuy the upgrades, and more vareity in general, but i liked it overall.","Jul 15, 2019 at 2:42 AM",4, 9,"Thanks for the positive feedback - we put so much blood, sweat, and tears into this title (first VR title we made). Unfortunately by the time we released it so many titles came out and the competition did not allow us to continue.

If we find the time at some point, we will release a few things we made (like a zero gravity gun) but just didn't get time to finalize."
2022-05-28 18:49:25.822127,aHappyDroid,Fun Tower Defense Game,I wish you had the option to full speed time while just watching your defenses wreck the enemies rather than being constrained to one low side of the map at a time.,"Aug 10, 2019 at 3:23 AM",4, 1,"Super glad you like it - we used to have a ""speed-up"" button, I think it was when you clicked the ""clock"" in the control drone. Maybe we disabled it to avoid people unintentionally clicking it and getting massively frustrated that the Locusts overran the place in no time."
2022-05-28 18:49:28.961729,taquitobuddy,"Nice demo, but needs much more","While the core idea and mechanics of this are pretty good, this game would need so much more content/features to feel like a full game and be worth recommending.  There are no in-game options, only 3 turrent types with 1 other module, and the upgrades for your main gun platform are lacking.  This would be a very nice demo if there was a full game afterwards.","Mar 6, 2019 at 10:21 PM",2, 2,"Hi Annatar,

I am sorry you experienced it more like a demo than an actual title. We tried to give it some flow in terms of the 3x3 maps, and the ability to upgrade turrets, the Zeus, etc. and hence create an experience of progress.

One thing we struggled a lot with was making it ""easy"" and ""hard"" enough at the same time. Some people are super adapt with VR and others have a hard time making it work. Maybe we should have added difficulty levels.

But thank you for trying it out!"
2022-05-28 18:49:28.976689,RuneSR2,Too repetitive - bland graphics,"I do love great shooters and thought that this one had potential. I didn't experience any technical problems and the game does have some nice graphics in the spaceship, but texture quality outside the spaceship is lacking in detail. Compared to other Rift shooters, this game seemed mediocre, unfortunately. There are some nice elements of upgrading weapons and equipment, but it couldnt't hide the fact that I easily got bored. Too many of the same/similar enemies - and having to focus several places almost simulatanously is not great gameplay - it's more annyoing, stressful and not fun. Gameplay didn't feel sufficiently balanced. Furthermore there're no settings to adjust in-game, which felt kinda strange. And there's no free locomotion. It mostly felt like a wave shooter, where you're locked into a few positions using cleverly hidden teleport controls, and I've played too many wave shooters in VR to appreciate new ones, sadly. The game was nice performance-wise, then again this game is far from reference VR shooters like Doom VFR and Evasion. This could be a great game, but it would require a lot more work by the devs - add free locomotion, add tons of new enemies and then add some awesome high-res textures. Note that the recommended video card on Steam is GTX 1060, not GTX 1050 like in here. I do believe that GTX 1050 is way too slow to be the recommended video card for this game.","Feb 5, 2019 at 5:13 AM",3, 4,"Hi RuneSR2,

Thank you for your feedback. Very interesting that you felt you were lacking free locomotion. We discussed this so many times - but since we didn't want to risk motion sickness for the player we kept the game play as you describe.

Also its interesting you mention the frustration with multiple places to focus - this was also an aspect we discussed a lot. We ended up agreeing that the best compromise was the time-warp which allows you to spend time deciding where to go - but as this is a tower defense game you must also plan for how to protect angles where you cannot be present.

Unfortunately the studio is currently on hold - but we do have a few features finished which just weren't released... maybe we find the time one evening to push them out."
2022-05-28 18:49:28.992647,Orioops,Fun but has a steep difficulty curve,"Game is challenging, fun, and refreshing to play. The first levels slowly introduce you to the locust, but as soon as the strider gets involved it almost seems like it goes from easy to master difficulty. Was super fun even though it was a random burst of difficulty, just seemed out of the blue and made me feel unprepared. Managing multiple spots can be a headache and almost seem impossible if you don't have the resources for turrets yet. Overall fun game, but not for people who don't want an instant challenge for their reactions along side multi-tasking.","Nov 23, 2018 at 5:48 AM",3, 11,"Hi Orioops,

Thank you so much for your feedback. We know that the learning curve from Alpha to Delta region is a bit steep. We are adjusting the spawnplans on levels based on the feedback we get. Even though the game is single player we can update this on our backend server to adjust for a more smooth learning curve. So hang in there - and don't get too depressed if it takes a couple of tries before you nail the harder levels ;-)

Have Fun!
