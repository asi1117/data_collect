I own touch controllers, but i don't like them, and therefore I feel cheated when told they are not needed, but then they are...
Every one is supposed to like touch, 'why no touch support' for games clearly not benefiting from touch support even... This game could have been made to work with the x-box controller as well as touch...","Mar 24, 2018 at 4:44 AM",2, 2,"If you check the stores top right box (on your browser) it clearly states ""Oculus Touch required"" (Comfortable, Platform: Rift, Oculus Touch required, Internet connection not required, Single User)."
2022-05-28 19:44:55.060115,dk_ny,Good room escape!,"This game turned out to be better than expected. Pretty good graphics and puzzles. I enjoyed it. Looking for extra hidden stuff to steal was fun as well. I will be replaying the game until I find it all.
Given the low price I can definitely recommend this one. Give it a try!","Mar 16, 2018 at 5:28 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:44:55.078067,EagleLB22,Fine app! Some sound fx kill immersion.,"Thoroughly enjoying this app! Great atmosphere, solid visuals, responsive touch controls, and mildy-complex puzzles help round out this 'escape-esque' title. My one gripe is questionable sound effect implementation. For example, the polaroid pictures and the yellow note on the refrigerator both sound like I'm dropping a book when placing them on countertops or other hard surfaces. Another is the refrigerator.. When opening and closing, it sounds like one of the latched cabinets found throughout the game. Lastly, when any solid object collides with the glass windows throughout the house, it produces sounds like a wind chime. Though minor, these can be immersion killers for some ( like me :) ) All-in-all, great title. Can't wait to see more from this group!","Mar 19, 2018 at 9:02 AM",4, 2,I agree and changed the sound effects for the windows and fridge. Papers are a bit difficult as it is but I tried to improve it somewhat. Thank you for playing and thanks for your feedback!
2022-05-28 19:44:55.095021,borgiamas,Puzzler with Episode of Popeye!,"I have really enjoyed this so far. If you like puzzles and escape room style games, then I think this is worth it.. Also, the single episode of Popeye's was a great addition. I definitely watched the entire thing!","Mar 14, 2018 at 7:26 AM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:44:55.112973,SpiderBatPig,Great escape room,"Was great fun. I managed to play it siting down, would reccomend standing though. Really enjoyed the end. Cant wait for the next escape room! Only issue was the submachine gun was a bit glitchy.","Mar 17, 2018 at 1:29 PM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 19:44:58.248146,Parallax5227,Fun Quick Puzzle Game,Pretty quick but just the right difficulty to challenge but not frustrate. Very nice looking visuals. Vocal work leaves a little to be desired.,"Mar 15, 2018 at 12:35 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:44:58.263106,Tarkatta,pretty good.,Puzzle/escape room. Looks good and controlls fine. It's cheap give it a try.,"Mar 15, 2018 at 10:37 AM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 19:44:58.280061,Josh6499,Fun little mystery game,"The dev gave me a key for free on reddit. 

I really liked the environment for this game, the house is rendered really well. You definitely feel like you're there. The tiger's model looks really out of place though. 

The controls are great too, I've got no complaints there. 

There's a lot of objects to interact with. Just exploring the house is really fun. 

Thumbs up from me!","Mar 20, 2018 at 2:26 AM",5, 2,
