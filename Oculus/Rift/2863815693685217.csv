The tutorial explains everything and the whole thing is very intuitive.

My 8 year old son followed the tutorial and made an Oxygen atom.
Within 30 minutes he'd completed Gold and Uranium all of his own accord.

He had no idea how electrons worked before this but now has a visual sense of it and it will stick.
Now he's curious to know ""why"" the electrons behave that way - perfect!

Abelana are doing amazing things here, can't wait to see what they produce next.

Solid 5 star rating, I'd give 10 stars if I could, chemistry can seem confusing but not after playing with this for a while.",Nov 28 at 6:18 AM,5, 1,

2022-05-28 20:39:11.913681,FabryReloaded,NOT EASY ALSO TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO.,"First of all I'm Italian and there's not my own language but I can understand it. It's your own, the Application, and your decision. But I look for an Educational Application where I can understand better the chem and this is just for who the chem. which knows it well. Very very difficult also the tutorial.. not satisfied, disappointed. Will ask a refund.","Nov 7, 2020 at 12:57 AM",2, 2,
