2022-05-28 18:23:52.230908,GrahamFord,Astronaut Dragon Puppeteer? Yes Please!,"I won't lie. As a kid, I dreamt of becoming an astronaut. It was a lofty goal. But an astronaut who can puppeteer space dragons, able to shoot laser beams from their mouths on a mission to free interstellar space giants? I probably dreamt of that too…in my dreams. This game was stellar. If youre on the fence, take a minute and think what this game could mean for you right now. With coronavirus boxing us in, I’ve never felt more claustrophobic. Living in relatively small quarters all day, only periodically venturing outside, and even then, mostly just to get into an also small and cramped car to drive to a fast food drive thru! Enclosed in my car driving to that Wendy’s, the one thing that gives a sense of EXPANSE is the visual, can't hear anything outside those air tight windows. So it was masterful, when I put on my VR headset and launched into outer space, confined by nothing, no vehicle, no small room, limited only by the speed at which I could fly through the stars. All that pent up sense of claustrophobia completely disappeared. It’s ironic that the game starts with being imprisoned, quickly enacting escape into the vastness of space…where all space dragons should be free to roam. Side Note: beat the game and there's a pretty galatic in-game reward. I was only able to give this 5 stars, but to fit with the context, I think it should more accurately recieve 5...planets? Supernovas? Space Dragons? Yes, this deserves 5 Space Dragon thumbs up.","Apr 8, 2020 at 8:20 AM",5, 7,
2022-05-28 18:23:52.245868,DreamerO,"Goes from ""yeah cool"" to REALLY COOL","This is my go to game whenever I wish my hands were dragons. Certainly the best of the dragon-hand genre, and takes it to another level. 

The first few levels you think to yourself ""This is pretty cool to be space dragons blowing up stuff"" but then as the enemies become bigger and the levels more complex it really surprises you with how good it is. 

Worth full price but it's a steal on sale","Jan 1, 2019 at 10:44 AM",5, 8,

2022-05-28 18:23:55.404420,DeadEcho81,A hidden diamond!,"Are you one of the many guys who are looking for a game that resembles VR like you have seen it in ""The Lawnmower-Man? This is as close as you can get so far! fast flying, freedom of movement, moody graphics/environments and smooth gameplay. IMO one of the best games for the rift so far. Challenging and relaxing at the same time!","Apr 4, 2018 at 1:38 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 18:23:55.434340,FastLawyer,"Like Xortex, but with dragons and better","So this is in essence a bullet hell shooter.  However, it feels a lot cooler than that, especially with your VR hands being dragons.  You shoot stuff, you blow up planets, you avoid bullets.   You pick up health bars.  You listen to heavy metal.  You down bosses.  Then you warp the @#$# out of there.  Sound cool? @#$#@ yeah! Rating 7/10.","Dec 8, 2017 at 3:15 AM",4, 7,
2022-05-28 18:23:55.449300,bri_tar,Attack of the Astro-Monsters!,Imagine a VR version of all your fav early years arcade sci-fi shooters but playing as King Ghidorah... This is that game. Made real by dogs nuts grass roots programmers. Its awesome!! The controls take a few mins to get to grips with but when it clicks the experience is more than worth it! Great job devs. Scary to think what a few more quid thrown at you would result in... Keep it up! ;),"Nov 7, 2017 at 5:14 AM",5, 5,
