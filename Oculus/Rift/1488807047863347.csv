I do wish that more people played it, because the wait time for multiplayer battles is a little long (1-5 minutes), but I noticed recently the wait time has been going down, and more are playing. I think a great addition would be some sort of leaderboard for the multiplayer battles to see where you rank. And upgrading individual towers for less, rather than all of that troop type, like if I want one archer tower fire and the other not.","Mar 30, 2019 at 7:11 AM",5, 2,

2022-05-28 17:20:22.074196,Zathereth,Amazing,"The game is very fun. it is beautifully created ground up for VR. The game is so immersive, utilizing the Oculus touch hand movements in-game. They make everywhere from placing a tower to moving around the map using anchors feel like you are actually there commanding this place and panicking when your castle is under attack. I wish there were options to further increase the graphics, because even on ultra it is still pretty pixely which could be changed by allowing us to increase the resolution or AA. Hopefully more content will be added, BALANCED content to the full game. I will absolutely be buying sometime soon.","Dec 31, 2018 at 5:35 AM",5, 3,

Then someone explained to me that you get game breaking units that speed up your army movement when you buy this game that the users of the free version don't. Kind of makes the 1v1 matches completely one sided and pointless unless you get matched against another player who uses the free version. And it definitely doesn't make me want to support the devs by paying for this game.

Edit: 
Ok thanks, I didn't realize that I could change my presets. It's too bad the pallet customization isn't available but I'll take another look.","Sep 27, 2018 at 10:00 PM",5, 5,"Brass Tactics Arena (free version) does have the exact same units that are available in the full game. The one thing that is not available in the free version is pallet customization.

Brass Tactics ""Arena"" is the free version of Brass Tactics; it comes with one map in each mode and has lots of replay value. If the free version doesn't quench your thirst for strategy and glorious victory, the full version will more than satiate the need to raise an army and leading it to annihilate your enemies. Definitely worth the download just to try it out.","Jul 8, 2018 at 2:02 PM",5, 12,

Although, considering that this is the free version there are alot of things locked and little to no maps to play with.  Still a very fun family-friendly game, and not much violence really, just fires and warriors perishing.

If this game came out 4 years from now, it would get no attention and mediocore ratings. That being said, we're in early VR.

Midgame is where this shines, prioritising the right units in the right location against the correct enemies is very busy.
Very satisfying, fun to learn and the controls are just fantastic.","Apr 27, 2018 at 11:09 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:20:31.532898,RayTroGames,Troubles with online game,"A really awesome game, but I am experiencing some issues in online versus. The game seems to desynchronize over time. When i talk to my opponent about the time he sees on the wall we observe several minutes of difference. The 'late' player won't be able to place towers, move allies, and so on. It's really annoying, it feels like a connection drop, but for some reason the game can't come back to a stable state after this. I hope you can find a solution to this, I really want to buy the full game but this issue is preventing me for the moment.

2022-05-28 17:20:31.562817,chrisnolet,Exceptional Game,"Brass Tactics captures the all magic of Age of Empires, tailored perfectly for VR. It's the first VR game I've really felt was a great game. (Not just 'teleport here, shoot that' – but a detailed game, with intricate gameplay, that can compete with non-VR offerings.) The campaign is nice, although a little short. Where this game really shines, though, is with online PvP. Matches are intense and varied, and the community is friendly. (Hidden Path have been quick to balance units as the meta evolves, too.) The extra maps and ability to customize your loadout, in the full version, are well worth it.","Mar 3, 2018 at 5:17 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 17:20:31.577777,VinnyGunnz,,"This is a must play game.  Already pre-ordered the full version.  I'm not into playing other people so I like that there is a campaign and solo mode.  I hope they continue to develop the game after release, adding new maps or ability of players to make maps and upload for other users.  It would also be cool if they had other themes besides robotic.  I loved AOE 3 so I'd love to see little people and horses and ships in place of robots.  That would probably be another game or expansion or something though.  At any rate, I can't wait for the full release.","Feb 20, 2018 at 9:57 AM",5, 6,

Sure, this game may not be as huge as some other RTS games but the amazing feeling of seeing them moving in 3D space following your commands feels great. My only complaint is that people seem to have a tendency of leaving the game. Like common, play to the end. But this is not the game's fault of course. I will certainly buy the whole game when I get money.","Mar 6, 2018 at 1:54 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 17:20:34.679481,jaypejay,Excelent game!,"This game deserves all the praise that it gets, as a veteren of Starcraft and Warcraft 3 this game has a surprising amount of depth. There is economic harassment, there are tech considerations, counters, builds, micro, macro, it's pretty much got everything.  The voice acting is also extremely well done which is something I normally skip. The only thing I'd like to see is matchmaking as I feel bad playing against newer players, and I don't really know how I stack up against other players.","Mar 18, 2018 at 12:27 PM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 17:20:34.694441,M.Pizzle.McDizzle,"Beautiful graphics, gameplay lacking","It hurts me to give this game 3 stars, as I think it's absolutely beautiful and a step in the right direction when it comes to the RTS genre for VR, but we're still not quite there yet.

The controls are mostly great, navigating around the map and using the menus to get new buildings and upgrades feels incredibly seamless, but unit selection (especially when selecting multiple units) can be frustrating at times. Additionally, with the pre-selected build spots and the limited initial units you get, your early strategy is going to feel very repetitive. It's no Starcraft, but it doesn't have to be, but I feel the gameplay should be a little more varied.

I played as much as the demo allowed, exploring all unit types and strategies. I really wanted to like the game, but it's just an extremely primitive RTS that I know would feel like a chore after a while. Not for me, but it seems to be getting lots of 5 star reviews, so what do I know?","Feb 17, 2018 at 4:16 AM",3, 5,

2022-05-28 17:20:34.728351,HoodyNynja,Steampunk Game of Thrones,"One of the best VR games I have played so far, and the price is impossible to beat! 

A Real Time Strategy (RTS) game with pacing in between an Age of Empires and Starcraft/Warcraft.  Easy and intuitive mechanics for building sructures, as well as commanding units.

The combat begins with a simple rock (Warrior), paper (Archer), scissor (Cavalry) format, but quickly adds depth with unit upgrades that can reverse that flow of strengths.  Graphics are well done, with a lot of attention to detail on unit, map and animations (think of the opening of Game of Thrones when you build towers or upgrade yor base).

A very basic tutorial, and only one map for play against AI, but that is understandable since the rest is locked behind buying the full Brass Tactics game.  This however, still allows full features of Solo vs AI, co-op vs AI, and PVP, albeit with limited customization options.","Feb 16, 2018 at 9:56 AM",5, 5,

I am aware that this is a beta test or whatever, but come one, 20 of 20 lost connection is insane.
When I get past the 1st 1 minute without disconnect, it always remains until the end if the game, but having 95% disc in the 1st 1 minute is crazy.

Even if you're not much into strategy games, do try this game - it's quite addictive and has a great tutorial. Controls are intuitive and because of the amazing VR, I have never - ever - experienced a better game within it's genre.
The game runs perfectly using supersampling at 2.0 on a GTX 1080 - graphics set to High. Ultra setting seems only to add FSAA, and there's no need for FSAA using supersampling at 2.0 (activated using Oculus Tray Tool).

Solo battles seem to work well however.
Update: Just noticed it may be locked until you buy it? If so then this is NOT indicated in the game at all. Also there does not seem to be any purchase options. So if this is an early access game then that is also not made clear. Update 2: After digging around google I finally figured out that it is not released yet.

2022-05-28 17:20:41.062409,ChaosWarlock,Great game! Matchmaking issue fixed!,"This review was update based on the fix that was rolled out for the matchmaking issues and the release of the full version.  I have not seen any matchmaking disconnects since the patch.

Overall this game is a blast to play.  Easy to learn the basics.  Controls took a bit of getting used to but by a couple games into it they start feeling natural.  Movement was very comfortable.  I'm not super sensitive to VR sickness but I do have some games I can only play for a short time, or on ""comfort mode"".  This didn't make me uncomforable at all.  I could play it for hours.  

If you like RTS games, at first glance, this may not seem as involved as the top non-VR RTS games but there are a lot of little nuances and strategies you can employ.  If you aren't into RTS games I'd still really recommend it as it is a bit simpler to pick up than it's non-VR competitors.  And playing this kind of game in VR is just awesome.  It basically has you hovering above a table building towers and moving units around to attack your enemies.

There are however a few things that could use some improvement.  These are however very minor and not enough to knock my rating down a full star.

It can be difficult to order your units to attack air units.  Yes they will attack them,   but if there is a group of ground units and air units it's too difficult to tell your forces to focus on the air units first.  This could just be me though.  Sometimes I get it to work and other times I just can't do it to save my life.

It would be nice to be able to select all similar units in a group.  For example if I have warriors and archers grouped up and I just want to select all the archers in that group.

The pointer seems off a bit when selecting things.  I feel like my hand has to be pointed down farther then it should to get my aim right.

I've been having so much fun with the full version of this game!  I feel like it's a must have.","Feb 25, 2018 at 2:54 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 17:20:44.168102,makah21,Great throw back in greater depth.,"If I was playing any other game with such horrible disconnect issues, I would of just stopped playing. But I just trudged forward. Game runs great, looks great, plays great. My only other loved rts is COH and AOE from the way back. And this successfully fills that little piece missing in that niche. All of the three are easy to play and tough to master, Ton of replay value with skills as payout instead of drop crates is something that has been long missed, Thank you.!Even with just one solo vs map, and one co-op. I can only imagine the full game being an even greater experience. The only issue I have found since the recent update would be the menu wobbles in the beginning and the wartable will also wobble in the beginning of a match or if you move the table up or down. It is like being on a rocking boat which is not good at all.","Feb 22, 2018 at 2:09 PM",5, 3,

Now that I know what a revolution and pleasure this game really is, I would have paid a large sum of gold for this amazing giant 20x20 feet D&D miniature model table game.

2022-05-28 17:20:47.333636,Bruce_the_Spruce,How I have missed Age of Empires. Hope.,"OK so it is by some of the people who produced age of empires. A good sign as that is arguably the benchmark for RTS. You start off with your base and expand from there. You cannot construct bases anywhere and have designated areas which you must infiltrate. This is a tiny bit of a worry as it does remove some of the freedom. However, for now I am happy to go with it until I have had more experience of 1vs1 or 2vs2. I say more... well I lose connection after about 30 seconds. Just enough to wave to my opponent. I wont mark it down for that as this is surely going to be sorted very soon and besides this is the free version. I am going to buy the full version without doubt and am really hoping for an Age of Empires like experience. 4v4 would be the ultimate for me and I'm sure that will come with time! I like the fact you have 3 types of setup, defensive, balanced or aggressive. It doesn't change that much, but kind of provides an age of empires type civilization choise. Hoping again for this to be expanded in the future.","Feb 20, 2018 at 7:00 AM",5, 2,Thanks for playing and for the review!

Whoever does that the fastest wins. I would very much like for someone to take these controls and graphics and make a strategy game. Like always....the potential is there but this is just not professional. (professional=good enough to pay for). As a free demo this is however great and it shows the potential of VR. But anyone knows that if the gameplay is lacking on a 2d screen making it in vr is not going to fix that. I will play this more when the netcode is fixed and update this review if my opinion changes but i doubt i will buy the full product.
