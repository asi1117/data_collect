2022-05-28 20:40:57.759581,Jadax2,Good stuff!,"It's Zuma, but in VR. I was surprised at how immediately intuitive the controls were and how quickly I adapted to using to hands to fire the diffrent colors off.",Aug 16 at 6:09 AM,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:40:57.774541,uftar,Monte-zooma VR,"This kind of game shines wonderful in VR. One of my preferred puzzle games. I had the free version on Steam and purchased the deluxe version on a Rift sale to have the full environments. Simple, addictive, polished","Mar 21, 2021 at 9:08 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:40:57.789502,Slick1984,A lot of levels and challenging,"The environments are ok. The art style reminds me of ""The Morrigan"".  The game is pretty basic with a couple little twists. I was surprised at how quickly the difficulty ramps up.

I try to make my VR library diverse and this game adds to that diversity.","Oct 7, 2020 at 3:42 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:40:57.804461,mikellyVR,Way better than I thought it might be,"The mechanics work incredibly well in VR. Way better than flat screen versions I've played in the past. Super accurate tracking and great graphics with plenty of scale in VR. Cool environments and I love it when they have the trail of balls wrap around your playspace etc. You can see them in the distance but don't realize how big they are until they are right next to you. 
     It's a great game to chill with in a spinny chair if you want to be done standing for the day haha. (I play on Oculus Quest Wirelessly with virtual Desktop and it works amazingly well) It's also fun (and maybe a bit more immersive?) standing but I usually sit and enjoy. Music is great and catchy while sound effects are satisfying and well done.
     It's a great place to hang out in and chill at the end of the day. It can also be intense depending on the level/difficulty you choose. I've always thought this type of game was ok as a time waster outside of VR but this game really surprised me in VR. 
     I would give it a solid recommendation to anyone that wants a game that is easy to jump into and destress but will still give you a run for your money if you want to brush up on your skills. One of my my most played because it's so easy to jump into and can adapt to my mood.","Jul 11, 2020 at 1:23 AM",5, 9,
2022-05-28 20:41:00.916139,flash-wb,Great game,"Wow, Zooma is one of the best match3 games for VR. Nice graphics, a lot of levels, smooth gameplay. Very fun and addicting.","Jun 26, 2020 at 4:23 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 20:41:00.930101,Puhich,Great experience,I didn’t even think that zooma in VR could be such an interesting idea.,"Jun 26, 2020 at 3:55 PM",5, 6,
