In the trailer it's called Unnamed VR. Now in the store, it's Shelter In Place. Titles can change, but it's usually not a good sign when they are trendy.

The main problem is that while you can certainly explore, the controls are clunky. There are invisible spots you get stuck on. And you don't always turn. And honestly, there isn't much to do. I'd say if you are going to include, say TVs with media players, etc, make them do something. I was disappointed to realize I wouldn't be watching or playing anything. 

And while some rooms such as the shooting gallery have promise, the clunky controls can stop you dead in one place, unable to more or turn. I'm honestly surprised this wasn't free from the start. I'm not trying to crush the dev's hopes and dreams, but this felt like a kitted out Oculus Home more than an app I'd pay for. 

I've seen all in one apps like this before, and most have better navigation, a little music, some nice ambient sounds. I'd say don't give up, just go back in and make it better. The controls need work, they were hit and miss for moving and picking things up. Using the included board to go from area to area often teleported me into furniture with a resounding crash, that obviously needs fixed. 

The idea of a house you can play in is great, just fix the broken areas like archery, which I couldn't even get to fire.","Jul 28, 2020 at 3:19 AM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 18:45:20.168163,Plutonium-239,Terrible,"Ok, let me start saying that the reason why I don't give 1 star is because I got it for free and I feel bad for the developers.

The positives: the physics seems ok. I had fun destrying some teapots and plates. That's it.

- graphics is poor
- Performance is terrible although I have a high end system. 
- I didn't find an option to change locomotion
- the gun range is one of the worst I have ever seen
- archery is simply not good and tracking is all over the place
- the sound is terrible
- simply not fun  

A lot of work is needed to make this game playable in my view.  If you want give it a try, if free. However I would save those GBs of traffic if you have a data cap, if I were you.","Apr 25, 2020 at 5:29 AM",2, 6,
2022-05-28 18:45:20.182126,Satconcook,Generic and clunky,"It is like someone took a bunch of generic models and sound effects and put them all together in a house as they are learning to develop for VR. I’m kind of surprised this is on the Oculus store considering the amount of things I know they have curated out. There are a lot of rooms to explore with some activities and items to push around. However, everything is so clunky and boring. It really feels like this was someone's high school project that they threw together the weekend before it was due.","May 21, 2020 at 12:16 PM",2, 1,
