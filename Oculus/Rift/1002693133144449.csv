2022-05-28 17:45:23.453062,draytalon,Fantastic,"I watched this and was awed by the detail and explanations given on the history of flight. My son also enjoyed the historical presentation of this VR experience, which was a plus in my books. Wished there was more inciteful VR eductional videos out there that i can get him to watch. Short in play time, no interaction but still worth the 5 stars as it was put together brilliantly.","Apr 7, 2021 at 9:03 PM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 17:45:23.467025,KT_Phoenix,Cheers and tears ... fantastic!,"This amazing display of wonderful aircraft brought me to cheers and tears, easily the most emotional experience I have ever had in VR (well, I confess to being an Air Force brat).  Totally wonderful and worth the time and money. I'd pay well for a lot more of this. I can easily see the educational potential as well as the aviation promotional value. I can't wait to share it with my Dad, who is a decorated Vietnam-era Air Force fighter pilot (named Smith, no less). I'd like to see the B-26 bomber, F-100 Super Saber, F4 Phantom, and T-38 Talon. And some cockpit view ride-alongs. So much potential. Thank you very much! Please continue developing this. You do the Service proud.  Blue skies!","Feb 9, 2020 at 11:20 AM",5, 1,

But I've never had the slightest interest in Avaiation until watching this, the fact that it puts you right in the centre of the action is the best decision a developer has ever made, and the voiceover is excellent

This stuff is great, and I want more of it. As other commenters have mentioned, this experience is quite short. One wants to get off the tarmac with the narrator and see more of these spectacular vehicles and their history. If the authors happen to read this, then thank you.

2022-05-28 17:45:29.758199,WhitesideVFX,Great example of a VR icebreaker,"Note: This is not a game, there is no interaction. It's a VR presentation.

This is a nice short experience which asks nothing of the viewer except to be able to turn your head from side to side.
I'm not a big plane nut or anything, but I found the level of detail to be quite striking and realistic.
There were some cool moments, like seeing a visual representation of all the german planes from the battle of britain. And also being able to see a concord flying at top speed.

All in all, it's a simple experience, well excuted. It's free, which makes it even easier to recommend.","Dec 6, 2018 at 7:41 AM",4, 0,

2022-05-28 17:45:32.979582,gjpc,History of war not flight,"This is not the history of flight. It is the United States military's inaccurate history of aircraft mostly used in war,  a humantitarian atrocity. Even when civilian use aircraft are mentioned they are compared to US military aircraft and their long outstanding history is glossed over. A very sick military homage.  
I could not watch the film all the way through.  At the part where an aircraft flies over shooting very large caliber amunition at the observer, presumeably an unarmed civilian I removed my HMD in disgust. I cannot see how this product can be rated Everyone when there is a real life killing scenario.  Now I am looking how to delete an entry in my Oculus library.","Dec 24, 2017 at 12:28 AM",1, 9,"Hi thank you for your feedback! The Everyone rating was updated to E10+ to reflect the inclusion of the Fokker Eindecker shooting sequence. There is only one American military aircraft in the experience, which is the F22 at the end, and there are only two featured military aircraft in the piece, if you include the German Fokker Eindecker (the French Bleriot and American DC-3/C-47 were used by the military but neither aircraft was armed). The WWII flyover sequence obviously also includes British and German warplanes but we intended it to be contextualized as an antiwar sentiment since it is supposed to show the scale of the destruction to the crewmen rather than as a celebration of the Battle of Britain. The remaining aircraft are all civilian and include the French-British Concorde and the Ukrainian Mriya heavy transport craft which is often used for humanitarian disaster relief missions."

But the  biggest isssue I had was everything from the narrator to the content was trying to make the impression that America is the only county worth mentioning when it comes to aviation.

He will be your guide to all things flight, from the first to the biggest. We get to see the Wright Flyer, DC3 and even the F22 Raptor fighter jet puts in an appearance!

Of course, it is not all about just the planes here, but the stories and the history behind them. Full voice narrated it was more like the greatest airshow ever devised than a simple VR experience. The sounds, the sights and dare I say even the feel of these planes flying over you is something truly incredible. It's is not just a great VR experience, it is also a good educational tool for any class or individual learning about flights. Once again VR shows it’s strength when it comes to educational experiences and this is one of the very best of those experiences.","May 20, 2017 at 11:53 PM",4, 1,

It would be fun to do country specific versions of this to celebrate the achievements of different aviation communities. The jet age is a little fuzzy, there are also good arguments for starting with the He178 or Me 262, since they were turbojets with practical performance but I thought there were enough Nazi-era planes in there from the Battle of Britain sequence. I think the 707 was a good starting point because that's the plane that brought jet aviation to the general public (you could argue for the Comet too, but it didn't have the same impact because of the early crashes scaring off buyers)."
