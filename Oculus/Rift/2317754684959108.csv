Meteor Crater Arizona?

Thanks for the experience Fellas.
Excellent Project.

Any plans to extend it?


I would suggest, a few little interface options.

1).  Menu Button - options, settings, and end/exit
2).  Possible to add a Location map?
3).  Seperate Volume levels for
      a). Voice,
      b). Music,
      c). Ambient.
4).  Perhaps some video tweeking options.

Very well done!

I do not hesitate to recommend this!","Dec 12, 2019 at 11:11 PM",5, 1,

Update the flight controls. It's great being able to fly, but having to stop to change direction was a bit disappointing. If that aspect can't be changed, could an option be added to disable the blue text? It really gets in the way of all your hard work and pops up every single time.

Option to turn off the narration. I loved getting to hear about the Horseshoe Bend, but it would be nice to be able to turn off the tour part for future use and just enjoy the scenery. You also might consider a voiceover artist. 

You did a really good job yourselves, but you don't need to try to do everything on your own. A voice artist can pick up the load and could be implemented into the app. You might even consider someone local to the area to share insights or lore. 

Overall it was a really enjoyable app, though updating to touch controls would let more people play. As of now they need the old remote control or an x-box controller. For people on the fence about purchasing I enjoyed the tour for about an hour. 

You are in a fixed point in any place you zipline to, but you can turn around using your remote or gamepad.","Jul 8, 2019 at 10:46 AM",3, 2,
