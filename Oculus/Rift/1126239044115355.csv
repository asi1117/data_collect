It does have single player, so you can play against the AI.  The problem is that the AI just isn't a whole lot of fun to play around with.  Although, you can definitely improve your gameplay and try out different things.  You do level up as you play against the AI, so that's good.  The reason I only give it 3 stars is twofold and part of the same problem.  In the approximately 30 minutes I tried out this game, I didn't get a match on a Sunday afternoon.  So it will probably be difficult to get matches going unless you have a friend to play against.  The reason I say it's a twofold problem is because the single player is just practice mode, with no story.  But at least you can practice while you're waiting for an online match.  The bad news is that the game crashed on me once during practice.  However, the gameplay itself is pretty exciting.  You can attack your enemy directly or attack 3rd party enemies to try to gain powerups.  So there's definitely a game going on on how fast you can get powerups versus attacking your enemy.  There is no way to evade attacks or move, but you can get defensive powerups, like a shield.  So this game is perfect for sitting down, 2 sensor setup, which is nice.  Just really needs more players and a better 'full' single player experience in the meantime.","Nov 27, 2017 at 6:08 AM",3, 4,
