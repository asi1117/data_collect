2022-05-28 18:49:14.136382,FullmetalTanman,Terrible Game,"I’m not typically the type to bother writing a review, but this game upset me beyond belief within the first 2 minutes of opening. First off the music is WAY too loud, you can’t even hear yourself think; let alone being able to hear anyone in an oculus party with you, and there are NO AUDIO OPTIONS AT ALL to fix this. The “multiplayer” aspect is also BS, you can’t join a game with friends, you either have to have your own server, or you both have to search for an online game at the same time and hope for the best. Also the game mechanics themselves are horribly optimized and very static, I would give this 0 stars if I could. Not even worth the 99¢.","May 10, 2019 at 4:21 AM",1, 13,
