2022-05-28 19:39:53.344446,sket4,Funny app for kids,"Can't tear off my child :) We liked the opportunity to equip the room and paint on the wall)) additional paintbooks are bought separately.. One minus - it's not very clear how to play, at first, but then figured out .. I think developers should pay attention to it .. and so, in overall, very good) add more paintbooks please!)","Feb 26, 2018 at 4:31 AM",5, 5,
2022-05-28 19:39:53.359406,Aquavemo,Just ... Weird,"Double tap A to move. (But tell no one about it!) Follow the dragon from the unity asset store and then listen to some strange meditative stories in between. Bonus: one of the most confusing title/loading screen i have ever seen // Yes, you need definitely a tutorial. Surprising, i know ;)","Feb 10, 2018 at 4:04 AM",2, 8,"Hello :-) Thanks for feedback and we can see the need to make a tutorial!
Yes, we love the dedicated hearts and minds in Unity ;-)"
2022-05-28 19:39:53.375363,FastLawyer,Too frustrating currently,"I could never figure out how to use the motion controllers.  I was able to use the Oculus Remote, but movement was very difficult.  I finally figured out that if you look down while pressing down and possibly forward on your remote, then you will teleport to the spot.  Everything is controlled by gaze operation.  The story I was able to unlock was well narrated, but it was just a simple Universe VR environment with audio.  Needs more work if they want to make this app good for children to enjoy.","Feb 8, 2018 at 11:15 AM",2, 1,"This might be more helpful :-) Currently you can use the oculus remote controller and oculus touch together, or just Oculus remote but only for current levels 1-3. In this update  it is made easier to control - by using only oculus touch without need of using Remote."
