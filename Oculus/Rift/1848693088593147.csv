Modulia Studio has been updated to work with Live 11.
Thanks for your patience"
2022-05-28 19:10:53.306567,djcannonball,demo = mood-kill,"i had some trouble setting it up voor Live. once i got it working  there was no time left to try any other module. i see really pontential in this app, but the 30sec demo time is a REAL MOOD-KILL.  i didn't even get 1 second to test it out. restarting the app doesn't give me any more seconds to test. i had some more time  perhaps i would buy some modules,  now i can't even determine if it's useful for me or not","Jun 2, 2020 at 6:06 PM",2, 2,"Hi djcannonball,

Thanks for your comment. I understand the frustration caused by the short demo time so we have increased it to 20 minutes (per day) in the latest update. Also, it now only takes the time your are inside VR into account, so you can set it up peacefully.

I hope you will give the app another try! :)"

Do you still have the issue with the latest update? If so, I'd be interested in knowing more about it so do not hesitate to get in touch at contact@modulia-studio.com"
2022-05-28 19:10:53.339479,SchwaZilla,Not that impressed,"The central idea is kind of neat, but after 30 seconds you have to pay to us3e just about everything, after hhaving already paid for the app. Plus there doesn't seem to be any instructions on how to get anything working in the Virtual space, just how to hook up live, and some of us don't have live, nor do we particularly want live.","Feb 20, 2020 at 10:50 PM",2, 3,"Hi SchwaZilla,

Thanks for your feedback. Do not hesitate to check the latest version, demo time has been increased to 20 minutes per day!
You can also take a look at our youtube channel, it has some tutorials and demonstrations to help you make the most of the app: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfmSlBYYUnOp8ZhXi2bkm9mIFdqp6SNkN"
2022-05-28 19:10:53.355436,HerbertWraczlavski,Potentionally groundbraking,"This app is simply amazing. The ability to control 6 CCs at the same time with Cube controller is priceless. I was little surprised though, that the devs completely omited the option to map CCs to analog joystics of Oculus Touch. It seems so obvious, yet I wasn´t able to figure out how to do it. I think I am not alone who´d appreciate implementation of such feature, as that would allow to control not just 6 CCs, but 10!","Sep 27, 2019 at 7:31 AM",4, 3,"Hi Herbert, really happy to know that you enjoy Modulia Studio and especially our modulation tools!
We've been focusing on movement-based modulation but adding the option to map CCs to Oculus Touch controls is on our todo list. Stay tuned! :)"
2022-05-28 19:10:56.492047,Sweetscent,THIS IS FUN!,Can't believe this is free.  I installed and set this up in less than 5 minutes and it just worked with my DAW(Reason).  It is fun!  You can set it up the different instruments wherever is comfortable and use the virtual desktop to access your DAW controls.  It makes you make beats and choices that are unique to it and so your sounds end up being something unique.  It's more of a new instrument as oppesed to an app.,"May 17, 2019 at 6:34 AM",5, 4,"Hi Sweetscent,
Thanks for your comment. We're glad to have a Reason user here and we're really happy to know that you enjoy using Modulia Studio with it!
Do not hesitate to join the Discord or to get in touch through any other social network. As we are in early access, we'd be really interested in discussing with you about your use of this new instrument :)"
2022-05-28 19:10:56.507006,MagBeatz,Definitely gonna use it again!,"This app is absolutly great!! I've connected it with my Ableton Live and it works perfectly! I could play and record all my VSTs without any noticeable latency. Being able to save and load your custom music sets is game-changing!
I just think there could be more tools and instruments, I'd love to have a mixing console for example…
If you're a music producer interested in VR I think it's a must-have and if you're a beginner it may be a cool way to learn music production!","Apr 30, 2019 at 3:07 AM",5, 7,"Hi MagBeatz,

Thanks for your comment. Really glad you like Modulia Studio!!
More modules will come in the future and mixing is one of our focus point so stay tuned ;)"
