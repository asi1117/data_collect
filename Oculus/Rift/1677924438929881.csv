To be fair to the creator, it's technically superior to the Deadmau5 Absolut Vodka VR ""game"", but it's just incohesive and makes no sense.  You start lying in bed, your room explodes, your dog gets sucked out of the window, and you start an ""experience"" of a couple of minutes in length.  Including a poorly animated scene of some super hero woman destroying robots.  At the end you are given some crap about AI taking over the world.  Well if this experience is anything to go by, we don't have anything to fear.  At least the Deadmau5 Vodka junk was free.  You don't have to charge for everything you make btw ;)

Update:  LMAO!  Awww, if this took 5 people, you need to try a new career.  Trust me, this is awful.  And if you think that Stephen Hawkings or Elon Musks talk was about super hero space women and robot dogs, you need to listen to it again.   I give every thing I try on here an honest review, this was my honest review, your response to my review is sad.","Nov 8, 2018 at 1:54 PM",1, 11,"Hi Firkinfedup,

You can contact Gillian (the producer of AI Nightmare) at gillian@milovr.com for a Full Refund but I have to let you know, your review of AI Nightmare is very unfair. 

It was inspired by Stephen Hawking’s speech that AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a big threat to the entire human race. We want to warn the world to keep AI under control. It took our team of 5 people 4 months (from brainstorming, storyboard, 3D modeling, animation, CGI, post-production and distribution) to create this 8 mins animation movie. “AI Nightmare” was officially selected by Mammoth Film Festival, Capital City Film Festival, New Media Film Festival and DTLA Film Festival ... Awarded Honorable Mention from indieTORONTO Film Festival and Won “Best Experimental Animation Award” from Mediterranean Film Festival Cannes. 

It is not easy for all VR Developers to keep their passion in the current tough environment in VR industry.  It will be sweet if users can appreciate their hard work just a little bit more..."
