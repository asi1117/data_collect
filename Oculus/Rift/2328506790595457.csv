Horrible company, I'll never buy any more of their products. 6 other companies were happy to provide me with a key for the same circumstances.",7 days ago,1, 0,"The MetaQuest store is cross-buy so if you own both a Rift and Quest, you won’t have to re-purchase the game.

2022-05-28 20:56:16.271890,Zispin,Exactly what I wanted from VR MiniGolf,"I played some MiniGolf in VR Chat and wanted more of that and this just takes that experience and makes it everything I wanted!
I can play alone or with friends and both experiences are great!
8 Courses each with a hard mode makes for essentially 16 courses to try in the base game alone. Each has its own theme and mechanic that each hole is based around.
You can find ""Lost Balls"" in each normal mode course each can be used as your ball in all courses from then on. Each hard mode version has a treasure hunt of sorts that leads you to bonus putter that again can be used in the future.
Just hunting for these extra bits is fun on its own!
The Start up menu/area alone is amazing!
Once I run out of things on the base courses I am definitely buying all 3 extra courses! (6 if you count the hard mode that comes with them.",24 days ago,5, 0,
2022-05-28 20:56:16.287847,WhyKlef,Wow. Just wow.,"This game is to mini-putt what Eleven Table Tennis is to ping pong and then some, this game goes beyond with the sheer amount of courses, customization, breathtaking decors.

The physics are extremely true to life. There are balls to find hidden throughout every course, the courses are different, no 2 holes feel the same, some have clever mechanics to potentially create endgame turnarounds a la Mario Party, of course if you manage a nearly impossible trickshot.

Like... Honestly, this game is perfect. And this is what I mean with this being the ETT of mini-putt. If you've played ETT, you know that you don't / won't ever need another ping pong game. This game is extremely affordable, has tremendous replayability AND is still actively supported? PLUS CROSSBUY...

No need to think twice, buy it and dare I say, you most likely will never need another VR mini-putt after this one. It's that amazing. Great job devs!

Edit: Just had an idea cross my mind. Down the development road, one thing that would be cool is a ""Gauntlet 9 / 18 (Easy/Hard/Any)"" mode where the game randomly selects holes amongst every single holes unlocked. It would most likely cause a bit of loading between holes but still, it'd create a very custom experience!",Jan 28 at 9:14 PM,5, 20,

2022-05-28 20:56:16.317768,Foxxii96,A real feeling VR mini golf game...,Walkabout mini golf is the best minigolf/golf game avaliable! Beautiful environments twinned with the real feel of the hit of the ball mixed with the ability to find 'lost balls' really adds to the feel of the game.

2022-05-28 20:56:19.422463,transplintersaurus,Fantastic,"The game is Fantastic!  The physics are spot on.   This game doesn't need super hi-res graphics to be an A++ game.  Low poly makes it even more fun actually.  It's an awesome game to show off what fun VR can really be.  I play with family scattered in the US, and it's a great way just to hang out and talk, play a little golf in the process, and just spend a couple of hours relaxing.   Since the game already sells for a great price , I'd be willing to pay a few more dollars if the dev added DLC, another set of holes perhaps.   The update of the scavenger hunt was cool.  I play the holes again with family, and it makes the game new again.    Great job on that update.   Young and old, this is an awesome game to have in everyone's library.   Keep up the great work......

 PS:  please work to get it in Steam since I have friends that don't do Oculus, and I'm anxious for them to download it on their headsets.   😊. Thanks.   

   

Ok, another new review.     These guys are awesome.  Just added Another Course.     I bought it with 5  I believe,  now there's 8.   This is one of the best games I have for VR.    Again I can't say enough great things about the developer...    😎


I loaded up to play tonight, and I see there are 2 new courses.   The devs are charging a small fee now.    You know, that's ok.    I bought with 5 like I stated earlier, they added 3 more at no charge, which was awesome.   A small price now is ok.   The game is that good where I'm willing to pay a little bit, if that means they'll keep improving it.    I'm a fan, keep up the good work !!!",Dec 19 at 5:36 PM,5, 9,

Cool atmosphere, great view and a exotic getaway! I just have one thing. The frog sound on the night stage.. too intense and too much for my taste.

2022-05-28 20:56:22.627890,Gemini000,Extremely Good; Couple Suggestions,"This game is arguably better than REAL mini-golf! No waiting on people ahead of you, putter auto-sizes, TONS of ball choices (once found), but I do have a couple very minor nitpicks which kinda serve as suggestions for future improvements. 1: It's weird to me to not have both hands active at the same time, as I'm used to porting with my left hand and rotating with my right. A feature where you can enable both hands simultaneously and simply assign the putter permanently to left or right would be nice. 2: A few holes with water hazards had me hitting stroke limits constantly as they depend on SUPER-precise shots. Even the holes with verticality are easier! I would suggest adding a feature where if the ball goes into a water hazard, the game drops an arrow in the last safe spot the ball was in before entering the water and asking if you wish to do a drop for a one-stroke penalty, or reset the ball for no penalty. This would definitely ease the frustration on those precision-requiring holes!",Oct 20 at 12:46 PM,5, 11,

We've been having connectivity issues to the Oculus servers on PC. I believe we have a fix in beta (we just keep pinging the server until it finally responds) that should roll out soon.

Easy courses can be beat fast but the hard ones are more fun. The ball collecting side game is a nice touch! Multiplayer is a lot of fun too!

Don't even really need a tutorial in this game as their nothing special about hitting the ball, you just start playing and your fine.

-good consistent physics
-easy social multiplayer experience
-fun interesting courses 
This is the FIRST game to finally deliver on these, and I have tried many on steam and Oculus store.   Why did it take so long for something seemingly so basic and decent to come to us?  Who knows, but its here now and Ive been getting all my friends with VR to buy this game ASAP so we can play together.  I'm hooked and its well worth the low price entry!

2022-05-28 20:56:32.095567,RoEKoN,"Very, very, very good.","This was one of the first apps I bought this past month when I bought a Quest 2. This game has so many good things going for it: 

1. It's very immersive even with the cartoonish graphics
2. The sounds and environments are great
3. No stinky hot air/no annoying families/no bug bites
4. ""God Mode"" or looking over the course is very cool
5. Teleportation or smooth motion with speed adjustments
6. ""Lost balls"" on every course which gives players more to do with a solid excuse to check out the environments
7. You only need to use one controller
8. Great amount of content considering the price
9. Simple and beautiful enough for anyone

My expectations were 100% met by playing singleplayer. However, my little bro just picked up a Quest 2 and I bought him this so we could play together. Co-op in this game is everything I wanted and more. It's amazing. Him and I haven't had so much fun with so much laughing in years. My little bro trying to putt one in but I can see his head bobbing up and down from laughing so hard while I'm laying down trying to block his shot with my head yelling ""You Jack@*s!"", or getting down by my near-missed shot saying ""Why won't you go home ball, are you too good for your home?!"".

I would like to request a minor change if I may. How hard would it be to add a ""start over"" button to the scorecard in the course preview screen? When I am really trying to master one of the new courses I like to play it over and over. A player always has to exit to the main menu and choose the game again to start over.

Had plans to play some real minigolf today and it started raining. Decided to pick this up to get my fix and it did not disappoint. Physics feel great and courses feel realistic rather than over the top with gimmicks. 

Would like to have a total simulation mode where the clubs and balls are physical objects that you need to pick up and place and you'd have a physical score card you could write your strokes. Would make some carnage while playing with friends.

Definitely needs an option for smooth locomotion as well. Not a fan of forced teleport.

The environments are beautiful even with simple graphics. The pace of the gameplay can be as fast as you want, or take your time to chat in multi-player. Physics are satisfyingly realistic.

The latest update with ability to fly the course is genius and allows you to get the unique vantage point you want, or to visit the mountain peak towering above you. I like the new music on most of the courses. If I want to just enjoy the environmental sounds it's easy to turn the music down to zero in setting. Definitely recommend picking up the game.

1.) Easy as pie multiplayer setup. If you're like my family, you can use 1 Oculus account across multiple devices.
2.) Gameplay is near identical to real life as far as I can tell. The physics of everything felt very accurate.  I never once thought the game control 'cheated' me.
3.) The maps are nice to walk around with lots of play variety.
4.) There's a little 'find the balls' side game built into every map, which kept the kids entertained between turns.

2022-05-28 20:56:44.735759,Kinetic_Ken,A clear winner!,"TL;DR summary:  Amazing game, you are wrong if you're on the fence about buying this!  My brother and I logged in an insane amount of hours since we bought it.  It's almost become a nighttime ritual (which has been making waking up for work the next day very hard!!) 

Now for the lengthy review:
In many ways, mini golf speaks for itself.  This game takes everything that makes mini golf great and keeps on going!  The courses are incredibly fun and are a blend of normal-realistic as well as some courses only possible in a world where there's no threat of suing because someone slipped and fell to their death, haha!  ...oh yeah, and courses where you are also walking around with a bucket of balls always at the ready (for when you keep missing and knock them over the side of a mountain).  The physics are solid and they thought through a lot of smaller things also, like the ability to half to hold down the trigger to hit the ball (accidental ball hits are a real thing!).   

Big kudos for the fifth course (gothic castle)!!  What a beautiful course!  And points for being able to tie it into two holidays.  (The Castle on Hard is the Christmas course)

Suggestions for updates (as of 12/24)

There's a few suggestions I'll add or things I wish were different, but I'm going to preface this by saying that nothing I'm about to say comes close to taking off a star for this game.  It is throughly enjoyable and a clear winner.

When teleporting, I wish my character would land right on the circle I say to teleport to, instead of to the side.  I also wish the auto-teleport could adjust for the courses where that throws you into a mountain or floating over a cliff.

Lastly, I wish there was a way to prevent having to hit through a wall/embankment, and that there was a way to move the ball out the length of the club when you land right against something that prevents you from swinging.

Oh, and we need a course with a windmill and something that opens/closes. that's classic mini golf!","Dec 25, 2020 at 1:11 AM",5, 19,

2022-05-28 20:56:47.880349,LociInTheSky,Walkabout is SO good,"It's probably more accurate to say that there are 10 courses than 5.  The nighttime versions of the courses have similar holes as the daytime, but all of them are changed to be more difficult.  This game was released with 3 courses.   Now there are five, and very soon, there will be a sixth.  The devs are active and busy, and I suspect there'll be yet another one down the line at least, along with various other definite features I've been told about by the devs themselves.  I've been playing VR for years, and this is the best value I've gotten out of any game.
The more you play these courses, the better you learn how to handle playing each hole.  The replayability here is significant.

Also, this game is noob-proof and idiot-proof.  Anyone can play this right away and get the full experience.","Feb 7, 2021 at 7:33 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:56:50.997013,Atoner,Great game - but,"The game needs an Honour system.  So many players quit just because you get ahead by one stroke, and it's really frustrating to not get to finish.  How about Gold for players who honour a higher number of full games played (whether they win or lose,) silver for the runners who bail when it goes balls up, etc, and so on..   And in order to play in that Honour level, you have to keep your Honour to each match  Just a thought.  Rest of the game makes it worth the money I spent on the headset!!  My Go-to game!

2022-05-28 20:56:57.344036,not_mike,Yup this is the one you are looking for.,"Having tried the other VR mini golf iterations I've been left annoyed by the lack of realism when it comes to level design and club feel. When I play mini golf in the real world, I expect practical holes that can be accomplished in 1-3 strokes, with most all being ""hole-in-one-able"" while having a vibrant/fun setting. 

This game hits the nail on the head.

The level design is superb. The holes are the perfect balance of realism and fantasy all while placing you in a vibrant walkable, connected course. None of the holes feel too 'arcadey', and there are 0 gimmicks. The putting feels SO good and the physics really shine. 

This is the mini golf game you have always wanted for VR and I'm excited to see what future courses and updates are added to the game!

Hopes and suggestions for future updates: 
-smooth locomotion and turning
-more interactivity with scenery, world objects to play with
-trigger events for doing certain paths/putts
-more courses!
-in-game tournament mode/comp play/ranked
-more unlockable golf balls for completing daily objectives or tasks
-ability to throw golf club (lol)
-custom club designs
-custom character heads/models
-daily leaderboards
-record of all hole-in-ones and/or items/balls for getting hole-in-ones","Oct 23, 2020 at 11:39 AM",5, 15,
2022-05-28 20:56:57.359994,Scoth42,Great minigolf game with a couple issues,"Overall it's great. I've had a ton of fun with friends with this game. The graphics are fun, the locales are enjoyable, and the courses range from trivial to a bit frustrating until you learn the tricks, then they're fun.

The main issue we have is how easy it is to get kicked from the game, at least on Quest 2. It seems like someone can't take their headset off for even a single minute without getting disconnected. We've all tweaked our Quest-level sleep settings to multiple minutes and still we'll lose connection to the game in less than a minute to run to the bathroom or something. This is really the only major issue - we've had to restart so many times because someone went to get a drink and it drops them in a minute.","Nov 16, 2020 at 11:05 AM",4, 4,"Hey sorry for the slow reply, all of these should be fixed now, it will still disconnect when the headset sleeps but prompt you to rejoin when it wakes back up."

2022-05-28 20:57:03.683082,Safety_Moose,Great game with great potential,"As it is its a very very good minigolf game for VR. The putting feels incredibly natural, and the only flaw ive noticed is that if the ball comes to a slow roll, it stops before it probably would in real life, as if the game freezes it at a certain minimum speed rather then when it stops, if that makes any sense. This isnt much of an issue unless it stops right at the edge of the cup, which happend more often than it should have. 

I hope this game gets more courses through updates. The courses included are well worth the current price, but theyn will eventually get old, and my friends and I enjoy the multiplayer, so I wouldnt want to reach a point where we dont play it again. 

With the simulation and mechanics being so smooth, it would be great to have a custom course editor, but obviously thats a big ask. Howevere it would be amazing within this framework and guarentee infinite replayability.","Oct 9, 2020 at 9:18 AM",5, 8,"Thanks!

The Physics are great and the graphics just right. Our Headsets are 2 x Rift S, 1 Quest and 1 Quest 2 and all of us can play together in a private room with no issues with Crossplay. My only comment for improvement would be to add a course designer so that other users can add their own content, because the 6 courses are fine, but your left itching for more courses.

Pavlov, Elite Dangerous (was hooked on that as I played Elite in the 1980s on a Commodore 64), Star Wars Squadrons etc etc. I recently bought this and my brother and his son and wife played a couple rounds. This is hands down the best VR game I've ever played. The  mini golf maps are crazy good. The physics is spot on! The audio in game just works (and 3 people were on the Quest 2 Wireless and I was on the Rift S).  This game is crazy good! I was also super impressed when, after 9 holes, my brother logged off as he thought we were quitting. We kept playing and got a few holes ahead. He joined back up and the game was smart enough to just let him catch up! Very well written! My only complaint, and it is not really a complaint, is that I wish you could just buy more courses. It is so good that I literally would love to give the developers more money! I'd gladly pay $5 per course for new courses! (just to be clear.. you can unlock extra courses within game for free!)
