2022-05-28 19:44:20.911968,KreekoANDTom393,Add options.,Add the option for head-orientated movement and boom you have a better game. I remember playing the original version of this game fondly back on the DK2 and I wanted to enjoy the new version but the controls are god awful.,"Jul 8, 2020 at 12:27 AM",2, 1,
2022-05-28 19:44:20.931914,Dakronic1981,No good,"Was good cpncept and noce ild style graphics  but controls have be worst there no options to change this 

Rift s has cable so  doing 360s all  time winds you in knots

So  why you  cannot move camera with right stick  on  smooth not crappy snappy 

Also there no strafe or side step  becomes.right burden trying turn as you need aim head and change.control stick direction every point 

I  want refund but dunno how","Jan 16, 2020 at 6:11 PM",1, 2,"thanks for comment and for the feedback. I'm sorry to hear all those problems. You're right, i should include some more control options, probably in a future update. Anyway you can strafe moving the controller to the left/right while walking, and can rotate (snap) with sticks, so you don't need to play in 360. If you want to ask for a refund the easiest way is from the Oculus mobile app. Thanks again."

2022-05-28 19:44:20.963829,GreenSquid772,,"This was an interesting experience. The gameplay is fairly simple, but I found the atmosphere and level design quite unique. It seems to be paying homage to 90s and early 2000s FPS games (Doom, Quake, Blood etc), so everything has this abstract, ominous, oppressive feel to it. It’s not exactly a horror game but definitely feels tense, bizarre and off-kilter. There’s also an Aliens-inspired bonus level, which I thought was quite neat.","Sep 3, 2019 at 6:47 PM",4, 6,
