2022-05-28 18:26:12.621929,Ysetech,Not perfect but quite good,"As a fan of Doctor who, I really wanted to live this experience even if I was afraid to be disappointted. And actually, it was a good surprise for me. 
First I enjoy to live the generic ! A real please to live inside it :) 
Then (spoiler ahead) : 
..
...
angels was very scary as usual ! 
Daleks are idiot, be inside a dalek was a great idea and it was really well done

Finally history was ok, even if I regret there is no french voices because sub-titles break the immersion and are sometimes to quickly displayed, especially when the doctor and another people talk quite in the same time...

To conclude, even if there is some technicals fails, as a fan, I recommend this game ;)",Apr 4 at 12:26 AM,4, 6,
2022-05-28 18:26:12.637887,Chris_M1014,"Good experience, but...","I feel like for £16 this game is way too short. Mechanics with sonic screwdriver and puzzles are good, but is let down with the loading every 5 seconds. The large proportion of loading time to game time really ruins immersion. not to mention TARDIS grows in size when you're loaded 'into the world' as opposed to 'in the TARDIS'. Also, I wish we could have some more input on the TARDIS, I wanted to actually fly the thing, not just pull the lever and instantaneously land exactly where I was supposed to be. Not worth the price IMO, but if you're willing to pay it for the short ~2 1/2 hour experience, It's okay.",Mar 7 at 12:43 AM,3, 13,
2022-05-28 18:26:12.652846,RennyRenster,It's great. But...,"I really enjoyed this game, the story is gripping and the visuals are fantastic. The game is quite good but I do have some cons to say about it... When stuck on a puzzle the game gives barely any hints on what to do besides a voice line that will be repeated and drilled into your head. Then I feel as if the game ends too early, but the dev team is small so I do understand that...

Now... I have seen the dev team respond to many a review so if one of the devs see this... I have a simple question. Where is Time Lord Victorious? Its availability on the Oculus Quest but not on the Oculus Rift S baffles me. I'm genuinely confused on why Time Lord Victorious is innaccessable to people with the Oculus Rift S. If you guys are working on a way to make the Oculus Rift S compatible with the Time Lord Victorious, please tell me so. As I would love for the DLC to arrive as soon as possible.

Thanks!",Oct 18 at 6:46 PM,4, 63,
2022-05-28 18:26:12.667806,Xaentrick,"Wonderful, but surprisingly short.","The game itself is wonderful and full of suspense. When you first get the sonic screwdriver and have to pick the lock by twisting and turning it so that the lock pops open is beautiful. Along with how some of the sections and puzzles are wonderful. The section with the angels is tense and makes you keep an eye out in all directions for what could be lurking about. I would highly recommend it for any Doctor Who fan.

There are just a few things that could have been better. It is a wonderful concept and the game kept me entertained and pleased. Though it feels like a let down in later parts. Instead of using the sonic to open door and sabatoge panels by doing some little twisting and turning like that first lock. It is just point, click, open. It feels like this is just a teaser for a much larger game that is in development. One that could be absolutly amazing given the rich history of Doctor Who. It is a good game,  it does is leave me wanting more which is not a bad thing. As I love the Doctor Who series and think a VR title could do amazing things. I beleive if given the time to work out small things and create a wider story based on not just the horror elements but also the more wild and whacky things from the universe. Then they could have a truly amazing game on hand.","Jan 12, 2021 at 5:36 PM",3, 90,
2022-05-28 18:26:12.683763,Barple,It's okay at its best,"The game's not particularly anything really noteworthy apart it from being the first Doctor Who game for VR out there, and the game's really only for fans of the show. Subtle references and a bit of fanservice, but that's about it. The puzzles are pretty easy and the game is rather quick to finish so there's not much replay value here. The ""hints"" given by The Doctor and Emma repeat an annoying amount of times, hardly giving you a quiet moment to think and keep rushing your objective. The bit where you ""fly"" the TARDIS and flip a few controls is a bit aggrivating and not very to-the-point as it looks to be in the show, but the TARDIS is pretty cool to be in. The most disappointing thing about the game is the lack of the Timelords Victorious DLC only seen in Quest and PSVR versions of the game, so don't expect that to be in here as of Feb. 17/ 21.

tl;dr Not exactly worth getting unless you're a fan of Doctor Who and especially of The 13th Doctor.","Feb 18, 2021 at 3:21 AM",3, 18,

2022-05-28 18:26:15.824363,kf2010,Mixed bag-- literally.,"This game is average. I say it is a mixed bag because it seems to be a hodge podge of horror, shooting, puzzles. That is not necessarily bad, but when the ""backbone"" that connects these mixed genres are flimsy at best, then it becomes a mediocre game. I had high hopes for this, but I was not fully impressed. Even the ending is drawn out and anti-climatic.

Don't get me wrong, it is not bad per se. It is just mediocre. I will play it again though just to see the full graphics on the PCVR version. The Quest 1/2 standalone version had, also, mediocre graphics as well.","Dec 5, 2020 at 7:32 AM",3, 11,
2022-05-28 18:26:15.839323,treeml,"Yeah it's simple, but it's also so fun.","Anyone who grew up with Dr Who, stepping into the tardis is just fantastic. The voice acting is great (and you get the real actor). Yes it's stupidly easy, but it's more like a Dr experince than a game. This is one of the most emotionally invoking experinces I have had (probably because I grew up with Dr who and much of it was like a childhood dream coming true). For the price it's a great ride. 

I hope they make more.","Sep 30, 2020 at 7:48 AM",5, 40,

I twist and turn the knobs and it just breaks. Ive heard ' Have another go' about 500 times now. Given up.,"Sep 27, 2020 at 4:43 PM",1, 11,
2022-05-28 18:26:15.868246,AshDargon,Great (If you're a Doctor Who fan),"So the game is a great time if you already love Doctor Who purely because seeing well known villains such as the weeping angels and daleks in VR is spectacular. The price, puzzles and length, not so much. The game is about 2 hours long which is incredibly short for £16 and the puzzles aren't very hard at all (especially the ""puzzle"" in the weeping angel basement which boils down to cranking a lever for a bit). 

I wholeheartedly recommend this game to any Doctor Who fan though if you have no interest or just dislike the show then you should definitely wait for a hefty sale.","Jul 17, 2020 at 6:24 AM",4, 41,
2022-05-28 18:26:19.009843,DeviantSpider,The best Doctor Who game ever made,"Although if you've been a fan of Doctor Who for a while, you can appreciate how incredibly low that bar is set. Fun story, reasonably polished gameplay, and lots of great visuals. This game would stand up whether or not you care for Doctor Who. 

There are only one or two problem areas, where the puzzle design is so weird and unintuitive that it feels like a flashback to the worst of Sierra days. They seem to have realised that this was a problem, because the character in your ear immediately tells you how to solve the ""puzzle"". 

Great on both PC and Quest. Really impressed with how they managed to make it look and run on the Quest, but it is delicious on the PC. Being able to step into the Tardis is an absolute treat.","Jul 29, 2020 at 1:06 PM",4, 15,

2022-05-28 18:26:19.041758,Chazmeister,A some what mediocre VR experience.,"It's... OK, I think pretty much sums up this game. Had it come out a few years back in the early days of the CV1 it would have been a reasonable experience. Now some years later, it's just a passable one.

For one the graphics are a little on the basic side, but I'm assuming that's due to it getting a Quest port too. However it still remains that on PC it looks dated graphically. That's not to say it looks terrible and it has its moments in places. The huge scale of the temple entrance being quite impressive. On the flip side your hands are just awful. Why couldn't they use something like the Oculus Home hands. The overall impression, is that it all looks a bit rough.

Some of the puzzle elements are poorly telegraphed as to what the game expects you to do and the constant nagging voice prompts for the puzzles are for the most part, rather ironically, not much help at all and only serve to frustrate and iritate. So the only time I really got stuck on the puzzles was due to their poor design. Otherwise they were all pretty simple and straight forward.

It's not all bad though, as the sound design and the voice acting are top notch. Some of the locations were genuinely creepy because of that, despite the rudimentary graphics. Overall the whole atmosphere of the game was good too.

Would recommend it? Only if you're a big Dr Who fan, but otherwise not really. For the price point, it's just too short (about 1.5 hours) and there's just much better quality VR experiences to be had for that money. It just feels too much like a slightly clunky feet finding first time effort you'd have expected 3 or more years ago, but not these days.","May 30, 2020 at 10:13 PM",3, 2,
2022-05-28 18:26:19.056718,Xenomurphy,Amazing Doctor Who Game with some flaws,"+++ This review contains some minor spoilers +++

As a huge Doctor Who fan, I must say I love this little game, well, most of it. I played it with an Oculus Rift and a GTX 970 and it ran smoothly without any bugs.

POSITIVE:
+ I could finally ""visit"" the TARDIS!
+ Daleks!
+ Good voice acting
+ Fantastic soundtrack (especially the nod to 'Alien')
+ Impressive and immersive sets
+ Interesting locations

NEUTRAL:
o You move somewhat slowly
o The story is a bit too much on the woke side
o Hints come too quick and are repeated too frequent (this is VR and I want to explore the settings in peace, hahaha)
o Puzzles were standard and not too difficult

NEGATIVE:
- You can't adjust the dialogue volume independent from the music volume and sound effect volume (the dialogue is sometimes hard to understand).
- The age rating!

This is my main point of criticism. An age rating of 6 years? This is in most parts a horror game. And a VR game, which means it is more immersive than pancake games and the TV show. The part in the laundrette is already creepy, as is the one on the first planet, but the one with the Weeping Angels? Those parts will blow their little minds to smithereens. Come on, an age restriction of 12 years would be appropriate.


All in all it is a beautiful experience, especially for Doctor Who fans. I don't regret buying this game immediately the day it came out. I particularly enjoyed the first half of the part with the Daleks. Sneaking around was a lot of fun, even without a ""sneak mode"". Great work.
Now I want more -- more console rooms, more Doctors, more locations, more adventure :)","Feb 25, 2020 at 2:08 AM",4, 35,
2022-05-28 18:26:19.072675,Triangled,Intriguing and Immersive Stylish Puzzler,"Really torn between four and five stars. Deserves a 4.5. I started on the Quest version, which was a disappointment only because of immersion-breaking crashes. Seems as though this one was tough to port to Quest. The Rift version on the other hand (I can play thanks to crossbuy and Oculus Link), is a real treat. Much more detailed, immersive and less-prone to crashing. 

Voice acting is superb, as you’d expect given the actress’ well-established talent. Perhaps it’s my hearing, but the voice overs are a little too quiet against the soundtrack. Sometimes I find myself struggling to hear the narration. While the nature-oriented spaces are relatively generic, the spaceship scenes are superb and super stylish. Lots of blinking lights, old-school control panels and “analog” feel. 

Just completed the “laser puzzle” at time of writing. Boy — challenging stuff. Not necessarily a criticism, but the first couple of puzzles were easy. The laser puzzle represents quite a ramping up in terms of difficulty. Be prepared to spend some time with this one. 

Overall, totally recommended. I’d absolutely buy it again, and I’m fairly choosey.","Feb 17, 2020 at 8:11 AM",4, 9,
2022-05-28 18:26:22.177371,blueacclaim,Oh My God Wow. (Spoilers),"Well. I am amazed with the amount of effort put into this game. The part that really got me was the Angels. I mean Oh My God Wow. I haven't beaten it as of writting this. However, I'm about to go back in and try. I am terrified of them. They are realistic and move as if you were there. Now, I know that I am stood in my Living Room but I felt like they were down that hall. that they were right there. I couldn't sleep last night, so all I've got to say is well done to the team that worked on the game. It is amazing. If you like a good fright or love your puzzle games, this is the game for you. I have got one question to the team, can I skip the Angels. Slightly kidding. I'm amazed and thank you for doing Doctor Who justice. Wow.","Feb 20, 2020 at 9:01 PM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 18:26:22.192331,Megalithik,Short but Good,"As a new Who fan, I'm enjoying the game.  It's a bit on rails, with puzzles to solve, a sense of tension and some jump scares.  The game looks pretty good with lots of different movement options.  The one thing lacking is proper sound adjustments.  I find the music is far too loud and can make the voice over speech difficult to hear at times.  I wish i could turn the music down to 50%.

Backwards? Both? Not sure but doesn't matter, as there's no way to POINT, so a backhand-ish movement is all you get, which gives a very vague, imprecise control.

Great game!","Mar 2, 2020 at 12:36 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 18:26:22.238209,Dannycopo42,Nicely Done,"Let's start with the positives:
1.) The game looks Gorgeous, and runs pretty well for it too!
2.) For a Who fan, being whisked away to different locations in the TARDIS and seeing different monsters was amazing. (I really loved the intro sequence in the time vortex - made me wish it was easier to replay that bit!)
3.) The puzzles didn't get stale and were never overused, although it would have been nice to see some more inventive bits with the sonic
4.) The horror parts of this game definitely struck hard - I've never felt more terror in a VR game yet! (Although I don't play that many horror games)

And now the negatives:
1.) The characters speak a little too much and sometimes you find yourself just sitting around and listening doing nothing a couple of times, and occasionally multiple short voice lines intersected, especially when characters repeat themselves over and over telling you to do something, however it only really happened once or twice in the game so not really a dealbreaker.
2.) In some areas of the stealth sequences where you have to distract enemies, they would sometimes just not investigate the object at all forcing you to wait around for them to get to a certain area of ther patrol again, this only happens once in the game, however it could be frustrating especially to new super new VR users if they have nobody to guide them.

Conclusion:
This was a pretty good take on a Doctor who vr game, It looks good, scares good, puzzles decently and is overall a must-buy for any Who fan, and a decent experience for any sci-fi fan in general. ;)","Jan 31, 2020 at 5:29 AM",4, 2,

The ONLY thing I would change is the  movement speed.  even with the setting at MAX speed the  turning and walking are EXTREEMLY slow paced.  I hate teleporting in games but I found myself  using teleport to get  to the other side of a room .. so it would not take so  long.  Everything else is really great.   The music  helps with the jump scares just like the Dr. Who TV show.    NON-FANS may not want to spend so much on a puzzle game.

2022-05-28 18:26:25.410723,prokopatch,"a mediocre, underwhelming, raw scrap","wow, where do I even begin? ok, at first, it's just totally raw. it doesn't feel even close to being a complete game, more of a late beta version. there are dozens of minor bugs, some of which make the game unplayable and require restarting the whole thing. then comes more noticeable ""features"" such as poor made textures which totally killed the magic for me. I'm not talking about all of them, just saying that the develpoers took a shortcut here and there, or just as I said, it's raw. and what's with those hands? was it so hard to at least make gloves or something? and if you think that the plot is more important, it's messed up as well. there was very good comment somwhere above that ""the game tells you more about the story than you play it"" and it pretty much describes the gameplay. you just walk around a bit, do a dumb puzzle, some of witch doesn't even work properly and then listen a piece of story being told by the doctor or the computer lady, whatever her name is. then there is a lot of missed opportunities to use a sonic screwdriver and god, I know that the game is E rated but the never ending babbling about your surroundings when you're doing a pre-school level puzzle completely killed my experience. also a lot of missed opportunity with TARDIS. that's where the better moments of the game begin. it was genuinely fun to operate TARDIS for the first time, but, for the last time as well. the dalek thing was not exactly necessary, but also admittedly fun. then there are those small things like when the screen gets darker when you move with a thumbstick, which is an understandable feature, but totally useless and even mildly irratating. what actually worked really well for me were the easter eggs, and that's why I rated the game 2/5. 
My advice to anyone who wants to buy the game: reread the things I mentioned and think three times before actually spending 25$ on it

I was initially impressed by the graphics and all the easter eggs, however it quickly became boring to me. It quickly became a basic puzzle VR game and I got kind of bored.

Pros
-Great Doctor Who references and Easter Eggs.
-Fantastic use of music and sound to set the tone.
-Several very good tense moments.
-Good humor and writing for chracters.

Cons
-Puzzles are generally too simple.
-Sonic Screwdriver felt forgotten most of the game.
-Many tense parts quickly become tedious and boring.
-Too much being told the plot instead of experiencing the plot.
-Game quickly felt safe and very few parts have consequences for fialure.

Overall I think it's a great walk through Doctor Who for the fans, but as a casual viewer of the show, the game quickly lost its allure and my gamer side feels it could absolutely have been much more ambitious. If we get another game, I'd like to see them improve on the weak points of this one, and make it more of a game and less of a display room.","Nov 16, 2019 at 12:10 PM",3, 6,
2022-05-28 18:26:31.739796,Timevortex_,Huge Difference between Quest and Rift,"So i got this game and started playing on the Quest, where it looked acceptable.... if you can call it that, tho it still has a pretty great atmosphere and feels nice to play. But i would not buy this game if i wouldnt have the option to play it with Oculus link, cuz the game looks just 10x nicer. I mean i get that the quest is basically a phone but Vader immortal did it too. All in all a must buy for People who own a Desktop VR or can use Oculus Link, cuz its awesome. Also Allons-y...","Mar 3, 2020 at 4:11 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 18:26:34.875409,FPV7,Tracking issues,"Its impossible to enter the pin number i want into the safe at the start, i try for a 2 it dose a 7 or a 0 or 8, but never the number im aiming for, Very frustrating","Nov 13, 2019 at 3:19 AM",3, 9,"Sorry you found this frustrating, we are working on a patch to allow players the option to enter the digits to the safe individually. The present mechanic requires you to find the numbers hidden in the environment, once both sets of numbers are found hitting the keypad (whatever number) will automatically enter the correct number sequence. If you require any further assistance please email info@maze-theory.com."
2022-05-28 18:26:34.891366,DirkWinston,BIG Dr Who fan  and I am loving the game,"I want to thank the developers for speaking to the problem I was having entering the numbers in the safe. The fact that they enter automatically once you find the digits was very helpful.  Got the screwdriver and am off on the journey you created for us. I am really enjoying the game. I love Dr. Who and enjoy puzzle games so I am really appreciating the effort you all put into designing the game. Also, having Jodie Whitaker do the voice talent is excellent, though I would appreciate it if you would do another game utilizing the talents of David Tenant and Matt Smith. They're my favorite doctors. But all in all it's a great game . Thanks so much for your work on it.","Nov 24, 2019 at 8:55 AM",5, 1,

And boy I was right, the weeping angles were scary as! the daleks kept me on edge and those red eyed things teryfied me! although a few things bugged me, I was in the place with the daleks the third room with the big pillar to be exact and i hid behind a mtal thing protruding from the wall but the Dalek was able to see me! so that something that NEEDS to be fixed but ther than that i LOVED it 11/10!","Nov 16, 2019 at 4:01 PM",5, 4,

I loved all of it, but the Weeping Angel part had me screaming.  I also spent way too much time looking at the outside of the Tardis, then the inside sequentially thinking ""It's bigger on the inside!"" (no idea how they did this in Unity) - regardless - Highly, HIGHLY recommend for any Doctor Who fans!","Nov 13, 2019 at 10:25 AM",5, 4,

2022-05-28 18:26:38.035955,IIIZoNeRIII,Any Doctor Who Fan will Enjoy This Game,"I've been a fan of Dr Who in the 4th Doctor in the 80's, so when I was was able to walk around the TARDIS and play with the knob I was totally nerd'n out. The game was fun, with a few decent puzzles here and there. I bit too much hand holding though, with hints repeating over and over and over when you're even just exploring the room to check it out. Be nice to turn those hints off.  It is a bit short, so I timed myself and it took me 2 hours and 12 mins to finish. Though it did feel more like an hour.  Overall this a simple game with pretty simple puzzles and it's pretty much a quick, once and done, adventure.  I do hope they make another Dr Who that's at least twice as long, so non fans can  get more value for the price.","Nov 15, 2019 at 1:29 AM",4, 3,

I finished it in only 2 hours, but its worth the price because its literally the best Doctor Who game you will ever get. The voice acting is really great and the visuals are quite nice too. You should give it a try ! :)","Nov 18, 2019 at 3:07 AM",5, 1,

Interactive items highlight when either hand gets near, but can only be manipulated with the left hand for some reason. Code for the safe cannot be reliably entered as hands have no ""point"" pose (grip w/o trigger).  Very disappointing as this seems like an otherwise AAA experience.","Nov 21, 2019 at 7:01 AM",2, 2,

2022-05-28 18:26:44.391956,ParadiseDecay,Scarier than you think!,"My Initial Thoughts:
Back in the day I use to be a big Doctor Who fan, but I haven't really followed the latest series. So would this game appeal to someone not familiar with the series, I would say yes.
The game itself is superb, it's highly polished, it scared me to death at times and it has a great puzzle element, also the story is as good as anything you would see on the BBC.
I jumped into this game not knowing what to expect and it delivered the atmosphere you can only really get in VR.
