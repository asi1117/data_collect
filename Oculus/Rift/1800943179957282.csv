2022-05-28 18:46:34.706799,Tivers,How to choose which control has the bat?,"Im really enjoying this so far, but occasionally the bat swaps between the left and right control (oculus rift) and I cant work out why it's doing that. i'd prefer it on the left side but upon opening the game it defaults to the right control. how do I change it?","Mar 5, 2021 at 8:09 PM",4, 2,

It does feel pretty realistic inasmuch as it lures me into miscueing short balls etc. Overall, it's great fun using an Oculus Quest and 3m cable to connect to Oculus Rift. I look forward to what I am sure will be lots of new improvements and updates. Well done, team.","Jan 21, 2021 at 7:31 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:46:34.735721,OdinTheOdious,Unfortunately this is abandonware,"I played this game on a Quest via Link with the newer Oculus Touch Controllers and it's impossible to get the cricket bat to face the correct way/forwards. As such this game isn't suitable for the Rift S or Quest via Link due to them both using these newer controllers. I contacted the developers and received no response. At this point this game is abandonware on the Oculus store and shouldn't be being sold to owners of current gen Oculus HMDs.

Despite there having been a recent update it has done nothing to address the fact that when you pick up the bat it does not align it correctly on the newer (Rift S and Quest) Oculus Touch controllers. As far as I can see all they've added is some new transfers on some of the bats you can select which is pointless if the bat won't face the right way.

So it may well not be abandonware but it may as well be as it's not playable on a Rift S or Quest.","Aug 14, 2020 at 9:33 PM",1, 11,
2022-05-28 18:46:34.750681,shaonD,Great Game,"I played it with Oculus Quest through Oculus link. Everything run smoothly. I am having lot of fun with this game. Its giving me an experience like real batting. 
Though some places need to be improved like its hard to write name, choose wickets, over, color using bat. 
But it is still in developing phase. So waiting for actual release. 
For dress color, please use different color for different team when color is not white. 
BTW when you will remove the base under each player?","Jul 21, 2020 at 3:07 AM",5, 7,
