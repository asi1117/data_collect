2022-05-28 18:31:52.011184,pabe05,Good looking and challenging,"Graphics look great with a fully rendered stadium and realistic bats. Hitting seemed easier with the rift than the rift s.  Games scoring should be explained.
The addition of time seems off.  Hit one far enough and time should be added.
But at times it doesnt happen. Time ticks off if you hit a homerun and pitcher doesnt pitch til fireworks end. A lot of time wasted when high or long homers or high fouls are hit.
Over all a fun game that makes you feel there.  Worth the price.","Nov 1, 2019 at 7:21 AM",4, 3,
2022-05-28 18:31:52.027142,Seven_Shooter,I like but!,"Something is wrong! I went on a streak, missing only one pitch and still didn't claim top Hr spot. Note: I'm already tied but this game does something to hold u back. Im not talking about the golden ball. Update this also maybe a lil haptic feedback.","Oct 3, 2019 at 11:06 PM",3, 4,
