My Initial Impressions:
This game features 5 different scenarios. I thought the first one was the best and it gives you a taste of what to expect in the other 4.
The other 4 scenarios progressively start to feel lacklustre as you play through them, and I got the feeling that the developers were running out of ideas.
Also using the same jump/scare mechanics over and over in each scenario started to feel a little ""meh"" and forced after a while.
I think I would have preferred the developers to simply focus all their efforts on the 1st scenario, making it the best one incorporating all the other original ideas and elements from the other 4 scenarios. 
Also the game loads quite a lot which breaks immersion most of the time.","Jul 10, 2020 at 12:24 AM",3, 14,"Thank you for your feedback, we are listening to everyone who wrote to us, and we will be improving more and adding new elements, thanks for playing!"
