2022-05-28 19:32:28.365773,Isilfor,Amazing game! One of my favorites!,"The game is very short, but the level is great.
Interesting lighting and very atmospheric.
You really feel like a chained giant. When you move, the chains react. And also this little man runs downstairs.
If anyone knows similar games, please advise. 

A gamepad is required to play.
By rotating the stick to the left you create a portal, with the A button you can teleport to it.
Rotating to the right, you levitate. If you rotate it longer, then you get an explosion and you can be thrown out of the level.",Dec 28 at 1:17 AM,5, 3,
2022-05-28 19:32:28.380732,Kylriath,wow,"for those who didn t catch it, use a gamepad to play. Once in the game , experiment with the right stick to go on.","Sep 28, 2020 at 5:01 PM",5, 4,
2022-05-28 19:32:28.395692,jape79,Great little game,"I started this about four years ago but got distracted by other things. I just reinstalled it today. It's a short demo-type dungeon game that took me about 30 minutes, including learning the controls, which I did through trial-and-error (might have missed the instructional phase, if there was one.) It's mysterious and dark and you don't really know what you're supposed to be doing, so you need to be patient. Something nice to check out if you've got a small block of time.","Apr 26, 2020 at 9:58 AM",5, 2,
2022-05-28 19:32:28.411649,zoidberg590,DOES NOT WORK WITH CURRENT HARDWARE,"This game, or at least the original DK2 demo, are really beautiful and have so much potential to be a major franchise. But no-one with modern hardware can play unless they buy an x-box controller? It doesn't work with touch. Such a waste of potential I have no idea why the dev isn't updating the game and basking in glory.","Dec 7, 2019 at 6:09 AM",3, 7,

2022-05-28 19:32:31.550856,EFalchek,Recenter????,As amazing as this game looks it is a game I never had the pleasure to play. As soon as the world animates itself to the main screen it tells you to move into the circle and click the left trigger. No matter where I am in the circle the left trigger does not start the game or activate in any way so I am just standing here frustrated. If it is fixed or if someone can give me troubleshooting then ill gladly play but right now it gets a 1 star.,"Nov 13, 2018 at 5:15 AM",1, 8,

2022-05-28 19:32:31.580776,Waynosan,Great demo,"Leaving high rating hoping dev takes notices and creates a full title with 1st person view.  The dungeon ambiance in this title is amazing, would be so sweet to have a dungeon crawler based around the same tech, hopefully with fluid motion.  I hate teleport.","Dec 10, 2017 at 2:46 AM",5, 5,

2022-05-28 19:32:34.744457,Zorritini,"Wow, amazing proof of concept","This is the best example I've seen of a 'living diorama' scenario, where you really feel you're guiding a tiny hero though a proper scene. As others have said the Supersampling feels like it could be higher, and it's just a quick one room affair. But still, lovely execution, with the fun physics knocking around too.","Nov 4, 2017 at 6:55 AM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 19:32:34.759417,EldradWolfsbane,Chris Medders,Great game! I have a dungeon called the Black Stairs that would look great in this system. It's for my simplifed D20 sytem called Back to the Dungeon on DriveThruRPG. It' pay what you want! For some reason my last post was cancelled due to profanity?

You can jump, you could do some more magic tricks i suppose (i didnt try them much), handy zooming into the little dude's perspective to make sure you are not about to miss that narrow foot bridge :)

2022-05-28 19:32:37.903129,Dagas,Awesome Concept,Love it.  Really good.  Took me about 15 mins.  Needs some work on controller side but regardless once you quickly figure it out its a breeze.  The feeling of size works.  Coming in and out of the giant's perspective and the disciple's perspective was pretty awesome.  I was totally immersed.,"May 29, 2017 at 11:28 AM",5, 0,

2022-05-28 19:32:37.933049,neuro27,Incredible Experience,"This free app puts you in the position of a giant and allows you to control some kind of cult worshiper trying to set you free. It does a great job of imparting the feeling of being a larger-than-life being, and experience one can only have in VR. Could use some polish though - I noticed some movement bugs, and it doesn't play as smoothly as it could.","Mar 24, 2017 at 3:18 AM",4, 1,

2022-05-28 19:32:41.052770,Greyhawk101,Flawed by poor controls,"Graphics are great, idea is brilliant. Controls are very poor and there are no instructions. You cannot jump seemingly and the game uses its own bad controls to kill you over and over again by randomly pinging you off any high ledge. If you lose a box you cannot get over obstacles and they are not replaced which means you cannot continue. Needs a lot of work but the idea is sound.","Jan 28, 2017 at 5:37 AM",2, 0,
2022-05-28 19:32:41.067730,Mawthra,"Oh, wow!","This is probably the coolest thing I've experienced in VR... I had no idea what to expect going into it and I'm glad I experienced it that way. Considering when this was released and I can't find anything on the developers site, I fear this is all it will ever  be :( Here's hoping I'm wrong... I would drop money on this in a heartbeat if it were a full game fully fleshed out. Like others have said... KICKSTART THIS THING!!!","Jan 8, 2017 at 12:18 PM",5, 1,

2022-05-28 19:32:44.165549,Haydemoon,Amazing FX in this!,"The art style and special FX in this are pretty amazing and lifelike.  From the spell casting, to the smoke around your torch/wand.  It's quirky gameplay and you really have to move around to see well enough to know where to go to attempt to release two big chains and free ""guess what?""  Also use the left shoulder to change perspective to a First Person to look around from new angles.  It's quite bazaar and not like anything I've played other than maybe levels in Little Big Planet.  It's Free and it's really a must see at that!","Dec 24, 2016 at 3:42 PM",4, 0,

This was the first game I saw that used desktop diorama scale to such good effect. I find this kind of game far more interesting than the typical first-person experience.

2022-05-28 19:32:53.647531,Vilkeem,Must try! Need more games like this!,"Unlike a lot of people who had a bad experience getting the game to run, it worked and played fine for me. 6700K, GTX1080, CV1 w/touch.
This game 'experience' is such a cool idea and is very highly recommended, even just to feel the immersion of controlling the character and then switching to first-person view. I hadn't played a lot of titles before this one and found the change from observer to first-person to be quite a thrill. And it was probably my first nearly sick-inducing experience to go from observer to first-person while the character is in motion... quite a rush!
Anyways, bottom line is that this demo was a very nifty idea and I really wish for a feature length game in it's likeness. Two small non-complaints (due to the price tag) are the lack of variety of environment (it's quite simplistic and similar textures throughout), and also that the whole experience was a tad bit frustratingly dark...difficult to make out features of the level. I would honestly pay for something similar in a proper length.","Mar 20, 2020 at 4:21 PM",5, 0,
