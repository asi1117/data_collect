The biggest issue is the tips they block out the whole screen and I have not found away to remove or shrink etc for them. Second having a NPC in game for a few levels basically teaching those unfamiliar would be awesome especially if it tells us what we do wrong and how to fix it. And my lady issue is where's the wind the air I was hoping for full immersion and having to adjust for the flow of wind by looking at clothes or grass etc moving in the wind some more maps/ levels that open after achieving master could incorporate this and could even be used as a dlc I'd buy it. All that said the mechanics in this game are amazing the graphics outstanding every other aspect of this game is great I wish I could walk around and explore because of it is very well made maybe in the second game we can have an explorer mode kinda rpg like that would be amazing TY for this awesome game I have really enjoyed it.",Aug 10 at 1:31 AM,5, 1,

More challenges, more variety? I think there might be potential to make archers enjoy staying in a game mode even more. :)","May 6, 2021 at 4:52 AM",5, 0,
2022-05-28 18:50:47.482714,Mezbar,Great mechanics,"I like the mechanics of the game. However, when you release the arrow it doesn't follow the path it slides past the bow. Instead it allways hit to the right. This should be an easy fix in an update however, and I will change my review when it is fixed.

Edited: I stand corrected by a very thorough reply. And after some reasearch of my own, I must admit the devs are right. I have been shooting with bow in real life a lot when I was a kid, but appearantly with arrows that wasnt tuned to my bow.  (bit to stiff) Other vr games have made my instinctive shooting adjusted to a less realistic mechanic.","Dec 22, 2020 at 6:13 AM",5, 3,"Hi Mezbar, thanks for your feedback. If you look at the tutorial you'll find information about the archer's paradox. It means that when the arrow rests on the bow it is not aligned with the bow and nocking point on string, but its tip is instead offset by the radius of the bow. Upon release, the arrow spine curves around the bow and straightens in flight to align in the direction of the force that propelled it; nocking point on the string pushing towards arrow rest on bow.
 We wanted to make the mechanics true to real-world medieval archery and that means whenever you try to aim ""down the arrow"" you will be off target. 
The true way to shoot instinctively is to allow your mind and body to learn how the arrow flies when you perform the same draw and release. Choose a target at say 15 meters, try to hit it bullseye without aiming, and note where the arrow hits. Find your anchor point; cheek, ear, shoulder, and be consistent. Keep shooting and make sure you draw to the same anchor point each time. Once you are hitting the target consistently you practice at a longer distance and continue so on. 
Just let go of the aiming and you'll be a master real soon :)
Happy shooting!"

Can this game able to play with the Quest VR headset, if possible.  Because it will be the best Archery game in the wireless headset.  Many Quest owners will love to play this great game.

The endless mode in level 2 is great.  I lost all my lifes so easy so soon , but with the endless mode,  I can play target shooting for as long as I want to play time without losing the life.

Please to have this endless mode to all levels if possible. 

Or one suggestion.  How can the player to reward new life or regain new heart to have longer gameplay.   May be to have 10 life in easy mode , 5 life in normal mode and 3 heart in hard mode.

Again, 5 stars game, great VR game for everyone to enjoy.  
more levels please , if possible.   Thank you. 🤩","Apr 13, 2020 at 9:53 AM",5, 3,
