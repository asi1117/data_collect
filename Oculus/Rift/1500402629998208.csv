The UI/VR implementation are confusing, and the gameplay modes don't do a good job showcasing what could have been a good amount of solid content.","Mar 6, 2019 at 5:44 AM",1, 3,

I had actually seen it on the steam store and almost pulled the trigger.  I think this is a very good game, but you do need a nice sized roomscale setup and sensors picking up things correctly to do well.  This game will have you weaving, bobbing, jumping, shooting, punching, and sweating with a matter of minutes.  This is not a game for those of you who are out of shape.  This game requires quick reflexes and good peripheral vision.  If you manage to beat this game, you're probably a ninja.  I'm having a hard time just getting past the first few levels :O","Dec 11, 2017 at 1:50 PM",5, 9,
