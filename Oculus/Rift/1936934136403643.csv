2022-05-28 18:26:46.638946,uavdude,Once you understand what it is...,"It's not a game, but you can play games.  It's a platform, but you will need to learn how to use it as such.  Or you can meet people and socialize, go to a night club or a comedy club.  And now you can go to stores and connect to peoples e-commerce websites.  For a Pre-Beta game, it's pretty fun.  And the developers are quite responsive and accessible.  Don't get Sharded!",Apr 1 at 11:34 AM,5, 6,

2022-05-28 18:26:46.668865,tommikee,Infiniverse pre beta,It's an early release with great potential. Even as pre beta it's fun and addictive. I've met some wonderful people and setup a store front. Really looking forward to seeing where they take this.,13 days ago,4, 1,
2022-05-28 18:26:46.682828,shuffnstuff,Furure History Being Made,"This game is as intriguing as it is entertaining. The social aspect is more fun than the property buying.  Even Pre Beta, The speed at which this game is evolving is mind blowing.  The developers are readily accessible and make changes practically in real time.  It’s fun and challenging to try to predict the flow of population development which is largely influenced by the users. Which is where the social interactions make this game entertaining. Meet people, add friends, rally like minded people, build a neighborhood and literally be put on the map.  An Economy is being developed within the game and real world, economic returns are expected.  But mostly have fun with it.",Mar 5 at 5:29 PM,5, 8,

You start with 500 meta coins that you can buy a level of a building with, but it has to be on the outskirts of major cities... it's easy to develop and I did a search on youtube for videos, watching GamerSan and his vision... and how his approach to the multiverse will be. I sincerely hope that he can grow and scale because this is one of the best and easiest platforms I have found to create in.",Mar 20 at 2:38 AM,5, 4,

I can't wait to see where the iniviniverse takes us and i'm proud to say that I am one of many that support the Devs San, Chirs, and Ms. Cummings on the Multiverser/Infiniverse project.

Its pre beta and there have been server issues due to the high demand, which have now been sorted. It is hard to explain the game just try it and you will see. Be warned it is not linked to any Crypo so you can't cash out you property if you think can make a profit.

There's no real customization of your avatar either, which... fine? The biggest problem is the media rooms. They are... not stable.

My 2nd purchase was a Penthouse i finally found available. For cheap...near Dino Park. I don't know what to do with them. I'll just sit on them for a bit. Can't customize anything interactable inside. The ""Penthouse"" looks like a standard apartment..so that was misleading.  Finding people is hard, though i can hear them talk. You have to goto people tab and just ""join"" a random person to find anyone. No mini map...or anything. No easy to way to leave your building to the front of it.",Mar 23 at 3:28 PM,4, 0,

I like the menu, it's easy to navigate and functions well. The home is very nice. All in all a very acceptable experience. I can visualize walking down the street of a busy city with open retail shops, theaters, parks. I very much liked the idea of the metro as a gateway to other places. I can visualize other countries, cities, the possibilities are endless. Good job and best of luck! I'll be visiting often to watch the progress.",Mar 5 at 3:18 AM,4, 1,

2022-05-28 18:26:59.330999,Slick1984,Pretty Cool App For Watching NASA Live,"I must start by saying that I had to reset my view on the Oculus Dash, to have the start button placed in front of me for this app. The green button was placed behind me initially. Once I saw that it was behind me, I pressed the Oculus button and reset my view, then went back into the app and it was in front of me.

After going through their new user set up, it placed me in my home. I explored and played with the rockets, but I was there for the Spacewalk. On your wrists you have a menu. There was a NASA live channel, so I went there. It was interesting watching them get suited up for the event. It's very tedious getting in and out of that equipment. The actual walk was scheduled for battery replacement and upgrade. The amount of care and safety needed for this is always on their minds.

I did explore a little more, but had to leave due to having to go to work. I found it a pleasant place. I did not install this app for the social aspects and maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much. At 6:00am ET not many people were around.  I will continue to look in on some special events and am excited about the other areas yet to be released.

I have found that I can make myself unseen and unheard. Excellent.","Aug 3, 2020 at 3:57 AM",5, 11,

1. It would be nice if the textures / images loaded based on proximity, currently the whole room loads slowly at once rather than prioritizing what you're looking at.

2022-05-28 18:27:02.465615,G1D30N,Future Tech Labs is Looking Ahead,"Multiverse is a fantastic experince built upon a system that is going to grow.

Although I have had plenty of enjoyable experinces in Multiverse, my favorite is the time when my dad, my 6 year old daughter, and myself jumped into the planetarium together. 

I'll admit that I had some concerns about my daughter figuring out how to teleport around and then was astounded to find her using teleportation, smooth locomotion, and jumping from room to room in a mater of minutes. 

We've since visted the planitarium several times together and it's obvious that she is  gathering knowledge about astrophysics and astronomy.  This is a great app for educational intitutions. 

What is more impressive about Multiverse is that this is just the beginning. From discussions with the developers, it is clear that they have built their application to be able to scale and we can expect a variety of experinces to come. 

What makes an app great is the team that drives it. It's apparent that Future Tech Labs has a solid plan. They also have a team with the skills and passion to deliver a well thought out user experience backed with smart technlogy. 

 The developers really listen to user feedback and are activiely working to improve the app through weekly updates. Granted, the app it's self doesn't need to be updated for there to be an entirely new room to show up or a door to unlock. 

I recomend you download the app and get a feel for it even is the planetarium isn't 100% your jam and then keep an eye in the Oculus Events tab.  These are a great opertunity to check out new rooms, domiains, and have some high qulity social experineces.
