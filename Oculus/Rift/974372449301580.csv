2022-05-28 15:43:39.230646,setablaze777,Fun game for the price,"Great game to play local co-op. You do need to use a contoller, but other than that, I think it's a good deal for the price we paid ($10).","May 3, 2020 at 12:05 PM",4, 4,
2022-05-28 15:43:39.246604,MacTieth,Surprised,"Back before this was on Oculus, one of the big bugs was that you couldn't snap-turn left with the oculus touch controllers.  It's now been out on Oculus for a while and snap-turning still isn't fixed.  I'm not gonna turn right three times to turn left folks.","Aug 21, 2019 at 11:21 AM",1, 10,
2022-05-28 15:43:39.260567,mongoose8008,Not worth the price.,"The game itself plays well enough, but for $10 it's a waste of cash. The graphics are so minimal, and the lack of any sort of light mapping makes the game just feel stale and flat. The silly looking box enemies took me out the experience, and everything was so minimal I couldn't enjoy the experience.
It had a solid foundation, and a cool idea, but I've played games 100x better for $2.","Dec 6, 2018 at 10:22 PM",1, 7,
2022-05-28 15:43:39.275526,pj10,Great fun,This is a lot of fun to play with two people. I wish you could use a controller as well but still a great game.,"Dec 2, 2018 at 11:00 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 15:43:39.292481,stealthkk,Test your crap,"If they had tested this game on the Oculus platform, which they clearly haven't, they would have realized that there are buttons on the Oculus touch controller that DONT WORK. I'm sick of games converting their crappy bs from the steam/vive world and spending 10 minutes on the port. The controllers are DIFFERENT. Get your thick crappy steam vive podunk skull wrapped around that and do some GD testing. You get NOTHING because I can't even play the game.","Jul 17, 2018 at 11:06 AM",1, 24,"Hi stealthkk,

2022-05-28 15:43:42.401166,Irengard,No Online multiplayer,Game supports local play but never did it say that it was ONLY local play.  Friend and I bought this game thinking we could play together on two different computers.

2022-05-28 15:43:42.416126,theregoes2,There needs to be more games like this,I love these asynchronous games. I wish more developers would consider it. It makes having friends over and using VR a lot more fun.,"Jul 2, 2017 at 9:29 AM",5, 6,
2022-05-28 15:43:42.432083,kame00,Fun With Groups,"I like VR games you can play with groups and everyone wins together; this one maybe 3 people max. Especially fun with young ones, but someone needs to be able to type fast; nice way to split responsibilities. Learn communication skills and cooperation is a super fun way! Warning: sensitive people can get motion-sickness.","Mar 3, 2017 at 7:02 AM",5, 4,
