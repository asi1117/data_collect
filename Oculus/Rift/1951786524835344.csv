2022-05-28 13:42:37.127246,SolidRustle,A very basic wave shooter,"I actually expected more out of this game, it's very basic wave shooter with zero new mechanic. The difficulty is above average, the enemies just keep spawning and are bullet sponges. The guns doesnt feel great to shoot and 2 handed weapons are a literal pain to use because you can't ungrab the left hand and if you need to rest your arm (which you will need) you basically cant keep shooting because it's stuck to your controller. I will say the graphic is pretty nice (performance, not so much) and the voice acting story is decent to good.","Feb 18, 2021 at 8:11 AM",3, 2,

2022-05-28 13:42:37.156169,Targaid,Brilliant fun,"Illogical, implausible, immensely entertaining.

When you played cowboys and Indians as a kid did you ever run out of bullets? Same here. Insane amounts of enemies and enough ammo to take them on. Want gritty realism? Forget it. Want a true old West SIM? Look elsewhere. Want fun and a bit of a challenge? This is it.

Issues? Learning to aim the two handed weapons isn't easy. Another review blames tracking but it's getting the hang of positioning your hands as if holding one longer weapon that's the problem. One of the arcade levels where you have to stop bad guys getting into the brothel always locks up in the Rift version. It should be able to track scores between the rift and quest versions so improvements don't have to be made on both platforms.

Minor niggles and don't stop the game being the most fun I've had in a game in years.","Nov 26, 2020 at 11:26 PM",4, 2,

Being able to go postal in a wild west town is such a blast. I haven't played it all the way through in fact I'm only on the first level but what I've experienced already has made this my favorite Rift game. With a $12 USB-3 cable it runs great and I don't see any artifacts or drop in graphics quality at all. Please consider expanding or bringing out a sequel; some time you just want to have fun rather than play more intense shooters. One question, is there any way to save your progress?","Feb 2, 2020 at 8:10 AM",5, 4,Thanks for your review.

To make it short - it was a really exhausting experience.

2022-05-28 13:42:49.815296,Lavender_Lavender,Fun western theme with modern weapons,"Guns n Stories has an arcade feel with a western theme. 
I enjoyed the modern twist on the weapons which kept me from getting bored with just a regular 6 shooter.
The characters or enemies come out from different places and the player just keeps shooting.
There’s a simplicity to this game  (which doesn’t mean that it is a simple game or that the developer did not work hard on it. I can see that much work went into it.) 
I can play with out having to concentrate on puzzles or looking behind me all the time. A relief after a had day. 
Although a bit cheesy... (but cheesy is fun) the story line is creative. 
I am happy that I can skip the narration when desired for non repetitive re-playability.  
 The game gets harder with more creative enemies. I also like that you can shoot anything else you can see; (ie: bottles)for extra shooting fun.
The arm work out in the harder levels is an extra benefit. 

FEEDBACK/NOTE TO DEVELOPER:
In the first act, and the first section... starting shortly before the boy is talking about the jokes Grandpa makes.... It sounds like there are 2 sound tracks overlapping each other. Very distracting. I replayed the level and it happens every time.","Jul 18, 2019 at 2:58 AM",5, 7,

If you were lucky enough to get it on sale, like I did, then you got a super deal; still worth full price though.  (I don't remember saying that about any other games I got on sale)  

The starting room took me 10 minutes to get out of; not very intuitive user interface, but still not enough to drop this one to 4 stars.  (HINT: Grab the first statue on the desk with your left hand by pulling your left trigger...then point to the mission on the statue in your left hand with your right hand and finally pull and 'hold' the trigger on your right hand until you see the white bar fill up. - hopefully that will save someone a headache)

Shooting is very chalaging yet still very fun.  Graphics look great.  Has a great  arcade feel.  This is also a great arm workout, whew!  All around very cool game!!  One of my wife's favorite VR games as well.  Definitely recommended.","Nov 23, 2018 at 12:26 AM",5, 13,

If you're looking for a study-level sim, with accurate ballistics and wound-cavity behavior of the .45 LC cartridge, historically-relevant themes or whatever, and you're one of those blistering pains in the nu*$ that you want to bludgeon to death during a movie because you take yourself, and everything else in life, too seriously (like a certain reviewer who shall remain nameless), and can't resist saying ""oh that's not very realistic"" every 22 seconds, this is probably not for you. On the other hand, if you're a relatively normal human being who likes to have fun, and can appreciate things for what they're intended to be, you'll LOVE this! It's funny, entertaining, and there's the real visceral satisfaction of endlessly flinging tons of lead at a never-ending swarm of ""bad guys"".

2022-05-28 13:42:56.157576,FastLawyer,Average 180 wave shooter & 2D story,"This is a mediocre wave shooter set in a western world that's all about shooting stuff several times.  It has some nice qualities and some bad ones.  First and foremost, there's a story to the game.  It's about a grandpa telling tall tales to his grandson who fetches his grandpa more beer to hear more of his story.  That's already pretty unrealistic, but let's go with it anyways.  Currently there are two levels with three stages each (and a coming third level).  There's some rudimentary animations on a movie screen before each stage while you can eat popcorn.  You can also just skip it.  My main problem with the game is that although there is some variety, there's also a lot of repetition.  I started to hate my handguns.  You have to press trigger over and over to take down targets.  It feels like maybe you're shooting spit balls and it looks like it too, at least the 16 bit version.  The bullet physics are pathetic.  There are different enemy types, but it usually doesn't matter.  They either run up to you like idiots, or snipe at you behind cover.  You do break up the monotony when you get a repeater handgun and enemies start throwing dynamite and rpgs at you and drones start flying about, but it's just bullet sponge versus bullet sponge in the end.  Finally, you get a boss fight, but it was more of the same only a bigger bullet sponge.  I guess on a deep sale you might want to get this, but there's better versions of this game.  Saloon Showdown VR is the best western shooter in VR.  High Noon VR is also just about better in every way than this game.  And of course, Dead and Buried is amazing with friends.  Get those instead is my advice.","Mar 11, 2018 at 12:33 AM",3, 8,"We have already responded to such a letter earlier :)
With the mention of the same games that are supposedly better than ours.
This is a cheap trick that does not honor High Noon, or whoever you represent.

""We love games and want to make a VR-gaming enjoyable and widespread. That is why we wanted to create a simple, fun and dynamic game, in which people could fall out of reality for a short time and get fresh and bright emotions that can be experienced only in childhood. Pure fun!


Our cowboys comes from Hollywood, so they do not waste time for reloading weapons, can dodge bullets and easily deal with hordes fearsome, but invariably comical enemies.



You will not be languish with the boredom and monotony of traditional westerns, because we added to the game an impressive arsenal of firearms, throwing weapons, and even futuristic weapons.



Those of you who will not skip storyline will be able to see in the game more than the ""regular wave shooter."" (Take advantage of this to take a breath after the heated shootings).

We are sure that you will appreciate the diversity of locations, the jokes of old Bill and the driving soundtrack of the western and blues rock.
