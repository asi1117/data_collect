This game is a easy party game where anyone can do it with no skill to enjoy it.   That being said you will need a lot of skill later on as you gain power and levels.","Sep 9, 2020 at 10:45 AM",5, 1,
2022-05-28 20:58:44.775695,Satconcook,Asteroids in 2020,"This certainly shows inspiration from the original Asteroids game, but in actual 3D space. It takes a moment to get used to the controls and standing works best so you can physically look around as the cubes and your ship will fly around you. The pause to rotate 90 degrees is a bit odd to drop out of action, almost wished there was a jump to ship option so that full orientation was now facing from the ship. Your head and hands are also solid objects so your ship and other blocks can bounce off. It is free to play, but to save and continue from your current wave you must buy it, for a reasonable $2.99. Although, like the original Asteroids game, it is just more and more of the same thing with occasional new enemies thrown in. So, it kind of got boring fairly quick.

Update:The added first person view makes it feel a lot better. I played a lot longer being able to see the environment from the ship perspective.","May 21, 2020 at 12:31 PM",4, 2,
2022-05-28 20:58:44.790655,VirtuaLieven,"nice, but no immersion","The graphics are wonderful and the game seems a lot of fun - but I'm just missing the true VR-experience. You are just sitting and manoeuvering a space ship with your joy-sticks on the controller. Yes, that may be fun for some people, but it's not really interacting with a VR environment.
PS: the app is free, so I still recommend that you try it.","Feb 14, 2020 at 11:11 PM",3, 2,"I'm taking this to heart, at first I was reluctant to place the user in the ship but that's what the people want. Look out for the next release to be able to to immerse yourself into this game! Got to give the people what they want."
2022-05-28 20:58:44.806613,Shakagenghis,Not horrible,"Simple, but I can't get too deep into this if you don't allow the player to turn around by either snap or smoothe rotation.  In one direction my sensors don't work so well, so I don't want to turn around while playing this.  It will be hard to get further into this, and I LOVE old school Maelstrom/Asteroids... so far I am just shooting stationary boxes,  but that should likely change if I get further into the game, right?   ... Thanks for the reply.  Pausing a game to turn around is unacceptable.  Fix it, and this would be cool.  Else, you need 3 sensors.","Feb 6, 2020 at 1:11 PM",3, 0,
