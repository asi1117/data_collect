2022-05-28 20:40:27.203308,MultiDarkZen,Its really not great,"I've played only an hour and I already feel like I've seen everything in the game, the controls are also feel kind of clunky and not fleshed out I get that its early access so I won't bash too hard on it but it doesn't feel great at all especially since you walk so slow its really annoying also for some reason anime protagonist kun is super freaking short in my game making all the other npc models look really, huge really weird, I was kind of hyped for this game to come out and after playing it, its really disappointing after the trailers hyped this game up so much and this is the actual product.",Jan 22 at 3:26 PM,3, 88,
2022-05-28 20:40:27.218269,Jetinkimi,full release?,"The machanics of the game can be rather fun to play around with and while the story is simple, it is interesting. Now for the reason why I game it three stars. The diffuculity curve between chapters can be massive. Going from three strikes to eight or more. It can be a bit grindy but that is nothing new to me. My main issue right now is that i just completed chapter twelve. I killed the ""Trampler"" and the big boss shows its face... then nothing. Nother after that and even tho it said I got the plans for the next sword, it does not show up on the list. I can't go to the next area (if there is any) and there is only level grinding left... was this the full release? If not then when will the rest come out?",Feb 11 at 3:26 AM,3, 9,"Hi, this is an Early Access release.
