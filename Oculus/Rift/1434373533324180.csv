2022-05-28 19:40:36.354683,nightcat.mau,Awesome Coasters!,"Two fun coasters in one pack and both are fairly long rides. The first features mummies who’d love to chop you in two and some other beasties who’d love you to join them for a bite. Yes, there are spiders! Well, gigantic tarantulas that lurk in the ruins. The coaster goes through both the pyramids and ruins and there are some blowing sand effects. The second coaster goes at night through the lit up pyramids and is strangely relaxing. Not bad at all if you like VR coasters.","Jun 18, 2018 at 5:23 AM",5, 2,"Hi nightcat.mau, We are very happy to know that, thank you very much for your review."

2 Tracks (both are quite long). A little bit of a dull atmosphere (well, it is a desert, isn`t it), which may be due to the use of the same models all around the place, still quite a good and thrilling experience. If you are afraid of spiders, just use the beautifully lit night track and stay away from the normal one.","Aug 6, 2017 at 10:40 PM",4, 10,"Hi nuin, Very nice to know you liked and had fun, We are working to do more fun very soon. Thank you very much for your review!"
