2022-05-28 20:35:57.249478,Shake_N_Vac,Google Street View but Low Res,"I know it's free but this was really dissapointing.  The 360 images are not 3D, so there is none of the real world sense of scale VR can bring to things like this, and appear to just be the views avalable on Street View but at a far worse resolution.  

The information in each area is nice but as the low res 2D images mean VR brings nothing to the table here it's just easier to get that info from the KSP website instead.  

High res 3D walkaround images must be within the capabilities of NASA so it's sad they did not take this opportunity to use VR technology to it's fullest, or even nearly fullest, potential.  Especially when there are amateur 3D 360 videos of some of this stuff out there which show just how impressive and immersive VR tourism can be.","Oct 13, 2020 at 1:36 AM",2, 8,

2022-05-28 20:35:57.279398,Tangobaldy,4 minutes was all I could take,"You have to look to select items.  The videos have no sound  and when a picture is displayed there is no way to close it.  The scaling of the 360 photos are terrible and the pixel count is worse than google maps.  Why is this even here?  Go watch a decent youtube video on a 4k tv.  This is not a virtual tour, just a mish mash of low qaulity images that do not in anyway make you feel your there.  fgor example the space shuttle is viewed from the nose and underneath. No way to rotate image or zoom in.  terrible designers here and why was this allowed on the store?","Oct 13, 2020 at 2:38 AM",1, 4,
