2022-05-28 20:49:20.844011,VirtuaLieven,Wonderful,"This is a great and playable demo of a game that looks very promising. I am not an expert of ego-shooters, so it took me about 45 minutes to play through this at beginners level. 
Graphics and sounds are very good, the story voice is good, and the idea behind it seems good as well. Gameplay and usage of controls is very easy to learn and to handle, although I would wish that the activation of weapons was different (using two hands is annoying). Also, the movement may lead to motion sickness, so maybe they could add a way to teleport more.
Nevertheless, definitely worth 5 of 5 stars.","Apr 30, 2020 at 3:48 AM",5, 3,
2022-05-28 20:49:20.858971,Deeperbeige,Broken for me,"I started this and was immediately thrown into a broken menu experience. A menu ahead of me was attached to my headset position, but was too high to be fully visible. My right hand seemed to control a laser, but it didn't seem to do anything. I tried resetting my position via the Oculus dash, no change.

If the devs update this and I spot it's been updated, I'll update this review. But for now, I can only give it one star. Sorry.","May 27, 2020 at 12:07 AM",1, 0,
