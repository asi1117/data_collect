2022-05-28 19:15:41.405006,fayewray71,Very Fun For When you Want a Quick Game,"I see all these negative reviews and can kind of understand - but not really - I keep coming back to this game as it has variety, enjoyability and replayability.  I felt so great when I got past the first 10 days, and even more when I got through 20 - never got to 30.  Just like most others, I have trouble with the axe one, but maybe one day I will get pretty good at it.  The one where you get chased by a giant almost always gives me that little bit of enjoyable terror.  This is not a game you will play every day, but I keep coming back when I want to enjoy myself but don't want to get stuck in something too difficult or lengthy.  I am excited to hear of the possibility of more mini games - thank you to the developers!","Sep 27, 2020 at 6:30 AM",5, 1,"You have no idea how good it is to read your comment, you made my day! It is hard to please everyone and we fully understand that, but sometimes looks like our efforts are in vain :/.
Thank you from the deep of our hearts!"
2022-05-28 19:15:41.419967,RymaSappZ,'Arcade' style game,"The general layout of this game is a series of mini-games that you play to attempt max score streak. The 'lobby' area has very simple functionality - Start, Credits, Sound on/off, and Right-hand or Left-hand selection

On game start, the mini game is random. It varies among crossing a frozen bridge, dodging arrows or other, throwing axes, burning ships by throwing torches, running from giant, drinking mead, etc. Some games take multiple attempts, others can be too easy. Usually never longer than a minute each, celebratory scene in a tavern with other vikings happens after. 

Pros:
'Arcade style'
Easy for quick play and trade off among friends
Axe throwing is realistic (I read the previous review complaining about it, and I understand.. VR axe throwing can be finicky. It's not perfect but would say more realistic than Asgard's wrath)
Mini-game style can be nice
Easy and quick fun, requires relatively low space
Artistic effort is appreciated

Cons:
No customization of gameplay, modes, etc.
A bit underwhelming
Simplistic
No difficulty setting, slow to increase

To devs: may be worth considering making endless or practice modes, even if for specific mini-games like axe throwing, arrowing dodging, etc.

That being said, I will enjoy this game and come back to it even without updates. I think it is decent, gets harder as streak  builds. A good simple low space game to keep and play with or show friends. If updates are done to add game modes such as multiplayer, practice, endless play for specific mini-games, increase difficulty or functionality, or to add more mini-games, could greatly benefit this game. Overall 4.0/5.0, great foundation, could be an awesome game with some updates. Good job Devs keep up the good work, don't give up, game has potential.","Jan 2, 2021 at 8:50 PM",4, 0,
2022-05-28 19:15:41.435924,lordkentucky,Decent game - but quite underwhelming.,"Hey there. I'm gonna treat this as an open letter to the devs (since they answer most reviews).

I've played the game for about 45 minutes now. My record is 17 days. 
It's an interesting game, and I did enjoy some of it. That said, it's worth no more than a dollar, which is what I bought it for. I'd like to give as constructive feedback as possible, so here goes.
My biggest gripe is the axe throwing. Lost both times to that, and there seems to be very little skill involved. First run-through, I lost after 15 days. Second run-through, I lost after 17 days. Both times to the axe throwing game. The second run-through I hit (probably) 60% of my axes on target.... but only one stuck. The rest bounced off. It got very frustrating, and seems very chance based even though I improved from my first run-through. 
There are very few mini games, so they do get quite tiresome after a while. And the difficulty scaling seems very lackluster. Essentially, you just get less time to complete the games. I can't imagine anyone getting very far. For example, on Day 15 I had to run from the giant for the second time. I swing my arm like a maniac, and I only barely made it. How am I supposed to win the next time? I can only swing my arms so fast, without dislocating them. 
Same with the dragon. I'll be doing squats from hell to defeat it. 
There is very little incentive to continue, as there is really no progression, and the gameplay loop become stale very fast due to few minigames. But I think you know that already.
Sidenote: I got an endless load screen twice, resulting in a crash. They happened both times after ""Mind the Gap"" but not always, I was sometimes able to continue on. Thankfully my progress was saved when I opened the game again.

If there is a reason to come back and play, and I will gladly do so. More games, but more importantly, an incentive to go on... some sort of personal progression (rewards maybe?). 
Best of luck to you all!","Jun 14, 2020 at 3:27 AM",3, 4,"Hey man, thanks for the review! Indeed we take by the heart the comments and try to answer all of them as honest as we can be. We are to update the game with more 5 mini games (they are 10 right now), the game progression is made by having the first 10 days more like a tutorial and the rest gets more hard, we have tried the game until day 100 and it is possible (it is crazy I agree), there are some minor changes and not only time, but distance or size of the targets that change over time. Regarding the axe, I get your frustation, but the ""secret"" lies in the spin of the axe, we studied some axe throwing and tried to make it as close as possible to the real one (maybe that was our mistake). TBH it make me sad you say that the game doesn't worth more than a dollar (since we put a lot of time and effort to make it) and I think you can have decent fun when playing as a party game (it was intended to be a party game), but I respect you opinion! Hope you try it again with the new levels ;)"
2022-05-28 19:15:41.450884,MrRavin,Honestly pretty bad,"Everything about it is pretty annoying, the throwing mechanics are horrid, makes you fail almost all the time, graphics are really cartoony and low poly, not too many minigames, and can be a little confusing, 5 bucks you can find a better game.","Jun 2, 2020 at 6:14 AM",2, 1,"Hi mr. Ravin, thanks for the review! The throwing mechanics work only regarding physics simulations, as per how Unreal Engines simulates it, we do not give any kind of assistance, but your feedback seems to look like we should give a aim assist for some players. We are about to add 4 to 6 games in a next update, hope you like it."
2022-05-28 19:15:41.466841,longface64,this game is bad,the game can hardly work and there arent that many things to do and the few things that you can do are extremely boring (DON'T BUY THIS GAME),"Jul 3, 2020 at 2:44 AM",1, 0,"Hi man, thanks for the review. We would really appreciate if you could be more specific than this, we work hard to make something fun to play and be watched to play (as stated before this game excels when played as a party game). Nevertheless we always say what the game is about and how you play it, I think the decision of buy it falls on each one. Thanks!"
2022-05-28 19:15:44.587494,MikeTV2000,Good Content : Starting Over Sucks,"They came a long way from the original complaints over content and the current version. There is some improvement, like 2nd level running from giant. The major problem is no continuance. I do not mind improving my performance from 2nd level of giant, but to do 20+ runs to do so SUCKS. I give it 3 stars because I baught it on sale. It would be a solid 3-4 if you could continue after you die.","Jun 15, 2019 at 12:19 PM",3, 3,"Thanks for the review Mike, we want to add the ability to select the minigame, would that satisfy you? Cheers!"
2022-05-28 19:15:44.603452,thumbtackVR,Quite Fun,"I got this game for $0.99 on sale, and I was suprised to have a good experience based on the price. It features a few minigames such as running from a yeti giant and throwing torches at incoming ships. You do minigames endlessly and they get more difficult as you progress. It lasted me a good 2 hours trying to beat my highscore.
-Ran Great
-Fun Graphics
-Decent replayability
This is a perfect game for someone new to VR, and to show to friends.","Jun 10, 2019 at 4:24 AM",5, 1,"Thank you so much for your review! You got the idea of the game, we understood it to be a great entry experience, one that you can show to your friends and not spend half-hour explaining the controls ;)"
2022-05-28 19:15:44.618412,dominicmills,pretty good,"So i really like most of the activities but some of them are boring and easy
the axe throwing one is almost impossible to succeed in as it never registers as me hitting the targets
the drinking game is boring and easy too, same with the dragon one
other than that the game is really fun as its kinda like a dum-ways-to-die type 
game



Yeah so i dont think i was clear enough, you should get rid of the drinking game and the dragon one, maybe add some more activities","Jun 6, 2019 at 6:59 PM",4, 0,"Thanks for the review and the tips! The dragon game and drink gets more challenging as you play more, but they are really easy at the start. The axe depends on hitting the metal on the target... most plp find it hard, that is true! Thanks for your feedback!"

It gets to the point where they are almost impossible for humans to finish... if you game is not getting further than 7 days, please tell us!"

Subsiquent runs, Textures missing, and/or Blank frames obscuring menus.

2022-05-28 19:15:47.757017,jutjut1134,"Decent game for price, fatal errors cnst","Needs a little more work with stability. Constantly crashes. Look for some polish before you buy.

UPDATE
Bug Fixes abound. Game plays great and the mini games are fun. A great easy access game for new comers and when you showcase to friends. well worth the price.
